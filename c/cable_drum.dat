50|$|A {{torsion spring}} {{counterbalance}} system consists {{of one or}} two tightly wound up springs on a steel shaft with <b>cable</b> <b>drums</b> at both ends. The entire apparatus mounts on the header wall above the garage door and has three supports: a center bearing plate with a steel or nylon bearing and two end bearing plates at both ends. The springs themselves consist of the steel wire with a stationary cone at one end and a winding cone at the other end. The stationary cone is attached to the center bearing plate. The winding cone consists of holes every 90 degrees for winding the springs and two set screws to secure the springs to the shaft. Steel counterbalance cables run from the roller brackets at the bottom corners of the door to a notch in the <b>cable</b> <b>drums.</b> When the door is raised, the springs unwind and the stored tension lifts the door by turning the shaft, thus turning the <b>cable</b> <b>drums,</b> wrapping the <b>cables</b> around the grooves on the <b>cable</b> <b>drums.</b> When the door is lowered, the cables unwrap from the drums and the springs are rewound to full tension.|$|R

25|$|On chain timpani, {{the tension}} rods are {{connected}} by a roller chain {{much like the one}} found on a bicycle, though some manufacturers have used other materials, including steel cable. In these systems, all the tension screws can then be tightened or loosened by one handle. Though far less common than pedal timpani, chain and <b>cable</b> <b>drums</b> still have practical uses. Occasionally, a timpanist is forced to place a drum behind other items, so he cannot reach it with his foot. Professionals may also use exceptionally large or small chain and <b>cable</b> <b>drums</b> for special low or high notes.|$|R

50|$|The {{total weight}} (all-up weight) of the {{installation}} machine comprises: the <b>cable</b> <b>drum</b> and cable; the wrapping mechanism; the motive power unit; the tension control mechanism and the counterweight system. All of these individual components are necessary, but some components {{may be combined}} {{to increase the efficiency}} of the design. For example, those designs using electric motors tend to use the battery pack as part of the counterweight system. Counterweights are required for two separate purposes: to counter the turning moment of the wrapping machine and to balance the <b>cable</b> <b>drum</b> payload.|$|E
50|$|The {{endless rope}} for the incline {{was driven by}} two beam engines at Cowlairs, of the high {{pressure}} type, made by Kerr, Neilson and Company of Glasgow. They had 28 inch cylinders, and 72 inch stroke. The crankshaft had a spur wheel of 12 feet diameter, which drove the <b>cable</b> <b>drum</b> through gearing. The main <b>cable</b> <b>drum</b> was 18 feet in diameter, mounted in a pit under the track. The beam engines were supplied with steam at 50 psi by 8 boilers, each 30 feet long and 5 feet diameter.|$|E

50|$|The {{lower part}} of the {{launcher}} is constructed of a stainless steel framework, within which the vehicle is stored. Pressure hulls for electronic devices, a winch, a secondary <b>cable</b> <b>drum</b> and two electric transformers are located in {{the upper part of the}} launcher. The samplers include a gravity core sampler and a bottom grab sampler. There is also a docking system and an acoustic positioning system in the {{lower part of}} the launcher. The vehicle is hung in the launcher by the docking system. When the system detaches it and the <b>cable</b> <b>drum</b> feeds the secondary cable, the vehicle can dive down, and its position is measured by the acoustic positioning system. The position of the launcher is measured by RV Kairei, the support ship. The launcher also has a high-definition television (HDTV) camera with pan and tilt functions.|$|E

40|$|This project {{concerns}} large <b>cable</b> <b>drums</b> made of steel. <b>Cable</b> <b>drums</b> are cylindrical structures used {{to transport}} {{different kinds of}} cables or wires. The ones in focus in this work are used to transport very stiff and heavy cables to offshore sites in the oil industry. To reduce weight in structures is always of great interest, and for <b>cable</b> <b>drums,</b> that are designed according to standards, {{there is much that}} can be improved. The aim of this project is to predict the loads acting on a drum during the winding of cables. This was accomplished by performing explicit finite element simulations of the winding sequence. Modeling and meshing were done using LS-PrePost and ANSA, and the winding was simulated using LS-DYNA. LS-PrePost was also used to analyze the results, together with mETApost. A number of simplifications and delimitations have been made {{in order to make the}} simulation possible within the time frame of the project. Simplified models of both the <b>cable</b> and the <b>drum</b> have been used. Winding velocities in real life are really slow, so in order to reduce simulation times, the winding velocity had to be increased while still avoiding dynamic effects. From this, contact forces between the <b>drum</b> and the <b>cable</b> could be obtained. The contact forces were investigated with respect to different friction values between the <b>cable</b> and the <b>drum,</b> for the <b>cable</b> itself and also for different cable stiffnesses. The results obtained from the simulations provide contact force distributions for different parts of the drum. Much fewer rows and layers of cable were winched than in real life, and it is therefore hard to see any clear trends in the obtained forces. However, one important result of the contact forces, is that a previously used assumption, namely that the pretension of the cable only applies loads to a small fraction of the drum, was a bit too conservative. According to the simulations it actually gets distributed over the whole drum. It is hard to draw any conclusions from the obtained contact forces, due to the small size of the simulations. The conclusion one can draw from this report, is that it is fully possible to use finite element tools to simulate the winding sequence of <b>cable</b> <b>drums</b> and this report presents a methodology on how to achieve this. LS-DYNA handles the contact definitions in an adequate way and is, according to the authors, a strong candidate for future work in this area. ...|$|R

As the battleship sank rapidly, {{the line from}} Monarch quickly played out, releasing the tug. However, Hercules cables did not release until the last possible moment, leaving her tossing and pitching above the grave of the sunken Oklahoma. The battleship's exact location is unknown.|$|R
50|$|Prime movers {{were used}} to tow field {{artillery}} pieces, they also transported gun crews, equipment, and ammunition. They had a pintle hitch at the rear for towing up to 40,000 lb. Another pintle at the front {{could be used to}} emplace the piece. A mid-mounted 25,000 lb winch had a centered <b>cable</b> <b>drum</b> and a capstan on the right side. Pulleys and rollers routed the cable under the body and out the rear frame cross-member.|$|E
5000|$|There {{was once}} a little [...] "mountain railway" [...] on Carningli, {{carrying}} broken stone from a small quarry down to a crushing plant on the Cilgwyn Road. Some railway sleepers can still {{be found in the}} turf, but otherwise the only traces remaining are the two stone pillars that supported a <b>cable</b> <b>drum</b> — a cable was used to control the descent of the loaded wagons as they rolled downhill, and then to pull the empty ones back up again. This little industry was abandoned before 1930.|$|E

To the right of the door is a large opening through which can be seen two large <b>cable</b> <b>drums</b> with extant steel cable. The plant located within the winding house includes a two-cylinder steam winding engine (Walkers Limited No. 847 1903).|$|R
5000|$|A Corvair truck {{could be}} ordered as a [...] "Loadside" [...] or [...] "Rampside". The Loadside was {{essentially}} a pickup truck with a standard tail gate. The Loadside was only produced two years and is the rarest of the Corvairs; production totaled 2,844 in 1961 and 369 in 1962. The Rampside had a side ramp {{to be used for}} loading and unloading cargo. These were used by the Bell Telephone Company, because loading and unloading of <b>cable</b> <b>drums</b> was eased by the side ramp.|$|R
50|$|A special type of overshot/backshot {{wheel is}} the {{reversible}} water wheel. This has {{two sets of}} blades or buckets running in opposite directions, {{so that it can}} turn in either direction depending on which side the water is directed. Reversible wheels were used in the mining industry in order to power various means of ore conveyance. By changing the direction of the wheel, barrels or baskets of ore could be lifted up or lowered down a shaft or inclined plane. There was usually a <b>cable</b> <b>drum</b> or a chain basket (German: Kettenkorb) on the axle of the wheel. It is essential that the wheel have braking equipment to be able to stop the wheel (known as a braking wheel). The oldest known drawing of a reversible water wheel was by Georgius Agricola and dates to 1556.|$|E
50|$|Most {{wrapping}} machine designs carry a single drum of cable {{on one side}} of the machine and therefore require a counterweight on the opposite side to provide lateral stability. As a minimum, the counterweight is adjustable at each pole or tower to reflect the reduced weight of the payload at the end of each span. The more sophisticated designs of {{wrapping machine}}s have automatically adjusting counterweights that maintain balance throughout the span as the <b>cable</b> <b>drum</b> becomes progressively lighter. This is normally achieved by arranging for the counterweight move inwards towards the machine axis as the machine travels forward. Such devices are essential for span lengths greater than 250 - 300m. Ideally, the centre of gravity of the rotating part of the wrapping machine should lie on the axis of the host conductor at all times. The centre of gravity of the complete wrapping machine will always be below the axis of the host conductor.|$|E
5000|$|The term {{can be used}} {{to refer}} to the basic cable as may be {{obtained}} from a supplier, or a cable with the ends terminated in either a multipin connector, a number of separate connectors on the individual pairs, or a box or panel with a number of chassis-mounted connectors. Different termination methods can be used on each end to suit the application. When individual connectors are used, three pin XLR connectors are most common, although 1/4" [...] jack connectors are also occasionally used. Assembled audio multicore cables are found in both portable applications, where they are stored loose or on a <b>cable</b> <b>drum,</b> {{so that they can be}} taken from one location to another, or are permanently installed in a building. The availability of portable snakes enables sound engineers to set up sound systems at temporary outdoor locations, such as music festivals. Snakes are permanently installed in the walls of recording studios and performance venues such as arts centres and large nightclubs.|$|E
30|$|The {{prototype}} design {{consists of}} two DC motors and planetary gear heads (A) powered by two motor controllers (B) connected to two quadrature encoders (C) (Figure  1). Two <b>cable</b> <b>drums</b> (D) transfer the required torque to the ankle through the shock-absorbing nylon rope (E). The rope is securely attached to the <b>cable</b> <b>drums</b> to avoid slippage. A universal joint (F) connects the pylon to the foot and is supported by an elastomer to provide passive stiffness and damping to the ankle. The cable is directed to the foot with pulleys (G). The cable {{is attached to a}} carbon fiber plate (H), which is connected to a commercially available prosthetic foot (Otto Bock Axtion®) (I). In the rear side of the carbon fiber plate, the cable is mounted to both sides of the longitudinal axis of the foot. At the front side of the carbon fiber plate, the cable passes through a pulley (J). Torque feedback, which will be explored later, is provided by six strain gauges in the foot (K) using two strain gauge amplifiers (L). An analog to digital converter (M) is connected to a remote computer and is used to acquire the sensors data and provide the motor controllers’ inputs.|$|R
