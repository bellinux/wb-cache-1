40|$|The NASA Office of Chief Technologist has funded from FY 11 through FY 14 {{successive}} {{studies of}} the physics, design, and spacecraft integration of a Fission Fragment Rocket Engine (FFRE) that directly converts the momentum of fission fragments continuously into spacecraft momentum at a theoretical specific impulse above one million seconds. While others have promised future propulsion advances if only you have the patience, the FFRE requires no waiting, no advances in physics and no advances in manufacturing processes. Such an engine unequivocally can create {{a new era of}} space exploration that can change spacecraft operation. The NIAC (NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts) Program Phase 1 study of FY 11 first investigated how the revolutionary FFRE technology could be integrated into an advanced spacecraft. The FFRE combines existent technologies of low density fissioning dust trapped electrostatically and high field strength superconducting magnets for beam management. By organizing the nuclear core material to permit sufficient mean free path for escape of the fission fragments and by collimating the beam, this study showed the FFRE could convert nuclear power to thrust directly and efficiently at a delivered specific impulse of 527, 000 seconds. The FY 13 study showed that, without increasing the reactor power, adding a neutral gas to the fission fragment beam significantly increased the FFRE thrust through in a manner analogous to a jet engine afterburner. This frictional interaction of gas and beam resulted in an engine that continuously produced 1000 pound force of thrust at a delivered impulse of 32, 000 seconds, thereby reducing the currently studied DRM 5 round trip mission to Mars from 3 years to 260 days. By decreasing the gas addition, this same engine can be tailored for much lower thrust at much higher impulse to match missions to more distant destinations. These studies created host spacecraft concepts configured for manned round trip journeys. While the vehicles are very large, they are primarily made up of a habitat payload on one end, the engine on the opposite end and a connecting spine containing radiator acreage needed to reject the heat of this powerful, but inefficient engine. These studies concluded that the engine and spacecraft are within today's technology, could be built, tested, launched on several SLS launchers, integrated, checked out, maintained at an in-space LEO base, and operated for decades just as Caribbean cruise ships operate today. The nuclear issues were found to be far less daunting that [than for] current nuclear engines. The FFRE produces very small amounts of radioactive efflux compared to their impulse, easily contained in an evacuated "bore-hole" test site. The engine poses no launch risk since it is simply a structure containing no fissionable material. The nuclear fuel is carried to orbit in containers highly <b>crash-proofed</b> for launch accidents from which it, in a liquid medium, is injected into the FFRE.

40|$|Reliability in {{computer}} or engineering systems is undoubtedly a key requirement {{in the development}} process. Safety within critical control systems, and reliable data transfers, require tolerance to unexpected and unwanted phenomena. In biology, new cells can replace damaged cells [1], DNA is able to repair and replicate with error control [1]. These processes are essential to maintain the overall organism. Biology has often been a successful inspiration in computation (artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms, ant colony optimisation, etc) although conventional computation differs widely from natural computation. In this respect, [2] introduced systemic computation (SC), a model of interacting systems with natural characteristics and suggested a new computer architecture. Following this work, [3] introduced a systemic computer as a virtual machine running on conventional computers. In this paper we show, using a genetic algorithm implementation running on this platform, how <b>crash-proof</b> programs following the SC paradigm have native fault-tolerance and easily integrated self-maintenance.

40|$|The Minimalist Program {{is guided}} {{by the idea that}} the {{syntactic}} system of the language faculty is designed to optimally meet design specifications imposed by the interface systems.

We explore the feasibility of constructing such a system, one {{in which there is no}} notion of “crashing derivations”. We also argue that both the interface conditions and the derivational system which is designed to satisfy them are real, and in this sense we expect to find a pervasive redundancy in linguistic explanation. By demanding that the derivational system be <b>crash-proof,</b> without filters imposed on its end products, we hope to help draw the boundary between the derivational system and the interface conditions, and to make progress in understanding both. 1.

40|$|Natural systems provide unique {{examples}} of computation {{in a form}} very different from contemporary computer architectures. Biology also demonstrates capabilities such as adaptation, self-repair and self-organisation that are becoming increasingly desirable for our technology. To address these issues a computer model and architecture with natural characteristics is presented. Systemic computation is Turing Complete; {{it is designed to}} support biological algorithms such as neural networks, evolutionary algorithms and models of development, and shares the desirable capabilities of biology not found in conventional architectures. In this chapter we describe the first platform implementing such computation, including programming language, compiler and virtual machine. We first demonstrate that systemic computing is <b>crash-proof</b> and can recover from severe damage. We then illustrate various benefits of systemic computing through several implementations of bio-inspired algorithms: a self-adaptive genetic algorithm, a bio-inspired model of artificial neural networks, and finally we create an "artificial organism "- a program with metabolism that eats data, expels waste, clusters cells based on data inputs and emits danger signals for a potential artificial immune system.

40|$|In a {{distributed}} system, {{replication of}} components, such as objects, {{is a well}} known way of achieving availability. For increased availability, crashed and disconnected components must be replaced by new components on available spare nodes. This replacement results in {{the membership of the}} replicated group 'walking ' over a number of machines during system operation. In this context, we address the problem of reconfiguring a group after the group as an entity has failed. Such a failure is termed a group failure which, for example, can be the crash of every component in the group or the group being partitioned into minority islands. The solution assumes <b>crash-proof</b> storage, and eventual recovery of crashed nodes and healing of partitions. It guarantees that (i) the number of groups reconfigured after a group failure is never more than one, and (ii) the reconfigured group contains a majority of the components which were members of the group just before the group failure occurred, so that the loss of state information due to a group failure is minimal. Though the protocol is subject to blocking, it remains efficient in terms of communication rounds and use of stable store, during both normal operations and reconfiguration after a group failure...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a theoretical}} {{investigation of the}} thesis of Minimalist Interfaces, namely, that syntax-external linguistic interfaces that interact with the core syntactic computation and language-independent sound and concept systems play a more critical role in manipulating syntactic objects to make them legible to those systems than is currently assumed in the recent minimalist inquiry. The core theme of this thesis lies in the idea that syntax is not entirely <b>crash-proof</b> but could make a variety of derivational mistakes; phonological and semantic linguistic interfaces conduct a handful of independent domain-specific operations to attempt to legitimize illicit syntactic objects, if any, {{for the purposes of}} legibility at the language-external sound and concept systems. Evidence is provided that the syntax-external components use whatever resources they can to repair certain "imperfections" created by syntax but only within the range of options made available by the universal principles of syntax in tandem with the language-specific parameter values. This dissertation explores some of the ramifications and empirical consequences of this thesis based on the comprehensive description of a sizable portion of the grammar of Indonesian and Javanese collected by my fieldwork with three native Indonesian and Javanese consultants. Phenomena discussed here include the distribution of active voice morphology, P-stranding under sluicing, the denotation and morphosyntax of bare nominals, wh-in-situ questions, and reduplication asymmetries between nominal and verbal derivational affixes. These diverse ranges of phenomena in the two languages are analyzed in depth to provide converging evidence that the thesis of minimalist interface as defined above yields a deep understanding of the way the syntax interacts with the language-dependent interfaces responsible for phonological and semantic interpretation. The investigation conducted here, necessitates serious reconsideration of the commonly held view of linguistic interfaces as passive, merely ornamental components of natural language grammar ruled by the universal law of syntax...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reveals an}} apparent paradox presented by Chinese which confronts current theories of Universal Grammar, parametric variation, and typology of human languages. Specifically, Chinese presents {{a problem for}} the feature inheritance hypothesis (Richards 2007; Chomsky 2007, 2008; Miyagawa 2010) because Chinese seems to manifest neither phi-features/Agree on T nor the freedom to raise any topic phrase to spec-TP (a hallmark feature of discourse-configurational languages like Finnish). That is, the UG-typology advanced under the feature inheritance hypotheses seems to exclude Chinese. In view of this apparent paradox, I investigate the distribution and motivation of A-movement in Chinese in chapter 2 and argue that Chinese is in fact compatible with Miyagawa’s feature inheritance approach. I contend that Chinese displays A-movement motivated by two distinct forces: the Case feature (see Epstein and Seely 2006, Bošković 2002) and the Topic feature (as in Miyagawa 2010). Chapter 3 investigates the question of whether Chinese lacks phi-features/Agree altogether by examining the blocking effects observed in the long-distance construal of the reflexive ziji (see Huang and Liu 2001) and the formation of Chinese wh-the-hell questions (see Huang and Ochi 2004 and Chou 2012). I contend that these two types of blocking effects receive a unified analysis if we assume phi-Agree exists at the CP level in Chinese, and involves [Speaker] and [Participant] features. Chapter 4 examines the derivation of locative inversion in English and Chinese, particularly focusing on why T-to-C inversion is not allowed in English locative inversion, whereas the counterpart operation is allowed in Chinese. I argue that (i) locative inversion in both English and Chinese is topic A-movement, and (ii) the possible presence of φ-features on T and the categorial status of the locative phrase jointly determine whether a language can implement T-to-C inversion in locative inversion. Chapter 5 discusses two foundational theoretical implications, including (i) how to express the A/A'-distinction in languages without φ-features on T, and (ii) the postulation of featurally <b>crash-proof</b> grammar in which uninterpretable features present at the CI interface do not cause crash (see Frampton and Guttman 2002; Carstens 2011; Epstein, Kitahara and Seely 2010; Putnam 2010) ...|$|E
