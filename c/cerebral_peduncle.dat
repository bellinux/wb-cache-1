2500|$|Nerve fibres in the corticospinal tract {{originate}} from pyramidal cells in layer V of the cerebral cortex. Fibres {{arise from the}} primary motor cortex (about 30%), supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex (together also about 30%), and the somatosensory cortex, parietal lobe, and cingulate gyrus supplies the rest. The cells have their bodies in the cerebral cortex, and the axons form {{the bulk of the}} pyramidal tracts. [...] The nerve axons travel from the cortex through the posterior limb of internal capsule, through the <b>cerebral</b> <b>peduncle</b> and into the brainstem and anterior medulla oblongata. Here they form two prominences called the medulla oblongatary pyramids. Below the prominences, the majority of axons cross over to the opposite side from which they originated, known as decussation. The axons that cross over move to the outer part of the medulla oblongata and form the lateral corticospinal tract, whereas the fibres that remain form the anterior corticospinal tract. [...] About 80% of axons cross over and form the lateral corticospinal tract; 10% do not cross over and join the tract, and 10% of fibres travel in the anterior corticospinal tract.|$|E

50|$|The <b>cerebral</b> <b>peduncles</b> {{are located}} {{on either side of}} the {{midbrain}} and are the frontmost part of the midbrain, and act as the connectors between the rest of the midbrain and the thalamic nuclei and thus the cerebrum. As a whole, the <b>cerebral</b> <b>peduncles</b> assists in refining motor movements, learning of new motor skills, and converting proprioceptive information into balance and posture maintenance. Important fiber tracts that run through the <b>cerebral</b> <b>peduncles</b> are: cortico-spinal, cortico-pontine, and cortico-bulbar tracts.|$|R

50|$|The Kernohan's notch {{phenomenon}} {{is unique in}} that it is not only a false localizing sign, but is also ipsilateral or same-sided. The left <b>cerebral</b> <b>peduncle</b> contains motor fibers that cross over to {{the right side of the}} body. Thus, if you have a right hemisphere trans-tentorial herniation, it causes a Kernohan's notch in the left <b>cerebral</b> <b>peduncle</b> which results in right-sided motor impairment. Therefore you get, paradoxically, impairment of motor function on the same side of the body as the herniation which caused the Kernohan's notch on the controlateral side.|$|E

50|$|The basal vein passes {{backward}} {{around the}} <b>cerebral</b> <b>peduncle,</b> and {{ends in the}} internal cerebral vein (vein of Galen); it receives tributaries from the interpeduncular fossa, the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle, the hippocampal gyrus, and the mid-brain.|$|E
50|$|The Interpeduncular nucleus is an unpaired, {{ovoid cell}} {{group at the}} base of the {{midbrain}} tegmentum. It is located in the mesencephalon below the interpeduncular fossa. As the name suggests, the interpeduncular nucleus lies in between the <b>cerebral</b> <b>peduncles.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The interpeduncular fossa is a {{somewhat}} rhomboid-shaped {{area of the}} base of the brain, limited in front by the optic chiasma, behind by the antero-superior surface of the pons, antero-laterally by the converging optic tracts, and postero-laterally by the diverging <b>cerebral</b> <b>peduncles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The skull is an {{incompressible}} {{closed space}} with a limited volume (Monro-Kellie Doctrine). When there is increased cranial pressure in the brain, {{a shift in the}} brain forms towards the only opening of the skull, the foramen magnum. Thus, when an increase of pressure in a hemisphere of the brain exists, the <b>cerebral</b> <b>peduncle</b> on the opposite hemisphere is pushed up against the tentorium, which separates the posterior fossa from the middle fossa. This produces a visible [...] "notch" [...] in the <b>cerebral</b> <b>peduncle.</b> Because of the fact that a Kernohan's notch is caused by an injury creating pressure on the opposite hemisphere of the brain, it is characterized as a false localizing sign.|$|E

50|$|The {{corticobulbar tract}} {{originates}} {{in the primary}} motor cortex of the frontal lobe, just superior to the lateral fissure and rostral to the central sulcus in the precentral gyrus also known as Brodmann area 4. The tract descends through the corona radiata and genu of the internal capsule with a few fibers in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, as it passes from the cortex down to the midbrain. In the midbrain, the internal capsule becomes the <b>cerebral</b> <b>peduncles.</b> The white matter {{is located in the}} ventral portion of the <b>cerebral</b> <b>peduncles,</b> called the crus cerebri. The middle third of the crus cerebri contains the corticobulbar and corticospinal fibers. The corticobulbar fibers exit at the appropriate level of the brainstem to synapse on the lower motor neurons of the cranial nerves.|$|R
50|$|One {{mnemonic}} for {{remembering the}} structures of the midbrain involves visualizing the mesencephalic cross-section as an upside down bear face.
