The research was conducted at Leuwikopo Seed Science and Technology Laboratory, from February 2012 to January 2013. There were three experiments, i. e. I. Effect of seed maturity level on seed viability and vigor (randomized completely block design, 3 seed maturity level, 3 replications); II. Determination of seed <b>critical</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> used two methods, i. e. 1) fan drying and 2) air drying (completely randomized design in each drying methods, 3 replications); III. Effect of temperature and period of storage on seed viability and vigor (nested design, first factor was 2 storage temperature and the second factor was 7 storage periods, 3 replications). The result showed that seed physiological maturity achieved in 28 weeks after flowering with morphological criteria were brownish fruit, soft fruit exocarp, brown seed testa; physiological criteria was germination percentage 76 - 80 % and biochemical criteria was carotenoid content 0. 62 µmol(g FW) - 1.

40|$|Water {{repellency}} {{occurs in}} most irrigated soils, but is most pronounced in coarse sands and sandy soils due to accumulation of hydrophobic compounds on soil particles or to physiochemical changes in soil organic matter. As soils dry, hydrophobic compounds polymerize and water repellency increases. Once a <b>critical</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> is reached soils shift from wettable to non-wettable, impacting infiltration and unsaturated flow in affected soils, and consequently water use efficiency and turf quality. Surfactant formulations were evaluated on water repellent or susceptible soils at diverse test {{locations in the}} United States, the Netherlands and Australia.

30|$|To {{understand}} and predict hygrobuckling behavior of orthotropic or isotropic wood-based composite panels, the closed form equations were derived using both the displacement function {{with a double}} sine series and the energy method under biaxial compressions with an all-clamped-edge condition. The <b>critical</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> depended on Poisson's ratio (ν) and was inversely proportional to 1 +ν for isotropic panels. It did {{not depend on the}} modulus of elasticity (MOE) at all for isotropic panels, but it did depend on MOE ratios for orthotropic panels. As expected, the <b>critical</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> of plywood was twice as large as the that of hardboard owing to the difference in linear expansions between the two panels. The application of optimum thickness and aspect ratios obtained by the derived equations could improve hygrobuckling resistance without other chemical treatments that could reduce the linear expansion of wood-based panels. This study also indicated {{that it would be better}} to increase the aspect ratio rather than the thickness ratio (a/h) from the view-point economics.|$|E
40|$|Only very recently, it {{has become}} evident that soil {{hydrophobicity}} is wide-spread in the world. Generally, soil hydrophobicity {{is caused by the}} presence of organic compounds, like humic and fulvic acids and fatty waxes, which are able to coat individual soil particles and aggregates. These organic compounds might become water repellent below a certain critical soil water content due to molecular conformational changes. Above the <b>critical</b> soil <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> a soil behaves wettable and below it hydrophobic. Due to the presence of hydrophobic coatings, soil water retention functions show typical hysteresis loops in the range below the critical soil water content. Generally, it can be stated that wetting branches below the <b>critical</b> soil <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> are very steeply curved with low water entry values, while wetting branches above the critical soil water contents are generally gently curved with much higher water entry values. Due to these typical water retention branches, perturbations at an infiltrating wetting front might grow into vertically directed preferential flow paths in initially dry soil (i. e. under conditions below the <b>critical</b> soil <b>moisture</b> <b>content),</b> causing an accelerated downward transport of water and solutes in this case. In the opposite situation, with initial soil water contents exceeding the critical soil water value, perturbations at a...|$|R

In this context, the <b>critical</b> admissible <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> must be known. The porous {{structure of a}} series of different building materials has been characterized. The porosity and pore size distribution has been determined on 3 different types of autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC), on samples made of hardened cement paste with 3 different water-cement ratios, on natural sandstone and on burned brick.

40|$|Soil {{strength}} {{is an important}} quality of agricultural soils prone to traffic. Surface hardness (SH) measured by the clegg impact tester (CIT) was evaluated as an indicator for assessing soil strength. Proctor tests were performed on a diverse range of soils to examine the relationships between bulk density (BD), penetration resistance (PR), SH and water con-tent. All three indices showed typical response curves with increasing water content, with notable differences among the soils. Maximum dry bulk density (MDBD), peak penetration resistance (PPR) and peak surface hardness (PSH) showed values of 1. 98 Mg·m− 3, 8. 2 MPa and 248 Cmax for Piarco, River Estate and Piarco respectively.

40|$|New {{products}} from Gac, an indigenous fruit of Vietnam have been recently {{found in the}} worldwide markets as the aril part of the fruit has a high content of lycopene and β-carotene. These carotenoids are currently in special demand as they are natural antioxidants with potential to prevent and treat cancers. This study investigated some processing approaches {{for the production of}} powder from Gac arils and used currently developed analytical methods to measure the product qualities. The process development focused on the selection of a pre-treatment method before seed removal and a dehydration technique to minimise the degradation of the carotenoids after processing. The heat and enzymatic pre-treatments could be applied in an industrial-scale seed removal. However, using the same drying method the powder produced without enzymatic pre-treatment had a higher carotenoid content than the enzymatic-treated powder. Constant drying rates and <b>critical</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> on a solid basis were measured for oven drying, air drying and vacuum drying. Spray drying and freeze drying were also attempted. Freeze-drying resulted in the Gac powder with the brightest colour and the highest level of carotenoids. The average loss of carotenoids of five Gac powder samples after pre-treatment and dehydration was 35 %.

40|$|The {{complete}} drying {{history of}} paper dried under {{an array of}} multiple round jets of air was determined. The drying rate - paper moisture content relations, determined as a continuous function by on-line measurements for about 80 sheets, permitted examination of the following parameters: basis weight 20 to 50 g/m(2), which covers the tissue to communication paper range; initial moisture content 1. 5 to 3 kg water/kg frbre; nozzle to paper spacing of 5, 7. 6 and 8. 5 nozzle diameters; nozzle plate open area ratio from 1. 4 to 3. 1 %; jet Reynolds number {{in the range of}} 450 to 11, 100. Three methods of quantifying the complete drying rate curves were tested. Use of the common assumption of drying rate linear with moisture content over the falling rate Period gave inadequate representation. Secondly, the general method of Churchill for any transport process that has a transition between two asymptotic relations was applied {{for the first time to}} the drying of paper. This approach gives statistically valid fits, but was rejected because the values of the constant drying rate were generally too high and because the method does not give a <b>critical</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> A power law treatment of the falling rate period provided a good representation of the complete drying rate curves as well as realistic values of the constant drying rate and <b>critical</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> To reduce subjectivity, a statistical program provided for each drying rate curve the best fit values of three parameters, the constant drying rate, <b>critical</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> and the exponent for the power law falling rate period relationship.

In our approach the ring shear tester is used to measure the cohesiveness and flowability of a model particulated food system based on fresh green pea powders and pastes with controlled moisture content. The focus is on how the cohesiveness and flowability of dry pea particles change as they absorb moisture, swell and soften, while continuously agglomerating until a paste like bolus is achieved. Differently hydrated pea powders start to granulate with increasing moisture content resulting in decreasing flowability and increasing cohesiveness until a <b>critical</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> of approximately 73 wt% is reached.

Constant impingement water removal decreases linearly with through flow ratio at a fixed impingement exhaust air flow. Constant through flow water removal is independent of the impingement air. <b>Critical</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> relates with through flow ratio parabolically. The maximum through flow water removal rate depends on {{the slope of the}} paper temperature increase and the extent of the secondary increasing rate period which increases with paper basis weight and drying air temperature, but decreases with through flow ratio and initial moisture content...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to obtain and model drying curves of filmogenic solutions at the temperatures of 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45  °C, consisting of different concentrations of starch and glycerol. The percentage of yam starch influenced the initial moisture content, while the <b>critical</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> varied as a function of the concentration of starch and temperature applied during drying of the filmogenic solutions. Glycerol concentration did not influence any of the parameters analyzed. Models for the two distinct phases (constant and decreasing drying periods) fit well for all drying temperatures and compositions, with average relative error values less than 10 %. The interaction between starch content and temperature influenced the drying rate parameters during the constant period and the diffusion coefficients...|$|E
40|$|In a {{study of}} the {{influence}} of residual moisture on the potency of freeze-dried smallpox vaccine, vaccine lots with <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> between 0. 36 % and 6. 7 % were used. These lots were stored at 4 °C, 24 °C, and 37 °C for up to 6 months, or were exposed to 100 °C for up to 3 hours, and were sampled at regular time intervals for assay. No loss in potency occurred at 4 °C where the <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> was 4. 8 % or less. At 24 °C the <b>critical</b> <b>moisture</b> level was 2. 5 %, and at 37 °C it was 0. 36 %. At 100 °C the potency loss was more rapid and there were significant losses after 1 hour at a moisture level of 2. 4 % or more. A residual <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> of less than 1 % seems to be essential for satisfactory storage of freeze-dried smallpox vaccine...|$|R
40|$|A {{thermal imager}} {{was used for}} {{measuring}} the canopy temperature to calculate crop water stress index (CWSI) of rice under water deficit condition. The CWSI varied diurnally with peaks appeared at noon, and soil water deficit led to higher CWSI values during noon. Transpiration rate (Tr), stomatal conductance (gs) and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) were high at low CWSI, and reduced with increasing CWSI. The relationship between CWSI and Pn, Tr or gs at noon was described by quadratic polynomial equations. At critical noon, CWSI values for the decline trend in Pn (0. 303, 0. 385 and 0. 446 at tillering, panicle initiation to booting, milk to soft dough stage) were higher than for decline in Tr and gs. Assuming a 5 % reduction in Pn from maximum is moderate water deficit, the critical CWSI values were 0. 420, 0. 472 and 0. 536 at tillering, panicle initiation to booting and milk to soft dough stages. CWSI at 14 : 00 decreased significantly with increasing relative soil <b>moisture</b> <b>contents.</b> There was a slight difference between the linear relations under different vapor pressure deficit (VPD) conditions. The <b>critical</b> relative soil <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> for a 5 % reduction in Pn were 1. 57 %, 1. 18 % and 1. 27 % higher under high VPD than low VPD conditions. It implied that rice water status was determined in conjunction with field soil <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> and air aridity. The water deficit diagnosis based on canopy temperature tracked by thermal infrared imager is a promising method in reflectin...|$|R
40|$|Sorption isotherms (<b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> as a {{function}} of relative humidity (RH) at equilibrium) are an important tool in designing buildings to limit moisture related problems. Normally only a single sorption curve is used so that each <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> uniquely corresponds to one RH. Sometimes two curves are used, one curve for absorption and one for desorption, as {{it is well known that}} sorption has a strong hysteresis for most materials. However, in most situations, materials do not simply follow either absorption or desorption, but will follow scanning curves within the hystersis envelope. In this paper we discuss data on sorption hysteresis and scanning for a cement based flooring material. These data show that the RH-increase will be many times higher when the flooring material absorbs moisture from, e. g., water based adhesives, than would have been predicted by a model without scanning. Implications for expressing <b>critical</b> <b>moisture</b> levels are discussed...|$|R
