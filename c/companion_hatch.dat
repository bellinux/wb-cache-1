5000|$|In the stories, Professor Van Dusen solves {{a variety}} of {{different}} mysteries with his friend and <b>companion,</b> Hutchinson <b>Hatch,</b> reporter of a fictional newspaper called The Daily New Yorker. The professor is known as [...] "The Thinking Machine", solving problems by the remorseless application of logic. This nickname was given to him after his winning of a match against the fictional chess champion of the day, Tschaikowsky, in a demonstration to show the power of applying pure logic. He was able to win against the reigning champion having only been taught the game the morning of the match. Many of his titles are actually honorary degrees awarded to him serving only to amuse the universities and scientific institutions that crown him with those titles. His catchphrases include, [...] "Two and two always equal four," [...] "Nothing is impossible," [...] and [...] "All things that start must go somewhere." ...|$|R
50|$|Japan: It is {{stated that}} Dragons in Japan {{tend to be}} bred for traits useful in combat, such as the Sui Riu's ability to inhale {{significant}} amounts of water and spit it out boiling. Dragons also {{are part of the}} ruling hierarchy of the nation, with most dragons taking the title of 'Lord' or 'Lady'. They will sometimes have a number of noble vassals, but are generally treated as Nobility among most Japanese citizens. Instead of taking <b>companions</b> when <b>hatched</b> (like British Dragons) or choosing one later in life (like Chinese), Japanese dragons are encouraged not to take a human companion. This is because they are indeed part of the hierarchy of nobility, and as such their opinions and wants should not be swayed should the law require it. Dragons with human companions are more likely to lean towards what ever may please their companion, rather than what would suit best for the situation.|$|R

6000|$|A {{little before}} midnight on Thursday last (the 24th), while I was rolling uneasily in my [...] "bunk," [...] contending with sleep and sea-{{sickness}}, and moralising on {{the madness of}} those who choose [...] "the sea" [...] for a profession, I was roused--and sickness instantly cured--by the watch on deck suddenly shouting down the hatchway to the mate, [...] "South-Sand-Head light is firing, sir, and sending up rockets." [...] The mate sprang from his [...] "bunk," [...] {{and was on the}} cabin floor before the sentence was well finished. I followed suit, and pulled on coat, nether garments, and shoes, as if my life depended on my own speed. There was unusual need for clothing, for the night was bitterly cold. A coat of ice had formed even on the salt-water spray which had blown into the boats. On gaining the deck, we found the two men on duty actively at work, the one loading the lee gun, the other adjusting a rocket to its stick. A few hurried questions from the mate elicited all that it was needful to know. The flash of a gun from the South-Sand-Head lightship, about six miles distant, had been seen, followed by a rocket, indicating that a vessel had got upon the fatal Goodwins. While the men spoke, I saw the bright flash of another gun, but heard no report, owing to the gale carrying the sound to leeward. A rocket followed, and at the same moment we observed the light of the vessel in distress just on the southern tail of the Sands. By this time our gun was charged, and the rocket in position. [...] "Look alive, Jack! get the poker," [...] cried the mate, as he primed the gun. Jack dived down the <b>companion</b> <b>hatch,</b> and in another moment returned with a red-hot poker, which the mate had thrust into the cabin fire at the first alarm. Jack applied it in quick succession to the gun and the rocket. A blinding flash and deafening crash were followed by the whiz of the rocket as it sprang with a magnificent curve far away into the surrounding darkness. This was our answer to the South-Sand-Head light, which, having fired three guns and three rockets to attract our attention, now ceased firing. It was also our note of warning to the look-out on the pier of Ramsgate Harbour. [...] "That's a beauty," [...] said our mate, referring to the rocket; [...] "get up another, Jack; sponge her well out. Jacobs, we'll give 'em another shot in a few minutes." [...] Loud and clear were both our signals; but four and a half miles of distance and a fresh gale neutralised their influence. The look-out did not see them. In less than five minutes the gun and rocket were fired again. Still no answering signal came from Ramsgate. [...] "Load the weather gun," [...] said the mate. Jacobs obeyed; and I sought shelter under the lee of the weather bulwarks, for the wind appeared to be composed of pen-knives and needles. Our third gun thundered forth, and shook the lightship from stem to stern; but the rocket struck the rigging, and made a low, wavering flight. Another was therefore sent up; but it had scarcely cut its bright line across the sky, when we observed the answering signal--a rocket from Ramsgate Pier.|$|E
5000|$|... At 0420 when in {{position}} 430 41' N. 18' 02' W., {{there was a}} loud explosion right aft and a flash followed by a stream of water came over the bridge from aft. The propeller was evidently blown off as the engineer told me afterwards that the engines raced violently before he could stop them. The torpedo struck aft a little on the starboard quarter, and as the crew’s accommodation was aft the thirteen casualties probably occurred in the crew’s quarters, which were completely shattered. The after gun platform was blown across the crew's accommodation <b>companion</b> <b>hatch</b> and had sealed it up, so there were no other means of escape.The ship settled gradually by the stern, so the chief officer was ordered to get away the lifeboats. The ship was rapidly taking up a perpendicular position and we abandoned her at 0440. I got into the lifeboat and pulled away clear and saw that the damage to the ships side was considerable. At 0600 the ship finally sank by the stern & at 0620 the survivors, including the two injured gunners were picked up by [...] & the casualties were immediately given medical attention.""Two gunners were on watch at the time at the 4" [...] one of whom, Nevard, was seriously injured by the blast from the explosion and had his leg broken in two places. Two of the other gunners, Langridge and Dowling, carried the injured man along the deck and up onto the boat-deck and placed him into a lifeboat and were undoubtedly responsible for the saving of Gunner Nevard's life. The gun layerHagon, who was suffering from internal injuries, managed to crawl unaided along to the boat-deck and into a boat, where he collapsed." ...|$|E
6000|$|The first {{adventure}} {{was such}} a storm as the little vessel had never yet encountered. The journal-letter thus describes it:--'On Saturday morning it began to blow from the north-east, {{and for the first}} time I experienced a circular gale or hurricane. Mrs. Somerville, I think, somewhere describes the nature of them in her [...] "Physical Geography." [...] The wind veered and hauled about a point or two, but blew from the north-east with great force, till about seven P.M. we could do no more with it and had to lie to. Ask old D. what that means, if you can't understand my description of it. The principle of it is to set two small sails, one fore and one aft, lash the rudder (wheel) amidships, make all snug, put on hatches, batten everything down, and trust to ride out the storm. As the vessel falls away from the wind by the action of one sail, it is brought up to it again by the other-sail. Thus her head is always kept to the wind, and she meets the seas, which if they caught her on the beam or the quarter would very likely send her down at once. About midnight on Saturday the wind suddenly chopped round to W.S.W., so that we were near the focus of the gale; it blew harder and harder till we took down the one sail forward, as the ropes and spars were enough for the wind to act upon. From 1 P.M. to 7 P.M. on Sunday it blew furiously. The whole sea was one drift of foam, and the surface of the water beaten down almost flat by the excessive violence of the wind, which cut off the head of every wave as it strove to raise itself, and carried it in clouds of spray and great masses of water, driving and hurling it against any obstacle, such as our little vessel, with inconceivable fury. As I stood on deck, gasping for breath, my eyes literally unable to keep themselves open, and only by glimpses getting a view of this most grand and terrible sight, it seemed as if a furious snow-storm was raging over a swelling, heaving, dark mass of waters. When anything could be seen beyond the first or second line of waves, the sky and sea appeared to meet in one cataract of rain and spray. A few birds were driving about like spirits of the storm. It was, as Shakspeare calls it, a regular hurly. Add to this the straining of the masts, the creaking of the planks, the shrill whistle of the wind in the ropes and cordage, the occasional crash of a heavy sea as it struck us with a sharp sound, and the rush of water over the decks, down the <b>companion</b> and <b>hatches,</b> that followed, and you have a notion of a gale of wind. And yet this was far from all the wind and sea can do, and we were never in any danger, I believe. That is, an unlucky sea at such a time may be fatal, and if anything about the schooner had been unsound it might have been awkward. At prayers, the Bishop read the prayer to be used in a storm, but I never myself entertained the idea of our being really in peril, nor did I suffer anything like the anxiety that I did when we were rounding Cape Palliser on our way to Wellington with the Judge. Here we had sea room and no fear of driving upon rocks. It is blowing a good deal now, as you see by my writing. I have a small ink-bottle of glass, made like an eel-pot (such as tax- gatherers use), tied to my buttonhole, and with this I can scribble away in almost any sea. Dear me! you could not sit still a minute, even now. I was qualmish on Saturday, and for a minute sick, but pretty comfortable on Sunday, though wearied by the constant pitching and rolling.' ...|$|R
