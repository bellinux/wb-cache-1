40|$|Abstractâ€”In microsurgery, {{the human}} hand imposes certain {{limitations}} in accurately positioning {{the tip of}} a device. Any errors in the motion of the hand make microsurgical procedures difficult, and involuntary motions can make some procedures difficult to perform with the bare hand. This is particularly true in the case of vitreoretinal microsurgery. The most familiar source of involuntary motion is physiological tremor. Real-time compensation of tremor would enable a surgeon to accurately perform microsurgery. A light-weight active handheld tremor <b>cancellation</b> <b>device</b> for micromanipulation is currently under development.

40|$|Job {{scheduling}} is a deceptively complex subfield {{of computer}} science. The highly combinatorial {{nature of the}} problem, which is NP-complete in nearly all cases, requires a scheduling program to intelligently transverse an immense search tree to create the best possible schedule in a minimal amount of time. In addition, the program must continually make adjustments to the initial schedule when faced with last-minute user requests, <b>cancellations,</b> unexpected <b>device</b> failures, quests, <b>cancellations,</b> unexpected <b>device</b> failures, etc. A good scheduler must be quick, flexible, and efficient, even {{at the expense of}} generating slightly less-than-optimal schedules. The Space Communication Scheduler (SCS) is an intelligent rule-based scheduling system. SCS is an adaptive deadline scheduler which allocates modular communications resources to meet an ordered set of user-specified job requests on board the NASA Space Station. SCS uses pattern matching techniques to detect potential conflicts through algorithmic and heuristic means.

However, the limited accessibility of large-size freestanding carbon nanotube aerogel sheets and other even more exotic materials recently investigated hampers the field. We describe alternative materials for a thermoacoustic heat source with high-energy conversion efficiency, additional functionalities, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective production technologies. We discuss the thermacoustic performance of alternative nanostructured materials and compare their spectral and power dependencies of sound pressure in air. We demonstrate that the heat capacity of aerogel-like nanostructures can be extracted by a thorough analysis of the sound pressure spectra.

3000|$|Back to our {{historical}} walk. In the 1990 s, adaptive filters for {{neural networks}} and particular fast versions of LS techniques {{were in the}} focus, so called Fast-RLS algorithms. Their theory is also based on minimum MSE (MMSE) but, due to their deterministic nature, independence assumptions were not required. To include them in practical applications, their LS nature was often sacrificed, and time-variant step-sizes were introduced. With such step-sizes, however, their nature was more along the stochastic, gradient-type algorithms. One of these RLS derivatives is the affine projection (AP) algorithm [38] that speeds up convergence when compared to its simpler gradient counterpart by taking P past regression directions into account. A fast version of this [39, 40] {{is the basis for}} millions of copies of such algorithms running today in electric echo <b>cancellation</b> <b>devices</b> to reduce the echoes of long-distance call telephone cables. Unlike the original algorithm, they use a sophisticated step-size control to prevent instable behavior in double-talk situations [41], that is when both talkers are active. The resulting algorithm is called pseudo affine projection (PAP) algorithm, see Algorithm 8, as with a moderate step-size the original property is lost. Recently, it has been shown [42] that depending on the correlation of the input signal, such PAP algorithm can become unstable and that, depending on the input signal statistic, situations exist in which even small step-sizes do not result in stable behavior but larger ones are required; thus depending on the steady-state of the predictor coefficients a [...]...|$|R

40|$|Human Tremor is an unintentional bodily {{motion that}} affects muscle control among both healthy {{individuals}} {{and those with}} movement disorders, occasionally to severe detriment. While assistive devices avoid the risk of side effects from pharmacological or surgical treatments, most devices are impractical for daily use due to limitations inherent in conventional actuators. The goal {{of this research is}} to address these limitations by developing an antagonistic Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuation technology, enabling a new class of active tremor <b>cancellation</b> <b>devices.</b> This is accomplished through the construction of a model and body of empirical support that provides the necessary design insight and predictive power for an antagonistic actuator that ensures stable amplitude and high frequency motion with low power draw. Actuation frequency and power draw were improved while balancing their competing effects through the development of: 1) a method that accurately measures the convective coefficient of SMA to enhance actuator design, 2) a growth process for carbon nanotube cooling fins to enhance cooling in a fixed medium, and 3) an understanding of the antagonistic architecture to produce increased frequency in a controllable manner. To enable applications requiring predictability for positioning and complex control, a thermodynamic model for antagonistic SMA was derived to account for inertial, slack, boiling, friction, and convective effects. Using the model, a series of simulation studies provided design insight on the effect of operating environment, driving signal, and environmental conditions so that the generic actuation system can be utilized {{in a wide variety of}} applications beyond tremor cancellation. If high forces are required in such applications, stability issues can arise, which were addressed in experimental shakedown research that broadens the high-stress SMA design space. The technology enabled by this dissertation was demonstrated in a working Active Cancellation of Tremor (ACT) prototype that produced 71 % RMS cancellation of human tremor. The cancellation results show significant improvement over the current state of the art by providing intuitive, lightweight, compact hand-held tremor cancellation that is a promising solution to numerous assistive applications in medical, military, and manufacturing sectors...|$|R

40|$|Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), which {{converts}} {{the ambient}} mechanical energy to electricity by friction, {{is one of}} the most promising methods for powering up portable devices. Despite of the successful development so far, there still remain some issues to be improved.

40|$|Abstract This {{research}} on military aviation noise was conducted because the personnel working with military aircraft {{were concerned about}} noise induced hearing damage. In addition, comprehensive data on hearing impairments and occupational exposure of military pilots in the Finnish Air Force was not available. Moreover, data {{on the effects of}} overflight noise of military jets was necessary for the evaluation of noise induced hearing deteriorations of members of the public who might be exposured accidentally for the low-level jets' overflights. The averaged noise exposure levels of pilots varied during a flight from 97 dB(A) to 106 dB(A) in the cockpit and from 83 dB(A) to 100 dB(A) at the entrance of the ear canal. Radio noise was 4 â€“ 10 dB higher than background noise inside the helmet. The attenuation provided by air crew helmets varied from 10 to 21 dB(A) in the laboratory, and was at the same level during real flights. The attenuation measured in the laboratory and in working conditions was about 30 dB(A) for earmuffs. An active noise <b>cancellation</b> (ANC) <b>device</b> decreased averaged noise exposure (LAeq 8 min) 4 â€“ 8 dB over the noise attenuation of the same helmets when the ANC system was off. The noise of overflights by military jets were measured and the noise levels were lower than those known to cause the permanent threshold shifts. However, noise induced hearing damages might be possible in certain conditions. In order to assess the hearing loss risk of pilots, hearing thresholds were measured before and after one flight using both conventional and extended high frequency (EHF) audiometry. Minor temporary threshold shifts (TTS) were revealed. The risk of noise-induced damage at the studied exposure levels is, in all probability, rather small. A novel NoiseScan data management system proved to be an interesting tool in assessment of the risk of developing hearing impairment on the basis of known risk factors. Due to the small number of risk factors, the hearing of pilots was shown to be at considerably less risk than that of industrial workers in Finland...|$|R

To overcome the limitation {{imposed by the}} low efficiency of spin injection and extraction and strict requirements for retention of spin polarization within the semiconductor, novel device structures with additional logic functionality and optimized device performance have been developed. Weak localization/antilocalization measurements and analysis are {{used to assess the}} influence of surface treatments on elastic, inelastic and spin-orbit scatterings during the electron transport within the two-dimensional electron layer at the InAs surface. Furthermore, we have used spin- valve and scanned probe microscopy measurements to investigate the influence of sulfur-based surface treatments and electrically insulating barrier layers on spin injection into, and spin transport within, the two- dimensional electron layer at the surface of p-type InAs. We also demonstrate and analyze a three-terminal, all- electrical spintronic switching device, combining charge current <b>cancellation</b> by appropriate <b>device</b> biasing and ballistic electron transport. The device yields a robust, electrically amplified spin-dependent current signal despite modest efficiency in electrical injection of spin- polarized electrons. Detailed analyses provide insight into the advantages of ballistic, as opposed to diffusive, transport in device operation, as well as scalability to smaller dimensions, and allow us to eliminate the possibility of phenomena unrelated to spin transport contributing to the observed device functionality. The influence of the device geometry on magnetoresistance of nanoscale spin-valve structures is also demonstrated and discussed. Shortcomings of the simplified one-dimensional spin diffusion model for spin valve are elucidated, with comparison of the thickness and the spin diffusion length in the nonmagnetic channel as the criterion for validity of the 1 D model.

40|$|The PhD Thesis "Analysis {{and design}} of {{scattering}} <b>cancellation</b> based cloaking <b>devices</b> operating at microwave and optical frequencies" has been developed as a commented collection of the main research results that I achieved during my PhD. The Thesis is organized in four chapters, corresponding to as many research areas, all related to the macro-topic focused on the design and the applications of the metamaterials and metasurfaces at microwave, infrared and optical frequencies. Chapter 1 {{is focused on the}} theoretical basis of the mantle cloaking at microwave frequencies. The main innovative results achieved in this context are: 1) the definition of a general procedure to design anisotropic mantle cloaks operating, at the same frequency, for both TM and TE incident polarizations. In particular, starting from the analytical model of metasurfaces available in the literature, I have first explored the potentials and limitations of the most common metasurface geometries for their application as mantle cloaks. Then, I have introduced new types of patterned surfaces aimed at improving their polarization response. It has been demonstrated that, only by using four metasurface topologies, it is possible to obtain all the required combinations of positive and negative reactance values in order to design effective mantle cloaks for planar, cylindrical and 3 D objects; 2) The study of the interesting features of multilayered mantle cloaking devices, including, for instance, significant broadband and/or dual-band scattering reduction. Chapter 2 focus on the application of the cloaking technologies both in the transmitting and the in receiving operation mode of antenna systems. My results in this field can be summarized as follows: 1) definition of new-conception optimized receiving sensors with the desired level of absorption efficiency, being able to minimize the electrical presence of a receiving antenna for a chosen level of overall absorption; 2) use of the mantle cloaking to overcome the blockage effect affecting the over-crowed communication platforms, both for passive obstacle (e. g., the support structure of the platforms) and among different antennas; 3) definition of a procedure to design new-conception linear antennas and arrays specifically designed to properly work in a frequencies range and to be electromagnetically invisible in another one. These radiative systems provide a new degree of freedom in the design of modern communication platforms hosting an increasing number of radiators. In fact, the possibility to use invisible antenna systems that can be successfully placed in close proximity will allow to reduce both the space occupancy and the weight of the civil and military platforms as well as on of the satellite systems. Chapter 3 dealt with the topic of optical cloaking. The following results has been obtained: 1) possible implementation of optical epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterials based on the employment of an array of core-shell nano-spheres embedded in a dielectric medium. The core of the nano-spheres and the host medium are both made of silica whereas the shell is formed by a plasmonic material (i. e., silver). Using classical homogenization formulas, I show {{that it is possible to}} design the array in such a way to exhibit near-zero values of the effective real permittivity with relatively low-losses in the upper part of the optical spectrum; 2) investigation of the application of the mantle cloaking technique to near-infrared and visible frequencies, using thin covers consisting of 2 D arrays of plasmonic non-spherical nanoparticles. Here, I focused in more detail in the plasmonic nanoparticles modeling and I generalized the literature results to demonstrate that the nanoparticles arrays can be characterized by a suitable average surface reactance. Then, I show that the use of two-dimensional model is more appropriate than the one based on the effective permittivity. This analysis has allowed to extend the metasurfaces-based cloaking up to optical frequencies and to engineer the shape of the plasmonic nanoparticles in order to dramatically improve the performance of the optical cloaking devices previously proposed. Finally, Chapter 4 collects my results in other research fields: 1) investigation of the use of non-Foster active circuits to increase the operation bandwidth of a split-ring resonator (SRR) for possible application in metamaterial-inspired components, In particular, I propose a possible realistic implementation of the active load, based on the employment of commercially available circuit elements. The obtained results (seven times improvement of the impedance bandwidth of the SRR-based monopole antenna) prove that non-Foster active loads can be successfully used to overcome the inherent narrow-band operation of SRR-based passive metamaterials and metamaterial-inspired components.; 2) definition of a simple and low-cost technique for realizing resistive 3 sheets. This approach, requiring only easy-to-find and inexpensive materials, consists in the deposition of graphite powder on ultrathin plastic sheet substrates. I show that, by controlling the deposition time and the mass of the deposited powder, it is possible to realize resistive sheets exhibiting a desired surface resistance in a wide range of values. All Chapters are preceded by a short introduction describing my publications related to that specific topic and summarizing the content of the various Section. In each Section, I have reported the state-of-the-art about the topic and my main findings, that are supported by a combination of theoretical, numerical, and, where available, experimental results...|$|R
