40|$|A {{patient is}} {{presented}} with a cervical spinal cord transection which occurred after a motor vehicle accident in which the air bag deployed and the seat belt was not in use. The patient had complete quadriplegia below the C 5 level and his imaging study showed cervical cord transection {{at the level of}} the C 5 / 6 disc space with C 5, C 6 vertebral bodies and laminar fractures. He underwent a C 5 laminectomy and a C 4 - 7 posterior fusion with lateral mass screw fixation. Previous reports have described <b>central</b> <b>cord</b> <b>syndromes</b> occurring in hyperextension injuries, but in adults, acute spinal cord transections have only developed after fracture-dislocations of the spine. A case involving a post-traumatic spinal cord transection without any evidence of radiologic facet dislocations is reported. Also, we propose a combined hyperflexion-hyperextension mechanism to explain this type of injury...|$|R
500|$|Spinal cord {{injuries}} generally {{result in}} at least some incurable impairment even with the best possible treatment. The best predictor of prognosis is the level and completeness of injury, as measured by the ASIA impairment scale. The neurological score at the initial evaluation done 72 hours after injury is the best predictor of how much function will return. Most people with ASIA scores of A (complete injuries) do not have functional motor recovery, but improvement can occur. Most patients with incomplete injuries recover at least some function. Chances of recovering the ability to walk improve with each AIS grade found at the initial examination; e.g. an ASIA D score confers a better chance of walking than a score of C. The symptoms of incomplete injuries can vary {{and it is difficult to}} make an accurate prediction of the outcome. [...] A person with a mild, incomplete injury at the T5 vertebra will have a much better chance of using his or her legs than a person with a severe, complete injury at exactly the same place. Of the incomplete SCI <b>syndromes,</b> Brown-Séquard and <b>central</b> <b>cord</b> <b>syndromes</b> have the best prognosis for recovery and anterior <b>cord</b> <b>syndrome</b> has the worst.|$|R

Following laminectomy for cervical radiculomyelopathy four patients were unchanged neurologically from their pre-operative examinations, but as they were raised into the upright position for the first time following surgery focal neurological deficits referrable to the spinal cord developed. Hypotension was present in all four cases during these episodes and three of the four patients had residual <b>central</b> cervical <b>cord</b> <b>syndromes.</b> These cases represent the first reported instances of spinal cord ischaemia occurring with post-operative hypotensive episodes after decompression for cervical spondylosis...|$|R

50|$|<b>Central</b> <b>cord</b> <b>syndrome</b> (CCS) is {{the most}} common form of {{cervical}} spinal cord injury. It is characterized by loss of motion and sensation in arms and hands. It usually results from trauma which causes damage to the neck, leading to major injury to the central grey matter of the spinal cord. The syndrome is more common in people over the age of 50 because osteoarthritis in the neck region causes weakening of the vertebrae. CCS most frequently occurs among older persons with cervical spondylosis, however, it also may occur in younger individuals.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms usually begin insidiously between {{adolescence}} and age 45. Syringomyelia develops {{in the center}} of the spinal cord, causing a <b>central</b> <b>cord</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Pain and temperature sensory deficits occur early but may not be recognized for years. The first abnormality recognized may be a painless burn or cut. Syringomyelia typically causes weakness, atrophy, and often fasciculations and hyporeflexia of the hands and arms; a deficit in pain and temperature sensation in a capelike distribution over the shoulders, arms and back is characteristic. Light touch and position and vibration sensation are not affected. Later, spastic leg weakness develops. Deficits may be asymmetric.|$|E

5000|$|An {{individual}} with a {{spinal cord injury}} may have many goals for outpatient occupational and physiotherapy. Their level of independence, self-care, and mobility are dependent on their degree of neurological impairment. Rehabilitation organization and outcomes are also based on these impairments. The physiatrist, along with the rehabilitation team, work with the patient to develop specific, measurable, action-oriented, realistic, and time-centered goals. With respect to physical therapy interventions, it has been determined that repetitive task-specific sensory input can improve motor output in patients with <b>central</b> <b>cord</b> <b>syndrome.</b> These activities enable the spinal cord to incorporate both supraspinal and afferent sensory information to help recover motor output.

40|$|Objective: To develop {{recommendations}} on {{the timing of}} surgical decompression in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) and <b>central</b> <b>cord</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Methods: A systematic {{review of the literature}} was conducted to address key relevant questions. A multidisciplinary guideline development group used this information, along with their clinical expertise, to develop recommendations for the timing of surgical decompression in patients with SCI and <b>central</b> <b>cord</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Based on GRADE, a strong recommendation is worded as “we recommend,” whereas a weak recommendation is presented as “we suggest. ” Results: Conclusions from the systematic review included (1) isolated studies reported statistically significant and clinically important improvements following early decompression at 6 months and following discharge from inpatient rehabilitation; (2) in one study on acute <b>central</b> <b>cord</b> <b>syndrome</b> without instability, a marginally significant improvement in total motor scores was reported at 6 and 12 months in patients managed with early versus late surgery; and (3) {{there were no significant differences}} in length of acute care/rehabilitation stay or in rates of complications between treatment groups. Our recommendations were: “We suggest that early surgery be considered as a treatment option in adult patients with traumatic central cord syndrome” and “We suggest that early surgery be offered as an option for adult acute SCI patients regardless of level. ” Quality of evidence for both recommendations was considered low. Conclusions: These guidelines should be implemented into clinical practice to improve outcomes in patients with acute SCI and <b>central</b> <b>cord</b> <b>syndrome</b> by promoting standardization of care, decreasing the heterogeneity of management strategies, and encouraging clinicians to make evidence-informed decisions. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017...|$|E
40|$|<b>Central</b> <b>cord</b> <b>syndrome</b> is an {{incomplete}} {{spinal cord injury}} first described by Schneider et al. (J Neurosurg 11 : 546 – 547, 1954). The typical neurological deficit is symmetrical incomplete quadriplegia affecting the upper more than the lower limbs; sensory impairment is variable and urinary retention is common. Records of all patients with acute traumatic <b>central</b> <b>cord</b> <b>syndrome</b> admitted to the National Spinal Injuries Unit from 1999 to 2007 were compiled from a prospectively collected computerized spinal database. Data recorded included patient demographic profile, mechanism of injury, initial neurological deficit, treatment instituted, complications of treatment, and final neurological status.

40|$|<b>Central</b> <b>cord</b> <b>syndrome</b> (CCS) is {{extremely}} rare {{as a direct}} consequence of generalized epileptic seizure. CCS is associated with hyperextension of the spinal cord and has characteristic radiologic findings including posterior ligamentous injury and prevertebral hyperintensity following magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We experienced the case of a 25 -year-old man who suffered CCS after status epilepticus. Cervical spinal MRI revealed high signal intensity at the C 1 level but with no signal or structural changes in other sites. After rehabilitation management, the patient significantly improved on the ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) motor scale and bladder function. We proposed that epilepsy related CCS may be caused by muscle contractions during generalized seizure, which can induce traction injury of the spinal cord or relative narrowing of spinal canal via transient herniated nucleus pulposus or transient subluxation of vertebra.
