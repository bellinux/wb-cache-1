40|$|Several {{states have}} enacted {{statutes}} to protect minors from harmful or obscene materials disseminated over the Internet, {{as well as}} from pedophiles seeking to use the Internet to lure them into sexual conduct. State and federal <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> diverged in their analysis of the Dormant Commerce Clause 2 ̆ 7 s impact on state regulation in these areas. While state <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> held that the Dormant Commerce Clause does not invalidate state luring statutes, federal <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> been consistent in finding state dissemination statutes unconstitutional. This iBrief summarizes recent state and federal jurisprudence in this area and concludes that state <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> not been successful in distinguishing state luring statutes from federal case law on state dissemination statutes. Therefore, state <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> prematurely aborted the Dormant Commerce Clause examination...|$|R
5|$|But, the {{defendant}} {{does not have}} a right to a jury in stacked misdemeanor prosecutions, even if the cumulative authorized imprisonment exceeds six months, as long as the actual sentence does not. Factors other than actual and authorized sentences may be relevant to seriousness, but so far the <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> pushed back against expanding the jury right.|$|E
5|$|However, not {{all cases}} were victories; ACLU lost cases in 1949 and 1961 which {{challenged}} state laws requiring commercial businesses to close on Sunday, the Christian Sabbath. The Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> never overturned such laws, although some states subsequently revoked {{many of the}} laws under pressure from commercial interests.|$|E
5|$|If the High Court {{refuses to}} hear an appeal, the case cannot proceed further; similarly, with one exception, once the High <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> heard a case, no {{decision}} may be reviewed by the Court of Appeal. The one exception is laid out in Section 1(7), and provides that leave to appeal is only valid if either the High Court or Court of Appeal certifies it as such, and the High Court confirms that the case concerns a point of law which merits consideration. In National Westminster Bank Plc v Arthur Young McClelland Moores & Co (No.1), the Court of Appeal confirmed that, once the High <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> decided not to allow an appeal, the registrar of the Court of Appeal cannot intervene and otherwise validate such a request.|$|E
5|$|Federal appeals <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> {{been divided}} {{on whether the}} Hazelwood case applies to college newspapers, a {{question}} the Supreme Court left open. <b>Courts</b> <b>have</b> also been split on viewpoint-based expression in schools, such as religious expression.|$|R

5|$|In {{the case}} of Powell v. Alabama in 1932, the United States Supreme Court held that the court must provide counsel to {{defendants}} in capital trials, that is trials where capital punishment was a possible sentence, if the defendants were too poor to afford their own counsel. In Johnson v. Zerbst (1938), the Supreme Court expanded this principle to cover all federal trials, and in Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) the Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, the principle also applied to State courts. More recently, the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> recognised the right of people to have counsel at other stages of criminal investigations. For example, the <b>court</b> <b>has</b> affirmed the right of indigent defendants to have counsel provided for them in interrogation {{after they have been}} arrested (Miranda v. Arizona), and for line-ups (United States v. Wade).|$|E

In consequence, and relying on prevailing values of public policy, new grounds of unworthiness may arise in the future.

5|$|The Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> {{determined}} that the First Amendment also protects citizens from being compelled to say or pay for certain speech.

5|$|The Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> {{eventually}} adopted {{some elements}} of Harlan's approach, holding that only some Bill of Rights guarantees were applicable against the states—the doctrine known as selective incorporation. However, under Chief Justice Earl Warren during the 1960s, {{an increasing number of}} rights were deemed sufficiently fundamental for incorporation (Harlan regularly dissented from these rulings). Hence, the majority of provisions from the Bill of Rights have been extended to the states; the exceptions are the Third Amendment, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Seventh Amendment, the excessive bail provision of the Eighth Amendment, the Ninth Amendment, and the Tenth Amendment. Thus, although the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> agreed with Harlan's general reasoning, the end result of its jurisprudence is very different from what Harlan advocated.|$|E
