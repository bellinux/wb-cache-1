50|$|The goal of <b>crew</b> <b>planning</b> {{optimization}} is {{to solve}} {{for the best}} solution at the lowest cost to the airline. In other words, airlines would like to increase their productivity while minimizing crew costs and improving, as much as possible, crew quality of life. In order to plan their monthly schedules, airlines must consider operational limits, including but not limited to: country requirements, airport regulations, union rules and collective agreements. Before the era of technology, this process was completed by hand {{by a team of}} crew planners. Often they just attempted to make all their flights fit with the number of employees that were available. <b>Crew</b> <b>planning</b> optimization was then implemented to take all of the limits and some of the crew preferences into account. Using Operations Research (OR) to develop mathematical tools, the optimizers build highly cost-efficient pairings and then assign these pairings in an efficient manner to the crew members (both in the cabin and cockpit). This technological advancement has proven to be an important cost-reducing tool for airlines and has significantly improved crew quality of life.|$|E

5000|$|The {{process of}} {{requesting}} a certain schedule is called [...] "bidding". Generally {{this is done}} on a monthly basis.

In the United States, crew members are often working under a union's collective bargaining agreement, and sometimes including non-union workplaces, seniority is used to give senior crew member the right to override junior crew member requests.

5000|$|The {{first phase}} in <b>crew</b> <b>planning</b> is {{building}} the crew pairings (also known as trips, rotations, among other popular descriptions). This process pairs a generic crew member with a flight {{so that at}} the end of this process all aircraft flights are covered and all trips (combination of flights starting at a crew base and returning to that crew base or co-terminal are crew legal. The next step is the allocation of those trips to the individual crewmember. For the US, Canada and Australia, seniority generally rules. The two processes (which are completely different) are referred to as bid lines and preferential bidding. In seniority order, pilots bid for either a line of time (bidline) or trips and days off (preferential bidding. these are awarded based on seniority and modified only when their selections have already been taken by a more senior crew member (bidlines) or their trip and day off selections (preferential bidding) do not make up a complete line (hours, days off, etc. parameters agreed to by the company and the union). The senior folks have more time off, better choice of time off and fly better trips than the junior crew members, generally speaking. In the US, this is considered fair. For European airlines and other airlines in the rest of the world, the allocation process is completely different. The company builds the pilot schedules directly to meet their needs, not the pilot's needs. Before assigning a single trip, the schedulers put all planned absences (vacation, training, etc.) onto the crew members' schedule. Only then are trips assigned to the individual crew members. As such, fairness means that the most senior captain and the most junior captain have the same amount of duty time, block hours, night time, time away from base, layovers, expense pay, etc. in a given schedule period. Seniority is out and all work is completely homogenized. For them, anything else is unfair, undemocratic. Slowly over the last thirty years, foreign airlines using the [...] "no seniority" [...] rostering system have allowed some measure of seniority to creep into the allocation process from pilots who may now ask for a specific day off or trip once a quarter or make multiple requests within a schedule period. Although this may sound very much like preferential bidding, it is not. The disparity between junior and senior crew members is still very limited and thus achievement of your choices is limited.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a decision}} support system for airline and railway <b>crew</b> <b>planning.</b> The system is a state-of-the-art branch-and-price solver that is used for crew scheduling and crew rostering. We briefly discuss the mathematical background of the solver, of which most part is covered in the Operations Research literature. Crew scheduling is <b>crew</b> <b>planning</b> for {{one or a few}} days that results in crew duties or pairings, and crew rostering is <b>crew</b> <b>planning</b> for at least one week for individual crew members. Technical issues about the system and its implementation are covered in more detail, as well as several applications. In particular, we focus on a specific aircrew rostering application. The computational results contain an interesting comparison of results obtained with, on one hand, the approach in which crew scheduling is carried out before crew rostering, and, on the other hand, an approach in which these two planning problems are solved in an integrated manner. {{decision support system}}s;branch and bound;crew planning...|$|E
