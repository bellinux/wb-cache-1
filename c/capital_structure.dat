This technique relies on the fact that a company's stock price and its CDS spread should exhibit negative correlation; i.e., if the outlook for a company improves then its share price should go up and its CDS spread should tighten, since it is less likely to default on its debt. However, if its outlook worsens then its CDS spread should widen and its stock price should fall.|$|E

25|$|Corporate {{bankruptcy}} {{can arise}} {{as a result}} of two broad categories failure—business failure or financial distress. Business failure stems from a critical flaw in the company's business model that prohibits it from producing the necessary level of profit to justify its capital investment. Conversely, financial distress stems from a critical flaw in the way the company is financed, or its <b>capital</b> <b>structure.</b> Continued financial distress leads to either technical insolvency (assets outweigh liabilities, but the firm is unable to meet current obligations) or “bankruptcy” (liabilities outweigh assets, and the firm has a negative net worth). A company experiencing business failure can stay off bankruptcy as long as it has access to funding; conversely, a company that experiencing financial failure will be pushed into bankruptcy regardless of the soundness of its business model. The actual causes of corporate bankruptcies are difficult to establish, due to the compounding effects of external (macroeconomic, industry) and internal (business or financial) factors. However, some studies have indicated that financial leverage and working capital mismanagement are likely two of the major causes of corporate failure and bankruptcy in the U.S.|$|E

Liquidation values depend on how many firms are liquidated, and therefore on the industry equilibrium of <b>capital</b> <b>structures</b> and of technology choices. We show that firms using a technology with high liquidation value issue less debt than those with low liquidation value even if these ones may be inefficiently liquidated. With respect to the equilibrium in the industry, we obtain that even if in equilibrium all firms use the same technology, firms will use widely different <b>capital</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Much of {{the theory}} here, falls under the {{umbrella}} of the Trade-Off Theory in which firms are assumed to trade-off the tax benefits of debt with the bankruptcy costs of debt when choosing how to allocate the company's resources. However economists have developed a set of alternative theories about how managers allocate a corporation's finances. One of the main alternative theories of how firms manage their capital funds is the Pecking Order Theory (Stewart Myers), which suggests that firms avoid external financing while they have internal financing available and avoid new equity financing while they can engage in new debt financing at reasonably low interest rates. [...] Also, <b>Capital</b> <b>structure</b> substitution theory hypothesizes that management manipulates the <b>capital</b> <b>structure</b> such that earnings per share (EPS) are maximized. An emerging area in finance theory is right-financing whereby investment banks and corporations can enhance investment return and company value over time by determining the right investment objectives, policy framework, institutional structure, source of financing (debt or equity) and expenditure framework within a given economy and under given market conditions. One of the more recent innovations in this area from a theoretical point of view is the Market timing hypothesis. This hypothesis, inspired in the behavioral finance literature, states that firms look for the cheaper type of financing regardless of their current levels of internal resources, debt and equity.|$|E
