5|$|Almost every {{sizeable}} body {{of water}} in Scotland has an associated kelpie story, but the most extensively reported is that of Loch Ness. Parallels to the general Germanic neck and the Scandinavian bäckahäst have been observed. More widely, the wihwin of Central America and the Australian bunyip {{have been seen as}} counterparts. The origin of the belief in malevolent water horses has been proposed as originating in human sacrifices once made to appease gods associated with water, but narratives about the kelpie also served a practical purpose in keeping <b>children</b> <b>away</b> from dangerous stretches of water, and warning young women to be wary of handsome strangers.|$|E
5|$|Folklorist Gary R. Varner has {{suggested}} that the origin of the belief in water horses that preyed on and devoured humans may be a reflection of the human sacrifices once made to appease the gods of water. The association with horses may have its roots in horse sacrifices performed in ancient Scandinavia. Stories of malevolent water spirits served the practical purpose of keeping <b>children</b> <b>away</b> from perilous areas of water, and of warning adolescent women to be wary of attractive young strangers. The stories were also used to enforce moral standards, as they implied that the creatures took retribution for bad behaviour carried out on Sundays. The intervention of demons and spirits was possibly a way to rationalise the drowning of children and adults who had accidentally fallen into deep, fast flowing or turbulent water.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Wombosi {{continues}} to obsess over the attempt on his life. Conklin, having anticipated this, planted {{a body in}} the Paris morgue to appear as the assailant, but Wombosi is not fooled and threatens to report this and other CIA secrets to the media. The Professor assassinates Wombosi on Conklin's orders. Bourne, posing as Kane, learns about Wombosi's yacht, and that the assailant had been shot twice in the back during the escape; he realizes {{that he was the}} assailant. He and Marie take refuge at the French countryside home of her old friend Eamon (Tim Dutton) and his children. Under pressure from Abbott to tie off the Wombosi matter entirely, Conklin tracks Bourne's location and sends the Professor there, but Bourne shoots him twice with Eamon's shotgun, mortally wounding him. The Professor reveals their shared connection to Treadstone before dying. Bourne sends Marie, Eamon, and Eamon's <b>children</b> <b>away</b> for their protection, and then contacts Conklin via the Professor's phone to arrange a meeting. From a rooftop near the arranged location in Paris, Bourne sees Conklin has brought backup, so he abandons the meeting, but uses the opportunity to place a tracking device on Conklin's car, leading Bourne to Treadstone's safe house.|$|E

25|$|In 1980 Swedish naturalist {{and author}} Bengt Sjögren wrote that present beliefs in lake monsters {{such as the}} Loch Ness Monster are {{associated}} with kelpie legends.

Sjögren wrote that the kelpie legends have developed into descriptions reflecting a modern awareness of plesiosaurs.|$|E

25|$|In Canada, Native {{children}} in the isolated Northern Labrador community of Davis Inlet were the focus of national concern in 1993, when many {{were found to be}} sniffing gasoline. The Canadian and provincial Newfoundland and Labrador governments intervened on a number of occasions, sending many <b>children</b> <b>away</b> for treatment. Despite being moved to the new community of Natuashish in 2002, serious inhalant abuse problems have continued. Similar problems were reported in Sheshatshiu in 2000 and also in Pikangikum First Nation. In 2012, the issue once again made the news media in Canada.|$|E

25|$|In March 1778, Ann {{died of an}} illness, {{possibly}} pneumonia, at Penrith. After {{the death}} of his mother in 1778, his father was inconsolable and sent his <b>children</b> <b>away</b> to be raised by their relatives. William was taken in by his mother's family and eventually sent to Hawkshead Grammar School, and Dorothy was sent to live with Elizabeth Threlkeld, Ann's cousin, in Halifax. She and William did not meet again for another nine years. Although Hawkshead was Wordsworth's first serious experience with education, he was taught to read by his mother and attended a tiny school in Cockermouth of low quality.|$|E
25|$|On July 18, 1855, Johnson passed word {{to a black}} porter in Bloodgood's Hotel, where Wheeler {{had locked}} her in with her children, {{that she wanted to}} escape her master's custody. He got word to William Still, {{chairman}} of the Vigilance Committee of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, who helped fugitive slaves. Later that day, as the full Wheeler party prepared to board the ferry, Still and abolitionist Passmore Williamson, secretary of the Society, reached the docks. Williamson told Johnson that she could choose freedom according to Pennsylvania law. While Wheeler argued, offered her a promise of freedom, and tried to prevent Johnson from leaving, five black dockworkers restrained him, and Williamson explained the state law to him. William Still quickly escorted Johnson and her <b>children</b> <b>away</b> by a coach, later taking them secretly to his house. He never told Williamson where they were, under the principles of compartmentalization used by the Vigilance Committee.|$|E
25|$|Luther Standing Bear {{left the}} Pine Ridge Reservation to attend Carlisle. His father celebrated his son's brave act by {{inviting}} {{his friends to}} a gathering and gave away seven horses and all the goods in his dry goods store. Luther became a school recruiter for Captain Pratt and periodically visited reservations. He demonstrated what the students had learned and persuaded parents {{to send their children}} to Carlisle by his appearance, language and skills; however, many children died from infectious diseases in boarding schools and parents were fearful to let them go. Moreover, many parents were treated unfairly and had not been notified until after the children died and were buried. Unscrupulous Indian agents failed to mail letters from Carlisle to the parents, until the parents came into the agency for something. While many parents were proud of Luther, they were afraid to send their <b>children</b> <b>away</b> fearing they would never see them again.|$|E

25|$|The two craft {{were brought}} down to Langstone Harbour for {{competitive}} trials. On its trials on a misty morning, {{the noise from}} the two 120hp Chryslers in the Birmabright alloy hull scared some mothers who hurried their <b>children</b> <b>away</b> from the Isle of Wight beaches as the craft came inshore. The conclusions of the trial left no one in doubt. A platoon of Royal Marines disembarked from the Fleming craft in {{a quarter of the}} time taken by the platoon in the Thornycroft, the silhouette of the Fleming craft was less, it created less disturbance when steaming, and it beached better. But, and this was later the deciding factor, the Birmabright craft was so noisy that it meant sacrificing tactical surprise, while it was impossible to mount armour on its sides. The failings of the Thornycroft craft on the other hand could all be overcome. A second prototype from Thornycroft had a double-diagonal mahogany hull with twin engines and those features — low silhouette, quiet engines, little bow wave — which appealed to the Centre's staff in their search for a craft that could make surprise landings. The craft beached satisfactorily, a quality retained in all LCA designs, but the troops took too long to disembark across this prototype's narrow ramp. Armour could easily take the place of the outer mahogany planking, the exit could be lowered, the silhouette could be cut down and the engines could be so silenced {{that they would not be}} heard at twenty-five yards. So although the Fleming boat won at the trial, it was the Thornycroft design, duly altered, that became the assault landing craft. A third prototype — ALC No 2 — was therefore built after the DNC had worked with Thornycroft on modifications to the design.|$|E
