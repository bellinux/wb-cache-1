50|$|The {{gamma ray}} log is a {{measurement}} of naturally occurring gamma {{radiation from the}} borehole walls. Sandstones are usually nonradioactive quartz and limestones are nonradioactive calcite. Shales however, are naturally radioactive due to potassium isotopes in clays, and adsorbed uranium and thorium. Thus {{the presence or absence}} of gamma rays in a borehole is an indication of the amount of shale or clay in the surrounding formation. The gamma ray log is useful in holes drilled with air or with oil based muds, as these wells have no SP voltage. Even in water-based muds, the gamma ray and SP logs are often run together. They comprise a check on each other and can indicate unusual shale sections which may either not be radioactive, or may have an abnormal ionic chemistry. The gamma ray log is also useful to detect coal beds, which, depending on the local geology, can have either low radiation levels, or high radiation levels due to adsorption of uranium. In addition, the gamma ray log will work inside a steel casing, making it essential when a <b>cased</b> <b>well</b> must be evaluated.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{operation}} of drilling well leads to casing wear {{to some degree}} in <b>cased</b> <b>well.</b> The reduced strength of worn casing threats {{to the safety of}} well test and completion. In order to calculate casing wear depth and prevent the casing wear, the wear efficiency and friction coefficient is measured in the different wear time, the contact force and the rotating speed. The wear efficiency increases with the contact force and the rotating speed. And the bigger the rotating speed, the bigger the friction coefficient. The wear efficiency of P 110 casing is change from 2 to 8 × 10 - 13 1 /Pa. The rotating speed has less influence on the wear efficient. So it is reasonable that the wear efficiency model is adopted to calculate the wear degree of P 110 casing...|$|E

"The HGP-A well was temporarily plugged in December 1994 {{in a manner}} that allowed the <b>cased</b> <b>well</b> bore to be used while preventing geothermal fluids from reaching surface. Now the decision has been made to plug and abandon the well. In order to meet the DLNR regulations for well abandonment, the temporary plug should be removed from the well bore. Then the well bore through the geothermal producing zones can be plugged. Any attempt to do so in 1994 would have been premature, as plugging through the producing zones would have rendered the well useless for any further scientific work in the productive interval. The existing plug should be removed so that the well bore can be plugged through the producing zones. The casing above the geothermal zones will also have to be plugged to complete the abandonment.

40|$|Understanding and {{predicting}} {{the effects of}} surface roughness on ultrasonic pulse-echo measurements is important {{in a variety of}} applications. In particular, it is of interest for <b>cased</b> <b>well</b> evaluation in the oilfield industry where the measurement is used to investigate the cement seal placed between the casing and the formation wall (see Fig. 1 (a)) [1]. Here, the acoustic transducer signal arises from multiple reflections taking place at the various interfaces of the layered (borehole fluid) -(steel casing) -cement-(rocky formation) structure. Previous numerical models, developed to account for this measurement, have been limited to canonical configurations where, in particular, the various interfaces are smooth [2]. Typically, the cement-formation interface is rough with widely varying rms height and correlation length. In order to predict the effect of roughness of arbitrary sizeon the reflection echo attributed to this interface, a frequency-domain hybrid analytical/numerical simulation model has been developed. The model has been preliminary implemented for a two-dimensional (2 D) configuration where an acoustic transducer with a Gaussian profile interacts with the aforementioned structure in a planar geometry (see Fig. 1 (b)). In this configuration, the transducer aperture has a finite size in the (x, z) and is infinite in the y direction. The fluid, steel layer, cement layer, and halfspace formation are assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous. The cement-formation interface, denoted by S 0, is in general irregular or rough and parameterized by the function z = h(x) describing the height of a particle on S 0 measured from the (mean) plane z = 0.

40|$|As {{the number}} of aging oil field in the North Sea is increasing, {{the number of}} plug and {{abandonment}} (P&A) jobs which has to be conducted on the wells going out of production, e. g. to prevent hydrocarbons from leaking out of the reservoirs, are increasing with it. In the planning of a P&A job, the bonding and hydraulic isolation properties of the sealing material in a <b>cased</b> <b>well</b> must be logged. In this thesis some of the ultrasonic evaluation tools currently used {{to ensure that a}} well cementing job has been properly executed will be presented together with two of the widely used techniques in ultrasonic logging, in particular the pulse-echo technique and the pitch-catch technique. Even though the ultrasonic pitch-catch technique is widely used in well logging and is commercially available, little research has been done on the use of this technique in an environment with multiple casings. A finite-element simulation model were constructed for a double-casing environment, and a set of ultrasonic measurements were performed to give an experimental verification to the simulation model. The simulations were conducted using COMSOL Multiphysics and the ultrasonic experiments in this thesis were conducted on the Statoil-funded Behind Casing Logging Set-Up (BeCaLoS) developed by SINTEF Petroleum Research, designed to replicate the steel casing setup in an oil well. It was found from the simulations that a train of leaky Lamb wave packets is excited on both casings in the double-casing environment. Through the ultrasonic experiments the excitation of the Lamb wave packet trains on the plate was experimentally verified. Three sets of pitch-catch measurements were conducted by moving the receiver in a grid parallel to the plate to measure the Lamb wave spreading in the plate, each with a different setup for the lower plate. The tilting of the lower plate in the experimental setup, replicating the situation of casing eccentering, could be detected through these sets of pitch-catch measurements...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 This thesis {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} of flow patterns in shallow geothermal wells in Klamath Falls, Oregon, Although wells have been extensively used in the area, {{the exact nature of}} the flows in the wells has not been characterized. Flow characterization is a principal object of this study. Horizontal crossflows of geothermal fluid may occur at upper and/or lower levels in the well where perforations in the well casing are situated. In addition, natural convection may induce vertical flows within the well casing which would be influenced by {{the presence or absence of}} a heat exchanger. Preliminary vertical flow measurements were made with a type of turbinemeter called a "spinner" which was calibrated in a vertical pipe. This type of instrument had limitations in regard to the overall objectives of the study in that (i) the spinner partially blocked flow in the well, possibly altering flow patterns and rates, and (ii) the spinner could not detect or measure horizontal flows. In order to obtain a more satisfactory flow-measuring method, a literature search on flow measurement in confined spaces was undertaken. As a result of the search, a hot-film anemometer was selected to make the detailed flow measurements. The hot-film anemometer was a two-sensor probe that was calibrated in a special calibration system. The high-temperature water in the system was pressurized so that local boiling would not occur at the heated hot-film surface. A number of difficulties occurred with the probe during calibration, possibly due to the severe environment. Measurements of vertical and horizontal flows were attempted on a single <b>cased</b> <b>well</b> with no downhole heat exchanger. A steel cage was built to provide protection for the probe when in the well. Vertical flow measurements showed agreement with past analytical work and also confirmed the effect of spinner flow blockages. Turbulence in the lower perforation region was detected with the vertical flow Measuring channel. Turbulence in the tower perforation region was again detected with the horizontal flow measuring channel. There was difficulty in separating horizontal and vertical flow components. No evidence of high horizontal velocities was found...|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} phase of this project three {{enhanced}} large diameter (> 60 cm) residential wells were constructed at a study site in Lindsay, Ontario. Two wells were constructed using concrete tile casing while the other well was constructed using galvanized steel casing. Javor (2010) evaluated various aspects of drinking water well construction and design to determine the susceptibility of residential large diameter drinking water wells to surface water and airborne contamination. One of the purposes of these new installations was to remove the uncertainty with respect to construction methods, age and maintenance that is characteristic of residential drinking water well performance studies. Javor (2010) conducted a field and laboratory study to assess the performance of several design changes that were thought to improve the integrity of large diameter drinking water wells. These experiments were also used to determine whether one design was more prone to atmospheric and/or surface water contamination than another. During the second phase of this project routine monitoring was continued and data pertinent to assess the performance of the test wells were collected using the same instrumentation. This routine monitoring involved the visual inspection of the wells, collection of well water elevation, collection of soil temperature profile data, collection and analysis of water samples, and collection of cumulative water volumes extracted from the test wells. In addition to the routine monitoring, a ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey was performed in October 2010 to complement the previous data collected during February 2010. Smoke tracer tests were performed under non-frozen and frozen conditions to re-assess the potential pathways of contaminants between the atmosphere and the interior of the test wells. Bacteriological indicators and high concentrations of two dissolved ions were detected in all test and monitoring wells. The smoke tracer tests demonstrated that pathways for airborne contaminants to enter the test wells exist with similar pathways observed in the winter and the summer. GPR surveys indicated that the bentonite slurry annular sealant was the most homogeneous media. A baseline characterization of the microbial nature of the biofilm performed in three of the test wells (CTH 1, ETH 1 and ETH 3) indicated that the sessile bacteria are more metabolically diverse than suspended bacteria, and that this diversity is even higher in the concrete cased wells. Biofilm characterization performed on concrete, fibreglass and galvanized steel coupons incubated in two of the test wells (concrete and galvanized steel) showed that bacteria in the concrete cased wells barely colonized on fiberglass and galvanized steel, while bacteria in the galvanized steel <b>cased</b> <b>well</b> did not have difficulty colonizing on any of the casing materials. The results of the biofilm cleaning study indicated that the use of pressure washing combined with chlorination effectively removed biofilm grown on galvanized steel and fibreglass casing materials. This study investigated various factors that could affect the performance of large diameter drinking water wells. Since the test wells used in this study were under the direct influence of surface water a comparison between the various annular sealants was problematic. However, the three enhanced test wells outperformed the conventional test well. The observations from the smoke tracer tests performed under non-frozen and frozen conditions indicate that the Poly-Lok lid seam is the most prevalent pathway for airborne contaminants to enter a well. Fibreglass may be the preferred choice for large diameter well casing material since fibreglass is corrosion resistant, lightweight, easy to install, has a high strength to weight ratio, and a greater degree of biofilm was able to be removed from fibreglass casing material than from galvanized steel casing material...|$|E
40|$|Geophysical {{investigations}} of subsurface lithologic units in regions of thick, unsaturated, and poorly consolidated sediments {{have always been}} a problem in exploration geophysics. An experimental high-resolution seismic refraction profile and four geoelectric surveys were acquired in a problem area of this nature near Orchard, Idaho. The objective was to test the viability of using these techniques to do detailed subsurface mapping of sedimentary/volcanic interfaces underlying this portion of the western Snake River Plain. Although only standard methods were employed, the refraction and geoelectric surveys produced results which are internally consistent and consistent with information obtained from nearby boreholes. The refraction survey was conducted at a location locally referred to as Orchard Ranch. Eight 24 -channel geophone spreads, with a 5 -m station interval, were used to acquire the data resulting in 920 m of subsurface coverage. A buried explosive energy source was utilized at inline offsets of 100 m and 0 m from both ends of each receiver spread. Data analysis was conducted using two independent processing techniques including the reciprocal method (RM) and a refraction statics software package developed by Green Mountain Geophysical Corporation. The RM technique computes refractor depths as the product of a time-depth and depth conversion factor for every receiver. Refractor depths were computed from north to south with forced depth ties between spreads at stations of overlap. The Green Mountain technique uses a ray theory model of seismic waves in the near surface layers of the earth to estimate layer geometries and velocities. Refractor depths are derived from time-terms computed for each receiver, and time differences between each shot/receiver pair. This method uses constant layer velocities in the computation. The refractor depth models generated from the RM and the Green Mountain analyses reveal very similar features: a slightly irregular refractor surface at depths of 30 - 45 m with an abrupt discontinuity in the vicinity of Station 87. This discontinuity has been interpreted as representing either a down-to-the-south normal fault or a flow edge of a younger basalt overlying a deeper, and older, basalt unit. A second study conducted at the Orchard Ranch site involved the acquisition, processing, and interpretation of resistivity data collected from four separate geoelectric soundings to map stratigraphic boundaries in the subsurface, both laterally and with depth. These included a single point Schlumberger vertical sounding, 20 -m and 60 -m dipole-dipole profiles, and a controlled source audiomagnetotelluric (CSAMT) survey. The first set of resistivity data was acquired using a symmetric expanding Schlumberger electrode configuration running parallel to a seismic refraction line acquired in a previous study (Howarth, 1989, Line 1), and centered about the midpoint (Station 100) between the PVC and the Orchard Ranch wells. One-dimensional inversion of the data using an automatic interpretation program (Zohdy, 1989) resulted in a 16 -layer resistivity model. By imposing constraints based on the available geologic information, an equivalent four-layer model was established using an iterative process of inversion and forward modeling. The resultant model reveals three layers of differing resistivities within the unconsolidated sediments in the near surface, underlain by a highly resistive basalt at a depth of 30 m. The second set of resistivity data was acquired using a dipole-dipole electrode configuration. Two separate surveys, using 20 -m and 60 -m electrode separations (a-spacings), were conducted parallel to Line 1 beginning at the PVC well and ending near the Orchard Ranch well, providing resistivity data both laterally and vertically. Measurements were made at each field setup corresponding to n-spacings of 1, 2, 3, and 4. Pseudo-sections of apparent resistivity versus n-spacing allowed for qualitative interpretations of the data. In general, the near-surface sediments contain a shallow layer of high apparent resistivity, overlying a section of relatively low apparent resistivity. The absence of an abrupt resistivity increase in the deepest resistivity samples (60 -m dipole pseudo-section) may indicate that the basalt was not reached. The last survey was a CSAMT profile conducted along {{the entire length of the}} Line 1 refraction survey. A transmitting current electrode separation of 1525 m, located 1825 m due east of, and parallel to, refraction Line 1, was used in conjunction with a potential electrode spacing of 20 m and a magnetic coil to record orthogonal horizontal components of the electric and magnetic fields at 47 surface locations. This current and potential electrode separation distance was in excess of the 3 skin depth (far field) minimum separation necessary to ensure plane wave behavior for the resistivity and phase measurements. The CSAMT resistivity and phase data were processed with Zonge Engineering DATPRO software. A 2 -D smooth model inversion algorithm generated an earth resistivity model for a depth range of 50 - 400 m. This range likely falls entirely within the massive basalt unit as suggested from well logs. Two anomalous features stand out in the model. A region of extremely high resistivity in excess of 6000 Ω-m (as opposed to an average basalt resistivity of 200 Ω-m) appears near the vicinity of the Orchard Ranch well. This is most likely due to recording in a scrap metal dumping site near a steel <b>cased</b> <b>well</b> which has significantly contaminated the data and caused an unreliable inversion. A second notable feature is the presence of elevated resistivity vertical zonation at various locations along the profile. This has been interpreted as representing air-filled porosity within the basalt, possibly related to fractures or large void spaces...|$|E
