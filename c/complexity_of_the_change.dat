40|$|The <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> process Educational {{reform is}} ‘complex, non-linear, {{frequently}} arbitrary, and always highly political. It {{is rife with}} unpredictable shifts and fragmented initiatives ’ (Fullen, 1992). Furthermore, education systems are complex social systems which have considerable inertia (Lewin and Stuart, 1991 : 14). For these reasons, educational change is a ‘time-consuming process {{that needs to be}} repeated many times with considerable variation to account for specific local conditions ’ (Verspoor, 1989 : 26). Researchers have noted that attempts to change pedagogical practice in developing countries have largely failed because the reform initiatives did {{not take into account the}} social and economic contexts of schools. King (1989 : 45) argues that although material shortages are a contributing factor and a cause for concern, the main problem is that there is often a teaching and learning tradition in place which simply does not encourage or support learner-centred pedagogy. And, once a particular form of pedagogy takes root in a society ‘it has a resilience that is almost independent of changes in government, major curricular reforms or even changes in teacher training’...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, 2005 In physics, {{students}} are required to learn processes that change over time, for example how a manometer responds to changing pressure and how an electric motor works. Students usually find it difficult to understand <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> involved in such processes when they are described verbally or numerically. To overcome this difficulty, computer animations have been used to present <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> taking place visually. However, research has shown that computer animations might not be as effective as they were intended to be. This study aims to look at both the effectiveness and <b>the</b> limitations <b>of</b> computer animations in promoting <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> physics concepts in a Singaporean grade 9 physics class. The study adopted a naturalistic approach and focused on finding meaning from the students' perspective. Qualitative data was collected through lesson observations, student reflections about their learning experiences, student and teacher interviews and a student survey. It appears that <b>the</b> limitations <b>of</b> animations arise from a lack of consideration of how students learn. Students need to learn through social interaction and animations {{might not be able to}} provide the social interaction and motivation that students need. The study also revealed that computers could not replace classroom teachers as teachers still play a vital role in meeting the students' learning needs. Students need to interact socially with their teachers. They also need teachers to explain concepts in ways that make sense to them, monitor their learning and to motivate them to learn. It is also suggested that a teacher-controlled approach to using computer animations could be effective. Restricted Access: Staff and Students <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University Onl...|$|R

40|$|Based {{on field}} {{work that was}} done across Asia and the Pacific, this paper {{examines}} largely the broader issues associated with youth migration {{from the perspective of}} social disorganization. The paper focuses upon war, revolution, modernization, natural disaster, epidemic, and a change of social system, government, culture, or lifestyle ??? as major social forces behind migration. With regard to individual factors, the paper investigates such common avenues for migration as study, job change, travel, exile, refuge seeking, and family reunion ??? although it does not hone down on detailed ethnographic data. The intention is to focus on issues of explicit and implicit experiences of victimization that migration has brought to migrants and their families, as well as to local residents who are in contact with them. For example, domestic migrants face contrasts between home and an unfamiliar place, between rural villages and urban compounds, or between peaceful communities and disorganized neighborhoods while international migrants have to deal with language barriers, developmental gaps, and cultural differences between countries of origin and resettlement. The paper points out that social disorganization deviance, crime, and victimization among migrants, especially migrant youths, become not only inevitable due {{to the level of the}} change involved in the migratory movement, but also diversified because of the <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> accompanied by migrant crossings over regional and national borders...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} of {{a variation of the}} Developmental Work Research methodology (DWR) in the 'expansive learning' (Engeström 1991, 1999) of teacher educators within an influential school-university teacher education partnership in the UK. A hybrid research-development project (Developing English Teaching and Internship Learning - DETAIL) has aimed to reconfigure the partnership between the university and schools at a systemic level through the introduction of two new pedagogic tools and to focus on contradictions in exiting 'standard' practice as creative disturbances likely to be generative of positive change and development. The paper argues that the project's methodological framework - DWR and the concept of 'Change Laboratories' (Engeström 1999, 2007) - offers a powerful means of both understanding and working on the processes of change. It can achieve this by refocusing analysis culturally and historically at the systemic rather than the individual level and by using the tools of Activity Theory in a participatory way to support the learning of the 'change agents'. The paper highlights two instances from the DWR process to show how the introduction of the pedagogic tools - collaborative professional inquiry and collaborative planning and teaching - mediated participants' work on the object of activity.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} how complex educational {{change may}} be managed through the `metatask' of orchestration, narrowly distributed among senior formal leaders {{within and between}} different administrative levels of large public education systems. Orchestration implies steering the change process by organising and maintaining oversight of an intricate array of coordinated tasks. It is the over-arching `complex change management theme' of a hierarchically ordered typology derived inductively from a national study of district-wide initiatives to close or merge schools so as to reduce spare student capacity and {{improve the quality of}} educational provision. The paper explores patterns revealed by this research relating to orchestration. The research design and methods are outlined. The relationship is clarified between the concepts of orchestration, leadership and management. An analytical model is built-up for analysing complex educational change along three dimensions: change management themes, headed by orchestration; characteristics of the <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> with management implications; and stages of the change process. The constituents of each dimension in turn are described, briefly illustrated through reference to reorganisation, and linked with orchestration. Characteristics of complexity dictated the response of orchestration and the subordinate complex change management themes across the different stages of the change process. The analytical model is offered as a conceptual framework for future research that would test its wider applicability and as a practical planning tool. The importance is underlined of developing generic yet context-sensitive practical guidance that reflects the degree of complexity faced by orchestrators charged with managing contemporary educational change...|$|E

The research began with a consideration of a major change project at RMIT University: the Implementation of the Distributed Learning System (DLS). The problems associated with this project highlighted the need for holistic organisational approaches to change and the uncertain nature of radical change projects. This led into a consideration of broader questions to do with organisational change and managing uncertainty. The generalisability of the research findings was enhanced by the wide ranging literature review and data from a range of stakeholders. This ultimately led to the development of a "Maturity Model for Strategy" and a series of associated processes and management tools. These tools are offered as a means of assisting organisations wishing to understand the <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> process.

40|$|Aim: To {{describe}} emergency ambulance crews' {{views about}} (1) how they {{make decisions on}} whether to convey patients to hospital; (2) an intervention enabling them to triage patients to non-conveyance; and (3) their experience of using new protocols for undertaking such triage. Methods: Two focus groups were held {{at the outset of}} an evaluation of Treat and Refer (T&R) protocols: one with staff based at an ambulance station who were to implement the new service (intervention station), and the other with staff from a neighbouring station who would be continuing their normal practice during the study (control station). A third session was held with staff from the intervention station following training and 3 months' experience of protocol usage. Results: Before the introduction of the T&R protocols, crews reported experience, intuition, training, time of call during shift, patient preference, and home situation as influencing their decisions concerning conveyance. Crews were positive about changing practice but foresaw difficulties with advising patients who wanted to go to hospital, and with referral to other agencies. Following experience of T&R protocol use, crews felt they had needed more training than had been provided. Some felt their practice and job satisfaction had improved. Problems with referral and with persuading some patients that they did not need to go to hospital were discussed. There was consensus that the initiative should be introduced across the service. Conclusions: With crews generally positive about this intervention, an opportunity to tackle this difficult area of emergency care now exists.

40|$|Background: Provision of {{paediatric}} {{specific service}} areas {{within a hospital}} servicing both adult and paediatric populations is relatively novel. In Australia this is an emerging model for service delivery {{that takes into account}} the specific health needs of paediatric patients. To date, information related to the practice transition required by staff when adopting this model of care is lacking. Such information can contribute to informing service quality and identify staff perceived barriers and enablers during adoption of the model. The potential benefit of such knowledge is the early mitigation of issues and delineation of professional development requirements. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate staff experiences of transitioning from an essentially adult emergency department with minimal paediatric presentations to a new co-located paediatric emergency department. Methods: A qualitative descriptive design was used. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 emergency department staff (10 Nursing, 8 Medical) before and after the opening of the paediatric emergency department. Data were analysed thematically. Results: Five themes emerged from the data analysis, these were: (1) I am really scared that I won’t have the skills necessary, (2) Having a good knowledge base helps, (3) Open, transparent communication is definitely the best thing, (4) Personality plays an important role and (5) Perceptions regarding need to separate the services. Conclusions: The findings demonstrated the <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> process and highlights various factors that staff found contributed positively to the change process. These included the need for clear and open communication at all levels, focused educational opportunities, and employment of staff with a positive attitude towards change.

40|$|This thesis explores whether {{dialogue}} between {{a company and}} a non-profit organisation (NPO) can influence a company’s way of working towards being more conflict sensitive. As a case-study I analysed the {{dialogue between}} the French oil and gas company, Total S. A. (Total), and the US based NPO, CDA Collaborative Learning Projects (CDA) relating to the company’s operations in Myanmar/Burma. The objectives of the research were to ascertain if dialogue had a positive impact, and if so, {{what it was about}} the dialogue that enabled change, what was the process of change that could be observed and how embedded such change was. Drawing on post-modernism, systems thinking and complexity thinking, I have built on organisational change, conflict transformation, dialogue and cross-sector partnership literature to examine the role of dialogue as an enabler of change. While highlighting parallels in the discourses, I analyse the process and degree of change within the company through two conflict transformation models, one by Lederach (1997) and the other by Lederach, Neufeld and Culbertson (2007), which I feel best synthesise these parallels. The research is a longitudinal case-study (2002 - 2012), based on semi-structured interviews and document analysis. The study adds to the limited academic research on conflict sensitivity in general, and on the implications for a company’s way of working in particular. Although I find that within the business sector, the notion of conflict sensitivity is assumed in the wider concept of corporate social responsibility, noteworthy is the relevance of dialogue in change processes. Dialogue is an essential enabler as it sparks transformational levers also recognised in the literature reviewed. However it is not sufficient. The research illustrates that the dialogue between CDA and Total has {{played a critical role in}} facilitating a shift in the company’s way of working, with the contribution of other influences at play. As such, I draw attention to the <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> process and discuss the current nature of the drivers of change within Total...|$|E
40|$|Chinese {{media in}} the context of China's rise have puzzled many {{scholars}} who used to understand media and communications phenomena by employing the theories generated from a few affluent Western democracies, notably the US. As a result, a complex but more accurate picture has been ignored. Under numerous theoretical polarizations, the contemporary social world seems little changed but polarized. This thesis aims to propose a different approach endeavoring to 'de-Westernize' or 'internationalize' media and communications studies. As a starting point, this study focuses on the globalization debate, Chinese media and news agency studies. The thesis has investigated the Chinese news agency, Xinhua, by employing Fuzzy Logic which captures the <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in the agency's business structure and journalistic practices over last 25 years. The change is also examined by scrutinizing the role of journalists in the interrelations of Xinhua with its news sources, media and nonmedia clients, and other news agencies. A combination of archive study and 94 semistructured interviews conducted in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Macau and London provides an inclusive account of the Chinese news institution. The key research findings drawn from the empirical research into Xinhua have justified the central argument of this thesis: Crisp Logic or the 'either/or' approach has failed to explain the dynamics of the change to the media system based in a 'non-Western' society. The numerous theoretical polarizations generated by Crisp Logic to a large extent have distorted the understanding of the contemporary social world by polarizing it. Fuzzy Logic serves better(though {{it is not the only}} choice) than the traditional approach to reflect on the set of variables existing between the two poles created by Crisp Logic. This thesis is the first doctorate research in the UK and other English-speaking countries to investigate Xinhua by 'going inside' the news institution's headquarters, local branches and overseas bureaus. This is the first comprehensive academic study of the agency, which not only examines the agency's recent change in business structure and journalistic practices, but also provides a historical account of the agency and its relationship with other social institutions. This is the first media study that employs Fuzzy Logic to understand the globalization theory, Chinese media and news agencies. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
