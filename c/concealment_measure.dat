40|$|SIO Reference 61 - 16.   In the low-visibility type of {{camouflage}} and concealment, {{a useful}} criterion {{of the effectiveness}} of the measure taken is the sighting range of the target. This range {{is a function of the}} contrasts produced by. the various surfaces of the tacget against its background. Minimization of these contrasts minimizes the sighting ranges and is, therefore, an essential first step in the design of <b>concealment</b> <b>measures.</b> An engineering method has been developed by this Laboratory for minimizing the contrast of a Navy vessel under specified conditions. The purpose of this report is to describe the method and to illustrate the effectiveness of its use...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Devices like PDAs, {{mobile phones}} and Smartcards can com-municate {{with each other}} and to {{exchange}} information and they should be made mutually aware of each other. For privacy reasons, it is essen-tial for the devices to have different levels of awareness and <b>concealment</b> <b>measures</b> so that each device can control how much it wants to be aware of others and how much it wants to be concealed from others. Other works have modelled and implemented awareness among devices, but none, to our knowledge, has provided a formal grounding to their work. We propose a formal model for mutual aware devices, deriving from an existing work on virtual environment called spatial model of interactions. As proof of concept, we also describe two experimental prototypes based on our model. ...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) is {{interested}} in developing tools and methods for use in designing and evaluating safeguards systems for current and future plants in the nuclear power fuel cycle. The DOE is engaging several DOE National Laboratories in efforts applied to safeguards for chemical conversion plants and gaseous centrifuge enrichment plants. As part of the development, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has developed an integrated safeguards system analysis tool (LISSAT). This tool provides modeling and analysis of facility and safeguards operations, generation of diversion paths, and evaluation of safeguards system effectiveness. The constituent elements of diversion scenarios, including material extraction and <b>concealment</b> <b>measures,</b> are structured using directed graphs (digraphs) and fault trees. Statistical analysis evaluates the effectiveness of measurement verification plans and randomly timed inspections. Time domain simulations analyze significant scenarios, especially those involving alternate time ordering of events or issues of timeliness. Such simulations can provide additional information to the fault tree analysis and can help identify the range of normal operations and, by extension, identify additional plant operational signatures of diversions. LISSAT analyses {{can be used to}} compare the diversion-detection probabilities for individual safeguards technologies and to inform overall strategy implementations for present and future plants. Additionally, LISSAT can be the basis for a rigorous cost-effectiveness analysis of safeguards and design options. This paper will describe the results of a LISSAT analysis of a generic centrifuge enrichment plant. The paper will describe the diversion scenarios analyzed and the effectiveness of various safeguards systems alternatives...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2009 We {{assessed}} use {{and selection}} of cover by coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii) in six headwater streams in three watersheds in western Oregon, USA {{during the summer}} low flow period from 1 August and September 30, 2007. We tagged 1037 coastal cutthroat trout (> 100 mm) with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags across all streams. Selection of cover was analyzed by comparing characteristics of locations used for concealment by relocated fish relative to characteristics of randomly available habitat {{that could be used}} for <b>concealment.</b> We <b>measured</b> habitat characteristics for 190 relocated individual fish using cover and 797 randomly points potentially available as cover. Of the latter points, only 235 of 797 were potential cover, based on characteristics of cover actually used by fish. In other words, 562 of the 797 randomly sampled points were unlikely to be used as cover by fish. Coastal cutthroat trout used substrate as cover (78...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an interleaving concealment method to improve speech quality deterioration caused by packet losses for CELP based coders. We applied the proposed scheme {{to the standard}} ITU-T G 729 standard speech coder to evaluate the proposed method. The perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) and enhanced modified bark spectral distortion (EMBSD) tests under various packet loss conditions confirm that the proposed algorithm is superior to the concealment algorithm embedded in the G 729. The spectral distortion measure is also used as an objective distortion measure; the obtained results prove that the interleaving method is better {{at the expense of}} extra delay.

40|$|In {{a digital}} video communication, the encoder {{can play a}} very {{important}} role on what can be achieved at the decoder side in terms of error processing. To behave in the best way, {{it is important that the}} encoder try to foresee the difficulties that the decoder will face dealing with errors and work to help it, notably in the most critical moments. In particular, if the encoder evaluates how difficult certain errors are to conceal, it will be able to better decide the amount of error resilience overhead to be used and where. This evaluation at the encoder may be done by considering the video data being encoded and the coding scheme being used. When object-based video coding schemes such as the one specified by the MPEG- 4 standard are considered, channel errors can affect both the shape and texture data, which can be concealed using spatial and/or temporal techniques. In this paper, a spatial shape <b>concealment</b> difficulty <b>measure</b> based on an MPEG- 7 descriptor is proposed, with the target to allow the encoder to control the amount of intra-coding refreshment to be used for the shape information in order to improve the concealment performance at the decoder.

In this paper, a packet loss {{concealment}} scheme based interleaving is presented to improve speech quality deterioration caused by packet losses for code-excited linear prediction (CELP) based coders. We applied the proposed scheme to the ITU-T G 729 8 kb/s speech coding standard to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) and enhanced modified bark spectral distortion (EMBSD) tests under various packet loss conditions confirm that the proposed algorithm is superior to the concealment algorithm embedded in the G 729.

Although self-help interventions are effective in treating depression, less {{is known about the}} factors that determine effectiveness (i. e. moderators of effect). This study sought to determine whether the content of self-help interventions, the study populations or aspects of study design were the most important moderators. Method. Randomized trials of the effectiveness of self-help interventions versus controls in the treatment of depressive symptoms were identified using previous reviews and electronic database searches. Data on moderators (i. e. patient populations, study design, intervention content) and outcomes were extracted and analysed using meta-regression. Results. Thirty-four studies were identified with 39 comparisons. Study design factors associated with greater effectiveness were unclear allocation <b>concealment,</b> observer-rated outcome <b>measures</b> and waiting-list control groups. Greater effectiveness was also associated with recruitment in non-clinical settings, patients with existing depression (rather than those â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 at risk â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9), contact with a therapist (i. e. guided self-help) and the use of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) techniques. However, only guided self-help remained significant in the multivariate analysis [regression coefficient 0. 36, 95...|$|R
