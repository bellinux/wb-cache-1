40|$|The six {{species in}} the genus Micrastur are small to {{medium-sized}} Neotropical forest-inhabiting falconids. With Accipiter-like short wings and long tails, forest-falcons are secre-tive, often crepuscular hunters (Thorstrom 1993). Though Micrastur spp. are often abun-dant, the first nest for the genus was not found until 1978 (Mader 1979), and the first Barred Forest-falcon (Micrastur ruficollis) nest was not described until 1990 (Thorstrom et al. 1990). Thorstrom (1993) spent considerable time in Petén, Guatemala studying this spe-cies and the congeneric <b>Collared</b> <b>Forest-falcon</b> (M. semitorquatus), finding 38 Barred and five <b>Collared</b> <b>forest-falcon</b> nestings, in 22 and five nest sites, respectively. All of these were in tree cavities, as was the nest described by Mader (1979). In addition, there is a pub-lished report of Collared Forest-falcons nest-ing in a ruined building (Cobb 1990, cited by Howell and Webb 1995). To our knowledge, ing of M. gilvicollis in a stick nest has been regarded as probably erroneous (del Hoyo et al. 1994) ...|$|E
40|$|We studied Collared Forest-Falcons Micrastur semitorquatus in Tikal National Park, Guatemala from 1988 through 1993, documenting 9 nesting attempts. The <b>Collared</b> <b>Forest-Falcon</b> is {{a year-round}} resident, nesting in {{pre-existing}} cavities in large trees. Breeding commenced {{during the middle}} of the dry season. Egg laying occurred early March to early April, with laying peaking in early March and spanning 30 days (n = 8 clutches), with one exceptionally late laying date in May. The incubation period was 46 – 48 days at 1 nest and nestlings fledged on average at 50 days of age (n = 5). Only females incubated while males pro-vided food until the mid-nestling period when the females began hunting and delivering prey to the young. Young fledged in June, early in the rainy season and were not observed again at the cavity. Of 16 eggs laid in 8 nests (mean = 2. 0), 10 of 16 (63 %) hatched, and 8 (80 %) of those hatchlings fledged. The only repro-ductive losses resulted from egg depredation (n = 2 nests). The breeding period of the <b>Collared</b> <b>Forest-Falcon</b> lasted approximately 28 weeks from courtship to fledgling dispersal, long in comparison to simi-larly-sized temperate raptors.

40|$|I {{studied the}} {{breeding}} biology, food habits, and home ranges of the Barred Forest-Falcon (Micrastur ruficollis) and the <b>Collared</b> <b>Forest-Falcon</b> (M. semitorquatus) in Tikal National Park of northeastern Guatemala from 1988 to 1992. Barred and Collared Forest-Falcons are residents and maintain territories throughout the year. Barred Forest-Falcon breeding {{coincides with the}} end of the dry and beginning of the wet seasons. Nesting sites were occupied in April, May, and June and average reoccupancy rate was 86 %. Thirty-eight nests were located in tree cavities. The onset of egg-laying was in mid April to early June. The incubation period was 37 days from laying of the first egg to hatch (n= 6 nests) and the average age of fledging was 38. 3 days (SD± 3. 3, range= 35 - 44 days). Fledging occurred in July and August. Of 34 fully documented nesting attempts 16 (47 %) produced young. A total of 1. 1 young fledged per breeding attempt. Most reproductive losses in 17 nests resulted from egg predation (n=ll). Survivability of adult breeding females was less than that for males. Food habits were based on 600 prey deliveries during the breeding season. On a numerical basis, lizards made up 40. 8 % (n= 245) and birds 14. 6 % (n= 88) of the diet. Biomass estimates showed lizards 37. 3 % and birds 36. 8 % to be the most important prey items delivered during the breeding season. Home range estimates of 85 harmonic means averaged 114. 6 ± 28. 8 ha for breeding males (n=ll). <b>Collared</b> <b>Forest-Falcon</b> breeding occurs at the end of the rainy season through the dry season to the beginning of the rainy season in June and July. Nesting sites were occupied in February and March. Eight nests were located, seven in Tikal and one outside the park. Laying occurred in late February to mid May. The incubation period was 47 days (n=l nest) and the average age of young fledging was 50. 0 ± 4. 2 days (ranging from 46 to 56 days). Fledging occurred in June. Overall reproductive success was 57 % (4 nests fledged young out of 7 attempts). Productivity was 1. 0 young fledged per breeding attempt. Nest failures were caused by predation on eggs. Food habits were based on 258 prey items delivered during the breeding season. On a numerical basis (n= 222 prey items) mammals 35. 1 % (n= 78) and birds 26. 5 % (n= 59) made up the major proportion of the diet. Biomass estimates showed mammals 45. 6 % and birds 49. 4 % to be the most important prey delivered during the breeding seasons. An extra adult took over parental duties of feeding fledglings in 1990 and delivered 36 prey items. Home range estimates for the 85 % harmonic means averaged 877. 6 ± 301. 6 ha for males (n= 3, two breeding and one nonbreeding) and 712. 0 ± 578. 7 ha for females (n= 4, one breeding and three nonbreeding) ...|$|E
