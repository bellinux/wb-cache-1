40|$|Aim:  <b>Liver</b> <b>dysfunction</b> is not rare in {{patients}} with collagen disease. We sought to elucidate the <b>clinical</b> features of <b>liver</b> <b>dysfunction</b> {{in the presence of}} collagen disease. Methods:  We analyzed the frequency and causes of <b>liver</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in 607 patients (rheumatoid arthritis [RA], n = 220; systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], n = 164; systemic sclerosis [SSc], n = 47; Sjögren's syndrome [SjS], n = 44; Behçet's disease, n = 43; polymyositis/dermatomyositis [PM/DM], n = 27; vasculitis syndrome, n = 25; mixed connective tissue disease [MCTD], n = 21; and adult-onset Still's disease [AOSD], n = 16). Results:  <b>Liver</b> <b>dysfunction</b> was observed in 238 (39. 2 %) of 607 patients showing collagen disease. Patients with AOSD (81. 3 %), PM/DM (51. 9 %) and vasculitis syndrome (48. 0 %) frequently displayed <b>liver</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> <b>Liver</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in collagen diseases results from many causes; drug-induced liver injury (26. 1 %), fatty liver (7. 6 %), viral hepatitis (1. 3 %), autoimmune hepatitis (4. 2 %), primary biliary cirrhosis (15. 9 %) and the collagen disease itself (15. 5 %). Conversely, primary biliary cirrhosis was a leading cause in SSc (76. 1 %) and SjS (70. 0 %). <b>Liver</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in collagen disease tended to be mild. In addition, alanine aminotransferase levels correlated positively with ferritin levels in AOSD (R = 0. 708, P < 0. 05). Moreover, alkaline phosphatase levels correlated positively with C reactive protein levels in vasculitis syndrome (R = 0. 833, P < 0. 05). Conclusion:  <b>Liver</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in the presence of collagen disease has various causes, and dysfunction associated with collagen disease reflects the activity of the collagen disease itself...|$|R
40|$|Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} (LCH) is a {{rare disease}} of unknown etiology characterized by oligoclonal proliferation of Langerhans cells. The diagnosis of LCH {{is complicated by the}} fact that it may involve multiple organ systems and its clinical presentation and course varies, ranging from an isolated to a multisystem disease. We report a 35 -year-old male with LCH involving multiple systems, including the bones, lungs, spleen, liver and bile ducts, whose first <b>clinical</b> presentation was <b>liver</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> The patient was diagnosed following a skull biopsy that revealed infiltration of Langerhans cells. However, a liver biopsy revealed sclerosing cholangitis (SC) with no signs of Langerhans cell infiltration, and the clinical manifestations of the involved organs were atypical, leading to a delayed diagnosis.

40|$|AIMS [...] To {{evaluate}} serum glutathione S-transferase B 1 (GST B 1), {{a highly}} sensitive test of hepatocellular function, {{as a means}} of identifying liver disease in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). METHODS [...] The presence of liver disease was sought over a three year period in 60 children with CF, using a combination of clinical assessment, ultrasound examination, conventional biochemical tests of liver function (LFTs), and measurement of GST B 1. RESULTS [...] Reference ranges for serum GST B 1 were established in a paediatric control population. The 95 % value (4. 55 micrograms/l) was similar to the upper limit of normal previously derived in adults. Mean (SE) serum GST B 1 activities were higher in the CF population (9. 0 (1. 14) micrograms/l) than in age matched controls (2. 4 (0. 15) micrograms/l). Ten patients with CF showed <b>clinical</b> signs of <b>liver</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> All but one had a serum GST B 1 > 4. 55 micrograms/l. Twelve other patients had elevated LFTs without clinically evident <b>liver</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> six had abnormal ultrasound scans and two showed both of these anomalies. Thirty patients with CF had neither biochemical, ultrasonographic nor <b>clinical</b> signs of <b>liver</b> disease. On review three years later, clinically important liver disease was reaffirmed in eight of the 10 index cases and had become apparent in a further eight, all of whom had elevated GST B 1 activities. Five (36 %) of the patients with elevated LFTs and two (33 %) with isolated ultrasound changes continued to show these abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS [...] The limitations of conventional LFTs and ultrasound scans were evident from this study. The results suggest that elevated GST B 1 activities may be a better predictor of hepatic dysfunction in CF than conventional LFTs...|$|R

Thirty patients developed postoperative <b>liver</b> <b>dysfunction</b> (serum total bilirubin≧ 2. 0 mg/dl) which recovered within 14 days after surgery. In these patients, the ratios of portal velocity after surgery to that before surgery were significantly increased compared to those in 7 patients who did not recover from <b>liver</b> <b>dysfunction</b> within 14 days.

Of them, the incidence of drug-related severe <b>liver</b> <b>dysfunction</b> rarely occurs (< 1  %) but is one of the serious adverse events by sorafenib.
