500|$|Meanwhile, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{realizes that}} {{although}} she has her dream job of salesman, she just might not be cut out for it after all since she makes few sales and very little money. A chance visit from a vendor gives her an idea to finagle a promotion to office administrator, hopefully for some added income. She informs Gabe of her promotion [...] "from a few months back" [...] and tells him {{she has not been}} paid accordingly, to which Gabe promises her he will get the missing wages if she <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b> of the department heads to sign off on it. While she is busy convincing everyone that she has become the new administrator, Gabe catches on that she might be lying, and confronts her about it.

While Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero II are fully backward-compatible through the hardware PlayStation 2 emulation {{in the initial}} North American release of the console, it was impossible at launch to use the guitar controller to play either game. Kai Huang, of RedOctane, states that they are [...] "working on that with Sony right now – looking at how we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b> the PlayStation 2 guitars that are out there, and all the owners of them, to use them on the PlayStation 3." [...] Nyko, an accessories company, was poised to make a special PlayStation 2 controller adapter for the PlayStation 3, but put the product on hold due to technical difficulties. Tac, another accessories company, also made a PlayStation 2 controller adapter for a PlayStation 3 game console so players could use their Guitar Hero guitar controllers that were made for the PlayStation 2 with a PlayStation 3. However, the May 2007 PlayStation 3 V1.80 system update has made the guitar controller compatible with generic PlayStation 2 controller to USB adapters when playing Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero II. In addition, Pelican Accessories has released a special controller adapter that supports both games, including the ability to switch the handedness of the guitar.|$|E
