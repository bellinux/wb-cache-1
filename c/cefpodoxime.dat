40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the effect of the antibiotic <b>cefpodoxime</b> on the gram-negative periodontopathic microorganism Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and its interaction with elements of the host immune system. Growth of A. actinomycetemcomitans in subinhibitory concentrations of <b>cefpodoxime</b> induced morphological changes in the bacteria, causing the organisms to grow as filaments rather than coccobacilli. Growth in <b>cefpodoxime</b> did not render these bacteria susceptible to killing by serum, nor did it abrogate the requirement for serum opsonins to support the bactericidal activity of neutrophils. <b>Cefpodoxime</b> enhanced the susceptibility of A. actinomycetemcomitans to the bactericidal activity of neutrophils. In the presence of suitable opsonins, neutrophils were able to kill four times as many cefpodoxime-induced A. actinomycetemcomitans filaments as untreated A. actinomycetemcomitans CFU. This effect was due to antibiotic actions on the bacterium and not on the neutrophil.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were (1) to compare the in vitro {{dissolution}} profiles of Solid dispersion of <b>Cefpodoxime</b> Proxetil with PEG 6000, with those of pure drug and physical mixture of <b>Cefpodoxime</b> proxetil and PEG 6000. (2) to apply statistical models to evaluate each ratio of <b>Cefpodoxime</b> proxetil and PEG 6000 in solid dispersion in terms of easy application and usefulness, and (3) to identify the most suitable ratio of <b>Cefpodoxime</b> Proxetil and PEG 6000 as solid dispersion. Solid dispersions of <b>Cefpodoxime</b> Proxetil were prepared with PEG 6000 in different ratios by using kneading method. Dissolution profile of all these solid dispersions were compared with dissolution profile of <b>Cefpodoxime</b> proxetil and physical mixture of <b>Cefpodoxime</b> proxetil and PEG 6000. The results showed that the Solid dispersions containing PEG in different proportions exhibit faster release (about 2. 2 – 3 fold faster) than <b>Cefpodoxime</b> proxetil and physical mixture of <b>Cefpodoxime</b> proxetil and PEG. Among the solid dispersions containing different ratios batch A containing <b>Cefpodoxime</b> proxetil and PEG 6000 in 1 : 1 ratio exhibited about 3 fold improvement in release profile.

We assessed the efficacy of <b>cefpodoxime</b> for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) in Egyptian adults, and evaluated its safety in daily practice. Methods: This prospective, observational, multicentre study recruited adult patients, presenting with acute maxillary sinusitis and tonsilopharyngitis, prescribed 200 Â mg/day <b>cefpodoxime</b> for 5 â 10 Â days by their physicians decision. Effectiveness, defined as the proportion of patients exhibiting a complete recovery of clinical symptoms for acute sinusitis and tonsilopharyngitis, was assessed.

Significant reductions in URTI-related signs and symptoms were observed in subjects prescribed <b>cefpodoxime</b> for a mean 5. 87 Â Â±Â  1. 73 Â days. An 83. 3 % cure rate and a 16. 2 % improvement rate were noted for both acute maxillary sinusitis and tonsilopharyngitis patients. Superior outcomes were observed in patients with acute tonsilopharyngitis compared to the acute maxillary sinusitis cohort (86. 3 % and 77. 4 %, respectively; pÂ <Â  0. 001).

40|$|ABSTRACT. A Kinetics pathway of {{oxidation}} of <b>Cefpodoxime</b> Proxetil by permanganate in {{alkaline medium}} {{at a constant}} ionic strength has been studied spectrophotometrically. The reaction showed first order kinetics in permanganate ion concentration and an order less than unity in <b>cefpodoxime</b> acid and alkali concentrations. Increasing ionic strength of the medium increase the rate. The oxidation reaction proceeds via an alkali-permanganate species which forms a complex with <b>cefpodoxime</b> acid. The latter decomposes slowly, followed by a fast reaction between a free radical of <b>cefpodoxime</b> acid and another molecule of permanganate to give the products. Investigations of the reaction at different temperatures allowed the determination of activation parameters {{with respect to the}} slow step of proposed mechanism and fallows first order kinetics. The proposed mechanism and the derived rate laws are consistent with the observed kinetics...|$|E
40|$|The {{disposition}} of <b>cefpodoxime</b> in 24 subjects with {{various degrees of}} renal function after administration of a single oral dose of 200 mg of <b>cefpodoxime</b> proxetil (equivalent to 200 mg of <b>cefpodoxime</b> activity) was studied. Subjects were {{assigned to one of}} four groups (six per group) : group I, normal renal function (creatinine clearance [CLCR], greater than ml/min); group II, mild renal impairment (CLCR, 50 to 80 ml/min); group III, moderate renal impairment (CLCR, 30 to 49 ml/min); or group IV, severe renal impairment (CLCR, 5 to 29 ml/min). Although <b>cefpodoxime</b> terminal elimination half-life in group I (2. 55 +/- 0. 25 h [mean +/- standard deviation]) was not significantly different from that in group II (3. 53 +/- 0. 74 h), the half-life values for group III (5. 90 +/- 1. 67 h) and group IV (9. 80 +/- 1. 21 h) were significantly prolonged compared with those of group I. The mean absorption rate constant was similar among groups and ranged from 0. 68 to 0. 85 h- 1. All groups exhibited absorption lag-times which were comparable (0. 30 to 0. 41 h), and the apparent volume of distribution was similar among groups. <b>Cefpodoxime</b> apparent total body clearance (CLP/F) values in groups II, III, and IV (132 +/- 29, 112 +/- 41, and 55. 7 +/- 9. 9 ml/min, respectively) were significantly lower than that in group I (238 +/- 44 ml/min). <b>Cefpodoxime</b> CLP/F was positively correlated with CLCR (r 2 = 0. 79; P less than 0. 05) : CLP/F = (1. 9 CLCR) + 18. 4. Renal clearance also declined with decreasing renal function. Adjustments in <b>cefpodoxime</b> organism and on the site and severity of infection. Simulated plasma concentration-time data from this study suggest that 200 mg of <b>cefpodoxime</b> proxetil administered every 12 to 24 h to subjects with CLcr between 30 and 49 ml/min and 200 -mg dose taken every 24 h by subjects with CLcr between 5 and 29 ml/min will maintain <b>cefpodoxime</b> concentration in plasma similar to those in subjects with normal renal function who receive a standard dosage mg every 12 h...|$|E
40|$|The present {{manuscript}} describes simple, sensitive, rapid, accurate, {{precise and}} economical dual wavelength spectrophotometric method for the simultaneous determination of Ambroxol Hydrochloride and <b>Cefpodoxime</b> Proxetile in combined tablet dosage form. The principle for dual wavelength method is “the absorbance difference between two {{points on the}} mixture spectra is directly proportional to the concentration of the component of interest”. The method was based on determination of <b>Cefpodoxime</b> proxetile at the absorbance difference between 230 nm and 251. 8 nm and Ambroxol Hydrochloride at the absorbance difference between 250. 7 nm and 279 nm. The linearity was obtained in the concentration range of 6 - 42 μg/ml and 10 - 70 μg/ml for Ambroxol Hydrochloride and <b>Cefpodoxime</b> Proxetile respectively. The method was successfully applied to pharmaceutical dosage form because no interference from the tablet excipients was found. The suitability of these methods for the quantitative determination of Ambroxol Hydrochloride and <b>Cefpodoxime</b> Proxetile was proved by validation and recovery study. The proposed methods {{were found to be}} simple and sensitive for the routine quality control application of Ambroxol Hydrochloride and <b>Cefpodoxime</b> Proxetile in pharmaceutical tablet dosage form...|$|E
