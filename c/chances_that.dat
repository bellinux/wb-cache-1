5|$|Seattle {{replaced}} Lamar Neagle with Pappa in the 74th {{minute in}} an attempt to create an advantage. Philadelphia answered with two more <b>chances</b> <b>that</b> almost won the match. Casey received a yellow card at the 57th minute and was later replaced by Pedro Ribeiro. In the 88th minute, Raymon Gaddis won the ball and took a shot that was deflected. Ribeiro took a shot but it lacked power. In stoppage time, Vincent Nogueira had another close shot that struck the post and ricocheted dangerously close to the goal before being cleared.|$|E
5|$|The rider applies {{torque to}} the {{handlebars}} {{in order to}} turn the front wheel and so to control lean and maintain balance. At high speeds, small steering angles quickly move the ground contact points laterally; at low speeds, larger steering angles are required {{to achieve the same}} results in the same amount of time. Because of this, it is usually easier to maintain balance at high speeds. As self-stability typically occurs at speeds above a certain threshold, going faster increases the <b>chances</b> <b>that</b> a bike is contributing to its own stability.|$|E
5|$|During Spring Training {{before the}} 2017 season, the final {{guaranteed}} year on Molina's contract, the Cardinals began {{to negotiate a}} contract extension that would attempt to keep Molina in St. Louis {{for the remainder of}} his career. He agreed to a three-year contract extension for a reported $60 million, making him the highest-paid catcher in baseball. He wasn't interested in exercising his 2018 mutual option, which would have been worth $15 million. The extension assures Molina of remaining in St. Louis through 2020, and increases the <b>chances</b> <b>that</b> he will finish his career having played for just one organization, the one that drafted him. This distinction of having Molina retire as a Cardinal is something that carried weight for both parties throughout the negotiations.|$|E

5|$|He {{retained}} {{his place}} for the following Test and for the tour of South Africa in summer 1966–67. Playing in a side defeated 1–3, Chappell struggled to make an impression. His highest score in ten Test innings was 49, while his five wickets cost 59 runs each. On the advice of Simpson, he ceased playing the hook shot as it was often leading to his dismissal. In the first Test of 1967–68 against India, he failed twice batting in the middle order. Heading into the second Test at Melbourne, Chappell's place was in jeopardy, but he rode his luck to score 151 – his innings contained five <b>chances</b> <b>that</b> the Indians failed to take. However, {{in the remainder of}} the series, he managed only 46 runs in four innings, so his selection for the 1968 tour of England was based as much on potential as form.|$|E
5|$|Tombaugh's {{task was}} to {{systematically}} capture sections {{of the night sky}} in pairs of images. Each image in a pair was taken two weeks apart. He then placed both images of each section in a machine called a blink comparator, which by exchanging images quickly created a time lapse illusion of the movement of any planetary body. To reduce the <b>chances</b> <b>that</b> a faster-moving (and thus closer) object be mistaken for the new planet, Tombaugh imaged each region near its opposition point, 180 degrees from the Sun, where the apparent retrograde motion for objects beyond Earth's orbit is at its strongest. He also took a third image as a control to eliminate any false results caused by defects in an individual plate. Tombaugh decided to image the entire zodiac, rather than focus on those regions suggested by Lowell.|$|E
5|$|Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; {{angelfish}} and zebras are striped. These patterns have {{an evolutionary}} explanation: they have functions which increase the <b>chances</b> <b>that</b> {{the offspring of}} the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is camouflage; for instance, a leopard that is harder to see catches more prey. Another function is signalling — for instance, a ladybird {{is less likely to}} be attacked by predatory birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also distastefully bitter or poisonous, or mimics other distasteful insects. A young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try to eat it, but it will only do this once; very soon it will spit out the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting genes that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.|$|E

5|$|While {{still at}} high school, Morris was {{selected}} {{to play for the}} New South Wales Second XI against Victoria in January 1939, his first taste of representative cricket. However, Morris made only six and three and did not gain further honours. After finishing his secondary education at the end of 1939, Morris became a clerk in the Prosecutions Branch at Sydney Town Hall. He was chosen to make his debut, aged 18, for New South Wales against Queensland at the Sydney Cricket Ground in the 1940–41 season, a season in which there was no Sheffield Shield cricket due to the Second World War. He scored centuries in both innings, becoming the first player in the world to achieve the feat on debut. Morris made 148 in the first innings and participated in a second wicket partnership of 261 with Sid Barnes; he added 111 in the second innings, completing his feat on 28 December. He gave <b>chances</b> <b>that</b> were dropped early in both innings, but impressed observers with his ability to remain settled. New South Wales went on to win by 404 runs. He was unable to maintain the standard of his debut in later performances, but finished the war-shortened season with 385 runs at a strong average of 55.14 in four matches.|$|E

40|$|This article {{tests the}} {{applicability}} of Treas’s transaction cost economic framework to con-texts outside the allocation of bank accounts among married couples in the United States. Using the Japanese Panel Study of Consumer Life, the authors apply logistic regressions among Japanese couples who have joint accounts to predict (a) the <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> the wife has a separate bank account from the joint account and (b) the <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> she has an allowance. The results provide only partial support for the hypotheses based on Treas’s framework. Whereas Treas argues that the potential discontinuity of a marriage has {{a major influence on}} a couple’s separate financial arrangement, the study finds no evidence consistent with this ar-gument. Although some of Treas’s hypotheses are well supported when predicting the <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> a Japanese wife has an allowance, the same hypotheses are not supported when predicting the <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> she has a separate bank account...|$|R

25|$|The <b>chances</b> <b>that</b> {{a person}} will suffer PTS are {{influenced}} by factors involving the injury and the person. The largest risks for PTS are having an altered level of consciousness for a protracted time after the injury, severe injuries with focal lesions, and fractures. The single largest risk for PTS is penetrating head trauma, which carries a 35 to 50% risk of seizures within 15years. If a fragment of metal remains within the skull after injury, the risk of both early and late PTS may be increased. Head trauma survivors who abused alcohol before the injury are also at higher risk for developing seizures.|$|E
25|$|David Denton (4 July 1874 – 16 February 1950) was an English {{first-class}} cricketer. An attacking batsman, {{he had a}} {{long career}} with Yorkshire and played eleven Tests for England. His nickname of 'Lucky' came from his habit of surviving the numerous <b>chances,</b> <b>that</b> his attacking batting style naturally created for the opposition. He was a fine deep fielder, and was said to be an excellent judge of a high catch, but did little bowling: his only really significant contribution with the ball came in 1896, when he took 5–42 against South of England. He also had one first-class stumping to his name, against Cambridge University in 1905.|$|E
