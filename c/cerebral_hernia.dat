50|$|Two sources provide {{evidence}} of crested chickens in Europe in Roman times: the two marble statuettes of crested chickens noticed in the Sala degli Animali ("animal hall") of the Vatican Museums in 1927 by Alessandro Ghigi date from the 1st or 2nd century AD; a chicken skull excavated at West Hill, Uley, Gloucestershire in England shows the typical <b>cerebral</b> <b>hernia</b> of the crested breeds and dates from the 4th century.|$|E
30|$|The {{significant}} pain {{resulting from}} scalp incision {{is a strong}} nociceptive stimulus that can provoke abrupt changes in sympathetic activity and haemodynamics (Hillman et al. 1987). Acute hypertension is deleterious for neurosurgical patients because it may translate into increasing intracranial pressure and increased risk of cerebral aneurysm rupture. This effect can result in haemorrhage, <b>cerebral</b> <b>hernia</b> or pulmonary oedema (Basali et al. 2000), {{all of which are}} fatal complications. Research has shown that sufficient analgesia can prevent common postoperative side effects, enhance patient comfort and facilitate the recovery process (Lux et al. 2011; Taylor et al. 2013). Therefore, effective perioperative pain management is highly demanded to prevent the acute hypertension-related morbidity in neurosurgical patients.|$|E
40|$|Acute aortic {{dissection}} is {{a life-threatening}} condition requiring immediate assessment and therapy. Rarely, aortic dis-section involves carotid arteries and manifest cerebral infarction. Here, we report {{a case of}} aortic dissection complicated with fatal cerebral infarction. A 83 -year-old man, who suddenly suffered consciousness disturbance and right hemiparesis, was transferred to our hospital {{for the treatment of}} stroke. Magnetic resonance image revealed massive cerebral infarction in the left cerebral hemisphere as well as occlusion of the left internal carotid artery. Duplex ultrasonography demonstrated arterial dissection in the bilateral carotid arteries and the blood flow was compromised especially in the left side. Aortic dissection was confirmed by the contrast enhanced computed tomography. He was treated conservatively and died of <b>cerebral</b> <b>hernia</b> three days after the onset. In conclusion, aortic dissection may involve carotid artery and results in cerebral infarction. Ultrasound screening can aid timely diagnosis of aortic dissection and further management...|$|E
30|$|The {{study group}} {{consisted}} of 13 men and 5 women, aging from 47 to 98  years (mean: 78.2  ±  15.1  years).

5000|$|It is Hill’s chapter {{entitled}} ‘Disorders of {{the head}} from external violence’ that marks him out as a careful clinician and an innovative surgeon able to achieve remarkable outcomes {{by the standards of}} the day. Hill recorded 18 cases of head injury which he had treated over 40 years. The cause of the injury, the clinical features, his treatment and the outcome in each case are all recorded in detail. Head injuries, he asserts, have been treated in ‘a much more rational manner’ in the previous 15 years as a result of discoveries and ‘valuable publications’ over that period. He describes the rationale for his treatment and how this changed over time as his knowledge and understanding of the problems progressively increased. He gives ‘a historical view of the gradual progress of the improvements made by others as well as by myself.’His ﬁrst patient, a ﬁve-year-old boy, sustained a depressed frontal fracture associated with an epidural haematoma (EDH). When the fracture was elevated and the haematoma drained by trepanning the skull, the boy ‘immediately recovered his senses’ but after some days the ‘stupor’ returned, indicating that 'some matter was lodged under the meninges’. Hill made a cruciate incision in the meninges to drain the haematoma with beneﬁcial eﬀect. Ganz regarded this as the ﬁrst ever description of a lucid interval associated with a subdural haematoma.This case also demonstrates Hill’s understanding of the clinical features of cerebral compression: ‘The smallest compression brought on a stupor, a low intermittent pulse, nausea, vomiting and sometimes convulsive twitches.’ From case 3 onwards he avoided dressings which compressed the trepanned area.In case 3 he again relieved the features of cerebral compression by a trepan with drainage of an EDH. In case 5 drainage of a large EDH resulted in restoration of consciousness and resolution of a right sided weakness. His account of this case also shows that he appreciated the concept that paralysis on one side of the body indicated compression on the opposite side of the brain. This patient, who crucially did not have a fracture, demonstrates Hill’s appreciation that it was injury to the brain that caused symptoms rather than the fracture itself. Percival Pott (1714-1788) by contrast would only operate if a fracture were present. Hill’s understanding of concepts of cerebral compression is demonstrated further by his use of the word ‘compression’ and by his recording of cerebral pulsation or tension in all but one of the operations described. Both of his patients who exhibited poor or absent cerebral pulsation had sustained primary cerebral damage and both died. Hill more than any other eighteenth century writer appreciated the importance of cerebral pulsation as an indicator of cerebral health.Further evidence of his understanding of the need to decompress where possible is shown by his use of the technique of relieving pressure by shaving oﬀ <b>cerebral</b> <b>hernias</b> caused by raised intracranial pressure, a technique he learned from the writing of Henri Francois Le Dran (1685-1770). Hill’s outcomes in treating patients with head injury compares favourably with those of his contemporaries with a mortality rate of 25%, much lower than that of le Dran (57%) or Percival Pott (51%). This was the result of Hill’s appreciation of the concept of cerebral compression and his better understanding of the indication for and location of the trephine. Hill’s work was recognised and was cited by the inﬂuential Edinburgh physician John Abercrombie(1780-1844), the Edinburgh surgeon John Bell (1763-1820)) and the London surgeon John Abernethy (1764-1831) ...|$|R
40|$|The Crest {{phenotype}} is characterised by a tuft of elongated feathers {{atop the}} head. A similar phenotype is also seen in several wild bird species. Crest shows an autosomal incompletely dominant mode of inheritance and {{is associated with}} <b>cerebral</b> <b>hernia.</b> Here we show, using linkage analysis and genome-wide association, that Crest {{is located on the}} E 22 C 19 W 28 linkage group and that it shows complete association to the HOXC-cluster on this chromosome. Expression analysis of tissues from Crested and non-crested chickens, representing 26 different breeds, revealed that HOXC 8, but not HOXC 12 or HOXC 13, showed ectopic expression in cranial skin during embryonic development. We propose that Crest is caused by a cis-acting regulatory mutation underlying the ectopic expression of HOXC 8. However, the identification of the causative mutation(s) has to await until a method becomes available for assembling this chromosomal region. Crest is unfortunately located in a genomic region that has so far defied all attempts to establish a contiguous sequence...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the spatiotemporal {{development}} of cerebral oedema in the early stage of severe burn (50 % TBSA, third degree), using a four-dimensional (4 D) mathematical model. Twenty-six male mongrel dogs were randomly divided into control and 6, 12, 18, and 24 post-burn hour (PBH) groups. The manifestation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathology, changes of brain water content, and intracranial pressure were observed in each group respectively. A 4 D mathematical model was established on the basis of the results of MRI scanning. Two turning points (6 and 18 PBH) and three phases of pathological change were displayed by the 4 D mathematical model of cerebral oedema in the early stage of severe burn. The first phase was in the subclinical period, and effective treatment should therefore be performed as quickly as possible in order to prevent deterioration of post-burn cerebral oedema. The second phase (6 - 18 PBH), with pathological characteristics of cytotoxic cerebral oedema, was in the apoptosis period. The third stage (18 - 24 PBH) was the danger period of cerebral oedema. Intracranial pressure increased rapidly owing to the limitation of the cranial cavity. As a result, <b>cerebral</b> <b>hernia</b> could easily occur. An S-shape curve in the pathological process of cerebral oedema occurred in the early post-burn stage following severe burn...|$|E

We investigated the risk factors for AKI including antiedema therapy in acute ischemic stroke patients. The subjects were 129 patients with acute ischemic stroke including 56 females and 73 males {{with a mean age}} 68. 16 ± 12. 29 years. Patients were divided into two groups: patients with AKI and without AKI according to Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria. All patients had undergone cranial, carotid, and vertebral artery evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging. The number of patients with AKI was 14 (10. 9 %). Subjects experiencing atrial fibrillation (P= 0. 043) and higher diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (P= 0. 032) treated with mannitol (P= 0. 019) and furosemide (P= 0. 019) disclosed significant association with AKI. Regression analysis revealed that higher DBP (P= 0. 029) and management with mannitol (P= 0. 044) were the risk factors for AKI. Higher DBP at admission is the most important risk factor for AKI. However antiedema therapy should be used carefully in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Serum creatinine levels or estimated glomerular filtration rate should be watched frequently to prevent AKI.

40|$|A {{limited number}} of {{prenatal}} diagnosis (PND) cases have reported interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 14 involving the 14 q 31 - 32 region. Those cases presented cardiac anomalies, urogenital anomalies, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and mild pyelectasis. We report the PND of a 33 -year-old pregnant woman, who underwent chorionic villus sampling at 12 weeks of gestation after a positive combined 1 st trimester screen. The karyotype revealed a 14 q interstitial deletion. Amniocentesis was performed at 18 weeks of gestation to confirm the deletion and to exclude a confined placental mosaicism and a microarray analysis was performed in order to accurately define the deletion breakpoints. Cytogenetics analysis revealed a karyotype 46,XY,del(14) (q 31 q 32. 2) dn. Microarray analysis allowed to redefined the breakpoints accurate localization and the identification of a ~ 21 Mb deletion (arr[hg 19] 14 q 31. 1 q 32. 31 (79917376 _ 101568230) x 1). At 18 weeks of gestation the fetus presented abnormal fetal biometric parameters (occipitofrontal diameter, cephalic perimeter and abdominal circumference) on ultrasound. After counseling the couple opted for pregnancy termination. The postmorten analysis presented decreased biometry, low weight and low fetal size, facial dysmorphism, clinodactyly, club foot, overlapping fingers and short penis. In internal habitus he presented thymus hypoplasia, bladder hypoplasia, and horseshoe kidneys. The genotype-phenotype correlation in PND pure del(14 q) cases is not well established. Furthermore, to our knowledge, del(14 q) had not been reported {{so early in the}} gestation yet. In this case the positive 1 st trimester screen was related to the inverted ductus venosus and low PAPP-A value. The urogenital anomalies (as horseshoe kidneys) and biometry anomalies are described in the literature. However, to our knowledge, some features of the present case were not seen in other reported cases, for instance clinodactyly, club foot, overlapping fingers, thymus hypoplasia and bladder hypoplasia. Other reports described cardiac and <b>cerebral</b> anomalies, diaphragmatic <b>hernia,</b> and also UPD(14) like phenotypes, which are possibly liked to the 14 q 32 imprinted region. The establishment of a phenotype-genotype correlation is difficult given the size of the deletion, which includes a large number of genes in distinct regions. Nevertheless, this work contributes to a better identification of additional features associated to del(14 q) that can be present in PND. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|A {{trial was}} carried out to study the head and skull {{characteristics}} in a crested chicken breed with <b>cerebral</b> <b>hernia</b> located in a frontal bony protuberance, an uncrested chicken hybrid strain and their relative crosses. Males and females from five genotypes were used: two Padovana breed varieties (two colour plumages: Padovana argentata, silver -PA- and Padovana camosciata, chamois -PC-), the relative cross (PCxPA), a commercial single comb medium-growing strain (Berlanda gaina - B) and the cross between PC and B (PCxB). As regards skull dimensions B showed heavier, longer, and wider skull than Padovana group (P< 0. 001); the cross PCxB had skulls heavier than Padovana purebreds (P< 0. 05). In the Padovana purebreds the frontal bone height varied from 9. 2 to 16. 2 mm, whereas in the groups with B component the height ranged from 4. 2 to 6. 8 mm. The frontal bone height was higher in PC and PCxPA than in PA (P< 0. 01), whereas B and PCxB did not show any bony protuberance. No correlation resulted in Padovana groups between the frontal bone height and the skull length and width. A positive relationship between frontal bone height and skull height was significant only in PCxPA. For the skull characters of PCxPA both the two genotypes seems to be involved and no predominant and relevant effect of only one genotype was seen. The PCxB cross showed relevant differences in the skull morphometry, particularly {{in the absence of}} frontal bony protuberance and in the presence of comb...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose Cerebral venous flow {{obstruction}} (CVFO) is a fatal complication of {{traumatic brain injury}} To compare the outcomes of patients with CVFO secondary to traumatic-brain-injury-induced transsinus fracture who were diagnosed early versus those diagnosed late in the therapeutic course. Methods In total, 403 patients with transsinus fracture were reviewed retrospectively. The patients were divided into an early-diagnosis group (n= 338) and a delayed-diagnosis group (n= 65). The patients submitted to 2 D time-of-flight magnetic resonance venography (2 D-TOF MRV) and/or CT venography (CTV), depending upon the findings of intracranial pressure monitoring, {{in order to identify}} potentially complicated CVFO. These examinations took place within 3 days of the onset of malignant intracranial hypertension symptoms in the early-diagnosis group, and after an average of 7 days in the delayed-diagnosis group. Once diagnosed, patients received intravenous thrombolytic therapy with low-dose urokinase. Patients with massive transsinus epidural hematoma, depressed fracture, or <b>cerebral</b> <b>hernia</b> were treated surgically to relieve the compression and repair any damage to the venous sinuses. Results Cerebral venous {{flow obstruction}} was much more severe in the delayed-diagnosis group than in the early-diagnosis group (p< 0. 001), and hence patients in the former group were given a higher dose of urokinase (p< 0. 001) for thrombolytic therapy. They were also significantly more likely to need surgery (48. 1 % vs. 20. 6 %,p= 0. 003) and had a higher mortality rate (37. 0 % vs. 4. 1 %, p< 0. 001). However, patients in both groups experienced a similarly favorable prognosis, not only with regard to functional outcome but also with respect to neuroradiological improvement, as evaluated by 2 D-TOF MRV/CTV at the final follow-up (p= 0. 218). Conclusions Delayed diagnosis can result in increased risk of surgery and death in the acute phase. Thrombolytic therapy with low-dose urokinase resulted in promising improvements in both functional and neuroradiological outcomes in all of the patients in this study, regardless of the time to diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the {{predictive}} value of Boston Acute Stroke Imaging Scale (BASIS) in acute ischemic stroke in Chinese population. METHODS: This was a retrospective study. 566 patients of acute ischemic stroke {{were classified as}} having a major stroke or minor stroke based on BASIS. We compared short-term outcome (death, occurrence of complications, admission to intensive care unit [ICU] or neurological intensive care unit [NICU]), long-term outcome (death, recurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, modified Rankin scale) and economic index including in-hospital cost and length of hospitalization. Continuous variables were compared by using the Student t test or Kruskal-Wallis test. Categorical variables were tested with the Chi square test. Cox regression analysis was applied to identify whether BASIS was the independent predictive variable of death. RESULTS: During hospitalization, 9 patients (4. 6 %) died in major stroke group while no patients died in minor stroke group (p < 0. 001), 12 patients in the major stroke group and 5 patients in minor stroke group were admitted to ICU/NICU (p = 0. 001). There were more complications (<b>cerebral</b> <b>hernia,</b> pneumonia, urinary tract infection) in major stroke group than minor stroke group (p< 0. 05). Meanwhile, {{the average cost of}} hospitalization in major stroke group was 3, 100 US$ and 1, 740 US$ in minor stroke group (p< 0. 001); the average length of stay in major and minor stroke group was 21. 3 days and 17. 3 days respectively (p< 0. 001). Results of the follow-up showed that 52 patients (26. 7 %) died in major stroke group while 56 patients (15. 1 %) died in minor stroke group (P< 0. 001). 62. 2 % of the patients in major stroke group and 80. 4 % of the patients in minor stroke group were able to live independently (P = 0. 002). The survival analysis showed that patients with major stroke had 80 % higher of risk of death than patients with minor stroke even after adjusting traditional atherosclerotic factors and NIHSS at baseline (HR = 1. 8, 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 3. 1). CONCLUSION: BASIS can predict in-hospital mortality, occurrence of complication, length of stay and hospitalization cost of the acute ischemic stroke patients and can also estimate the long term outcome (death and the dependency). BASIS could and should be used as a dichotomous stroke classification system in the daily practice...|$|E
