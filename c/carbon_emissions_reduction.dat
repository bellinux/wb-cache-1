30|$|Examining the {{reforestation}} scenario {{showed that}} the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> <b>reductions</b> become greater for the scenario with reforestation as the evaluation period is extended, while no <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> <b>reductions</b> were realized for the scenario without reforestation throughout the evaluation period of 100  years, and <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> occurred instead. Reforestation in the forest after harvesting is essential despite {{the differences in the}} energy use scenarios in to achieve <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> <b>reductions.</b> Reviewing the energy use scenario revealed that the starting time of <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> <b>reduction</b> effects varies depending on whether the energy use is actually implemented, even though it does not have as strong an impact on the results as the reforestation scenario. Moreover, a comparison between the scenario with or without reforestation and the scenario with or without energy use revealed the characteristic that <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> <b>reduction</b> effects become greater for the scenario with reforestation as the evaluation period is extended, while a constant level of <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> effects can be expected in both short-term and long-term periods for the scenario with energy use.|$|R
