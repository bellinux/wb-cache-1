5|$|The novel—Grossman's first—was written {{during his}} tenure as a video game designer. The book uses characters, settings, and storylines {{generally}} associated with comic books and superhero fiction, but is written entirely in prose. The story explores how superheroes <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> powers and interact with one another. The potential motivations and perspectives of supervillains are also examined. Grossman's book has been variously described as clever, engaging, and fun—but overstuffed with comic book tropes. An audiobook was released along with the hardcover edition, while a movie has been in development since 2008.|$|E
5|$|Healthy {{pelicans}} {{can usually}} <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> lice, but sick birds may carry hundreds of individuals, which hastens their demise. The pouch louse Piagetiella peralis, which {{occurs in the}} pouch and therefore cannot be removed by preening, is usually not a serious problem, even when present in such numbers that it covers the whole interior of the pouch, but sometimes inflammation and bleeding may harm the host. The brown pelican has a similarly extensive range of parasites. The nematodes Contracaecum multipapillatum and C. mexicanum and the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae have caused illness and mortality in the Puerto Rican population, possibly endangering the pelican on this island. In May 2012, hundreds of Peruvian pelicans {{were reported to have}} perished in Peru from a combination of starvation and roundworm infestation.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81's {{built-in}} RF modulator can output a video {{picture to}} either a UHF 625-line colour or monochrome television (used in the UK, Australia, and most western European countries). France required a slightly {{modified version of the}} machine to match the positive video modulation of SECAM sets, while the USA and Canada required a different ULA chip and modulator to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> 525-line VHF (NTSC) television systems. Both the ZX81 and its predecessor, the ZX80, have a significant drawback {{in the way that they}} handle visual output. Neither machine has enough processing power to run at full speed and simultaneously maintain the screen display. On the ZX80, this means that the screen goes blank every time the machine carries out a computation and causes an irritating flicker whenever a shorter computation – such as processing a keystroke – takes place.|$|E

25|$|Meaning-making through {{spirituality and}} religiosity is {{significant}} because it helps individuals <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> loss, as well as develop their own spiritual or religious beliefs.

25|$|The {{second phase}} {{emphasizes}} {{the aspect of}} skills acquisition and rehearsal that continues from the earlier phase of conceptualization. The client is taught skills that help them <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> stressors. These skills are then practised {{in the space of}} therapy. These skills involve self-regulation, problem-solving, interpersonal communication skills, etc.|$|E

50|$|Sexual {{violence}} and rape are also committed against men during war {{and are often}} under-reported.

25|$|A stroke {{can affect}} the ability to live {{independently}} and with quality. Self-management programs are a special training that educates stroke survivors about stroke and its consequences, helps them acquire skills to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> challenges, and helps them set and meet their own goals during their recovery process. These programs are tailored to the target audience, and lead by someone trained and expert in stroke and its consequences (most commonly professionals, but also stroke survivors and peers). A 2016 review reported that these programs {{improve the quality of}} life after stroke, without negative effects. People with stroke felt more empowered, happy and satisfied with life after participating in this training.|$|E
25|$|Famous labor leader David Hamilton Jackson, made a {{visit to}} Copenhagen in May 1915. He {{successfully}} raised awareness of the growing social desperation on the islands {{and the need for}} to enter the customs territory of the United States in order for the islands to be able to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> economic crisis. After his visit a majority of the Folketing, was convinced that the Danish supremacy of the islands had to end. The First World War had created a new situation: The relations between Germany and the United States were becoming worse {{as a consequence of the}} German submarine warfare, and the Americans were concerned that after an invasion of Denmark the Germans might take control of the islands. This would be unacceptable to the Americans as stated in the Monroe Doctrine.|$|E
25|$|This type {{of therapy}} uses {{a blend of}} cognitive, {{behavioral}} and some humanistic training techniques to target the stressors of the client. This usually is used to help clients better <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> stress or anxiety after stressful events. This is a three-phase process that trains the client to use skills that they already have to better adapt to their current stressors. The first phase is an interview phase that includes psychological testing, client self-monitoring, {{and a variety of}} reading materials. This allows the therapist to individually tailor the training process to the client. Clients learn how to categorize problems into emotion-focused or problem-focused, so that they can better treat their negative situations. This phase ultimately prepares the client to eventually confront and reflect upon their current reactions to stressors, before looking at ways to change their reactions and emotions in relation to their stressors. The focus is conceptualization.|$|E

25|$|Regarding {{locus of}} control, {{there is another}} type of control that entails a mix among the {{internal}} and external types. People that have the combination of the two types of locus of control are often referred to as Bi-locals. People that have Bi-local characteristics are known to handle stress and <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> diseases more efficiently by having the mixture of internal and external locus of control. People that have this mix of loci of control can take personal responsibility for their actions and the consequences thereof while remaining capable of relying upon and having faith in outside resources; these characteristics correspond to {{the internal and external}} loci of control, respectively. An example of this mixed system would be an alcoholic who will accept the fact that he brought the disease upon himself while remaining open to treatment and/or acknowledging that there are people, mainly doctors and therapists, that are trying to cure his/her addiction, and on whom he should rely.|$|E
