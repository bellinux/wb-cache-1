25|$|St Giles {{was unique}} in that food was {{provided}} for children who were getting free education elsewhere. It is also noted that St Giles arranged for seven poor scholars to receive board at the hospital during their term at Norwich School. Accommodations of early medieval hospitals were frequently communal. For example, in St Giles, the master and brothers ate in the common hall while sisters ate by themselves. St Giles hospital was a <b>complex</b> <b>building</b> that housed a community of clergy with cloister and residential accommodation, a hospital and a parish church. St Giles was also wealthy enough to maintain its own kitchen and staff. This allowed poor men to receive a dish of meat, fish, eggs or cheese {{in addition to the}} customary daily ration of bread and drink.|$|E

Indeed, the Egyptian state was still capable of mounting important expeditions to provide building stones for the king's pyramid complex. These expeditions are depicted on unique reliefs found in Unas' causeway and are also referred to in the autobiographical stela of an administration official. This official reports the transport of [...] palmiform columns of red granite from Elephantine to Saqqara in only four days, a feat for which he was praised by the king.

500|$|The {{rapid growth}} {{of the town of}} Barrow-in-Furness, the {{construction}} of the Furness Railway following the discovery of deposits of iron ore in the Furness peninsular, and the development of industries using iron as a raw material resulted in many commissions for the practice. [...] The population of Barrow doubled between 1851 and 1861, and doubled again in the next decade. [...] The major figure {{in the development of the}} town and the railway was James Ramsden (1822–96), who eventually became managing director of the railway, the Barrow Haematite Steel Company, and the Barrow Shipbuilding Company. [...] The largest deposits of iron ore had been discovered in about 1850 by Henry Schneider in land owned by William Cavendish, who was at that time the 2ndEarl of Burlington, and who also played a part in the industry. [...] All three men commissioned the practice to design a variety of buildings. [...] In addition Paley designed a country house, Abbot's Wood (1857–59) for Ramsden, a large and <b>complex</b> <b>building</b> with Gothic and Tudor features.|$|E
500|$|The Scottish Office {{decided to}} procure the {{construction}} work under a [...] "construction management contract", rather than under a Private Finance Initiative, {{in order to}} speed construction, but without properly evaluating the financial risks of doing so, and – in a decision that Fraser stated [...] "beggars belief" [...] – without asking Ministers to approve it. This {{was one of the}} two most flawed decisions which the report singled out, the other was the insistence on a rigid programme. Officials decided that rapid delivery of the new building was to be the priority, but that quality should be maintained. It was therefore inevitable that the cost would suffer. The client was obsessed with early completion and failed to understand the impact on cost and the completion date if high-quality work and a <b>complex</b> <b>building</b> were required. [...] In attempting to achieve early completion, the management contractor produced optimistic programmes, to which the architects were unwise to commit. The main causes of the slippage were delays in designing a challenging project that was to be delivered against a tight timetable using an unusual procurement route.|$|E

2500|$|Florida {{was mostly}} divided between two {{distinct}} culture groups, the Muskogean & the Carib. While {{there were some}} Muskogean tribes along almost the entirety of Florida's east coast, everything else south of Lake Okeechobee was ruled by a Carib nation called the Calusa —Including the Keys. This tribe {{appears to have been}} a powerful trading force in the Caribbean & the chief & his wife were treated almost as if they were a king & queen. They had discovered <b>complex</b> <b>building</b> techniques & built cities of two story communal buildings, as space within the Everglades was scarce. Smaller farming & fishing villages built the more common thatched-roof, stilted huts common amongst the Carib peoples. While they mostly wove their clothing from Spanish moss & made shawls & rugs from dried palm leaves, they also undoubtedly traded for other cloth goods to the north and west, which may have given them access to Hemp [...] & Cotton. The Chief & his wife had their own palace, of sorts, in which they lived & from which they conducted their political business. They were met with the Spanish when they attempted to explore Florida in the 16th century & continued to survive in the region until the mid-18th century, when Spain temporarily lost control of the Florida colony to the English due to the activities of the Creek Confederacy. They were also partially responsible for the mythology surrounding the Fountain of Youth. Later, they conquered some of the other Muskogean peoples—namely the Ais & the Mayaimi [...] (for which the city of Miami is named for, despite the fact that the tribe surrounded Lake Okeechobee), technically making them an Empire, as small as they were. (An Empire is seen as a governing system in which significant populations of different kinds of people with separate cultural identities are ruled over by a single, ultimate ruler).|$|E
