50|$|Four-terminal sensing is {{also known}} as Kelvin sensing, after William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, who invented the Kelvin bridge in 1861 to measure very low {{resistances}} using four-terminal sensing. Each two-wire connection can be called a Kelvin connection. A pair of contacts that is designed to connect a force-and-sense pair to a single terminal or lead simultaneously is called a Kelvin contact. A clip, often a <b>crocodile</b> <b>clip,</b> that connects a force-and-sense pair is called a Kelvin clip.|$|E
50|$|A heat sink, {{such as a}} <b>crocodile</b> <b>clip,</b> can be used {{to prevent}} {{damaging}} heat-sensitive components while hand-soldering. The heat sink limits the temperature of the component body by absorbing and dissipating heat (reducing the thermal resistance between the component and the air), while the thermal resistance of the leads maintains the temperature difference between the part of the leads being soldered and the component body so that the leads become hot enough to melt the solder while the component body remains cooler.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>crocodile</b> <b>clip</b> (also {{alligator}} clip or spring clip) is a sprung metal clip with long, serrated jaws {{which is used}} for creating a temporary electrical connection. This simple mechanical device gets {{its name from the}} resemblance of its jaws to that of an alligator's or crocodile's. It is used to connect an electrical cable to a battery or some other component. Functioning much like a spring-loaded clothespin, the clip's tapered, serrated jaws are forced together by a spring to grip an object. When manufactured for electronics testing and evaluation, one jaw of the clip is typically permanently crimped or soldered to a wire, or is bent to form the inner tubular contact of a ~4 mm female banana jack, enabling quick non-permanent connection between a circuit under test and laboratory equipment or to another electrical circuit. The clip is typically covered by a plastic shroud or [...] "boot" [...] to prevent accidental short-circuits.|$|E
40|$|The current {{education}} system in Malaysia {{has been of}} great concern to the society. The conventional methods of education currently being used do not allow students {{to be actively involved}} in the whole learning process. Many researches were conducted to find the best ways to enhance the quality of education and mostly with the help of technology. This study implemented science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) as an integrated smart learning program for primary school students in Malaysia. A set of developed technologies were introduced to cope with the primary school syllabus. It consisted the heart diagnostic, modern agriculture, smart bicycle, monopoly game, speech technology and <b>crocodile</b> <b>clip.</b> In heart diagnostic, student learned how to capture the electrocardiography (ECG) signals, read the ECG graph, calculate the width of the graph and use mathematics to understand the characteristic of the ECG signals. In another technology that we have developed is named modern agriculture. Heat and water level sensors were used to measure the temperature and the water that is needed for healthy growth of plants. In the science subjects, they know that plants require light in order to secure and they are capable to quantify the amount of light in relationship to the temperature. Using the above concepts, several other technologies which we called smart bicycle, speech technology and <b>crocodile</b> <b>clip</b> software were used as a tools to assist learning for these primary school children. This project was implemented at Sekolah Kebangsaan Taman Universiti 1, Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Eight teen students were selected to participate in the trial. Since the current evaluation system is based on exam oriented learning in order to evaluate the performance of the student. This created stress for teachers and students as the passing percentage of the school reflects the current status of the school as being a top notch or below average standing. In order to address this issue, we developed a monopoly like game based system, where students are actually being evaluated by playing this game. In the game the student has to answer sets of questions as they program in order to win the game. The result showed that the technology integration into the learning process had produced positive influence on the students’ interest towards STEM and thus enhanced their academic performance. Teachers have also becoming more innovative in teaching activities with the aid of technology...|$|E

40|$|In this {{technical}} note the often overlooked issue of electrically connecting screen-printed electrode sensors is considered. The electrical connection of screen-printed electrodes to the potentiostat/electronics {{can be a}} main issue when a true electrochemical response {{is trying to be}} obtained and if one does not have a stable electrical connection, the results that are obtained may lack reproducibility and therefore maybe discredited as "another failed electrochemical probe/analyte". This paper considers the case of electrically connecting screen-printed with <b>crocodile</b> <b>clips</b> and compares that to the use of edge-connectors demonstrating the precise connection of an electrode setup when utilising <b>crocodile</b> <b>clips</b> can result in extremely reproducible electrochemical outputs when applied correctly...|$|R

5000|$|GP Hall (active {{since the}} late '60s) who uses a variety of guitars played with {{implements}} including psaltery bows, palette knives, electric fans and razors, wind-up toys, velcro and <b>crocodile</b> <b>clips</b> (Some of Hall's techniques are similar to Keith Rowe's methods but are applied to a much more melodic compositional and improvisational style) ...|$|R
50|$|A popular way {{to anchor}} {{molecules}} to the electrodes {{is to make}} use of sulfur's high chemical affinity to gold. In these setups, the molecules are synthesized so that sulfur atoms are placed strategically to function as <b>crocodile</b> <b>clips</b> connecting the molecules to the gold electrodes. Though useful, the anchoring is non-specific and thus anchors the molecules randomly to all gold surfaces. Further, the contact resistance is highly dependent on the precise atomic geometry around the site of anchoring and thereby inherently compromises the reproducibility of the connection.|$|R
5000|$|Hall's music {{draws on}} classical, rock, jazz, flamenco, folk and blues styles {{as well as}} free music, {{electronic}} noise and [...] "found" [...] instrumentation.

5000|$|An impromptu {{broadcasting}} station was soon formed and Rutherford College swiftly followed suit. A {{surprising number of}} students were willing to have their radios modified. This involved soldering two wires across the volume control - the other ends being connected to the radiator and table lamp with small <b>crocodile</b> <b>clips.</b> The broadcasts were legal because they were an audio feed, not a radio broadcast. The stations became known as Audio Eliot and Audio Rutherford and soon achieved fame in the national press. The stations combined forces under the name Audio Rutherford and overcame safety {{issues raised by the}} University Surveyor which had threatened closure.|$|R
5000|$|Circuit bending {{an audio}} device {{typically}} involves removing the rear {{panel of the}} device and connecting any two circuit locations with a [...] "jumper" [...] wire, sending current {{from one part of}} the circuit into another. Results are monitored through either the device's internal speaker or by connecting an amplifier to the speaker output. If an interesting effect is achieved, this connection would be marked for future reference or kept active by either soldering a new connection or bridging it with <b>crocodile</b> <b>clips.</b> Often other components are inserted at these points such as pushbuttons or switches, to turn the effect on or off; or components such as resistors or capacitors, to change the quality of the audio output. This is repeated on a trial and error basis. Other components added into the circuit can give the performer more expressiveness, such as potentiometers, photoresistors (for reaction to light) and pressure sensors.|$|R
50|$|He {{quickly found}} a {{signalling}} relay that {{although it was}} de-energised (known as 'down' in railway signalling speak), there was nevertheless a voltage across a normally closed contact (known as a 'back contact' in railway signalling speak), indicating that the contact was faulty. As a temporary measure to get the trains moving, he shorted out the contact {{with a piece of}} wire terminated in two <b>crocodile</b> <b>clips.</b> The engineer was mindful {{of the fact that he}} had substantially shortened the overlap distance of the signal. When he arrived back at the station he instructed the platform staff to hold every train for one minute after the signal turned green. He then went in search of a second wire with the intention of temporarily connecting the faulty contact to an unused contact on the same relay restoring normal operation. It was while he was searching that the collision took place just outside Charing Cross station.|$|R
