In both cases, the actors were motivated by the Wahhabi interpretation of Islam, which prohibits the building of monuments on graves.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket, a <b>century</b> <b>is</b> a score of 100 or more runs in a single innings by a batsman. [...] The term is also {{included}} in [...] "century partnership" [...] which occurs when two batsmen add 100 runs to the team total when they are batting together. A <b>century</b> <b>is</b> regarded as a landmark score for batsmen and a player's number of <b>centuries</b> <b>is</b> generally recorded in his career statistics. Scoring a <b>century</b> <b>is</b> loosely equivalent in merit to a bowler taking five wickets in an innings, and is {{commonly referred to as}} a ton or hundred. Scores of more than 200 runs are still statistically counted as a century, although these scores are referred as double (200–299 runs), triple (300–399 runs), and quadruple centuries (400–499 runs), and so on.|$|R
