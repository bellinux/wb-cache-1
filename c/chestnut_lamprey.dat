50|$|The <b>chestnut</b> <b>lamprey</b> (Ichthyomyzon castaneus) is {{a species}} of lamprey.|$|E
50|$|The {{range of}} the <b>chestnut</b> <b>lamprey</b> extends from Lake Winnipeg and the Hudson Bay down the Mississippi River to the Central and Eastern United States; this {{includes}} any large lakes or reservoirs where large host fish are present. In Canada, the <b>chestnut</b> <b>lamprey</b> {{has been found in}} Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec.|$|E
5000|$|Northern pike, walleye, channel catfish, whitefish, lake trout, {{sturgeon}} (catch {{and release}} only), <b>chestnut</b> <b>lamprey</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>chestnut</b> <b>lamprey</b> has {{a maximum}} length of around 345 mm, 325 mm in Canada, with dark grey to olive skin color, blue-black after spawning, and with {{five to eight}} {{bicuspid}} laterals around its mouth.|$|E
50|$|The {{river is}} also very fishable. A large number of species inhabit the river, among them: sunfishes (largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, rock bass bluegill, crappie, pumpkinseed, and warmouth), bowfin, brown bullhead, minnows (common carp, chub, dace, and shiner), suckers (white sucker and redhorse), perches (yellow perch, walleye, darter), brook stickleback, {{northern}} pike, longnose gar, trout (brown trout, brook trout, and rainbow trout), and lampreys (American brook lamprey and <b>chestnut</b> <b>lamprey).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{river is}} a part of a {{proposed}} United Nations World Heritage Site to protect the large intact area of wilderness along Lake Winnipeg and in northwestern Ontario. This wilderness river {{is one of the few}} rivers in southern Canada that is still very pristine and clean, with little or no development along the shoreline and in the entire watershed. There are no major mines, roads, hydro, or logging areas in the region. The area provides an essential habitat for a segment of the threatened woodland caribou, and also protects habitat for the <b>chestnut</b> <b>lamprey,</b> a species of special concern. Numerous archaeological sites and pictographs exist, helping to demonstrate that the area has long been of special significance to First Nations.|$|E
5000|$|Adults are {{parasitic}} {{and feed}} on larger {{species of fish}} to support their body. It was widely presumed that this fish did not feed during the winter, but recent research in Wisconsin has revealed some lampreys remain attached to their host during the winter months; one fisherman caught a sturgeon with a <b>chestnut</b> <b>lamprey</b> still attached. [...] Observation of this species has revealed that they are primarily a nocturnal animal and they seek out shade during daylight. These lampreys may be beneficial to the rivers and lakes, due to their natural control of local fish populations. [...] Human populations can pose threats to these animals through pollution, siltation, and dredging. Larval lamprey that must filter feed for numerous years and are vulnerable to changes in their environment during this time. For instance, larval lampreys will perish if large particulate regularly blocks their mouths because they are filters.|$|E
5000|$|During the egg {{stage of}} the lamprey's life, it is most {{vulnerable}} to predators that prefer to eat fish eggs. Predation by other fish helps keep the lamprey numbers under control. When the lamprey has hatched from its egg into the larvae stage, it is limited to pools or backwater areas with a sand or sandy mud bottom. The young lampreys filter feed for food for around {{five to seven years}} until they are large enough to attach themselves to a host species. [...] Spawning of this species of lamprey occurs from June to July when the animals are around seven to nine years old and migrate to tributaries to protect the young from predators, though most spawning activity has been observed in mid-June. During the mating process, one female would begin moving rocks from a suitable area for eggs; afterward she attaches herself to a rock while hopeful males attach to her and stroke her tail attempting to mate. The eggs are then covered with a rock, presumably to shade the young lampreys at birth and to keep any predators from devouring the young. [...] As with most lampreys, the <b>chestnut</b> <b>lamprey</b> only mates once during its entire life and dies shortly after.|$|E
40|$|Several ancient {{fish species}} have {{inhabited}} the Missouri River {{and its tributaries}} {{for thousands of years}} prior to major mainstem modifications and fragmentation. However post-anthropogenic modifications, populations of these ancient fish species have been highly diminished. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} use historic and current ichthyological records to determine the past and present status for <b>Chestnut</b> <b>Lamprey</b> Ichthyomyzon castaneus, Silver Lamprey Ichthyomyzon unicuspis, Bowfin Amia calva, American Eel Anguilla rostrata, and Burbot Lota lota. Currently, these species are rarely captured and perhaps extirpated from Nebraska waters...|$|E
