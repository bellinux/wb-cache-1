25|$|The primary {{methods for}} {{controlling}} wind-excited sways are {{to increase the}} stiffness, or increase damping with tuned/active mass dampers. To a design by Arup, its fully triangulated perimeter structure makes the building sufficiently stiff without any extra reinforcements. Despite its overall <b>curved</b> <b>glass</b> shape, {{there is only one}} piece of <b>curved</b> <b>glass</b> on the building, the lens-shaped cap at the apex.|$|E
25|$|The {{ground floor}} of the edifice still got the large <b>curved</b> <b>glass</b> {{openings}} designed for exhibiting machines. First floor windows are framed with delicate ornamentation and scrollwork, especially the larger one on the right, with its early Art Nouveau tympanon motifs inside the triangular pediment.|$|E
25|$|Several {{spectacular}} {{projects have}} created considerable attention but remained unexecuted, {{such as a}} conference centre in Östersund, Jämtland, {{on the top of}} a mountain, called Breath of Life. Features developed in these experimental projects do occasionally return in built projects later, such as the <b>curved</b> <b>glass</b> facade that is realized in the shopping mall Emporia in Malmö 2011.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, Lane {{produced}} Threshold, {{commissioned by}} the Mint Museum in Charlotte, North Carolina. Coloured glass objects arranged behind the <b>curving</b> <b>glass</b> wall were backlit to produce numerous shifting reflections, while the title Threshold directly references Lane’s interest in the metaphysical experience of art.|$|R

Further work followed during 1991-93 across China, Spain and London and Edinburgh in the United Kingdom, including Wave Wall (1993) for Dalian Glass Company, China, which saw Lane experimenting with <b>curving</b> <b>glass</b> walls that refract light.|$|R
25|$|The bubble top on the KR200 was {{simplified}} {{over that}} of the KR175 {{by the use of}} a larger <b>curved</b> <b>glass</b> windshield that formed A-pillars with the side window frames. This allowed the bubble to be simpler and more compact than the KR175 bubble, and it was consequently easier and less expensive to produce. The windshield wiper, manual on the KR175, was electric on the KR200.|$|E
25|$|Above {{ground there}} is little sign of the vast interior: two <b>curved</b> <b>glass</b> {{canopies}} at {{the east and west}} ends of the station cover the entrances and allow daylight into the ticket hall below. The Jubilee Park, a public park is situated between the two canopies, above the station concourse. It had originally been intended that the infilled section of the dock would be reinstated above the station, but this proved impractical because of technical difficulties and the park was created instead.|$|E
25|$|This {{was part}} of a broader fear of spirits that might flit into dwellings. Witch bottles were common {{throughout}} Europe – bottles or glass spheres containing a mass of threads, often with charms entangled in them. Its purpose was to draw in and trap evil and negative energy directed at its owner. Folk magic contends that the witch bottle protects against evil spirits and magical attack, and counteracts spells cast by witches, also forestalling the passage into habitations of witches flying about at night. A witch ball was much the same; however, a more light-hearted belief was that the witch saw her distorted face in the <b>curved</b> <b>glass</b> and was frightened away. The term witch ball is probably a corruption of watch ball because it was used as a guard against evil spirits.|$|E

This complex occupies the site of the former Haus Vaterland, and its principal building, which for a few years was the headquarters of the large German trade union ver.di (Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft, meaning United Services Union), rises to 45 metres and has a <b>curving</b> <b>glass</b> facade designed to evoke the shape of that erstwhile landmark.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} commonly {{designed as}} the softly <b>curving</b> <b>glass</b> skin integrates eight sloping megacolumns that follow a lyrical line connecting the centers and corners {{of all four}} elevations. These curving megacolumns increase the structure’s response to seismic concerns and are integral to both the gravity and lateral systems. They are effective in increasing the stiffness of the building’s perimeter frame, consequently attracting a larger portion of the seismic forces {{in compliance with the}} Chinese code requirements.|$|R
25|$|The new Panorama boasted a {{completely}} new front, featuring a slight peak overhang above the windscreen (which was now optionally undivided), a small grill {{at the bottom of}} the front panel, and for the first time double headlights. Embassy bodies on underfloor-engined chassis shared some or all of these features, depending on the entrance position. However, because the standard offering in the underfloor-engined sector was now the Panorama, most Embassy bodies were built on lightweight front-engined chassis - particularly the Thames 570E and Bedford SB. In this form, with the entrance behind the front axle, the Embassy retained the dished oval grill and wrap-around windscreen of the Consort IV. The rear of both Panorama and Embassy comprised a two-piece <b>curved</b> <b>glass</b> window that wrapped around to meet the rearmost side pillars, and the lights were contained in a single unit with a fin-like top rather like the rear of the Ford Anglia 105E saloon.|$|E
25|$|Simeon Simpson's son Alexander Simpson, who {{was then}} owner of the company, {{decided he wanted to}} find a 'window' for Simpson clothes in the heart of London. He founded Simpsons of Piccadilly when the Geological Museum had closed and the site to be auctioned. The new {{building}} was designed by architect Joseph Emberton as a new and revolutionary retail establishment, the shop front windows exhibited the first <b>curved</b> <b>glass</b> display in Great Britain and the largest in the world at the time, these were designed so that no reflection would be cast to obscure the displays inside. The outstanding feature of the shop's interior was the travertine staircase that ran up through the centre of the store lit by a continuous window up the height of the building. The current lighting structure suspended through the staircase centre is the original from the 1930s as the building has since become a listed building.|$|E

[...] Clark Interiors, a subsidiary of Clark Construction, and Davis Carter Scott designed the Finnegan offices (which are contained on floors five through 11). [...] A grand staircase surrounded by a <b>curved</b> <b>glass</b> wall extends to all floors. Among the other building features constructed were a cafeteria, computer repair facility, data center, kitchen, mailroom, meeting rooms, offices, reception area, and videotaping facility.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Tubular light guides {{transport}} daylight into internal windowless {{parts in}} buildings via multi-reflections on highly reflective surface. They consist of roof dome of glass or transparent plastics, metal hollow core light pipe with mirrored internal surfaces and ceiling cover from diffusive glass which scatters daylight into interior. The investigation of light effi-ciency {{of these new}} systems of tubular light guides needs correct data of transmittance of transparent roof domes and ceiling covers of these systems. Angular transmittance of <b>curved</b> <b>glasses</b> and glasses with pattern are not available. A method for de-termination of angular transmittance of transparent components of light guides was set up. The method is based illuminance measurements within an experimental box with glass samples. 1...|$|R

500|$|The {{tower is}} topped by the 1930 [...] {{diameter}} Chance Brothers lantern, painted white. The lantern cylindrical wall {{is made of}} six bolted cast iron panels. These support a continuous band of <b>curved</b> <b>glass</b> with cast iron glazing bars, and a small catwalk between {{the wall and the}} glazing. The cupola on top of the lantern is made of sheet copper, painted red, and it is topped by ball vent and a wind vane. An access ladder and safety rails, installed in 1990, provide access to the cupola. In the center of the lantern is the VRB-25 apparatus, mounted on steel box.|$|E
500|$|A {{reflector}} sight or {{reflex sight}} is an optical device {{that allows the}} user to look through a partially reflecting glass element and see an illuminated projection of an aiming point or some other image superimposed {{on the field of}} view. These sights work on the simple optical principle that anything at the focus of a lens or curved mirror (such as an illuminated reticle) will look like it is {{sitting in front of the}} viewer at infinity. Reflector sights employ some sort of [...] "reflector" [...] to allow the viewer to see the infinity image and the field of view at the same time, either by bouncing the image created by lens off a slanted glass plate, or by using a mostly clear <b>curved</b> <b>glass</b> reflector that images the reticle while the viewer looks through the reflector. Since the reticle is at infinity it stays in alignment with the device the sight is attached to regardless of the viewer's eye position, removing most of the parallax and other sighting errors found in simple sighting devices.|$|E

Exner saw the design detail (also being experimented with by some Italian manufacturers) and made it his own by enlarging the fins and making them a more prominent feature. Exner believed in the aerodynamic benefits of the fins and even used wind tunnel testing at the University of Michigan — but he also liked their visual effects on the car. They were showcased on the first cars designed under his full supervision for sale: the 1955 Chrysler 300 series, and the Imperial. The hardtop versions of 1957 Chrysler Corporation cars also featured compound <b>curved</b> <b>glass,</b> {{the first to be}} used in a production car.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} is a flat-sided Warren girder structure, plywood covered {{apart from}} the <b>curved</b> <b>glass</b> fibre rear decking. [...] Wing attachment involves some aluminium fittings. The single seat cockpit is ahead of the wing leading edge under a single piece canopy. [...] All 460 series aircraft use a fixed, unsprung monowheel main undercarriage. [...] On the first four prototypes at least, this was mounted below the fuselage in a fairing which exposed only {{the edge of the}} wheel. [...] On the 463s, the wheel is unfaired but assisted by an integral skid. [...] The 465s have no skid and the wheel mounting is instead raised into the fuselage. [...] All have a tail bumper with a [...] "roller skate" [...] tailwheel.|$|E
2500|$|The first Daimler limousines to be {{delivered}} after the war went to embassies and consulates in Europe and to the Lieutenant-Governors of Jersey and Guernsey. [...] These were Straight-Eights built largely from pre-war stock. The first post-war model was the Eighteen, a development of the pre-war Fifteen using the Scout Car's 2.5L engine with a new high-compression cylinder head. The model used <b>curved</b> <b>glass</b> in its side windows which were framed by chromed metal channels instead of the thick pillars that were usual at the time. [...] Because of ongoing restrictions on steel, many of the Eighteen's body panels were made from aluminium. The first post-war Lanchester, the Ten, looked like an enlarged Ford Prefect and its body {{was made in the}} same factory, Briggs Motor Bodies on the Ford site at Dagenham.|$|E
