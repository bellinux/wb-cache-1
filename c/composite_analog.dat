50|$|The D-2 format {{system from}} Sony and Ampex soon {{followed}} two years later, using composite video {{in order to}} lower the bandwidth needed. This reduced D-2's price tag to half that of D-1. Since D-2 was composite digital as opposed to component, it could easily be dropped into the space and infrastructure of <b>composite</b> <b>analog</b> machines presently used at the time (2-inch Quadruplex, 1-inch Type C and 3/4-inch U-Matic). Since less information was recorded on D-2 than on D-1, tape speed could be reduced and hold a maximum of 208 minutes compared to D-1's 94 minutes. However, D-2 was still a compromise, being composite video.|$|E

50|$|Separating RGB color signals into luma and {{chrominance}} {{allows the}} bandwidth of each {{to be determined}} separately. Typically, the chrominance bandwidth is reduced in <b>analog</b> <b>composite</b> video by reducing the bandwidth of a modulated color subcarrier, and in digital systems by chroma subsampling.|$|R
5000|$|In the NTSC system, if the luma is sampled at 13.5 MHz, {{then this}} means that the Cr and Cb signals will each be sampled at 3.375 MHz, which {{corresponds}} to a maximum Nyquist bandwidth of 1.6875 MHz, whereas traditional [...] "high-end broadcast analog NTSC encoder" [...] would have a Nyquist bandwidth of 1.5 MHz and 0.5 MHz for the I/Q channels. However, in most equipment, especially cheap TV sets and VHS/Betamax VCR's the chroma channels have only the 0.5 MHz bandwidth for both Cr and Cb (or equivalently for I/Q).

50|$|A keel-shaped needle with a {{titanium}} electrode layer rides {{in the groove}} with extremely light tracking force (65 mg) and an electronic circuit is formed through the disc and stylus. Like an audio turntable, the stylus reads the disc, starting at the outer edge and going towards the center. The video and audio signals are stored on the Videodiscs in a <b>composite</b> <b>analog</b> signal which is encoded into vertical undulations {{in the bottom of}} the groove, somewhat like pits. These undulations have a shorter wavelength than the length of the stylus tip in the groove, and the stylus rides over them; the varying distance between the stylus tip and the conductive surface due to the depth of the undulations in the groove under the stylus directly controls the capacitance between the stylus and the conductive carbon-loaded PVC disc. This varying capacitance in turn alters the frequency of a resonant circuit, producing an FM electrical signal which is then decoded into video and audio signals by the player's electronics.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Failure {{to achieve}} stable {{fixation}} with medial support in proximal humeral fractures {{can result in}} varus malalignment and cut-through of the proximal screws. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the influence of an intramedullary fibula bone graft on the biomechanical properties of proximal humeral fractures stabilized by angular stable plate fixation in a bone model under cyclic loading. METHODS: Two fixation techniques were tested in 20 <b>composite</b> <b>analog</b> humeri models. In group F- (n = 10), fractures were fixed by an anatomically formed locking plate system. In group F+ (n = 10), the same fixation system was used with an additional fibular graft model with a length of 6 cm inserted in an intramedullary manner. Active abduction was simulated for 400 cycles by use of a recently established testing setup. Fragment gap distance was measured, and thereby, intercyclic motion, fragment migration, and residual plastic deformation were determined. RESULTS: The addition of a fibular graft to the fixation plate led to 5 times lower intercyclic motion, 2 times lower fragment migration, and 2 times less residual plastic deformation. Neither screw pullout, cut-through, nor implant failure was observed. CONCLUSION: Medial support with an intramedullary fibular graft in an angular stable fixation of the proximal humerus in vitro increases overall stiffness of the bone-implant construct and reduces migration of the humeral head fragment. This technique might provide a useful tool in the treatment of displaced proximal humeral fractures, especially when there is medial comminution...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the load to failure of COs with extra-articular oblique osteotomies (OOs) as well as modified, extra-articular step osteotomies (SOs). METHODS These three osteotomies and their subsequent fixation utilizing a standardized tension band wiring technique were tested in 42 <b>composite</b> <b>analog</b> ulnae models at 20 Â° and 70 Â° of flexion. Triceps loading was simulated with a servo hydraulic testing machine. All specimens were isometrically loaded until failure. Kinematic and force data, as well as interfragmentary motion were recorded. RESULTS At 70 Â°, CO failed at a mean load of 963 N (SD 104 N), the OO at 1512 N (SD 208 N) and the SO at 1484 N (SD 153 N), (P< 0. 001). At 20 Â°, CO failed at a mean load of 707 N (SD 104 N) and OO at 1009 N (SD 85 N) (P= 0. 006). The highest load to failure was observed for the SO, which was 1277 N (SD 172 N). The load to failure of the SO was significantly higher than the CO as well as the OO. CONCLUSION Extra-articular osteotomies showed a significantly higher load to failure in comparison to traditional CO. At near full extension (20 Â° of flexion), this biomechanical advantage was further enhanced by a step-cut modification of the extra-articular oblique osteotomy...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{concrete}} {{extensions of}} the Standard Model valid up to high energies are presented. Starting from the scenario of Vectorlike Confinement, we perform a systematic search of renormalizable models, where Dark Matter candidates arise as composite particles of a new confining gauge interaction. In particular we investigate the possibility that Dark Matter is made by <b>composite</b> states <b>analog</b> to the QCD baryons and stable thanks to an accidental symmetry, exactly as the proton is stable thanks to the baryon number conservation. The lightest state charged under this U(1) symmetry is neutral, so that our scenario may explain in a simple way both stability and neutrality of Dark Matter. Cosmology suggests that the Dark Matter thermal relic abundance can be reproduced if the mass scale of these states is around 100 TeV. We show that, despite its high mass, composite Dark Matter is characterized by an interesting phenomenology, with observable electric and magnetic dipole moments leading to a peculiar spin-independent cross section. The electric dipole moment of the Dark Matter candidate arises exactly as the neutron electric dipole and it is proportional to a CP-violating coupling induced by the theta-angle of the new strong sector. In some theories, a Majorana Dark Matter can appear, with challenging spin-dependent cross section or inelastic scatterings. Each model predicts also a set of lighter <b>composite</b> states, <b>analog</b> to the pions in QCD, possibly accessible at colliders. The possibility that the Dark Matter abundance in the Universe is made by a scalar <b>composite</b> particle <b>analog</b> to pions in QCD is also investigated. This possibility {{turns out to be}} less theoretically motivated, but it is interesting from a phenological point of view: Dark Matter may show up at collider not directly but through LHC signatures from unstable particles of the same composite sector. Finally, we extend the Vectorlike Confinement scenario introducing fundamental scalars with the aim of generating a composite sector that includes a composite Higgs. The partial compositeness mechanism arises automatically from our Lagrangian where fundamental Yukawa couplings between the new particles and the Standard Model fermions are allowed. Despite being aware that the idea of introducing fundamental scalars is unconventional and gives rise to many theoretical problems, we argue that this seems to be unavoidable if we want to construct a fundamental theory of composite Higgs with partial compositeness. Under certain assumptions on the dynamics of the scalars, successful models can be realized thanks {{to the fact that the}} Standard Model fermions quantum numbers admit a minimal enough â€œsquare root"...|$|R
50|$|Preserving {{the color}} framing {{sequence}} of video across edits and between channels in video effects {{was an important}} issue in early <b>analog</b> <b>composite</b> videotape editing systems, as cuts between different color sequences would cause jumps in subcarrier phase, and mixing two signals of different field dominance would result in color artifacts {{on the part of}} the signal that was not in sync with the output color frame sequence.|$|R

40|$|Recently the LHCb {{collaboration}} {{reported evidence}} for direct CP violation in charm decays. The value is sufficiently large that either substantially enhanced Standard Model contributions or non-Standard Model physics {{is required to}} explain it. In the latter case {{only a limited number}} of possibilities would be consistent with other existing flavor-changing constraints. We show that warped extra dimensional models that explain the quark spectrum through flavor anarchy can naturally give rise to contributions of the size required to explain the the LHCb result. The D meson asymmetry arises through a sizable CP-violating contribution to a chromomagnetic dipole operator. This happens naturally without introducing inconsistencies with existing constraints in the up quark sector. We discuss some subtleties in the loop calculation that are similar to those in Higgs to Î³Î³. Loop-induced dipole operators in warped scenarios and their <b>composite</b> <b>analogs</b> exhibit non-trivial dependence on the Higgs profile, with the contributions monotonically decreasing when the Higgs is pushed away from the IR brane. We show that the size of the dipole operator quickly saturates as the Higgs profile approaches the IR brane, implying small dependence on the precise details of the Higgs profile when it is quasi IR localized. We also explain why the calculation of the coefficient of the lowest dimension 5 D operator is guaranteed to be finite. This is true not only in the charm sector but also with other radiative processes such as electric dipole moments, b to sÎ³, Ïµ'/Ïµ_K and Î¼ to eÎ³. We furthermore discuss the interpretation of this contribution within the framework of partial compositeness in four dimensions and highlight some qualitative differences between the generic result of composite models and that obtained for dynamics that reproduces the warped scenario.

40|$|In the {{generation}} of static reservoir models, {{it is common to}} apply quantitative information derived from outcrop analogs, especially in techniques for well correlation and stochastic modeling. Sand-body well correlations can be guided by reference to â€˜correlabilityâ€™ models, which quantify the likelihood of correlation of sand-bodies across well arrays, based on analog sand-body width distributions. Pixel-based geostatistical simulations of reservoir architecture can be conditioned by indicator variograms that are parameterized using empirical relationships based on geologic properties, whereas objectbased reservoir models are commonly constrained using analog data on the geometry of sedimentary units. Through application of such geostatistical techniques, analog information also enables the construction of training images for conditioning reservoir models based on multi-point statistics. This study applies these techniques to model large-scale fluvial architecture of extensively exposed outcrops of various successions, as constrained by data from outcrops of analog successions. A typical subsurface workflow has been replicated, the aim being to test the value and limitations of the methods mentioned above, and {{to assess the impact of}} analog choice in workflows involving their use. Vertical â€˜dummyâ€™ wells (minimum spacing = 50 m) were placed across outcrop architectural panels representing km-wide exposed sections; the intervening architecture was predicted by correlability models and geostatistical simulations, constrained on outcrop-analog data drawn from an architectural database (FAKTS). The relevant FAKTS output was filtered to obtain <b>composite</b> <b>analogs</b> that match with the outcrop successions being modeled in terms of key system parameters (e. g. river discharge regime) and architectural properties (e. g. net-to-gross ratio). The value of the predictive methods was assessed by quantifying the degree of match between forecasted and known outcrop architecture, in terms of channel-complex correlability and static connectivity. Comparisons of correlability and geostatistical models vs. outcrop observations highlight the effectiveness of the different methods and demonstrate the influence of well density on the confidence assigned to predictions. Results support modeling approaches based on the use of a varied range of analogs as a way to consider uncertainty in analog choice, and on alternative modeling methods to account for potential algorithm-related pitfalls...|$|R
