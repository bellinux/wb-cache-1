Thus, the hedger {{is more likely to}} call the note, reducing the expected duration of the note. In this situation, the hedger has to partially unwind the hedges done at the inception of the PRDC note. For example, the hedge would have to pay swaps in the foreign currency. If FX spot moves in a correlated fashion with the foreign <b>currency</b> <b>swap</b> <b>rate</b> (that is, foreign <b>currency</b> <b>swap</b> <b>rate</b> increases as FX spot increases), the hedger would need to pay a higher <b>swap</b> <b>rate</b> as FX spot goes up, and receive a lower <b>swap</b> <b>rate</b> as FX spot goes down.

40|$|In our {{paper we}} present the most {{important}} characteristics of the forint interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> market, as well as examine the determinants and the information content of the forint interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> spreads. The turnover of the forint interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> market has grown dynamically in recent years, and now it may reach, or even exceed, the turnover of the government bond market. Due to the hedging activity of interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> market makers, there is a close linkage between the forint interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> market and the government bond market. In terms of investors, the interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> and government bond markets are strongly segmented. Consequently, the spillover from one market segment to the other is not perfect. Our analyses suggest that long-term forint interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> spreads {{are exposed to the}} common impact of several factors. The strongest effects are attributed to government bond purchases by residents, the Maggie A spread, the slope of the yield curve and the forint/euro forward yield spread. In the developments of swap spreads, the impact of those trading strategies employing interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> can be detected. These are widespread in the domestic market, as is confirmed by anecdotal information. The results indicate that in certain cases the swap yields, while at other times the government bond yields carry additional information about long-term yield expectations.

Since {{the inception of}} the swap market in 1981, the outstanding notional principal of interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> has reached a level of $ 12. 81 trillion in 1995.

In a global economy, given the floating exchange rate regime, nonfinancial firms face economic exposure in the presence of foreign competition. Asymmetric information about economic exposure leads to mispricing of the firms' debt, and the firm chooses either short-term or long-term debt to minimize the cost of debt. We show that when there is a favorable (unfavorable) exchange rate shock, an exposed firm chooses short-term (long-term) debt together with fixed-for-floating (floating-for-fixed) interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps.</b> Given interest <b>rate</b> expectations, interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> enable the firm to minimize the cost of fixed or floating rate debt.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} {{of foreign exchange}} (FX) swaps {{as a source of}} funding and as a hedging tool has focused attention {{on the role of the}} FX swap market in the recent crisis. The turbulence in international money markets spilled over into the FX swap market in the second-half of 2007 and into 2008, giving rise to concerns over the ability of banks to roll over their funding requirements and manage their liquidity risk. The turmoil also raised questions about banks'' ability to continue their supply of credit to the local economy, as well as the external financing gap it could create. In this paper, we examine the channels through which FX swap transactions could affect a country''s financial and economic stability, and highlight the strategies central banks can employ to mitigate market pressures. While not offering any judgment on the instrument itself, we show that the use of FX swaps for funding and hedging purposes is not infallible, especially during periods of market stress.
