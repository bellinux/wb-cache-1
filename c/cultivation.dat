5|$|Agriculture is the {{dominant}} source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the <b>cultivation</b> of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the last century. After {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1865, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the <b>cultivation</b> of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual <b>cultivation</b> obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers.|$|E

5|$|Possibly {{the first}} {{published}} {{information on the}} <b>cultivation</b> of Dryandra appeared in the magazine Australian Plants in June and September 1961. D.sessilis was among the species treated, but as there was not yet any experimental data on <b>cultivation,</b> information was restricted to its aesthetic qualities and the soil in which it naturally occurs.|$|E

30|$|Interestingly, {{photobioreactor}} <b>cultivations</b> of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6714 showed fourfold higher average specific {{growth rate}} {{when compared to}} shake flask <b>cultivations.</b> This observation is likely due to well-defined conditions in the photobioreactor compared to uncontrolled shake flask <b>cultivations.</b> It {{has been shown that}} under controlled conditions, growth rates and biomass concentration can be improved in microalgae <b>cultivations</b> (García-Malea et al. 2009; Ugwu et al. 2008). This underlines the importance of defined conditions to obtain highly productive processes (Pruvost et al. 2011). It has been shown biomass and lipid productivity in microalgae can be improved significantly under defined conditions of a photobioreactor.|$|R

5|$|Banksia verticillata {{is seldom}} seen in <b>cultivation.</b> The natural growing {{conditions}} {{point to a}} sunny aspect and good drainage as being important in <b>cultivation.</b> It is good for coastal situations and erosion control. Very sensitive to dieback, B. verticillata (like most other western Australian banksias) perishes quickly in humid conditions or poor drainage. It has been grafted successfully onto Banksia integrifolia. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 49 days to germinate.|$|E
40|$|The purpose o f {{the paper}} is to {{determine}} the legal principles o f the coexistence of genetically modified, organic, and conventional <b>cultivations,</b> with special regard to the requirements o f ascertaining the consumers access to a differentiated range o f agricultural produce, and the natural environment protection. The coexistence o f conventional, organic and genetically modified <b>cultivations</b> means that they are practically, and without prejudice, capable o f functioning alongside one another. The legal norms that regulate the coexistence o f such <b>cultivations</b> are o f a technical nature. Legislations o f some EU member states, including that o f Italy, place the burden of ascertaining a non-collision coexistence o f <b>cultivations</b> on those who engage in the GMO production. As experience o f some states engaged in GMO <b>cultivations</b> shows, even the best regulations o f the technical aspects o f the coexistence o f GMO <b>cultivations</b> with conventional or ecological ones do not provide an adequate and sufficient cover to protect the latter from unintentional pollution with genetically modified material that is happening in the course o f natural processes undergoing in the nature.

5|$|Compared to {{most other}} {{important}} crops, {{little is known}} about the domestication, dispersal and <b>cultivation</b> history of the cowpea. Although there is no archaeological evidence for early cowpea <b>cultivation</b> the centre of diversity of the cultivated cowpea is West Africa, leading an early consensus that this is the likely centre of origin and place of early domestication. New research using molecular markers has suggested that domestication may have instead occurred in East Africa and currently both theories carry equal weight.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, a study {{conducted}} by , UC Davis, US Forest Service, and the Hoopa Tribe showed that fishers in California were exposed to and killed by anticoagulant rodenticides associated with marijuana <b>cultivation.</b> In this study, 79% of fishers that were tested in California were exposed to an average of 1.61 different anticoagulant rodenticides and four fishers died directly attributed to these toxicants. A 2015 follow-up study building on this data determined that the trend of exposure and mortality from these toxicants increased to 85%, that California fishers were now exposed to an average of 1.73 different anticoagulant rodenticides, and that nine more fishers died, bringing the total to 13. The extent of marijuana <b>cultivation</b> within fishers' home ranges was highlighted in a 2013 study focusing on fisher survival and impacts from marijuana <b>cultivation</b> within the Sierra National Forest. Research showed that fishers had an average of 5.3 individual grow sites within their home range. One fisher had 16 individual grow sites within its territory.|$|E
