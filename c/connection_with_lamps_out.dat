The concert took place in RTI studios, which was illuminated <b>with</b> <b>lamps</b> made <b>out</b> of 810 bottles of detergent and softeners, a large velvet heart, a tree made of tires and plastic caps, and CDs that served as a framework on the steps.

60|$|I entered, shuddering. This {{woman was}} very terrible. Within the {{curtains}} was a recess, about twelve feet by ten, {{and in the}} recess was a couch and a table whereon stood fruit and sparkling water. By it, at its end, was a vessel like a font cut in carved stone, also full of pure water. The place was softly lit <b>with</b> <b>lamps</b> formed <b>out</b> of the beautiful vessels of which I have spoken, and the air and curtains were laden with a subtle perfume. Perfume too seemed to emanate from the glorious hair and white-clinging vestments of She herself. I entered the little room, and there stood uncertain.|$|R
60|$|I stood <b>with</b> my <b>lamp</b> held <b>out</b> {{over the}} stair-rail, {{and he came}} slowly within its light. It was a shaded lamp, to shine upon a book, and its circle of light was very contracted; {{so that he was}} in it for a mere instant, and then out of it. In the instant, I had seen a face that was strange to me, looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched and pleased by the sight of me.|$|R

Poor lost souls, wailing for a crust in the dark, we know full well our helplessness and ignominy. And well may we repeat after a stricken brother over-seas: [...] "Our pride it is to know no spur of pride."

40|$|Local {{electric}} {{stimulation of}} tissues and cells has gained importance as therapeutic alternative {{in the treatment}} of many diseases. These alternatives aim to deliver a less invasively stimuli in liquid media, making imperative the development of versatile micro- and nanoscale solutions for wireless actuation. Here, a simple microfabrication process to produce suspended silicon microphotodiodes that can be activated by visible light to generate local photocurrents in their surrounding medium is presented. Electrical characterization using electrical probes confirms their diode behavior. To demonstrate their electrochemical performance, an indirect test is implemented in solution through photoelectrochemical reactions controlled by a white-LED lamp. Furthermore, their effects on biological systems are observed in vitro using mouse primary neurons in which the suspended microphotodiodes are activated periodically <b>with</b> white-LED <b>lamp,</b> bringing <b>out</b> observable morphological changes in neuronal processes. The results demonstrate a simplified and cost-effective wireless tool for photovoltaic current generation in liquid media at the microscale.

5000|$|These admit of {{classification}} according to period and locality, the finer work, as {{in so many}} other branches of Christian art, being as a rule the earlier (see e.g. Leclercq, [...] "Manuel d'archeologie chretienne" [...] II, 557 seq.). Of the great metal chandeliers with their [...] "dolphins" [...] —i.e. little arms wrought in that shape and supporting a lamp— which came into vogue with {{the freedom of the}} Church in the days of Constantine, something has already been said under the heading Candlesticks. Such [...] "polycandela" [...] long remained a conspicuous feature of Byzantine worship. For the <b>connection</b> of <b>lamps</b> <b>with</b> the liturgy at an earlier age it may be sufficient to quote a few sentences from a homily of the Syrian Narsai, who died A.D. 512, descriptive of the Liturgy. [...] "The priests," [...] he says, [...] "are still, and the deacons stand in silence, the whole people is quiet and still, subdued and calm. The altar stands crowned with beauty and splendor, and upon it is the Gospel of life and the adorable wood the cross. The mysteries are set in order, the censers are smoking, the lamps are shining and the deacons are hovering and brandishing fans in likeness of watchers" [...] (Conolly [...] "Liturgical Homilies of Narsai", p. 12).|$|R
