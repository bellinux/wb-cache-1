500|$|In 1978, Jackson starred as Scarecrow in {{the film}} musical The Wiz. The musical scores were {{arranged}} by Quincy Jones, who formed a partnership with Jackson during the film's production and agreed to produce the singer's solo album Off the Wall. Jackson was dedicated to the role, and watched videotapes of gazelles, cheetahs and panthers {{in order to learn}} graceful movements for his part. Jones recalled working with Jackson as one of his favorite experiences from The Wiz, and spoke of Jackson's dedication to his role, comparing his acting style to Sammy Davis, Jr. Critics panned The Wiz upon its October 1978 release. Jackson's performance as the Scarecrow was one of the only positively reviewed elements of the film, with critics noting that Jackson possessed [...] "genuine acting talent" [...] and [...] "provided the only genuinely memorable moments." [...] Of the results of the film, Jackson stated: [...] "I don't think it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>any</b> better, I really don't". In 1980, Jackson stated that his time working on The Wiz was [...] "my greatest experience so far...I'll never forget that".|$|E
500|$|... "Bad" [...] was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} duet between Jackson and musician Prince. Other artists {{that were supposed to}} be featured on the album included Diana Ross, Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin and Barbra Streisand, but none of those collaborations ended up happening. The song was viewed as a revived [...] "Hit the Road, Jack" [...] progression with lyrics that pertain to 'boasting'. [...] "Dirty Diana" [...] was viewed by AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine as [...] "misogynistic" [...] and its lyrics, describing a sexual predator, do not aim for the [...] "darkness" [...] of [...] "Billie Jean", instead sounding equally intrigued by and apprehensive of a sexual challenge, while having the opportunity to accept or resist it. [...] "Leave Me Alone" [...] was described as being a [...] "paranoid anthem". [...] "Man in the Mirror" [...] was seen as Jackson going [...] "a step further" [...] and offering [...] "a straightforward homily of personal commitment", which {{can be seen in the}} lyrics, [...] "I'm starting with the man in the mirror/I'm asking him to change his ways/And no message <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>any</b> clearer/If you wanna make the world a better place/Take a look at yourself and then make a change." [...] The lyrics to [...] "Speed Demon" [...] are about driving fast.|$|E

[...] Of the results of the film, Jackson stated: [...] "I don't think it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>any</b> better, I really don't." [...] In 1980, Jackson stated that his time working on The Wiz was [...] "my greatest experience so far [...] [...] [...] I'll never forget that." [...] The film received a positive critique for its elaborate set design, and the book American Jewish Filmmakers noted that it [...] "features some of the most imaginative adaptations of New York locales since the glory days of the Astaire-Rogers films." [...] In a 2004 review of the film, Christopher Null wrote positively of Ted Ross and Richard Pryor's performances. However, Null's overall review of the film was critical, and he wrote that other than the song [...] "Ease on Down the Road", [...] "the rest is an acid trip of bad dancing, garish sets, and a Joel Schumacher-scripted mess that runs 135 agonizing minutes." [...] A 2005 piece by Hank Stuever in The Washington Post described the film as [...] "a rather appreciable delight, even when it's a mess", and felt that the singing – especially Diana Ross's – was [...] "a marvel".|$|E

500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded [...] "Earthling" [...] with a B. Unlike Isler, the A.V. Club {{reviewer}} {{loved the}} opening, calling it [...] "one of Fringes most effective freak-meets". Murray continued {{that he believed}} the episode to be [...] "an efficient action/adventure/horror hour, heavy on suspenseful moments and neat effects, light on character development and progress on the master-plot. When {{all is said and}} done and Fringe eventually ends its run, I'm betting that a newcomer will be able to skip 'Earthling' without putting a dent in their overall understanding of the show. But that doesn't mean it wasn't still cool to see people get reduced to dust right in front of our eyes. Jane Boursaw from AOL TV responded negatively to the episode, wishing it had not been yet another [...] "stand-alone creature feature". While praising the special effects, Boursaw expressed disinterest in learning more about Broyles and compared the Fringe case to something already done in The X-Files. She concluded, [...] "Take the creepy alien factor out of it, and this <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>any</b> other police procedural". UGO Networks reviewer Alex Zalben also noted similarities to The X-Files, writing that [...] "the reason [...] is weird for Fringe is that, aforementioned evidence aside, they’ve been very careful to avoid the overarching alien mythology X-Files is famous for. Oops." ...|$|E

2500|$|As a Catholic apologist of the {{religious}} and political status quo, Barruel downplayed his own Catholicism and presented himself as a neutral party within the radicalized debate surrounding the Revolution. [...] His tactic was to cite document after document with a commentary that effectively showed it was the truth. The reader of the Memoirs <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>any</b> individual who doubted some of Barruels inferences, but who would eventually be overwhelmed by the sheer weight of evidence against the Enlightenment and liberation movements. His fanatical hatred for revolutionary and enlightenment ideas is hidden behind a faux neutrality and casuistic slight of pen. By isolating single passages and quoting them out of context, Barruel presented {{what seemed to be}} a convincing case. He made up for quality with quantity and persuaded a number of contemporaries to adopt his view. The Memoirs is constructed according to reason and Barruel attempts to use the Enlightenments own tool to bring about its demise.|$|E
