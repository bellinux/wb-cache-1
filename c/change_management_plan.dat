40|$|South East Queensland (SEQ) has {{experienced}} voracious {{growth over the}} past five decades. Spanning some 200 km, this sprawling subtropical coastal conurbation is beginning to reach its ecological and socio-political limits. Over the last decade there have been concerted efforts to manage this growth with a new regime of plans and policies, but climate change has significantly complicated the challenge. This paper offers a preliminary analysis of the situation. The major climate adaptation challenges for the region are identified, including: rising sea levels, storm surges, higher temperatures, and increased freshwater scarcity. These will impact most on the elderly, sick and disadvantaged who have lower levels of resilience. The key plans and policies that address these issues are then reviewed, including: ClimateQ; the SEQ Regional Plan; and, the Draft SEQ Climate <b>Change</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Plan.</b> The overall planning regime is appraised in light of five core themes of strong ecological modernisation (technological innovation; engaging with economic imperatives; political and institutional change; transforming the role of social movements and discursive change) and the principles of environmental justice.

40|$|With their {{information}} technology (IT) investments, most organizations focus on implementing the technology {{rather than on}} realizing the expected business benefits. Consequently, benefits are not forthcoming, despite a project's technical success. Drawing on more than 10 years of research studying how organizations can improve the return on their IT investments, we present an approach for identifying, planning, and managing the delivery of benefits. Our benefits management approach begins with IT professionals and business managers together answering seven questions about a potential IT investment. These questions aim to uncover three {{important aspects of the}} investment: the ends (the target performance improvements), the ways (the ways the business must work differently), and the means (the enabling IT capabilities). With these answers, the team can build a cause-effect network [...] called the Benefits Dependency Network (BDN) [...] which shows how each of the improvements can be achieved by a combination of business changes and new IT capabilities. It also makes clear who needs to become accountable for making the specific changes and delivering the benefits. The completed network provides the basis for developing both a robust business case for the investment and a viable <b>change</b> <b>management</b> <b>plan</b> to deliver the benefits. The results are better investment decisions and benefits-driven implementation plans, both of which lead to realizing more benefits from IT investments...|$|E
40|$|For many years, {{the tight}} bureaucratic and task {{centered}} approaches of civil service institutions of Ethiopia led to fragmentation, overlap and duplications of efforts than being responsive, flexible and customer focus. To this end, Business Process Reengineering (BPR) {{has been considered}} as a government sector technique to help organizations fundamentally rethink how they do their work in order to dramatically improve customer service, cut operational costs, become responsive, flexible and customer focus. BPR has great potential for increasing productivity through reduced process time and cost, improved quality, and greater customer satisfaction, but it often requires a fundamental organizational change. Despite the numerous advantages of BPR in terms of responsiveness, flexibility and customer focus, its implementation {{is perceived to be}} a difficult task and also many unsuccessful experiences {{have been reported in the}} literature. In fact, there are very few survey researches that attempt to highlight the kinds of activities that the organizations should pursue to ensure a reasonable transition to the new process; manage the human and technical issues surrounding implementation of the new process; and assess the results of its reengineering efforts. But these researchers saw the issues from private cooperative organizational perspectives and contexts. Besides, most of the discussions and findings were stretched up to showing that successful BPR implementations process are mainly associated with the organizations capability in managing changes. The researches paid no attention to other factors, like the issues of enabler, tools and techniques which can be utilized to build momentum. Hence, the present research investigated the factors associated with successful implementations of BPR projects in the contexts of public institutions. Based on a case study conducted in Ethiopian Ministry of Health and Gambella Regional Health Bureau; this research attempted to provide guidelines and best practices in public service providing institutions that will help them to achieve dramatic performance gains while implementing BPR projects. A cross sectional, qualitative and quantitative study was conducted taking 90 respondents and 20 interviewees as study subjects. Data were collected from June 1 to July 31 2010. A structured questionnaire was filled by 90 respondents where 43. 3 % of them from Gambella Peoples’ National Regional State Health Bureau and 56. 7 % of them were from Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health. The questionnaire was employed to collect data on change management and factors associated with the attainment of performance goals whereas in-depth interviews were utilized to substantiate the findings of questionnaire and investigate the use of information technology as enabler. The in-depth interviews included planners, core process owners and directors. Cross tabulation results imply that there is significant associations between attainment of performance goals and availability of written comprehensive plan for pilot test, refinement and implementation of <b>change</b> <b>management</b> <b>plan,</b> availability of communication strategy, placement of performance measures, motivation to take new roles and responsibilities, Use of information technology as enabler and pilot testing to evaluate new process. Hence, the findings of this research suggest that reengineering project implementation is complex, involving many factors. To succeed, it is essential that change be managed and that balanced attention be paid to all identified factors, including those that are more contextual (e. g., management support and technological competence), performance management, availability of comprehensive implementation plan, communication strategies, refinement and implementation of <b>change</b> <b>management</b> <b>plan,</b> use of pilot testing to evaluate new process, motivation to take new roles and responsibilities and usage information technology as enabler. + 251911436197, Gambella, Ethiopia, P. o. box. 9...|$|E

While these {{projects have been}} helpful for students 2 ̆ 7 social formation, only a few have been institutionalized by the service-learning client. This paper assesses the factors that account for {{the success or failure}} of these service-learning activities. Underlying the analysis is a framework for understanding the role of universities and service-learning in promoting these innovations as well as a more general framework for managing social innovations. The findings of this paper are based on five case studies of service-learning that promote innovations for inclusive development undertaken at the Ateneo de Manila University. Data gathering for these case studies involved interviews, focus group discussions, and surveys with various stakeholders including clients, students, faculty and intermediaries. The paper finds that there are at least two sets of elements that account for {{the success or failure of}} service-learning projects that promote innovations for inclusive development. First, there is a need for universities to work with an entity that has a long-term commitment to seeing the innovation through and which has a clear strategic and <b>change</b> <b>management</b> <b>plan.</b> Service-learning projects that were not as successful involved innovations introduced by the university or involved working with external entities that were not committed to these innovations. The committed entity also has the responsibility for parcelling out the service-learning projects in a way that fits the academic calendar and piece together outputs that may span across various academic terms. Expectations between this committed entity and the university must also be clear. Second, the study shows that there are elements internal to the university that could account for the success or failure of attempts to promote innovations for inclusive development through service-learning. These include faculty characteristics, student characteristics, course design, internal expectation setting, and institutional support. The study ends with recommendations that can help make service-learning more effective in promoting innovations for inclusive development...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} the application and utility of improvisation, a technique that offers room for experimentation and generates uncertainty to trigger creative thinking and change management capability. A case study of a change management training program for professors of a university is used to elaborate on the principles of Improv and demonstrate how the tool can be effectively integrated into change management training, especially at the beginning of the initiative, when new ideas need to be accepted and firmed up. Design/ methodology/ approach: The case was change management training program for 20 professors of a leading technical university in India. The university commissioned one of the authors to conduct a change management program to prepare their professors for change. Even though the changes were to be introduced in a phased manner, there was an apprehension of collective opposition to the change initiative if a buy-in was not created among the professors. The training mandate was therefore to create among participants a readiness for change. The training program used Improv games in conjunction with the Change Wheel (Kanter, 2011) for creating a mindset conducive to change management and planning how to bring about systemic change at the university. Findings- Using Improv games participants were made to identify and confront their mental blocks and anxieties to accepting and implementing change. Further, instead of being dismissed or criticized, their concerns were creatively deployed to realistically assess the method of managing change. Improv games “Word Ball” “Yes And” and “Yes But” when incorporated into the change management workshop offered creative and interesting ways to explore multiple organizational and employee mind-set issues that could have hampered the change management efforts. The games were able to bring about openness to change and in turn an ability to accept and explore new possibilities that participants were earlier closed to. This, coupled with a conceptual framework of the Change Wheel, group decision-making and an ownership-based approach resulted in the participants jointly creating a <b>change</b> <b>management</b> <b>plan</b> for the university. Research limitations / implications: The case is limited to the Improv games used in the change management training program that initiated a change management process currently underway in the university. Practical implications: Improv games helped elicit greater cooperation and enthusiastic participation from participants thereby creating a positive attitude towards organizational change efforts that are otherwise viewed with consternation. It was able to channelize communication from morale-dampening speculation into effective dialogue around the process of change management to be adopted. The participants left the program with increased confidence about their ability to implement the action plan and felt uniquely valued and appreciated for their contributions during the workshop. Originality/ value: This paper elucidates how Improv games can be used in a change management program and describes its utility and versatility in enhancing training effectiveness. For Change Management consultants and trainers the method of usage of the games can come in handy in enhancing participant involvement, effectively eliciting ideas and in co-creating workable action plans with employees who are well versed with their workplace reality.

40|$|The Swedish {{public health}} care {{organisation}} {{could very well}} be undergoing its most significant change since its specialisation during the late 19 th and early 20 th century. At the heart of this change is a move from using manual patient journals to electronic health records (EHR). EHR are complex integrated organisational wide information systems (IS) that promise great benefits and value as well as presenting great challenges to the organisation. The Swedish public health care is not the first organisation to implement integrated IS, and by no means alone in their quest for realising the potential benefits and value that it has to offer. As organisations invest in IS they embark on a journey of value-creation and capture. A journey where a costbased approach towards their IS-investments is replaced with a value-centric focus, and where the main challenges lie in the practical day-to-day task of finding ways to intertwine technology, people and business processes. This has however proven to be a problematic task. The problematic situation arises from a shift of perspective regarding how to manage IS in order to gain value. This is a shift from technology delivery to benefits delivery; from an ISimplementation plan to a <b>change</b> <b>management</b> <b>plan.</b> The shift gives rise to challenges related to the inability of IS and the elusiveness of value. As a response to these challenges the field of IS-benefits management has emerged offering a framework and a process in order to better understand and formalise benefits realisation activities. In this thesis the benefits realisation efforts of three Swedish hospitals within the same county council are studied. The thesis focuses on the participants of benefits analysis projects; their perceptions, judgments, negotiations and descriptions of potential benefits. The purpose is to address the process where organisations seek to identify which potential IS-benefits to pursue and realise, this in order to better understand what affects the process, so that realisation actions of potential IS-benefits could be supported. A qualitative case study research design is adopted and provides a framework for sample selection, data collection, and data analysis. It also provides a framework for discussions of validity, reliability and generalizability. Findings displayed a benefits fluctuation, which showed that participants’ perception of what constituted potential benefits and value changed throughout the formal benefits management process. Issues like structure, knowledge, expectation and experience affected perception differently, and this in the end changed the amount and composition of potential benefits and value. Five dimensions of benefits judgment were identified and used by participants when finding accommodations of potential benefits and value to pursue. Identified dimensions affected participants’ perceptions, which in turn affected the amount and composition of potential benefits. During the formal benefits management process participants shifted between judgment dimensions. These movements emerged through debates and interactions between participants. Judgments based on what was perceived as expected due to one’s role and perceived best for the organisation as a whole were the two dominant benefits judgment dimensions. A benefits negotiation was identified. Negotiations were divided into two main categories, rational and irrational, depending on participants’ drive when initiating and participating in negotiations. In each category three different types of negotiations were identified having different characteristics and generating different outcomes. There was also a benefits negotiation process identified that displayed management challenges corresponding to its five phases. A discrepancy was also found between how IS-benefits are spoken of and how actions of IS benefits realisation are understood. This was a discrepancy between an evaluation and a realisation focus towards IS value creation. An evaluation focus described IS-benefits as well-defined and measurable effects and a realisation focus spoke of establishing and managing an on-going place of value creation. The notion of valuescape was introduced in order to describe and support the understanding of IS value creation. Valuescape corresponded to a realisation focus and outlined a value configuration consisting of activities, logic, structure, drivers and role of IS...|$|E

One year prior to the 2015 deadline, approximately half of all primary clinics have not implemented a basic EHR system. The purpose of this phenomenology study was to explore rural primary care physicians and physician assistants’ experiences regarding overcoming barriers to implementing EHRs. Complex adaptive systems formed the conceptual framework for this study. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews with a purposeful sample of 21 physicians and physician assistants across 2 rural PCPs in the southeastern region of Missouri. Participant perceptions were elicited regarding overcoming barriers to implementing EHRs systems as manadated by federal legislation.

30|$|This study {{demonstrates}} how training {{and use of}} POCUS significantly affects the clinical management and diagnosis of patients in the marginalized region of the Sierra Madre {{in the state of}} Chiapas, Mexico. The 584 total scans recorded is a larger sample size than other similar studies since the population was followed for over 12  months. The 34 % of patient encounters in which POCUS changed the clinical diagnosis likely prevented delays in care and expedited referral and hospitalization as needed without having to wait for a patient to obtain imaging at another site. In this study, ultrasound <b>changed</b> the <b>management</b> <b>plan</b> in 30 % of patients. Although this is lower than the findings in Rwanda, which was a hospital based study with higher acuity patients, it shows the significant effect of POCUS in the resource limited primary care clinic based setting. As reported in previous ultrasound studies on inpatients, the remainder of the patients for which POCUS did not <b>change</b> diagnosis or <b>management</b> still benefit from a scan that can confirm a clinical diagnosis and reinforce the current <b>management</b> <b>plan</b> [2].|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Over {{the last}} decade, {{utilization}} of ultrasound technology by non-radiologist physicians has grown. Recent advances in affordability, durability, and portability have brought ultrasound {{to the forefront}} as a sustainable and high impact technology for use in developing world clinical settings as well. However, ultrasound's impact on patient <b>management</b> <b>plans,</b> program sustainability, and which ultrasound applications are useful in this setting has not been well studied. Methods Ultrasound services were introduced at two rural Rwandan district hospitals affiliated with Partners in Health, a US nongovernmental organization. Data sheets for each ultrasound scan performed during routine clinical care were collected and analyzed to determine patient demographics, which ultrasound applications were most frequently used, and whether {{the use of the}} ultrasound <b>changed</b> patient <b>management</b> <b>plans.</b> Ultrasound scans performed by the local physicians during the post-training period were reviewed for accuracy of interpretation and image quality by an ultrasound fellowship trained emergency medicine physician from the United States who was blinded to the original interpretation. Results Adult women appeared to benefit most from the presence of ultrasound services. Of the 345 scans performed during the study period, obstetrical scanning was the most frequently used application. Evaluation of gestational age, fetal head position, and placental positioning were the most common findings. However, other applications used included abdominal, cardiac, renal, pleural, procedural guidance, and vascular ultrasounds. Ultrasound <b>changed</b> patient <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> in 43 % of total patients scanned. The most common change was to plan a surgical procedure. The ultrasound program appears sustainable; local staff performed 245 ultrasound scans in the 11 weeks after the departure of the ultrasound instructor. Post-training scan review showed the concordance rate of interpretation between the Rwandese physicians and the ultrasound-trained quality review physicians was 96 %. Conclusion We suggest ultrasound is a useful modality that particularly benefits women's health and obstetrical care in the developing world. Ultrasound services significantly impact patient <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> especially with regards to potential surgical interventions. After an initial training period, it appears that an ultrasound program led by local health care providers is sustainable and lead to accurate diagnoses in a rural international setting. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. We {{evaluated}} {{the value of}} Gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI in the preoperative staging of colorectal cancer and estimated the clinical impact of liver MRI in the <b>management</b> <b>plan</b> of liver metastasis. Methods. We identified 108 patients who underwent PET/CT and liver MRI as preoperative evaluation of colorectal cancer, between January 2011 and December 2013. We {{evaluated the}} per nodule sensitivity of PET/CT and liver MRI for liver metastasis. <b>Management</b> <b>plan</b> <b>changes</b> were estimated for patients with metastatic nodules newly detected on liver MRI, to assess the clinical impact. Results. We enrolled 131 metastatic nodules (mean size 1. 6 [*]cm) in 41 patients (mean age 65 years). The per nodule sensitivities of PET/CT and liver MRI were both 100 % for nodules measuring 2 [*]cm or larger but were significantly different for nodules measuring less than 2 [*]cm (59. 8 % and 95. 1 %, resp., P= 0. 0001). At least one more metastatic nodule was detected on MRI in 16 patients. Among these, 7 patients indicated <b>changes</b> of <b>management</b> <b>plan</b> after performing MRI. Conclusions. Gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI detected more metastatic nodules compared with PET/CT, especially for small (< 2 [*]cm) nodules. The newly detected nodules induced <b>management</b> <b>plan</b> <b>change</b> in 43. 8 % (7 / 16) of patients...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{possibly}} {{the greatest threat}} facing human society in this century. The response to this challenge {{has been dominated by}} international negotiations for controlling greenhouse gas emissions. More recently there are efforts by the international community to engage other levels of governance in mitigation and adaptation response. While the framework for international action on climate change continues to evolve, there is mounting pressure from researchers to include cities as significant actors in the global climate <b>change</b> <b>management</b> strategy. Cities are centers of production and consumption in our society and as such will be crucial for global climate <b>change</b> <b>management</b> strategy. Despite these links, demands for consideration of climate <b>change</b> <b>management</b> issues in local policy making have remained a research rhetoric and have not yet translated into planning action. This gap between planning research and practice is probably due to lack of evidence based research on this issue. This study fills in this gap and provides empirical evidence supporting the key role of local development <b>plans</b> in climate <b>change</b> <b>management.</b> Specifically, in the first step, this research investigates the influence of local development plans on climate change mitigation by comparing change in carbon dioxide emissions in groups of cities with and without <b>plans.</b> Thereafter, climate <b>change</b> <b>management</b> capacity in local development plans is analyzed through policy analysis. Finally, this research study examines the effect of plan quality on the change in carbon dioxide emissions, while controlling for socio-economic, landscape and policy characteristics. Results of this study support the demands for using local development plans as tools for climate <b>change</b> <b>management.</b> This study identifies numerous planning policies in local development plans with potential to influence climate <b>change</b> <b>management.</b> The analysis also reveals wide variation in the quality of the climate <b>change</b> <b>management</b> policies. For example, policies related to site planning regulations and transportation are fairly detailed, whereas acquisition and incentive/disincentive tools are not. The detailed review of plan quality suggests that although development plans have the potential to significantly influence climate change, there is need for further improvement, especially of the overall plan implementation capacity. Finally, the research findings show that the quality of climate <b>change</b> <b>management</b> <b>planning</b> policies in local development plans {{have a significant impact on}} a communities? emissions. Communities with better plan quality had significantly lower increase in per-capita emissions over the period of analysis. The study also discovered significant effects of wealth, travel behavior, occupation base and state policy on the change in emissions. Based on the research findings this study recommends evolving integrated local development policies that focus on dual goals of climate <b>change</b> <b>management</b> and sustainable development. Further studies are recommended to examine the opportunities and challenges to use of local development <b>plans</b> for climate <b>change</b> <b>management...</b>|$|R
