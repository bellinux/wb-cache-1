The average yield of mast cells after 2 wk was 7. 3 million cells per fetus at a purity of 96 %. These fetal skin-derived <b>cultured</b> mast <b>cells</b> increased their histamine content in a time-dependent manner to 3. 6 pg per cell after 2 wk and 6. 7 pg per cell after 4 wk. Phenotypic analyses revealed much greater expression of CD 49 b and CD 81 and lesser expression of CD 77 and CD 102 on fetal skin-derived <b>cultured</b> mast <b>cells</b> as compared with bone marrow-derived <b>cultured</b> mast <b>cells.</b> These findings suggest a close similarity between fetal skin-derived <b>cultured</b> mast <b>cells</b> and freshly isolated cutaneous mast cells. Connective tissue mast cell characteristics of fetal skin-derived <b>cultured</b> mast <b>cells</b> were evidenced by: (1) their greater histamine content than bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells; (2) the presence of heparin; and (3) their degranulation in response to compound 48 / 80 and substance P. Importantly, fetal skin-derived <b>cultured</b> mast <b>cells</b> secreted greater amounts of interleukin- 13 but much less MIP- 1 β and interleukin- 6 than bone marrow-derived <b>cultured</b> mast <b>cells</b> in response to ionomycin.

25|$|Generally it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that the kMTs fiber (the bundle of microtubules bound to the kinetochore) is originated by the capture of MTs polymerized at the centrosomes and spindle poles in mammalian <b>cultured</b> <b>cells.</b> However, MTs directly polymerized at kinetochores might also contribute significantly. The {{manner in which the}} centromeric region or kinetochore initiates the formation of kMTs and the frequency at which this happens are important questions, because this mechanism may contribute not only to the initial formation of kMTs, but also {{to the way in which}} kinetochores correct defective anchoring of MTs and regulate the movement along kMTs.|$|E
25|$|For {{partially}} complementary microRNAs to recognise their targets, nucleotides 2–7 of the miRNA (its 'seed region') must {{be perfectly}} complementary. Animal miRNAs inhibit protein {{translation of the}} target mRNA (this is present but less common in plants). Partially complementary microRNAs can also speed up deadenylation, causing mRNAs to be degraded sooner. While degradation of miRNA-targeted mRNA is well documented, whether or not translational repression is accomplished through mRNA degradation, translational inhibition, {{or a combination of}} the two is hotly debated. Recent work on miR-430 in zebrafish, as well as on bantam-miRNA and miR-9 in Drosophila <b>cultured</b> <b>cells,</b> shows that translational repression is caused by the disruption of translation initiation, independent of mRNA deadenylation.|$|E
40|$|The subunit {{pattern of}} immunopurified {{cytochrome}} c oxidase from <b>cultured</b> mouse <b>cells</b> and mature tissues {{of the mouse}} was investigated by electrophoretic analysis.

In this study, using highly enriched (> 95 %) Langerhans cells from murine epidermis obtained by the panning method, we investigated whether murine Langerhans cells express CD 23.

2500|$|Most {{chromosome}} {{movements in}} relation to spindle poles are associated to lengthening and shortening of kMTs. One {{of the most interesting}} features of kinetochores is their capacity to modify the state of their associated kMTs (around 20) from a depolymerization state at their (+) end to polymerization state. This allows the kinetochores from cells at prometaphase to show [...] "directional instability", changing between persistent phases of movement towards the pole (poleward) or inversed (anti-poleward), which are coupled with alternating states of kMTs depolymerization and polymerization, respectively. This kinetochore bi-stability seem {{to be part of a}} mechanism to align the chromosomes at the equator of the spindle without losing the mechanic connection between kinetochores and spindle poles. It is thought that kinetochore bi-stability is based upon the dynamic instability of the kMTs (+) end, and it is partially controlled by the tension present at the kinetochore. In mammalian <b>cultured</b> <b>cells,</b> a low tension at kinetochores promotes change towards kMTs depolymerization, and high tension promotes change towards kMTs polymerization.|$|E
