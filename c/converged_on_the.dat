5|$|In March 2012, {{hundreds}} of anti-nuclear demonstrators <b>converged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Australian headquarters of global mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. The 500-strong march through southern Melbourne {{called for an}} end to uranium mining in Australia, and included speeches and performances by representatives of the expatriate Japanese community as well as Australia's Indigenous communities, who are concerned about the effects of uranium mining near tribal lands. There were also events in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|The Parallax Correctors {{were needed}} because the turrets were located {{hundreds}} of feet from the director. There was one for each turret, and each had the turret/director distance manually set in. They automatically received Relative Target Bearing (bearing from own ship's bow), and Target Range. They corrected the bearing order for each turret so that all rounds fired in a salvo <b>converged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same point.|$|E
5|$|To the east, McKenney and Major William Whistler {{organized}} another force. Whistler {{had about}} 100 regulars from Fort Howard, along with 50 mostly métis militiamen from Green Bay, 60 New York Indians, and 120 Menominees. On August 29, Atkinson's force began {{moving up the}} Wisconsin River towards Portage, Wisconsin, where the hostile Ho-Chunks had concentrated, while Whistler's force <b>converged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same location from the north.|$|E

5|$|Around 1821, the Zulu general Mzilikazi of the Khumalo clan {{successfully}} {{rebelled against}} King Shaka and created his own clan, the Ndebele. The Ndebele fought their way northwards into the Transvaal, {{leaving a trail}} of destruction in their wake and beginning an era of widespread devastation known as the Mfecane. When Dutch trekboers <b>converged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Transvaal in 1836, they drove the tribe even further northward. By 1838, the Rozwi Empire, along with the other smaller Shona states were conquered by the Ndebele and reduced to vassaldom.|$|E
5|$|Swimming animals {{including}} fish such as herrings, {{marine mammals}} such as dolphins, and ichthyosaurs (of the Mesozoic) all <b>converged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same streamlined shape. The fusiform bodyshape (a tube tapered at both ends) adopted by many aquatic animals is an adaptation {{to enable them}} to travel at high speed in a high drag environment. Similar body shapes are found in the earless seals and the eared seals: they still have four legs, but these are strongly modified for swimming.|$|E
5|$|Tiberias was {{captured}} by two squadrons of light horse, one from the 3rd Light Horse Brigade supported by armoured cars, and one from the 4th Light Horse Brigade after fighting the Battle of Samakh. The two squadrons <b>converged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> town from the north–west and south respectively and took 100 prisoners. The remainder of the garrison retreated northwards to form a rearguard at Lake Hule with the survivors from the Samakh garrison. The next day the Australian Mounted Division and the 5th Cavalry Division pursued the Ottoman forces towards Damascus, paralleling the pursuit on the inland route begun by the 4th Cavalry Division a day earlier.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the afternoon, nearly 300armed men had <b>converged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lawn of the State Capitol. Brooks' men {{seized the}} state arsenal and began turning the Statehouse into an armed camp. Telegrams covered in {{signatures}} were sent to President Ulysses S. Grant supporting Brooks as the legal governor. Three out of the five Supreme Court justices also telegraphed the President in support of Brooks. Brooks telegraphed the President himself asking for access to weapons housed at the federal arsenal. He also issued a statement to the press proclaiming himself governor. The senators from the state, Clayton and Steven Dorsey, met with President Grant, and they sent a message to Brooks giving their support.|$|E
5|$|Diederichs {{requested}} reinforcements from Germany, and the Kaiser authorized {{a second}} Division to deploy to the East Asia station. The unit was therefore reorganized as the East Asia Squadron; Prinzess Wilhelm {{was assigned to}} the I Division of the Squadron. On 27 November, Diederichs was promoted to Vice Admiral for his success in seizing Kiaochou, and given command of the new Squadron. Chinese forces <b>converged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> port {{by the end of the}} month. Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser moved into the harbor to provide artillery support. General Chang, who had been placed under house arrest, was discovered to have been attempting to subvert the German occupation; Dierderichs therefore placed him under arrest aboard Prinzess Wilhelm. A brief skirmish ensued, which quickly resulted in a Chinese rout. On 8 January, a force of 50 men from Prinzess Wilhelms crew was sent to Chi-mo to defend against Chinese raids in the area.|$|E
5|$|As soon as Michael {{learned of}} the fall of Amisos, he ordered a huge force to be {{assembled}} (al-Tabari gives its size at 50,000 men) under his uncle Petronas, the Domestic of the Schools, and Nasar, the stratēgos of the Bucellarian Theme. Al-Tabari records that the Emperor himself assumed command of these forces, but this is not supported by Byzantine sources. Given the bias against Michael by the historians writing during the Macedonian dynasty, this may be a deliberate omission. The forces assembled came from all over the Byzantine Empire. Three separate armies were formed and <b>converged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Arabs: a northern Byzantine force composed of the forces from the Black Sea themes of the Armeniacs, Bucellarians, Koloneia and Paphlagonia; a southern force, probably the one that had already fought at the Bishop's Meadow and had kept shadowing the Arab army, composed from the Anatolic, Opsician and Cappadocian themes, as well as the kleisourai (frontier districts) of Seleukeia and Charsianon; and the western force, under Petronas himself, comprising the men of the Macedonian, Thracian and Thracesian themes and of the imperial tagmata from the capital.|$|E

5|$|On 22 August 1796, Charles and Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, {{encountered}} Bernadotte's {{division at}} Neumarkt. The outnumbered French were driven north west through Altdorf bei Nürnberg to the Pegnitz River. Leaving Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze with a division to pursue Bernadotte, the archduke thrust north at Jourdan's right flank. The French general fell back to Amberg as Charles and Wartensleben's forces <b>converged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Army of Sambre and Meuse. On 20 August, Moreau sent Jourdan a message vowing to closely follow Charles, {{which he did}} not do. In the Battle of Amberg on 24 August, Charles defeated the French and destroyed two battalions of their rear guard. The Austrians lost 400 killed and wounded out of 40,000 troops. Of a total of 34,000 soldiers, the French suffered losses of 1,200 killed and wounded plus 800 men and two colors captured. Jourdan retreated first to Sulzbach and then behind the Regnitz river where Bernadotte joined him on 28 August. Meanwhile, Hotze reoccupied Nürnberg. Jourdan, who had expected Moreau to keep Charles occupied in the south, now found himself facing a numerically superior enemy.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 October, a young woman struck a marching drum {{at the edge of}} a group of market-women who were infuriated by the chronic {{shortage}} and high price of bread. From their starting point in the markets of the eastern section of Paris then known as the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, the angry women forced a nearby church to toll its bells. Their numbers continued to grow and with restless energy the group began to march. More women from other nearby marketplaces joined in, many bearing kitchen blades and other makeshift weapons, as the tocsins rang from church towers throughout several districts. Driven by a variety of agitators, the mob <b>converged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Hôtel de Ville where they demanded not only bread, but arms. As more and more women – and men – arrived, the crowd outside the city hall reached between six and seven thousand, and perhaps as many as ten thousand.|$|E
5|$|The ROK 1st Infantry Division, with 7,500 men {{had held}} the line around the Bowling Alley since August 12. The Bowling Alley area was {{selected}} because of its advantageous high ground which provided natural barriers to funnel North Korean troops into smaller fronts where South Korean defenses could attack them from the high ground in concealed positions. In the meantime, the KPA 3rd, 13th, and 15th Divisions were advancing south and preparing to close on Taegu. The KPA 13th Division <b>converged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Tabu-dong corridor and a vicious melee ensued between the North and South Korean troops, with ROK 1st Division's 11th, 12th, and 13th regiments committed against the KPA 13th Division's 19th, 21st and 23rd regiments. The fight became a battle of attrition. As the two sides closed on one another, the battle took a brutal turn by August 15 as supplies ran low and units were locked in close quarters combat with little ammunition for the weapons. Fighting across the entire front became hand-to-hand combat and grenade fights at close range. The two divisions were so evenly matched that neither could make any appreciable gains for days of fighting and huge numbers of casualties.|$|E

5|$|The {{crash was}} only {{accessible}} to vehicles via a single residential street. With {{the surge of}} rescue personnel who <b>converged</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> area, the roads leading to the site soon became choked with traffic. Emergency vehicle drivers abandoned their vehicles counter to established policy {{in the course of}} the rescue efforts. This prevented other vehicles from being able to access the crash area. The road was so impassible, many rescue workers left their vehicles miles away and made it to the scene on foot. Fog also grounded rescue helicopters for two hours. As a result, many critically injured survivors were not evacuated until 23:30. Eventually, four helicopters from the New York City Police Aviation Unit evacuated 21 people from the crash site. There were also major problems with communication by rescuers. Radio frequencies became overloaded and authorities on site were unable to make command decisions in some cases. The head of surgery of the Nassau County Medical Center was present at the scene but unable to direct patients to the best locations because many rescuers were radioing the center itself to get advice on where they should send the survivors. Medical professionals on site reported that some hospitals received the most up-to-date information by watching the news coverage. Despite these problems, however, only three of the passengers found alive died of their injuries.|$|E
