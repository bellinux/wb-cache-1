40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this thesis is to {{investigate}} the small-signal stability of transmission networks with wind generation and high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission integrated in them. The topic reflects a number of concerns of transmission network operators in the U. K. and beyond over how stability is maintained as networks evolve. Damping low frequency power oscillations using wide-area signals are illustrated for both line commutated based current source converter (interchangeably referred as LCC or CSC) and self <b>commutated</b> <b>voltage</b> sourced converter (VSC) based HVDC links integrated within host AC networks. With VSC HVDC offering flexibility greater than LCC HVDC in terms of modulating both active and reactive power, it was shown that optimally allocating/sharing the control duty among the multiple control options that exist within a VSC HVDC link, ensures that the overall control duty is reduced, and hence, the dynamic ratings of the expensive converters is minimised. An important consideration {{in the design of}} power oscillation damping (POD) controllers is to ensure that the controller is robust across a range of practical operating conditions. To achieve this, an analytical control design technique is introduced in which all the control loops for a VSC HVDC link, are designed simultaneously in a multi-variable framework. The method results in a set of decentralized, robust single-input-singleoutput (SISO) controllers at the two ends of a VSC HVDC link, which ensures coordinated control action and an acceptable performance level in the event of loss of a remote feedback signal. Damping contribution from remote offshore wind farms connected via VSC HVDC is an important consideration for systems with high penetration of wind energy. The effectiveness of coordinating the supplementary control of the wind farm and the onshore HVDC converter is shown in terms of dynamic variations in wind farmreal power output, DC link voltage and turbine speed. Having examined the damping contribution, frequency support from offshore wind farms is also explored. A method using appropriate droop control on the offshore and onshore HVDC converters is proposed which enables offshore wind farms connected through VSC HVDC link to contribute to system inertia and primary frequency control without having to rely on remote communications. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is illustrated through detailed frequency domain analysis and extensive time-domain simulation results in DIgSILENT PowerFactory on two test systems.

30|$|As {{analyzed}} in Section  2, {{the onset of}} CF has the characteristics of temporal discreteness, and the most adverse fault time for a valve is at the corresponding firing instant. In this subsection, when calculating the post-fault extinction angle, {{it is assumed that}} the trigger pulse is applied to the valve at the fault time and that the <b>commutating</b> <b>voltage</b> changes instantaneously during the fault, which is the worst case. Therefore, the calculated extinction angle for this criterion is the lower bound of the γ values for different fault times.|$|E
30|$|Due to the {{magnitude}} drop and phase shift {{forward of the}} post-fault <b>commutating</b> <b>voltage,</b> the available commutating voltage-time area will decrease. If the AC system fault occurs before the original firing instant of the valve, the HVDC controller will trigger the valve at the fault instant {{in order to increase}} the commutating voltage-time area Sf. If the AC system fault occurs after the original firing instant, there is no time for HVDC controller to adjust the firing instant, and according to the natural response characteristics of valves, the commutation process will lengthen to attempt to increase the commutating voltage-time area Sf.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} a successful commutation in thyristor valves, a certain minimum commutating voltage-time area is required, and this is provided by a minimum extinction angle γmin. The cause of CFs is that the actual extinction angle is less than γmin [14, 15, 16]. Reference [17] introduced {{an expression of the}} extinction angle, which {{is a function of the}} <b>commutating</b> <b>voltage,</b> the DC current, the ignition advance angle, and the phase shift. However, the influence of the phase shift on the extinction angle was derived from empirical or heuristic reasoning (simply subtracting the phase shift from the extinction angle). Besides, the effects of spatial-temporal discreteness of AC system faults on CF should also be taken into consideration.|$|E

30|$|If {{the fault}} is minor, the <b>commutating</b> <b>voltage</b> {{has a small}} change. In this case, a CF happens when a {{converter}} valve that has turned off conducts again automatically when a forward voltage is applied to it, because the voltage blocking capability is not recovered during the reverse voltage. Thus (14) is still applicable. Because Eac 0 is not much larger than Eac and |Δφ| in (15) is relatively small, M <  1. However, M is reduced by the assumption of {{no change in the}} DC current, Id 0  = Id 1, leading to a small increase in γf compared to γ that considers the change in Id. Under critical CF conditions, {{it is likely that the}} assessment criterion will incorrectly predict a CF when in fact commutation succeeds.|$|E
30|$|This {{research}} aims {{to develop}} an efficient approach for CF assessment based on an accurate CF criterion. The spatial-temporal discreteness of AC system faults causing CF is analyzed using the commutating voltage-time area, through which the impact mechanism of the fault position and the fault time on CF is revealed. Then a novel analytical CF criterion based on the minimum extinction angle is derived directly from the equivalent circuit of the commutation process, considering both the magnitude drop and the phase shift of the post-fault <b>commutating</b> <b>voltage.</b> On this basis, an approach to CF assessment is proposed. Instead of employing electromagnetic transient simulations, the proposed assessment method can be accomplished through a short-circuit computing program, which provides an efficient and practical way to assess CF in large-scale power systems.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the results from}} a {{conventional}} ac-dc load flow program for modelling the steady state behaviour of a unit connect salient-pole generator-converter are compared with those obtained from degree by degree dynamic simulation. The Transient Converter Simulation (TCS) program is used to give benchmark results. The unacceptable level of error from the load flow program indicates that the conventional ac-dc formulation is not directly applicable to the unit connected generator-converter. A salient-pole generator converter model has been developed to reduce the errors, which allows for a voltage behind a varying sub-transient reactance {{to be used as}} the <b>commutating</b> <b>voltage.</b> The characteristics obtained from this model are better than for the conventional model but are still significantly different from the TCS results. A dynamic simulation of the operation of the unit connected generator converter is necessary, before steady state results can be obtained. Unit and Group-Connections are also compared under varying steady state loading conditions and by reducing the number of generators in service in both schemes at nominal frequency. An accurate algorithm of general applicability, called the Equivalent Inverter, is proposed which used unit-connection characteristics derived from a time domain simulation. Finally the steady state model for an alternative unit connected generator converter scheme is presented. This is based on the use of dc ripple re-injection, which permits using a single bridge (instead of two) to obtain a twelve-pulse converter operation. The proposed scheme considerably reduces the number of transformers and converter bridges, without increasing the harmonic levels with respect to the double bridge configuration...|$|E

It {{is based on}} a mutually commutated soft-switching converter system and provides a unique integrated solution for the wind turbine generator drive systems, the wind turbine interconnection, and the power conversion for HVDC transmission. In a wind farm, the mutually commutated converter system is a distributed system. A medium-frequency collection grid connects the converter station, equipped with a single-phase voltage source converter and a medium-frequency transmission transformer, with the wind turbines, each containing a cycloconverter and a medium-frequency distribution transformer. In this thesis, various system aspects regarding the application of a distributed mutually commutated converter system in a wind farm are investigated. Special attention is paid to the design of a medium-frequency collection grid that has an acceptable level of transient overvoltages, the design of medium-frequency transformers with suitable magnetic, electric and thermal properties, {{and the development of a}} strategy to <b>commutate</b> the <b>voltage</b> source converter during low power generation. In order to adapt the mutually commutated converter system for an application in a wind farm, it had to be further developped. Different carrier-based and space-vector oriented modulation methods have been investigated. It turns out that for any load angle there is a quasi-discontinuous pulse width modulation strategy that can produce the same pulse patterns as space vector modulation. In addition, a modulation strategy has been developed that allows to replace the IGBTs in the cycloconverter with cheap, robust, and reliable fast thyristors, despite their absence of turn-off capability. The feasibility of different modulation strategies for mutually commutated converter systems has been verified on a down-scaled prototype converter system with both IGBT- and thyristor-based cycloconverters. Finally, a feasible wind farm layout is proposed, which considerably reduces the energy generation costs for large winds farms distant to a strong grid connection point. As a consequence, the proposed solution may facilitate the establishment of remotely located wind farms.  QC 2010080...|$|R

40|$|A new concept, the multi level voltage/current {{reinjection}} ac/dc conversion, {{is described}} in this thesis. Novel voltage and current source converter configurations, based on voltage and current reinjection concepts are proposed. These converter configurations are thoroughly analyzed in their ac and dc system sides. The fundamentals of the reinjection concept is discussed briefly, which lead to the derivation of the ideal reinjection waveform for complete harmonic cancellation and approximations for practical implementation. The concept of multi level voltage reinjection VSC is demonstrated through two types of configurations, based on standard 12 -pulse parallel and series connected VSC modified with reinjection bridges and transformers.

As cable systems were used very early in largecities, {{one of the first}} applications considered for HVDC wasto use it for city infeed and some schemes were also built. However, {{it turned out that the}} cost for the stations was toohigh and that the savings on the cable part were not highenough to justify the high costs of the converter stations,even considering other possible benefits of the HVDC techniquessuch as fast control of active power and almost no contributionto fault currents. During the 1990 s new HVDC Voltage Source Converters, VSC,and new HVDC cables with solid insulation have been developedand the relative cost for the converters has been steadilydecreasing. It was, therefore, found justifiable to reexaminethe feasibility of using HVDC, especially based on the new VSCtechnique, for feeding electrical power to large cities. It wasalso decided, that the study should clarify the specialrequirements that had to be considered in the planning of cityinfeed systems as no good survey could be found. Because ofthis the study has been performed in close co-operation with anumber of utilities responsible for the power supply of somemedium sized and large cities. One such requirement, that alsojustified the study, was that it is expected that in the futuremore overhead lines in the cities or close to the cities haveto be replaced by cables. Although the transmission and distribution of electricalpower will be preferably made with conventional AC technique,but HVDC transmission would offer special advantages for longtransmission cable, systems with especial requirements withregard to power flow control, systems with restrictions toshort circuit currents, and other relevant issues related tocity center infeed. The use of HVDC transmission to feed powerinto city centers will also be preferable when severerestrictions exist in the system that would require significantadditional measures to mitigate using conventional ACtechnique. In those cases, the cost of these additionalmeasures can be significant enough to justify the use of analternative technique. Or, the implementation of those measureswill make the system too complex to operate. In these cases,HVDC transmission would have advantages over the conventionalAC solution, simplifying the operation of the system orresulting in a more economical solution.

Both Line Commutated Converter (LCC) and Voltage Sourced Converter (VSC) based HVDC systems are discussed. First, a LCC HVDC transmission system scheme for grid integration of an offshore wind farm and an oil & gas installation was studied. After the derivation of system mathematical model, the operation principle and control strategies of proposed system are described and validated by a PSCAD/EMTDC based model. Additionally, a STATCOM was proposed to provide commutation voltage and reactive power to the system. Furthermore, an effective fault ride through method is give and demonstrated during the on shore grid fault. The reactive power support by wind farm during fault condition can not only reduce the STATCOM size but also improve the system stability. The simulation results demonstrated the robust system performance during both the normal operation and the various grid fault conditions. Second, a VSC HVDC transmission system is further investigated {{for its ability to}} integrate the offshore wind farm and oil & gas installations to shore. An analysis and new fault mitigation methods of the VSC HVDC transmission system are presented. A fixed frequency controller is described for the voltage and power regulation. On the fault occurrence in the onshore AC grid, the proposed DC link voltage controller initiates fast output power drop of the wind farm, {{in order to avoid the}} overvoltage in the DC transmission link. On the faults occurrence at the oil & gas installation, the proposed control employs a voltage-dependent limiter, to limit the maximum amount of active power through the offshore VSC.
