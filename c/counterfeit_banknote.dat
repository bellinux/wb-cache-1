50|$|First {{introduced}} on July 1, 2002, {{de facto}} this banknote {{does not appear}} common to the public possibly due to its new denomination and fears of losses through receiving a large-value <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknote.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Counterfeit</b> <b>banknote</b> {{detection}} pens {{are used}} to detect counterfeit Swiss franc, euro and United States banknotes, amongst others. Typically, genuine banknotes are printed on paper based on cotton fibers and do not contain the starches that are reactive with iodine. When the pen is used to mark genuine bills, the mark is yellowish or colourless.|$|E
50|$|By 2013, {{counterfeit}} {{versions of}} the banknote represented half of all <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknotes</b> in circulation in Quebec, and 80% of all <b>counterfeit</b> $100 <b>banknotes</b> in the province.|$|R
50|$|The {{general public}} {{correctly}} identified 72% of <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknotes,</b> 80% of genuine $10 banknotes and 89% of genuine $20 banknotes. Commercial cash handlers, such as retail cashiers, correctly identified 86% of <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknotes,</b> 89% of genuine $10 banknotes and 94% of genuine $20 banknotes. Bank tellers correctly identified 89% of <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknotes,</b> 91% of genuine $10 banknotes and 95% of genuine $20 banknotes. All groups performed better with high-quality notes (that is, {{those that were}} clean and undamaged) with the exception that the general public misidentified many high-quality genuine $10 <b>banknotes</b> as <b>counterfeit,</b> which was attributed to the public's suspicion of new banknotes.|$|R

50|$|Most of the Bill Counters (Also Known as Money Counters) having {{counterfeit}} detection measures built in. The {{most common}} are ultraviolet (UV) and magnetic (MG) detection. This means the counter will scan the ultraviolet {{properties of the}} Bill(Money/ Currency of a particular country) and the magnetic ink {{at the same time}} it is counting the currency. Most Money counters will stop and alert the user when a <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknote</b> is detected.|$|E
50|$|In pursuance {{to section}} 103 of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200 of Laws of Hong Kong), {{anyone who wants}} to {{reproduce}} the whole or any part of any Hong Kong currency note for any purpose in any form must apply in writing to the Monetary Authority for approval. No reproduced images should be submitted with the application because such an action would already amount to a breach of section 103 of the Crimes Ordinance. It is a criminal offence under the Crimes Ordinance to manufacture or knowingly pass, tender or possess a <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknote.</b> The offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.|$|E
40|$|Despite a {{decrease}} in the use of currency due to the recent growth in the use of electronic financial transactions, real money transactions remain very important in the global market. While performing transactions with real money, touching and counting notes by hand, is still a common practice in daily life, various types of automated machines, such as ATMs and banknote counters, are essential for large-scale and safe transactions. This paper presents studies that have been conducted in four major areas of research (banknote recognition, <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknote</b> detection, serial number recognition, and fitness classification) in the accurate banknote recognition field by various sensors in such automated machines, and describes the advantages and drawbacks of the methods presented in those studies. While to a limited extent some surveys have been presented in previous studies in the areas of banknote recognition or <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknote</b> recognition, this paper is {{the first of its kind}} to review all four areas. Techniques used in each of the four areas recognize banknote information (denomination, serial number, authenticity, and physical condition) based on image or sensor data, and are actually applied to banknote processing machines across the world. This study also describes the technological challenges faced by such banknote recognition techniques and presents future directions of research to overcome them...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Banknote {{validation}} {{systems are}} used to discriminate between genuine and <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknotes.</b> The paper propose a one-class classifier for genuine class using a new similarity measure, Fuzzy Hamming Distance. For each banknote several regions are considered (corresponding to security features) and each region is split inÑ¢Òpartitions, to include position information. The feature space used by the classifier consists from color histograms of each partition. The Fuzzy Hamming Distance proves {{to have a good}} discrimination power being able to completely discriminate between the genuine and <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknotes.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|The <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknote</b> is {{a growing}} threat to the society since the advancements {{in the field of}} computers, {{scanners}} and photocopiers, as they have made the duplication process for banknote much simpler. The fake note detection systems developed so far have many drawbacks such as high cost, poor accuracy, unavailability, lack of user-friendliness and lower effectiveness. One possible solution to this problem could be the use of a system uniquely linked to the banknote itself. In this paper, we present a unique identification and authentication process for the banknote using chaotic elements embedded in it. A chaotic element means that the physical elements are formed from a random process independent from human intervention. The chaotic elements used in this paper are the random distribution patterns of such security fibres set into the paper pulp. A unique ID is generated from the fibre pattern obtained from UV image of the note, which can be verified by any person who receives the banknote to decide whether the banknote is authentic or not. Performance analysis of the system is also studied in this paper...|$|E
40|$|With the {{advancement}} in imaging technologies for scanning and printing, production of counterfeit banknotes has become cheaper, easier, and more common. The proliferation of counterfeit banknotes causes loss to banks, traders, and individuals involved in financial transactions. Hence, it is inevitably needed that efficient and reliable techniques for detection of counterfeit banknotes should be developed. With {{the availability of}} powerful smartphones, it has become possible to perform complex computations and image processing related tasks on these phones. In addition to this, smartphone users have increased greatly and numbers continue to increase. This is a great motivating factor for researchers and developers to propose innovative mobile-based solutions. In this study, a novel technique for verification of Pakistani banknotes is developed, targeting smartphones with android platform. The proposed technique is based on statistical features, and surface roughness of a banknote, representing different properties of the banknote, such as paper material, printing ink, paper quality, and surface roughness. The selection of these features is motivated by the X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis of genuine and counterfeit banknotes. In this regard, two important areas of the banknote, i. e., serial number and flag portions were considered since these portions showed the maximum difference between genuine and <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknote.</b> The analysis confirmed that genuine and counterfeit banknotes are very different {{in terms of the}} printing process, the ingredients used in preparation of banknotes, {{and the quality of the}} paper. After extracting the discriminative set of features, support vector machine is used for classification. The experimental results confirm the high accuracy of the proposed technique...|$|E
50|$|The Bank of Canada {{commissioned}} a research survey of cash handlers {{and the general}} public to determine the effectiveness of the security features on the Birds of Canada and Canadian Journey series banknotes. The research found that participants correctly identified 84% of <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknotes</b> based only on fluorescence features, 83% based only on microprinting and fine line features, and 80% based only on portrait features. Genuine banknotes were correctly identified 88%, 97%, and 89% of the time, respectively. The optical security device was the most effective security feature, used to correctly identify 98% of <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknotes</b> and 95% of genuine banknotes.|$|R

40|$|Counterfeit goods {{continue}} {{to undermine the}} value of genuine artifacts. This also applies to <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknotes,</b> a significant <b>counterfeit</b> problem in today’s rapidly growing world of technology. The following research explores anti-counterfeit printing methods for banknotes from various countries and evaluates which are the most effective for eliminating counterfeit. The research methods {{used in this study}} consists primarily of elite and specialized interviewing accompanied with content analysis. Three professionals currently involved in the security-printing industry were interviewed and provided the most current information about banknote security printing. Conclusions were reached that the most effective security printing methods for banknotes rest upon the use of layering features, specifically both overt and covert features. This also includes the use of a watermark, optical variable inks, and the intaglio printing process. It was also found that despite the plethora of anti-counterfeit methods, the reality is that counterfeit will never be eliminated. Unfortunately, <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknotes</b> will remain a part of our world. The battle against <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknotes</b> will have to incorporate new tactics, such as improving public education, creating effective law enforcement, and relieving extreme poverty so that counterfeit does not have to take place...|$|R
