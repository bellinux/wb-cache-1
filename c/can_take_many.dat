5|$|In {{developed}} counties, {{training programs}} specifically {{relating to the}} international practice of emergency medicine are now available within many emergency medicine residencies. The curriculum that should be covered by such programs {{has been the subject}} of much discussion. Patient care, medical knowledge, practice-based learning, communication skills, professionalism, and system-based practice are the basic six competencies required of programs approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, but the application of these goals <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>many</b> forms.|$|E
5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} somatic cells, the poly(A) tail of most mRNAs in the cytoplasm gradually get shorter, and mRNAs with shorter poly(A) tail are translated {{less and}} degraded sooner. However, it <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>many</b> hours before an mRNA is degraded. This deadenylation and degradation {{process can be}} accelerated by microRNAs complementary to the 3' untranslated region of an mRNA. In immature egg cells, mRNAs with shortened poly(A) tails are not degraded, but are instead stored without being translated. They are then activated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation after fertilisation, during egg activation.|$|E
5|$|Moving towards {{sustainability}} is also {{a social}} challenge that entails international and national law, urban planning and transport, local and individual lifestyles and ethical consumerism. Ways of living more sustainably <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>many</b> forms from reorganizing living conditions (e.g., ecovillages, eco-municipalities and sustainable cities), reappraising economic sectors (permaculture, green building, sustainable agriculture), or work practices (sustainable architecture), using science to develop new technologies (green technologies, renewable energy and sustainable fission and fusion power), or designing systems in a flexible and reversible manner, and adjusting individual lifestyles that conserve natural resources.|$|E

5|$|The {{components}} in an electric circuit <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>many</b> forms, which can include {{elements such as}} resistors, capacitors, switches, transformers and electronics. Electronic circuits contain active components, usually semiconductors, and typically exhibit non-linear behaviour, requiring complex analysis. The simplest electric components {{are those that are}} termed passive and linear: while they may temporarily store energy, they contain no sources of it, and exhibit linear responses to stimuli.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} forms of sailing ships, but they all have certain basic things in common. Except for rotor ships using the Magnus effect, every sailing ship has a hull, rigging {{and at least one}} mast to hold up the sails that use the wind to power the ship. Ocean journeys by sailing ship <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>many</b> months, and a common hazard is becoming becalmed because of lack of wind, or being blown off course by severe storms or winds that do not allow progress in the desired direction. A severe storm could lead to shipwreck, and the loss of all hands. Sailing ships can only carry a certain quantity of supplies in their hold, so they have to plan long voyages carefully to include appropriate provisions, including fresh water.|$|E

25|$|Response to stimuli: a {{response}} <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>many</b> forms, from the contraction of a unicellular organism to external chemicals, to complex reactions involving all the senses of multicellular organisms. A response is often expressed by motion; for example, {{the leaves of}} a plant turning toward the sun (phototropism), and chemotaxis.|$|E
25|$|As a {{scientific}} discipline, computer vision {{is concerned with}} the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>many</b> forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multi-dimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.|$|E
25|$|Trafficking of {{children}} involves the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt {{of children}} {{for the purpose of}} exploita commercial sexual exploitation of children <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>many</b> forms, including forcing a child into prostitution or other forms of sexual activity or child pornography. Child exploitation may also involve forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude, the removal of organs, illicit international adoption, trafficking for early marriage, recruitment as child soldiers, for use in begging or as athletes (such as child camel jockeys or football players).|$|E

25|$|Steam locomotives, by comparison, require {{intensive}} maintenance, lubrication, {{and cleaning}} before, during, and after use. Preparing and firing a steam locomotive for use from cold <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>many</b> hours, {{although it may}} be kept in readiness between uses with a small fire to maintain a slight heat in the boiler, but this requires regular stoking and frequent attention to maintain the level of water in the boiler. This may be necessary to prevent the water in the boiler freezing in cold climates, so long as the water supply itself is not frozen.|$|E
25|$|The {{collector}} of a centrifugal compressor <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>many</b> shapes and forms. When the diffuser discharges {{into a large}} empty chamber, the collector may be termed a Plenum. When the diffuser discharges into a device that looks somewhat like a snail shell, bull's horn or a French horn, the collector {{is likely to be}} termed a volute or scroll. As the name implies, a collector’s purpose is to gather the flow from the diffuser discharge annulus and deliver this flow to a downstream pipe. Either the collector or the pipe may also contain valves and instrumentation to control the compressor.|$|E
25|$|Splitter: A {{splitter}} or {{riving knife}} is a vertical projection located behind the saw blade. This {{can be a}} pin or a fin. It is slightly narrower in width than the blade and located directly {{in line with the}} blade. The splitter prevents the material being cut from being rotated thereby helping to prevent kickback. Splitters may incorporate pawls, a mechanism with teeth designed to bite into wood and preventing kickback. Splitters <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>many</b> forms, including being part of the blade guard that comes standard with the saw. Another type of splitter is simply a vertical pin or fin attached to an insert. Splitters are available commercially or can be made from wood, metal or plastic.|$|E

50|$|Second warrant {{officers}} <b>can</b> <b>take</b> up <b>many</b> billets in command, staff, {{and instructional}} settings. They may be appointed regimental sergeant major or regimental quartermaster sergeant of a battalion-sized unit. They may also work in staff positions at brigade-sized units.|$|R
25|$|Mud flows (lahars) are remobilized {{hydrated}} ash deposits from pyroclastic {{flows and}} ash fall deposits, moving downslope even at very shallow angles at high speed. Because {{of their high}} density {{they are capable of}} moving large objects such as loaded logging trucks, houses, bridges, and boulders. Their deposits usually form a second ring of debris fans around volcanic edifices, the inner fan being primary ash deposits. Downstream of the deposition of their finest load, lahars can still pose a sheet flood hazard from the residual water. Lahar deposits <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>many</b> months to dry out, until they can be walked on. The hazards derived from lahar activity can exist several years after a large explosive eruption.|$|E
25|$|All of the {{atypical}} antipsychotics warn {{about the}} possibility of tardive dyskinesia in their package inserts and in the PDR. It is not possible to truly know the risks of tardive dyskinesia when taking atypicals, because tardive dyskinesia <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>many</b> decades to develop and the atypical antipsychotics are not old enough to have been tested over a long enough period of time to determine all of the long-term risks. One hypothesis as to why atypicals have a lower risk of tardive dyskinesia is because they are much less fat-soluble than the typical antipsychotics and because they are readily released from D2 receptor and brain tissue. The typical antipsychotics remain attached to the D2 receptors and accumulate in the brain tissue which may lead to TD.|$|E
25|$|The classic {{presentation}} (in 40–50% of the cases) is episodic hematuria, {{which usually}} starts {{within a day}} or two of a non-specific upper respiratory tract infection (hence synpharyngitic), as opposed to post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which occurs some time (weeks) after initial infection. Less commonly gastrointestinal or urinary infection can be the inciting agent. All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence IgA antibody production. Groin pain can also occur. The gross hematuria resolves after a few days, though microscopic hematuria may persist. These episodes occur on an irregular basis every few months and in most patients eventually subsides, although it <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>many</b> years. Renal function usually remains normal, though rarely, acute kidney failure may occur (see below). This presentation is more common in younger adults.|$|E
