Plotz and Oldstone presented evidence that autoimmunity can arise {{as a result of}} a <b>cross-reaction</b> between the idiotype on an antiviral antibody and a host cell receptor for the virus in question. In this case, the host-cell receptor is envisioned as an internal image of the virus, and the anti-idiotype antibodies can react with the host cells.|$|E

40|$|This review {{summarizes}} {{data on the}} <b>cross-reactions</b> observed {{among the}} subtypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Types 6 A and 6 B; 19 F, 19 A, 19 B, and 19 C; 18 F, 18 A, 18 B, and 18 C; and 23 F, 23 A, and 23 B were examined with use of radioimmunoassay for measurement of inhibition of binding; the <b>cross-reactions</b> are {{discussed in terms of}} the known chemical structures of the antigens involved. <b>Cross-reactions</b> observed with use of rabbit antisera proved to be an unreliable guide to the responses observed thus far in humans. <b>Cross-reactions</b> of pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide antigens with other bacterial antigens are mentioned. These <b>cross-reactions</b> are analyzed with the idea of maximizing the effectiveness of the pneumococcal vaccine. Immunologic factors that may determine the quality and/or quantity of the immune response to immunization are discussed. These factors include antigenic competition and influence of preimmuniza-tion levels of antibody. Antigenic competition, although not a major concern with the present vaccine, may determine the upper limit of the number of capsular types that can be present in a single vaccine. The preimmunization level of antibody may determine the specificity of the antibody produced after vaccination...|$|R

25|$|Dermal {{exposure}} has {{not been}} associated with systemic toxicity but anecdotal reports of allergic responses may be a sensitization to nickel and <b>cross-reaction</b> with copper or a skin irritation from copper. Workers exposed to high air levels of copper (resulting in an estimated intake of 200mg Cu/d) developed signs suggesting copper toxicity (e.g., elevated serum copper levels, hepatomegaly). However, other co-occurring exposures to pesticidal agents or in mining and smelting may contribute to these effects.

25|$|It is {{possible}} that food and environmental antigens (bacterial, viral, or plant antigens) have epitopes similar enough to A and B glycoprotein antigens. The antibodies created against these environmental antigens {{in the first years}} of life can cross-react with ABO-incompatible red blood cells that it comes in contact with during blood transfusion later in life. Anti-A antibodies are hypothesized to originate from immune response towards influenza virus, whose epitopes are similar enough to the α-D-N-galactosamine on the A glycoprotein to be able to elicit a <b>cross-reaction.</b> Anti-B antibodies are hypothesized to originate from antibodies produced against Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, cross-reacting with the α-D-galactose on the B glycoprotein.|$|E
25|$|In {{synthetic}} {{organic chemistry}} orthogonal protection {{is a strategy}} allowing the deprotection of functional groups independently of each other. In chemistry and biochemistry, an orthogonal interaction occurs when there are two pairs of substances and each substance can interact with their respective partner, but does not interact with either substance of the other pair. For example, DNA has two orthogonal pairs: cytosine and guanine form a base-pair, and adenine and thymine form another base-pair, but other base-pair combinations are strongly disfavored. As a chemical example, tetrazine reacts with transcyclooctene and azide reacts with cyclooctyne without any <b>cross-reaction,</b> so these are mutually orthogonal reactions, and so, can be performed simultaneously and selectively. Bioorthogonal chemistry refers to chemical reactions occurring inside living systems without reacting with naturally present cellular components. In supramolecular chemistry the notion of orthogonality refers {{to the possibility of}} two or more supramolecular, often non-covalent, interactions being compatible; reversibly forming without interference from the other.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Cross-reactivity in {{the delayed}} {{hypersensitivity}} response to mycobacteria of different Runyon groups was tested in Swiss white mice immunised with live mycobacteria. All the strains tested gave <b>cross-reactions</b> and, generally, slow growers gave stronger <b>cross-reactions</b> with other slow growers than with rapid growers and vice versa. Sonicates of cross-reacting mycobacteria were also tested {{for their ability}} to generate activated macrophages in mice immunised with Mycobacterium avium. All the mycobacterial sonicates generated activated macrophages but a sonicate of Salmonella typhi did not.

40|$|Five arginine-utilizing, nonglycolytic Mycoplasma {{species were}} {{compared}} serologically by two dimensional immunoelectrophoresis. The survey included: Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma arthritidis, Mycoplasma gateae, Mycoplasma gallinarum, and three strains of Mycoplasma arginini. Although the M. arginini strains showed strong <b>cross-reactions,</b> each strain produced a different antigenic profile which was distinct and which indicated significant antigenic differences between strains. The M. arginini strains showed strong relationships with M. gateae; lesser <b>cross-reactions</b> were observed with other strains. Common antigens were demonstrable {{in the entire}} group. When all these species were compared with a glycolytic species, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, no <b>cross-reactions</b> were observed.

Bacteriol. 92 : 1590 – 1596. 1966. —Eight {{strains of}} streptococci were isolated from human carious lesions by the fluorescent-antibody (FA) technique. Seven of these strains produced experimental caries in hamsters or rats maintained {{on a high}} sucrose diet. The eighth strain was noncariogenic in animals but possessed some antigenic components {{in common with the}} cariogenic strains. On the basis of antigen-antibody reactions by microprecipitin and agar-gel diffusion patterns, the strains were divided into four groups; these groups differed with regard to their cariogenic activity in hamsters. Fluorescein-conjugated antisera, prepared against the human strains, showed some <b>cross-reactions</b> which interfered with the efficacy of the FA technique in differentiating between the related streptococcal groups. To eliminate these <b>cross-reactions,</b> a small amount of related-strain antisera was added to the fluorescein-conjugated antisera to the cariogenic strains.
