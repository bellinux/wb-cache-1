50|$|The {{funds that}} the IDB lends are raised by selling bonds to {{institutional}} investors at standard commercial rates of interest. The bonds are backed by (a) {{the sum of}} the capital subscriptions actually paid in by the Bank's 47 member countries, plus (b) {{the sum of the}} <b>callable</b> <b>capital</b> subscriptions pledged by the Bank's 22 non-borrowing member countries. Together these constitute the Bank's ordinary capital, some US$101 billion. Of this amount, 4.3 percent is paid in, while the remaining 95.7 percent is callable.|$|E
50|$|The <b>callable</b> <b>capital</b> pledged by the 22 non-borrowing members, {{which include}} the world's wealthiest {{developed}} countries, therefore functions as a guarantee for the bonds that the IDB sells. This arrangement ensures that the IDB maintains a triple-A credit rating, {{and as a result}} can make loans to its borrowing member countries at rates of interest similar to those that commercial banks charge their largest corporate borrowers. At the same time, the 22 non-borrowing countries are only putting up guarantees - not actual funds - so their support of the IDB's lending operations has a minimal impact on their national budgets.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{sets forth}} some basic {{principles}} {{that could help}} debt managers in emerging market and other countries to plan and implement sovereign debt buyback and swap operations. It discusses the macroeconomic context in which buybacks and swaps are undertaken, the objectives of buybacks and swaps, the analytical framework for deciding whether to undertake a particular buyback or swap operation and for selecting among alternative operations, and some key issues in {{the determination of the}} strategy for executing buybacks and swaps. The focus is on developing the analytical framework for evaluating sovereign debt buyback and swap operations, since very little work has been done in this area. In this regard, the paper presents a step-wise decision-making procedure, in which discounted cash flow analysis and the use of strategic benchmarks for the debt play central roles.

50|$|According to Articles of Agreement of the New Development Bank, {{the initial}} {{authorized}} {{capital of the}} bank is divided into 1 mln shares, having a par value of $100,000. The value of one share is also the minimum amount to be subscribed for participation by a single country. Attachment 1 to this document states that each {{founding member of the}} bank will initially subscribe 100,000 shares, in a total of $10 bln, of which 20,000 shares correspond to paid-in capital, in a total of $2 bln and 80,000 shares correspond to <b>callable</b> <b>capital,</b> in a total of $8 bln.The current distribution of shares between NDB member countries is presented in the following table.|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This report discusses Multilateral Development Banks (MDB), which provide financial support for projects and programs that promote social and economic progress in developing countries. GAO provides (1) summaries of each bank's mission, function, and operations; (2) key bank financial data covering the last three fiscal years; and (3) information on the U. S. investment in capital and voting percentages in each MDB. GAO found that MDBs are autonomous international financial entities that finance {{economic and social development}} projects and programs in developing countries. The MDBs primarily fund these projects and programs using money borrowed from world capital markets or money provided by the governments of member countries. MDBs enable developing countries to access foreign currency resources on more advantageous terms than would be available to them {{on the basis of their}} own international credit standing. The MDBs provide assistance in the form of loans, equity investments, loan and equity guarantees, and technical assistance. Direct lending is the primary vehicle of development assistance. The United States is the largest member in most of the MDBs discussed in this report, contributing significant amounts to support the missions of the MDBs and subscribing a significant amount to MDBs' <b>callable</b> <b>capital.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has {{recently}} tested credit risk measurement models used by large international banks {{to measure the}} risk of their credit portfolios {{in order to measure}} the risk of default of its portfolio of insured banks. Using both balance sheet and equity market data for a sample of 15 large Italian banks, this study applies a credit value at risk model to estimate both individual and portfolio default risks for the Fondo Interbancario di Tutela dei Depositi (FITD), the Italian deposit insurance fund. The empirical analysis allows us to estimate the loss probability distribution of the FITD exposures which in turn can be used to: (i) evaluate the FITD fund adequacy; (ii) estimate the marginal contribution to the whole portfolio risk of an individual insured bank; (iii) test an alternative risk-. adjusted deposit insurance pricing scheme to the more traditional one based on option pricing models. Two main results emerge from the empirical analysis. First, the estimated total risk-based premium for the sample banks is in line with the current practice of the FITD and with its available <b>callable</b> <b>capital.</b> Second, significant differences appear to exist in the pricing of the deposit insurance service for the different sample banks. Such differences reflect both differences in the banks ’ individual risk profiles and the higher impact that the exposures to larger banks present on the risk profile of the FITD portfolio...|$|E
