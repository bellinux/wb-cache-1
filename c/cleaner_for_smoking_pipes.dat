50|$|Meerschaum has {{occasionally}} {{been used}} as a substitute for soapstone, fuller's earth, and as a building material; but its chief use is <b>for</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>pipes</b> and cigarette holders. The first recorded use of meerschaum for making pipes was around 1723 and quickly became prized as the perfect material for providing a cool, dry, flavorful smoke. The porous nature of meerschaum draws moisture and tobacco tar into the stone. Meerschaum became a premium substitute for the clay pipes of the day and remains prized to this day, though since the mid-1800s briar pipes have become the most common <b>pipes</b> <b>for</b> <b>smoking.</b>|$|R

40|$|The tree heath (Erica arborea L.), a small {{evergreen}} tree {{found in}} the Mediterranean region and parts of Eastern and Central Africa, produces lignotubers that are highly valued <b>for</b> making <b>smoking</b> <b>pipes.</b> The Peloritani Mountains of northeastern Sicily are historically {{one of the most}} important areas in Italy for the production of these high quality lignotubers, known as briar root wood. In the past, tree heath shrublands were also an important source of charcoal. Erica arborea utilisation has declined dramatically during the past century, mostly due to the decreasing demand <b>for</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>pipes,</b> as well as the increasing frequency of wildfires and large-scale afforestation activities in this region. Until recent decades, Erica arborea management (grub felling), which represented an important economic activity for some local communities, also contributed to wildfire prevention by maintaining low heath tree cover which helped to inhibit fire spread. The majority of Erica arborea maquis is currently found on State-owned lands where traditional harvesting practices (i. e., uprooting trees) is discouraged, leading to higher density stands more susceptible to fire. At present, the tree heath industry is in sharp decline, with irregular management of the resource and poor commercial value of heath root wood due in part to frequent fires. Recently social trends and the establishment of new protected areas in tree heath shrublands discourage the utilization of Erica arborea and the conservation of the material culture and landscape associated with its management. It is proposed that tree heath cultivation be continued only in those areas best suited in order to preserve its cultural and environmental roles, and that forest management practices be improved to increase the economic viability of tree heath grub felling activities...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Located on {{the central}} Oregon coast, the Umpqua Eden site (35 D 083) yielded an {{artifact}} assemblage {{which is one of}} the five largest assemblages from the Oregon coast. The first aspect of the site that I looked at is the people who lived at the site, the ancestors of the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw. In turn, I consulted with Patty Whereat, the Cultural Resources Director for the tribes, which resulted in a more holistic view of the site. Additionally, I attempted to uncover possible women's and men's activity areas of the Umpqua Eden site. A wealth of information on the native peoples of the Oregon coast was discovered, revealing that the sexual division of labor was not extremely rigid before Euro-American contact and the social category of "female" was expanded to more than two genders with consideration given to the two-spirited individual. I also attempted to engender the archaeological record by looking at the processes involved in the manufacture of <b>smoking</b> <b>pipes</b> and the cultivation of tobacco. During the ethnographic period, women were not smoking pipes; however, they were probably cultivating the tobacco and possibly gathering the clay <b>for</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>pipes.</b> I suggest that there was an agricultural element to the hunter-gatherer native populations of the central Oregon coast and challenge Western assumptions of individualism in precontact groups of the Oregon coast. I also provide a comparative analysis of clay, schist and steatite pipes of the Oregon coast. The <b>smoking</b> <b>pipes</b> are all straight and tubular (9...|$|R

50|$|Tobacco, one of {{the most}} widely used {{addictive}} substances in the world, is a plant native to the Americas and historically {{one of the}} half-dozen most important crops grown by American farmers. More specifically, tobacco refers to any of various plants of the genus Nicotiana (especially N. tabacum) native to tropical America and widely cultivated for their leaves, which are dried and processed chiefly <b>for</b> <b>smoking</b> in <b>pipes,</b> cigarettes, and cigars; it is also cut to form chewing tobacco or ground to make snuff or dipping tobacco, as well as other less common preparations.
