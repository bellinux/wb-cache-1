40|$|AbstractHigh-efficiency {{separation}} of hard-to-float high-ash fine coals {{has been a}} research hotspot in some countries, especially in China. Separation of hard-to-float high-ash fine coals by froth flotation, although {{considered to be the}} most effective, remains some challenges to be overcome. In this paper, the mineralogical/petrologic, physical and chemical characteristics of the of a hard-to-float high-ash fine coal collected in Kailuan mining area were studied. The floatability and liberation characteristics of this coal sample and potential separation processes were investigated experimentally. According to the coal characteristics, four separation processes were put forward and evaluated. Experimental results indicated that classified floatation couldn’t effectively improve the fine coal quality, while the processes of fine grinding-recleaning to roughing <b>cleaning</b> <b>coal</b> and selective agglomeration-floatation were suitable for the Kailuan coal. Compared with the original coal flotation process, the processes of fine grinding-recleaning to roughing <b>cleaning</b> <b>coal</b> increased the cumulative yield from 50. 87 % up to 55. 53 % while reduced the product ash content from 11. 76 % down to 10. 74 %. In the processes of selective agglomeration-floatation, the lowest ash of clean coal is 10. 69 %, with 58. 72 % yield, 7. 85 % higher in yield and 1. 07 % lower in ash content.

40|$|ABSTRACT) The {{costs of}} <b>cleaning</b> fine <b>coal</b> are {{substantially}} {{higher than those}} of <b>cleaning</b> coarse <b>coal.</b> Therefore, many many coal companies in the U. S. choose to discard fine coal (150 micron x 0) by means of 6 -inch diameter hydrocyclones. The cyclone overflows are stored in fine coal impoundments, which create environmental concerns and represent loss of valuable national resources. The major component of the high costs of <b>cleaning</b> fine <b>coal</b> is associated with the difficulty in fine coal dewatering. Therefore, the availability of efficient of fine coal dewatering methods will greatly benefit companies In the present study, three different novel dewatering aids have been tested. These include Reagents W (RW), Reagent U (RU), and Reagent V (RV). These reagents are designed to increase the contact angles of the coal samples to be dewatered, which should help decrease the Laplace pressure of the water trapped in filter cake and, hence, increase dewatering rate.

The characteristics of magnetic material in CFA vary depending on the coal source and operating conditions of the coal boiler (Zyryanov et al. 2011). The basic principle behind magnetic separation deals with the fact that materials having different magnetic moments experience varying forces {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field gradient.

An investigation of the phenomena which occur during the oil agglomeration of coal particle suspensions showed that the process of agglomeration involves several step which can be identified by changes in agitator torque and by application of optical microscopy. During one of these steps, aggregation of hydrophobic particles and microflocs takes place on the surface of gas bubbles dispersed in the suspension with the result that large flocs or flakes are produced which subsequently evolve into agglomerates.

40|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> is a {{technology}} that can solve {{a broad array of}} environmental problems associated with older, state-of-the-art, and future electric generating stations. <b>Coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> provides many environmental benefits. It reduces the concentration of inorganic minerals and elements found in association with coal, some of which are potentially toxic even though they are found in coal in only trace amounts. Currently, more sulfur and related S 0 {sub 2 }, is removed by <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> than by all post-combustion technologies combined. By increasing thermal efficiency and reducing parasitic power requirements, <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> reduces all power plant emissions per unit of electricity produced, including S 0 {sub 2 }, NO{sub x} C 0 {sub 2 }, and hazardous air pollutant precursors (HAPs). While <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> is a mature technology, in the past <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> has only been used for the comparatively simple purposes of removing ash-forming and sulfur-bearing minerals. The application of this technology to H APs control will require a more sophisticated approach, based on a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of trace element removal. The trace elements named as HAPs in the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act can occur in coal in numerous forms. For example, antimony is believed to be present in pyrite, accessory sulfides such as stibnite, and organically-bound; arsenic may be primarily associated with late-stage (epigenetic) pyrite; cadmium is found with sphalerite and other sulfides; chromium may be associated with clays; mercury may occur predominately in epigenetic pyrite; and selenium may be organically-bound or associated with pyrite or accessory minerals such as clausthalite. In addition to a range of modes of occurrence, the range of concentration of trace elements in coals varies remarkably. For example, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) has reported the following range of concentrations for these elements: antimony - ND (not detected) to 35 ppm, arsenic - ND to 2, 200 ppm, cadmium - ND to 170 ppm, chromium - ND to 250 ppm, mercury - ND to 5 ppm, and selenium - ND to 150 ppm...|$|R

40|$|Ever-stringent {{environmental}} constraints dictate that future <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> technologies {{be compatible with}} micron-size particles.

This research program seeks to develop an advanced <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> technology uniquely suited to micron-size particles, i. e., aqueous biphase extraction. This technique relies {{on the ability of}} an aqueous system consisting of a water-soluble organic polymer and an inorganic metal salt to separate into two immiscible aqueous phases.

40|$|The {{technical}} feasibility {{of a gas}} agglomeration method for <b>cleaning</b> <b>coal</b> was demonstrated by means of bench-scale tests conducted with a mixing system which enabled the treatment of ultra-fine coal particles with a colloidal suspension of microscopic gas bubbles in water. A suitable suspension of microbubbles was prepared by first saturating water with air or carbon dioxide under pressure then reducing the pressure to release the dissolved gas. The formation of microbubbles was facilitated by agitation and {{a small amount of}} i-octane. When the suspension of microbubbles and coal particles was mixed, agglomeration was rapid and small spherical agglomerates were produced. Since the agglomerates floated, they were separated from the nonfloating tailings in a settling chamber. By employing this process in numerous agglomeration tests of moderately hydrophobic coals with 26 wt. % ash, it was shown that the ash content would be reduced to 6 [...] 7 wt. % while achieving a coal recovery of 75 to 85 % on a dry, ash-free basis. This was accomplished by employing a solids concentration of 3 to 5 w/w%, an air saturation pressure of 136 to 205 kPa (5 to 15 psig), and an i-octane concentration of 1. 0 v/w% based on the weight of coal...|$|E

The resulting agglomerates were recovered by screening. During a batch agglomeration test the progress of agglomeration was monitored by observing changes in agitator torque in the case of concentrated suspensions or by observing changes in turbidity in the case of dilute suspensions. Dilute suspensions were employed for investigating the kinetics of agglomeration, whereas concentrated suspensions were used for determining parameters that characterize the process of agglomeration.

Other important parameters included the projected area mean particle diameter of the agglomerates recovered at the end of a test as well as the ash content and yield of agglomerates. Batch agglomeration tests were conducted with geometrically similar mixing tanks which ranged in volume from 0. 346 to 11. 07 liters. Each tank was enclosed to control the amount of air present.
