A nonsense mutation that maps in one of the constitutive regions can be suppressed to wild type, “low-level ” constitutive, or “high-level ” constitutive phenotypes, depending on the amino acid inserted at the site of the mutation.

40|$|The Escherichia coli AraC protein represses and induces the araBAD operon in {{response}} to the absence or presence of L-arabinose. <b>Constitutive</b> <b>mutations</b> in the AraC gene no longer require the presence of L-arabinose to convert AraC from its repressing to its inducing state. Such mutations were isolated directly by virtue of their constitutivity or by their resistance to the nonmetabolizable arabinose analog, D-fucose. The majority of the <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutations</b> lie within the same residues of the N-terminal regulatory arm of AraC. Two, however, were found in the core of the dimerization domain.

40|$|A ribitol {{catabolic pathway}} was transduced into Escherichia coli K- 12 {{in an effort}} to {{determine}} whether the ribitol pathway would confer an advantage to D-arabinose-positive mutants growing on D-arabinose as the sole carbon source. Competition studies in chemostats showed that ribitol-positive strains, with a selection coefficient of 9 %/h, have a significant competitive advantage over ribitol-negative strains. Ribitol-positive strains grown in batch culture also exhibited a shorter lag period than did ribitol-negative strains when transferred from glucose to D-arabinose. Repeated transfer of a ribitol-positive strain of E. coli K- 12 on D-arabinose yielded a strain with further improved growth on D-arabinose. This "evolved" strain was found to constitutively synthesize L-fucose permease, isomerase, and kinase but had lost the ability to grow on L-fucose, apparently owing to the loss of a functional aldolase. This <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutation</b> is not linked to the fucose gene cluster and may be similar to an unlinked <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutation</b> described by Chen et al. (J.

40|$|We have {{selected}} 210 mutants {{able to grow}} on sucrose {{in the presence of}} 2 -deoxyglucose. We identified recessive mutations in three major complementation groups that cause constitutive (glucose-insensitive) secreted invertase synthesis. Two groups comprise alleles of the previously identified HXK 2 and REG 1 genes, and the third group was designated cid 1 (constitutive invertase derepression). The effect of cid 1 on SUC 2 expression is mediated by the SUC 2 upstream regulatory region, as judged by the constitutive expression of a SUC 2 -LEU 2 -lacZ fusion in which the LEU 2 promoter is under control of SUC 2 upstream sequences. A cid 1 mutation also causes glucose-insensitive expression of maltase. The previously isolated <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutation</b> ssn 6 is epistatic to cid 1, reg 1 and hxk 2 for very high level constitutive invertase expression. Mutations in SNF genes that prevent derepression of invertase are epistatic to cid 1, reg 1 and hxk 2; we have previously shown that ssn 6 has different epistasis relationships with snf mutations. The <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutation</b> tup 1 was found to resemble ssn 6 in its genetic interactions with snf mutations.

40|$|The phoP {{genetic locus}} is a two-component {{regulatory}} system (phoP-phoQ) {{that controls the}} expression of genes essential for Salmonella typhimurium virulence and survival within macrophages. Strains with a phoP <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutation</b> (phenotype PhoPC) showed up to 10 -fold greater expression of phoP-activated genes (pag loci) than did strains with a wild-type phoP locus (phenotype PhoP+). While the phoP <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutation</b> resulted in increased expression of pag loci, it also dramatically reduced the expression of other protein species. Comparison of the protein content of PhoP+ and PhoPC strains by two-dimensional protein gel electrophoresis demonstrated that at least 40 separate protein species were changed in expression {{as a result of}} this mutation. The PhoPC S. typhimurium were found to be attenuated for virulence and survival within macrophages. This finding suggests that a balanced PhoP-PhoQ regulatory response, which allows expression of phoP-repressed as well as -activated genes, is required for full virulence of S. typhimurium. We have further shown that small numbers of PhoPC bacteria can be used as a live attenuated vaccine to protect against mouse typhoid. As few as 15 PhoPC bacteria protected mice against challenge with 10 (5) 50 % lethal doses of wild-type organisms, suggesting that important protective antigens are regulated by the PhoP-PhoQ virulence regulon...|$|E
40|$|Among the {{beta-glucuronidase}} (UID) -constitutive mutants {{obtained by}} growth on methyl-beta-D-galacturonide, some strains are also derepressed {{for the two}} enzymes of the uxu operon: mannonate oxidoreductase (MOR) and mannonate hydrolyase (HLM). By conjugation and transduction experiments, two distinct <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutations</b> were separated in each pleiotropic mutant strain. One of them was specific for uidA gene expression and was characterized as affecting either uidO or uidR sites. The second type of mutation was mapped close to the uxu operon and {{was found to be}} responsible for the pleiotropic effect revealed in the primary mutants: after separation such a mutation still fully derepresses MOR and HLM synthesis but weakly derepresses UID synthesis. The pleiotropic effect of this mutation was maintained even though the activity of the structural genes was altered. This rules out the occurrence of an internal derepressing interaction between these enzymes. In merodiploid strains, uxu-linked <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutations</b> were recessive to the wild-type allele, suggesting that these mutations could affect a regulatory gene. The uxuR gene is probably a specific regulatory gene for a very close operon, uxu. Moreover, it has a weak effect on uidA expression. Thus, UID synthesis would be negatively controlled through the activity of two repressor molecules that are synthesized by two distinct regulatory genes, uidR and uxuR. These two repressing factors are antagonized, respectively, by phenyl-thio-beta-D-glucuronide and mannonic amide and could cooperate in a unique repression/induction control over uidA expression. <b>Constitutive</b> <b>mutations</b> affecting the control sites of uidA gene probably characterize two distinct attachment sites in the operator locus for each of the repressor molecules...|$|R
40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) {{is caused}} by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel, an ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter. CFTR gating is linked to ATP binding and dimerization of its two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). Channel activation also requires phosphorylation of the R domain by poorly understood mechanisms. Unlike conventional ligand-gated channels, CFTR is an ATPase for which ligand (ATP) release typically involves nucleotide hydrolysis. The extent to which CFTR gating conforms to classic allosteric schemes of ligand activation is unclear. Here, we describe point mutations in the CFTR cytosolic loops that markedly increase ATP-independent (constitutive) channel activity. This {{finding is consistent with}} an allosteric gating mechanism in which ligand shifts the equilibrium between inactive and active states but is not essential for channel opening. <b>Constitutive</b> <b>mutations</b> mapped to the putative symmetry axis of CFTR based on the crystal structures of related ABC transporters, a common theme for activating mutations in ligand-gated channels. Furthermore, the ATP sensitivity of channel activation was strongly enhanced by these <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutations,</b> as predicted for an allosteric mechanism (reciprocity between protein activation and ligand occupancy). Introducing <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutations</b> into CFTR channels that cannot open in response to ATP (i. e., the G 551 D CF mutant and an NBD 2 -deletion mutant) substantially rescued their activities. Importantly, constitutive mutants that opened without ATP or NBD 2 still required R domain phosphorylation for optimal activity. Our results confirm that (i) CFTR gating exhibits features of protein allostery that are shared with conventional ligand-gated channels and (ii) the R domain modulates CFTR activity independent of ATP-induced NBD dimerization...|$|R
40|$|The enzymes of the proline {{utilization}} pathway (the {{products of}} the PUT 1 and PUT 2 genes) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are coordinately regulated by proline and the PUT 3 transcriptional activator. To {{learn more about the}} control of this pathway, <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutations</b> in PUT 3 as well as in other regulators were sought. A scheme using a gene fusion between PUT 1 (S. cerevisiae proline oxidase) and galK (Escherichia coli galactokinase) was developed to select directly for <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutations</b> affecting the PUT 1 promoter. These mutations were secondarily screened for their effects in trans on the promoter of the PUT 2 (delta 1 -pyrroline- 5 -carboxylate dehydrogenase) gene by using a PUT 2 -lacZ (E. coli beta-galactosidase) gene fusion. Three different classes of mutations were isolated. The major class consisted of semidominant <b>constitutive</b> PUT 3 <b>mutations</b> that caused PUT 2 -lacZ expression to vary from 2 to 22 times the uninduced level. A single dominant mutation in a new locus called PUT 5 resulted in low-level constitutive expression of PUT 2 -lacZ; this mutation was epistatic to the recessive, noninducible put 3 - 75 allele. Recessive <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutations</b> were isolated that had pleiotropic growth defects; it is possible that these mutations are not specific to the proline utilization pathway but may be in genes that control several pathways. Since the PUT 3 gene appears to have {{a major role in the}} regulation of this pathway, a molecular analysis was undertaken. This gene was cloned by functional complementation of the put 3 - 75 mutation. Strains carrying a complete deletion of this gene are viable, proline nonutilizing, and indistinguishable in phenotype from the original put 3 - 75 allele. The PUT 3 gene encodes a 2. 8 -kilobase-pair transcript that is not regulated by proline at the level of RNA accumulation. The presence of the gene on a high-copy-number plasmid did not alter the regulation of one of its target genes, PUT 2 -lacZ, suggesting that the PUT 3 gene product is not limiting and that a titratable repressor is not involved in the regulation of this pathway...|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} {{significance of}} a lac operator <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutation</b> has been determined. The transition adenine-thymine to guanine-cytosine was {{shown to be a}} <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutation</b> simply because thymine contains the functionally important 5 -methyl group whereas cytosine does not. The remainder of the base pair is of no consequence. The experimental approach was to synthesize various modified operators containing cytosine, 5 -methyl-cytosine, and 5 -bromocytosine. The synthetic operator containing a guanine-cytosine base pair displays an eightfold reduction in stability with lac repressor whereas the operator containing 5 -methylcytosine binds repressor at least as tightly as does the wild type sequence. Results published previously have shown that a similar decrease in stability of the repressor-operator complex can be obtained simply by substituting uracil for thymine or by inverting the base pair to thymine-adenine. All these results taken together implicate the thymine 5 -methyl as the only important functional group recognized by the lac repressor at this base pair. Further confirmation of this conclusion was obtained by substitution of 5 -bromocytosine and 5 -bromouracil at this base pair. Both altered the stability of the repressor-operator complex by about the same percent suggesting that the bromine atom was the important determinant of complex stability for 5 -bromopyrimidine analogs...|$|E

Transcription of bvgAS-activated genes is nearly eliminated by several modulating conditions, including the presence of sulfate anion or nicotinic acid and growth at low temperature. We have isolated spontaneous mutations that result in the constitutive synthesis of multiple bvg-regulated loci. Several of these mutations have been analyzed and were found to result from single-nucleotide substitutions within bvgS, in a region encoding a 161 -amino-acid segment which links the transmembrane sequence with cytoplasmic domains {{that appear to be}} involved in signaling events. The effect of signal transduction mutations in Escherichia coli was determined by measuring the expression of an fhaB-lacZYA transcriptional fusion, and that in B. pertussis was determined by measuring expression of both fhaB-cat and ptxA 3201 -cat fusions. The <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutations</b> have little effect on fhaB-cat or fhaB-lacZYA expression in the absence of modulating signals but result in a nearly complete insensitivity to MgSO 4, nicotinic acid, or growth at low temperature.

The nucleotide sequence of the qa- 1 S gene and its flanking regions has been determined. The deduced coding sequence for the qa- 1 S protein encodes 918 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 100, 650 and is interrupted by a single 66 -base-pair intervening sequence.

Results The proband was a carrier of a novel RB 1 <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutation</b> (g. 2056 C>G) which was not detected in her father or her unaffected sisters, and of two other mutations (g. 39606 C>T and g. 174351 T>A) also present in two monozygotic sisters. The novel mutation probably occurred de novo while the others were of likely maternal origin. The novel mutation, affecting the Kozak consensus at the 5 'UTR of RB 1 and g. 174351 T>A were likely associated to retinoblastoma in the proband. Conclusion Molecular diagnosis of retinoblastoma requires genotypic data of the family for determining hereditary transmission. In the case of children generated by IVF with oocytes from an anonymous donor which had been stored in a cell repository, this might not be successfully accomplished, making precise diagnosis impracticable for genetic counseling. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of axonal tracts requires interactions between growth cones and the environment. Major bundles, {{particularly in the}} internal capsule, are completely defective in mice with <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutation</b> of Celsr 3. In order to understand better how Celsr 3 controls axonal tract formation, we generated a conditional allele that allowed inactivation of Celsr 3 in different sectors of the forebrain. Effects of Celsr 3 inactivation specifically in the telencephalon, in the ventral forebrain, or in the cortex, demonstrate essential roles for the gene, both in the neurons that project their axons to subcerebral targets such as the spinal cord, {{as well as in}} cells that guide projecting axons through the ventral forebrain. These observations provide unequivocal in vivo evidence that heterotypic interactions between axons and guidepost cells govern axonal path formation in mammals, and that Celsr 3 {{plays a key role in}} this process. In absence of cortico-subcortical connections, mice can survive up to P 20, allowing studies of behavior and cortical maturation. Mutant mice with defective corticospinal tracts survive normally and provide a model to evaluate in vivo the role of this tract in motor function in rodents...|$|E
40|$|AraC protein, the {{regulator}} of the L-arabinose operon in Escherichia coli has been postulated to function by a light switch mechanism. According to this mechanism, {{it should be}} possible to ®nd mutations in the DNAbinding domain of AraC that result in weaker arm-DNA-binding domain interactions and which make the protein constitutive, that is, it no longer requires arabinose to activate transcription. We isolated such mutations by randomizing three contiguous leucine residues in the DNA-binding domain, and then by systematically scanning surface residues of the DNA-binding domain with alanine and glutamic acid. As a result, a total of 20 <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutations</b> were found at ten different positions. They form a contiguous trail on the DNA-distal face of the DNA-binding domain, and likely de®ne the region where the N-terminal arm that extends from the N-terminal dimerization domain contacts the C-terminal DNA-binding domain...|$|R
40|$|<b>Constitutive</b> <b>mutations</b> were {{sought and}} {{found in the}} N-terminal arm of the Escherichia coli {{regulatory}} protein of the arabinose operon, AraC protein. A new mutation, N 16 D, was of particular interest. Asn- 16 is not seen in the crystal structure of the AraC dimerization domain determined {{in the absence of}} arabinose, because the N-terminal arm 18 residues are disordered, but in the presence of arabinose, residues 7 – 18 fold over the arabinose and make many interactions with it. In this state Asn- 16 lies near two positively charged amino acids, Lys- 43 and Arg- 99. We propose that the introduction of the negatively charged aspartic residue at position 16 creates a charge-charge interaction network among Asp- 16, Lys- 43, and Arg- 99 that holds the arm to the dimerization domain {{even in the absence of}} arabinose...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{relative}} contributions of genetic and environmental factors to the development of gastric cancer. Mutations in the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin are recognized {{to be associated with the}} development of undifferentiated, diffuse and invasive gastric cancers. A recent study of two gastric cancer families has shown that germline mutations in the E-cadherin gene can be causative (Guilford P et al, Nature 1998; 26 : 402 – 405). We have examined the E-cadherin gene for <b>constitutive</b> <b>mutations</b> in a systematic series of 106 gastric cancer patients, 10 with a family history of the disease and 96 sporadic cases. No pathogenic mutations were observed in any of the 106 patients. The results indicate that germline mutations in E-cadherin will not account for more than 3 % of gastric cancers. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R
