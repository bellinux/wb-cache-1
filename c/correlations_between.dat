A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides factor analysis of responses to questions about, , the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The study shows significant weighted <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs and how conservative such religious beliefs are. The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes emit on the {{electromagnetic}} spectrum, with sferics and E-field effects detected. There are observed <b>correlations</b> <b>between</b> tornadoes {{and patterns of}} lightning. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning at all. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado touches the surface {{and returns to the}} baseline level when the tornado dissipates. In many cases, intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges. Electromagnetics and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a thermodynamic phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} : (1) the <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> self concept and students’ motivation at English students of cokroaminoto palopo, (2) the <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> peer group environment and students’ motivation, (3) the <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> self concept and English proficiency, (4) the <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> peer group environment and English proficiency. The research used correlational design. The population was the sixth semester of English Departement of Cokroaminoto Palopo. The sample was selected by random sampling. The collection of the data was done by using questionnaire and TOEFL test. The result of the research showed that (1) there was significant <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> self concept and students motivation; (2) there was significant <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> peer group environment and students’ motivation; (3) there was not significant <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> self concept and English proficiency; (4) there was not significant <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> peer group environment and English proficiency. It was concluded that the <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> self concept and students’ motivation and the <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> peer group environment and students’ motivation are significant. The significant was smaller than 0. 05. it indicated that (1) if self concept increases, students motivation also increase, (2) if peer group environment increases, students’ motivation also increase. Then, The <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> self concept and English proficiency and the <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> peer group environment and english proficiency are low. the significant was higher that 0. 05. It indicated that if English self concept increase, It doesn’t mean that English proficiency also increase, and also if peer group environment increase, it doesn’t mean English proficiency increase...|$|R
