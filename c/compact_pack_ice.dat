40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Generally good agreement {{has been observed}} between the location of ice edges and ice concentrations as indicated on aerial observation charts and as mapped from ERTS- 1 imagery. Moreover, ice surface features reported to be ridges and thaw holes are readily detected in the ERTS- 1 imagery. Reported hummocks, puddles, frozen puddles, and rafted ice are not as readily detected in the imagery, although brightness variations on some ice surfaces can be distinguished, thereby suggesting their presence. In the ERTS- 1 imagery, although dark new ice and nilas are difficult to detect, other younger forms of ice can be mapped and can usually be distinguished from older ice because of their lower, more uniform reflectance. A preliminary examination of the initial sample of ERTS- 1 imagery collected during the spring, during the season of maximum ice extend, indicates several ice features of interest. <b>Compact</b> <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> can be distinguished from coastal fast ice, and many leads can be mapped, even in the mid-Beaufort Sea.

500|$|During {{the first}} half of each year the waters off Newfoundland may become covered with floes of sea ice or [...] "pack ice".

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{seasonal}} formation/melting process of <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> on the PCB level of sea water at Gerlache Inlet and Wood Bay (Ross Sea, Antarctica) was investigated during four Italian expeditions, i. e. ! 988 - 89, 1990 - 91, 1991 - 92 and 1993 - 94. Surface sea water samples from Gerlache Inlet and Wood Bay before <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> melting showed a typical total PCB concentration of 133 pg/l and 120 pg/l, respectively, which increased {{by a factor}} of about 1. 3 in both sampling sites during <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> melting. This effect was attributed to the transfer of PCBs contained in the <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> to sea water, and salinity was used as a tracer to verify this hypothesis. In this respect, <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> and sea water samples were collected during the 1993 - 94 Italian expedition, and both salinity (S) and PCB content were measured. A fairly good agreement was observed between the experimental PCB concentration and the value calculated by the dilution model which was applied to the mixing process between sea and <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> melting waters.

The algal groups haptophytes, dinoflagellates and diatoms were identified in surface, interior and bottom assemblages in the <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> cores using the photosynthetic marker pigments 19 '-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin (HEX), peridinin (PER) and fucoxanthin (FUC), respectively. DMSP concentrations were significantly correlated (P< 0. 01, Pearson) with chlorophyll-a (r= 0. 58), HEX (r= 0. 75), PER (r= 0. 79) and FUC (r= 0. 63) concentrations. The pool of DMSP within the <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> (mean 107 nM) was contributed mainly by interior and bottom algal assemblages (mean 94 and 268 nM, respectively), whilst the surface algal assemblages were minor contributors (mean 18 nM).
