50|$|This film is {{interesting}} because it contains the first example, of several, now common, cinematic techniques: camera angle, long <b>shot,</b> <b>medium</b> <b>shot,</b> close-up, and forced perspective.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Medium</b> <b>shots</b> are favored in {{sequences}} where dialogues or a {{small group}} of people are acting, as they give the viewer a partial view of the background and also show the subjects' facial expressions in the context of their body language. <b>Medium</b> <b>shots</b> are also used when the subject in the shot is delivering information, such as news presenters. It is also used in interviews. It is the most common shot in movies, and it usually follows the first establishing shots of a new scene or location.|$|R
50|$|<b>Medium</b> <b>shots</b> {{are divided}} into singles (a waist-high shot of one actor), group shots, over-the {{shoulders}} or two-shots (featuring two people).

50|$|Cuts {{serve as}} {{transitions}} between camera angles, {{such a wide}} establishing <b>shot</b> and a <b>medium</b> <b>shot.</b> Footage of a moving character may be captured from multiple angles rather than a tracking shot, either for aesthetic reasons or to lessen the risk of damaging a camera while in motion.|$|R
30|$|The {{production}} process of sports videos also has certain rules {{that can be}} used to analyze video content. Ekin et al. studied the scenes of sports videos. They first divided the shots into distant <b>shots,</b> <b>medium</b> <b>shots,</b> close-ups shots, and off-site shots based on the main color distribution of the video images. For the semantic understanding of video content, many researchers start from the wonderful event detection of video and expand the semantic analysis of video content [3].|$|R
50|$|The 30 degree {{change of}} {{perspective}} makes the shots different {{enough to avoid}} a jump cut. Too much movement around the subject may violate the 180-degree rule. Following this rule may soften the effect of changing shot distance, such as changing from a <b>medium</b> <b>shot</b> to a close-up or extreme close-up.|$|R

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} February 2006, {{under the supervision}} of the 3D cinematographer Peter Anderson; two shows were filmed in Mexico City to capture <b>medium</b> <b>shots</b> during a practice run for the crew to learn the choreography of U2's performances. The crew captured additional <b>medium</b> <b>shots</b> using two camera setups at the two São Paulo concerts, and captured overhead footage of drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. using a single camera setup at the show in Santiago. During preparations for the Buenos Aires concerts, U2 performed a 10-song set without an audience, so that the crew could capture close-up footage using a wide-angle lens; doing so in-concert would have interfered with the show. Owens dubbed the session the [...] "phantom shoot". During the Buenos Aires shows, all nine camera setups were used, capturing shots of U2 from the B-stages.
