25|$|Some {{aspects of}} vacuum {{structure}} in light-front quantization {{can be analyzed}} by studying properties of massive states. In particular, by studying the appearance of degeneracies among the lowest massive states, one can determine the critical <b>coupling</b> <b>strength</b> associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. One can also use a limiting process, where the analysis begins in equal-time quantization but arrives in light-front coordinates as the limit of some chosen parameter. A much more direct approach is to include modes of zero longitudinal momentum (zero modes) in a calculation of a nontrivial light-front vacuum built from these modes; the Hamiltonian then contains effective interactions that determine the vacuum structure and provide for zero-mode exchange interactions between constituents of massive states.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this article}} we study {{synchronization}} of Ku-ramoto oscillators with heterogeneous frequencies, and where underlying topology is a graph of diameter two. When the <b>coupling</b> <b>strengths</b> between every two connected oscillators are the same, we find an analytic condition that guarantees an existence of a Positively Invariant Set (PIS) and demonstrate that existence of a PIS suffices for frequency synchronization. For graphs of diameter two, this synchronization condition is significantly better than existing general conditions for an arbitrary topology. If the <b>coupling</b> <b>strengths</b> can be different for different pairs of connected oscillators, we formulate an optimization problem that finds sufficient for synchronization <b>coupling</b> <b>strengths</b> such that their sum is minimal.

30|$|Remark 1 Recently, complex {{dynamical}} networks with time-varying or constant <b>coupling</b> <b>strengths</b> {{have attracted}} much attention from researchers in different areas, such as physical science, engineering, mathematics, biology, and so on [28 – 30]. There are many interesting collective phenomena in complex dynamical networks that can be described by coupled differential equation equations, such as self-organization, synchronization, spatiotemporal chaos and so on. Particularly, the synchronization phenomena have actively been investigated due to past physics and potential engineering application, secure communication, and so on [28 – 30, 34 – 37]. Although some methods have been developed {{in the field of}} complex networks, only a few of them are concerning time-varying <b>coupling</b> <b>strengths.</b> To the best of our knowledge, up to now, little work is reported on the synchronization of stochastic RDNNs with unknown time-varying delays and unknown time-varying <b>coupling</b> <b>strengths.</b> In this paper, using adaptive learning method on periodic <b>coupling</b> <b>strengths,</b> the synchronization of stochastic delayed RDNNs will be considered.|$|R
