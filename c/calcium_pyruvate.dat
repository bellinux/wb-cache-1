40|$|Objective: We {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} <b>calcium</b> <b>pyruvate</b> supplementation during training on body composition and metabolic responses to exercise. Method: Twenty-three untrained females were matched and assigned to ingest in a double blind and randomized manner either 5 g of <b>calcium</b> <b>pyruvate</b> (PYR) or a placebo (PL) twice daily for 30 d while participating in a supervised exercise program. Prior to and following supplementation, subjects had body composition determined via hydrodensiometry; performed a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test; and performed a 45 -min walk test at 70 % of pre-training VO 2 max in which fasting pre- and post exercise blood samples determined. Results: No significant differences were observed between groups in energy intake or training volume. Univariate repeated measures ANOVA revealed that subjects in the PYR group gained less weight (PL 1. 2 ± 0. 3, PYR 0. 3 ± 0. 3 kg, P = 0. 04), lost more fat (PL 1. 1 ± 0. 5; PYR − 0. 4 ± 0. 5 kg, P = 0. 03), and tended to lose {{a greater percentage of}} body fat (PL 1. 0 ± 0. 7; PYR − 0. 65 ± 0. 6 %, P = 0. 07), with no differences observed in fat-free mass (PL 0. 1 ± 0. 5; PYR 0. 7 ± 0. 3 kg, P = 0. 29). However, these changes were not significant when body composition data were analyzed by MANOVA (P = 0. 16). There was some evidence that PYR may negate some of the beneficial effects of exercise on HDL values. No significant differences were observed between groups in maximal exercise responses or metabolic responses to submaximal walking. Conclusions: Results indicate that PYR supplementation during training does not significantly affect body composition or exercise performance and may negatively affect some blood lipid levels...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE: We {{examined}} the effects of a commercially marketed herbal-based formula purported to increase endurance on oxygen consumption (VO 2) in 17 competitive category III/IV amateur cyclists [mean (SEM) age: 31. 1 (1. 8) yr; height: 178. 5 (1. 8) cm; weight: 77. 1 (1. 6) kg]. METHODS: Each cyclist participated in two (pre/post) cycling tests progressing 25 W. 4 min(- 1) starting at 100 W administered in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind fashion. The second trial was performed 14 d after the ingestion of a manufacturer recommended loading phase (4 d x 6 caps. d(- 1)) and a maintenance phase (11 d x 3 caps. d(- 1)). Three treatment capsules contained 1000 mg of Cordyceps sinensis (CS- 4) and 300 mg Rhodiola rosea root extract as the primary ingredients; 800 mg of other ingredients included <b>calcium</b> <b>pyruvate,</b> sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, ribose, and adenosine and 200 mcg of chromium. RESULTS: Using a 2 x 2 ANOVA, we observed no significant treatment effect for any between or within group variables including peak VO 2 [treatment 4. 14 (0. 2) L. min(- 1); placebo 4. 10 (0. 2) L. min(- 1) ], time to exhaustion [treatment 38. 47 (1. 7) min; placebo 36. 95 (1. 8) min], peak power output (PO) [treatment 300. 00 (12. 1) W; placebo 290. 63 (12. 9) W], or peak heart rate. We also observed no differences for any subpeak exercise variable including the PO eliciting 2 mmol. L(- 1) blood lactate (BLa) [treatment 201. 00 (18. 1) W; placebo 167. 50 (19. 2) W] and 4 mmol. L(- 1) BLa [treatment 235. 88 (15. 8) W; placebo 244. 78 (14. 9) W], ventilatory threshold, respiratory compensation point, or Vo 2 L. min(- 1) gross efficiency at each stage. CONCLUSION: A 2 -wk ingestion schema of a commercial herbal-based formula is insufficient to elicit positive changes in cycling performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), as controlled by reversible phosphorylation, was studied in situ with mitochondria oxidizing dfifferent substrates. PDCs from both plant and animal tissues were inactivated when pyruvate became limiting. The PDC did not inactivate {{in the presence of}} saturating levels of <b>pyruvate.</b> <b>Calcium</b> stimulated reactivation of PDC in chicken heart but not pea (Pisum sativum L.) leaf mitochondria. With pea leaf mitochondria oxidizing malate, inactivation of PDC was pH dependent corresponding to the production of pyruvate via malic enzyme. When pea leaf mitochondria oxidized succinate or glycine, PDC was inactivated. This inactivation was reversed by the addition of pyruvate. Reactivation by pyruvate was enhanced by the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate, as previously observed with nonrespiring mitochondria. These results indicate a major role for pyruvate in regulating the covalent modification of the PDC...|$|R
40|$|Pyruvate is a {{metabolic}} fuel {{that is a}} potent inotropic agent. Despite its unique inotropic and antioxidant properties, the molecular mechanism of its inotropic mechanism is still largely unknown. To examine the inotropic effect of pyruvate in parallel with intracellular calcium handling under near physiological conditions, we measured pH, myofilament calcium sensitivity, developed force, and calcium transients in ultra thin rabbit heart trabeculae at 37 °C loaded iontophoretically with the calcium indicator bis-fura- 2. By contrasting conditions of control versus sarcoplasmic reticulum block (with either cyclopiazonic acid and ryanodine or with thapsigargin) {{we were able to}} characterize and isolate the effects of pyruvate on sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium handling and developed force. A potassium contracture technique was subsequently utilized to assess the force-calcium relationship and thus the myofilament <b>calcium</b> sensitivity. <b>Pyruvate</b> consistently increased developed force whether or not the sarcoplasmic reticulum was blocked (16. 8 ± 3. 5 to 24. 5 ± 5. 1 vs. 6. 9 ± 2. 6 to 12. 5 ± 4. 4 mN/mm(2), non-blocked vs. blocked sarcoplasmic reticulum respectively, p< 0. 001, n =  9). Furthermore, the sensitizing effect of pyruvate on the myofilaments was demonstrated by potassium contractures (EC 50 at baseline versus 20 minutes of pyruvate infusion (peak force development) was 701 ± 94 vs. 445 ± 65 nM, p< 0. 01, n =  6). This study is the first to demonstrate that a leftward shift in myofilament calcium sensitivity is an important mediator of the inotropic effect of pyruvate. This finding can have important implications for future development of therapeutic strategies in the management of heart failure...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{aluminum}} (Al) on plasma vitellogenin (VTG), alkaline-labile phosphorus (ALPP), <b>calcium</b> (Ca), glutamate <b>pyruvate</b> transaminase (GPT), the hepatosomatic index (HSI), and hepatic Al concentration {{were examined in}} estradiol- 17 β (E 2) -adminis-tered immature rockfish Sebastes schlegeli. Fish were injected intraperitoneally with E 2 (5 mg/kg body weight [BW]) and/or Al (0, 0. 1, 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg BW) and plasma and liver samples were extracted 7 days later. After sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacryl-amide gel electrophoresis, the relative amount of VTG was determined by integrated optical density. VTG accounted for 23. 6 % of the total proteins in the control group, but this value decreased with increasing Al administration. Al reduced the concentrations of ALPP and Ca in a concentration-dependent manner and significant reduction occurred at Al concentrations greater than 5 mg/kg. The concentration of GPT increased in a concentration-dependent manner in all Al-administered rockfish. The concentrations of Al in the liver also increased, and HSI was decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that Al inhibits E 2 -induced VTG production by being toxic to hepatocytes in marine fish...|$|R

Since the mitochondria are the main site of substrate oxidation, ROS production and programmed cell death, we tried {{to know whether the}} cellular disorders encountered in sarcopenia are due to abnormal mitochondrial functioning. Gastrocnemius mitochondria were extracted from adult (6 months) and aged (21 months) male Wistar rats. Respiration parameters, opening of the permeability transition pore and ROS production, with either glutamate (amino acid metabolism) or pyruvate (glucose metabolism) as a respiration substrate, were evaluated at different matrix <b>calcium</b> concentrations. <b>Pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase and respiratory complex activities as well as their contents measured by Western blotting analysis were determined. Furthermore, the fatty acid profile of mitochondrial phospholipids was also measured. At physiological calcium concentration, state III respiration rate was lowered by aging in pyruvate conditions (- 22 %), but not with glutamate. The reduction of pyruvate oxidation resulted from a calcium-dependent inactivation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase system and could provide for the well-known proteolysis encountered during sarcopenia. Matrix calcium loading and aging increased ROS production. They also reduced the oxidative phosphorylation. This was associated with lower calcium retention capacities, suggesting that sarcopenic fibers are more prone to programmed cell death. Aging was also associated with a reduced mitochondrial superoxide dismutase activity, which does not intervene in toxic ROS overproduction but could explain the lower calcium retention capacities. Despite a lower content, cytochrome c oxidase displayed an increased activity associated with an increased n- 6 /n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio of mitochondrial phospholipids. In conclusion, we propose that mitochondria obtained from aged muscle fibers display several functional abnormalities explaining the increased proteolysis, ROS overproduction and vulnerability to apoptosis exhibited by sarcopenic muscle. These changes appear to be related to modifications of the fatty acid profile of mitochondrial lipids...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Besides viral serotype, HLA {{haplotype}} and cytokine genes polymorphism {{are associated}} with clinical presentation of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Since these analyses are unavailable in routine clinical practice, {{the aim of this}} study was to assess clinical, laboratory and radiographic findings associated with clinical presentation of disease severity. Methods. A total of 30 patients (27 men and 3 women), average age 40 ± 14. 9 years, treated for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2009 in Clinical Center of Serbia, were included in the study. Nine patients (30 %) had mild, 14 (46. 7 %) moderate and 7 (23. 3 %) severe form of the disease; 24 (80 %) recovered, 6 (20 %) died in the acute phase of the illness, and 19 patients (63. 3 %) required hemodialysis. Results. The average titer of antiviral antibodies in patients infected with Belgrade serotype virus were significantly higher in those with severe clinical presentation. Hypotension, anuria, macrohaematuria, pulmonary infiltration, pleural effusion, hepatomegalia and positive meningeal signs were more frequent in the patients with severe form of the disease. Statistically significant differences between groups with mild, moderate and severe clinical picture were found in serum total protein, albumin, <b>calcium,</b> glutamate <b>pyruvate</b> and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase on admittance; serum creatinine and phosphorus concentration on day 14 and day 21; serum sodium and calciums on day 14; hemoglobine concentration on day 21. A statistically significant correlation was found between clinical presentation of the disease severity and platelet count, white blood cell count, hemoglobine concentration, serum calcium and serum transaminases on admittance. Multivariate analysis identified variables` combinations associated with clinical presentation of the disease. Conclusion. Our study confirmed that we can distinguish patients who will manifest different severities of the disease on the basis of careful consideration of laboratory and clinical findings on admission...|$|R

40|$|During {{a period}} of ischaemia, the {{myocardium}} switches predominantly from fatty acid metabolism to anaerobic glycolysis {{in an effort to}} maintain ATP levels. Increased availability of the metabolic substrates glucose and pyruvate has been found to improve recovery following ischaemia and reperfusion, while the presence of fatty acids upon reperfusion is detrimental. This study used isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes exposed to a simulated ischaemic and reperfusion protocol (metabolic inhibition and re-energisation) to investigate the effects of acute changes in specific metabolic substrates, and concentrations, prior to metabolic inhibition and/or during re-energisation at a cellular level. Perfusing isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes with an elevated concentration of glucose or fructose prior to metabolic inhibition and during re-energisation reduced a number of markers of ischaemic and re-energisation injury and thus imparted cardioprotection. Elevated glucose also affected electrical activity of the isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes by delaying action potential failure and SarcKATP channel activation. Intracellular magnesium levels were maintained with elevated glucose indicating possible sustained ATP levels, while intracellular calcium levels continued to rise throughout the protocol, suggesting the observed cardioprotection is not linked to reduced <b>calcium</b> overloading. Reducing <b>pyruvate</b> to a physiological concentration (0. 5 mM) only impacting on the response to metabolic inhibition, whilst elevating pyruvate to a supraphysiological concentration (10 mM), only benefited those cardiomyocytes perfused under normoglycaemic conditions. Perfusion with a physiological concentration (0. 5 mM) of octanoate abrogated the cardioprotection 6 provided by elevated glucose upon re-energisation. Metabolic preconditioning and postconditioning with elevated concentrations of metabolic substrates also improved contractile recovery. These results suggest increased availability of certain metabolic substrates are beneficial to isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes either prior to metabolic inhibition and/or the subsequent re-energisation. These observations may have clinical relevance in patients with acute coronary ischaemia. The precise mechanisms for these effects remain to be determined but are suggested to involve increased ATP availability...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to establish the dynamics of electrolyte balance, pyruvate and lactate in patients with arterial hypertension (AH), long QT syndrome and heart rate turbulence. Materials and methods. The study included 60 patients with stage II AH. All patients were divided into three groups: Group I included 20 patients with stage II AH and normal myocardial electrical stability; Group II included 20 patients with stage II AH and long QT syndrome (LQTS); Group III comprised 20 patients with stage II AH and heart rate turbulence (HRT). The control group included 20 practically healthy persons. The parameters of heart rate turbulence, QT-interval duration, potassium, magnesium, <b>calcium,</b> lactate and <b>pyruvate</b> levels were determined. Results. A total calcium level in patients of Groups II and III increased by 27. 14 % (p< 0. 001) and 29. 41 % (p< 0. 001) compared to Group I, and ionized calcium level increased by 27. 14 % (p< 0. 001) and 27. 65 % (p< 0. 001), respectively. The level of potassium in Groups II and III was 20. 63 % (p< 0. 001) and 19. 59 % (p< 0. 001) lower than in Group I, and magnesium level was 14. 51 % (p< 0. 001) and 12. 69 % (p< 0. 001) lower compared to Group I. The level of pyruvate in Group II decreased by 60. 53 % (p< 0. 001), and in Group III it decreased by 54. 84 % (p< 0. 001). The level of lactate increased by 27. 01 % (p< 0. 001) and 25. 24 % (p< 0. 001), respectively. Conclusions. Considering the obtained results, deeper investigation {{of the role of}} electrolyte balance in the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension and myocardial electrical instability should be continued. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the article}} data are {{presented}} on {{dynamics of the}} level of indicators of metabolic profile of blood serum of race horses of the Ukrainian riding breed in the conditions of physical and emotional loading. Clinically healthy race horses were the object of  research. Blood was taken from the jugular vein to obtain serum and for further biochemical research. For the research 12 race horses from a training group were chosen. From time to time the animals took part in competitions; they were not specially used in races and were mostly used for the training of junior riders and sportsmen of different levels. Blood was taken in conditions of relative rest after ordinary training and after emotional stress during the entertainment performances when {{a large number of people}} were present and loud music was played. In the blood serum the following biochemical indicators were defined: whole protein, urea, creatinine, uric acid, total bilirubin and its fractions, glucose, cholestererol, triacylglycerol, <b>calcium,</b> ferrum, lactate, <b>pyruvate,</b> activity of the AlAT, SGOT, GGTP, LDH, an alkaline phosphatase – which makes it possible to determine reasonably accurately the adaptation potential of a horse under various types of loading. We established that during training and psychoemotional loading of racing horses of the training group of the Ukrainian riding breed, multidirectional changes in the level of biochemical indicators of blood serum occurred, which is evidence of stress in the metabolic processes in the animals’ organisms. Concentration of a biomarker of an oxidative stress, uric acid, increased after physical loading by 8. 6 %, and after emotional loading by 55. 1 %, which demonstrates that emotional stress had the more negative effect, indicating insufficient adaptation by the horses before demonstration performances. After physical loading, reaction of transamination in the horses’ liver cells intensified, and after emotional loading its intensity decreased, which conforms to changes of indicators in exchange of proteins. SGOT activity in the animals’ blood serum exceeded the upper rate of norm, it coincides also with rising of concentration of creatinine and sodium lactatum, and is an indicator of intensification of catabolic processes in the muscles after physical loading. Only after emotional loading, did hyperglycemia and hyperbilirubinemia occur because of a temporal spasm in the cholic paths without changes in the activity of the alkaline phosphatase and GGTP. After physical loading the level of lactatum increased (by 185. 7 %), activity of LDH (by 76. 2 %), concentration of cholesterol (by  76. 2 %), triacylglycerol (by 140. 9 %), which is an indicator of intensification of anaerobic glycolysis and lipolysis. Emotional loading is the stronger stress factor which causes negative changes in indicators of the metabolic profile. Trainers should take this into account during the training and testing of horses in order to facilitate their adaptation to the influence of various stress factors, to correct the animals’ physiological state and thus enable them to cope with intensive loading without threat to their health...|$|R
