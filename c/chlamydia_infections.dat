40|$|Abstract Background <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>infection</b> {{in acute}} pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease (PID) is associated with serious complications including ectopic pregnancy, tubal infertility, Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome and tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA). This study compared clinical and laboratory data between PID with and without <b>chlamydia</b> <b>infection.</b> Methods The medical records of 497 women who were admitted with PID between 2002 and 2011 were reviewed. The patients {{were divided into two}} groups (PID with and without <b>chlamydia</b> <b>infection),</b> which were compared in terms of the patients 2 ̆ 019 characteristics, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings, including inflammatory markers. Results The chlamydia and non-chlamydia groups comprised 175 and 322 women, respectively. The patients in the chlamydia group were younger and had a higher rate of TOA, a longer mean hospital stay, and had undergone more surgeries than the patients in the non- chlamydia group. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and CA- 125 level were higher in the chlamydia group than in the non-chlamydia group, but {{there was no significant difference}} in the white blood cell count between the two groups. The CA- 125 level was the strongest predictor of <b>chlamydia</b> <b>infection,</b> followed by the ESR and CRP level.

Chlamydia trachomatis plays an important role in disease such as salpingitis and urethritis, cervicitis, premature rupture of membrane, neonatal infection while passing through the vaginal canal, infertility and ectopic pregnancy. This study was designed to investigate the ptevalence of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>infection</b> among the pregnant women who were referred to one of the perinatal clinics of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Materials and Methods : This researcg included 400 pregnant women who had been selected by a two-stage program form the women referring to perinatal care clinics to Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The mean for gathering data was a questionnare contained demograpgical and socioeconomic questions. Samples of cervical discharge and serum examined by direct immunogluorescence and microimmunofluorescence techniques. Results : The prevalence of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>infection</b> among women referring to these perinatal care clinics was about 2. 75 percent. Among 400 samles of cervical discharge examined by microimmunofluorescence technique, IgG and secretory IGA titers exceeding 1 : 8 were found in 8 women (2 %) indicating active <b>infection</b> with <b>Chlamydia</b> trachomatis.

Objectives: This study aims to report the prevalence of <b>Chlamydia</b> trachomatis <b>infection</b> among infertile women in Saudi Arabia. Patients and methods: A community-based study carried out at the obstetrics and gynecology clinic at Jazan General Hospital, Saudi Arabia. The study group included 640 Saudi infertile women who were aged between 18 and 40 years and who attended the gynecology clinic for infertility examination throughout 1 year of study (from July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012). The randomized control group included 100 Saudi fertile women who attended the obstetrics clinic for routine antenatal care. All recruited women were screened for <b>chlamydia</b> <b>infection</b> by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of serum-specific antibodies and then retested by the McCoy cell culture technique. Results: The prevalence of <b>Chlamydia</b> trachomatis <b>infection</b> among infertile women was high, at 15. 0 %.

40|$|There {{was defined}} the {{stability}} of the obtained positive results after treatment in patients with generalized periodontitis with concomitant chronic <b>chlamydia</b> <b>infection.</b> There were performed clinical, instrumental and laboratory examinations of 35 patients with chronic generalized periodontitis and verified <b>chlamydia</b> <b>infection,</b> who were administered the drug Proteflazid internally and locally. The control group consisted of 29 patients with stages I-II chronic GP and concomitant <b>chlamydia</b> <b>infection,</b> who received conventional treatment. Clinical, instrumental and laboratory examinations of patients in both groups were performed at 1, 6 and 12 months of treatment and included: determination of the periodontal pockets’ depth, Sulcus Bleeding Index (SBI, Mühlemann), PMA index, Periodontal Disease Index (PDI, Ramfjord), hygiene index (OHI-S), carrying out of Yasinovky’s test; NBT-test and calculation of  leukocyte intoxication index.
