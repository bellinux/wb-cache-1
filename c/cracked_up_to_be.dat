Napier wrote that if a conclusion is to be reached based on scant extant [...] "'hard' evidence," [...] science must declare [...] "Bigfoot does not exist." [...] However, he {{found it difficult to}} entirely reject thousands of alleged tracks, [...] "scattered over 125,000 square miles" [...] (325,000km²) or to dismiss all [...] "the many hundreds" [...] of eyewitness accounts. Napier concluded, [...] "I am convinced that Sasquatch exists, but whether it is all it is <b>cracked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> is another matter altogether. There must be something in north-west America that needs explaining, and that something leaves man-like footprints." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a real-time {{relation between the}} evolution of fluid permeability and the crack width opening in a saturated concrete sample. The standard Brazilian test has been enhanced so that one single controlled <b>crack</b> (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 300 μm) <b>is</b> generated in the specimen. The procedure has been then adapted so that the simultaneous monitoring of the cracking process {{and the evolution of}} a fluid flow through the specimen are possible. Poiseulle's cubic law is commonly used in numerical analyses for describing the percolation of a fluid in a crack: this law is then corrected accordingly to our experimental observations thus taking into account the actual morphology of the opening crack. The effect {{of the size of the}} specimen (diameter and thickness) on the percolation process as well as threshold effect are also investigated and discussed...|$|R
5000|$|In {{its initial}} request to wiretap the telephone, the FBI listed Peter Gotti and Richard Gotti as loanshark {{collectors}} {{and stated that}} Angelo was a [...] "known murderer who would, without question, seek physical retribution and possibly murder a shylock victim who <b>is</b> unable <b>to</b> pay his debts." [...] Somehow Angelo found out that agents had <b>been</b> listening <b>to</b> him and went into hiding. The affidavit caused panic and deception within the Dellacroce-Gotti faction regime and the Paul Castellano loyalists in the Gambino crime family, whose titular boss equated drug dealing with death. Somehow, sometime in late June 1985, the Bergin crew finally demonstrated it could get accurate information. Angelo obtained a pasted-together version {{of the last of}} the FBI's six Angelo electronic-surveillance affidavits. The notes told him that FBI Agent John Conroy was not all he <b>cracked</b> himself <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> and that attorney Michael Coiro was not wired into the Eastern District as he imagined. Critically, the FBI working papers confirmed the depth of the probe, and that it was supported by a three-bug invasion of his home. Sources advised Angelo Ruggiero became scared to death because he had <b>been</b> lying systematically <b>to</b> Paul Castellano and his uncle Aniello Dellacroce insofar as he had constantly told them that he had not been dealing in drugs by himself, by merely cleaning up loose ends of his brother Salvatore's narcotics operation.|$|R
40|$|As {{concrete}} cracks {{due to its}} low {{tensile strength}} and as harmful fluids may migrate into these cracks, the durability of concrete is endangered if no proper treatment or manual repair <b>is</b> applied. <b>To</b> address this need, this research focusses {{on the use of}} superabsorbent polymers (1) to seal cracks from intruding potentially harmful substances and (2) to heal the crack due to further hydration and precipitation of calcium carbonate. The first focus relies on hindering the fluid flow by swelling of superabsorbent polymers after they <b>are</b> exposed <b>to</b> a humid environment. The sealing capacity was measured by means of water permeability tests and through visualization of permeability tests by neutron radiography. Superabsorbent polymers <b>are</b> able <b>to</b> seal cracks and thus allow a recovery in water-tightness as a decrease in permeability is noticed. The second focus relies on healing of small cracks in fibre reinforced cementitious materials, restoring the mechanical properties. The regain in mechanical properties was analyzed by four-point-bending tests and the crack closure was microscopically monitored. Cracks close through the combination of further hydration of unhydrated cement particles, precipitation of calcium carbonate and activation of the pozzolanic reaction of fly ash. Desorption of superabsorbent polymers triggers healing in the vicinity of crack faces and <b>cracks</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 130 μm <b>were</b> able <b>to</b> close completely in wet/dry cycles due to the precipitation of calcium carbonate. Mortar samples containing superabsorbent polymers even showed partial healing when stored under a relative humidity of more than 60 %. In this way, a smart cementitious material which is reliable and independent from the conditions is acquired...|$|R

60|$|I am {{bound to}} admit also that tiger-hunting {{is not quite}} all it is <b>cracked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> In my fancy I had pictured the gallant and bloodthirsty beast rushing out upon us full pelt from some grass-grown nullah at the first sniff of our presence, and {{fiercely}} attacking both men and elephants. Instead of that, I will confess the whole truth: frightened as {{at least one of}} us was of the tiger, the tiger was still more desperately frightened of his human assailants. I could see clearly that, so far from rushing out of his own accord to attack us, his one desire was to be let alone. He was horribly afraid; he skulked in the jungle like a wary old fox in a trusty spinney. There was no nullah (whatever a nullah may be), there was only a waste of dusty cane-brake. We encircled the tall grass patch where he lurked, forming a big round with a ring-fence of elephants. The beaters on foot, advancing, half naked, with a caution with which I could fully sympathise, endeavoured by loud shouts and gesticulations to rouse the royal beast to a sense of his position. Not a bit of it: the royal beast declined to be drawn; he preferred retirement. The Maharajah, whose elephant was stationed next to mine, even apologised for the resolute cowardice with which he clung to his ignoble lurking-place.|$|E

60|$|For {{the first}} {{two or three years}} the young palms must be well watered, and the soil around them opened; after which the tall graceful stem begins to rise rapidly into the open air. In this {{condition}} it may be literally said to make the tropics--those fallacious tropics, I mean, of painters and poets, of Enoch Arden and of Locksley Hall. You may observe that whenever an artist wants to make a tropical picture, he puts a group of coco-nut palms in the foreground, as much as to say, 'You see there's no deception; these are the genuine unadulterated tropics.' But as to painting the tropics without the palms, he might just as well think of painting the desert without the camels. At eight or ten years old the tree flowers, bearing blossoms of the ordinary palm type, degraded likenesses of the lilies and yuccas, greenish and inconspicuous, but visited by insects for the sake of their pollen. The flower, however, is fertilised by the wind, which carries the pollen grains from one bunch of blossoms to another. Then the nuts gradually swell out to an enormous size, and ripen very slowly, even under the brilliant tropical sun. (I will admit that the tropics are hot, though in other respects I hold them to be arrant impostors, like that precocious American youth who announced on his tenth birthday that in his opinion life wasn't all that it was <b>cracked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.)</b> But the worst thing about the coco-nut palm, the missionaries always say, is the fatal fact that, when once fairly started, it goes on bearing fruit uninterruptedly for forty years. This is very immoral and wrong of the ill-conditioned tree, because it encourages the idyllic Polynesian to lie under the palms, all day long, cooling his limbs in the sea occasionally, sporting with Amaryllis in the shade, or with the tangles of Neæra's hair, and waiting for the nuts to drop down in due time, when he ought (according to European notions) to be killing himself with hard work under a blazing sky, raising cotton, sugar, indigo, and coffee, for the immediate benefit of the white merchant, and the ultimate advantage of the British public. It doesn't enforce habits of steady industry and perseverance, the good missionaries say; it doesn't induce the native to feel that burning desire for Manchester piece-goods and the other blessings of civilisation which ought properly to accompany the propagation of the missionary in foreign parts. You stick your nut in the sand; you sit by a few years and watch it growing; you pick up the ripe fruits as they fall from the tree; and you sell them at last for illimitable red cloth to the Manchester piece-goods merchant. Nothing could be more simple or more satisfactory. And yet {{it is difficult to see}} the precise moral distinction between the owner of a coco-nut grove in the South Sea Islands and the owner of a coal-mine or a big estate in commercial England. Each lounges decorously through life after his own fashion; only the one lounges in a Russia leather chair at a club in Pall Mall, while the other lounges in a nice soft dust-heap beside a rolling surf in Tahiti or the Hawaiian Archipelago.|$|E
