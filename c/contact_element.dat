40|$|This {{publication}} {{describes the}} development, production and characterization of microspring <b>contact</b> <b>elements</b> for temporary and permanent assembly of microsystem components. Those elements provide a microsystem with the possibily of testing each single component prior to permanent assembly. After providing each contact {{of the single}} components with a studbump the component is fip-chiped {{on top of the}} microsprings. The electrical contact is then achieved by applying a sufficient contact force. Mechanical tolerances can be equalized by the microsprings. If required, the temporary contacts can be converted to permanent contacts by a reflow process or by applying an adhesive. The challenge of this work is to demonstrate the ability of the <b>contact</b> <b>elements</b> to be used at a frequency range up to several GHz. To meet the requirements of modern semiconductor devices the <b>contact</b> <b>elements</b> were miniaturized as much as possible. To perform the characterization an optimal test platform was developed on the basis of companar waveguides (CPW). Additional optimization strategies were presented. To achieve an optimal design the microsprings were simulated mechanically (ANSYS) and electrically (Ansoft HFSS). The mechanical simulations were performed to achieve a sufficient contact force without plstical deformation of the construction. To maximize the high frequency range electrial simulations were performed. As a result of the simulations the microsprings were designed spiral symmetric with three cantilevers. The outer diameter was set to 250 µm. The 3 D-microsprings were produced by using LIGA-processes. The possible aspect-ratios (height:width) of the processes, in particular of the lithographic processes have been the limits of the construction. The mechanical characterization of the microsprings was performed by the use of a needle prober. To characterize the electrical performance, scattering parameters and TDR/TDT-measurements have been performed. A usability of the <b>contact</b> <b>elements</b> for frequencies up to 8. 5 GHz could be demonstrated.

40|$|To predict {{crack opening}} stresses, <b>contact</b> <b>elements</b> are {{incorporated}} into the elastic-plastic finite element analysis of fatigue crack closure. A code using ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL) is developed. In {{spite of the fact}} that the use of <b>contact</b> <b>elements</b> in modelling crack surface contact and crack closure is inherently natural, efforts to incorporate them in the finite element analysis of crack closure are not widespread. The traditional method of modelling crack closure is based on placing truss elements at the crack surface nodes. In the present research, <b>contact</b> <b>elements</b> are used to model crack surface contact. While the load is applied incrementally, crack opening stress is determined by monitoring the state of the <b>contact</b> <b>elements.</b> The results of two-dimensional plane strain finite element analyses are in good agreement with previous work reported in the literature. Instead of finding crack opening stress at every load cycle, an algorithm to find crack opening stress at predetermined load cycle intervals is developed. With the developed algorithm it was possible to analyze crack closure behaviour during a larger number of load cycles with less execution time. The algorithm that is implemented is parametrically analysed. The effect of load increment is investigated. Since crack opening stress is not evaluated at every cycle, the effect of how often opening stresses are determined is another issue that is investigated. As a result of the simulation with a relatively high number of cycles, it was possible to observe the final stabilization in the crack opening stress values that follows a decay after the initial plateau...|$|R
