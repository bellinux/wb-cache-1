The {{majority of}} the monochalcogenides are conducting, indicating a formulation LnIIIQ2−(e-) where the electron is in conduction bands.

25|$|The {{negative}} feedback into the difference amplifier allows the amplifier {{to compare the}} input to the actual output. The amplified signal from Q1 is directly fed to the second stage, Q3, which is a common emitter stage that provides further amplification of the signal and the DC bias for the output stages, Q4 and Q5. R6 provides the load for Q3 (a better design would probably use some form of active load here, such as a constant-current sink). So far, all of the amplifier is operating in class A. The output pair are arranged in class-AB push–pull, also called a complementary pair. They provide {{the majority of the}} current amplification (while consuming low quiescent current) and directly drive the load, connected via DC-blocking capacitor C2. The diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the <b>conducting</b> <b>state</b> so that crossover distortion is minimized. That is, the diodes push the output stage firmly into class-AB mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation).|$|E
2500|$|On December 2, it was {{announced}} that Harper's plan was to ask the Governor General to prorogue parliament, delaying a confidence vote until the new year. The coalition leadership sent a letter to Jean—who, at the time, was abroad <b>conducting</b> <b>state</b> visits to various European countries—informing her of the events, upon the receipt of which, Jean announced that she would cut her trip short and return to Ottawa [...] "in light of the current political situation in Canada." [...] Harper visited the Governor General at Rideau Hall, at approximately 9:30 am ET, on December 4. After consulting with the Prime Minister and other advisors for more than two hours, Jean granted Harper's request and parliament was prorogued until January 26, 2009, with the Conservatives scheduled to announce the budget the following day. Near the end of her tenure as vicereine, Jean revealed to the Canadian Press that the two-hour delay in giving her decision was partly to [...] "send a message—and for people to understand that this warranted reflection." [...] She later stated in an interview on The Hour that [...] "I was in a position where I could have said no... And the decision had really to, in my mind, to be in the best interests, really, of the country, looking at all of the circumstances. And I have no regrets." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} ion {{transport}} through a locust potassium channel {{is described by}} means of the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). The deterministic and stochastic components of the process of switching between various <b>conducting</b> <b>states</b> of the channel are expressed by two coefficients, $D^{(1) }$ and $D^{(2) }$, a drift and a diffusion coefficient, respectively. The FPE leads to a Langevin equation. This analysis reveals beside the well known deterministic aspects a turbulent, cascade type of action. The (noisy-like) switching between different <b>conducting</b> <b>states</b> prevents the channel from staying in one, closed or open state. The similarity between the hydrodynamic flow in the turbulent regime and hierarchical switching between <b>conducting</b> <b>states</b> of this biochannel is discussed. A non-trivial character of $D^{(1) }$ and $D^{(2) }$ coefficients is shown, which points to different processes governing the channel's action, asymetrically depending {{on the history of the}} previously <b>conducting</b> <b>states.</b> Moreover, the Fokker-Planck and Langevin equations provide information on whether and how the statistics of the channel action change over various time scales.

The cause {{which has}} now been {{assigned}} for the rotation in Arago's experiment, namely, the production of electrical currents, seems abundantly sufficient in all cases where the metals, or perhaps even other conductors, are concerned; but with regard to such bodies as glass, resins, and, above all, gases, it seems impossible that currents of electricity, capable of producing these effects, should be generated in them. Yet Arago found that the effects in question were produced by these and by all bodies tried (81.). Messrs.
