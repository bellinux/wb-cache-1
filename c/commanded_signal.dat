A 26. 5 -Hz canard pitch-mode response was aliased by the digital sampling rate in the canard-position feed-back loop of the flight-control system, resulting in a 13. 5 -Hz signal being commanded to the longitudinal control surfaces. The amplitude of this <b>commanded</b> <b>signal</b> increased as the wear of the canard seals increased, as the feedback path gains were increased, and as the canard aerodynamic loading decreased.

The thereby deflected nozzle flapper system produces a pressure difference across the drive areas of the spool and affects its movement. The position transducer (LVDT) which is excited via an oscillator measures the position of the spool (actual value, position voltage). This signal is then demodulated and fed back to the controller where it is compared with the <b>command</b> <b>signal.</b> The controller drives the pilot stage until the error between <b>command</b> <b>signal</b> and feedback signal will be zero.

40|$|The {{closed-loop}} dynamic {{behavior of}} post-buckled precompressed (PBP) piezoelectric elements is in-vestigated in this paper. PBP actuators {{have been shown}} to be capable of generating significantly larger deflections than traditional piezoelectric actuators, up to a factor of three, without compromising applied end force. Due to an axial force close to the perfect-column buckling load they have displayed reduced stability and even instability around zero deflection. Therefore, a closed-loop control system was created to stabilize the PBP actuator over its entire range of deflections. The dynamic response of this system was compared with the open-loop response of the PBP actuator and with the dynamic characteristics of a traditional elec-tromechanical servoactuator. It was found that a pure integrative (I) controller was able to stabilize the PBP actuator over its entire range of deflections. To maintain stability, the gains had to be decreased for higher axial loads, reducing the bandwidth of the system, but still outperforming a traditional servoactuator by 40 %. Furthermore, the influence of actuating an aerodynamic control surface was investigated by adding an inertial mass to one of the supporting axes of the PBP actuator. It was shown that a PBP actuator was capable of rotating these masses, although this slightly reduced the speed of the response.

40|$|Large servo-hydraulic {{shaking table}} systems are {{essential}} tools in experimental earthquake engineering. They provide {{effective ways to}} subject structural components, substructures, or entire structural systems to dynamic excitations similar to those induced by real earthquakes. A typical shake table system includes mechanical, hydraulic, and electronic components. The main objective {{of this study is}} to develop a comprehensive mechanics- based virtual model for the large NEES-UCSD shake table under bare and loaded table conditions. The shake table model developed in this study includes a virtual replica of the actual controller, four servovalve models, two single-ended actuators, two effective accumulators, a two- dimensional mechanical subsystem model, and linear/ nonlinear specimens modelled using the finite element analysis framework OpenSees. OpenSees is integrated to the rest of the simulation model in Matlab-Simulink® using a client-server technique developed within this work. Test- simulation correlation studies show that the virtual system model developed is capable of reproducing the nonlinear dynamic response behaviour of the NEES-UCSD shake table. An extensive set of shake table tests using harmonic and earthquake acceleration records as reference/ commanded signals were performed on the NEES-UCSD table to assess its signal reproduction fidelity after tuning the table controller and using an iterative time-history matching technique. These tests were designed to quantify the effects of the amplitude of the signal used for tuning the table on the signal reproduction fidelity. It was found that the level of fidelity in signal reproduction achieved for a specific amplitude of the <b>commanded</b> <b>signal</b> under the corresponding optimum tuning of the table cannot be maintained when reproducing the same signal at different amplitudes. This is a clear indication that shake tables are highly nonlinear systems and the current state-of-the-art controller and tuning techniques fall short of compensating accurately for these inherent system nonlinearities. The mechanics-based virtual system model developed is extremely useful for: (i) understanding the underlying coupled nonlinear dynamics of a large shake table system; (ii) investigating the most significant sources of signal distortion; (iii) offline tuning of the actual table either by using only the virtual replica of the existing controller or by combining it with simulation -based iterative time history matching techniques; (iv) investigating shake table - linear/nonlinear specimen interaction problem; and (v) future more advanced control algorithm development...|$|E

40|$|UAVs {{employed}} for low altitude jobs are more liable {{to collide with}} the urban structures {{on their way to}} the goal point. In this thesis, the problem of reactive obstacle avoidance is addressed by an innovative partial integrated guidance and control (PIGC) approach using the Six-DOF model of real UAV unlike the kinematic models used in the existing literatures. The guidance algorithm is designed which uses the collision cone approach to predict any possible collision with the obstacle and computes an alternate aiming direction for the vehicle. The aiming direction of the vehicle is the line of sight line tangent to the safety ball surrounding the obstacle. The point where the tangent touches the safety ball is the aiming point. Once the aiming point is known, the obstacle is avoided by directing the vehicle (on the principles of pursuit guidance) along the tangent to the safety ball. First, the guidance algorithm is applied successfully to the point mass model of UAV to verify the proposed collision avoidance concept. Next, PIGC approach is proposed for reactive obstacle avoidance of UAVs. The reactive nature of the avoidance problem within the available time window demands simultaneous reaction from the guidance and control loop structures of the system i. e, in the IGC framework (executes in single loop). However, such quick maneuvers cause the faster dynamics of the system to go unstable due to inherent separation between the faster and slower dynamics. On the contrary, in the conventional design (executes in three loops), the settling time of the response of different loops will not be able to match with the stringent time-to-go window for obstacle avoidance. This causes delay in tracking in all the loops which will affect the system performance adversely and hence UAV will fail to avoid the obstacle. However, in the PIGC framework, it overcomes the disadvantage of both the IGC design and the conventional design, by introducing one more loop compared to the IGC approach and reducing a loop compared to the conventional approach, hence named as Partial IGC. Nonlinear dynamic inversion technique based PIGC approach utilizes the faster and slower dynamics of the full nonlinear Six-DOF model of UAV and executes the avoidance maneuver in two loops. In the outer loop, the vehicle guidance strategy attempts to reorient the velocity vector of the vehicle along the aiming point within a fraction of the available time-to-go. The orientation of the velocity vector is achieved by enforcing the angular correction in the horizontal and vertical flight path angles and enforcing turn coordination. The outer loop generates the body angular rates which are tracked as the <b>commanded</b> <b>signal</b> in the inner loop. The enforcement of the desired body rates generates the necessary control surface deflections required to stir the UAV. Control surface deflections are realized by the vehicle through the first order actuator dynamics. A controller for the first order actuator model is also proposed in order to reduce the actuator delay. Every loop of the PIGC technique uses nonlinear dynamic inversion technique which has critical issues like sensitiveness to the modeling inaccuracies of the plant model. To make it robust against the parameter inaccuracies of the system, it is reinforced with the neuro-adaptive design in the inner loop of the PIGC design. In the NA design, weight update rule based on Lyapunov’s theory provides online training of the weights. To enhance fast and stable training of the weights, preflight maneuvers are proposed. Preflight maneuvers provide stabilized pre-trained weights which prevents any misapprehensions in the obstacle avoidance scenario. Simulation studies have been carried out with the point mass model and with the Six-DOF model of the real fixed wing UAV in the PIGC framework to test the performance of the nonlinear reactive guidance scheme. Various simulations have been executed with different number and size of the obstacles. NA augmented PIGC design is validated with different levels of uncertainties in the plant model. A comparative study in NA augmented PIGC design was performed between the pre-trained weights and zero weights as used for weight initialization in online training. Various comparative study shows that the NA augmented PIGC design is quite effective in avoiding collisions in different scenarios. Since the NDI technique involved in the PIGC design gives a closed loop solution and does not operate with iterative steps, therefore the reactive obstacle avoidance is achieved in a computationally efficient manner...|$|E

40|$|A signal {{processing}} technique {{has been developed}} to dramatically increase both the usable bandwidth and tracking accuracy of an actuator. Traditional feedback controller design makes little or no use of the information content of the driving <b>command</b> <b>signal.</b> Feedforward and look-ahead schemes use a small sliding window of trajectory data to improve tracking performance and to reduce the overshoot of an accelerated axis. If the entire <b>command</b> <b>signal</b> for each axis of a machine is generated off-line, and the dynamic response of each axis is well characterized, then a new <b>command</b> <b>signal</b> can be derived which will drive the axes to follow the correct motion path. This idea is related to reference feedforward control, but by considering the complete <b>command</b> <b>signal</b> a priori, performance of the overall machine tool is greatly enhanced. An inverse dynamics algorithm has been developed that modifies a motion path using an actuator's impulse response to produce a new <b>command</b> <b>signal</b> that counteracts actuator dynamics, yielding {{a significant reduction in}} steady-state tracking error. This technique critically depends on knowledge of the actuator dynamics and does not replace the feedback controller. Rather it improves the response of an actuator by compensating for high frequency dynamics that the servo feedback loop cannot correct due to saturation of the drive system.
