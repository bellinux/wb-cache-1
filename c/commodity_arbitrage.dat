40|$|In spite ofthe {{empirical}} failure ofthe "Law of One Price, " it {{is usually}} assumed that commodity prices are perfectly arbitraged, {{at least in the}} long run. This paper argues that this assumption is counterfactual and that much of the empirical evidence provided to support it is flawed and affected by econometric shortcomings (spurious regressions, nonstationarity in the data, inappropriate use of first differences). An alternative methodology (co-integration), by which a long-run relationship between nonstationary series can be tested, is proposed. Tests of nonstationarity and co-integration for a group of commodities show quite uniformly that the "Law of One Price, " as a long-run relationship, fails, and that deviations from the pattern are permanent. Key words: co-integration tests, commodity prices, law of one price, spurious regressions. unit-root tests. According to several models of exchange rate determination, commodity price arbitrage, at least for some goods, is a necessary condition to determine the level of the exchange rates. It guarantees that prices are internationally equalized, which is a condition for purchasing power parities to hold. Under some additional assumptions, like fixed exchange rates, per-fect <b>commodity</b> <b>arbitrage</b> implies international transmission of inflation (an increase in one price in domestic currency units is reflected in its counterpart in foreign currency units) and instantaneous effects on nominal prices of ex-change rate adjustments. On the other side, a transitory absence of commodity price arbi-trage can contribute to explaining short-run volatility of exchange rates and "overshoot-ing " effects. Following the usual definition, <b>commodity</b> <b>arbitrage</b> ensures that each good has a single price (defined in a common cur-rency unit) throughout the world (Isard). This has been called the "Law of One Price" (LOP). Empirical studies on international prices frequently find significant and persistent de-viations from equilibrium values either at th...|$|E

The difficulty of <b>commodity</b> <b>arbitrage</b> across international borders SSA is however a fundamental constraint to price transmission, market integration and the realisation of the welfare enhancing role of cross-border trade in Africa. This study examines the impact of border and distance on price transmission between tomato markets in Ghana and Burkina-Faso. Theanalysis applies a regime-switching vector error correction model to estimate semi-weekly, wholesale prices of tomato in four tomato markets in Ghana and a production centre in Burkina-Faso. Estimated parameters of price transmission contain evidence of border and distance effects. This is expected since high transfer costs, including cross-border tariffs are incurred by traders in moving tomato across the border. Moreover, the perishable nature of tomato, and the poor quality of roads and transportation facilities may imply additional costs of risks to arbitrageurs. The findings have both theoretical relevance and practical implications for facilitating cross-border trade in West Africa, especially for trade between landlocked countries like Burkina-Faso and coastal ones like Ghana.

Nonetheless, promoting trade liberalization before other interventions may still make sense when ATBs are present because reduced trade uncertainty also improves world welfare. Key words: agricultural trade, margins, nontariff trade barriers, uncertainty. Marketing firms seek profits from <b>commodity</b> <b>arbitrage</b> by exploiting the margin, or differ-ence, between the exporter price and the im-porter price. Competitive marketing firms sometimes cause price alignment between countries by increasing shipments under free trade (Samuelson, Takayama and Judge). But several factors may preclude price alignment in agricultural markets. For instance, trade policies such as quotas or variable levies limit price adjustment in importing countries (McCalla). Also, local supply and demand conditions may sometimes be a barrier to trade (Sexton, Kling, and Carman). Third, oli-gopoly pricing occasionally restricts price equalization (Ohno and Gallagher). Uncertainty may also complicate marketing firm behavior and margins for internation-ally traded agricultural products. Some di-mensions of marketing firm uncertainty have been studied (Goodwin, Grennes, and Wohlgenant; Hennessy; Fraser). But trade (volume) uncertainty, which exists when ac-cess to the import market is not assured, has received less attention. Paul Gallagher {{is associate professor of}} agricultural economic...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the determination of}} the exchange rate system in a small economy when external real and monetary disturbances occur. Choice of exchange rate policy is investigated using a model assuming rational expectations and a loss function expressing the squared deviations of the small country output from desired output. The distinguishing feature of the analysis is the emphasis on real as well as monetary disturbances which originate abroad but are a source of domestic output variation. the link between foreign monetary and real disturbances and variance in output is traced using the thoretical model and the loss function assumed. The emphasis of the analysis is on a three country (one small and two large) trading situation, whereby the small country trades with two major large country trading partners. It is assumed throughout that there is perfect <b>commodity</b> <b>arbitrage</b> between two large countries. The small country imports an intermediate good from one of the large countries and exports a finished good. The small country doesnot import goods for consumption. there is perfect capital movement between two large countries, but capital is immobile between the small and these two large countries. The analysis indicates that occurrence of purely nominal shocks abroad are not transmitted to the small country under floating exchange rate system. The presence of real disturbances in large countries induce lower prices for the goods they produce, but the effect on the exchange rate is ambiguos. This study concludes that in general the adoption of a flexible exchange rate system by a small country is preferred and results in lower loss in most cases of external disturbance...|$|E
40|$|This thesis brings {{together}} {{a collection of}} essays on parity conditions in international economics: covered interest parity: covered interest parity: purchasing power parity and real interest parity. While each essay is an independent study of a particular problem area, there exists a common theme in that the set of parity conditions chosen for analysis is thought to be important in determining the short and long-nm behaviour of exchange rates. The justification for the study arises from two related issues. Firstly, as it is often assumed that exchange rates are determined in efficient markets, an analysis of international parity conditions may help us comment on the efficient markets hypothesis. We define efficiency according to Fama (1970), Where the market is said to be efficient if prices 'fully reflect' all currently available information. Secondly, models of exchange rate determination, within which the above parity conditions play a fundamental role, have exhibited a poor empirical performance in the recent past. An examination of the foundations of such models may therefore be helpful in allocating 'blame'. Of the four problem areas analysed ally covered interest parity was unconditionally accepted as a plausible assumption. Fran a possible 6330 potential arbitrage opportunities observed during the months of August and September 1987, only eight would have been profitable. Agents were efficient in terms of ensuring the forward exchange premium equalled the relevant interest rate differentials, subject to transaction costs. Some evidence however was found for the existence of a risk premium in the forward exchange rate during the 1920 s, but attempts to model the premium as both a function of past forecast errors and as a latent variable, had limited success. We were therefore unable to verify the existence of risk averse speculative agents in foreign exchange markets. Purchasing power parity, analysed in terms of a theory of arbitrage for the period 1975 to 1980, using a recently developed econometric technique - cointegration - was rejected. This would imply that <b>commodity</b> <b>arbitrage</b> may be inefficient. A direct test of real interest parity using the bivariate vector autoregression approach, was also decisively rejected for the period 1979 to 1986. The observation that real interest rates do not fully reflect all currently held information suggests that the long term credibility of the European Monetary System may be suspect and that governments can influence national investment/saving decisions by intervention in domestic financial markets...|$|E
