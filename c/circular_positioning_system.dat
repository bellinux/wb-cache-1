40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Accuracy {{requirements}} for positioning a vessel {{in the near}} shore area have increased in recent years. To meet these requirements several electronic positioning systems have been developed. One such system is the Cubic Autotape Model DM- 40. The Autotape is a <b>circular</b> <b>positioning</b> <b>system</b> which utilizes the phase comparison between transmitted and received microwave signals to measure the respective distance {{to the ends of}} a known base line. Since line of sight transmission is used, the accuracy is higher than many other systems, but the useable range is limited to approximately 30 miles. To evaluate the instrument under dynamic conditions, a second order trilateration control network was established and adjusted using least squares techniques. Autotape measurements were then recorded together with a measure of the velocity of the interrogator antenna as the instrument moved past a series of seven test stations. The relationship between the velocity and the observation errors was then investigated. The instrument was used to measure known base lines and the positions of the test stations under static conditions. The static measurements were tested {{to determine the effects of}} classification by day and mode using a three factor analysis of variance program. Test station coordinates were computed from the static measurements and compared to control values. Scale factors were also computed from these measurements. The dynamic observations were scaled and the relationship between the scaled observation errors and the velocity was also investigated. Although contrary to expectations, the dynamic measurement errors tend to decrease as the velocity increases. A possible explanation involves the filtering of the received signal. Coordinates were also computed from the dynamic measurements and were found to exhibit the same general trend as the range measurements. Final results indicate that for the conditions of this project the relative error of position for the repeatability of the instrument is one part in 3330 and the relative error of the survey is one part in 2610...|$|E
40|$|The {{practical}} {{deployment of}} wireless <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> requires minimizing the calibration procedures while improving the location estimation accuracy. Received Signal Strength localization techniques using propagation channel models are the simplest alternative, {{but they are}} usually designed {{under the assumption that}} the radio propagation model is to be perfectly characterized a priori. In practice, this assumption does not hold and the localization results are affected by the inaccuracies of the theoretical, roughly calibrated or just imperfect channel models used to compute location. In this paper, we propose the use of weighted multilateration techniques to gain robustness with respect to these inaccuracies, reducing the dependency of having an optimal channel model. In particular, we propose two weighted least squares techniques based on the standard hyperbolic and <b>circular</b> <b>positioning</b> algorithms that specifically consider the accuracies of the different measurements to obtain a better estimation of the position. These techniques are compared to the standard hyperbolic and <b>circular</b> <b>positioning</b> techniques through both numerical simulations and an exhaustive set of real experiments on different types of wireless networks (a wireless sensor network, a WiFi network and a Bluetooth network). The algorithms not only produce better localization results with a very limited overhead in terms of computational cost but also achieve a greater robustness to inaccuracies in channel modeling...|$|R

A Global <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> module is able to accurately determine position without sensor drift, but its usage is limited in heavily urbanized environments and heavy vegetation. While high-cost tactical-grade Inertial Navigation <b>System</b> can determine <b>position</b> accurately, low-cost micro-electro-mechanical system Inertial Navigation System sensors are plagued by significant errors. Global <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> is coupled with Inertial Navigation System to correct the errors, while Inertial Navigation System itself {{can be used to}} provide navigation solution during a Global <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> outage. Data from Global <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> and Inertial Navigation System can be integrated by extensive Kalman filtering, using loosely coupled integration architecture to provide navigation solutions. In this study, real-time low-cost loosely coupled micro-electro-mechanical system Inertial Navigation System/Global <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> sensors have been used for pedestrian navigation.
