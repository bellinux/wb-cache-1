50|$|The {{road was}} built as {{initiative}} from the Crosslinks Further Study, which highlighted {{the need for}} another vehicular <b>cross-border</b> <b>link</b> between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. At {{the date of the}} study (2001), there were three existing vehicular border crossings, located at Lok Ma Chau, Man Kam To and Sha Tau Kok. At that time, these links were nearing saturation and were expected to reach their maximum handling capacity by 2006. As a result, the government of Hong Kong proposed the Shenzhen Western Corridor and Deep Bay Link as an additional vehicular border crossing to provide additional cross-border road infrastructure.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, it was {{announced}} that Sella Nevea will receive substantial funds to replace outdated ski equipment, and that a cableway will be built that will connect it to the neighbouring Goriška municipality of Bovec, one of the largest winter ski resorts in Slovenia. The <b>cross-border</b> <b>link</b> of the two resorts was completed in December 2009. It is now possible to ski at both resorts. Because both Italy and Slovenia are members of the European Schengen zone, skiers are able to cross the border between Italy and Slovenia freely, effectively merging the Sella Nevea and Bovec ski resorts into one large ski resort covering both sides of the Kanin mountain.|$|E
40|$|Interconnection between France and Italy {{under the}} Alps could impact the European power system stability. Indeed, the HVDC lines are active {{elements}} of electrical grid that influence its dynamic behaviour {{in case of}} disturbances. Extensive studies must be run to precisely determine the specifications of this <b>cross-border</b> <b>link</b> and its conversion stations. These studies require models as precise as possible of the European network. The best available model at present for the synchronous network of continental Europe is the Dynamic Reference Model (DRM), which was compiled {{in the framework of}} the IPS/UPS study [6]. It modelled a winter situation (high peak load) and the first task of the Master Thesis consisted {{in the development of a}} summer situation (low load period) of this model. In this way, it would be possible to perform stability studies in both situations to obtain more precise and reliable results. The DRM models for winter summer situation were firstly designed to study small-signal stability and especially inter-area mode, i. e. electromechanical oscillations between two groups of machines. In the perspective of transient stability studies in the area of the future HVDC line between France and Italy, this model had to be updated. Detailed versions of regulators and transformers were therefore implemented in order to model more precisely the transient dynamic behaviour of French machines. An update of the dynamic data of the Italian power system had also to be performed with new detailed versions of regulators created. Furthermore, the European synchronous electric power system is becoming larger with interconnections of new countries, such as Turkey in 2011 and other ones in the future. Because of this on-going enlargement, new phenomena concerning inter-area modes might occur. In this new context, benchmarks had been created to develop and test a new methodology for tuning the regulators’ parameters of synchronous generators...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe strong {{differentials}} on {{both sides}} of the Belgian-Luxembourger border, both in terms of salaries and housing prices, have stimulated for more than two decades the <b>cross-border</b> <b>links</b> between the two countries. Thus, whereas in 2008 nearly 40, 000 residents of Belgium crossed the border each day to work in the Grand Duchy, between 2001 and 2007, more than 2, 600 residents of Luxembourg went to live in Belgium, though they remained employed in Luxembourg.

50|$|The Dutch {{network has}} several {{cross-border}} sections to Belgium and Germany. Of these, Terneuzen {{is linked to}} Belgium (freight-only), {{but not to the}} rest of the Dutch network. Contrarily, Lanaken (B) is connected to Maastricht (also freight only) but not to the Belgian network. Six <b>cross-border</b> <b>links</b> are electrified. Due to the difference in voltage, trains must change monovoltage locomotives at Bad Bentheim or Venlo; monovoltage Belgian 3 kV trains reach Roosendaal and Maastricht with reduced power. The HSL Zuid has no voltage change at the border itself. Alternatively, multi-system train units or diesel traction is used. Several border crossings are disused or freight-only. There are no breaks of gauge at any of the crossings.|$|R
50|$|Few of {{the older}} Uyghur {{migrants}} retain personal <b>cross-border</b> <b>links</b> with relatives or friends in Xinjiang. Those who do generally try to avoid drawing Kazakhstani government attention to these links; for example, when their relatives from Xinjiang come to visit, they obtain visas on the pretext of being cross-border traders. During perestroika and glasnost in the 1980s, the Kazakh SSR government encouraged Uyghurs to discuss and promote Xinjiang independence in a successful strategy to eradicate a popular movement for Uyghur autonomy within the Soviet Union. By 1990, the Uyghurs' shifting ethnic and political (anti-China) consciousness led them to build separate mosques and schools from the Dungan people ("Chinese Muslims"), with whom they had lived together in Kazakhstan since the 1950s.|$|R

40|$|Based on {{existing}} {{research in the}} interface of emissions trading schemes (ETSs) and WTO law, the paper looks {{more closely at the}} design elements of an ETS that are most vulnerable to a WTO challenge, including border adjustment on importation and exportation, recycling of revenues and <b>cross-border</b> <b>linking.</b> The analysis of WTO consistency of various ETS regulatory components reveals significant legal uncertainty. One explanation is that an ETS is not yet fully established as a regulatory tool. It does not have a fixed design and its design elements vary significantly with a scheme. Moreover, ETS-related issues have never been raised in WTO disputes. This makes it hard to predict with confidence the outcome of scrutiny of an ETS by a WTO adjudicative body. In this respect, the availability of environmental and/or health exceptions for justification of ETS-related measures is of great importance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a financial network, designated the "Macro-Network", that depicts {{the connections between}} the main financial and non-financial {{sectors of the economy}} in the various financial instruments of the euro area. The Macro-Network comprises of linkages across financial and non-financial Sectors in each country. These country-level sector networks are then connected by the <b>cross-border</b> <b>links</b> between the individual banking sectors. Using the Macro-Network to simulate financial shocks, we find that the propagation effects depend on the underlying network structure, which evolves overtime. After the financial crisis, bilateral linkages contracted sharply, reflecting the surge in counterparty risk and the de-leveraging processes. Nonetheless, our analysis suggests that even after this process, vulnerabilities remained in the euro area financial system, while a more diversified portfolio of cross-border exposures might mitigate the shock effects. We identify sectors which are most relevant for the propagation of financial shocks in the Macro-Network...|$|R
40|$|A {{forensic}} intelligence process was conducted over cross-border seizures of false identity documents whose sources were partly {{known to be}} the same.

40|$|Published online: 2010 An {{increasing}} number of authors describe the European Union as an advanced form of transgovernmentalism. Whether called Europeanization, supranational intergovernmentalism, multilevel governance, administrative fusion or Brusselisation, the transgovernmentalist thesis states that European politics is shaped by the growing interaction of national government officials {{at every level of}} the decision-making process.

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{cross-border}} effects of patent box regimes that reduce {{the tax rate}} on income from intellectual property. We argue that the tax cut in one location of a multinational enterprise may reduce the user cost of capital for the whole group if profit shifting is possible. This spillover effect of the foreign tax cut raises domestic R&D investment. We test this mechanism by combining information on patents, firm ownership and specific characteristics of patent box regimes. Empirical results from a micro-level analysis suggest that patent box regimes without a nexus requirement (patent havens) induce positive cross-border externalities on R&D activity within multinational groups. For firms with <b>cross-border</b> <b>links,</b> {{the implementation of a}} foreign patent haven increases domestic research activity by about 2. 3 % per implied tax rate differential. Furthermore, our findings suggest that patent boxes generate negative spillovers on average patent quality. This has important implications for international tax policy and the evaluation of patent box regimes...|$|R
