40|$|Abstract. Dealing with {{biological}} {{topics in}} school {{can be challenging}} for both teachers and students despite a direct connection to their daily lives and existing pre-knowledge. This applies to carbohydrates, {{which can be treated}} in biology with regard to health education, making it possible to combine the <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> with the practical example of sugars and sweeteners. Carbohydrates are required for energy production by both animals and plants. Their general molecular construction, however, is similar. Sugars are also carbohydrates with the most important simple ones being Glucose and Fructose (monosaccharides). Due to their natural sweetness there are used in foods, but since obesity and diabetes have increased dramatically in the western countries, the discovery of synthetic sweeteners was a great success. When developing synthetic sweeteners, factors such as toxicity, stability and cost aside from taste have to be considered. This article aims at giving necessary, yet simple background knowledge needed for holding a thorough lesson or even teaching unit on the topic of carbohydrates as exemplified by sugars. It is rounded off by suggestions how to conduct the teaching with concrete experiments, for each of which a worksheet is provided at the end...|$|E
40|$|Much of our {{research}} has been concerned with devis-ing techniques for the representation, <b>conveyance</b> and acquisition <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> as we have sought solutions to problems of"learnability. " To develop a general learning theory we have examined the notion of correct informa-tion, or behavior, within a knowledge domain- as distin-guished from that behavior which is incorrect. We have also investigated the means to represent these knowledge classes perfectly. In most problems we have considered, a knowledge domain is (potentially) infinite, so no realistic learning process would {{have access to a}} complete set of behav-ioral data. The successful solution to a learning problem thus might depend on the representation and <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> infinite <b>knowledge</b> (possibly correct and incorrect be...|$|R
40|$|Abstract|Music {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{sophisticated}} as well as one of the most popular arts. Everyone wants to hear new good music. However, the productivity of composing pieces of music is limited. Moreover, people want to enjoy not only listening to but also performing music. However, many diÆculties prevent people from actually performing music. We have been working on technologies that enhance human musical creativity. This paper discusses how com-puter can and should facilitate the creative processes in-volved in performing music. We describe three attempts made toward this aim: supporting musical divergent think-ing, supporting <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> musical <b>knowledge,</b> and sup-porting non-creative musical processes. Based on our expe-riences in making these attempts, we discuss how and where computers can contribute to the musical creation process...|$|R
40|$|Practical (laboratory) work {{in science}} {{education}} {{has traditionally been}} used to allow students to rediscover already known concepts and ideas, to demonstrate concepts taught in the classroom or, {{in the case of}} inquirybased science curricula, to teach concepts. Often, these laboratory practicals do not achieve their goals and may even confuse or demotivate students. It is not that using ‘wet’ practicals is intrinsically wrong; rather, it is that they are often used for the wrong reasons. They do have a place in science curricula - for the <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> tacit <b>knowledge</b> that can only be achieved in the laboratory setting. In our view, their use should be restricted to that. Non-laboratory practicals ('dry labs'), and especially multimedia practicals, tend to be used for completely different reasons. They are best used to help students achieve specific cognitive skills (such as analysis, synthesis and evaluation) needed to practice science and to carry out scientific inquiry. This article sketches the problems {{associated with the use of}} dry laboratories in science education, presents design considerations for the use of such practicals in science education and presents examples of innovative non-traditional practicals...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the booming}} {{information}} technology, traditionally one-way teaching/learning mode remains dominating the class. Although {{there are some}} education institutes take information system as a supplementary tool and some courses has been taught online, teaching materials in class are in the main the written ones, and online forms of teaching still concentrate in one classroom assisted by programmed media. Generally speaking, textbooks and classrooms are the major vehicles of the education in Taiwan with a main purpose to have face-to-face <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge.</b> The conventional means to education has been criticized as monotonous, depressing and restraining [1]. To orient the situation toward the future that education is a service system with students rather than tutors at the center [2], this paper looks at the application potentials of Web 2. 0 technology to {{be integrated into the}} teaching frameworks. With the core value of Web 2. 0 technology that lies in the empowerment of internet users from sole capabilities to download and reading into one that can upload and share, the paper seeks to construct an educative platform supported by the Web 2. 0 technology with a view to transform conventional forms of tutors-centered education and improve teaching and learning effects. The paper is structurally divided into four sections. Section 1 gives a brief on the Web 2. 0 technology. Section 2 frame the current gaps left by digital educative platforms. Section 3 is to construct a preliminary educative model supported by the Web 2. 0 technology with four elements-website users, contents, virtual community and tools-put into the flowchart. A discussion and recommendation for further research lies in Section 4, which also serves as a conclusion...|$|E
40|$|The {{innovative}} and entrepreneurial drive are constructs that inform the collective American psyche, and {{a balance between}} exclusive, limited rights to knowledge and the free <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> within the public realm constitutes the balance which the patent system should strive to achieve. However, the over-privileging of some with exclusive rights to ideas often works {{to the detriment of}} the American public, accentuates our individual subjective desires, and suppresses our collective conscience. Property Conveyor re-imagines the United States Patent Office. It houses all office programs related to patent review and introduces three new, distinctly public programs: an education forum, courtrooms for patent infringement cases, and a café, all providing the opportunity for discourse on patented information and technology. By refashioning the patent office with a mix of private office programs and related public programs, it becomes a new kind of institution in which the machines of bureaucracy and its effects on public life are brought into a productive relationship. Spiral forms suggest nested relations between interior and exterior, public and private. The spiral begins and ends at distinct points, but along its route, every part is related to all others. In this project, a spiral datum provides the primary horizontal circulation space for all users of the building. In so doing, the spiral coheres a thicket of public and private functions into a single form which produces relations not only between adjacent programs, but across the spectrum of programs within the building. The spiral is an orienting device, coordinating and opening up the functions of a bureaucracy to the city. It is a form through which the public is invited, leading them to express their affirmations and doubts about the patent process and the nature of intellectual property at large...|$|E
40|$|Words like pirates and anti-pirates are {{becoming}} common {{features in the}} cultural political debate of today, and the file-sharing phenomenon has become a more and more delicate and disputed subject. The fact that people are organizing in networks to swap computerfiles with each other has, among other things, led film and music companies {{from all over the}} world to initiate a number of anti-piracy organizations, assigned to protect the right to culture and information. The industrial organization Antipiratbyrån (the Anti-pirate Bureau) and the network Piratbyrån (the Pirate Bureau) have on several occasions been used to represent the prevailing conflict in Sweden. The purpose of this study is to apply a sociological perspective to the collective act of file sharing. Additionally, the purpose is to argue that the activity can be understood as a social movement, although it is rarely referred to as such. By focusing on the distinctly organized part of the file-sharing movement, the goal has principally been to answer how the collective action and the <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> that is taking place within the movement, can be understood and which the fundamental ideas are. The study has its starting point in theories about the cognitive praxis – or core identity – of social movements. Among the methods used, interviews with representatives from Piratbyrån were valuable tools, but also other sources, like the Piratbyrån website and forum along with their participation in the media, have been the basis of the analysis. This led to a few conclusions worth considering. The most important result of the study is that it is relevant to talk about a new social movement. This movement is above all characterized by individual autonomy, expressed in a fundametal belief in the individual and some kind of “egoistic” solidarity. Closely connected to this is the everyday practice that makes the existence of the movement possible. The conclusion of the study is that the use of the technology is experienced as a political act, associated by the activists to a decentralization of power and control. Therefore, any restraint of the technology is also experienced as a restraint of man’s autonomy...|$|E
40|$|Renaissance {{concept of}} space” harbors surely some {{definite}} bonuses for anybody {{embarking on a}} study of the inventive role that philosophy has had, in its happiest moments of life, for human cognition. First, the new suppositions related to physical space emerge in the Renaissance as derivative from the theological-philosophical assumptions of the era: what Renaissance space is can be enunciated quite convincingly {{on the basis of the}} intellectual collisions that the era was allotted to deal with. Thus, as a re-generator of classical culture, the Renaissance had to a degree dug up the finite substructure of ancient thinking; however, as an inheritor of the Middle Ages, it had been requested to square finitism with transcendency. Second, much of what we can today fit under Renaissance space is in fact delivered to us in the artistic form of painting, which means that, in addition to the challenge set by philosophy to the spatial <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the era, there was postulated as well a mediatory agency of art in the realization and <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> this new <b>knowledge.</b> Thus we can suppose that the solution offered by Renaissance art to the problem of space on its fictional plane comprised the germ <b>of</b> some modern <b>knowledge</b> about space in reality. ...|$|R

40|$|Often {{the owner}} of land places it under an oil lease and later conveys fee {{interests}} or mineral or royalty interests in segregated tracts from the leased area. When oil is subsequently produced on some, {{but not all of}} the leased area, problems may arise as to the royalty rights of the lessor and the grantees. Specifically, is the right of each grantee to royalties modified by the fact that his tract {{is part of a larger}} leased area? The problem will be considered in the absence and in the presence of the contractual device known as the entirety clause. Various types <b>of</b> <b>conveyances</b> may give rise to this problem: <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> an interest in the fee; <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> an interest in the minerals under the land; or <b>conveyance</b> <b>of</b> an interest in royalties.
