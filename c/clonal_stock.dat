40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo produce {{comparative}} {{data on a}} group of Trichomonas vaginalis clonal strains with varied drug responses using identical methods and materials. MethodsFive clonal strains of Trichomonas vaginalis were isolated from reference strain using agar plate technique. The variability of growth kinetic and susceptibility of clonal strain to metronidazole, tinidazole, satranidazole and nitazoxanide were observed in 96 well microtitre plate. ResultsAmong these clonal strains there was a good correlation between rates of growth with the relative susceptibility of the strains to drugs in vitro. Regarding metronidazole, tinidazole and satranidazole susceptibility, different degrees of susceptibility were determined. However, no difference in nitazoxanide susceptibility was found between the clonal strain tested and a reference strain. ConclusionsThis is the first description of biological variability in <b>clonal</b> <b>stock</b> of Trichomonas vaginalis. Different degrees of drug susceptibility were determined among clonal strains tested. Further studies will be necessary to ascertain the importance of this variability in clinical infection...|$|E
30|$|In {{the last}} 20 years, {{there has been}} a renewed {{interest}} in redwood as a commercial forest species. This interest was largely driven by the efforts of Bill Libby, then Professor of Forestry at the University of California at Berkeley, USA (Libby 1993; Brown et al. 2008 a). A better understanding of siting for redwood has led to the establishment of young stands with good growth rates, and in some places able to rival the growth rate of radiata pine (Brown, Low, McConnochie et al. 2008 b; Ripley 2009). It has been demonstrated that proper establishment practices and weed control after planting can lead to high survivability and good growth rates (Bowles 1980; Nicholas and Rapley 2008). Some companies have planted <b>clonal</b> <b>stock</b> of redwood designed for relatively short rotations of approximately 35 years (Knowles and Miller 1993; Rydelius 2007). Variability in survival and growth rates has led interested individuals to establish small trials, many of them containing clonal material originating in California (Saunders and McConnochie 2007; Rydelius 2007). However, these trials are still young and have not yet yielded information apart from initial survival and growth rates.|$|E

However, the nature of the influenza DI viral RNA produced from a single <b>clonal</b> <b>stock</b> was essentially identical in all three cells types, suggesting that these cells do not exert a great selective pressure in the amplification of specific DI viral RNAs either at early or late passages. DI viruses produced from one subtype (H 0 N 1) could interfere with the replication of infectious viruses belonging to other subtypes (H 1 N 1, H 3 N 2). DI viral RNAs could also replicate with the helper function of other subtype viruses. The persistent infection of MDBK and HeLa cells could be initiated by coinfecting cells with both temperature-sensitive mutants (ts-) and DI {{influenza virus}}es. Persistently infected cultures cultures at early passages (up to passage 7) showed a cyclical pattern of cell lysis and virus production (crisis), whereas, at later passages (after passage 20), they produced little or no virus and were resistant to infection by homologous virus but not by heterologous virus. The majority of persistently infected cells, however, contained the complete viral genome since they expressed viral antigens and produced infectious centers. Selection of a slow-growing temperature-sensitive variant rather than the presence of DI virus or interferon appears to be critical in maintaining persistent influenza infection in these cells...|$|E

Minimum sprouting (40. 00 %), rooting (33. 33 %), number of shoot (1. 33), primary root (1. 00) and number of secondary root (1. 00) was recorded in cutting diameter (size ＞ 1. 50 cm) in sunlight.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{has been}} described for reliable cultivation in vitro of dispersed fibroblastic cells obtained from normal human organs. The procedure has permitted establishment of stable cell lines from almost every sample taken, among which the following organs were represented: skin, spleen, amnion, lung, liver, bone marrow, brain, muscle, and heart. Equally good growth has been achieved with cells from embryonic or adult tissues. The methods previously developed whereby single cells plated in Petri dishes grow into isolated macroscopic colonies can successfully {{be applied to the}} plating of human fibroblastic stocks. Plating efficiencies in the neighborhood of 50 to 60 per cent are readily achieved with such strains. The resulting colonies can be picked and <b>clonal</b> <b>stocks</b> established. Fibroblastic morphology is maintained in the colonies arising from every single cell of such <b>clonal</b> <b>stocks.</b> All of the single cells from epithelioid clonal strains also maintain their integrity throughout repeated subculture. Since the difference between <b>clonal</b> <b>stocks</b> of these two types is always maintained whenever the respective single cells are plated in the same medium, regardless of the previous history of these stocks, it may be concluded that a true genetic difference exists in these cell lines. In addition to the morphological differences between epithelioid and fibroblastic cell strains, the latter have more demanding nutritional requirements for single cell growth. Thus, single cells of fibroblastic lines almost never produce colonies with high efficiency unless the growth medium which is sufficient for epithelioid cells is supplemented with embryo extract, or a cell feeder layer. Fibroblastic cells are also more resistant to tryptic digestion of the bond uniting the cells to glass surfaces.

40|$|Tropical theileriosis, {{caused by}} the tick-transmitted {{protozoan}} Theileria annulata, is a major disease of cattle in many regions of the developing world. Current research is directed towards developing a sub-unit vaccine, and it is therefore important that genetic diversity in field populations of the parasite is investigated and quantified. The recently completed genome sequence provided an opportunity to develop a panel of genetic markers for population studies and also enabled the identification of novel antigen genes. The genome was bioinformatically screened to identify micro- and mini-satellite loci, several of which were PCR amplified {{from a series of}} diverse parasite stocks in order to characterise their polymorphism and to determine their species-specificity. A panel of ten markers were selected for population genetic studies and were used to genotype laboratorymaintained cell lines and <b>clonal</b> <b>stocks</b> of T. annulata isolated from different countries. Cell lines comprised a multiplicity of genotypes, while <b>clonal</b> <b>stocks</b> showed evidence of a single haploid genome. Preliminary population genetic analysis revealed a large amount of genotypic diversity both between and within countries and indicated that the parasite population is geographically sub-structured. Comparison of a limited number of stocks isolated in different countries demonstrated that genetic differentiation between populations positively correlates with intervening physical distance. A low standard index of association (IS A) suggested that the population in Tunisia is in linkage equilibrium, indicating that the parasite possesses a panmictic (randomly mating) population structure. To confirm these findings, a large number of field isolates from Tunisia and Turkey were analysed (n = 305). This supported the earlier finding that geographical sub-structuring separates panmictic populations and an almost identical amount of genetic differentiation between countries was evident (FST = 0. 05). Limited linkage disequilibrium was observed in some populations and this was attributed to several factors including inbreeding and the Wahlund effect, caused by putatively immigrant sub-populations. A similar multiplicity of infection was demonstrated in vaccinated and unvaccinated animals and the immunising genotype did not appear to establish in the field population. Multiplicity of infection was instead shown to positively correlate with the host age in several sampling locations. The genome of T. annulata was compared with that of T. parva to identify gene families under the influence of positive selection using mean family inter-genomic nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dNdS). Codon usage between the species and between several life-cycle stages within T. annulata was shown to be virtually invariant and independent of the dNdS distribution. In addition to a subset of merozoite genes, which were predicted to be antigens {{on the basis of their}} motif signature, a subtelomeric gene family (SVSP) and a family of parasite-encoded host nuclear genes (TashATs) showed evidence of positive selection between the species. An allelesequencing approach was taken to verify these predictions which indicated that, in general, the TashAT genes are under the effect of purifying selection while two SVSP genes were shown to be highly variable, however there was no firm evidence of positive selection. One of the merozoite antigen candidates showed evidence of both positive immune selection and balancing selection. Consequently, further studies are indicated to assess whether this gene has value as a vaccine candidate. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Factors {{affecting}} {{the reliability of}} Roche/ 454 pyrosequencing for analyzing sequence polymorphism in within-host viral populations were assessed by two experiments: 1) sequencing four clonal simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) stocks and 2) sequencing mixtures in different proportions of two SIV strains with known fixed nucleotide differences. Observed nucleotide diversity and frequency of undetermined nucleotides were increased at sites in homopolymer runs of four or more identical nucleotides, particularly at AT sites. However, in the mixed-strain experiments, the effects on estimated nucleotide diversity of such errors were small in comparison to known strain differences. The results suggest that biologically meaningful variants present at a frequency of around 10 % and possibly much lower are easily distinguished from artifacts of the sequencing process. Analysis of the <b>clonal</b> <b>stocks</b> revealed numerous rare variants that showed the signature of purifying selection and that elimination of variants at frequencies of less than 1 % reduced estimates of nucleotide diversity by about an order of magnitude. Thus, using a 1 % frequency cutoff for accepting a variant as real represents a conservative standard, which {{may be useful in}} studies that are focused on the discovery of specific mutations (such as those conferring immune escape or drug resistance). On the other hand, if the goal is to estimate nucleotide diversity, an optimal strategy might be to include all observed variants (even those at less than 1 % frequency), while masking out homopolymer runs of four or more nucleotides.

40|$|Risks, {{other than}} those {{associated}} with genetic uniformity and reduced genetic diversity, in implementing clonal forestry with Pinus radiata D. Don are often relatively predictable. They include technical and logistical difficulties in large-scale clonal propagation and clonal storage, and difficulties in accurate evaluation of clones. These problems not only impede capture of genetic gain, {{but they can also}} compromise the genetic diversity of deployed clonal material. Clones can be lost through failure in propagation and clonal storage systems. Such failure can occur early on, or it can occur through maturation in clonal storage during the clonal testing phase. As well as outright failure of clonal genotypes in clonal propagation and storage systems, general decline in clonal performance and unwanted intra-clonal variability can cause problems. The latter problem, which includes epigenetic effects and possible somaclonal variation, is sparsely reported but very insidious. Careful management of clonal material in large-scale propagation is therefore crucial, control of maturation being a key factor. Clonal testing, though costly, is important not only for testing the performance of individual genotypes, but also for testing clonal uniformity and the quality of <b>clonal</b> planting <b>stock.</b> <b>Clonal</b> testing can be complicated by genotype-environment interaction, and lack of clonal uniformity due to epigenetic effects, with imprecise evaluations compromising genetic gains.

40|$|Two {{methods for}} simple and rapid plating of single HeLa cells, human, carcinomatous cells, are described. These result in growth and {{formation}} of colonies from each single cell. One of these procedures uses irradiated, non-multiplying "feeder" cells to condition the medium. The second requires more gentle {{handling of the}} cells, but otherwise is virtually {{the same as that}} used in plating bacteria on semisolid, nutrient media. By extension of these methods, it is possible to isolate single mutant colonies and grow pure <b>clonal</b> <b>stocks</b> of animal cells. These genetically uniform strains are much more homogeneous in their behavior than the parental HeLa cell population. Growth curves obtained from developing colonies are highly reproducible. The most active mutant stocks so far isolated display a generation time of 18 to 20 hours. In pooled human serum HeLa cells assume a highly stretched, ameboid form, with marked motility; whereas growth of the same cells in a variety of non-human sera results in tightly packed, columnar, epithelial-like morphology. The two cell types possess volumes, nuclear cross-sections, plating efficiencies, and generation times which are identical within experimental error, but display widely different cross-sectional areas, suggesting that the basic change occurs in the cell surface. It is conceivable that this change may be related to that which enables the cells of a compact tumor to become invasive. Animal cells subjected to the standard trypsinization procedures which involve mechanical trauma and repeated washings in incomplete media leak large amounts of P and suffer impaired ability to reproduce as isolated cells.

We used the parasitemia as the parameter for Chagas disease reactivation and observed that CyI animals infected with T. cruzi stocks showed no reactivation and those infected with T. cruzi II stocks showed only 5 % of reactivation. In contrast, immunosuppressed mice infected with stocks from T. cruzi I lineage showed 77. 5 and 51. 25 % reactivation of the infection when Cyclophosphamide treatment was performed 60 and 180 days after inoculation, respectively. Next, we evaluated the efficacy of the Benznidazole (Bz) pre-treatment in reducing or preventing the recurrence of the infection in these CyI animals. In general, the percentage of the parasite recurrence was not altered among the CyI mice that received the Bz pretreatment during the acute phase of the infection. Interestingly, when pre-Bz treatment was performed during the chronic phase, we observed two different patterns of response: (i) an increased protection among the animals inoculated with the SP 104 cl 1 (genotype 19) and Cuica cl 1 (genotype 20) stocks; (ii) an increased percentage of parasitemia reactivation among mice inoculated with Gamba cl 1 (genotype 19) and P 209 cl 1 (genotype 20) T. cruzi stocks.

Multilocus microsatellite typing (MLMT) was selected to further explore {{the structure of the}} natural populations belonging to these DTUs. The analysis showed that microsatellite clustering does not fully match the six DTUs, but it is relevant for the within DTUs analyses. Population genetics analysis was conducted on 11 relevant subsamples of stocks from Bolivia and Peru, belonging to TcI (6) and TcV (5), defined by four criterions: DTU, vector species, geographic origin, and date of isolation. Most TcV strains presented the same multilocus genotype over all subsamples with the puzzling characteristic that five loci were heterozygous and the other five homozygous. In TcI, four clusters were defined according to the vector species. Most of them appeared in agreement with <b>clonal</b> propagation (<b>stocks</b> isolated from Triatoma infestans and Triatoma sordida), while a few highly homozygous stocks (e. g. those isolated from Rhodnius stali) suggested that scarce sex events can occur.

40|$|AbstractThe tick-borne {{protozoan}} parasite Theileria parva is {{the causal}} agent of East Coast Fever (ECF), a severe lymphoproliferative disease of cattle in eastern, {{central and southern}} Africa. The life cycle of T. parva is predominantly haploid, with a brief diploid stage occurring in the tick vector that involves meiotic recombination. Resolved genetic studies of T. parva are currently constrained {{by the lack of}} a genome-wide high-definition genetic map of the parasite. We undertook a genetic cross of two cloned isolates of T. parva to construct such a map from 35 recombinant progeny, using a genome-wide panel of 79 variable number of tandem repeat markers. Progeny were established by in vitro cloning of cattle lymphocytes after infection with sporozoites prepared from Rhipicephalus appendiculatus ticks fed on a calf undergoing a dual infection with the two <b>clonal</b> parental <b>stocks.</b> The genetic map was determined by assigning individual markers to the four chromosome genome, whose physical length is approximately 8309 kilobasepairs (Kb). Segregation analysis of the markers among the progeny revealed a total genetic size of 1683. 8 centiMorgans (cM), covering a physical distance of 7737. 62 Kb (∼ 93 % of the genome). The average genome-wide recombination rate observed for T. parva was relatively high, at 0. 22 cMKb− 1 per meiotic generation. Recombination hot-spots and cold-spots were identified for each of the chromosomes. A panel of 27 loci encoding determinants previously identified as immunorelevant or likely to be under selection were positioned on the linkage map. We believe this to be the first genetic linkage map for T. parva. This resource, with the availability of the genome sequence of T. parva, will promote improved understanding of the pathogen by facilitating the use of genetic analysis for identification of loci responsible for variable phenotypic traits exhibited by individual parasite stocks...|$|R
40|$|The N. I. Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry (VIR) is {{the only}} {{research}} institution in Russia whose activities and responsibilities include the collecting of plant material from its source populations, maintenance and conservation of plant genetic resources. The VIR and its history are widely known. In 1920 th outstanding Russian plant scientist Nikolay Vavilov was elected as Director of VIR. Nikolai Vavilov first {{called attention to the}} importance of collecting, storing and utilization of exotic germplasm for increasing agricultural production and providing humankind with more food. To this time the origin of conservation of plant genetic resources can be traced. Since 1920 th Nikolai Vavilov and his colleagues visited 65 countries where they systematically collected plant germplasm of crop species and their wild relatives to accumulate and store plant genetic resources ex situ at VIR. Over the 100 years of it s history, VIR has organized 1, 550 expeditions (both international and domestic) to all continents in all of the climatic zones. The VIR collecting missions and collection s evaluation are based on the Vavilov's concepts: 1. The theory of centres of origin of cultivated plants. 2. The law of homologous series in variation. 3. Vavilov s differential method and approach to study ecogeographical diversity. At present VIR holds one of the biggest and oldest plant germplasm collections worldwide. Its collection represents plant diversity of crop species and their wild relatives encompassing 323, 000 accessions of 64 botanical families, of 376 genera, of 2, 169 species including bred varieties, landraces, mutants and wild populations. Plant germplasm collections of VIR are maintained at the experimental stations in different regions of Russia. The germplasm collections are catalogued and characterized. The web-based database (www. vir. nw. ru) provides passport data for VIR collection. The main objectives of VIR are to collect, maintain, document, characterize, evaluate, conserve, regenerate plant germplasm and distribute of seeds and <b>clonal</b> <b>stocks.</b> Much of the material is phenotyped. Inter- and intraspecific diversity of plants is evaluated for resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and for quality traits. Current stocks of VIR gene bank include seed base collections, field-grown plants of vegetatively propagated species, in vitro base collections, cryopreserved material, DNA extracts. VIR provides long-term conservation of seed collections which are stored in sealed glass bottles or in foil packets and kept at - 10 ºC and + 4 ºC in a chambers. Plant seed accessions are divided into: basic (25, 000 accessions) and active (more than 200, 000 accessions) collections. Long-term storage of seeds at low temperature is the most convenient, traditional method for plant germplasm conservation. However, this method is not applicable for vegetatively propagated species. The collections of vegetatively propagated species consist of small berries, fruit crops and grapevine, including about 23, 000 accessions, and a potato collection including about 9, 000 accessions. Most germplasm of the vegetatively propagated crops at VIR is maintained in field collections. However, these collections are endangered by diseases, pests and abiotic stress. To avoid the possible loss of these germplasm collections, new strategies, technologies and information are developed. Currently about 700 stocks of clonally propagated germplasm are stored under in vitro conditions, among them about 300 accessions of berries and fruit crops (raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, cherries, plums, currant, blue honeysuckle) and about 300 stocks of potato. Program of preservation of clonally propagated crops under in vitro conditions includes: testing and eliminating of viral and bacterial diseases, establishing in vitro culture, micropropagation, virus indexing, medium-term in vitro preservation and genotyping. DNA (RAPD and SSR) and isoenzyme markers have been applied to establish a database for cultivar genotyping of potatoes, raspberries and blackberries. Cryogenic facilities have been recently installed at VIR and they are available for developing cryopreservation. At present there are pollen cryocollections (samples of 198 accessions of wild species of some fruit and small berry crops) and cryopreserved winter buds of about 80 accessions of apple). Cryopreservation of in vitro meristem of potato has been recently applied. Long-term conservation of biodiversity of vegetatively propagated plants needs further developing of the theoretical and methodical approaches of in vitro and cryopreservation. This requires greater scientific co-operation in developing and standardizing techniques and methods. vokMyynti MTT, Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|R

In the present study, MyD 88 -deficient macrophages are nonresponsive toward both soluble variant-specific surface glycoprotein (VSG), as well as membrane-bound VSG purified from T. brucei. Infection of MyD 88 -deficient mice with either <b>clonal</b> or nonclonal <b>stocks</b> of T. brucei resulted in elevated levels of parasitemia. This was accompanied by reduced plasma IFN- � and TNF levels during the initial stage of infection, followed by moderately lower VSG-specific IgG 2 a Ab titers during the chronic stages of infection. Analysis of several TLRdeficient mice revealed a partial requirement for TLR 9 in the production of IFN- � and VSG-specific IgG 2 a Ab levels during T. brucei infections. These results implicate the mammalian TLR family and MyD 88 signaling in the innate immune recognition of T. brucei. The Journal of Immunology, 2005, 175 : 2501 – 2509. It is generally accepted that the triggering of an innate immune response is mediated by recognition of invading microorganisms by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) 3 present on APCs (1, 2). Within the family of PRRs, a family of evolutionarily conserved germline-encoded transmembrane receptor...|$|R
40|$|Maritime pine {{contributes}} for {{a leading}} part in socio-economic {{development of the}} French Aquitania region. Sudden and drastic changes in market value and environmental constraints in recent years would need a significant paradigm shift in current breeding technology to deliver suitable varieties. Field comparison of vegetative propagules is a key towards individual selection and efficient capture of the best genetic <b>stocks.</b> <b>Clonal</b> propagation is also required for scaling up production of improved varieties. Somatic embryogenesis is considered as the key technology to fulfil such requirements in maritime pine. Significant {{progress has been made}} during the last 2 decades using immature zygotic embryos as explants. High genotype capture within family at the initiation step is now a reality (77 %). Embryogenic cultures also became an essential support for cryocollection of genetic resources and genetic engineering. Genotype capture at the maturation step calculated as the frequency of lines producing workable yield in cotyledonary somatic embryos is however less than 45 %. In addition, maturation yield and embryo quality are rapidly decreasing in the process of subculturing embryogenic tissue. Field tests established since 1999 revealed that emblings are phenotypically normal plants compared to control seedlings. Initial growth rate is usually lower but can be probably eompensated for by selecting in each family the top elite clones. It is our main challenge to improve somatic embryo quality through a number of comprehensive studies of embryo development such as proteomic analysis. Cytological data suggesting that embryogenicity could also be expressed from mature trees will be presented...|$|R
