5|$|Lay and Skilling went {{on trial}} for their part in the Enron scandal in January 2006. The 53-count, 65-page {{indictment}} covers {{a broad range of}} financial crimes, including bank fraud, making false statements to banks and auditors, securities fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, conspiracy, and insider trading. United States District Judge Sim Lake had previously denied motions by the defendants to have separate trials and to relocate the <b>case</b> <b>out</b> of Houston, where the defendants argued the negative publicity concerning Enron's demise would make it impossible to get a fair trial. On May 25, 2006, the jury in the Lay and Skilling trial returned its verdicts. Skilling was convicted of 19 of 28 counts of securities fraud and wire fraud and acquitted on the remaining nine, including charges of insider trading. He was sentenced to 24 years and 4 months in prison. In 2013 the United States Department of Justice reached a deal with Skilling, which resulted in ten years being cut from his sentence.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel {{construction}} became unintentionally {{involved in}} the women's rights movement when Janet Bonnema was accepted for an engineering technician position {{in the construction of}} the Straight Creek Tunnel in 1970. Bonnema was restricted from entering the tunnel itself, however, due to the miners' superstition that women who entered underground mines and tunnels would bring bad luck. In 1972 Bonnema filed a $100,000 class action suit against the Colorado Department of Transportation, citing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As Colorado voters had passed the Equal Rights Amendment that year, the state settled Bonnema's <b>case</b> <b>out</b> of court for $6,730. Bonnema entered the tunnel for the first time on November 9, 1972, prompting 66 workers to temporarily walk off the job; most returned the next day. She continued with the project until the tunnel opened.|$|E

Moreover, at the completion of the treatment, even a transient increase in the kidney function test was observed in another case. However, there has been observed no other obvious influence.

30|$|The {{software}} {{allowed the}} hybrid and non-hybrid approaches {{to be processed}} using the same step by step wizard workflow. The coregistration was performed automatically by the software. The hybrid approach coregistered the diagnostic CT with the low-dose CT whilst the non-hybrid approach coregistered the diagnostic CT with the SPECT perfusion. The software used a rigid (translation only) mattes mutual information algorithm for both approaches. The coregistration algorithm parameters were identical for both approaches. The manual uniform scaling adjustment was used to compensate for breathing mis-match of the diagnostic CT. For the hybrid method 37 <b>cases</b> <b>out</b> of 61 had no or only little manual adjustments, 24 <b>cases</b> <b>out</b> of 61 had relevant manual adjustments.

Results: The {{results showed that}} p 21 expression was negative in the most components of normal tissue of the salivary gland surrounding pleomorphic adenoma, 24 <b>cases</b> <b>out</b> of 29 of the non tumour duct cells (82. 8 %), and 28 (96. 6 %) <b>cases</b> <b>out</b> of 29 of the acinar cells shows negative p 21 expression.

25|$|Detectives went to Simpson's Rockingham {{estate to}} inform {{him that his}} ex-wife had been murdered. In {{the back of his}} home, they found some blood {{scattered}} all over on a white Ford Bronco. Detective Mark Fuhrman climbed over an external wall and unlocked the gate to allow the other three detectives to enter as well. The detectives argued that they entered without a search warrant because of exigent circumstances—specifically, in this <b>case,</b> <b>out</b> of fear that Simpson might have been injured also. Simpson was not present when the detectives arrived early that morning; he had taken a flight to Chicago late the previous night. Detectives briefly interviewed Kato Kaelin, who was staying in Simpson's guest house. In a walk-around of the premises, Fuhrman discovered a second bloody glove; it was later determined to be the match of the glove found under the bed at the murder scene. Through DNA testing, the blood on this one was determined to have come from both victims. This, together with other evidence collected at both scenes, was determined to be probable cause to issue an arrest warrant for Simpson.|$|E

Others who denied Bentley's charges were Lauchlin Currie, formerly President Roosevelt's economic affairs advisor, William Remington and William Henry Taylor, both midlevel government economists, Duncan Lee, formerly with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and Abe Brothman, a private sector chemist who worked on defense projects. In September 1948, William Remington sued Bentley and NBC for libel. In hopes of discrediting her, Remington's attorneys hired private detectives to look into her past. They were able to produce evidence of her alcoholism, her periods of severe depression and a suicide attempt while a student in Florence, that her master's thesis had been written by someone else, and that, by the standards of her day, she had been sexually promiscuous since her college days.

25|$|While at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, Cruz {{represented}} Pfizer in {{a lawsuit}} brought {{by a group of}} public hospitals and community health centers who accused the drug manufacturer of overcharging. The Supreme Court eventually threw the <b>case</b> <b>out.</b> Shandong Linglong Rubber Company was found guilty of marketing versions of tires that were based on blueprints stolen by a former employee of a Florida businessman and ordered to pay $26 million to the Floridian. Cruz worked on the Chinese company's appellant brief. The appeals court denied the appeal and affirmed the jury's award. Cruz represented drug manufacturer B. Braun Medical Inc. in front of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit after the company was found guilty of wrongfully discharging a former employee. Cruz asserted that she had failed to prove that B. Braun had directed her to violate the law and that she had not presented sufficient evidence that her refusal to violate the law was why she had been fired. The appeals court rejected Cruz's argument and affirmed the $880,000 award. Cruz represented Toyota in an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court in a statute of limitations case, where a judge wanted to investigate Toyota for contempt after a former Toyota in-house lawyer accused Toyota of unlawfully withholding documents in a product liability case. Cruz unsuccessfully argued the judge's jurisdiction expired thirty days after the case was dismissed following an out-of-court settlement, but later won on a second appeal using the same argument.|$|E
