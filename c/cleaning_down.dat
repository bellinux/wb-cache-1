40|$|The firm {{adhesion}} of flavouring particles onto crisp surfaces during {{coating processes}} {{is a major}} concern in the snack production industry. Detachment of flavouring powders from products during handling and production stages can lead to substantial financial losses for the industry, in terms of variable flavour performance and extended <b>cleaning</b> <b>down</b> time of fugitive particle build-up on process equipment. Understanding the adhesion strength of applied bulk particulates used for flavouring formulations will help analysts to evaluate the efficiency of coating processes and potentially enable them to assess the adhesion strength of newly formulated flavouring powder prior to commitment to full scale plant trials. A rapid prototype of a novel adhesion tester has been designed and constructed. The apparatus operates according to the principle of impact force acting on particles attached {{to the surface of the}} food substrate. The main component is a circular plate to which four sample holders are attached and which is subjected to vertical travel down a guide shaft. Several flavouring powders have been tested extensively. By plotting the detachment versus impact force, the difference obtained between adhesion strength of different flavouring powders (which is a strong function of particle size) has been discussed...|$|E

The study is based on well and pipeline historical data of three years (2007, 2008 and 2009). The data included production data (net oil and water cut), choke opening, pipeline pressures, water qualities and scale composition. The study revealed that {{the main cause of}} scale formation is the presence of Ca+ 2 and Mg+ 2 in produced water and wax in oil. The scale consists of 78 % Ca+ 2, 12 % Mg+ 2 and 10 % wax. Investigations on removal methods revealed that the currently employed chemical removal method is effective; however the downtime (well shut down) is high making significant production cut. A method to reduce the <b>cleaning</b> <b>down</b> time is proposed. The pipeline is divided into two sections: aboveground and underground. The aboveground line is characterized with the presence of valves, choke and pipe reductions (i. e. non uniform cross section). The underground section is uniform in cross sectional area. For the aboveground section the current practice of chemical cleaning is recommended to be maintained however, with provision of a bypass line. For underground section the standard practice of pigging is recommended. The proposed cleaning method of the whole pipeline eliminates the downtime completely. In addition it is uncomplicated, with economical operation and installation cost. The method also make significant cut in chemical used hence reduces the hazard and environmental impact...|$|E
40|$|Large river systems {{draining}} the West African Monsoon area deliver sediments and dissolved trace elements into the Gulf of Guinea (GoG) in the easternmost equatorial Atlantic. The different catchment areas of these river systems {{are characterized by}} different geological ages and rock types releasing distinct radiogenic neodymium isotope compositions during weathering which are supplied to the GoG. The main rivers discharging into the GoG are the Niger, the Sanaga, the Nyong and the Ntem with present day εNd signatures of - 10. 5 [1], - 12. 3, - 12. 5 and - 28. 1 [2], respectively. These riverine inputs mix with the tropical Atlantic surface waters. At intermediate water depths Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) prevails whereas the deep basin at this location is mainly filled with NADW. We focus on a marine sediment core that was recovered off the Sanaga and Ntem Rivers and we reconstruct changes in riverine inputs and in mixing of surface and deep water masses over the past 140, 000 years. Changes in riverine inputs most likely reflecting latitudinal shifts of the rainfall zones across the different catchment areas {{were obtained from the}} Nd isotope signatures of the residual detrital fraction of the sediment. Sediment leachates of several GoG core top samples reflect the riverine input from nearby rivers indicating transport of particles coated in the rivers. Both the sediment leachates and the residual detrital fraction show similar patterns, with shifts towards radiogenic values during the interglacials and least radiogenic values during glacial periods. This shift in εNd values may be attributed to the migration of the rainfall zones towards the north during interglacial times and thus implies the increased influence of the northern rivers, the Sanaga and Nyong. The oxidatively-reductively cleaned planktonic foraminiferal calcite of the core top samples in the GoG reflects surface seawater signatures. Non-reductively cleaned planktonic foraminiferal tests and cleaned shallow endo-benthic and epi-benthic foraminiferal tests were used to acquire information about past bottom waters. Difficulties in <b>cleaning</b> <b>down</b> core foraminiferal samples were experienced and these samples appear to be contaminated by secondary manganese and iron bearing phases, even after cleaning. Those phases may have overprinted the original surface water Nd isotope composition in the planktonic foraminiferal tests. As the planktonic and benthic foraminiferal values are overall similar to the sediment leachates, the foraminiferal isotope signatures are most likely overprinted by isotopic signals originating from the rivers due to remobilization processes in the sediments and formation of secondary phases such as Mn-carbonates, which are attached to the foraminiferal calcites.

40|$|The firm {{adhesion}} of flavouring particles onto snack surfaces during {{coating processes}} {{is a major}} concern in the snack production industry. Detachment of flavouring powders from products during handling and production stages can lead to poor appearance and reduced taste of the product as well as substantial financial losses for the industry, in terms of variable flavour performance and extended <b>cleaning</b> <b>down</b> time of fugitive particle build-up on process equipment. Understanding the adhesion strength of applied bulk particulates used for flavouring formulations will help analysts to evaluate the efficiency of coating processes and potentially enable them to assess the adhesion strength of newly formulated flavouring powder prior to commitment to full scale plant trials. Meeting this object has required the development of an over-arching review of the adhesion mechanisms as a primary step. Based on this overview to the work of previous researchers, technological gaps and promising techniques have been identified for further research and development. A prototype of a novel adhesion tester called an Impact Adhesion Tester (IAT) has been designed and constructed. The development of the overall tester design is presented, and details of its parts and the resulting tester are discussed. The IAT and its experimental procedure were primarily designed and implemented for use in the snack industry, in particular, for the measurement and evaluation of the key factors affecting the adhesion behaviour of flavour powder onto snack surfaces qualitatively and quantitatively. This measurement can indicate the percent flavour powder loss within production stages (from coating to packing) and in package. The instrument has been evaluated using different materials and substrates subjected to different coating conditions such as rotational speed of the drum, retention time in drum, the amount of surface oil and the amount of powder applied. By plotting the detachment versus impact force, the difference has been obtained between adhesion strength of different flavouring powders (which is a strong function of particle size, particle shape, particle density and surface oil content of the snack). In addition to the above work, ultra-centrifuge method was used as a reference for comparison. The research work conducted using IAT on flavouring powders has proved the importance of particle adhesion strength and that the particle adhesion strength can reflect the changes in particle loss, based on particle characteristics as well as process conditions during snack production. It proved that bench size IAT would be a useful tester to measure adhesion strength of particles. The results obtained from experiments have confirmed that the tester may be able to usefully determine the variations between different powder materials. However the tester needs to be further evaluated by industrialists and researchers before possible use or commercialisation...|$|E

40|$|Cleaning {{validation}} procedures {{are carried out}} in order to assure that residues of cleaning agents are within acceptable limits after the cleaning process. Cleaning agents often consist of a mixture of various surfactants which are in a highly diluted state after the water rinsing procedure has been completed. This {{makes it difficult to}} find appropriate analytical methods that are sensitive enough to detect the cleaning agents. In addition, it is advantageous for the analytical methods to be simple to perform and to give results quickly. In this study, three different non-specific analytical methods are compared: visual detection of foam, pH and conductivity measurements. The analyses were performed on different dilutions of the cleaning agents Bactericidal Hydroclean and Tickopur R 33. The results demonstrated that the most appropriate method for these detergents are conductivity measurements, by which it is possible to detect concentrations of <b>cleaning</b> agents <b>down</b> to 10 µg/ml.

In the severe environment, the optical characteristics of mirrors will be degraded, hampering the entire performance of the respective diagnostics. A minute impurity deposition of 20 nm of carbon on the mirror is sufficient to decrease the mirror reflectivity by tens of percent outlining the necessity of the mirror cleaning in ITER. The results of R&D on plasma cleaning of molybdenum diagnostic mirrors are reported. The mirrors contaminated with amorphous carbon films in the laboratory conditions and in the tokamaks were cleaned in steady-state hydrogenic plasmas. The maximum cleaning efficiency of 4. 2 nm/min was reached for the laboratory and soft tokamak hydrocarbon films, whereas for the hard tokamak films the carbidization of mirrors drastically decreased the <b>cleaning</b> efficiency <b>down</b> to 0. 016 nm/min. This implies the necessity of sputtering cleaning of contaminated mirrors as the only reliable tool to remove the deposits by plasma cleaning.

40|$|The {{electrokinetic}} {{method used}} for remediation of soil contaminated with heavy metals {{is a new}} developing technique for cleaning soil from heavy metals and radionuclides. By feeding an electric current through soil one induces movement of charges, which is generated by migration of ions and colloids in water present in pores and by reductive reactions {{on the surface of}} electrodes. The aim of the present investigation was to find out whether the electrokinetic soil cleaning method is suitable for cleanup of polluted soils. The method utilizes electrokinesis to drive contaminant species into and through a bed adjacent to a drive electrode. The bed comprises a moderately electrically conductive adsorbent material which is porous and is infused with water or other solvent capable of conducting electrical current. The efficiency of the method depends not so much on soil permeability as on the electric conductivity of water in pores and the distance of movement. The major task and the key goal were to determine suitability of the electrokinetic method for the treatment of soil contaminated with heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn and Pb). Also, it was important to determine the maximum level of cleanup, dependence on the voltage, the level of soil pollution for which this remediation method would prove to be effective for <b>cleaning</b> soil <b>down</b> to the permitted pollution limits, the type of soil most suitable for this remediation technique, the materials of the electrodes, etc. The electrokinetic method is most effective when cleaning polluted sand and sandy loam. The highest efficiency and smallest residual concentrations were reached when removing manganese and chromium from soil. A higher cleaning efficiency is reached applying 29 V rather than 24 V voltage. However, results were quite similar, therefore to clean soil from heavy metals the standard 24 V voltage could be applied, but the cleaning process should be prolonged.

40|$|Purging {{compounds}} {{allow for}} rapid colour and material changes in plastics converting machines. They have both a cleaning and a purging action. The cleaning action {{refers to the}} removal of contaminants, e. g. carbon deposits, from the die, barrel and extruder-screw surfaces. This mechanism relies on conventional detergency in combination with high wall shear stresses. The purging action refers to the observed narrowing in the residence time distribution and is less well understood. The action of a purge compound may encompass both the cleaning and purging mechanisms {{in order to achieve}} the desired effect. In industry the effectiveness of a purge is determined by a visual observation of the extrudate. Therefore, a scientific method was required to quantitatively determine the efficiency of each purging mechanism under a set of fixed experimental conditions. In this study, a method was developed using a laboratory film-blower, which made use of a phthalocyanine blue pigment to impart colour to the film produced. The method was used to test the efficiency of various commercial purge compounds in switching the colour of film from blue to clear. The analysis was achieved by measuring the residual pigment concentration in the blue polymer film using a UV -Visible spectrophotometer. Commercial purge compounds function by means of various mechanisms such as filler abrasion, solvent dissolution, the dislodging of deposits with the aid of surfactants, etc. This study also considered the use of slip additives as an additional purging mechanism. In proposing that slip additives can contribute to a purging action, several slip additives where tested in polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). The slip additives polypropylene wax and polyamide showed {{a significant increase in the}} MFI of PE whereas the additives polar wax and polyamide exhibited a slight increase in MFI of PP. Three additives, namely, polyamide, polypropylene wax and polar wax had showed noticeable improvement on the MFI of ABS. The slip additives that showed a significant improvement in polyethylene were tested together with six different commercial purge compounds. These compounds were tested for their colour change efficiency using polyethylene and switching from blue to clear in a laboratory film blower. It was found that the slip mechanism contributes very little to the purging action. Polymeric materials tend to adhere to hot metal surfaces. When the material continues to adhere to the metal after cooling <b>down,</b> <b>cleaning</b> of the processing equipment becomes very difficult.

40|$|Most commercially {{available}} reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes {{are based on}} the thin film composite (TFC) aromatic polyamide membranes. However, they have several disadvantages including low resistance to fouling, low chemical and thermal stabilities and limited chlorine tolerance. To address these problems, advanced RO/NF membranes are being developed from polyimides for water and wastewater treatments. The following three projects have resulted from my research. (1) 	Positively charged and solvent resistant NF membranes. The use of solvent resistant membranes to facilitate small molecule separations has been a long standing industry goal of the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. We developed a solvent resistant membrane by chemically cross-linking of polyimide membrane using polyethylenimine. This membrane showed excellent stability in almost all organic solvents. In addition, this membrane was positively charged due to the amine groups remaining on the surface. As a result, high efficiency (> 95 %) and selectivity for multivalent heavy metal removal was achieved. (2) 	Fouling resistant NF membranes. Antifouling membranes are highly desired for “all” applications because fouling will lead to higher energy demand, increase of <b>cleaning</b> and corresponding <b>down</b> time and reduced life-time of the membrane elements. For fouling prevention, we designed a new membrane system using a coating technique to modify membrane surface properties to avoid adsorption of foulants like humic acid. A layer of water-soluble polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyacrylic acid (PAA), polyvinyl sulfate (PVS) or sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK), was adsorbed onto the surface of a positively charged membrane. The resultant membranes have a smooth and almost neutrally charged surface which showed better fouling resistance than both the positively charged NF membranes and {{commercially available}} negatively charged NTR- 7450 membrane. In addition, these membranes showed high efficiency for removal of multivalent ions (> 95 % for both cations and anions). Therefore, these antifouling surfaces can be potentially used for water softening, water desalination and wastewater treatment in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) process. (3) 	Thermally stable RO membranes. Commercial RO membranes cannot be used at temperature higher than 45 °C due to the use of polysulfone substrate, which often limits their applications in industries. We successfully developed polyimides as the membrane substrate for thermally stable RO membranes due to their high thermal resistance. The polyimide-based composite polyamide membranes showed desalination performance comparable to the commercial TFC membrane. However, the key advantage of the polyimide-based membrane is its high thermal stability. As the feed temperature increased from 25 oC to 95 oC, the water flux increased 5 - 6 times while the salt rejection almost kept constant. This membrane appears to provide a unique solution for hot water desalination and also a feasible way to improve the water productivity by increasing the operating temperature without any drop in salt rejection...|$|R
