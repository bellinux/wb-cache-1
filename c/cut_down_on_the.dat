5|$|It's About Games {{bought and}} sold used PC games, video games, and board games. Winmark spent roughly $6.8 million to acquire Video Game Exchange Inc. in 1997 and renamed it to It's About Games. It's About Games {{locations}} were largely in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Georgia and Maryland. It made money for Winmark until 1998. During its last year under Winmark management, It's About Games lost $3.4 million because of excessive inventory, a buggy computer system, poorly chosen products, and poorly trained employees. Winmark owned 60 of the 64 It's About Games stores in the franchise {{and would have been}} profitable without It's About Games. Winmark sold or closed all its It's About Games stores in 1999 to reduce losses. Winmark also aimed to <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> number of stores it owned because it wanted to focus on franchisee-owned stores.|$|E

The sets were made larger than life to make the characters look small as the producers could not take children as the schedule of shooting was odd.|$|E
25|$|This railway line {{continued}} operation until 1957, when {{a combination of}} pressures from the National Capital Commission, who wished to <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> number of railway lines through Ottawa {{in an effort to}} eliminate noise pollution, {{as well as from the}} Saint Lawrence Seaway project, which required the removal of the railway's bridge in Cornwall, caused the railway line to shut down. The last trains ran in February 1957, and in April CN purchased the railway track and proceeded to demolish it. Although some segments in Cornwall and Ottawa were retained, the line through Embrun was scrapped. A few decades later, the municipal government constructed a rail trail on the right of way, which remains in use to the present day.|$|E
25|$|Construction on {{the first}} 1.5-mile (2.5km) section, from Canal Street to 22nd Street, was started on May 24, 1929, and the road was officially opened on November 13, 1930, with some inaugural {{vehicles}} using the highway as early as October 28. Traffic was not permitted on the structure until November 17 due to unanticipated delays in cosmetic work. A speed limit of 35 miles per hour (55km/h) was set by Police Commissioner Edward Mulrooney, and trucks were temporarily banned. On the first Sunday the road was in operation, the northbound roadway was backed up for a mile approaching the north end at 23rd Street. The northbound offramp at 23rd Street, unlike the temporary southbound onramp, was built as a permanent single lane ramp, since in the future most traffic would continue along the not-yet-finished elevated highway. Suggested fixes included a new temporary ramp to 25th Street and conversion of the temporary southbound onramp to two-way traffic. The second Sunday the road was open, rain <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> traffic, but police had orders to open the permanent ramp eventually intended for a northbound onramp to exiting northbound traffic if traffic conditions warranted.|$|E

[...] He and other filmmakers worked to <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fight scene, believing that the film's success would come from the character study of Smith's character, John Hancock, similar to Robert Downey, Jr.'s acclaimed portrayal of Tony Stark in the previous May's superhero release, Iron Man.|$|E

Matt Groening developed the lengthy sequence in order to <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> animation necessary for each episode, but devised the two gags as compensation for the repeated material each week. Groening, who had not paid much attention to television since his own childhood, was unaware that title sequences of such length were uncommon by that time. As the finished episodes became longer, the production team were reluctant to cut the stories in order to allow for the long title sequence, so shorter versions of it were developed.|$|E

Members of the media, however, {{labelled}} {{them as an}} [...] "unlikely pair" [...] due to their contrasting personalities. Devgan explained their relationship by saying, [...] "We never resorted to the usual 'I Love you' routine. A proposal never happened. We grew with each other. Marriage was never discussed, {{but it was always}} imminent". They subsequently got married on 24 February 1999 in a traditional Maharashtrian style ceremony at the Devgan house. The wedding was subject to wide media scrutiny, as certain members of the media criticised Kajol's decision to settle down at the [...] "peak of her career".

500|$|Groening {{developed}} a lengthy opening sequence to <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> animation necessary for each episode, but devised two gags as {{compensation for the}} repeated material each week.

This message, which changes from episode to episode, has become known as the [...] "chalkboard gag". The other gag is known as a [...] "couch gag", in which a twist of events occur when the family meets to sit on their couch and watch television. Groening, who had not paid much attention to television since childhood, was unaware that title sequences of such length were uncommon by that time. The theme, which plays over the sequence, was composed by Danny Elfman in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a [...] "retro-style" [...] theme.

The raw fruit also contain parasorbic acid (about 0.4%-0.7% in the European rowan), which causes indigestion and can lead to kidney damage, but heat treatment (cooking, heat-drying etc.) and, to a lesser extent, freezing, neutralises it, by changing it to the benign sorbic acid.

500|$|Not {{originally}} {{conceived as}} a Final Fantasy title, the game began from a prototype of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles to <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> projects costs. The game {{was linked to the}} Crystal Chronicles story through the game mechanic of summoning objects into existence through thought, a theme of the game series. Later in development empire building and strategy genres influenced the gameplay, but effort was made to simplify that genre's usual high learning curve. [...] Many features did not make it into the final game, including a [...] "freeplay" [...] mode with randomly generated dungeons every game, and an epilogue, which was removed for not fitting in with the finished game. The bakery was going {{to be replaced by a}} general store, but using a bakery was more appealing to the developers.

Struthers was particularly saddened by the fact that her character steals food from the same starving children she had been working to help. Parker and Stone were slightly remorseful when they learned of her reaction and have said they did not have anything against Struthers personally. Nevertheless, Struthers was portrayed in an even less flattering way in the third season episode [...] "Starvin' Marvin in Space" [...] as a Jabba the Hutt-like creature. In a DVD commentary track, Parker said of Struthers, [...] "Dude, you're really setting yourself up if you're going to be that fat and go on the air talking about [...] ...

50|$|Many {{caseless}} cartridges {{are also}} telescoped, with {{the bulk of}} the bullet held within the body of <b>the</b> cartridge, to <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> cartridge length. A shorter cartridge <b>cuts</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> distance the firearm's action must reciprocate to load a new round, which allows for higher cyclic rates and greater probability of multiple hits on a target at long range. Lack of a case also reduces the weight of the cartridge substantially, especially in small bore rifles. For example, the caseless ammunition designed by Austrian inventor Hubert Usel (1926—2010) for the Voere VEC-91 weighs about one third as much as regular ammunition for the same caliber.|$|R

It is at that time that Preudhomme, middle-class inhabitant of Lille, recovers the town hall comtale of Annappes, and that the échevinage (municipal council) is given the responsibility to define payments common to the three villages of Annappes, Ascq, and Flers-lez-Lille. Although the territory is rich, the country population is very precarious, and must undergo several famines, from the 14th to the 15th centuries. In particular there was famine during the year 1316, following bad harvests the year before. Another misfortune, that <b>cuts</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> area, is the war of 1297 and 1304, when French troops of Philip IV of France and those of Flemings devastate the cultures and burn the village.
