5|$|Antibody mimetics are organic <b>compounds</b> <b>that,</b> like antibodies, can {{specifically}} bind antigens. They {{are usually}} artificial peptides or proteins with a molar mass of about 3 to 20 kDa. Nucleic acids and small molecules are sometimes considered antibody mimetics, but not artificial antibodies, antibody fragments and fusion proteins are composed from these. Common advantages over antibodies are better solubility, tissue penetration, stability towards heat and enzymes, and comparatively low production costs. Antibody mimetics {{such as the}} Affimer and the DARPin have being developed and commercialised as research, diagnostic and therapeutic agents.|$|E
5|$|Bluebells {{synthesise}} a {{wide range}} of chemicals with potential medicinal properties. They contain at least 15 biologically active <b>compounds</b> <b>that</b> may provide them with protection against insects and animals. Certain extracts – water-soluble alkaloids – are similar to compounds tested for use in combating HIV and cancer. The bulbs of bluebells are used in folk medicine as a remedy for leucorrhoea, and as a diuretic or styptic, while the sap can be used as an adhesive.|$|E
5|$|Care {{needs to}} be taken when {{machining}} hafnium because it is pyrophoric—fine particles can spontaneously combust when exposed to air. <b>Compounds</b> <b>that</b> contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered toxic, but hafnium compounds should be handled as if they were toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds.|$|E

5|$|<b>Compounds</b> <b>that</b> feature {{scandium}} in the {{oxidation state}} other than +3 are rare but well characterized. The blue-black compound CsScCl3 {{is one of}} the simplest. This material adopts a sheet-like structure that exhibits extensive bonding between the scandium(II) centers. Scandium hydride is not well understood, although it appears not to be a saline hydride of Sc(II). As is observed for most elements, a diatomic scandium hydride has been observed spectroscopically at high temperatures in the gas phase. Scandium borides and carbides are non-stoichiometric, as is typical for neighboring elements.|$|E
