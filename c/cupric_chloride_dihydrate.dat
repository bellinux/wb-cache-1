Multiple nucleation developed from pure <b>cupric</b> <b>chloride</b> solutions, however, addition of 0. 5 vol% blood strongly inhibited nucleation. As a result, radial growth of dendrites formed from an average count of about 1. 5 initial growth points (0) per dish was achieved by adding blood. Crystal forms {{in the shape of}} convex lens consisting of two dendrite arches {{near the center of the}} crystal growth point were observed. Their specific crystal growth forms were divided into three categories according to the longer diameter of the convex lens shape: small (S), glucose, creatinine, uric acid, platelets, and ceruloplasmin. The above findings show that blood has an inhibitory effect on nucleation of hydrated <b>cupric</b> <b>chloride</b> crystals and that larger convex lens bodies were formed in the presence of hemolyste of diabetic patients rather than normal controls...|$|R

40|$|Photochemical {{machining}} is a non-conventional {{machining process}} which employs photoresist and chemical etching techniques. Brass which contains 60 - 80 % copper and 20 - 40 %- zinc, {{is the most}} commonly etched copper alloy in the UK. It is used to produce precision parts as well as decorative items. In this study, the most widely üsed''brass (BS CZ 108, ISO CuZn 37) is etched with <b>cupric</b> <b>chloride.</b> The effects of etchant concentration, temperature and hydrochloric acid additions on the etch rate, undercut, etch factors and surface roughness are determined. In comparison to <b>cupric</b> <b>chloride,</b> ferric chloride and alkaline etchants were examined. As an extension to this study, the regeneration of used <b>cupric</b> <b>chloride</b> and recovery of zinc were examined. This investigation was needed because the dissolved brass in the <b>cupric</b> <b>chloride</b> affected the etch rate and surface quality of the etched brass. Therefore the etchant had to be either replaced with fresh etchant and the spent etchant disposed of, or regenerated and the dissolved metal content recovered. The regeneration/recovery process provided an economical solution to environmental considerations. Electrodialysis was used to recover zinc and regenerate <b>cupric</b> <b>chloride,</b> {{and the effect of}} various parameters (i. e. current density, temperature, catholyte solutions) were examined and a comparison of costs between electrodialysis and chlorine regeneration was undertaken. It was noticed that the electrodialysis produced etchant and catholyte wastes. In order to eliminate any waste <b>cupric</b> <b>chloride</b> or catholyte, a further investigation using cementation was undertaken. It was noted that the cementation would successfully decrease disposal of excess solutions...|$|R

Monitoring {{the resistance of the}} fibers at ambient laboratory conditions revealed that only the ferric chloride intercalated fibers were unstable, due to absorption of water from the air. All four types of intercalated fibers were unstable, due to absorption of water from the air. All four types of intercalated fibers were stable for long periods under high vacuum.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work {{was to investigate the}} transition reaction of the calcium silicate hydrate tobermorite into xonotlite under influence of additives. Tobermorite is the main binding agent in steam hardened building materials and the appearance of xonotlite indicates the progress of hardening and an overcuring of the material. Hydrothermal experiments under addition of sucrose, calcium formate and calcium <b>chloride</b> <b>dihydrate</b> to the main components quartz and lime were done using temperatures of 220 °C and a reaction time of 40. 5 h.
