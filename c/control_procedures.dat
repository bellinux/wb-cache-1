5|$|In {{the wake}} of the two airliners lost in the April and May 1958 collisions, {{investigators}} from a House of Representatives committeeconcerned about the lack of coordination between civil and military air traffic controllersimposed a 60-day deadline on the CAB and the Air Force to establish new <b>control</b> <b>procedures.</b> The committee also said that eventually a single civil agency should be given the power to regulate all air space for all types of aircraft. Furthermore, the committee stated that military flying should be controlled in the vicinity of airways not only in instrument weather, but also in visual conditions.|$|E
5|$|At 16:02, {{still waiting}} for a {{definitive}} report on {{the location of the}} Japanese fleet carriers, the U.S. carriers' radar detected the first incoming wave of Japanese strike aircraft. Fifty-three F4F-4 Wildcat fighters from the two U.S. carriers were directed by radar control towards the attackers. However, communication problems, limitations of the aircraft identification capabilities of the radar, primitive <b>control</b> <b>procedures,</b> and effective screening of the Japanese dive bombers by their escorting Zeros, prevented all {{but a few of the}} U.S. fighters from engaging the Vals before they began their attacks on the U.S. carriers. Just before the Japanese dive bombers began their attacks, Enterprise and Saratoga cleared their decks for the impending action by launching the aircraft that they had been holding ready in case the Japanese fleet carriers were sighted. These aircraft were told to fly north and attack anything they could find, or else to circle outside the battle zone, until it was safe to return.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} {{recommended that}} Widerøe update its maps for Brønnøysund, review and improve its landing procedures, improve its internal <b>control</b> <b>procedures</b> {{to ensure that}} pilots follow the airline's flight operation regulations, and introduce the Sterile Cockpit Rule. The commission recommended that the Civil Aviation Administration change the flight paths at Brønnøysund to increase the altitude around Torghatten. Flight 710 was the second of four fatal Widerøe accidents which occurred between 1982 and 1993. In the first accident, Flight 933, a poor cockpit culture had also been discovered, but little was followed up, {{in part because of}} a conspiracy theory which surfaced regarding a collision with a fighter jet. Also in the following two major Widerøe accidents, Flight 893 in 1990 and Flight 744 in 1993, the investigation uncovered operational shortcomings.|$|E

5|$|In August 1996, a Spanish Learjet {{operated}} by Mar Aviation overshot runway 25 and {{collided with a}} van heading eastward on the A40 Western Avenue; the aircraft was carrying an actress bound for Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. The two pilots, the actress and van driver all suffered minor injuries. The ensuing investigation by the Civil Aviation Authority's Air Accidents Investigation Branch found that both the crew's lack of understanding English and military air traffic <b>control</b> <b>procedures</b> had {{contributed significantly to the}} crash. Subsequently, after some thirty years of protracted consideration, an ILS was eventually fitted to Northolt's redefined Runway 25. In addition, aggregate-filled safety pits were installed {{at each end of the}} runway by 21 January 1998 to protect road users in the event of another business jet or military transport failing to stop or ascend before the end of the runway. The House of Commons Transport Select Committee considered the conversion of RAF Northolt to a possible offshoot of Heathrow Airport in the 1990s. While the existing runways would cause aircraft to cross the flightpaths of those using Heathrow, new parallel runways were suggested. These suggestions were opposed by then MP for Ruislip-Northwood, John Wilkinson, and eventually progressed no further.|$|E
5|$|The Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was the inadequate consideration given to human factors limitations in the inspection and quality <b>control</b> <b>procedures</b> used by United Airlines' engine overhaul facility. These resulted in the failure to detect a fatigue crack originating from a previously undetected metallurgical defect located in a critical area of the titanium-alloy stage 1 fan disk that was manufactured by General Electric Aircraft Engines. The uncontained {{manner in which the}} engine failed resulted in high-speed metal fragments being hurled from the engine; these fragments penetrated the hydraulic lines of all three independent hydraulic systems on board the aircraft, which rapidly lost their hydraulic fluid. The subsequent catastrophic disintegration of the disk resulted in the liberation of debris in a pattern of distribution and with energy levels that exceeded the level of protection provided by design features of the hydraulic systems that operate the DC-10's flight controls; the flight crew lost its ability to operate nearly all of them. Despite these losses, the crew was able to attain and then maintain limited control by using the throttles to adjust thrust to the remaining wing-mounted engines. By using each engine independently, the crew made rough steering adjustments, and by using the engines together they were able to roughly adjust altitude. The crew guided the crippled jet to Sioux Gateway Airport and lined it up for landing on one of the runways. Without the use of flaps and slats, they were unable to slow down for landing, and were forced to attempt landing at a very high ground speed. The aircraft also landed at an extremely high rate of descent due to the inability to flare (reduce the rate of descent before touchdown by increasing pitch). As a result, upon touchdown the aircraft broke apart, rolled over and caught fire. The largest section came to rest in a cornfield next to the runway. Despite the ferocity of the accident, 185 (62.5%) passengers and crew survived owing to a variety of factors including the relatively controlled manner of the crash and the early notification of emergency services.|$|E

25|$|Serial {{manufacturing}} of the WS-10 {{and integration}} with the J-11, {{proved to be}} more difficult than expected. As a result, even though several related prototypes had been tested and at least one regiment converted to the Taihang powered J-11B version in 2007, these aircraft were later grounded for an extended period due to a poor operational reliability. A report in the Washington Times suggested that the Chinese engines lasted 30 hours before they needed servicing, compared to 400 hours for the Russian versions. Defects were traced back to the engine manufacturer, Shenyang Liming Aircraft Engine Company employing sub-standard manufacturing and quality <b>control</b> <b>procedures.</b> Several subsequent batches temporarily reverted to the original, Russian AL-31F turbofans. The engines manufacturing problems had finally been solved by the end of 2009 and the WS-10A had reportedly proved mature enough to power the Block 02 aircraft.|$|E
25|$|While {{awaiting}} the long-ballyhooed communist spring offensive, the U.S. improved its forward air <b>control</b> <b>procedures.</b> Lacking the institutional memory to recall prior experience during World War II, the Americans reinvented all-weather bombing and night FAC operations. Newer radio jeeps with 12 channels replaced {{the older ones}} that had only four. Ordnance specialists began loading proximity fused bombs matched to specific targets. Forward airfields were opened to stage aircraft closer to the enemy. When the communist offensive began on 22 April 1951, the 337,000 attacking troops disregarded UN air power and paid a heavy price for it. Tactical aviation from three aircraft carriers became available for close air support on 18 May. In mid-May, radar guided night air strikes killed communist troops within 400 yards of the U.S. 2nd Division, to General Almond's delight. However, even with copious air support, the UN forces gave ground until the communist attack petered out. Then they counter-attacked. Although they drove the communists back, {{for the first time}} the latter did not withdraw out of artillery range as usual to regroup, but clung in place. On 1 July 1951, North Korean Premier Kim Il Sung and General Peng Te-huai agreed to a cease fire as both sides settled into fixed positions. As the communists dug in, there were fewer and less worthy targets vulnerable to tactical air strikes.|$|E

To develop a suitable risk quantification methodology for Bangladesh, the existing methods were investigated and compared for their appropriateness in connection with the proposed analytical pavement design method and the prevailing conditions. The method proposed in this research utilizes the first order second moment theory and an analytical model based on the method of equivalent thickness. For the risk analysis of embankments the first order second moment method was also identified as suitable in the context. An integrated example of the proposed procedure is given, using the data from one of the roads tested.
