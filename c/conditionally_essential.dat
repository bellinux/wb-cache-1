25|$|Arginine is a <b>conditionally</b> <b>essential</b> {{amino acid}} in humans and rodents, {{as it may}} be {{required}} depending on the health status or life cycle of the individual. For example, while healthy adults can supply their own requirement for arginine, immature and rapidly growing individuals require arginine in their diet, and it is also essential under physiological stress, for example during recovery from burns, injury and sepsis, or when the small intestine and kidneys, which are the major sites of arginine biosynthesis have been damaged. It is, however, an essential amino acid for birds, as {{they do not have a}} urea cycle. For some carnivores, for example cats, dogs and ferrets, arginine is essential, because after a meal, their highly efficient protein catabolism produces large quantities of ammonia which needs to be processed through the urea cycle, and if there is not enough arginine present, the resulting ammonia toxicity can be lethal. This is not a problem in practice, because meat contains sufficient arginine to avoid this situation.|$|E

40|$|Using a {{component}} of the Escherichia coli protein degradation machinery, we have established a system to regulate protein stability in mycobacteria. A protein tag derived from the E. coli SsrA degradation signal did not affect several reporter proteins in wild-type Mycobacterium smegmatis or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Expression of the adaptor protein SspB, which recognizes this modified tag and helps deliver tagged proteins to the protease ClpXP, strongly decreased the activities and protein levels of different reporters. This inactivation did not occur when the function of ClpX was inhibited. Using this system, we constructed a conditional M. smegmatis knockdown mutant in which addition of anhydrotetracycline (atc) caused depletion of the beta subunit of RNA polymerase, RpoB. The impact of atc on this mutant was dose-dependent. Very low amounts of atc did not prevent growth but increased sensitivity to an antibiotic that inactivates RpoB. Intermediate amounts of RpoB knockdown resulted in bacteriostasis and a more substantial depletion led to a decrease in viability by up to 99 %.

Sows were administered with dexamethasone (3 mg/sow/ 48 h) from day 70 of pregnancy to the parturition, and then after the birth, the piglets were divided into the group administered with AKG (0. 4 g/kg body weight) or physiological saline. Biochemical markers, lysozyme and ceruloplasmin serum activities, concentrations of selected free amino acids, macro- and microelements and histomorphometry of the liver tissue were determined. The total cholesterol concentrations in the sows and their newborns from the Dex groups were higher by 72 % and 64 %, respectively, compared with the control groups. Triacylglycerol concentration was higher by 50 % in sows from the Dex group and 55 % in the new-born piglets.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Modular protein {{supplements}} {{are added}} to either the diet or enteral formula to increase the protein or amino acid intakes {{of people who are}} nutritionally com-promised. Protein supplements are aggressively marketed to long-term care clinicians because protein energy mal-nutrition and wounds are a common problem in this care setting. It can be challenging for clinicians to distinguish one product from another and to determine the best product for a specific application or nutrition care goal. Modular protein products can be sorted into 4 categories: (1) protein concentrates derived from a complete protein such as milk, soy, or eggs; (2) protein concentrates derived from collagen, either alone or in combination with a complete protein; (3) doses of 1 or more dispensable (nonessential) amino acids; and (4) hybrids of the complete or collagen-based proteins and amino acid dose. Modular protein supplements are generally provided either as a substrate for protein synthesis or as a source of 1 or more amino acids that may be <b>conditionally</b> indispensable (con-ditionally <b>essential)</b> under certain disease conditions. This review provides guidelines for the use of modular protein supplements according to their intended physiologic func-tion and the assessment and nutrition care goals of the long-term care resident. Protein energy malnutrition (PEM) is thought to be a significant problem in the long-term care (LTC) population 1 and is associated with increased mor-bidity and mortality, including impaired wound healing, pressure ulcers, infections, and mortality. 2 Protein malnutrition has several potential causes, including inadequate intake of both energy and protein and inadequate intake of protein in the presence of adequate energy. 3 These conditions can be reversed with provision of adequate protein and energy. Use of a modular protein supplement is a common intervention strategy for the treatment of PEM in the LTC setting.

While a previous study indicated an involvement of autophagy in the execution of apoptosis-incompetent Bax/Bak double knock-out MEFs 2, the exact role of PDT-induced autophagy in apoptosis-competent cells remains largely unclear. In this study we show that in apoptosis-competent cells, the induction of apoptotic cell death occurs concomitantly with the classical characteristics of autophagy, suggesting that both pathways are simultaneously propagated in response to PDT-mediated ER stress. To study the role of autophagy in apoptosis-competent cells we used MEFs <b>conditionally</b> expressing the <b>essential</b> atg-gene Atg 5.

40|$|RACIONAL: A glutamina é o aminoácido mais {{abundant}}e no sangue, por desempenhar importante papel no sistema imune. É considerado aminoácido condicionalmente essencial em situações como desnutrição protéico-calórica. OBJETIVO: Verificar o efeito da dieta suplementada com glutamina sobre variáveis bioquímicas e hematológicas de ratas submetidas a protocolo de desnutrição, induzido por dieta rica em lactose. MÉTODOS: Ratas Wistar fêmeas (n= 20) e com 21 dias de idade, foram submetidas ou não à desnutrição calórico-protéica induzida por diarréia, através da administração de dieta rica em lactose 60 % durante 15 dias. Após o período de desnutrição, animais eutróficos ou desnutridos permaneceram durante 30 dias com oferta de diferentes dietas (padrão e experimentais). De acordo com estado e tratamento nutricionais, os animais foram distribuídos aleatoriamente em quatro grupos distintos: 1) GC: animais eutróficos + dieta padrão, 2) GD: animais desnutridos + dieta rica em lactose (60 %), 3) GDGLN: animais desnutridos + dieta rica em glutamina (2 %); e 4) GDP: animais desnutridos + dieta padrão. Após os 30 dias de tratamento nutricional, amostras de sangue foram obtidas por punção cardíaca para avaliação de variáveis bioquímicas (proteínas totais, albumina, uréia) e hematológicas (quantificação da série vermelha e branca). RESULTADOS: Após 15 dias do início do experimento o ganho de peso dos grupos GD (46, 4 ± 2, 60 g), GDGLN (39, 2 ± 8, 9 g) e GDP (33, 2 ± 11, 5 g) foi menor em relação ao controle (64 ± 4, 24 g, P BACKGROUND: Glutamine is {{the most}} abundant amino acid in blood stream, playing {{an important role in}} the immune system. It is <b>conditionally</b> considered an <b>essential</b> amino acid to certain state conditions such as protein-energy malnutrition. AIM: To verify the effect of glutamine diet supplemented on hematological and biochemical variables in rats subjected to protocol of malnutrition, induced by an enriched lactose diet. METHODS: Total of 20 Wistar females rats, 21 days of age, were submitted or not to the protein-calorie malnutrition induced by diarrhea, using an enriched lactose diet 60 % for 15 days. After malnutrition period, eutrophic or malnourished animals remained for 30 days provided with a variety diet (standard and experimental). According to nutritional status and treatment, animals were randomized into four distinct groups: 1) GC: animals eutrophic + standard diet, 2) GD: malnourished animals + enriched lactose diet (60 %), 3) GDGLN: malnourished animals + enriched glutamine diet (2 %); and 4) GDP: malnourished animals + standard diet. After the 30 days of nutritional treatment, blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture for biochemical (total protein, albumin and urea) and hematological evaluations (red and white blood cells quantification). RESULTS: After 15 days of experimental study, weight gain in the respective groups GD (46. 4 ± 2. 60 g), GDGLN (39. 2 ± 8. 9 g) and GDP (33. 2 ± 11. 5 g) was lower once compared to the control (64 ± 4. 24 g, P < 0. 05). Biochemical examinations showed a significant difference in the urea dosage in GD as compared to other groups (33. 4 ± 4. 77 mg / dL, P< 0. 05). The leukocytes counting of GD (3. 68 ± 1. 0 cel/mm 3 x 103) showed reduced comparing to the rest of the groups (P< 0. 05), while red blood cell counting had not presented significant difference. CONCLUSION: Malnutrition affects leukocytes cell number, although such deleterious counting blood effect can be reversed by simple re-administration of nutrition, regardless of glutamine supplementation. The intake of oral glutamine does not affect the weight gain, biochemical variables of nutritional status, or leukocytes number while malnourished due to enriched lactose diet...|$|R
40|$|The {{goals of}} this thesis are to {{increase}} the understanding of microbial metabolism and to functionally (re-) design microbial systems using Genome- Scale Metabolic models (GSMs). GSMs are species-specific knowledge repositories {{that can be used}} to predict metabolic activities for wildtype and genetically modified organisms. Chapter 1 describes the assumptions associated with GSMs, the GSM generation process, common GSM analysis methods, and GSM-driven strain design methods. Thereby, chapter 1 provides a background for all other chapters. In this work, there is a focus on the metabolically versatile bacterium Pseudomonas putida (chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), but also other model microbes and biotechnologically or societally relevant microbes are considered (chapters 3, 4, 6, 7, 8). GSMs are reflections of the genome annotation of the corresponding organism. For P. putida, the genome annotation that GSMs have been built on is more than ten years old. In chapter 2, this genome annotation was updated both on a structural and functional level using state-of-the-art annotation tools. A crucial part of the functional annotation relied on the most comprehensive P. putida GSM to date. This GSM was used to identify knowledge gaps in P. putida metabolism by determining the inconsistencies between its growth predictions and experimental measurements. Inconsistencies were found for 120 compounds that could be degraded by P. putida in vitro but not in silico. These compounds formed the basis for a targeted manual annotation process. Ultimately, suitable degradation pathways were identified for 86 / 120 as part of the functional reannotation of the P. putida genome. For P. putida there are 3 independently generated GSMs, which is not uncommon for model organisms. These GSMs differ in generation procedure and represent different and complementary subsets of the knowledge on the metabolism of the organism. However, the differing generation procedures also makes it extremely cumbersome to compare their contents, let alone to combine them into a single consensus GSM. Chapter 3 addresses this issue through the introduction of a computational tool for COnsensus Metabolic Model GENeration (COMMGEN). COMMGEN automatically identifies inconsistencies between independently generated GSMs and semi-automatically resolves them. Thereby, it greatly facilitates a detailed comparison of independently generated GSMs as well as the construction of consensus GSMs that more comprehensively describe the knowledge on the modeled organism. GSMs can predict whether or not the corresponding organism and derived mutants can grow in a large variety of different growth conditions. In comparison, experimental data is extremely limited. For example, BIOLOG data describes growth phenotypes for one strain in a few hundred different media, and genome-wide gene essentially data is typically limited to a single growth medium. In chapter 4 GSMs of multiple Pseudomonas species were used to predict growth phenotypes for all possible single-gene-deletion mutants in all possible minimal growth media to determine <b>conditionally</b> and unconditionally <b>essential</b> genes. This simulated data was integrated with genomic data on 432 sequenced Pseudomonas species, which revealed a clear link between the essentiality of a gene function and the persistence of the gene within the Pseudomonas genus. Chapters 5 and 6 describe the use of GSMs to (re-) design microbial systems. P. putida is, despite its acknowledged versatile metabolism, an obligate aerobe. As the oxygen-requirement limits the potential applications of P. putida, there have been several experimental attempts to enable it to grow anaerobically, which have so far not succeeded. Chapter 5 describes an in silico effort to determine why P. putida cannot grow anaerobically using a combination of GSM analyses and comparative genomics. These analyses resulted in a shortlist of several essential and oxygen-dependent processes in P. putida. The identification of these processes has enabled the design of P. putida strains that can grow anaerobically based on the current understanding of P. putida metabolism as represented in GSMs. Efficient microbial CO 2 fixation is a requirement for the biobased community, but the natural CO 2 fixation pathways are rather inefficient, while the synthetic CO 2 fixation pathways have been designed without considering the metabolic context of a target organism. Chapter 6 introduces a computational tool, CO 2 FIX, that designs species-specific CO 2 fixation pathways based on GSMs and biochemical reaction databases. The designed pathways are evaluated for their ATP efficiency, thermodynamic feasibility, and kinetic rates. CO 2 FIX is applied to eight different organisms, which has led to the identification of both species-specific and general CO 2 fixation pathways that have promising features while requiring surprisingly few non-native reactions. Three of these pathways are described in detail. In all previous chapters GSMs of relatively well-understood microbes have been used to gain further insight into their metabolism and to functionally (re-) design them. For complex microbial systems, such as algae (chapter 7) and gut microbial communities (chapter 8), GSMs are similarly useful, but substantially more difficult to create and analyze. Algae are widely considered as potential centerpieces of a biobased economy. Chapter 7 reviews the current challenges in algal genome annotation, modeling and synthetic biology. The gut microbiota is an incredibly complex microbial system that is crucial to our well-being. Chapter 8 reviews the ongoing developments in the modeling of both single gut microbes and gut microbial communities, and discusses how these developments will enable the move from studying correlation to causation, and ultimately the rational steering of gut microbial activity. Chapter 9 discusses how the previous chapters contribute to the research goals of this thesis. In addition, it provides an extensive discussion on current GSM practices, the issues associated therewith, and how these issues can be tackled. In particular, the discussion focuses on issues related to: (i) The inability to distinguish between biological difference and GSM generation artifacts when using multiple GSMs, (ii) The lack of continuous GSM updates, (iii) The mismatch between what GSM predictions and experimental data represent, (iv) The need for standardization in GSM evaluation, and (v) The lack of experimental validation of GSM-driven strain design for metabolic engineering. </p...|$|R
