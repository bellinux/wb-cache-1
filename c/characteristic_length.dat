As a result, the velocity vectors of the stars are steadily modified, and the stars lose any history of their original velocity. The characteristic interval for this to occur is the relaxation time. This is related to the <b>characteristic</b> <b>length</b> of time a star needs to cross the cluster as well as the number of stellar masses in the system. The value of the relaxation time varies by cluster, but the mean value is on the order of 109 years.|$|E

At the lower limit of h the second term disappears. In this case, the equation could have been reformatted {{in terms of the}} acoustical Strouhal number as shown in the second equation above. The characteristic speed U at the nozzle is the sound speed c0. It is interesting that the number is very close to that found by Strouhal for flow over a cylinder.

25|$|Originally, the gauze was heated with a Bunsen burner; later, a wire grid was heated electrically. The heat {{transferred}} to {{the air in the}} tube sets it into near half-wave resonance if the gauze is placed below the midpoint of the tube as shown in the figure on the right. There is no theoretically optimum position, as the wave speed upward is c0+u, the convection speed, while the wave speed downward is c0−u. Without a convection flow, the midpoint and the lower tube end are the best locations for heat transfer. With convection, a compromise position halfway between the two points is normally chosen which depends on the amount of heat added.

A more correct speed would be that characteristic of the swirl fd, where f is the precession (and sound) frequency, based on the Rossby number. To test the relevance of this new characteristic speed, the flow rate was increased and the frequency and level of the sound was measured. Using the dipole model, the calculated force was found to be nearly proportional to (fd)2, confirming the correctness of the new characteristic speed.|$|E

40|$|The {{equations}} {{of motion}} of a second-order continuum equivalent to the periodic masonry made of deformable bricks and mortar are obtained and the overall elastic moduli and the inertial properties are evaluated through a homogenization technique derived from the variational-asymptotic approach proposed by Smyshlyaev and Cherednichenko [23]. The computational method consists in solving two sequences of cell problems in the standard format of vanishing body forces and prescribed boundary displacements. In the first step the classical first-order homogenization is carried out by solving four cell problems; the second step concerns the second-order homogenization and involves the solution of six additional cell problems. The {{equations of motion}} and the wave equation are specialized {{to the case of}} centro-symmetric periodic cells and orthotropic material at the macro-scale, conditions that are common in brick masonry. The <b>characteristic</b> <b>lengths</b> and dispersive elastic waves are obtained. The special cases of <b>characteristic</b> <b>lengths</b> and wave propagation along the orthotropy axes are studied. In the examples running bond and English bond masonry are analyzed by varying the stiffness mismatch between the brick and the mortar. In all cases, the obtained <b>characteristic</b> <b>lengths</b> associated to the shear and extensional strains result to be a fraction of the periodic cell size and become zero for vanishing stiffness mismatch between the brick and the mortar. For both the masonry bonds here considered, the <b>characteristic</b> <b>lengths</b> associated to the shear strain are higher by about an order of magnitude than those associated to the extensional strain. The <b>characteristic</b> <b>lengths</b> along the direction parallel to the mortar joints are prevailing on those along the normal direction. In particular, small <b>characteristic</b> <b>lengths</b> are obtained along the direction normal to the bed mortar joints for both the running bond and the English bond masonry. The wave propagation along the orthotropy axes in both the running bond and English bond masonry is analyzed by considering wave-lengths multiple of periodic cell size. Dispersive waves propagating along the orthotropy direction parallel to the mortar joints are characterized by velocities that differ quite markedly from the corresponding ones in the classical continuum and this difference increases with the increase of the stiffness mismatch between the brick and mortar. Conversely, along the direction perpendicular to the mortar joints the velocity of the shear waves is approximately equal to that in the classical equivalent continuum. These findings show the qualitative similarity of the mechanical behavior of masonry with layered materials...|$|R

For aircraft or ships, the length or width can be used. For flow in a pipe or a sphere moving in a fluid the internal diameter is generally used today. Other shapes such as rectangular pipes or non-spherical objects have an equivalent diameter defined. For fluids of variable density such as compressible gases or fluids of variable viscosity such as non-Newtonian fluids, special rules apply.

Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we show a full comparison between structuring of nanoparticles in confinement and in bulk in order to explain the effect of confinement on <b>characteristic</b> <b>lengths</b> and the scaling law of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>lengths.</b> Three different-sized particle suspensions are used to check the generalization and {{the correlation between the}} <b>characteristic</b> <b>lengths</b> and the system parameters, like particle diameter and Debye <b>length.</b> The two <b>characteristic</b> <b>lengths</b> obtained from AFM force curves, the oscillatory wavelength λ, which is related to the average particle distance, and the decay length ξ, which measures how far particle correlates to obtain periodic oscillations, are in good agreement with the mean particle distance 2 π/qmax and the correlation length 2 /Δq in bulk, respectively, obtained from the structure peaks of SAXS diagrams. Although confinement causes layering of nanoparticles parallel to the confining surfaces, the <b>characteristic</b> <b>lengths</b> in the direction perpendicular to the confining surfaces follow the bulk behavior. The wavelength scales as ρ− 1 / 3 with the particle number density ρ irrespective of the particle size and the ionic strength and shows a pure volume effect. Upon comparing with literature results, the λ = ρ− 1 / 3 scaling law can be applied more generally for charged particles, as long as the repulsive interaction is sufficiently long-ranged, than the previous expression of λ = 2 (R + κ− 1), which only approaches the value of average particle distance under specific conditions. The decay length ξ is controlled both by the particle size and the ionic strength of the suspensions, and ξ = R + κ− 1 is proposed in the paper. In addition, the interaction strength, the force amplitude and maximum scattering intensity, increases linearly with particle concentration. On the other hand, the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and approximate hypernetted chain (HNC) closure calculation based on Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) potential are employed to study the <b>characteristic</b> <b>lengths</b> from the theoretical point of view.
