2500|$|In {{the days}} of the first British railways, [...] "policemen" [...] were {{employed}} by every railway company. Their jobs were many and varied, but one of their key roles was the giving of hand signals to inform engine drivers as to the state of the line ahead. They had no means of communication with their colleagues along the line, and trains were only protected by a time interval; after a train had passed him, a policeman would stop any following train if it arrived within (say) 5 minutes; for any between 5 and 10 minutes after, he would show a <b>caution</b> <b>signal,</b> and after 10 minutes, the line was assumed to be clear. Therefore, if a train failed midsection (as was very common in the early days), the policeman controlling entry to the section would not know, and could easily give a 'clear' signal to a following train when the section was not in fact clear. The number of collisions which resulted from this led to the gradual introduction of the absolute block principle; all systems of working other than this (including time-interval and permissive block) were outlawed on passenger lines in 1889, and all passenger lines were suitably equipped by 1895.|$|E
50|$|The {{driver of}} the Ramsgate train was acquitted of {{manslaughter}} charges after two trials. The Ministry of Transport report found that {{he had failed to}} slow after passing two <b>caution</b> <b>signals</b> so he was unable to stop at the danger signal, concluding that an automatic warning system would have prevented the collision.|$|R
50|$|NOTE: Some {{media outlets}} {{reported}} that Newman {{was the new}} point leader by one point over Stewart after the race. NASCAR scoring freezes immediately upon a <b>caution</b> being <b>signaled,</b> and a <b>caution</b> was <b>signaled</b> on Lap 190 of 188 (the race was extended because of a late-race caution) midway through the lap after a crash. Under NASCAR rules for late-race situations, video of the race is used with the AMB timing system intermediates to determine final placings. Stewart was ahead of Newman by two places when the <b>caution</b> light was <b>signaled.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Ministry of Transport {{report on}} the {{collision}} was published in 1958. Witnesses were interviewed, the visibility of the signals on the line examined, and tests showed no fault in the signalling equipment. The report found that the driver had not slowed for two <b>caution</b> <b>signals,</b> and applied the brakes only after the fireman had called {{to him that he}} had a danger signal. Although he had poor visibility of signals from the driver's seat, he did not cross over to see them, or ask the fireman to look for them.|$|R

50|$|The Thameslink train {{had been}} held at a danger (red) signal until the route was set for it to cross from the Brighton Main Line onto the London Bridge Up Loop Line, and the signal then cleared. The Connex train, which was {{approaching}} from behind, passed a preliminary <b>caution</b> (double yellow) <b>signal</b> then a <b>caution</b> (yellow) <b>signal</b> and then a danger (red) signal. It continued for 283 metres (309 yards) past the red signal until {{the point where the}} two lines converged. It was travelling at an estimated speed of around 39 mph when it collided with the Thameslink train which was estimated to be travelling at around 31 mph. Both trains were derailed and damage was caused to most of the vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Minor {{improvements}} in the 1960s led to the Indusi I 60 system. When a 1000 Hz inductor was encountered, the driver had to acknowledge the <b>caution</b> <b>signal</b> within four seconds. Additionally, a countdown was started to check whether the train had slowed to a specified speed within a specified time frame. Depending {{on the type of}} train the locomotive was hauling, the system could be manually switched between three modes of operation: freight train, low speed and high speed passenger train. In each mode, the system calculated a different speed curve based on the maximum allowable speed and braking characteristics of the train.|$|E

Cyanobacteria react quickly and predictably to a broad range of pollutant. Thus provides potentially constructive early <b>caution</b> <b>signals</b> of worsening environment and the possible causes. Therefore the aim {{of this study is to}} develop an image processing and pattern recognition methods to detect and classify oscillatoria genus from Cyanobacteria found on tropical Putrajaya Lake (Malaysia). Computer-based image analysis and pattern recognition methods were used to construct a system that is able to identify, and classify selected Cyanobacteria genus automatically. An image analysis algorithm was implemented to contrast, filter, isolate and recognize objects from microscope images. Image preprocessing module used to contrast images, to remove the noise, and to improve image quality. Segmentation module used to isolate the different objects found in input image. A combination of Feed forward artificial neural network (ANN) with feature extraction module was used to train and recognize oscillator images. System accuracy was measured by using manual and automated classifying methods, and developed system showed a great accuracy system reach to 90...|$|R

50|$|The race ended under {{controversy}} when Brian Vickers crashed {{with four}} laps to go. At the same time, Jeff Gordon {{was about to}} be passed by Dale Earnhardt, Jr. As Gordon's car was still ahead of Earnhardt's, he kept the lead for the following caution. However, the race never was restarted, and Gordon won the race under the caution, prompting angered fans to throw beverage cups at his car while he celebrated his victory by doing doughnuts on the track. The issue was very similar to the 2002 Indianapolis 500 controversial finish when Hélio Castroneves and Paul Tracy raced when the <b>caution</b> <b>signal</b> was given during Tracy's attempted pass of Castroneves. This led to the implementation of the green-white-checker finish rule in order to avoid such situations in the future.|$|E
50|$|The {{report was}} {{published}} in 1989, and found no fault in the Littlehampton train or signalling system, concluded that the driver had failed to keep the train's speed under control, missing the preceding <b>caution</b> <b>signal</b> and passed the danger signal protecting the Horsham train. The line is equipped with four aspect colour light signalling and British Rail's Automatic Warning System (AWS). However, the report noted that the signal had {{a high incidence of}} being passed at danger - four drivers had previously passed the signal when at danger in the previous five years. The AWS in use gave the same warning for either of the caution signals and danger and was capable of being reset by a driver in a lapse of concentration. The report recommended that an automatic train protection system should be introduced without delay and in the interim a repeater for the signal that had been passed be installed.|$|E
50|$|The {{freight train}} had just passed Eccles station and was {{starting}} to accelerate away when the passenger train, having passed both the Eccles distant <b>signal</b> at <b>caution</b> and home <b>signal</b> at danger, collided heavily with its rear end. It was estimated that the freight train was travelling at about 10 mph, whilst the passenger train's speed was between 45 and 50 mph.|$|R
50|$|The {{appropriately}} coloured lens, {{depending on}} the arm's position, is illuminated from behind by either an oil lamp, a gas lamp, or an incandescent lamp run at a low voltage (white LED clusters have also been tested for this purpose). Where a green light was required, a blue lens would usually be used. When combined with the mainly yellow-emitting flame of an oil lamp, this produced a green colour; {{it was important that}} the resultant colour was not even yellow-green in appearance, as this could have been confused for a distant <b>signal</b> at <b>caution.</b> Later <b>signals</b> using electric lamps used green lenses. Some signals converted to electric lamps from oil used a yellow-tinted bulb with the original blue lens to maintain the correct colour.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{replacement}} of older signals in areas with less traffic, Single Light Colour Light signals were introduced in the 1950s by Mr D.J. Vernon, Signal Engineer. This system is derived directly from British multiple-aspect signalling, with American influence {{in the form of}} a marker light. Using a single green light for Clear and a single yellow light for <b>Caution,</b> these <b>signals</b> exhibit a single red light with a smaller lower red [...] "marker" [...] light for Stop. Turnout indications can be provided with three yellow lights at an angle of 45 degrees under a red light in the main signal head. The fourth indication, Medium, which equates to the British Preliminary Caution, is a flashing or pulsating yellow light.|$|R
5000|$|The ICC investigation, {{published}} on July 30, 1912, centered on why No. 11 failed to stop. Schroeder {{said that the}} fog was very thick as he approached East Corning and that [...] "he was able to distinguish signals only by very carefully watching for them, at times {{they could not be}} seen a distance of one car length". He also admitted that due to problems with the steam injectors he was [...] "not constantly on the watch for the signals" [...] and did not see the <b>caution</b> <b>signal,</b> the fusee or the flagman; only becoming aware of the train ahead when he was 150 feet from it. A member of the New York Public Service Commission stated [...] "The railroad rules are very strict. The engineers are required to know the location of every signal. That is part of their business. It is their duty to observe every signal, if for any reason, they cannot or do not see it as the train passes, it is their duty to regard it as a danger signal and stop the train".|$|E

5000|$|The {{passenger}} train passed Paddock Wood at 20:38½, which was 3½ minutes ahead of time. At that time, the parcels train was occupying track circuit FH. Signal PE129 was showing line clear. The {{passenger train}} cleared track circuits FF and FG, and entered track circuit FH {{which was still}} occupied by the parcels train. The signalman at Ashford sent the [...] "obstruction danger" [...] signal to Tonbridge signal box at 20:42.
