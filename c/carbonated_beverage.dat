25|$|A frozen <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverage</b> is {{a mixture}} of flavored sugar syrup, carbon dioxide, and water that is frozen by a custom machine {{creating}} a drink consisting of a fine slush of suspended ice crystals, with very little liquid. In 1961, Omar Knedlik of Coffeyville, Kansas invented the first frozen carbonated drink machine and is thus recognized as the inventor of the frozen <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverage.</b> In 1965, 7-Eleven licensed the machine, and began selling Knedlik's invention by the brand name popularly known as Slurpee.|$|E
25|$|Though often {{environmental}} and economic agendas may be at odds, the ‘ban the can’ legislation along with being environmentally driven, was also economically motivated as it protected jobs. Seaman's Beverages, a bottling company and <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverage</b> manufacturer, was established in 1939 and a major employer in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Making it illegal to retail cans led to a bigger share of the <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverage</b> market for Seamans. Seamans Beverages was eventually acquired by Pepsi Bottling Group Inc in 2002 prior to {{the lifting of the}} legislation.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the term}} [...] "soft drink" [...] is {{commonly}} used in product labeling and on restaurant menus, in many countries these drinks are more commonly referred to by regional names, including <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverage,</b> cool drink, cold drink, fizzy drink, fizzy juice, lolly water, pop, seltzer, soda, soda pop, tonic, and mineral. Due to the high sugar content in typical soft drinks, {{they may also be}} called sugary drinks. In Spanish, they often use the English equivalent of 'refreshment', or (given its carbonated content) also commonly called gaseosa, from agua gaseosa (literally [...] "fizzy water").|$|E
2500|$|A soda geyser (alternatively Diet Coke and Mentos geyser or Mentos eruption) is a {{reaction}} between the <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverage</b> Diet Coke and Mentos mints {{that causes the}} beverage to spray out of its container.

Lee Marek and [...] "Marek's Kid Scientists" [...] were the first to demonstrate the experiment on television in 1999. Steve Spangler's televised demonstration of the eruption in 2005 went viral on YouTube, launching a chain of several other Diet Coke and Mentos experiment viral videos.|$|E

40|$|A {{wealth of}} {{information}} has appeared on non-scientific publications, some suggesting a positive effect of <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverages</b> on gastrointestinal diseases or health, and others a negative one. The evaluation of the properties of <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverages</b> mainly involves the carbon dioxide {{with which they are}} charged. Scientific evidence suggests that the main interactions between carbon dioxide and the gastrointestinal system occur in the oral cavity, the esophagus and the stomach. The impact of carbonation determines modification in terms of the mouthfeel of beverages and has a minor role in tooth erosion. Some surveys showed a weak association between <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverages</b> and gastroesophageal reflux disease; however, the methodology employed was often inadequate and, on the overall, the evidence available on this topic is contradictory. Influence on stomach function appears related to both mechanical and chemical effects. Symptoms related to a gastric mechanical distress appear only when drinking more than 300 ml of a carbonated fluid. In conclusion there is now sufficient scientific evidence to understand the physiological impact of <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverages</b> on the gastrointestinal system, while providing a basis for further investigation on the related pathophysiological aspects. However, more studies are needed, particularly intervention trials, to support any claim on the possible beneficial effects of <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverages</b> on the gastrointestinal system, and clarify how they affect digestion. More epidemiological and mechanistic studies are also needed to evaluate the possible drawbacks of their consumption in terms of risk of tooth erosion and gastric distress...|$|R
2500|$|For a limnic {{eruption}} to occur, {{the lake}} must be nearly saturated with gas. [...] In the two known cases, the major component was CO2; however, in Lake Kivu, scientists {{are concerned about}} the concentrations of methane gas as well. [...] This CO2 may come from volcanic gas emitted from under the lake or from decomposition of organic material. [...] Before a lake is saturated, it behaves like an unopened <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverage</b> (soft drink): the CO2 is dissolved in the water. [...] In both the lake and the soft drink, CO2 dissolves much more readily at higher pressure (Henry's law). This is why bubbles in a can of soda form only after the can is opened; the pressure is released and the CO2 comes out of solution. [...] In the case of lakes, the bottom is at a much higher pressure; the deeper it is, the higher the pressure at the bottom. [...] This means that huge amounts of CO2 can be dissolved in large, deep lakes. [...] Also, CO2 dissolves more readily in cooler water, such as that {{at the bottom of a}} lake. [...] A small rise in water temperature can lead to the release of a large amount of CO2.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{necessity}} of storing <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverages</b> in more practical and lighter bottles {{has come to}} the replacement of the more traditional glass with the new PET (polyethylene terephthalate). Along with this change new problems have appeared regarding preservations of the beverage’s qualities and the sensorial standard of quality. In this study is analysed the variation of carbon dioxide in certain <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverages</b> stored in polyethylene terephthalate bottles. The possibilities of obtaining mathematical statistical models have been analysed basis on the experimental data in order to predict the variation of the CO 2 inside the samples as a function of volume and time. Another concern of this study was the CO 2 ’s losses starting from the bottling process as well as a comparative average analysis of products proportioning with CO 2 and its loss for three types of concurrent <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverages</b> existing on the market. The obtained results allowed the analyses of the optimal term of validity in accordance with the bottle’s volume.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Elite milers, Sir Roger Bannister and Joseph Falcon, {{have stated}} that the {{consumption}} of <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverages</b> hinders the performance of aerobic events. Oxygen transport is purportedly impaired by the consumption of <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverages.</b> The research on <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverages</b> has been limited to the effects on the digestive system, gastric emptying, and thermal heat stress in animals. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of consuming 28 ounces of <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverages</b> per day, for three weeks, on arterial oxygen saturation (Sa 0 ₂), serum hemoglobin concentrations (Hb), and maximal oxygen consumption (VO₂max) in experienced cyclists. Nine competitive cyclists and triathletes (aged 19 - 24 years, M = 21. 67 years), with average weights and percent body fat of 76. 51 kg and 11. 4 percent respectively, were randomly assigned to a three week period of consuming 28 ounces of carbonated water or a three week period of no <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverages.</b> At the end of each three week period, a 5 c. c. blood sample was taken for Hb determination and the subjects performed a test of maximal oxygen consumption on a cycle ergometer while Sa 0 ₂ was being monitored. The groups then crossed-over with respect to their treatment, and after another three week period, the same variables were measured. The Student's t statistic was used to compare Sa 0 ₂, Hb, and VO₂max. The results showed no significant differences between the carbonated period (C) and the noncarbonated period (NC) in Sa 0 ₂ (94. 00 vs 93. 22...|$|R

The results revealed that breakfast was more often skipped than lunch and supper by both sexes. Significant differences in the food consumption {{between boys and girls}} were noticed at morning snack; beefburgers, liver and egg sandwiches were more consumed by boys, while girls preferred <b>carbonated</b> <b>beverages,</b> cheese, uncarbonated canned drinks and broad beans.
