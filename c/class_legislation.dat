60|$|One of the {{greatest}} dangers, therefore, of democracy, as of all other forms of government, lies in the sinister interest of the holders of power: it is the danger of <b>class</b> <b>legislation,</b> of government intended for (whether really effecting it or not) the immediate benefit of the dominant class, to the lasting detriment of the whole. And {{one of the most}} important questions demanding consideration in determining the best constitution of a representative government is how to provide efficacious securities against this evil.|$|E
60|$|It {{has been}} seen that the dangers {{incident}} to a representative democracy are of two kinds: danger of a low grade of intelligence in the representative body, and in the popular opinion which controls it; and danger of <b>class</b> <b>legislation</b> {{on the part of}} the numerical majority, these being all composed of the same class. We have next to consider how far it is possible so to organize the democracy as, without interfering materially with the characteristic benefits of democratic government, to do away with these two great evils, or at least to abate them in the utmost degree attainable by human contrivance.|$|E

60|$|In {{the long}} run, {{therefore}} (supposing no restrictions to exist {{but those of}} which we have now treated), we might expect that all, except that (it is to be hoped) progressively diminishing class, the recipients of parish relief, would be in possession of votes, so that the suffrage would be, with that slight abatement, universal. That it should be thus widely expanded is, as we have seen, absolutely necessary to an enlarged and elevated conception of good government. Yet in this state of things, {{the great majority of}} voters in most countries, and emphatically in this, would be manual laborers, and the twofold danger, that of too low a standard of political intelligence, and that of <b>class</b> <b>legislation,</b> would still exist in a very perilous degree.

60|$|If it {{be asked}} to what length the {{principle}} admits of being carried, or how many votes might be accorded to an individual on the ground of superior qualifications, I answer, {{that this is not}} in itself very material, provided the distinctions and gradations are not made arbitrarily, but are such as can be understood and accepted by the general conscience and understanding. But it is an absolute condition not to overpass the limit prescribed by the fundamental principle laid down in a former chapter as the condition of excellence in the constitution of a representative system. The plurality of votes must on no account be carried so far that those who are privileged by it, or the class (if any) to which they mainly belong, shall outweigh by means of it {{all the rest of the}} community. The distinction in favor of education, right in itself, is farther and strongly recommended by its preserving the educated from the <b>class</b> <b>legislation</b> of the uneducated; but it must stop short of enabling them to practice <b>class</b> <b>legislation</b> on their own account. Let me add, that I consider it an absolutely necessary part of the plurality scheme that it be open to the poorest individual in the community to claim its privileges, if he can prove that, in spite of all difficulties and obstacles, he is, in point of intelligence, entitled to them. There ought to be voluntary examinations at which any person whatever might present himself, might prove that he came up to the standard of knowledge and ability laid down as sufficient, and be admitted, in consequence, to the plurality of votes. A privilege which is not refused to any one who can show that he has realized the conditions on which in theory and principle it is dependent, would not necessarily be repugnant to any one's sentiment of justice; but it would certainly be so if, while conferred on general presumptions not always infallible, it were denied to direct proof.|$|E

60|$|With {{all this}} array of reasons, {{of the most}} {{fundamental}} character, on the affirmative side of the question, what is there on the negative? Nothing that will sustain examination, when people can once be induced to bestow any real examination upon a new thing. Those indeed, if any such there be, who, under pretense of equal justice, aim only at substituting the class ascendancy of the poor for that of the rich, will of course be unfavorable to a scheme which places both on a level. But I do not believe that any such wish exists at present among the working classes of this country, though I would not answer for the effect which opportunity and demagogic artifices may hereafter have in exciting it. In the United States, where the numerical majority have long been in full possession of collective despotism, they would probably be as unwilling to part with it as a single despot or an aristocracy. But I believe that the English democracy would as yet be content with protection against the <b>class</b> <b>legislation</b> of others, without claiming the power to exercise it in their turn.|$|E
60|$|Walter made {{no secret}} {{in the village of}} his disinclination to believe in Joe Harley's guilt. Joe was a rough fellow, he said, certainly, and he had no {{objection}} to taking a pheasant or two, and even to having a free fight with the keepers; but, after all, our game laws were an outrageous piece of <b>class</b> <b>legislation,</b> and he could easily understand how the poor, whose sense of justice they outraged, should be so set against them. He could not think Joe Harley was capable of a detestable crime. Besides, he had seen him himself within a few minutes before and after the murder. Everybody thought it such a proof of the young parson's generous and kindly disposition; he had certainly the charity which thinketh no evil. Even though his own uncle had been brutally murdered on his own estate, he checked his natural feelings of resentment, and refused to believe that one of his own parishioners could have been guilty of the crime. Nay, more, so anxious was he that substantial justice should be done the accused, and so confident was he of his innocence, that he promised to provide counsel for him at his own expense; and he provided two of the ablest barristers on the Western circuit.|$|E
60|$|I have {{discussed}} this {{question on the}} assumption that the electoral system, in all that depends on positive institution, conforms to the principles laid down in the preceding chapters. Even on this hypothesis, the delegation theory of representation seems to me false, and its practical operation hurtful, though the mischief would in that case be confined within certain bounds. But if the securities by which I have endeavoured to guard the representative principle are not recognized by the Constitution; if provision is not made for the representation of minorities, nor any difference admitted in the numerical value of votes, according to some criterion of the amount of education possessed by the voters--in that case, no words can exaggerate the importance in principle of leaving an unfettered discretion to the representative; for it would then be the only chance, under universal suffrage, for any other opinions than those of the majority to be heard in Parliament. In that falsely called democracy which is really the exclusive rule of the operative classes, all others being unrepresented and unheard, the only escape from <b>class</b> <b>legislation</b> in its narrowest, and political ignorance in its most dangerous form, would lie in such disposition as the uneducated might have to choose educated representatives, and to defer to their opinions. Some willingness to do this might reasonably be expected, and every thing would depend upon cultivating it to the highest point. But, once invested with political omnipotence, if the operative classes voluntarily concurred in imposing in this or any other manner any considerable limitation upon their self-opinion and self-will, they would prove themselves wiser than any class possessed of absolute power has shown itself, or, we may venture to say, is ever likely to show itself under that corrupting influence.|$|E

40|$|Under Canada’s Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act RSC 1985, c C- 36 (“CCAA”), a {{restructuring}} plan typically releases creditor claims against the debtor company. Occasionally, {{a restructuring}} plan will also release creditor claims against third parties, such as the debtor’s auditor. These releases are known as third-party releases. Third-party releases are a controversial feature of Canadian restructuring proceedings. Nonetheless, the approval of third-party releases is an emerging trend under the CCAA. In 2013, Morawetz J approved a 117 million settlement in an Ontario class action. The settlement was approved {{as a part of}} the Sino-Forest Corporation CCAA proceeding. It gave Ernst 2 ̆ 6 Young a full third-party release and barred opt-outs. Some class members argued that the settlement was unrelated to the restructuring and that it violated their opt-out rights under Ontario’s <b>class</b> action <b>legislation.</b> Morawetz J approved the settlement with the third-party release, holding that opt-out rights can be compromised in a CCAA proceeding. Thus, his decision is significant to both insolvency and class action law. This paper analyzes the decision and its implications. The decision demonstrates that CCAA courts are increasingly willing to approve third-party releases, which is a positive development in the law. Proper third-party releases can lead to faster negotiations, larger settlements and smoother restructurings. Thus, releases can maximize benefits for stakeholders and minimize strain on the courts. The decision also clarifies the relationship between the CCAA and <b>class</b> action <b>legislation,</b> striking a suitable balance between insolvency and class action policy goals...|$|R
