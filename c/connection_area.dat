40|$|The {{numerical}} code TOUGH 2 {{was used to}} assess alternative conceptual models of fracture flow. The models that were considered included the equivalent continuum model (ECM) and the dual permeability (DK) model. A one-dimensional, layered, unsaturated domain was studied with a saturated bottom boundary and a constant infiltration at the top boundary. Two different infiltration rates were used in the studies. In addition, the <b>connection</b> <b>areas</b> between the fracture and matrix elements in the dual permeability model were varied. Results showed that the two conceptual models of fracture flow produced different saturation and velocity profiles-even under steady-state conditions. The magnitudes of the discrepancies were sensitive to two parameters that affected the flux between the fractures and matrix in the dual permeability model: (1) the fracture-matrix <b>connection</b> <b>areas</b> and (2) the capillary pressure gradients between the fracture and matrix elements...|$|R

40|$|Laser welding {{of copper}} is gaining {{more and more}} {{importance}} to create electrical contacts due to the high temperature resistance and high achievable mechanical loads. However, laser welding of copper in the past was always associated with low process stability. By using high brightness fiber laser sources, small laser spots can be generated which allows keyhole-based deep penetration welding even in copper with high quality. Unfortunately, a small spot size and keyhole welding lead to a small <b>connection</b> <b>area</b> between the two joining partners. To avoid this, spatial power modulation - a linear feed with superposed circular motion - has been introduced. By using an additional parameter, oscillation frequency, and amplitude, in conjunction with spatial power modulation, we can increase not only the <b>connection</b> <b>area</b> but also {{the stability of the}} laser welding process and quality characteristics of the welds. In addition to the conformity of the weld depth, the surface roughne ss of the weld {{is a measure of the}} quality. Especially in interconnection of lithium ion cells and high power electronics, the consistency of the weld depth influences the <b>connection</b> <b>area,</b> which is essential for the current-carrying capacity. The quantity of weld defects and irregularities has a direct impact on the surface roughness of the weld. This paper presents recent results on the influence of the spatial power modulation on quality characteristics during laser microwelding by analyzing the weld via three-dimensional longitudinal cross sections and via laser measuring of the weld surface. Experimental investigations are supplemented by finite element simulations which enable a detailed analysis of the influence of the laser scanning strategy on the geometry of the fusion zone...|$|E
40|$|After the 1994 Northridge {{earthquake}} it {{was evident}} that the traditional steel moment frames were not as ductile as previously presumed.

This study attempts to develop a new efficient and accurate linear elastic analysis method for moment frames with RBS connections. The method is based on mixed dimensional finite element analysis using multi-point constrain equations. The multi-point constraint equations are derived by equating the work done on either side of the mixed dimensional interface. The method has been applied to specific examples using the general purpose finite element program ANSYS. It has been found that the mixed dimensional models based on the derived constraint equations provide an acceptably accurate and efficient analysis method of moment frames with RBS connections...|$|E

Demonstrated here is a method to evaluate the conditions, taking full advantage of the benefits offered by the indeterminate nature of the structures, and using the well-established, graphical beam-line method. This method shows how important the immediate load take-up is, the stiffness, the moment capacity of the connection and how it all affects the structural behaviour. The examples considered here use both the traditional non-reinforced dowel-type fastener connections and also timber connections reinforced with steel plates. They show that the minimum rotation requirements to achieve an effective structure are satisfied easily in contrast to requirements on stiffness. In this respect, timber connections with local reinforcement glued at the interface of the <b>connection</b> <b>area</b> offer more prospects.

30|$|The {{external}} morphology of {{the dental}} implant {{is a factor}} {{which leads to the}} mechanical engagement of the implant with the bone. Three-thread-design dental implants consist of three different thread designs. The first design is the micro-thread, or supra-fine thread, which is on the coronal third of the implant fixture and is attached to the cortical bone. These small, fine threads are designed for force distribution, an increase in the bone-implant contact area and a decrease in the force concentration at the abutment-implant <b>connection</b> <b>area.</b> The second design is the reverse buttress thread, which is on the middle third of the implant fixture. This design increases the retention between the implant and spongy bone and produces resistance to compressive force. The third design, the condensed thread, is located at the apical third of the implant fixture. The thinness {{at the beginning of this}} thread and an increase in thickness along the implant fixture are designed for the soft spongy bone condensability [2].|$|E

30|$|The {{withdrawal}} {{strength of}} a bolt-nut connector made from wood-based material was evaluated. The thread strength of the wooden bolt-nut connector was tested to select various parameters of the connector {{and the type of}} wood material; the wood materials tested were hard maple, white oak, ebony, glue-laminated bamboo, and densified Japanese cedar. A plane model of wooden threads with various thread angles was also evaluated. The results showed that the maximum failure load of the thread increased with increasing bolt density and <b>connection</b> <b>area,</b> which was calculated from the diameter of the bolt and the thickness of the nut. The withdrawal resistance after reaching the maximum load underwent a graded decrease because the bolt threads were broken one by one. In addition, the thread strength depended on the thread angle. In the model with a thread angle of 90 °, compressive deformation in the transverse direction occurred prior to shear deformation along the root of the threads; the model with this thread angle thus had higher strength than those with other angles.|$|E
