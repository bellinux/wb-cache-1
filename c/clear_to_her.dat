5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Donna {{accepts the}} Doctor's {{original}} offer to travel in the TARDIS. The Doctor makes it <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that he only wants to be friends and nothing more, and she emphatically agrees. She makes a detour to leave her car keys in a litter bin, telling her mother Sylvia to collect them later. While there, she meets a blonde woman and asks her to help Sylvia find the keys. The woman turns out to be Rose Tyler, who fades from view as she walks away from the area. In the final scene, Donna asks the Doctor to fly by her grandfather, Wilfred. He sees her in his telescope and celebrates on his allotment.|$|E
25|$|When the State Bureau of Investigation {{officers}} began {{investigating the}} case late in 2013, they also interviewed residents of Hawthorne at the View. One resident {{who spoke to}} Dulaney said it was <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that the SBI investigators were better trained than their Chapel Hill counterparts had been. The agent who interviewed her asked questions that elicited more useful information from her, she recalled.|$|E
25|$|However, like Aunt Masa, Shukichi is also {{associated}} with the traditions of old Japan, such as the city of Kyoto with its ancient temples and Zen rock gardens, and the Noh play that he so clearly enjoys. Most importantly, he pressures Noriko {{to go through with}} the miai meeting with Satake, though he makes <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that she can reject her suitor without negative consequences.|$|E

It's clear that by Lady Coxon's will {{she may have}} the money, but it's still <b>clearer</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> conscience that the original condition, definite, intensely implied on her uncle's part, {{is attached to the}} use of it. She can only take one view of it. It's for the Endowment or it's for nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|And she, the old spinning-woman, was the apple, eternal, unchangeable, whole {{even in her}} partiality. It {{was this}} which gave the {{wonderful}} <b>clear</b> unconsciousness <b>to</b> <b>her</b> eyes. How could she be conscious of herself when all was herself? ...|$|R

500|$|Pollexfen, {{unwilling to}} be without Byron, decides to kidnap her while she {{attended}} a masquerade at the Haymarket. She is then imprisoned at Lisson Grove {{with the support of}} a widow and two daughters. While he keeps her prisoner, Pollexfen makes it <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that she shall be his wife, and that anyone who challenges that will die by his hand. Byron attempts to escape from the house, but this fails. To prevent her from trying to escape again, Pollexfen transports Byron to his home at Windsor. However, he is stopped at Hounslow Heath, where Charles Grandison hears Byron's pleas for help and immediately attacks Pollexfen. After this rescue, Grandison takes Byron to Colnebrook, the home of Grandison's brother-in-law, the [...] "Earl of L." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{late summer}} {{he was invited}} by Jane Stirling to visit Scotland, where he stayed at Calder House near Edinburgh and at Johnstone Castle in Renfrewshire, both owned by members of Stirling's family. She clearly had a notion of going beyond mere friendship, and Chopin was obliged to make it <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that this could not be so. He wrote {{at this time to}} Grzymała [...] "My Scottish ladies are kind, but such bores", and {{responding}} to a rumour about his involvement, answered that he was [...] "closer to the grave than the nuptial bed." [...] He gave a public concert in Glasgow on 27 September, and another in Edinburgh, at the Hopetoun Rooms on Queen Street (now Erskine House) on 4 October. In late October 1848, while staying at 10 Warriston Crescent in Edinburgh with the Polish physician Adam Łyszczyński, he wrote out his last will and testament—"a kind of disposition to be made of my stuff in the future, if I should drop dead somewhere", he wrote to Grzymała.|$|E
500|$|Although {{she hears}} nothing from Milda after their night together, she still expects to reunite with her dream man shortly, so she breaks off with Tonda, who storms the {{dormitory}} demanding his ring back. After {{listening to a}} speech by the housemother on the virtues of fidelity and commitment, she packs up her suitcase and arrives on Milda's doorstep in the big city, ready to resume their romance. Milda is not home, and she meets his parents, who {{have never heard of}} her and don't know what they should do with her. Milda comes home very late, and after an evening of comically painful tension and uncertainty, his parents decide it's only decent to put the girl up for the night on the sofa, requiring Milda to climb into bed with them in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety. Forman has described this famous scene: [...] "It’s a tight fit. The old man wants to sleep; the son would like to get thrown out so he can join the girl on the couch, but the mother runs the show and won’t tolerate any such filthy ideas under her roof." [...] Andula, kneeling outside the door of their bedroom, overhears the family squabbling, and when it becomes <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that she is not valued in the least, she breaks down in tears and, the next morning, returns to her home. She tells her friends about her [...] "wonderful" [...] trip to the capital and how nice Milda's parents were to her, especially his father, and then she returns to work at the factory.|$|E
500|$|As Sherwood scholar M. Nancy Cutt argues, [...] "the great {{overriding}} {{metaphor of}} all [...] {{work is the}} representation of divine order by the harmonious family relationship (inevitably set in its own pastoral Eden)[...] [...] No writer made it <b>clearer</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> readers that the child who is dutiful within his family is blessed {{in the sight of}} God; or stressed more firmly that family bonds are but the earthly and visible end of a spiritual bond running up to the very throne of God." [...] This is made clear in the Fairchild parents' description of their own authority: ...|$|R
6000|$|But she continued, {{with the}} shadow of <b>her</b> scruple, <b>to</b> explain. [...] "We're many of us, we're most of us--as you long ago saw and showed you felt--{{extraordinary}} now. We can't help it. It isn't really our fault. There's so much else that's extraordinary that if we're in it all so much we must naturally be." [...] It was all obviously <b>clearer</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> than ever yet, and her sense of it found renewed expression; so {{that she might have}} been, as she wound up, a very much older person than her friend. [...] "Everything's different from what it used to be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes--Idella!" [...] Annie {{broke in}} anxiously. [...] "You will leave her with me, Mr. Peck, won't you? You don't {{know how much}} I'm {{attached}} <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> I see her faults, and I shall not spoil her. Leave her with me at least till you see your way <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> having <b>her</b> with you, and then I will send <b>her</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|R
2500|$|She {{claimed that}} during her illness she {{rose from the}} lowest stage, [...] "recollection", to the [...] "devotions of silence" [...] or even to the [...] "devotions of ecstasy", {{which was one of}} perfect union with God (see § Mysticism). During this final stage, she said she {{frequently}} experienced a rich [...] "blessing of tears." [...] As the Catholic distinction between mortal and venial sin became <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> she says she came to understand the awful terror of sin and the inherent nature of original sin. She also became conscious of her own natural impotence in confronting sin, and the necessity of absolute subjection to God.|$|E
2500|$|The next morning, Masha {{was once}} more at home, but very ill. [...] In a feverish delirium, she said {{enough to make}} it <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> mother that she was hopelessly in love with the young officer. [...] Her parents, {{deciding}} that this was a fated love, gave their permission for a wedding. [...] But when they wrote to inform the officer of this fact, his reply was almost incoherent. [...] He begged their forgiveness and insisted that his only hope was death. [...] He rejoined the army (it was now the fatal year of 1812, when Napoleon made his famous attack on Russia), was wounded at the battle of Borodino, and died.|$|E
2500|$|Octavian {{returns to}} Rome in [...] "De Patre Vostro (About Your Father)", and {{establishes}} {{his position as}} the first Roman Emperor. During his triumph, Atia, while intimidating Livia out of her rightful place {{and making sure that}} she herself is seen as the First Woman in Rome, begins to realize that she may {{no longer be able to}} control her son. She begins to sadly ponder on how Octavian developed from a good honest child to a cruel liar and the full weight of her failures both as a mother as well as a politician become <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> When the trophies of Octavian's victory over Antony are paraded before the Senate, she is seen one last time, with a deep sadness in her eyes.|$|E
50|$|Jocelin wrote The Mother’s Legacy <b>to</b> <b>her</b> Vnborn Child {{during the}} Early Modern period when women were {{typically}} defined by their {{existence in the}} domestic sphere.

Schaller of Salon.com.|$|R
6000|$|I {{believed}} {{the case would}} be <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> now.

[...] Demers has referred to this [...] "consciously double vision" [...] as the quintessentially Romantic element of Sherwood's writing.

6000|$|She {{flashed a}} {{slightly}} defiant look at him; it was <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{that he had}} been drawing a satirical portrait of her beforehand.
