40|$|Faced {{with the}} {{prospect}} of converting 200 -page container lists to Encoded Archival Description (EAD), the author programmed a Microsoft Access® database using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to automatically insert the necessary EAD tags and their attributes. Some work is still required to ensure that the <b>container</b> <b>list</b> is properly formatted before importing into the database. Once formatted, the database, named Ead McTaggart, will convert a 7, 000 line Microsoft Excel® <b>container</b> <b>list,</b> where each line represents a series, sub-series, or folder title, into a properly tagged EAD <b>container</b> <b>list</b> in about five minutes. As written, Ead McTaggart will handle up to six component levels, but can be modified to handle more. Although many institutions use Archivists' Toolkit or Archon for this functionality, many libraries and archives who have not implemented those tools will find that EAD McTaggert minimizes the work of converting existing container lists to EAD finding aids with a low time investment for implementation...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project was to arrange and catalog the {{holdings}} of the archive of the International Horn Society at Bracken Library in Muncie, Indiana. This project required: (1) the devising and implementing of a logical system of arrangement consistent with accepted archival practice, (2) the filing of the holdings in archival boxes, and (3) the compilation of a guide composed of annotated <b>container</b> <b>lists,</b> for use as a finding aid. The guide is divided into six parts: (1) Introduction, (II) Brief History of the Society, (III) Scope and Content Note, (IV) <b>Container</b> <b>Lists,</b> (V) Suggestions for Further Research, and Appendices. The Appendices include two lists useful as an index, and a partial list of contents of the Max Pottag Collection. The International Horn Society was founded in 1970 to foster interest in the French horn, and the archive of the Society was established in 1976. The bulk of the present holdings was collected by Robert Marsh during the academic year 1977 - 1978, and dates from 1969 through 1977. Among the types of materials found in the archive are correspondence, photographs, tape recordings and phonograph records.

40|$|The Dezider Scheer Collection {{documents}} select periods {{throughout the}} life and career of Dezider Scheer. The collection consists of correspondence, legal and identification documents, original and photocopied photographs, clippings, Sosúa reunion documents and a scrapbook. Scheer’s correspondence consists of typed, photocopied and hand-written correspondence {{with a variety of}} correspondents in several languages. The Scheer Family series includes Dezider Scheer’s passport, original photographs of the Scheer family children, typed accounts of Scheer family Holocaust survivors and righteous Gentiles, and typed and handwritten memoirs. Also included are photocopied Scheer family trees, deportation lists, and photographs with notations identifying Scheer family relatives. Series III: Jewish settlement in Sosua contains Sosúa-related press clippings in English and Spanish, as well as documents and a scrapbook related to the Sosúa reunions and settlers. Dezider Scheer was born in Slovakia c. 1918. On August 29, 1939, He left Slovakia {{with a small group of}} young men to travel to Palestine illegally, but they were interned in an Italian camp in St. Bertononeo near Salerno. In 1940, Mr. Thorne, a representative from the Dominican Republic Settlement Association (DORSA) came to the camp in Italy and selected potential settlers among the young refugees for a Jewish refugee settlement in Sosúa, Dominican Republic. He selected Dezider Scheer and others. Dezider Scheer arrived in Sosúa in October 1940 and eventually acquired a farm with 25 cows. He also became principal of the local school. In 1950 he decided to leave the Sosúa settlement to join his brother in Canada. He paid his debts to DORSA and settled in Montreal, Quebec. Historical Note:In July 1938 the Évian Conference was convened at the initiative of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt to discuss the issue of increasing numbers of Jewish refugees from Central Europe. In the end the Dominican Republic was the only country willing to accept a large number of Jews, offering citizenship for up to 100, 000 refugees.

40|$|This {{collection}} contains mainly correspondence between {{staff of the}} JDC Landsmanshaftn Department and members of various landsmanshaftn, benevolent organizations of immigrants originally from the same communities, {{as well as between}} the Landsmanshaftn Department and the interest-free loan associations (gmilas khesed societies) and heads of the various Jewish communities, mostly in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The majority of the collection consists of correspondence with some newspaper clippings, photographs, committee meeting minutes, bank reports and receipts from the interest-free loan associations and from individual donors, official documentation about immigration and displaced persons, and a few programs and invitations from various events held by the landsmanshaftn. The materials date from 1926 to 1950 with the bulk dating from 1937 - 1939 and 1945 - 1949. Over 800 communities and countries are represented. Most of the documents for an individual community are in a single folder, however some communities have several folders. The majority of the collection is in English and Yiddish, although various official documents are in Polish, German, Russian, Spanish, French, and Arabic on the documents from various governmental and JDC offices around the world. Folders 41, 43, 117, 155, 234, 246, 307, and 353 contain some information about the activities of TOZ, the Society for the Protection of the Health of the Jewish Population in Poland, including some photographs. Many of the towns have several different names and different ways of spelling these names, depending upon what language is used and what system of transliteration, if any, is used. Most town names are listed by their Polish name and spelling in the container lists, although some folders have information about landsmanshaftn using a transliterated spelling, such as folder 43, labeled Brzesc and containing information about the Brisker Relief Society. Alternate names and spellings are in parentheses following the town name. Some of the folders are labeled according to the name of the landsmanshaft, although they are represented by the town name in the <b>container</b> <b>list,</b> such as folder 824, listed as Satanow but labeled as Satanover Sisterhood Bronx, for Child Transportation to Palestine. Some folders of towns that were known by different names or were so small that former occupants were part of the landsmanshaft of the closest larger town contain only a cross-reference sheet, such as folder 241, Lubar, directing the researcher to folder 378, Rowne. When one landsmanshaft serves multiple towns, the town names are divided by slash marks, such as folder 14, Bendzin (Bedzin) / Sosnowiec, which contains information about the landsmanshaft that serves both Bedzin and Sosnowiec. The materials are arranged chronologically in each folder. The sub-group consists of inter-office memoranda, general correspondence, correspondence with landsmanshaftn, reports from JDC regional offices, acknowledgements of contributions and other materials relating to the operation of the Landsmanshaftn Department (LD). The following series are included: 1. Records of the Landsmanshaftn Fraternal Division, 1937 - 40. Under this name the LD was re-established in 1937 to enlist the cooperation of the landsmanshaftn in the AJDC reconstruction program in Eastern Europe. Consists of LD-Landsmanshaftn correspondence; inter-office memoranda of Mrs. Henrietta Buchman, AJDC Assistant Exec. Secretary and Norman V. Gilimowsky, LD head; communications from local Loan Kassas in Poland and other Eastern European countries. 2. LD Post-World War II records, 1945 - 50 : Relate to generating aid for Holocaust survivors in Eastern Europe and DP camps; accepting earmarked contributions from the Landsmanshaftn for their landslayt abroad; locating relatives; aiding immigrants. Consists of: a. general correspondence and inter-office memoranda of Louis H.

5000|$|Because of {{flammability}} concerns, many product <b>containers</b> <b>list</b> {{safety precautions}} for storage and disposal for varnishes and drying oils {{as they are}} flammable, and materials used to apply the varnishes may spontaneously combust. Many varnishes contain plant-derived oils (e.g. linseed oil), synthetic oils (e.g. polyurethanes) or resins as their binder in combination with organic solvents. These are highly flammable in their liquid state. A highly important note, that is often over looked, all drying oils, certain alkyds (including paints), and many polyurethanes produce heat (an exothermic reaction) during the curing process. Thus, oil-soaked rags and paper can smolder and ignite into flames, even several hours after use if proper precautions are not taken. Therefore, many manufacturers list proper disposal practices for rags and other items used to apply the finish, such as disposal in a water filled container ...|$|R

50|$|In {{computer}} programming, an iterator is {{an object}} that enables a programmer to traverse a <b>container,</b> particularly <b>lists.</b> Various types of iterators are often provided via a container's interface. Though the interface and semantics of a given iterator are fixed, iterators are often implemented {{in terms of the}} structures underlying a container implementation and are often tightly coupled to the container to enable the operational semantics of the iterator. Note that an iterator performs traversal and also gives access to data elements in a container, but does not perform iteration (i.e., not without some significant liberty taken with that concept or with trivial use of the terminology). An iterator is behaviorally similar to a database cursor. Iterators date to the CLU programming language in 1974.|$|R
