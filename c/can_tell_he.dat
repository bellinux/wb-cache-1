500|$|The show's writers admire Grammer's singing voice, and try {{to include}} a song for each appearance. Alf Clausen, the primary {{composer}} for The Simpsons, commented that [...] " [...] is so great. He's just amazing. You <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> has this love of musical theater {{and he has the}} vocal instrument to go with it, so I know whatever I write is going to be sung the way I've heard it." [...] Clausen composed Sideshow Bob's theme, which is played whenever Bob gets out of prison or is about to commit a sinister action, and was first used in [...] "Cape Feare". It is based on the score of the film Cape Fear, composed by Bernard Herrmann. The musical score for [...] "Cape Feare" [...] earned Clausen an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Dramatic Underscore– Series in 1994.|$|E
500|$|American actor Kelsey Grammer {{was brought}} in to guest star as Sideshow Bob for the third time. At that time, Grammer had become a {{household}} name as the lead of the television series Frasier, which was in production {{at the same time as}} this episode. Grammer did not know that the rake scene was extended, because he had only done the moan once and was surprised when he saw the final product. The show's writers admire Grammer's singing voice, and try to include a song for each appearance including this episode. Alf Clausen, the primary composer for The Simpsons, commented that [...] " [...] is so great. He's just amazing.

2500|$|Simona Popescu, the poet-essayist, {{presumes that}} Urmuz's inner {{motivation}} was his [...] "psycho-mania", which holds {{no respect for}} either convention or posterity, but only for committing one's own [...] "abyssal obsessions" [...] to paper: [...] "death, the Eros, creation, and destruction." [...] Adrian Lăcătuș also makes note of Urmuz's ambiguous allusions to autoeroticism, incest, bisexuality or paraphilia. Additionally, various commentators suggest that Urmuz's creative spark hides an unresolved conflict with his father. According to Cernat, Urmuz was in conflict with [...] "paternal authority" [...] and more attached to his mother, an [...] "Oedipus complex" [...] also found in some other literary figures of the pre-modernist generation. Others too see in Ciriviș's pranks a planned revenge against parental and social pressures. His sister Eliza credited such accounts, by noting: [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> failed in life because he obeyed his parents blindly, and perhaps also {{in part due to}} his lack of will, his shyness, his fear of the public." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Nacirema Dream was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. Reed Jackson of XXL praised his storytelling, colorful metaphors and overtly complex word play. He also said, [...] "The production is so outdated you can’t help but think that these songs have literally just been sitting around this whole time. But ultimately, The Nacirema Dream should be celebrated – not only for it’s long overdue release, but because Papoose actually made the album he had always planned on making." [...] Logan Smithson of PopMatters gave the album a seven out of ten, saying [...] "The Nacirema Dream {{is a prime example}} of how hip-hop can serve as a platform for storytelling. Papoose confirms that the hype around his lyrical prowess was real. However, the album isn’t without its faults. Coming out seven years behind schedule, the production is noticeably a little dated. [...] While the beats are solid, The Nacirema Dream isn’t an album that you’ll be listening to because you want to hear great production. It also could have benefited from being slightly trimmed. Listeners might feel fatigued while sitting through the 75 minutes that this album has to offer. Regardless, The Nacirema Dream is an admirable achievement. Papoose fought through label issues and made the album that he wanted to make, even if it took him seven years to finally get that album out to the public." [...] Del F. Cowie of Exclaim! gave the album a six out of ten, saying [...] "Papoose gamely battles on, delivering some of his trademark punch lines, and you <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> genuinely attempted to deliver a well-rounded record. However, there's not enough innovation to interest casual fans in the project." ...|$|E
