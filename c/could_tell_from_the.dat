500|$|In June 2003, Gravel gave {{a speech}} on direct {{democracy}} at a conference hosted by the American Free Press. The event was cosponsored by the Barnes Review, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. In the wake of criticism for his appearance, Gravel has said repeatedly {{that he does not}} share such a view, stating, [...] "You better believe I know that six million Jews were killed. I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, {{and a lot of the}} ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that Barnes Review Conference. I had never heard of the Barnes Review, didn't know anything about it or what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> people in the room (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left. I never saw the agenda for the day or listened to any of the other presentations." ...|$|E
500|$|Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York {{referred}} {{to being a}} [...] "must-see danceumentary." [...] Rothkopf described Jackson as [...] "obviously" [...] having been [...] "shooting for the moon right before his death" [...] {{based on what he}} <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> [...] "stunning bits of concert spectacle" [...] of [...] "phalanxes of computer-generated dancers, tempo changes on a dime, a bombshell of a blond guitarist who plays Eddie Van Halen's [...] "Beat It" [...] solo flawlessly". Rothkopf stated that: [...] "But the true value of this raw rehearsal footage is its emphasis, less known, on MJ's laserlike attention to detail, as he works his band and troupe up to speed. A firm floor manager himself, he's often exposed — and probably wouldn't have approved of this film. (One on one, High School Musicals Kenny Ortega, meanwhile, treats him with kid gloves: [...] "I agree, Michael.") But to see him sweetly lose himself in [...] "Human Nature" [...] ("I like living this way...") is to feel a creature of the stage finally returned home, and possibly on the cusp of redemption." [...] Peter Paras, of E! Online felt that watching Jackson and his performances in a positive aspect is the [...] "genius and the sadness of the entire film." [...] He did note that Jackson's performance of [...] "Earth Song," [...] which consists of using Jackson's voiceover to emphasize his environmental concerns while a bulldozer threatens to eat him, was well-intentioned — because it brought attention to environmental concerns — but felt it was a little over the top. Paras felt the film showed an [...] "exacting and refreshingly funny side of Jackson to be revealed" [...] and [...] "had Jackson lived, we never would have seen those moments" [...] and felt the film was a proper way to [...] "finally say goodbye" [...] to Jackson.|$|E

2500|$|... "The {{irony is}} that it was during the time of {{publication}} that my father's relationship with Judah was most strained, and the point of conflict was over the content of the book. Judah attacked Meeting Soviet Man for being too sympathetic to the west, and too critical of the Soviet Union. I recall one particularly tense meeting at Judah's house. To lighten up the atmosphere he spent the first hour regaling us with colorful stories about the professional boxing bouts he attended in Melbourne's old Festival Hall. Then he and my father retired to another room to talk the issue out. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> grim expressions as they emerged that there had been no resolution of their differences".|$|E
2500|$|Lemmy Kilmister of Motörhead {{intended}} {{to record a}} version of [...] "Black Cat" [...] with Jackson, but was prohibited. Lemmy stated, [...] "I {{wanted to do a}} version of 'Black Cat' with her, but Sony wouldn't let me. You <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> video that she was having a good time, that this loud rock music is what she really wanted to be doing. I love that fuckin' song.. Great fuckin' song that but the record company wouldn't let it be possible." [...] Lemmy later revealed Jackson as his most desired collaboration and planned to record a new version with her for his unreleased solo album Lemmy & Friends, saying [...] "I want to get Janet Jackson to do this great lost single called 'Black Cat'." [...] Dave Navarro recorded an additional opening and riffs throughout the version performed on Jackson's Rock Witchu Tour, appearing on screens during the rendition. Navarro previously collaborated with Jackson when remixing [...] "What'll I Do" [...] with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.|$|E

60|$|No; a dress-suit {{was what}} the hero wore in the movies; and the hero in the movies, when he wasn't a cowpuncher, was an ex-captain of the Yale {{football}} team, and had chambers and a valet.

40|$|Students in Kristin Griffin's Fall 2012 WR 222 Argumentation class {{worked in}} groups to create podcasts {{in which they}} {{considered}} some aspect of Oregon State's culture, community and/or geography {{as it was in}} the past and how it is today.

5000|$|It is also {{frequently}} {{used as an}} auditory symbol of rural America, as in Washington Irving's story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, or as a plot device.

He <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>from</b> <b>the</b> whip-poor-wills.

60|$|About noon the cavalcade {{rode out}} of {{the mouth of a}} canon into a wide valley, {{surrounded}} by high, rounded foot-hills. Horses and cattle were grazing on the green levels. A wide, shallow, noisy stream split the valley.

60|$|In the {{foreground}} I saw the youth who had discovered us, and I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> way he carried {{himself that he}} was quite overcome by his own importance. The warriors about him were all fine looking fellows, though shorter and squatter than the Sarians or the Amozites. Their color, too, was a bit lighter, owing, no doubt, {{to the fact that}} much of their lives is spent within the shadow of the world that hangs forever above their country.|$|E

How do you do, Miss Biggs?" [...] and Mr. Furnival extended {{his hand to the}} lady. They both looked at him, and they <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> brightness of his eye and from the colour of his nose that he had been dining at his club, and that the bin with the precious cork had been visited on his behalf.|$|E
25|$|The two {{wings of}} the army {{attempted}} to confuse and deceive the enemy about their destinations; <b>the</b> Confederates <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> initial movements whether Sherman would march on Macon, Augusta, or Savannah. Howard's wing, led by Kilpatrick's cavalry, marched south along the railroad to Lovejoy's Station, which caused the defenders there to conduct a fighting retreat to Macon. The cavalry captured two Confederate guns at Lovejoy's Station, and then two more and 50 prisoners at Bear Creek Station. Howard's infantry marched through Jonesboro to Gordon, southwest of the state capital, Milledgeville. Slocum's wing, accompanied by Sherman, moved to the east, {{in the direction of}} Augusta. They destroyed the bridge across the Oconee River and then turned south.|$|R
60|$|The jungle seemed ominously quiet. Far {{away in the}} {{distance}} she heard faintly the boom of big guns; {{but she could not}} locate their direction. She strained her ears until her nerves were on the point of breaking; but she <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> whence <b>the</b> sound came. And it meant so much to her to know, for the battle-lines were north of her and if she could but locate the direction of the firing she would know which way to go in the morning.|$|R
40|$|Well I {{never know}} I {{would make it}} back much less get in without Matron seeing me and cutting my tail for being outside without permission. Bread and water for a week.

So I change into my house dress and I get inside without a soul see me. But my heart was still in my mouth <b>from</b> <b>the</b> running and the fright so that if anybody did say one word to me that evening, I would just start to bawl. Then I would let my mouth run away with me and tell them everything. Then dog would nyam my supper for Matron bound to hear...|$|R
60|$|I {{never had}} such an awful night. When Joe and Charley weren't {{throwing}} fits they were making believe, and in the darkness the shivers from the cold which I couldn't see seemed like fits, too. And I shivered so hard I thought I was getting fits myself. And little Albert, with nothing to eat, just drooled and drooled. I never seen him as bad as that before. Why, he twisted that left eye of his until it ought to have dropped out. I couldn't see it, but I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> movements he made. And Joe just lay and cussed and cussed, and Charley cried and wished {{he was back in}} the Home.|$|E
60|$|Our poor horses {{saw them}} also, {{and the sight}} lent them wings, for all the while they {{knew that they were}} running for their lives. This we <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> way they quivered {{whenever}} the baying came near to them, not as horses tremble with the pleasureable excitement of the hunt, but in an extremity of terror, as I have often seen them do when a prowling tiger roars close to their camp. On they went as though they were fresh from the stable, nor did they fail again until another four miles or so were covered and the river was but a little way ahead, for we could hear the rush of its waters.|$|E
60|$|Now {{in front}} of the gateway of the cattle-kraal, shading it, grew a single big tree of the wild fig order. Passing under this tree I looked and saw that the gateway was quite {{securely}} closed, as now I remembered I had noted at sunset. Then I started to go back but had not stepped {{more than two or three}} paces when, in the bright moonlight, I saw the head of my smallest ox, a beast of the Zulu breed, suddenly appear over the top of the wall. About this there would have been nothing particularly astonishing, had it not been for the fact that this head belonged to a dead animal, as I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> closed eyes and the hanging tongue.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Twas a {{point of}} honor with the fine gentlemen of those days to lose or win magnificently at their horse-matches, or games of cards and dice--and you <b>could</b> never <b>tell,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{demeanor}} of these two lords afterwards, which had been successful and which the loser at their games. And when my lady hinted to my lord that he played more than she liked, he dismissed her with a [...] "pish," [...] and swore that nothing was more equal than play betwixt gentlemen, if they did but keep it up long enough. And these kept it up long enough, you may be sure. A man of fashion of that time often passed a quarter of his day at cards, and another quarter at drink: I have known many a pretty fellow, who was a wit too, ready of repartee, and possessed of a thousand graces, who would be puzzled {{if he had to}} write more than his name.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hai!" [...] exclaimed Mahmat, who had lingered close by. [...] "Look, Tuan; {{the logs}} came {{together}} so," [...] {{and here he}} pressed the palms of his hands together, [...] "and his head must have been between them, and {{now there is no}} face for you to look at. There are his flesh and his bones, the nose, and the lips, and maybe his eyes, but nobody <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> one <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other. It was written the day he was born that no man could look at him in death and be able to say, 'This is my friend's face.'" ...|$|R
2500|$|But the {{strategy}} failed {{when he realized}} that the Tonkawa had removed the white bands he had ordered them to put on their heads so he could differentiate between Indian allied and enemy warriors in the heat of battle. [...] (Ford and the most experienced Indian fighters probably <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> the difference, as the Comanche used distinctive dress, headdress, (Buffalo horns), and paint, but most of his men <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> one <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other. [...] Seeing the Tonkawa apparently getting far the worse of the fighting, he signaled them with bugles to retreat. [...] As the Tonkawa withdrew, Ford then ordered a wholesale charge by his Rangers and Militia.|$|R
