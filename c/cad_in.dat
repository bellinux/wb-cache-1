5|$|The 2010 Winter Olympics {{were held}} in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, {{the first time since}} NHL players were allowed to compete that the Olympics {{were held in}} a city with an NHL team. For the first time, Olympic games were played on a {{narrower}} NHL-sized ice rink, measuring 61metres×26metres (200ft×85ft), instead of the international size of 61m×30.5m (200ft×100ft). This change saved an expected $10million (<b>CAD)</b> <b>in</b> construction costs and allowed more spectators to attend games. Games were played at the UBC Winter Sports Centre and Rogers Arena (then GM Place at the time), which was renamed Canada Hockey Place during the event because corporate sponsorship is not allowed for an Olympic venue. Twelve teams qualified for the men's event and were split into three groups of four teams. At the NHL's request, the number of preliminary games was lowered to three. Following the completion of the preliminary round, all teams were ranked 1 through 12 based on points. The top four ranked teams received byes to the quarter-finals, and the other eight teams played for the remaining four positions. Following that, the final eight teams competed in a playoff.|$|E

40|$|Background. An {{association}} between renal hemodynamic dysfunction and {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) has been documented in chronic renal failure; however, no information is available <b>in</b> <b>CAD</b> patients with normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This study was aimed at evaluating early abnormalities and outcome of renal function <b>in</b> <b>CAD</b> patients. Methods. <b>In</b> 15 nondiabetic patients with normal renal function and no significant stenoses in renal arteries, and having undergone coronary arteriography, we studied systemic and renal hemodynamics before and after a vasodilating stimulus induced by aminoacid (AA) infusion. A control group (C) consisted of 15 sex- and age-matched kidney donors. The statistical adequacy of the sample size was preliminarily verified. Renal clearances were repeated after two years. Results. At baseline, GFR (mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2) averaged 81. 4 ± 3. 8 <b>in</b> <b>CAD</b> and 83. 7 ± 1. 4 in C (P = NS); RPF (mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2) was 297 ± 22 <b>in</b> <b>CAD</b> and 456 ± 15 in C (P < 0. 0001); filtration fraction was higher <b>in</b> <b>CAD</b> (P < 0. 001). Plasma renin activity was higher <b>in</b> <b>CAD</b> (P < 0. 005). The number of coronary stenoses was inversely correlated with RPF but not with GFR. <b>In</b> <b>CAD,</b> at variance with C, AA did not induce any increment of GFR, while RPF increased without achieving the unstimulated value of C. Blood pressure was comparable <b>in</b> <b>CAD</b> and C at baseline and not modified by AA. After two years, {{a significant decrease in}} GFR (− 14 %, P < 0. 001) and RPF (− 15 %, P < 0. 001) occurred only <b>in</b> <b>CAD,</b> and <b>in</b> either group, the response to AA did not differ from that detected at baseline. Conclusion. <b>In</b> <b>CAD</b> patients with normal GFR, reduction in renal perfusion and absence of renal functional reserve likely represent early markers of progressive renal dysfunction...|$|R
