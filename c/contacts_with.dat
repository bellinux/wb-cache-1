5|$|The Vlaams Blok {{maintained}} good <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> nationalist parties throughout Europe {{and other}} countries. The Vlaams Blok did traditionally have the closest <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> Dutch and South African far-right groups, including the Dutch Centre Party '86, the Centre Democrats and Voorpost, and the South African Boerestaat Party. In the mid-1980s, it also established close relations {{particularly with the}} French National Front, {{as well as the}} German People's Union, The Republicans and National Democratic Party of Germany. In the 1990s, it supported the minor Dutch Block party, which had modeled itself directly on the Vlaams Blok.|$|E
5|$|The party {{also became}} {{very active in}} {{establishing}} <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> post-communist parties in Eastern European countries, including the Croatian Party of Rights, Slovak National Party and IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement.

40|$|In The Netherlands it {{has been}} shown that people in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> pigs have a higher risk of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{carriage}} than the general population. Isolates of closely related spa types, corresponding to multilocus sequence type (MLST) ST 398, were found in pig farmers, pig veterinarians and pigs. The objective of this study was to investigate whether <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> pigs and veal calves or other livestock is a risk factor for MRSA carriage in Dutch healthcare workers (HCWs). HCWs at four general hospitals and one university hospital were asked to fill in questionnaires covering <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> animals and to take MRSA cultures of their throat and nares. Cultures of HCWs in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> livestock were processed with samples from HCWs <b>with</b> no <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> livestock as controls. Seventy-seven of 1721 HCWs (4. 4 %) reported direct or indirect <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> pigs and/or veal calves and 145 reported <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> other livestock animals. The MRSA carriage rate in the group in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> pigs and veal calves was 1. 7 % and in the control group was 0. 15 %. No carriers were found among HCWs in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> other livestock. An estimated 3 % of hospital staff working in Dutch hospitals serving rural populations belong to a high risk group for MRSA carriage according to the Dutch guidelines. Although MRSA carriage in HCWs in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> livestock is 10 -fold higher than in other HCWs, the difference is not statistically significant...|$|R

40|$|Maintaining {{links with}} the family of origin is {{significant}} to children's welfare. This thesis studies contact arrangements between {{children in foster care}} and their family of origin. <b>Contact</b> <b>with</b> birth parents, siblings and the extended family is explored. A survey of social work case files is carried out. The survey of 136 fostered children reports that children live in long term care. Same sibling placement is uncommon. Children are most frequently in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> siblings, followed by <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the mother. <b>Contact</b> <b>with</b> the father is associated negatively with educational attainment, whilst <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the mother is associated with emotional/behavioural concerns. As a result of the survey's findings, this thesis develops an intensive study of contact. Twenty two children residing in foster care and their 21 foster carers are interviewed. Pictorial vignettes and visual spatial techniques are administered to children. Through these techniques children's views, experiences and wishes of contact are reported. A questionnaire and an interview are also administered to foster carers. Children view <b>contact</b> favourably <b>with</b> siblings and the extended family. Negative emotions are found when <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> parents is discussed. Most children have face-to-face <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> siblings. They also wish to have more <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> siblings. <b>Contact</b> <b>with</b> the extended family such as grandparents is non-threatening. Foster carers hold ambivalent views about contact. Whilst promoting contact, they show reluctance towards children's <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> parents and the extended family. The study reports that both children and foster carers are involved, by practitioners, in contact issues. Moreover, contact is identified as significant to children's identity development. A practice model of contact is discussed in the conclusion of this thesis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

5|$|It {{was found}} that Choor Singh had two private <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> a {{material}} witness {{in the course of}} the disciplinary proceedings, even though it is a well-established rule that a decision-maker should not have contact with any party to the proceedings or any of his witnesses in the absence of the other party or his counsel. The High Court found that there was no actual bias, but there was evidence on which reasonable people might believe that Choor Singh might or could not bring an unprejudiced mind to the disciplinary inquiry. The key finding was that the two private <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> the material witness gave an appearance of a real likelihood of bias. On this basis, the High Court gave the order and quashed the finding of the disciplinary committee. The case was reported as Re Singh Kalpanath (1992).|$|E
