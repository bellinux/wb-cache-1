He served as judge at progressively higher ranks in various locations of Lebanon until he became counselor at the mixed court of appeals in Beirut (in that period, higher courts were presided by French judges). Following the independence of Lebanon, Mahmassani became president of the <b>civil</b> <b>chamber</b> of the court of appeals and cassation of Beirut, the then highest judicial instance in the country.|$|E

Bermúdez Zacarías was {{the secretary of the}} First Tribunal Court of the Twelve Circuit, representing Sinaloa; of the Tribunal Court of Administrative Matters and Work in the Sixteenth District, representing Guanajuato; and in the First Tribunal Unit of the Sixteenth. In December 2013, he became the district court judge of the Sixth Penal Court, responsible for authorizing home raids, preventative arrests, and detainee communication in Mexico City. In March 2016, he served as an appeals court judge responsible for authorizing writs of amparo and presiding civil proceedings at a federal level in the State of Mexico.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Moqadem and Schaar filed {{a lawsuit}} against Lafosse {{demanding}} that they be able to review the film's screenplay. The 4th <b>Civil</b> <b>Chamber</b> of the Court of Brussels ruled that the lawsuit was [...] "admissible but unfounded." [...] However, production had already begun — cast negotiations were finished, and the team had already approached the French government about receiving subsidies — and Lafosse demonstrated no intent to hand over his work. The pair's lawyer subsequently released an official statement: [...] "Moqadem and Schaar feel that this is a violation of their privacy and do not understand why the filmmakers have so little respect for them." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{criminal}} cases were apportioned {{to the two}} criminal chambers on a regional basis. The <b>civil</b> <b>chambers</b> were charged with the many appeals against confiscations of the material goods that were usually part of the death sentences or sentences of perpetual banishment. The management of these forfeited possessions was also an important task of the <b>civil</b> <b>chambers.</b> The case load was nevertheless so overwhelming, {{that at the time}} of the formal abolition of the council a staggering 14,000 cases were still undecided. Aside from judicial functions, the Council also had an important advisory role in the attempts at codification of criminal law, that the government of Alba made in the early 1570s. Because of the development of the Revolt, these laudable attempts came to nothing, however.|$|R
50|$|The Court {{is divided}} into 30 {{chambers}} according to their particular specialized field. There are 20 <b>civil</b> <b>chambers,</b> 10 penal chambers. Until 2001 there were 21 civil and 11 criminal chambers. A chamber has five members, {{one of which is}} president of the chamber. Judgments are taken by majority. One elected judge by the all judges of the Court of Cassation presides over the entire Court as general President. All presidents and judge-members of <b>civil</b> <b>chambers</b> form the General Civil Assembly, and all presidents and judge-members of criminal chambers constitute General Criminal Assembly (tr: Yargıtay Ceza Genel Kurulu). The General Assemblies decide on cases, if the lower court does not comply with the chamber's decision, persisting in its own decision and on cases that the Chief Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation has appealed. There are 250 high judges, 32 heads of chamber and 440 rapporteur-judges whose duty is to carry out preliminary preparation and to explain case-file to the judge-members of this Court and 144 prosecutors working at the Court of Cassation. In the <b>civil</b> <b>chambers,</b> average case-file number which come to these chambers annually is 261,716 and duration of handling the case-file changes from two months to three months. In the criminal chambers, 139,025 case-files are concluded on the average annually.|$|R
50|$|Decisions of the Civil Court, {{with the}} {{exception}} of decisions regarding appeals against decisions of the Justice of the Peace or the Police Court, can be appealed against to the <b>civil</b> <b>chambers</b> of the Court of Appeal.

5000|$|Alba {{hoped the}} {{confiscations}} {{that accompanied the}} condemnations would be {{an important source of}} income for the Crown. However, Philip directed him to pay new pensions from the proceeds to people who had served the Crown well in previous years. Also, the council's <b>civil</b> <b>chambers</b> were swamped with claims concerning the legality of the confiscations. Nevertheless, the proceeds reached half a million ducats annually according to a letter from the Spanish ambassador in France to Philip in 1572.|$|R

50|$|One thing {{special about}} the Supreme Court of Taiwan {{is that it}} has many chambers. Now there are 9 {{criminal}} chambers and 8 civll chambers, each consists of 5 judges. All the appeal cases are decided by these chambers. Because these chambers might have different opinions, the function of the Supreme Court to unify the construction of the law in the country is substantially diminished. In order to unify the opinions, judges in <b>civil</b> <b>chambers</b> and criminal chambers hold meetings regularly and make resolutions on legal questions. Those resolutions are not officially binding, but have de facto binding effect.|$|R
50|$|A new crisis arose at {{the same}} time in the heart of the Supreme Court, since Quesnay de Beaurepaire, President of the <b>Civil</b> <b>Chamber,</b> accused the Criminal Chamber of dreyfusism in the press. He {{resigned}} on 8 January 1899 as a hero of the nationalist cause. This crisis led to the divestiture of the Criminal Division in favour of joint chambers. This was the point of blockage for the review.|$|E
50|$|Subsequently, President Ruiz Conde de Castilla {{appointed}} him Acting Mayor of Riobamba, a post he held for three years. This was {{in response to}} an uprising by the indigenous tribes of Guamote. Though he later showed great concern for indigenous peoples, he responded severely in this case. On August 10, 1809, he was made Senator of the <b>Civil</b> <b>Chamber,</b> created to replace the royal Audience. In 1806, he was made mayor.|$|E
50|$|On 16 December 1843, Guizot removed Teste {{from the}} {{ministry}} but gave him major compensation, including {{making him a}} peer of France {{and head of the}} Cour de cassation. A member of the royal family even intervened in his favour by requesting the retiring president of the <b>civil</b> <b>chamber</b> to name Teste as his successor. Becoming a grand officer of the Légion d'honneur in 1846, he had thus reached the highest honours.|$|E
50|$|At first, {{the council}} acted as an {{advisory}} {{council of the}} Duke, who decided on all verdicts himself. As {{the number of cases}} grew into the thousands in the years following the early sensational trials, this was not practicable. Alba therefore instituted two criminal and two <b>civil</b> <b>Chambers</b> for the Council in 1569, and expanded the number of councillors appreciably, at the same time replacing a few councillors (like the Burgundian Claude Belin), who had shown an undesirable degree of independence. The most important of the new members was the new secretary Jeronimo de Roda http://dutchrevolt.leidenuniv.nl/Nederlands/personen/r/roda.htm, who received the same powers as Vargas and Del Rio.|$|R
5000|$|Later in 1945, the Supreme Court of Yugoslavia {{was created}} with its seat in Belgrade. Judicial {{power on the}} {{territory}} of the People's Republic of Serbia was given to the [...] "people's courts": municipal courts, district courts and the Supreme People's Court with its seat in Belgrade. It functioned as both trial court and court of appeals. The Supreme Court of Serbia had a president, 14 judges and particular number of [...] "people's co-judges" [...] from common population. It had criminal and <b>civil</b> <b>chambers</b> and a disciplinary chamber. The Law proclaimed the courts to be free and independent from other branches of the government.|$|R
5000|$|Henry II {{established}} an audiencia to administer justice {{at the request}} of the Cortes of Toro, convened in 1371 by the king himself. The audiencia consisted of eight oidores (or jueces letrados, [...] "learned judges"), two prelates and the chancellors of justice, who were in charge of sealing documents. (Compare to the British Lord Chancellor.) John I of Castile applied the term chancillería (a court of last resort, not to be confused with a chancellery) in 1387 to these audiencias. By this time Valladolid Chancillería had come to consist of a governor (or regent), sixteen oidores (or [...] "civil-case judges"), three alcaldes del crimen, grouped into four <b>civil</b> <b>chambers,</b> one criminal and one for cases among hidalgos and nobles. The rulings of the Chacillería were irrevocable, although a very grave case could be reviewed by the Council of Castile.|$|R
50|$|Sociétié Plon et autres v.

Droit moral originated in France, this case serves to limit the scope of that right and expand the public domain in French copyright law.|$|E
50|$|Another {{specific}} is the non-responsibility of the parquet; a magistrate of the parquet {{is responsible}} only {{for his own}} mistakes but cannot be assigned court costs as another plaintiff might after losing a trial. He cannot be prosecuted for either injury or defamation caused by what {{he says in a}} hearing. Personal faults tied to public service can on the other hand be prosecuted by virtue of the State's power of recourse, but only in front of the <b>civil</b> <b>chamber</b> of the Cour de cassation.|$|E

50|$|After {{the end of}} the Second World War, Johanna Holländer {{filed suit}} - {{obviously}} from New York - on 20 May 1949 for compensation. In the case of the Castle Mill she sought to get it back and to be paid damages in the amount of DM100,000. Once she had come back to Wiesbaden, the embittered woman pursued the case doggedly and forcefully. When on 22 July 1954 the Fifth <b>Civil</b> <b>Chamber</b> of the Mainz Regional Court awarded her the Castle Mill and damages amounting to DM49,400 together with 4% interest since 20 May 1949, she launched an appeal.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{exceptional}} losses, regulation authorities accused the managers of grossly misinforming their stockholders. In January 2003, 270 minority stockholders decided to sue Kalisto Entertainment in order to obtain retributory damages, and the managers of Kalisto Entertainment were discharged. In addition, a civil procedure has also ensued against the Crédit Lyonnais bank. In the end, a decision was made by the Second <b>Civil</b> <b>Chamber</b> of the Appellate Court of Bordeaux on October 20, 2009, which permanently assessed the reasons of the losses of Kalisto Entertainment, and acquitted its managers of fault for the company’s losses.|$|E
50|$|In 1816 the Merchants' Guild {{issued the}} Second Exchange Ordinance {{with the support}} of the Senate. The {{commercial}} situation of the merchants was not very promising at the time, but it improved in the 1820s and very soon the Old Exchange was found to be inadequate. The Third Exchange Ordinance was published in 1849, which vested oversight of commerce with a Chamber of Commerce. From 1853, this Chamber received support from the newly founded Bremen Exchange Association (Bremer Börsenverein). Additionally, the building became home to the Upper Court, Lower Court, Commercial Court and <b>Civil</b> <b>Chamber</b> of the Bremen District Court.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of the soybean agribusiness complex in Brazil took place, in part, {{as a consequence of}} credit alternative forms, such as the soybean anticipated sale by contracts. The problems which have motivated this study were the contractual breaches during an expressive increase of price and their lawsuit decisions. Quantitative surveys have been carried out on 147 judicial decisions of Goiás State and with 70 farmers. The tests were done on decisions of first and second instance and a large dispersion of court decisions was found to the identical problem of contractual breaches. A significant difference was also proven between the second instance decisions of the four <b>Civil</b> <b>Chambers</b> of Goiás Court of Justice, however, most of decisions were favoring farmers. The effects of decisions can already be realized such as more requirements of warranties and the {{reduction in the number of}} contracts. Those soybean producers who did not breach their contracts also have been negatively affected by the strategic reactions of trading and processing companies. The use of the concept of “social role of contract” inserts a high degree of instability in contracts. Therefore, the transaction costs have been increased for all the agents and the importance of economic sanctions has increased as well...|$|R
