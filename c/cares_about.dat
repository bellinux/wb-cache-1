Seeing this, Stewie rushes upstairs to show Brian how much the Griffins still care about him, regardless of his species.

5|$|Nobody except Leslie really <b>cares</b> <b>about</b> the trip: Ron (Nick Offerman) {{just wants}} to fish, Ben (Adam Scott) failed to bring a tent, and Tom (Aziz Ansari) {{just wants to}} relax in his huge tent filled with luxury {{electronic}} items. Tom expresses confusion as to why Ben, a state auditor who had been helping with Pawnee's financial problems, has not returned to his old job at Indianapolis; Ben does not explain his reasons, but it is hinted he harbors romantic feelings for Leslie. Meanwhile, Andy (Chris Pratt) sets up a romantic tent for April (Aubrey Plaza) in the wrong campsite miles away, forcing him to trek through the wilderness to find everyone and leaving April miserable on the campsite without Andy. During brainstorming sessions, nobody produces any good ideas because they assume Leslie will think of one. However, she worriedly confides to Ann and Ben she cannot think of anything {{on the same level}} of the harvest festival.|$|E

5|$|Elsa, {{princess of}} Arendelle and heiress to the throne, is {{born with the}} ability to create and control ice and snow. As a child, she uses her {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland to play in with her younger sister and best friend, Princess Anna. One night, Elsa accidentally harms Anna with her powers. The king and queen of Arendelle hurriedly take Anna to a tribe of mountain trolls to be healed. While healing Anna, the trolls inform the royals present that Elsa's abilities will grow, becoming both beautiful and very dangerous so she must learn to control them. While the trolls erase Anna's memory of the incident and of her elder sister's powers in general, Elsa is traumatized by the event. The king and queen take steps to control and hide Elsa's ice powers: the castle gates are locked, Elsa is shut away in her bedroom for most of the time, she is given gloves to help suppress her powers and is told to hold in her emotions as well. Nonetheless her powers continue to grow even stronger and so she becomes fearful of harming those she <b>cares</b> <b>about</b> most. Meanwhile, her sister Anna is less happy and confused by the loss of contact with her elder sister and tries, without success, to coax her out of her room. When the sisters grow into teenagers, the ship in which the king and queen are sailing is capsized in a storm and they drown, leaving Anna and Elsa feeling even more lonely.|$|E
5|$|John Cena and Chris Jericho were {{involved}} in the main rivalry on the Raw brand over the World Heavyweight Championship. At WWE's November Survivor Series, Cena returned to the WWE after a legitimate neck injury (that he sustained at SummerSlam) and defeated Jericho to win the championship. On the November 24 episode of Raw, Jericho defeated Randy Orton and Batista in a Triple Threat match to earn a title match against Cena at Armageddon. Later that night, Chris Jericho attempted to steal Cena's thunder, claiming that he plans on winning back the title at Armageddon. When World Champion, John Cena could even make his much anticipated return to Raw, he then gave Jericho an opportunity to confront him face-to-face, Cena explained the difference between himself and Jericho, stating that he actually <b>cares</b> <b>about</b> the many members of the WWE Universe. After Jericho once again stated his intention to beat Cena at Armageddon and continued to belittle the WWE Universe, Cena snapped. He proceeded to brutalize Jericho, throwing him against the announce table, bludgeoning him with the steel stairs and locking him into an STFU. On the following week's episode of Raw, Jericho made his presence known {{in much the same way}} as Cena did the week before, addressing the audience as he made his way through the crowd down to the ring. The difference however, was that while Cena welcomed his fans, Jericho made pains to ignore them. He then went on to explain his resentment toward Cena, stating that while away from the WWE since August 2005, Jericho's son grew to be a fan, not of his father, but of John Cena. Now, Jericho hopes to show his son and all of the WWE what a real hero is, by beating Cena for the World Heavyweight Title at Armageddon. Later that night, Cena fought Kane in Raw's main event. Though Jericho attempted to become involved, Cena managed to fight off and then go on to defeat Kane. After the match, Cena chased Jericho, who was attempting to escape. The tables turned, however, when Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Manu emerged to attack Cena, allowing Jericho to lock Cena in the Walls of Jericho.|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} part has six chapters: End {{of life and}} dying, Palliate care, Home hospice multidisciplinary team, Specific of <b>care</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill patient in home background, Family and caregivers, Specifics of <b>care</b> <b>about</b> dying people in the CR. The second, practical part is based on qualitative-quantitative research with three goals. The first goal was to define the needs of family members <b>caring</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill person in domestic background. The second goal was to define the skills of nurses necessary for saturation {{of the needs of}} family members <b>caring</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill person in domestic background, and the last goal was to specify the present drawbacks of the care upon the research results. The following research questions were set in the qualitative part of the research: 1. What factors lead to decision of a family to participate in the <b>care</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill person in domestic background? 2. What factors prevent families from integration into the <b>care</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill person in domestic background? 3. What skills are necessary for a nurse in the process of family integration into the <b>care</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill client in home background? The research sample of the qualitative research consisted of six respondents having experience with <b>care</b> <b>about</b> a dying patient in domestic background. A semi structured interview consisting of six questions was the research method of this part of the thesis. The questions focused on the <b>care</b> <b>about</b> a dying family member in home background. The following hypotheses may be deduced from the research: 1. Giving information to lay caregivers before releasing a terminally ill client to domestic treatment within education contributes to their active involvement in the care. 2. Participation of a mobile hospice team in the <b>care</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill client in home background contributes to saturation of the needs of certainty and safety of the caregivers. The following hypotheses were set {{at the beginning of the}} quantitative research: 1. Respondent?s feeling of inability to participate in the care is an obstacle to the decision to start <b>caring</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill person in home background. 2. Fear of economic risk is an obstacle to the decision to start <b>caring</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill person in home background. 3. Utilization of professional services in the <b>care</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill person in home background depends on awareness of their existence and the extent of services being provided. The research sample consisted of 198 persons from the wide public. The data were collected by means of a questionnaire. The questionnaires examined the readiness of the respondents to decide to start <b>caring</b> <b>about</b> a terminally ill person in home background and their awareness of the existence of institutions providing palliative care in home background. The first two hypotheses were confirmed by the results of the questionnaire research, the third one was not confirmed.

40|$|In an {{important}} paper, Fuhrer and Moore (1995) showed that Taylor (1980) ’s staggered wage setting model does not exhibit persistence in inflation; they proposed a simple modification, in which workers <b>cared</b> <b>about</b> the real wages of other workers, which solves this problem. However, {{we argue that}} the key part of Fuhrer and Moore’s model is not that workers <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the real wages of other workers, but that workers are assumed to <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the past real wages of other workers. When that assumption is replaced by the assumption that workers <b>care</b> <b>about</b> current real wages of other workers, the Fuhrer and Moore model reverts identically to the Taylor model. We also show that a simple model in which workers <b>care</b> <b>about</b> their own past real wages, e. g. because unemployment insurance depends on past wages, as noted in Blanchard and Katz (1999), generates negative autocorrelations in inflation...|$|R
