This stops them from reaching the intake and causing the issues mentioned above.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this data {{collection}} activity is to obtain data for a screening of combustible gases in <b>catch</b> <b>tanks</b> that are currently operated by the River Protection Project (RPP). The results {{will be used to}} support closure of the flammable gas unreviewed safety question for these facilities. The data collection will be conducted in accordance with the ''Tank Safety Screening Data Quality Objective'' (Dukelow et a 1 1995). Combustible gas, ammonia, and organic vapor levels in the headspace of the <b>catch</b> <b>tanks</b> will be field-measured using hand-held instruments. If a combustible gas level measurement in a tank exceeds an established threshold, vapor grab samples will be collected for laboratory analysis. In addition, ventilation rates of some <b>catch</b> <b>tanks</b> will be determined using the tracer gas injection method to evaluate removal of flammable gas by air flowing through the tanks.

50|$|Another {{issue that}} has been raised as a {{possible}} problem with allowing oil vapor into the intake is the chance of pre-detonation (Knock) caused by the oil vapor exploding during the compression cycle of the engine. This has become more of an issue {{as more and more}} cars have started to run high boost levels and high compression ratios. The higher the compression and boost the more likely the oil is to start to burn (Pre-Detonate)Fitting an oil <b>catch</b> <b>tank</b> (can) in the breather pipe will stop the oil vapors from reaching the combustion chamber.

50|$|A leaking {{head gasket}} can be {{classified}} as either external or internal. An external leak can be identified as oil and coolant accumulating underneath the engine. The presence of coolant can be detected by shining a black light on {{what appears to be}} an oil leak; the appearance of coolant will show up under the black light. External leaks can also appear as previously described in the oil. An internal leak can usually be diagnosed by excessive coolant accumulating in the expansion tank along with the presence of hydrocarbons in the form of foam. The possibility of vapors or condensation and/or water (from the road or rain) building up (in aftermarket product installation) from an external breather or <b>catch</b> <b>tank</b> from the head (rocker cover) can also cause a buildup of froth or foam in the oil but is highly unlikely.|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy&#x 27;s (DOE) Hanford Site is {{responsible}} for the safe storage, retrieval, treatment, and disposal of approximately 54 million gallons (204 million liters) of radioactive waste generated since the site&#x 27;s inception in 1943. Today, the major structures involved in waste management at Hanford include 149 carbon steel single-shell tanks, 28 carbon-steel double-shell tanks, plus a network of buried metallic transfer lines and ancillary systems (pits, vaults, <b>catch</b> <b>tanks,</b> etc.) required to store, retrieve, and transfer waste within the tank farm system. Many of the waste management systems at Hanford are still in use today. In response to uncertainties regarding the structural integrity of these systems,&#x 27; an independent, comprehensive integrity assessment of the Hanford Site piping system was performed. It was found that regulators do not require the cathodically protected pipelines located within the Hanford Site to be assessed by External Corrosion Direct Assessment (ECDA) or any other method used to ensure integrity. However, a case study is presented discussing the application of the direct assessment process on pipelines in such a nuclear environment. Assessment methodology and assessment results are contained herein.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is twofold. First, this report {{documents}} the technical evaluation supporting the Project Hanford Management Contract (PHMC) contractor recommendation to close the Unreviewed Safety Question (USQ) as originally evaluated in TF- 94 - 0260, Soil Compaction Test Data Indicates Soil Density in Excess of Density Used in Tank Qualification Analysis for AP Tank Farm. Second, this report describes the status of existing structural analyses for the Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS) waste storage structures and outlines the associated technical upgrades being considered by the contractor. This second feature of the report serves to communicate {{the distinction between the}} soil density issue which is the topic of the open USQ and other technical issues which are important to the contractor from a programmatic standpoint. Contractor actions to address the latter technical issues would support improvements in day-to-day operations (e. g., provide possible relaxations in soil load restrictions) but are not necessary to close the soil density USQ. Section 2. 0 of this report documents the rationale for the PHMC contractor recommendation to the Department of Energy (DOE) to close the soil density USQ. Section 3. 0 documents the recommended structural analyses improvements for the double-shell tanks (DSTs) which are the structures associated with the soil density USQ. Sections 4. 0 and 5. 0 provide, for completeness, the same information for single-shell tanks (SSTs), double-contained receiver <b>tanks</b> (DCRTs), <b>catch</b> <b>tanks</b> and inactive miscellaneous underground storage tanks (IMUSTs).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this status report is to {{summarize}} updated data and information from the FY 1994 strategy plan {{that is associated with}} inactive miscellaneous underground storage tanks (IMUSTs). Assumptions and processes to assess potential risks and operational concerns are documented in this report. Safety issue priorities are ranked based on a number of considerations. Sixty-three IMUSTs have been Identified and placed on the official IMUST list. All the tanks are associated with past Hanford Site operations. Of the 63 <b>tanks.,</b> 19 are <b>catch</b> <b>tanks,</b> 20 are vault tanks, 3 are neutralization tanks, 8 are settling tanks, 2 are solvent makeup tanks used to store hexone, 2 are flush tanks, 3 are decontamination tanks, 1 is a diverter station, 1 is a receiver tank, 1 is an experimental tank, and 3 are waste handling tanks. It is important to proactively deal with the risks Imposed by these 63 tanks, {{and at the same time}} not jeopardize the existing commitments and schedules for mitigating and resolving identified safety issues related to the 177 SSTs and DSTS. Access controls and signs have been placed on all but the three official IMUSTs added most recently.

40|$|The empovrishment of {{the soil}} brought about by erosion and {{cultivation}} of cotton has been studied in experimental plots where <b>catch</b> <b>tanks</b> were employed to collect soil removed by erosion. These tests {{have been carried out}} by the Soil Conservation Department at the Experiment Station of the Instituto Agronômico of Campinas, in Pindorama, and on the "Arenito Bauru" soil type representative of the region. Actually sixty percent of all coffee and eighty percent of all cotton cultivation in the State of São Paulo is on the "Arenito Bauru" soil type. Thus the data collected, although preliminary, are of great interest, and indicate that the empovrishment of the "Arenito Bauru" soil by erosion is extremely rapid. It is also pointed out that the "Arenito Bauru" soils are the most highly erodable of all soil types in the State of São Paulo. A chemical analysis was made of representative samples of the original soils in the experimental plots and of samples of soil carried in the runoff, for the purpose of determining the losses due to erosion. It has been determined that the soil transported in the runoff is proportionally very much richer in mineral elements than was the original soil. The data obtained from analysis of samples showed that soil eroded from the experimental plots contained 2. 0 times as much organic material, 2. 8 times as much P 2 O 5; 2. 3 times as much K 2 O, and 1. 9 times as much CaO, as was determined present in the samples obtained from the original soil of the experimental plots. In the runoff water it has determined that calcium was present in larger quantities than other elements. On the basis of data obtained from the experimental plots with cotton cultivation, an evaluation and comparison was made of the amount of mineral elements lost by erosion and the amount used by the cotton crop. It was found that the empovrishment {{of the soil}} by loss of organic material and chemical elements was due more to erosion than to utilization of these in the production of harvested cotton. A discussion is given of forms of organic and mineral fertilizers to be employed on "Arenito Bauru" soils, taking into consideration the physical and chemical nature of these soils...|$|R
