40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we intend to}} {{continue}} {{the analysis of the}} river international contract of carriage of goods on the Danube, in general, and, in particular, to analyze the causes for exoneration from the <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> the Danubian carrier. Objectives: The main objective is to argue how, in the event <b>of</b> damage <b>caused</b> during transport, the carrier is presumed to be at fault, as an effect of triggering the presumption <b>of</b> <b>liability,</b> it may rebut the presumption of juris tantum by contrary evidence, proving that the real <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the prejudice is not imputable. Prior Work: In the context where also the Romanian and European doctrine analyzes these causes, this paper aims at examining in detail and comparatively their impact, analyzing the legal texts, and also their impact during the trial. Approach: We will consider the exemption circumstances, based on the interpretation of international regulation of the contract of carriage of goods by inland waterways, which we will report in detail. Results: By comparing the two international conventions, we will demonstrate that these <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> removal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> have a predetermined scope, {{in the sense that they}} affect both contractual relations and in tort <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> the carrier.

40|$|The author {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between the two fundamental theories about liability for non performance in the Italian civil code. Both Osti and Mengoni conceive this liability as one which, contrary to what often is said in literature, is based, not on negligence, but on no-performance itself according to what precisely art. 1218 of the Italian civil code of 1942 establishes. The specific question is the difference between the two authors. First of all Osti writes with reference to the Italian civil code of 1865, whereas Mengoni refers to the new one of 1942, which indeed adopted the solution suggested by Osti under the previous one. Secondly the idea <b>of</b> a contractual <b>liability</b> detached from negligence by Mengoni finds its foundation on the theory that every obligation has a result. Therefore the unified rule on liability is the natural outcome of a unified theory of obligation, which overcomes the false distinction between obligations de moyens and obligations de résultat. Specific attention Mengoni dedicates also to restitution at the end of a contractual relationship. Diverging from Osti, Mengoni affirms that this obligation is a contractual one, not an ex lege obligation founded on unjustified enrichment. With regard to the impossibility as a <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> exclusion <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> when it is not accountable to the debtor, the difference is that whereas Osti still holds an absolute and naturalistic idea, Mengoni accepts the suggestion of identifying it with the Unerschwingbarkeit theorized by Savigny and corresponding to a relative impossibility...|$|R

40|$|Duty of care {{cannot be}} used anymore as the touchstone to {{differentiate}} negligence from strict liability, because the scope <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> (traditionally called proximate causation) requirement replicates many of the former features. Indeed, under a negligence rule the marginal Hand formula is applied twice: first to assess whether the defendant did breach his or her duty of care, and, second, to delimit whether defendant's behavior was a proximate <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the harm suffered by the victim. But under a strict liability rule, the Hand formula question is applied only once when the proximate causation question is raised. Traditional law and economics analysis has almost always taken normative questions raised by the causation requirement as given, which is a major flaw of mainstream models, because {{the centrality of the}} scope <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> or proximate causation requirement in real legal practice is disregarded if not simply expelled from the analysis.

Limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses are common in business contracts, especially in construction, a field that includes many professionals such as engineers and architects. While Florida has historically enforced limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses in professional services contracts, recent cases have cast doubt on whether the clauses are enforceable. If the Florida Supreme Court establishes that professionals cannot rely upon these clauses, it will be taking a position contrary to the majority of states, including New York, California, and Texas, all of which enforce limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses with varying degrees of restriction. This Note argues that Florida should not prohibit professionals from using limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses. These clauses do not violate public policy when, as already required by Florida law, the clauses are stated clearly, ensuring that both parties to the contract are aware of their existence.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} how {{the absence of}} insurance in the past led to some special maritime liability law principles such as 'general average' (i. e., losses or expenses shared by all the parties to a maritime adventure) and the limitation <b>of</b> shipowners' <b>liability.</b> In the absence of insurance, these principles served the function of insurance mostly for shipowners. As commercial marine insurance is now widely available, these principles have lost their justification and may in fact interfere with the most important goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law i. e., deterrence from negligence. The thesis thus recommends their abolition. The thesis further argues that when insurance is easily available and affordable to the both parties to a liability claim, the main goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law should be deterrence as opposed to compensation. This is exactly {{the case with the}} maritime cargo liability claims where both cargo owners and shipowners are invariably insured. As a result, the sole focus <b>of</b> cargo <b>liability</b> law should be and, to a great extent, is deterrence. On the other hand, in the vessel-source oil pollution liability setting, pollution victims are not usually insured. Therefore, oil pollution liability law has to cater both for compensation and deterrence, the two traditional goals <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law. The final question the thesis addresses is whether the deterrent effect <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law is affected by the availability <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance.

40|$|Negligence is not {{a ground}} <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> unless it <b>causes</b> injury or damage to some {{interest}} which the law recognizes and protects. Moreover, {{it does not make}} a defendant liable for any injury or damage that {{is not a}} consequence of the negligence. The establishment of the requisite causal connection is therefore an element of a plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> action for negligence, to be pleaded and proven by him. And where a <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> action exists, the question of causal connection will determine the scope <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> [...] the extent of the injury or damage for which defendant will have to pay. The question then naturally arises what is the kind of causal connection or relationship that the law requires to be proven. Obviously the legal test includes a requirement that the wrongful conduct must be a <b>cause</b> in fact <b>of</b> the harm; but if this stood alone the scope <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> would be vast indeed, for 2 ̆ 2 the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> [are] infinite 2 ̆ 7 [...] - 2 ̆ 2 the fatal trespass done by Eve was <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> all our woe. 2 ̆ 2 But the law has not stopped there [...] it has developed further restrictions and limitations.
