5|$|As the Allied armies {{advanced}} into Germany in April 1945, Alsos Mission teams searched Stadtilm, {{where they}} found documentation concerning the German nuclear program, components of a nuclear reactor, and eight tons of uranium oxide. Scientists captured at Göttingen and Katlenburg-Lindau included Werner Osenberg, {{the chief of the}} planning board of the Reichsforschungsrat, and Fritz Houtermans, who provided information about the Soviet atomic bomb project. At Celle, the Alsos Mission uncovered an experimental <b>centrifuge</b> for separating uranium isotopes, the result of work undertaken at the University of Hamburg by a team under Paul Harteck.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Reticulated porous {{ceramics}} (RPCs) with uniform structure were fabricated by a two-step <b>centrifuging</b> process. The two-step <b>centrifuging</b> process {{includes two}} <b>centrifuging</b> steps. In the first stage, the polyurethane sponges are coated with thin slurry through high speed <b>centrifuging</b> process. In the second stage, the as-prepared dried green body was recoated with thixotropic slurry through <b>centrifuging</b> process with an appropriate <b>centrifuging</b> speed. According to the results, the RPCs with controlled structure can be fabricated by modulating the rotation speed {{in the second}} <b>centrifuging</b> process...|$|R

5|$|Karl P. Cohen(1913–2012) was an American chemist {{that worked}} as a {{research}} assistant {{under the direction of}} Harold Urey. Cohen’s greatest accomplishment was his work with Urey at Columbia, where he helped to perfect the enrichment techniques used in the Manhattan Project. He was {{a major player in the}} development of the <b>centrifuge</b> isotope separation, which is now the most commonly used way of uranium enrichment.He became an advisor for Standard Oil and worked towards the possibility of the nuclear energy. Cohen later started his work with General Electric Company and created the Reactor Safety Committee there.|$|E
5|$|Actinides easily {{react with}} halogens forming salts with the {{formulas}} MX3 and MX4 (X = halogen). So the first berkelium compound, BkCl3, was synthesized in 1962 with {{an amount of}} 3 nanograms. Like the halogens of rare earth elements, actinide chlorides, bromides, and iodides are water-soluble, and fluorides are insoluble. Uranium easily yields a colorless hexafluoride, which sublimates at a temperature of 56.5°C; because of its volatility, it {{is used in the}} separation of uranium isotopes with gas <b>centrifuge</b> or gaseous diffusion. Actinide hexafluorides have properties close to anhydrides. They are very sensitive to moisture and hydrolyze forming AnO2F2. The pentachloride and black hexachloride of uranium were synthesized, but they are both unstable.|$|E
5|$|The {{biggest problem}} {{faced by the}} MAUD Committee {{was to find a}} way to {{separate}} the 0.7% of uranium-235 from the 99.3% of uranium-238. This is difficult because the two types of uranium are chemically identical. Separation (uranium enrichment) would have to be achieved at a large scale. At Cambridge, Eric Rideal and his team investigated using a gas <b>centrifuge.</b> Frisch chose to perform gaseous thermal diffusion using Clusius tubes because it seemed the simplest method. Frisch's calculations showed there would need to be 100,000 Clusius tubes to extract the desired separation amount. Peierls turned to Franz Simon, who preferred to find a method more suitable for mass production.|$|E

5|$|The <b>centrifuge</b> {{process was}} {{regarded}} as the only promising separation method in April 1942. Jesse Beams had developed such a process at the University of Virginia during the 1930s, but had encountered technical difficulties. The process required high rotational speeds, but at certain speeds harmonic vibrations developed that threatened to tear the machinery apart. It was therefore necessary to accelerate quickly through these speeds. In 1941 he began working with uranium hexafluoride, the only known gaseous compound of uranium, {{and was able to}} separate uranium-235. At Columbia, Urey had Karl Cohen investigate the process, and he produced a body of mathematical theory making it possible to design a centrifugal separation unit, which Westinghouse undertook to construct.|$|E

5|$|The sugar may {{be transported}} in bulk {{to the country}} {{where it will be}} used and the {{refining}} process often takes place there. The first stage is known as affination and involves immersing the sugar crystals in a concentrated syrup that softens and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them. The crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water. The resulting syrup is treated either by a carbonatation or by a phosphatation process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the syrup and when this is filtered out, many of the impurities are removed at the same time. Removal of color is achieved by using either a granular activated carbon or an ion-exchange resin. The sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out. The liquor is spun off in a <b>centrifuge</b> and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus liquor is made into refiners' molasses.|$|E

The <b>centrifuged</b> supernatant liquid was collected and then <b>centrifuged</b> twice at 10, 000  rpm for 30  min. The suspended pellet was purified using ethanol [13]. The purified pellets were then dried and the powder was taken which is used for further characterization.|$|R

5|$|While Glenn {{was on duty}} at Patuxent and in Washington, he read {{everything}} he could find about space. His office was asked to send a test pilot to Langley Air Force Base in Virginia to make runs on a spaceflight simulator, as part of research by the newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) into re-entry vehicle shapes. The pilot would also {{be sent to the}} Naval Air Development Center in Johnsville, Pennsylvania, and would be subjected to high g-forces in a <b>centrifuge</b> for comparison with data collected in the simulator. His request for the position was granted, and he spent several days at Langley and a week in Johnsville for the testing. NASA asked military-service members to participate in planning the mockup of a spacecraft. Since he had participated in the research at Langley and Johnsville, he was sent to the McDonnell plant in St. Louis as a service adviser to NASA's spacecraft mockup board.|$|E
5|$|In a {{flashback}} scene, Nico explores an old facility in Phoenix, {{where she is}} confronted by Spallaci's men, but is saved by Maynard. However, Maynard dies after he gets locked in the <b>centrifuge,</b> and Nico manages to escape by tricking Spallaci's men. Back in Rome, Nico informs George that the monatomic gold {{is being used to}} build a weapon called the Ark. They return to the monastery and witness Father Gregor shoot Gianelli; Nico is taken away and George is knocked out. When he awakens, the dying Gianelli hands over a manuscript in Latin, and tells him that the Ark's purpose is to use the monatomic gold to destroy the unbelievers. George goes to rescue Nico and meets Anna Maria in the catacombs, who tells him her side of the story and that the Ark needs a human interface to be activated. George arrives at the ceremony to see Nico chained to the Ark, ready to become the new Angel of Death. Mevlut, who is in fact ex-Turkish security and only pretended to be a waiter and priest, enters the scene armed with a gun, but Anna Maria points her gun at him as well. George succeeds in stopping the ceremony in time and frees Nico, but Anna Maria and Mevlut shoot each other and die.|$|E
25|$|The Zippe <b>centrifuge</b> is an {{improvement}} {{on the standard}} gas <b>centrifuge,</b> the primary difference being the use of heat.

25|$|A November 2013 {{article in}} Foreign Policy {{magazine}} claims {{existence of an}} earlier, much more sophisticated attack on the <b>centrifuge</b> complex at Natanz, focused on increasing <b>centrifuge</b> failure rate over a long time period by stealthily inducing uranium hexafluoride gas overpressure incidents.
