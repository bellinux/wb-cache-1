25|$|Because a hijri or Islamic lunar year {{is between}} 10 and 12 days shorter than a <b>civil</b> <b>year,</b> it begins 10–12 days {{earlier in the}} <b>civil</b> <b>year</b> {{following}} the <b>civil</b> <b>year</b> in which the previous hijri year began. Once every 33 or 34 hijri years, or once every 32 or 33 civil years, {{the beginning of a}} hijri year (1 Muharram) coincides with one of the first ten days of January.

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Rome's legendary 10-month calendar notionally {{lasted for}} 304 days but was usually thought {{to make up}} the rest of the solar year during an unorganized winter period.

The Julian year was 365 days long, with a leap day doubled in length every fourth year, almost equivalent to the present Gregorian system.|$|E

25|$|The Alexandrine monk Panodorus {{reckoned}} 5904 {{years from}} Adam {{to the year}} AD 412. His years began with August 29, corresponding to the First of Thoth, the Egyptian new year.Annianos of Alexandria however, preferred the Annunciation style as New Year's Day, 25 March, and shifted the Panodorus era by about six months, to begin on 25 March. This created the Alexandrian Era, whose first day {{was the first day}} of the proleptic Alexandrian <b>civil</b> <b>year</b> in progress, 29 August 5493 BC, with the ecclesiastical year beginning on 25 March 5493 BC.|$|E
25|$|The Coptic {{year is the}} {{extension}} of the ancient Egyptian <b>civil</b> <b>year,</b> retaining its subdivision into the three seasons, four months each. The three seasons are commemorated by special prayers in the Coptic Liturgy. This calendar is still in use all over Egypt by farmers {{to keep track of the}} various agricultural seasons. The Coptic calendar has 13 months, 12 of 30 days each and an intercalary month at the end of the year of 5 or 6 days, depending whether the year is a leap year or not. The year starts on 29 August in the Julian Calendar or on the 30th in the year before (Julian) Leap Years. The Coptic Leap Year follows the same rules as the Julian Calendar so that the extra month always has six days in the year before a Julian Leap Year.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of their assumptions, these {{scholars}} believe that the original ceremony was simply the ritual purification of the sanctuary from any accidental ritual impurity, at the start of each new year, as seen in the Book of Ezekiel. Textual scholars date this original ceremony to before the priestly source, but after JE. According to the Book of Ezekiel, the sanctuary was to be cleansed by the sprinkling of bullock's blood, {{on the first day of}} the first and of the seventh months — near the start of the <b>civil</b> <b>year</b> and of the ecclesiastical year, respectively; although the masoretic text of the Book of Ezekiel has the second of these cleansings on the seventh of the first month, biblical scholars regard the Septuagint, which has the second cleaning as being the first of the seventh month, as being more accurate here. It appears that during the period that the Holiness Code and the Book of Ezekiel were written, the new year began on the tenth day of the seventh month, and thus liberal biblical scholars believe that by the time the Priestly Code was compiled, the date of the new year and of the day of atonement had swapped around.|$|E
