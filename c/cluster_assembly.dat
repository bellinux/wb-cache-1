The strong host dependence is illustrated by the lack of genes for some biosynthetic pathways and for the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

40|$|The biogenesis of iron–sulphur {{clusters}} {{requires the}} co-ordinated delivery of both iron and sulphur. It {{is now clear}} that sulphur in iron–sulphur clusters is derived from L-cysteine by cysteine desulphurases. However, the iron donor for the iron–sulphur <b>cluster</b> <b>assembly</b> still remains elusive. Our previous studies indicated that Escherichia coli IscA, a member of the iron–sulphur <b>cluster</b> <b>assembly</b> machinery, is an iron-binding protein that can provide iron for the iron–sulphur <b>cluster</b> <b>assembly</b> in a proposed scaffold IscU. To determine how the iron centre in IscA is transferred for the iron–sulphur <b>cluster</b> <b>assembly</b> in IscU, we explore the mobility of the iron centre in IscA. The UV–visible and EPR measurements show that L-cysteine, but not IscU, is able to mobilize the iron centre in IscA and make the iron available for the iron–sulphur <b>cluster</b> <b>assembly</b> in IscU. Other related biological thiols such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine or reduced glutathione have no effect on the iron centre of IscA, suggesting that L-cysteine is unique in mobilizing the iron centre of IscA. Nevertheless, L-cysteine alone is not sufficient to transfer the iron from IscA to IscU. Both L-cysteine and cysteine desulphurase (IscS) are required for the IscA-mediated assembly of iron–sulphur clusters in IscU. The results suggest that L-cysteine may have two distinct functions in the biogenesis of iron–sulphur clusters: to mobilize the iron centre in IscA and to provide sulphur via cysteine desulphurase (IscS) for the iron–sulphur <b>cluster</b> <b>assembly</b> in IscU...|$|E

In the SEM images, a random stacking of the Fe clusters and a porous structure with a low cluster packing fraction of about 25 % are observed. For the Fe <b>cluster</b> <b>assemblies,</b> magnetic coercivity (Hc) at room temperature increases from 4 × 101 to 4 × 102 Oe by increasing the mean cluster size from 7. 3 to 16. 3 nm. Using the experimental values of the coercivity at T? 100 K and the fitting values of blocking temperature TB from Hc=Hc 0 [1 -(T/TB) 1 / 2], we estimated the values of magnetic anisotropy constant K {{of the order of}} 106 erg/cm 3 from TB=KV/ 25 kB, which is larger by an order of magnitude than the bulk Fe value (5 × 105 erg/cm 3). Such a large effective anisotropy at T? 100 K is ascribed to the large surface anisotropy effects of the small clusters and the low cluster-packing fraction of the Fe <b>cluster</b> <b>assemblies.</b> For the oxide-coated Fe cluster samples, the coercivity strongly depends on the oxygen gas flow rate during deposition, cluster size, and temperature.

For R-O 2 0. 3 SCCM, tunnel-type temperature dependence of sigma {{in the form}} of In sigma vs 1 /T was observed between 7 and 80 K. This differs from the well-known temperature dependence of In sigma vs 1 /T- 1 / 2 for disordered granular materials.

This marked increase, by a factor of 6 is much larger than those observed for conventional metal-insulator granular systems.

40|$|IscR (iron-sulfur cluster regulator) is encoded by an ORF located {{immediately}} upstream {{of genes}} coding for the Escherichia coli Fe-S <b>cluster</b> <b>assembly</b> proteins, IscS, IscU, and IscA. IscR shares amino acid similarity with MarA, {{a member of}} the MarA/SoxS/Rob family of transcription factors. In this study, we found that IscR functions as a repressor of the iscRSUA operon, because strains deleted for iscR have increased expression of this operon. In addition, in vitro transcription reactions established a direct role for IscR in repression of the iscR promoter. Analysis of IscR by electron paramagnetic resonance showed that the anaerobically isolated protein contains a [2 Fe- 2 S] 1 + cluster. The Fe-S cluster appears to be important for IscR function, because repression of iscR expression is significantly reduced in strains containing null mutations of the Fe-S <b>cluster</b> <b>assembly</b> genes iscS or hscA.
