For now, {{it is not}} known whether gender differences in pedestrian behaviors only concern rule compliance. The objective {{of this study was to}} explore gender differences in pedestrian rule compliance and in gaze targets before and during crossing. 400 adult pedestrians were observed at two signalized and two unsignalized crossroads, using a taxonomic observation grid which detailed 13 behavioral categories before, during and after crossing. The results show that the temporal <b>crossing</b> <b>compliance</b> rate is lower among male pedestrians but spatial <b>crossing</b> <b>compliance</b> does not differ between genders. Furthermore, different gaze patterns emerge between genders before and during crossing, notably as women particularly focus on other pedestrians during these two periods whereas men focus on vehicles.

The pedestrian crossing movements were captured throughvideographic survey conducted at selected 8 signalized intersections in Mumbai, India The captured data consisting of around 2476 pedestrians and {{observed that the}} rate of pedestrian compliance with traffic signal was 53 %. This study is oriented towards various levels of pedestrian crossing behaviour such as pedestrian arrival pattern, <b>crossing</b> speed, <b>compliance</b> behaviour and pedestrian-vehicular interaction at signalized intersections. In first level, the pedestrian arrival pattern was analysed to find best fit. In second level, the factors affecting pedestrian crossing speed were identified by suitable statistical test with respect to pedestrian and traffic characteristics.

This paper considers the role of VIP compliance testing for core- and chip-level verification of PCI Express-based designs to ensure robust device-level and interface compliance. With the major revision of PCI Express 2. 0 (Gen- 2) specification, compliance verification to Gen- 2 features and to cross mode interoperability becomes critically important in chip and system development. Overview For a PCI Express product to be successful, it must be compliant to the standard specification published by PCI Special Interest Group (PCI-SIG) {{and be able to}} inter-operate with designs from different vendors. PCI-SIG provides a Compliance Program to validate a design to a certain level of specification compliance. Devices that fail compliance testing can be costly to the product introduction with delays in time to market. To insure a higher chance of success in compliance and interoperability, users can verify their design early during the design phase by using verification IP with robust compliance test suites. The PCI Express Base Specification Revision 2. 0 (Gen- 2) specification [1] is a major revision most notably an updated LTSSM for speed negotiation and lane reconfiguration. The number of PCI-SIG Compliance checklist items has also increased significantly with approximately 1000 new items from 1. 0 a to 1. 1 revisions and perhaps several hundred more in 2. 0.

40|$|IntroductionKawasaki {{disease is}} the leading cause of {{acquired}} heart disease in children. Increased cardiovascular risk can be assessed by intima-media thickness (IMT), a strong independent predictive factor for coronary heart disease, as could be the flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD). However, controversy exists about these parameters if altered in children with Kawasaki disease. ObjectiveThe aim of our study was to study the mechanical arterial properties and to analyze endothelial function by measuring the flow-mediated dilatation proving its alteration in Kawasaki disease patients evolving with moderate or without coronary artery lesions. Population and methodsA study design of 29 patients who had Kawasaki disease with no or transient or coronary artery involvement less than 4 mm of dilatation (group I), mean age 7, 6 years, was compared to 30 healthy age-matched children (group II), mean age of 8, 3 years. The carotid IMT, incremental elastic modulus, <b>cross</b> sectional <b>compliance,</b> distensibility and FMD were determined non-invasively one year following the disease. ResultsNo significant difference was found with Flow-Mediated Dilatation between either group, for group I (9, 16 %, Standard Deviation: SD= 5, 05) and group II (8, 8 %, SD= 4, 56). As it was for mechanical arterial properties, like incremental elastic modulus, vascular compliance, distensibility and IMT, for group I (Mean IMT= 0, 44 mm, SD= 0, 028) vs (0, 46 mm, SD= 0, 060) for group II. ConclusionsEarly evaluation of mechanical properties and endothelial function of the arteries in patients with Kawasaki disease, who have no or little dilatation less than 4 mm in coronary arteries, don’t show any alteration as compared with healthy population. However, this non-invasive test could be performed to a larger population of Kawasaki patients described above, in a prospective study with repeated measurements and follow up at different ages to confirm the absence of cardiovascular risk...|$|R

It does so by outlining the premises of decision-making and the range of policy problems that <b>cross</b> <b>compliance</b> was perceived to address in the agricultural sector. The discourse approach highlights the critical importance of agenda setting in policy design, an area that has received little attention in literature on environmental policy integration. The analysis reveals that instead of conforming to a single dominant policy agenda which raises the status of environmental protection requirements, a number of conflicting agendas have influenced the design of the new mechanism. The results show how persisting agrarian as well as market oriented aspirations ride the wave created by pressure to green the sector.

The SARTRE- 4 survey, co-funded by the European Commission, was conducted in 19 European countries, namely 18 EU Member States (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden) and Israel. A total sample of 1, 000 road users was interviewed in each country, using a common questionnaire, with questions on road safety attitudes, perceptions, beliefs, motives etc. The questionnaire was designed with the same structure and methodology as in the previous SARTRE surveys, so that trends over time could be monitored. However, unlike the previous SARTRE surveys, which were devoted exclusively to drivers of passenger cars, the SARTRE- 4 survey has been extended to other road users, namely motorcyclists, pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users. In this paper, the responses of pedestrians with respect to their road safety attitudes and perceptions are analyzed, including the perceived risk of walking compared to other transport modes, the perceived risk of speeding vehicles, alcohol, distraction and fatigue, the acceptance of enforcement and penalties, as well as of dedicated safety measures for pedestrians (e. g. 30 km/h-zones, sidewalks and crosswalks). Moreover, additional questions specific to pedestrians are analyzed, concerning their motivations for not using a car or a motorcycle, their travel habits and behaviours (e. g. road <b>crossing</b> behaviour, <b>compliance,</b> distractions {{such as the use of}} mobile phone), their perceived level of service (e. g. safety, security, facilities available) and their interactions with other road users.

Survival analysis suggested that the greatest drop in the cumulative probability of having a non-compliant gap occurred early in treatment for both classes. No differences were found in the comparisons of the tricyclics and the SSRI's in terms of non-compliance. The predictor variable age was weakly associated with noncompliance; as age increased, non-compliance decreased. In addition, regimen complexity as measured by the number of concurrent medications and the number at doses per day was also weakly associated with non-compliance. More specifically, as the number of concurrent medications increased, compliance increased and as the number of doses per day increased, compliance decreased. [...] A number of problems were identified with the Blue Cross Database. In a number of cases, data was missing. Data contamination problems were identified that were probably the result of data entry errors. Cleaning protocols were developed to deal with some of these problems. A number of other problems were also identified which were inherent to the database. For example, {{there was a lack of}} documentation concerning dates of entry and exit to the Blue Cross Program...|$|R
