50|$|High heating {{efficiencies}} on <b>closed</b> <b>appliances</b> {{can only}} be attained by controlling the supply of air to the fire chamber (operating the air control correctly). It is not recommended to leave the air control fully open, except when helping the chimney/flue heat up initially. A fully open air control {{will lead to more}} heat being sent straight up the chimney rather than into the room (which reduces efficiency). The biggest problem with leaving the air control fully open is “overfiring”. Overfiring is caused when too much heat is generated within the fire chamber, which will lead to warping, buckling and general damage to the stove and its internal components. Individual stoves will have their own quirks, so it is necessary to learn each new stove's settings.|$|R
40|$|The Network Function Virtualization (NFV) {{paradigm}} {{proposes to}} transform those network functions today running on dedicated and often <b>closed</b> <b>appliances</b> (e. g., firewall, wan accelerator) into pure software images, called Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), {{which can be}} consolidated and executed on high-volume standard servers. In this context, this dissertation focuses {{on the possibility of}} enabling each single end user (and not only network operators) to set up network services by means of NFV, allowing him to custoimize the set of services that are active on his Internet connection. This goal mainly requires to address flexibility and performance issues. Regarding to the former, it is important: (i) to support services including both network (e. g., firewall) and cloud (e. g., storage server) applications; (ii) to allow the user to define the service with an intuitive and high-level abstraction, hiding infrastructure-layer details. Instead, with respect to performance, multiple software-based services operating on the user's traffic should not introduce penalties in the user's Internet experience. This dissertation solves the above issues by proposing a number of improvements in the context of Network Function Virtualization, both in terms of high level models and architectures to define and instantiate network services, and in terms of mechanisms to efficiently interconnect VNFs. Experimental results demonstrate that the goal of allowing end users to deploy services operating on their own traffic is feasible without impacting the Internet experienc...|$|R

As appliances are operated, their change of position opens some circuits that lock out other appliances that would conflict with the new position. Similarly, other circuits are <b>closed</b> when the <b>appliances</b> they control become safe to operate.

A third opened on the Navan Road in September 2010. A fourth store opened in the Ilac Centre in Dublin in November 2010. There are now ten Iceland stores in Ireland.In January 2009, Iceland {{announced that it would}} buy 51 stores in the UK from the failed Woolworths Group chain, three days after the final 200 Woolworths stores closed their doors for the last time. In April 2009, Iceland announced plans to <b>close</b> its <b>appliance</b> showrooms by September 2009 to concentrate on food retailing. Iceland's sales for the year ended 27 March 2009 were £2.08 billion, a 16% increase on the previous year, with net profits of £113.7 million.

This case report describes the orthodontic therapy applied to a 7 -year- 9 -month old child, who presented a Class II, division 1 malocclusion associated to skeletal open bite. Functional and skeletal corrections (sagittally and vertically) were obtained by means of mandible advancement achieved with a <b>closed</b> Balter’s bionator <b>appliance</b> followed by a fixed appliance. This approach showed to be efficient in accomplishing both functional and aesthetic goals, that were kept stable {{five years after the}} treatment was finished.

[Footnote 1: Byron {{appears to}} have {{suffered}} from what would now be described as infantile paralysis, which affected the inner muscles of the right leg and foot, and rendered him permanently lame. Before leaving London for Aberdeen, Mrs. Byron consulted John Hunter, who, in correspondence with Dr. Livingstone of Aberdeen, advised her as {{to the treatment of}} her son. Writing, May 31, 1791, to Mrs. Leigh, she says, [...] "George's foot turns inward, and it is the right foot; he walks quite {{on the side of his}} foot." [...] In 1798 the child was placed under the care of Lavender (see p. 7, note 1) at Nottingham, doubtless on the recommendation of his aunt. In July, 1799, he was taken to London, in order to consult Dr. Baillie. From July, 1799, till the end of 1802, he was attended by Baillie in consultation with Dr. Laurie of 2, Bartholomew's <b>Close.</b> Special <b>appliances</b> were made for the boy, under their superintendence, by a scientific bootmaker named Sheldrake, in the Strand. In 'The Lancet' for 1827-8 (vol. ii. p. 779) Mr. T. Sheldrake describes [...] "Lord Byron's case," [...] giving an illustration of the foot. His account does not tally, in some respects, with that taken from contemporary letters, and his sketch represents the left not the right leg. But the nature and extent of Byron's lameness have been the subject of a curious variety of opinion. Lady Blessington, Moore, Gait, the Contessa Albrizzi, never knew which foot was deformed. Jackson, the boxer, thought it was the 'left' foot. Trelawney says that it proceeded from a contraction of the back sinews, and that the 'right' foot was most distorted. The lasts from which his shoes were made by Swift, the Southwell bootmaker, are preserved in the Nottingham Museum, and in both the foot is perfect in shape. The last pair of shoes modelled on them were made May 7, 1807. Mrs. Leigh Hunt says that the 'left' foot was shrunken, but was not a club-foot. Stendhal says the 'right' foot. Thorwaldsen indicates the 'left' foot. Dr. James Millingen, who inspected the feet after the poet's death, says that there was a malformation of the 'left' foot and leg, and that he was born club-footed. Two surgical boots are in the possession of Mr. Murray, made for Byron as a child; both are for the 'right' foot, ankle, and leg, and, assuming that they were made to fit the foot, they are too long and thin for a club-foot. Both at Dulwich and at Harrow, Byron was frequently seen by Laurie, whom Mrs. Byron paid, as she once complained in a letter to Laurie, [...] "at the rate of £150 a year." [...] It is difficult to see what more could have been done for the boy, and the explanation of the failure to effect a cure is probably to be found in the following extracts from two of Laurie's letters to Mrs. Byron. The first is dated December 7, 1801:-- ...|$|R
