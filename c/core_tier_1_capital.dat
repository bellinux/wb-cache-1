40|$|After the {{collapse}} of Lehman Brothers, a rapid and far-reaching shrinkage of international banks' assets {{with a focus on}} foreign claims took place. For the largest 67 German banking groups, we find that both their characteristics and behavior in the pre-crisis episode had repercussions for the crisis period. Above all, prior non-traditional banking activities - proxied by the relevance of securities and noninterest income - resulted in balance sheet contraction in the crisis. While, from 2002 to mid- 2008, a disproportionately high growth rate in profits to assets is found to be indicative of too much risk taking, both high average income and a strong balance sheet expansion in the pre-crisis period are found to be positive per se. In contrast, a high average income or a strong growth in assets in just the last {{three and a half years}} before the outbreak of the crisis put balance sheets during the crisis under adjustment pressure. During the crisis, short-term wholesale funding proved to be a disadvantage, while good capital endowment (<b>core</b> <b>Tier</b> <b>1</b> <b>capital</b> to RWA ratio), deposit funding and strong affiliate presence abroad had a stabilizing impact.

40|$|We {{formulate}} a stochastic optimal control {{problem for the}} capital structure of depository financial institutions (DFIs), where {{the market value of}} equity is maximized in a dividend discount framework. The key objective is to study capital structure behavior of DFIs under uncertain market conditions when governmental capital regulations are imposed, in particular minimum requirements for the <b>Core</b> <b>Tier</b> <b>1</b> <b>capital</b> ratio given by the Basel III directive. We solve the problem by two distinct approaches based on dynamic programming: (1) by deriving and numerically solving the problem's Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation, and (2) by an approximate dynamic programming approach using Q-learning with artificial neural networks. The model is calibrated and tested for DNB ASA. The results obtained suggest that there is a significant cost for equity holders associated with governmental capital regulations, seen from the reduction in market value of equity when these are imposed. We find the impact of regulations to be stronger in times of high economic growth than during downturns. Moreover, given the current regulatory requirements, our model suggests that DNB ASA could increase shareholder value substantially by lowering its capital adequacy ratio...|$|E
5000|$|Banks use various {{regulatory}} measures {{to describe their}} financial strength, such as <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> <b>capital.</b> Such measures typically start with equity and then add or subtract other measures. Banks and regulators {{have been criticized for}} including relatively [...] "weaker" [...] or less tangible amounts in regulatory capital measures. For example, deferred tax assets (which represent future tax savings if a company makes a profit) and intangible assets (e.g., non-cash amounts like goodwill or trademarks) have been included in <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> <b>capital</b> calculations by some financial institutions. In other cases, banks were legally able to move liabilities off their balance sheets via structured investment vehicles, which improved their ratios. Critics suggest using the [...] "tangible common equity" [...] measure, which removes non-cash assets from these measures. Generally, the ratio of tangible common equity to assets is lower (i.e., more conservative) than the <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> ratio.|$|R

40|$|We use data on {{loan loss}} {{provisions}} and total loans over the period spanning 1995 until 2009 to estimate a stress testing model for the Luxembourg banking sector. The sample encompasses the recent global crisis and covers {{a period in which}} the average probability of default of the Luxembourg banking sector?s counterparties is observed to increase significantly. A joint model, consisting of several macroeconomic variables and the logit-transformed probability of default, is specified and estimated via seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). The results suggest that counterparty default rates are significantly affected by the euro area real GDP growth rate, the real interest rate and a domestic property price index. Conversely, changes in the Luxembourg real GDP growth rate have a much smaller effect on counterparty risk. We attribute this to the large number of foreign subsidiaries operating within Luxembourg. The estimated model is then used to simulate values of the probability of default and the macroeconomic variables over a horizon of 10 quarters. This allows us to construct distributions for the probability of default under both baseline and adverse scenarios. From the results of these simulations stressed Basel II <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> <b>capital</b> ratios are calculated and compared to their associated unstressed capitalization levels. Our calculations suggest that, under all the given adverse macroeconomic scenarios, the aggregate Luxembourg financial sector remains above the 4 % minimum Basel II <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> <b>capital</b> requirement.

40|$|The paper finds that, given Australia's {{conservative}} approach {{in implementing the}} Basel II framework, Australian banks' headline capital ratios underestimate their capital strengths. Given their high capital quality and the progress in their funding profiles since the global financial crisis, the Australian banks are making good progress toward meeting the Basel III requirements, including the new liquidity standards. Stress tests calibrated on the Irish crisis experience show that the banks could withstand sizable shocks to their exposure to residential mortgages. However, combining residential mortgage shocks with corporate losses expected {{at the peak of}} the global financial crisis would put more pressure on Australian banks' capital.

40|$|This thesis studies {{credit risk}} {{determinants}} in the Chinese banking industry. Generally speaking, bank credit risk {{is influenced by}} macroeconomic conditions, counterparty characteristics, and bank-specific factors. Various credit risk assessing models {{could be used to}} quantify the effects of different credit risk determinants. Chinese banks are researching and developing appropriate and advanced credit risk systems to narrow the gap with foreign banks. This paper establishes and estimates a credit risk model for the Chinese banking industry taking into account the data for the period from 2002 to 2009. The empirical results suggest a significant and fairly robust relationship between credit risks and key factors including the microeconomic factors (total loan ratio, loan loss provision, <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> <b>capital</b> ratio, and bank size) and macroeconomic factors (gross domestic product (GDP) growth, consumer price index (CPI) growth, and unemployment rate). The author also raises the issue of whether the determinants of non-performing loans are or are not similar between national commercial banks (NCBs) and urban commercial banks (UCBs). By comparing the regression results, it is found that five factors: total loan ratio, <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> ratio, bank size, GDP growth and unemployment rate, have major influences on NCB credit risk, meanwhile, UCB credit risk is significantly affected by loan loss provision, <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> ratio, CPI growth and unemployment rate...|$|R
40|$|The {{correlation}} bias {{refers to}} the fact that claim subordination in the capital structure of the firm influences claim holders’ preferred degree of asset correlation in portfolios held by the firm. Using the copula capital structure model, it is shown that the correlation bias shifts shareholder preferences towards highly correlated assets, making financial institutions more prone to fail and increasing systemic risk given interconnectedness in the financial system. The implications for systemic risk and prudential regulation are assessed under the prism of Basel III, and potential solutions involving changes to the prudential framework and corporate governance are suggested.

40|$|We {{bring to}} bear a hand-collected dataset of {{executive}} turnovers in U.

Specifically, we focus on a new face of market discipline: stakeholders'' ability to fire an executive. Using conditional logit regressions to examine the roles of debtholders, shareholders, and regulators in removing executives, we present novel evidence that executives are more likely to be dismissed if their bank is risky, incurs losses, cuts dividends, has a high charter value, and holds high levels of subordinated debt.

40|$|AbstractOur paper {{consists}} {{mainly to}} shed light into the field of bank capital structure and regulatory capital. We use the panel data set of bank leverage and <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> <b>capital</b> ratio. Our dataset comprises the 172 French banks; commercial banks, cooperative banks, investment banks and saving banks covering the period of 2002 to 2012. We estimate models with generalized method of moments (GMM). Our results support both the theory of corporate finance and the buffer view, where a tendency towards the latter seems to be evident for banks. This is consistent with an effect of capital regulation on bank capital structure. We introduce also Tier <b>1</b> <b>capital</b> ratio as an explanatory variable to analyse the effect of capital regulation. However, Tier <b>1</b> <b>capital</b> total for banks seems to be increased. This implies that Risk-Weighted Assets increased, which may stem from internal model improvements. Furthermore, we show {{that the number of}} unprofitable, dividend-paying banks decreased. Our result indicates that this type of risk-shifting, where equity holders are favored over debt holders. The issuance of equity seems to be applied as a last remedy used when earnings are declining. All these findings are confirmed after taking into account an alternative measure the regulatory capital ratio in order to examine the capital regulation compliance of banks. Our finding contributes to the lack of the literature by investigating in this field of research...|$|R
