40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper’s {{focus is}} on the {{modeling}} methodology of (steel) fiber reinforcement in concrete. The orthogonal values of fiber efficiency are presented. Bulk as well as boundary situations are covered. Fiber structure is assumed due to external <b>compaction</b> <b>by</b> <b>vibration</b> to display a partially linear planar structure (Stro-even-concept), which can even be simplified in many practical situations to a partially planar system. The two unknown parameters can be experimentally assessed in a single vertical projection image by orthogonal line scanning. Several boundary conditions are distinguished and the practical case of a thin SFRC plate is evalu-ated. Advantages over a practical but very approximate proposal in the open literature are shown. ...|$|E
40|$|By its technology, Self-Compacting Concrete {{does not}} need <b>compaction</b> <b>by</b> <b>vibration.</b> Compaction of this concrete, in every part, or {{in every corner of}} the formwork, {{including}} its hardly available parts, is done without any external forces except its own weight. These properties are achieved by adding superplasticizers, commonly with new Viscosity Modification Admixtures, or/and determined amount of powders. It is possible to use different mineral additions, where the use of those which are industrial by - products (like fly ash) has multiple environmental benefits. Lack of natural aggregate in urban areas and increasing distance between deposits of high - quality natural aggregate and building sites, forced building contractors to analyze possibility of replacing of natural aggregate with recycled materials (masonry, slag, concrete, etc.). On the other hand, huge amount of old concrete exists in urban areas and its removal and deposition is a big ecological problem. Aim of this paper is analysis of properties and technology of Self-Compacting Concrete with different mineral additions (lime, fly ash and silica fume), natural and recycled aggregate, considering mixes without recycled aggregate, with third recycled fraction, and with second and third recycled fractions...|$|E

The four {{samples are}} assembled with different preparation procedures, {{two of which}} aim to reproduce experimental <b>compaction</b> <b>by</b> <b>vibration</b> and lubrication. The mechanical properties of the samples are found to change with the preparation history, and to depend much more on coordination number than on density. Secondly, the fluctuations in the particle displacements from the average strain are analysed, {{and the way they}} affect the macroscopic behavior analyzed. It is found that only the average over equally oriented contacts of the relative displacement these fluctuations induce is relevant at the macroscopic scale. This average depends on coordination number, average geometry of the contact network and average contact stiffness. As far as the separate contributions from particle displacements and rotations are concerned, the former is found to counteract the average strain along the contact normal, while the latter do in the tangential plane. Conversely, the tangential components of the center displacements mainly arise to enforce local equilibrium, and have a small, and generally stiffening effect at the macro-scale. Finally, the fluctuations and the shear modulus that result from two approaches available in the literature are estimated numerically. These approaches are both based on the equilibrium of a small-sized representative assembly. The improvement of these estimate with respect to the average strain assumption indicates that the fluctuations relevant to the macroscopic behavior occur with short correlation length...|$|E

40|$|We quantitatively {{studied the}} {{advantages}} of improving the compaction of a powder waste by several techniques, including its pelletization. The goal is increasing the mass storage capacity in a given storage volume, and reducing the permeability of air and moisture, that may trigger exothermic spontaneous reactions in organic waste, particularly as powders. The study is based on dried sludges from a wastewater treatment, mainly from tanneries, but the indications are valid and useful for any waste {{in the form of}} powder, suitable to pelletization. Measurements of bulk density have been carried out at the industrial and laboratory scale, using different packing procedures, amenable to industrial processes. Waste as powder, pellets and their mixtures have been considered. The bulk density of waste as powder increases from 0. 64 t/m 3 (simply poured) to 0. 74 t/m 3 (tapped) and finally to 0. 82 t/m 3 by a suitable, yet simple, packing procedure that we called dispersion filling, with a net gain of 28 % in the <b>compaction</b> <b>by</b> simply modifying the collection procedure. Pelletization increases <b>compaction</b> <b>by</b> definition, but the packing of pellets is relatively coarse. Some increase in bulk density of pellets can be achieved <b>by</b> tapping; <b>vibration</b> and dispersion filling are not efficient with pellets. Mixtures of powder and pellets is the optimal packing policy. The best compaction result was achieved <b>by</b> controlled <b>vibration</b> of a 30 / 70 wt% mixture of powders and pellets, leading to a final bulk density of 1 t/m 3, i. e. an improvement of <b>compaction</b> <b>by</b> more than 54 % with respect to simply poured powders, but also larger than 35 % compared to just pellets. That means increasing the mass storage capacity by a factor of 1. 56. Interestingly, vibration can be the most or the least effective procedure to improve compaction of mixtures, depending on characteristics of vibration. The optimal packing (30 / 70 wt% powders/pellets) proved to effectively mitigate the onset of smouldering, leading to self-heating, according to standard tests, whereas the pure pelletization totally removes the self-heating hazard...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{structural}} use {{of steel}} fiber-reinforced concrete SFRC {{relies on the}} assumption of uniform dispersion of fibers within the elements. Fiber dispersion related issues hence stand as a cutting edge research and technology development topic. The use of self-consolidating concrete SCC, thanks to its rheological stability and self-placability, {{which leads to the}} elimination of <b>compaction</b> <b>by</b> <b>vibration,</b> may be helpful in guaranteeing a uniform dispersion of fibers. With reference to the latter, several techniques e. g., based on alternate current impedance spectroscopy AC-IS, microwave reflectometry etc. have been developed {{in the last few years}} for its nondestructive monitoring. Investigation into the connections between fiber dispersion and the performance of the composite in the fresh and hardened state stand as the natural completion for a thorough assessment of the FRC properties, aimed at promoting its wider use for full load bearing structural applications. This paper presents the results of a research project aimed at the above said purpose. Based on a previously calibrated mix-design methodology, suitable specimens were cast with SFRC characterized by different performance in the fresh state vibration-, self-, and segregation consolidating and tested in four-point bending, in order to assess the connections among fresh state behavior and fiber dispersion, herein investigated by means of AC-IS, and the performance in the hardened state. The results, highlighting this correlation, point out their importance for a design of the material composition “tailored” to the anticipated mechanical performance and to the specific structural applicatio...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} during the bentonite shield tunnel drive for the Acton Grange trunk outfall sewer at Warrington, Cheshire. This tunnel is driven through cohesionless Drift deposits beneath a built-up urban environment, with a cover of less than 6 m. The environmental effects of the ground vibration caused by the excavation process are investigated with particular regard to ground settlement by compaction. The geology of the area and the technical and commercial factors {{which led to the}} choice of the bentonite tunnelling system are described. Previous work on <b>compaction</b> <b>by</b> <b>vibration</b> is critically reviewed and methods to assess a soil's potential for compaction are given. The vibration instrumentation is described and relevant wave propagation theory is developed with emphasis on body waves from underground sources. Vibration data were recorded from transducers located in boreholes, on the pavement surface, on the tunnelling machine and on the concrete tunnel lining. These records were processed to characterise the vibrations in terms of peak particle velocities, frequency spectra and spatial attenuation. The maximum measured ground vibration (expressed in terms of resultant peak particle velocity) was 3. 90 mm/s. The vibration was characterised by random high velocity particle motions resulting from impacts between the machine's disc cutters and glacial boulders in the tunnel face. Surface and subsurface settlement measurements were made along the tunnel line and structural damage to property above the tunnel was observed. Laboratory tests and other field data showed that the ground in this area was likely to settle at levels of vibration lower than those measured from the tunnelling machine. The vibration caused by the excavation process caused ground compaction which contributed to ground settlement and the ensuing damage to the overlying structures. The vibration was not likely to have damaged these properties directly but did cause considerable nuisance to the residents...|$|E

40|$|After {{repeated}} subcube allocation and deallocation, the hypercube system {{tends to}} become fragmented, {{which can be}} taken care of <b>by</b> using subcube <b>compaction.</b> Basic buddy-subcube compaction deals with compacting free buddy-subcubes with the same dimension concurrently. All migration paths are pairwise disjoint and contain no links of active subcubes, so that task migration can be performed without suspending the execution of other jobs. This paper considers quick buddy-subcube compaction in that not only can free subcubes with two adjacent dimensions be compacted concurrently, but two disjoint paths can be established between every pair of source-target nodes. Parallel subcube compaction with two concurrent dimensions apparently speeds up subcube <b>compaction</b> <b>by</b> a factor of two. The use of double disjoint paths between each pair of source-target nodes also speeds up subcube <b>compaction</b> <b>by</b> a factor of nearly two.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{production of}} high-strength concrete which meets the desired strength and durability {{is dependent on}} optimising its rheological (or flow) properties and reducing its loss of workability during the transportation, placing and compaction stages. The research presented in this thesis aimed to: 1. Determine whether mix stability and compactability can be adequately described by the two Bingham parameters of yield value and plastic viscosity. 2. Reduce the uncertainties in material selection {{with regards to the}} performance of superplasticizers and cement replacement materials. 3. Examine how the two Bingham parameters vary at different degrees of <b>compaction</b> <b>by</b> <b>vibration.</b> 4. Determine how these influence the strength development characteristics in the hardened state. 5. An additional aim was to carry out any modifications to the test apparatus and methods which experience makes necessary. Measurements with Tattersall's MH two-point workability test apparatus indicated that mix stability correlates more closely with the yield value than with plastic viscosity, whilst the opposite is true with respect to compactability under self-weight. The performance of conventional and new-generation superplasticizers (based on SMF, SNF, MLS, Vinyl and Acrylate polymers) was evaluated with different dosages, mixing procedures and cements. The SNF superplasticizer produced slightly lower initial workabilities than the Acrylate superplasticizer, but the longest workability retentions of the superplasticizers tested. Partial cement replacements by CSF in binary blends produced lower superplasticizer dosage demands, higher initial workabilities and longer workability retentions than those due to PFA and GGBS. When used in ternary blended cements, CSF enhanced the performance of mixes containing PFA or GGBS at w/b ratios of 0. 30 - 0. 22. A novel method developed to assess the vibration response of fresh concretes has, for the first time, demonstrated that both the yield value and plastic viscosity decrease during compaction. The method has also demonstrated that the maximum compressive strengths and densities of concretes compacted for different vibration durations/amplitudes coincide with the attainment of zero yield value. Continuous reductions in plastic viscosity during vibration mainly reduced the homogeneity of concrete compacted in short columns...|$|E

40|$|Mitochondria {{organize}} their genome in proteinĝ€"DNA complexes called nucleoids. The mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), a protein that regulates mitochondrial transcription, is abundant in these nucleoids. TFAM {{is believed to}} be essential for mitochondrial DNA compaction, yet the exact mechanism has not been resolved. Here we use a combination of single-molecule manipulation and fluorescence microscopy to show the nonspecific DNA-binding dynamics and <b>compaction</b> <b>by</b> TFAM. We observe that single TFAM proteins diffuse extensively over DNA (sliding) and, by collisions, form patches on DNA in a cooperative manner. Moreover, we demonstrate that TFAM induces <b>compaction</b> <b>by</b> changing the flexibility of the DNA, which can be explained by local denaturation of the DNA (melting). Both sliding of TFAM and DNA melting are also necessary characteristics for effective, specific transcription regulation by TFAM. This apparent connection between transcription and DNA organization clarifies how TFAM can accomplish two complementary roles in the mitochondrial nucleoid at the same time. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

For validation purposes, the lattice-Boltzmann method is compared against an explicit finite-difference method for incompressible flow in simpler geometries. Simulating slow creeping flow through three-dimensional channels of different polygonal cross sections and three-dimensional porous structures of intermediate complexity checked the accuracy of the lattice-Boltzmann scheme used.
