40|$|Abstract — Predicting the {{residual}} {{energy of the}} battery source that powers a portable electronic device is imperative in designing and applying an effective dynamic power management policy for the device. The paper starts up by showing that a 30 % error in predicting the <b>battery</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Lithium-ion <b>battery</b> can result in up to 20 % performance degradation for a dynamic voltage and frequency scaling algorithm. Next, this paper presents a closed-form analytical expression for predicting the remaining <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lithium-ion <b>battery.</b> The proposed highlevel model, which relies on online current and voltage measurements, correctly accounts for the temperature and cycle aging effects. The accuracy of the high-level model is validated by comparing it with DUALFOIL simulation results, demonstrating <b>a</b> maximum <b>of</b> 5 % error between simulated and predicted data.

5000|$|Manufacturers {{specify the}} <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> at a {{specified}} discharge rate. For example, a battery might be rated at 100 A·h when discharged {{at a rate}} that will fully discharge the battery in 20 hours (at 5 amperes for this example). If discharged at a faster rate the delivered capacity is less. Peukert's law describes a power relationship between the discharge current (normalized to some base rated current) and delivered capacity (normalized to the rated capacity) over some specified range of discharge currents. If Peukert's constant , the exponent, were equal to unity, the delivered capacity would be independent of the current. For a real battery the exponent is greater than unity, and capacity decreases as discharge rate increases. For a lead-acid battery [...] is typically between 1.1 and 1.3. For different lead-acid rechargeable battery technologies it generally ranges from 1.05 to 1.15 for VRSLAB AGM batteries, from 1.1 to 1.25 for gel, and from 1.2 to 1.6 for flooded batteries. The Peukert constant varies with the age of the battery, generally increasing (getting worse) with age. Application at low discharge rates must take into account the battery self-discharge current. At very high currents, practical batteries will give less capacity than predicted with a fixed exponent. The equation {{does not take into account}} the effect of temperature on battery capacity.|$|E

We review results that pertain to the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> and its dependence on the intensity of the discharge current. The phenomena of charge recovery that takes place under bursty or pulsed discharge conditions is identified as a mechanism that can be exploited to enhance the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery.</b> The bursty nature of many data traffic sources suggests that data transmissions may provide natural opportunities for charge recovery. We explore stochastic models to track charge recovery in conjunction with bursty discharge processes. Using the postulated model, we identify the improvement to battery capacity that results from pulsed discharge driven by bursty stochastic discharge demand. The insight from this analysis leads us to propose discharge shaping techniques that trade-off energy efficiency with delay...|$|E

40|$|State of Health (SOH) is an {{important}} characteristic in determining the overall profile of a battery. SOH {{is a measure of}} the remaining full charge <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> with respect to its nominal or rated capacity. As a battery ages and is continuously charged and discharged, the chemical composition starts to degrade. Sulphation of the plates starts to occur and the condition of the battery deteriorates which leads to a decrease in capacity. SOH determination can aid in the optimisation of the battery and prevent the battery being over charged and over discharged. This paper describes a novel two-pulse load test to determine the SOH of a Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) battery. The measurement of the change in battery terminal voltage (AV) in the second pulse will alter as the battery ages in relation with the change in the maximum available capacity and this in turn allows the determination of SOH.
