40|$|In Henan province, {{and through}} out China, both {{students}} in <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> <b>countrysides</b> {{are using the}} same textbooks for junior high schools. This phenomenon unavoidably resulted {{in the fact that}} it is difficult for students in rural junior high school to understand the contents in textbooks. In order to investigate whether the learning difficulty results partly from the inadaptability of the in-use textbooks to students in junior high school of Henan Province, we assumed that the three-version textbooks being used in the schools are not adaptable. Through observation, plus analysis of the questionnaire, we find that in compiling textbooks, rural students’ needs are always ignored consciously or unconsciously. Consequently, our hypothesis was confirmed by the conclusion. In the end we strongly recommend that rural students’ special needs should be taken into consideration. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{writer in}} this thesis is trying to analyse Jane Austen's {{settings}} and characters in Northanger Abbey and Mansfield Park as they reveal the dangers of worldliness which could lead human beings into self-destruction. In the two novels, Austen describes the characteristics of big <b>cities</b> <b>and</b> <b>countrysides,</b> how values result in different attitudes toward life to the inhabitants. As in Northanger Abbeyf the worldly values {{in the big city}} cause the urban to seem to be unagreeable in their conducts; whereas in Mansfield Park, such attitude has become a threat to the structure of the society. Indeed since the values of the urban settings are in contrast to those of the rural settings, the characters of the urban are also very different from the countryman. However, through the analysis, the writer finds out that although setting moulds character, everybody still has a choice to follow their moral conscience instead of merely the common social behaviors...|$|E
40|$|In {{light of}} its {{foundation}} in a distinctively relational analysis of spaces, the term ‘urban political ecology’ (see Heynen, Kaika & Swyngedouw, 2006; Loftus, 2012) {{has always been}} much too simplistic to fully cover what this strands optimally points towards. Despite emphasising ‘urban’ as signifier, cities conceptualized as “dense networks of interwoven sociospatial processes that are simultaneously local and global, human and physical, cultural and organic” (Swyngedouw & Heynen, 2003 : 899) suggests the necessity of abandoning the city-as-such as unit of analysis - or even as taken for granted {{point of departure for}} inquiries. It suggests the possibility for complex analyses able to target an urban bias inherent to so much critical theory (cf. Barraclough, 2013). In this paper I utilize inspiration drawn from urban political ecology to analyse the dynamics of upscale golf landscapes, thus simultaneously building on and ‘reversing’ urban political ecology by discussing green spaces outside cities’ administrative boundaries. I work with a relational ontology where spaces are regarded as constituted by a myriad of various flows and forces, I work with an emphasis on landscapes as simultaneously discursive and material, and I work with an approach emphasising the exertions of power and the struggles that constitute spaces (cf. Mitchell, 2008; Swyngedouw & Heynen, 2003). Built on preferences for scenic vistas and undisturbed nature, and often built on the appropriation and selective transformation of manorial landscapes, upscale golf landscapes are intimately tied to popular conceptualisations of attractive rural milieus. But simultaneously attracting tourists travelling from far away urban centres, and providing lush green meeting-spaces for firms where offices otherwise often occupy central places in metropolitan areas these landscapes defy any neat distinction between urban and rural (cf. Woods, 2007, 2013). Topographically removed from the concrete and high-rises these high-end leisure landscapes nonetheless exist in symbiosis with these spaces. They thrive from the established road and rail networks connecting suburbs and city centres, and the networks of planes and airports connecting continents with each other. Thus these landscapes aptly illuminate how, just like cities, ‘peri-urban’ or ‘rural’ spaces are dense network of interwoven sociospatial processes tying together many places (<b>cities</b> <b>and</b> <b>countrysides)</b> and many actors (human, and non-human) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{specific}} spatial {{context in}} the densely urbanised {{northern part of}} Belgium, Flanders, offers a sort of laboratory conditions to study, design and plan fragments of open space in an urbanising context. A chronological analysis of documents in three periods relevant to Flemish spatial planning policy allows to conclude that one single planning discourse has reigned spatial planning in Flanders already since {{the design of the}} first zoning plans 45 years ago. This planning discourse considers <b>city</b> <b>and</b> <b>countryside</b> as two separate and separated entities. Today however, the validity of this dominant discourse is increasingly under pressure. An obvious societal need appears to be growing to turn around the perception of a possible contradiction between <b>city</b> <b>and</b> <b>countryside.</b> In a densely urbanised spatial context, alternative planning discourses should be based on the idea of open spaces that offer complementary services within a partnership between <b>city</b> <b>and</b> <b>countryside...</b>|$|R
