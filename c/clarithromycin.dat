5|$|Protease inhibitors, nefazodone, sertraline, grapefruit, fluoxetine, erythromycin, diltiazem, <b>clarithromycin</b> {{inhibit the}} {{metabolism}} of midazolam, {{leading to a}} prolonged action. St John's wort, rifapentine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin enhance the metabolism of midazolam leading to a reduced action. Sedating antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opioids, antipsychotics and alcohol enhance the sedative effects of midazolam. Midazolam is metabolized almost completely by cytochrome P450-3A4. Atorvastatin administration along with midazolam results in a reduced elimination rate of midazolam. St John's wort decreases the blood levels of midazolam. Grapefruit juice reduces intestinal 3A4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, are an {{effective}} treatment for DPB when taken regularly {{over an extended}} period of time. <b>Clarithromycin</b> or roxithromycin are also commonly used. The successful results of macrolides in DPB and similar lung diseases stems from managing certain symptoms through immunomodulation (adjusting the immune response), which can be achieved by taking the antibiotics in low doses. Treatment consists of daily oral administration of erythromycin for two to three years, an extended period that has been shown to dramatically improve the effects of DPB. This is apparent when an individual undergoing treatment for DPB, among a number of disease-related remission criteria, has a normal neutrophil count detected in BAL fluid, and blood gas (an arterial blood test that measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood) readings show that free oxygen in the blood is within the normal range. Allowing a temporary break from erythromycin therapy in these instances has been suggested, to reduce the formation of macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa. However, DPB symptoms usually return, and treatment would need to be resumed. Although highly effective, erythromycin may not prove successful in all individuals with the disease, particularly if macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa is present or previously untreated DPB has progressed to the point where respiratory failure is occurring.|$|E
25|$|Therapy {{for older}} {{children}} and adults generally includes treatment for atypical bacteria: typically a macrolide antibiotic (such as azithromycin or <b>clarithromycin)</b> or a quinolone, such as levofloxacin. Doxycycline is the antibiotic of choice in the UK for atypical bacteria, due to increased clostridium difficile colitis in hospital patients linked to {{the increased use of}} <b>clarithromycin.</b>|$|E
25|$|When H. pylori {{infection}} is present, {{the most effective}} treatments are combinations of 2 antibiotics (e.g. <b>clarithromycin,</b> amoxicillin, tetracycline, metronidazole) and a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), sometimes together with a bismuth compound. In complicated, treatment-resistant cases, 3 antibiotics (e.g. amoxicillin + <b>clarithromycin</b> + metronidazole) may be used together with a PPI and sometimes with bismuth compound. An effective first-line therapy for uncomplicated cases would be amoxicillin + metronidazole + pantoprazole (a PPI).|$|E
25|$|PPIs {{have been}} used {{successfully}} in triple-therapy regiments with <b>clarithromycin</b> and amoxicillin for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori with {{no significant difference between}} different PPI-based regimens.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroquinolones, and a newer {{macrolide}} antibiotic such as <b>clarithromycin</b> or a tetracycline like doxycycline, {{are used}} in those who have severe allergies to penicillins. Because of increasing resistance to amoxicillin the 2012 guideline of the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends amoxicillin-clavulanate as the initial treatment of choice for bacterial sinusitis. The guidelines also recommend against other commonly used antibiotics, including azithromycin, <b>clarithromycin</b> and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, because of growing drug resistance. The FDA recommends {{against the use of}} fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{antibiotic}} <b>clarithromycin</b> {{was invented}} by scientists at the Japanese drug company Taisho Pharmaceutical in the 1970s {{as a result of}} their efforts to overcome the acid instability of erythromycin.|$|E
25|$|If treated early {{antibiotics}} {{for eight}} weeks are effective in 80% of people. This often includes the medications rifampicin and streptomycin. <b>Clarithromycin</b> or moxifloxacin are sometimes used instead of streptomycin.|$|E
25|$|Rifabutin, <b>clarithromycin</b> and {{clofazimine}} are antibiotics {{designed to}} attack mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, {{which may be}} a cause of Crohn's disease. This treatment, called Myoconda, is being tested by Giaconda.|$|E
25|$|Nevirapine is an inducer of {{cytochrome}} P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. It {{may reduce}} levels of several co-administered drugs including the antiretrovirals efavirenz, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir, {{as well as}} <b>clarithromycin,</b> ketoconazole, forms of hormonal contraception, and methadone.|$|E
25|$|These {{drugs are}} listed here {{either because they}} are not very {{effective}} (e.g., <b>clarithromycin)</b> or because their efficacy has not been proven (e.g., linezolid, R207910). Rifabutin is effective, but is not included on the WHO list because for most developing countries, it is impractically expensive.|$|E
25|$|Peptic ulcers may {{be treated}} with omeprazole. Treatment of H. pylori {{infection}} can be completed by taking a triple therapy combination of omeprazole, amoxicillin, and <b>clarithromycin</b> for 7–14 days. Amoxicillin may be replaced with metronidazole in patients who are allergic to penicillin.|$|E
25|$|Esomeprazole is {{combined}} with the antibiotics <b>clarithromycin</b> and amoxicillin (or metronidazole instead of amoxicillin in penicillin-hypersensitive patients) in a 10-day eradication triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori. Infection by H. pylori is a causative factor {{in the majority of}} peptic and duodenal ulcers.|$|E
25|$|The {{antibiotics}} erythromycin, <b>clarithromycin,</b> or azithromycin {{are typically}} the recommended treatment. Newer macrolides are frequently recommended due to {{lower rates of}} side effects. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) {{may be used in}} those with allergies to first-line agents or in infants who have a risk of pyloric stenosis from macrolides.|$|E
25|$|Hospitalized {{patients}} {{without risk}} for pseudomonas: This group requires intravenous antibiotics, with a quinolone active against streptococcus pneumoniae (such as levofloxacin), a β-lactam antibiotic (such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin/sulbactam or high-dose ampicillin plus a macrolide antibiotic (such as azithromycin or <b>clarithromycin)</b> for seven to ten days.|$|E
25|$|It is {{effective}} {{in the treatment of}} stomach infections of Helicobacter pylori. When used to treat H. pylori infection it is combined with lansoprazole, <b>clarithromycin,</b> omeprazole and others in varying amounts and dosage schedules. It is also used to treat Lyme disease in children under eight-years old.|$|E
25|$|If {{people are}} treated early, {{antibiotics}} {{for eight weeks}} are effective in 80%. The treatment often includes the medications rifampicin and streptomycin. <b>Clarithromycin</b> or moxifloxacin are sometimes used instead of streptomycin. Other treatments may include cutting out the ulcer. After the infection heals, the area typically has a scar.|$|E
25|$|Telithromycin is a semi-synthetic {{erythromycin}} derivative. It {{is created}} by substituting a ketogroup for the cladinose sugar and adding a carbamate ring in the lactone ring. An alkyl-aryl moiety is attached to this carbamate ring. Furthermore, the carbon at position 6 has been methylated, {{as is the case}} in <b>clarithromycin,</b> to achieve better acid-stability.|$|E
25|$|Healthy outpatients {{without risk}} factors: This group (the largest) is {{composed}} of otherwise-healthy patients without risk factors for DRSP, enteric gram-negative bacteria, pseudomonas or other, less-common, causes of CAP. Primary microoganisms are viruses, atypical bacteria, penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. Recommended drugs are macrolide antibiotics, such as azithromycin or <b>clarithromycin,</b> for seven to ten days.|$|E
25|$|Its use is advised {{against in}} people on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as <b>clarithromycin,</b> chloramphenicol, ketoconazole, {{ritonavir}} and nefazodone {{due to its}} reliance on CYP3A4 for metabolism. Likewise it is a CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 inhibitor and hence concurrent treatment with substrates {{of any of these}} enzymes may increase plasma concentrations of said drugs. Since imatinib is mainly metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A4, substances influencing the activity of this enzyme change the plasma concentration of the drug. An example of a drug that increases imatinib activity and therefore side effects by blocking CYP3A4 is ketoconazole. The same could be true of itraconazole, <b>clarithromycin,</b> grapefruit juice, among others. Conversely, CYP3A4 inductors like rifampicin and St. John's Wort reduce the drug's activity, risking therapy failure. Imatinib also acts as an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 2C9 and 2D6, increasing the plasma concentrations of a number of other drugs like simvastatin, ciclosporin, pimozide, warfarin, metoprolol, and possibly paracetamol. The drug also reduces plasma levels of levothyroxin via an unknown mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Outpatients with {{underlying}} {{illness or}} risk factors: Although this group {{does not require}} hospitalization, patients have underlying health problems (such as emphysema or heart failure) or {{are at risk for}} DRSP or enteric gram-negative bacteria. They are treated with a quinolone active against streptococcus pneumoniae (such as levofloxacin) or a β-lactam antibiotic (such as cefpodoxime, cefuroxime, amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) and a macrolide antibiotic, such as azithromycin or <b>clarithromycin,</b> for seven to ten days.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{avoiding}} things {{that cause the}} disease. Treatment includes medications such as antacids, H2 blockers, or proton pump inhibitors. During an acute attack drinking viscous lidocaine may help. If gastritis is due to NSAIDs these may be stopped. If H. pylori is present it may be treated {{with a combination of}} antibiotics such as amoxicillin and <b>clarithromycin.</b> For those with pernicious anemia, vitamin B12 supplements are recommended either by mouth or by injection. People are usually advised to avoid foods that bother them.|$|E
25|$|Supportive {{care must}} be {{provided}} to animals that have clinical signs. Subcutaneous or intravenous fluids are given to dehydrated animals, and severely anemic dogs may require a blood transfusion. Treatment for ehrlichiosis {{involves the use of}} antibiotics such as tetracycline or doxycycline for a period of at least six to eight weeks; response to the drugs may take one month. Treatment with macrolide antibiotics like <b>clarithromycin</b> and azithromycin is being studied. In addition, steroids may be indicated in severe cases in which the level of platelets is so low that the condition is life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|Clonazepam is lipid-soluble, rapidly {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier, and penetrates the placenta. It is {{extensively}} metabolised into pharmacologically inactive metabolites. Clonazepam is metabolized extensively via nitroreduction by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C19 {{and to a}} lesser extent CYP3A4. Erythromycin, <b>clarithromycin,</b> ritonavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, cimetidine, and grapefruit juice are inhibitors of CYP3A4 and can affect the metabolism of benzodiazepines. It has an elimination half-life of 19–60 hours. Peak blood concentrations of 6.5–13.5ng/mL were usually reached within 1–2 hours following a single 2mg oral dose of micronized clonazepam in healthy adults. In some individuals, however, peak blood concentrations were reached at 4–8 hours.|$|E
25|$|Co-administration of {{atorvastatin}} {{with one}} of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole, may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This {{is less likely to}} happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, <b>clarithromycin,</b> cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, or verapamil, and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as amiodarone and aprepitant. Often, bosentan, fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, and rifamycin, which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for norethisterone and ethinylestradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{is mainly}} by {{vaccination}} with the pertussis vaccine. Initial immunization is recommended between six and eight weeks of age, with four doses {{to be given}} {{in the first two}} years of life. The vaccine becomes less effective over time, with additional doses often recommended for older children and adults. Antibiotics may be used to prevent the disease in those who have been exposed and are at risk of severe disease. In those with the disease, antibiotics are useful if started within three weeks of the initial symptoms, but otherwise have little effect in most people. In children less than one year old and among those who are pregnant, they are recommended within six weeks of symptom onset. Antibiotics used include erythromycin, azithromycin, <b>clarithromycin,</b> or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Evidence to support interventions, other than antibiotics, for the cough is poor. Many children less than a year of age require hospitalization.|$|E
500|$|Once H. pylori is {{detected}} {{in a person}} with a peptic ulcer, the normal procedure is to eradicate it and allow the ulcer to heal. The standard first-line therapy is a one-week [...] "triple therapy" [...] consisting of proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and the antibiotics <b>clarithromycin</b> and amoxicillin. Variations of the triple therapy have been developed over the years, such as using a different proton pump inhibitor, as with pantoprazole or rabeprazole, or replacing amoxicillin with metronidazole for people who are allergic to penicillin. In areas with higher rates of <b>clarithromycin</b> resistance, other options are recommended. Such a therapy has revolutionized the treatment of peptic ulcers and has made a cure to the disease possible. Previously, the only option was symptom control using antacids, H2-antagonists or proton pump inhibitors alone.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{test tube}} model, <b>clarithromycin</b> (an {{antibiotic}} approved by the FDA {{for the treatment of}} infections) was found to return the function of the GABA system to normal in patients with primary hypersomnias. Investigators therefore treated a few patients with off-label <b>clarithromycin,</b> and most felt their symptoms improved with this treatment.

2500|$|Helicobacter pylori infection, {{alongside}} antibiotics (adjunctive treatment), {{treatment to}} kill H. pylori causing ulcers or other problems involves using two other drugs besides lansoprazole known as [...] "triple therapy", and involves taking twice daily for 10 or 14 days lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and <b>clarithromycin</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, a {{published}} report described the likely {{mechanism of action}} underlying not only the cases of liver failure but also cases of visual disturbances and exacerbations of myasthenia gravis. [...] The study showed that a pyridine moiety {{that is part of}} the telithromycin molecule acts as an antagonist on cholinergic receptors located in the neuromuscular junction, the ciliary ganglion of the eye and the vagus nerve innervating the liver. [...] Other macrolides, such as azithromycin and <b>clarithromycin</b> and the fluoroketolide, solithromycin, do not contain the pyridine [...] moiety and do not antagonize these cholinergic receptors significantly.|$|E
