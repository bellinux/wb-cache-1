60|$|Gentlemen,--I {{was highly}} gratified by the {{insertion}} of a portion of my letter in the last number of your valuable and entertaining Miscellany, though in a type which rendered its substance inaccessible even to the beautiful new spectacles presented to me by a Committee of the Parish on New Year's Day. I trust that I was able to bear your very considerable abridgment of my lucubrations with a spirit becoming a Christian. My third granddaughter, Rebekah, aged fourteen years, and whom I have trained to read slowly and with proper emphasis (a practice too much neglected in our modern systems of education), read aloud to me the excellent essay upon 'Old Age,' the author of which I cannot help suspecting to be {{a young man who}} has never yet known what it was to have snow (<b>canities</b> morosa) upon his own roof. Dissolve frigus, large super foco ligna reponens, is a rule for the young, whose woodpile is yet abundant for such cheerful lenitives. A good life behind him is the best thing to keep an old man's shoulders from shivering at every breath of sorrow or ill-fortune. But methinks it were easier for an old man to feel the disadvantages of youth than the advantages of age. Of these latter I reckon one of the chiefest to be this: that we attach a less inordinate value to our own productions, and, distrusting daily more and more our own wisdom (with the conceit whereof at twenty we wrap ourselves away from knowledge as with a garment), do reconcile ourselves with the wisdom of God. I could have wished, indeed, that room might have been made for the residue of the anecdote relating to Deacon Tinkham, which would not only have gratified a natural curiosity {{on the part of the}} publick (as I have reason to know from several letters of inquiry already received), but would also, as I think, have largely increased the circulation of your Magazine in this town. Nihil humani alienum, there is a curiosity about the affairs of our neighbors which is not only pardonable, but even commendable. But I shall abide a more fitting season.|$|E

50|$|Premature greying of hair, {{also known}} as <b>canities,</b> has {{significant}} adverse effects on the appearance, confidence, self-esteem, and social acceptance of the affected individual. Hair {{is said to have}} greyed prematurely if it occurs before the age of 20 years in Whites, before 25 years in Asians, and before 30 years in Africans.|$|E
50|$|Premature greying of {{hair has}} been {{observed}} with greater frequency among certain families, suggesting a familial predisposition for the condition. As hair pigmentation {{is a result of}} complex interaction between various genetic factors, it is thought that premature greying could be due to exhaustion of melanocyte's capability to produce hair pigmentation. Premature <b>canities</b> may occur alone as an autosomal dominant condition or in association with various autoimmune or premature aging syndromes. It needs to be differentiated from various genetic hypomelanotic hair disorders.|$|E
40|$|Premature graying is an {{important}} cause of low self-esteem, often interfering with socio-cultural adjustment. The onset and progression of graying or <b>canities</b> correlate very closely with chronological aging, and occur in varying degrees in all individuals eventually, regardless of gender or race. Premature <b>canities</b> may occur alone as an autosomal dominant condition or in association with various autoimmune or premature aging syndromes. It needs to be differentiated from various genetic hypomelanotic hair disorders. Reduction in melanogenically active melanocytes in the hair bulb of gray anagen hair follicles with resultant pigment loss {{is central to the}} pathogenesis of graying. Defective melanosomal transfers to cortical keratinocytes and melanin incontinence due to melanocyte degeneration are also believed to contribute to this. The white color of <b>canities</b> is an optical effect; the reflection of incident light masks the intrinsic pale yellow color of hair keratin. Full range of color from normal to white can be seen both along individual hair and from hair to hair, and admixture of pigmented and white hair is believed to give the appearance of gray. Graying of hair is usually progressive and permanent, but there are occasional reports of spontaneous repigmentation of gray hair. Studies evaluating the association of <b>canities</b> with osteopenia and cardiovascular disease have revealed mixed results. Despite the extensive molecular research being carried out to understand the pathogenesis of <b>canities,</b> there is paucity of effective evidence-based treatment options. Reports of repigmentation of previously white hair following certain inflammatory processes and use of drugs have suggested the possibility of cytokine-induced recruitment of outer sheath melanocytes to the hair bulb and rekindled the hope for finding an effective drug for treatment of premature <b>canities.</b> In the end, camouflage techniques using hair colorants are outlined...|$|E
40|$|Background: Premature <b>canities</b> is {{a common}} yet incompletely {{understood}} dermatological entity with scarce demographic and clinical data. Aim: Evaluation of the demographic and clinical profile of cases with premature <b>canities</b> and to look for systemic associations. Methods: Fifty two self-reported cases of premature <b>canities</b> (onset before 20 years of age) and {{an equal number of}} healthy controls were recruited from the outpatient department of the Department of Dermatology, Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital Delhi, India from November 2011 to March 2013. A detailed history including onset, duration and pattern of involvement, a family history with pedigree charting and scalp examination were recorded on a predesigned proforma. A history of atopy was looked for in all study subjects and they were screened for thyroid disorder and diabetes. Results: The mean age of cases and controls was comparable. The mean age of onset of graying was 11. 6 ± 3. 6 years. The mean duration at the time of presentation was 39. 8 ± 37. 2 months. The frontal region was the earliest affected area in 25 (48. 1 %) cases. Positive family history of premature <b>canities</b> was reported in 39 (75 %) cases with an equal prevalence on paternal and maternal sides. More than half of the cases, 29 (55. 8 %) reported having a first degree relative affected by premature <b>canities,</b> 13 (25 %) had a second degree and 20 (38. 5 %) had a third degree relative affected. Atopy was found to be strongly associated with premature <b>canities</b> with an odds ratio of 3. 8. No association with thyroid abnormality or diabetes mellitus was seen. Limitation: The study suffered from the limitation of a small sample size. Conclusion: It was observed that the process of graying mostly starts in the frontal region. It was also found to be associated with a strong family history and atopic predisposition. Larger studies are recommended to arrive at a definite conclusion...|$|E
40|$|Although a rare event, sudden {{whitening}} of hair (<b>canities</b> subita) {{has reportedly}} affected {{a number of}} well-known historical figures, usually in relation to dramatic events in their lives. Although early accounts are substantiated by more recent case reports in scientific literature, we suspect that the phenomenon is not only used as a literary means in fiction, {{with the aim of}} dramatizing, but probably also in historical accounts. For this purpose, we examine the case history of Henry III of Navarre who allegedly turned white on the evening of the Saint Bartholomew’s day massacre, and challenge this claim, due to inconsistencies in his biography, with the current pathophysiological understanding of <b>canities</b> subita...|$|E
40|$|Background: There is no uniform grading {{scale for}} {{objective}} assessment of premature <b>canities</b> {{that can serve}} as a reference. The aim {{of the study was to}} devise an objective and reproducible scoring system to assess the severity of premature <b>canities.</b> Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted from November 2011 to April 2013 in a tertiary care setup with 52 apparently healthy individuals with onset of premature graying of scalp hair before the age of 20 years. A new scoring system (Graying Severity Score, GSS) was devised to evaluate the extent of graying taking into account five representative sites from the scalp by two independent investigators and analysed for agreement. GSS ranged from 0 to 15 that was further graded as mild, moderate, and severe. Results: The highest total GSS attained was 13 and lowest was 4 (mean = 6. 6 ± 1. 97). Of the 52 patients 17 (32. 69 %) had mild, 32 (61. 54 %) moderate, and only 3 (5. 77 %) had severe GSS. Scores of both investigators were found to have good agreement. The intraclass correlation calculated by the two-way mixed model using the absolute agreement definition for the GSS was 0. 967 (CI = 0. 944 – 0. 981; P = 0. 000) and for GSS grade was 0. 962 (P = 0. 000). In the study subjects the frontal and the vertex regions were found to be the worst affected. Conclusion: GSS is a novel, numeric, objective, and reproducible tool for evaluation of premature <b>canities</b> that can be used to follow up and assess therapeutic response. Further large scale studies are recommended to optimize its utility...|$|E

40|$|Statistical {{observation}} {{was made}} {{on the status of}} lips o trichia, status of hairing (beard, chest bristle, pubisure and leg bristle), status of <b>canities,</b> coital frequency, habits of foods and tasts and occupation on 434 patients with prostatic hypertrophy, 47 patients with prostatic cancer and 40 patients with reserved controls who visited the Department of Urology at Hiroshima University Hospital. Comparative analysis showed that the patients with prostatic hypertrophy have a tendency of fainting forehead hearing and thinning of bearing, but many patients with prostatic cancer showed thick bearing. The chest bristle was not observed in most of patients with prostatic hypertrophy, while it was seen in 30 % of the patients with prostatic cancer. Concerning the pubisure, more than a half of patients with prostatic hypertrophy were noted to have horizontal type I and II or sagittal type I, while more than 60 % of patients with prostatic cancer showed sagittal type II or acuminate type. On the leg bristle, the patients with prostatic cancer had thicker hairing than with prostatic hypertrophy or controls. Status of <b>canities</b> were not different between the groups. A tendency of higher coital frequency was noted in patients with prostatic hypertrophy. Further, the patients with prostatic hypertrophy had a trend to take more fatty food in every age group than the other patients. There was no noticeable difference on occupation between the groups...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of self-reported premature hair graying (PHG) {{seems to be}} on the rise. PHG has a profound impact on the patient's quality of life. It remains an incompletely understood etiology with limited and modest treatment options. Aim: The evaluation of the demographic and clinical profile of patients with premature <b>canities,</b> and exploration of the association of this entity with certain systemic disorders suspected to be related to its etiology. Methods: Seventy-one cases of premature <b>canities</b> (onset noticed by patients before 25 years of age) presenting to an urban skin clinic in Gurugram, India, between September 2012 and September 2015 with this complaint were retrospectively analyzed. The patient records were retrieved that provided details of the onset, duration and pattern of involvement, history, and examination findings (scalp, cutis, and general physical). Since all these patients had been screened for anemia, thyroid disorder, fasting blood glucose, and Vitamin B 12 levels at the time of presentation, these parameters were also available for analysis. Results: The mean age at onset of graying was 10. 2 ± 3. 6 years (range: 5 – 19 years), with an almost equal gender distribution. The earliest age of onset recorded was 5 years. A positive family history of PHG (at least one of the biological parents or siblings) was obtained in 64 (90. 1 %) of the cases. The temporal regions of the scalp (35. 2 %) were most commonly involved followed by the frontal region (18. 3 %). Hypovitaminosis B 12 and hypothyroidism showed significant association with the disorder, whereas anemia, serum ferritin, and fasting blood glucose did not. Conclusion: The age of onset of hair graying can be as low as 5 years. Temporal and frontal areas are the most commonly involved sites. A strong family history, Vitamin B 12 deficiency, and hypothyroidism are strongly associated with PHG. Larger case–control studies are mandated for discerning the correlation of these and other risk factors with PHG...|$|E

40|$|YesHumans {{are social}} animals that {{communicate}} disproportionately via potent genetic signals imbued {{in the skin}} and hair, including racial, ethnic, health, gender, and age status. For {{the vast majority of}} us, age-related hair pigment loss becomes the inescapable signal of our disappearing youth. The hair follicle (HF) pigmentary unit is a wonderful tissue for studying mechanisms generally regulating aging, often before this becomes evident elsewhere in the body. Given that follicular melanocytes (unlike those in the epidermis) are regulated by the hair growth cycle, this cycle is likely to impact the process of aging in the HF pigmentary unit. The formal identification of melanocyte stem cells in the mouse skin has spurred a flurry of reports on the potential involvement of melanocyte stem cell depletion in hair graying (i. e., <b>canities).</b> Caution is recommended, however, against simple extrapolation of murine data to humans. Regardless, hair graying in both species is likely to involve an age-related imbalance in the tissue's oxidative stress handling that will impact not only melanogenesis but also melanocyte stem cell and melanocyte homeostasis and survival. There is some emerging evidence that the HF pigmentary unit may have regenerative potential, even after it has begun to produce white hair fibers. It may therefore be feasible to develop strategies to modulate some aging-associated changes to maintain melanin production for longer. The full-text of this chapter will be released for public view {{at the end of the}} publisher embargo in Jan 2017...|$|E
40|$|Hair {{plays an}} {{important}} role in human social and sexual communication. The androgen-stimulated, patterned loss of hair in cases of androgenetic alopecia (or common baldness) in genetically pre-disposed individuals, is associated with ageing and can cause marked phychological distress. However, it is poorly controlled. To investigate the effectiveness of daily topical application of a Chinese medicine-derived herbal mixture, Xiantene, on balding progression, two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (3 and 12 months) were carried out on balding men using the trichogram approach. Xiantene significantly increased both the total number of hairs and those in anagen, improving the ratio of anagen:telogen hairs. This suggests that topical Xiantene increased the length of the anagen phase and may promote a cessation, or partial reversal, of the progression of androgenetic alopecia in men. <b>Canities,</b> loss of scalp hair colour, is another mark of ageing. To investigate whether early greying may protect follicles from androgenetic alopecia, the extent of alopecia, assessed using the Hamilton scale, was compared between men who first became grey before, or after, 30. Both alopecia and greying increased with age in 843 men (217 European, 626 Thai) whenever they first started greying. However, men who showed greying before 30 were significantly less bald, though more grey, in both groups. Hair follicle melanocytes synthesise the pigment melanin, producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress; losing melanocyte pigmentary activity, and therefore these toxic factors, appears to enable hair follicles to maintain their full size for longer, despite the androgen drive to miniaturisation.

40|$|Skin {{and hair}} phenotypes are {{powerful}} cues in human communication. They impart much information, not least about our racial, ethnic, health, {{gender and age}} status. In {{the case of the}} latter parameter, we experience significant change in pigmentation in our journey from birth to puberty and through to young adulthood, middle age and beyond. The hair follicle pigmentary unit is perhaps one of our most visible, accessible and potent aging sensors, with marked dilution of pigment intensity occurring long before even subtle changes are seen in the epidermis. This dichotomy is of interest as both skin compartments contain melanocyte subpopulations of similar embryologic (i. e., neural crest) origin. Research groups are actively pursuing the study of the differential aging of melanocytes in the hair bulb versus the epidermis and in particular are examining whether this is in part linked to the stringent coupling of follicular melanocytes to the hair growth cycle. Whether some follicular melanocyte subpopulations are affected, like epidermal melanocytes, by UV irradiation is not yet clear. A particular target of research into hair graying or <b>canities</b> {{is the nature of the}} melanocyte stem compartment and whether this is depleted due to reactive oxygen species-associated damage, coupled with an impaired antioxidant status, and a failure of melanocyte stem cell renewal. Over the last few years, we and others have developed advanced in vitro models and assay systems for isolated hair follicle melanocytes and for intact anagen hair follicle organ culture which may provide research tools to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of hair follicle pigmentation. Long term, it may be feasible to develop strategies to modulate some of these aging-associated changes in the hair follicle that impinge particularly on the melanocyte populations...|$|E
40|$|Background: In Japan, {{there have}} been no {{substantial}} studies of social function and physical aging in adults with Down syndrome. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine social functions (movement, conversation, and daily living skills) and physical signs of aging in adults with Down syndrome in Japan, and to analyze the relationship between changes in social function and age. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of persons with Down syndrome who were 15 years of age or older (15 - 65 years old) was conducted. The survey was conducted in patients associations, institutes, group homes, and workplaces from July to December 2009. Primary caregivers, such as family members and institute staff, were asked to complete a questionnaire on the subjects’ living situation, movement ability, conversational skills, daily living skills, and 10 characteristics of physical aging at the time of the survey. Results: The total number of subjects was 315. Subjects’ movement ability, conversational ability, and daily living skills declined as a function of age. <b>Canities</b> (40. 6 %) were the most prevalent physical sign of aging, followed by missing teeth, hump back, and skin wrinkling. Further, physical aging was related to a decline in social functions (p < 0. 001). Conclusion: The present study showed that adults with Down syndrome exhibit signs of physical aging earlier than do the general population, and that physical aging is associated with social functioning. Thus, the appearance of physical aging might indicate a decline in social functioning. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 664 号 学位授与年月日:平成 26 年 3 月 20 日Author: Morifuji Kanako, Matsumoto Tadashi, Kondoh Tatsuro, Nagae Masaharu, Sasaki Noriko, Miyahara Harumi, Honda Sumihisa, Tanaka Goro, Moriuchi Hiroyuki, Nakane HideyukiCitation: Acta medica Nagasakiensia, 58 (4), pp. 113 - 118; 201...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAntioxidants {{specifically}} {{addressed to}} mitochondria {{have been studied}} {{to determine if they}} can decelerate senescence of organisms. For this purpose, a project has been established with participation of several research groups from Russia and some other countries. This paper summarizes the first results of the project. A new type of compounds (SkQs) comprising plastoquinone (an antioxidant moiety), a penetrating cation, and a decane or pentane linker has been synthesized. Using planar bilayer phospholipid membrane (BLM), we selected SkQ derivatives with the highest permeability, namely plastoquinonyl-decyl-triphenylphosphonium (SkQ 1), plastoquinonyl-decyl-rhodamine 19 (SkQR 1), and methylplastoquinonyldecyltriphenylphosphonium (SkQ 3). Anti- and prooxidant properties of these substances and also of ubiquinonyl-decyl-triphenylphosphonium (MitoQ) were tested in aqueous solution, detergent micelles, liposomes, BLM, isolated mitochondria, and cell cultures. In mitochondria, micromolar cationic quinone derivatives were found to be prooxidants, but at lower (sub-micromolar) concentrations they displayed antioxidant activity that decreases in the series SkQ 1 =SkQR 1 >SkQ 3 >MitoQ. SkQ 1 was reduced by mitochondrial respiratory chain, i. e. it is a rechargeable antioxidant. Nanomolar SkQ 1 specifically prevented oxidation of mitochondrial cardiolipin. In cell cultures, SkQR 1, a fluorescent SkQ derivative, stained only one type of organelles, namely mitochondria. Extremely low concentrations of SkQ 1 or SkQR 1 arrested H 2 O 2 -induced apoptosis in human fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Higher concentrations of SkQ are required to block necrosis initiated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the fungus Podospora anserina, the crustacean Ceriodaphnia affinis, Drosophila, and mice, SkQ 1 prolonged lifespan, being especially effective at early and middle stages of aging. In mammals, the effect of SkQs on aging was accompanied by inhibition of development of such age-related diseases and traits as cataract, retinopathy, glaucoma, balding, <b>canities,</b> osteoporosis, involution of the thymus, hypothermia, torpor, peroxidation of lipids and proteins, etc. SkQ 1 manifested a strong therapeutic action on some already pronounced retinopathies, in particular, congenital retinal dysplasia. With drops containing 250  nM SkQ 1, vision was restored to 67 of 89 animals (dogs, cats, and horses) that became blind because of a retinopathy. Instillation of SkQ 1 -containing drops prevented the loss of sight in rabbits with experimental uveitis and restored vision to animals that had already become blind. A favorable effect of the same drops was also achieved in experimental glaucoma in rabbits. Moreover, the SkQ 1 pretreatment of rats significantly decreased the H 2 O 2 or ischemia-induced arrhythmia of the isolated heart. SkQs strongly reduced the damaged area in myocardial infarction or stroke and prevented the death of animals from kidney ischemia. In p 53 −/− mice, 5  nmol/kg×day SkQ 1 decreased the ROS level in the spleen and inhibited appearance of lymphomas to the same degree as million-fold higher concentration of conventional antioxidant NAC. Thus, SkQs look promising as potential tools for treatment of senescence and age-related diseases...|$|E
40|$|Ageing is {{a complex}} process that {{involves}} cellular senescence, a gradual loss of tissue homeostasis, and decline in organ function. Abundant evidence implicates mitochondria in ageing suggesting: (i) accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage, (ii) progressive respiratory chain dysfunction, and (iii) increased reactive oxygen species production. The “Mitochondrial Theory of Aging”, first proposed by Denham Harman in 1972, suggests that damage to mtDNA slowly accumulates with time and causes ageing phenotypes by interfering with bioenergetic homeostasis and/or by loss of cells because of apoptosis and/or cellular senescence. This theory {{is supported by a}} wealth of correlative data, but has remained controversial in the absence of experimental proof. In this thesis, the first mouse model to experimentally address the “Mitochondrial Theory of Aging”, the mtDNA mutator mouse, was used to study how elevated somatic mtDNA mutations might translate to age-related functional changes in the central nervous system. The mtDNA mutator mouse is a homozygous knock-in transgenic mouse model that expresses a proof-reading deficient version of the nucleus-encoded catalytic subunit of mtDNA polymerase-γ (PolgA). The model demonstrates a cause and effect relationship between slowly increasing somatic mtDNA mutation levels and several human-like phenotypes associated with ageing that are manifested much earlier in life. There are few means to track symptomatic stages of brain ageing. Using both prematurely ageing mtDNA mutator mice and normally ageing mice, a molecular link was established between mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal metabolism in the ageing process, resulting in marked increases in brain lactate levels, even before the appearance of overt ageing phenotypes. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) genes responsible for the interconversion of pyruvate-to-lactate, LDH-A and LDH-B, which generate the H and M subunits of the 5 different tetrameric LDH isoenzymes, were analyzed and the isoenzyme composition and activities were found to have changed in favor of pyruvate-to-lactate conversion (Paper I). To correlate the striking increase in lactate with tissue histopathology, the activities of cytochrome c oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase were investigated. Failing respiratory chain function was found in key brain areas of mtDNA mutator mice, and, later in life, in normal mice (Papers I and II). Endurance exercise has been recently found to counteract progeroid ageing in prematurely ageing mice similar to the mtDNA mutator mice. Thus, the effect of diet supplementation with natural ingredients, vitamins, and antioxidants was investigated as an alternative strategy. The lifespan of mtDNA mutator mice receiving the dietary supplement NT- 020 -BV was increased by approximately 12 %. The onset of the progeroid ageing phenotypes, such as <b>canities,</b> alopecia, kyphosis, elongation of ears, reduced body size, and weight loss was also delayed, and the enlargement of organs and sarcopenia were ameliorated. Moreover, locomotion and gait, as well as motor programming were also improved in mtDNA mutator mice receiving an NT- 020 -BV-enriched diet (Paper IV). In addition to developing a premature ageing syndrome, approximately 30 % of mtDNA mutator mice also exhibit stochastic brain malformations, ranging from major local perturbations of brain organization to symmetrical hippocampal and cortical migration disturbances. However, such brain malformations were only seen if heterozygous (PolgAmut/WT) females had been maintained as maternal lineages for several generations. Instead, when wild-type mtDNA was re-introduced by crossing heterozygotes with C 57 Bl/ 6 females, the resulting mtDNA mutator mice had no brain malformations. Furthermore, the reintroduction of wild-type mtDNA also improved fertility and viability of offspring, and also delayed the onset of ageing phenotypes. This suggests that the extent of mtDNA mutation load during embryogenesis may also predict the rate of ageing per se in mtDNA mutator mice (Paper III). In summary, these results support a role for mtDNA mutation load and mitochondrial dysfunction in ageing as well as in neurodevelopment, and show that intervention with diet might combat such mitochondrial deficiencies in ageing...|$|E
