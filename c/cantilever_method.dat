25|$|MTU-20 (Ob'yekt 602) (Tankoviy Mostoukladchik) - T-54 {{converted}} into a bridge-layer tank. It has a twin-treadway superstructure mounted on a modified chassis. Each treadway {{is made up of}} a box-type aluminum girder with a folding ramp attached to both ends to save space while the bridge is in the travel position. The vehicle with the bridge in the traveling position is 11.6 m long. When set up, the bridge is 20 m long. This is an increase of about 62% over that of the older MTU-1. The bridge is launched using the <b>cantilever</b> <b>method.</b> First, the ramps are lowered and fully extended before the treadways are forward with the full load of the bridge resting on the forward support plate during launch. The span is moved out over the launching girder until the far end reaches the far bank. Next, the near end is lowered onto the near bank. This method of launching gives the bridgelayer a low silhouette, which makes it less vulnerable to detection and destruction.|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{for the analysis}} of time-dependent deformations of post-tensioned concrete bridge superstructures which are erected by <b>cantilever</b> <b>methods.</b> The method takes into account any arbitrary creep and shrinkage properties of the concrete, friction between strand and ducts, relaxation of the steel stress, and construction loads. A step-by-step procedure is presented which takes into account the creep of concrete under variable stress, variations in Young's modulus of concrete, and all elastic changes in stress accompanying the construction of additional segments. The analysis method was used to study the effects of variations of the parameters on the long-term behavior of two bridges which were built and designed following quite different criteria. Excellent agreement between measured and computed curvatures and strains were found in the two cases for which experimental data were available. State of Illinois Department of Transportatio...|$|R

30|$|The {{vibrational}} {{properties of}} wood {{are determined by}} the free-free flexural vibration or <b>cantilever</b> vibration <b>methods.</b> On the other hand, for damping materials, these properties are generally determined by the central exciting method. The central exciting method is rarely used for wood. In the present study, we measured the dynamic Young’s modulus (E’) and the loss tangent (tanδ) for the same Sitka spruce specimens by the central exciting (JIS-certificated apparatus), the free-free flexural vibration and the <b>cantilever</b> vibration <b>methods,</b> and compared the results {{from the perspective of the}} fixed condition, vibrational modes and other aspects. A simplified experimental apparatus for measurement using the central exciting method was also designed and constructed. The simplified experimental apparatus and JIS-certificated apparatus were verified by measured values (E′ and tanδ). Measured values obtained by the simplified apparatus closely matched those obtained by the JIS-certificated apparatus. The E′ values obtained by the central exciting method closely matched those obtained by the free–free flexural vibration method. The tanδ values obtained by the central exciting method were higher than those obtained by the free–free flexural vibration method but close to those obtained by the <b>cantilever</b> vibration <b>method.</b>|$|R

40|$|For {{preliminary}} design of tall frames, information regarding stress resultants due to lateral loads is required even before member dimensions are known. For this purpose, the portal and <b>cantilever</b> <b>methods</b> are sought in {{practice for the}} specific reason {{that they do not}} require cross sectional dimensions for the analysis. The conceptual power of these two methods is such that the solution is accepted without demur by the practicing engineers. This paper delineates yet another procedure which throws more light on the evolution process for determining the shear force in the columns of the storey under consideration. The modified analysis propounded gives almost the same answer as that of the improved portal method. The reasoned supposition put forward for the determination of shear is lucid, efficacious, powerful and realistic. The method does not entail much computational effort and redounds to arriving at acceptable terminal moments in beams and columns of the plane frame...|$|R

40|$|Sarajevo. 15 {{years of}} {{experience}} in technical research, software development. As the bridge engineering community sets sails to using longer and longer spans, more and more sophisticated analysis models have {{to be used in the}} design process. For large prestressed concrete bridges built using the incremental launching or free <b>cantilevering</b> <b>methods,</b> this applies mainly to accurately modelling the erection process in time, with considering the different construction stages, the time dependent behaviour (creep and shrinkage), and the required pre-cambering to achieve the design shape after the construction process has been finished. However, the challenges for ultra long-span bridges such as stay cable or suspended bridges with high pylons and slender steel or concrete decks, are mainly related to optimising the stressing sequence of the cables, to the geometrically non-linear behaviour of the structure, and to dynamic problems such as wind-induced vibrations. Addressing these last two topics more in detail is the aim of this contribution. Referring to geometric non-linearity, we realise, that using the linear elastic theory is mostly sufficien...|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} {{measuring}} the flexural rigidity of thin films and laminates is described. The method employs {{the principle of}} the heavy elastica which relates flex-ural rigidity to the deflection of the material under its own weight. Results are presented of tests to determine the stiffness of plastic films and plastic-metal laminates for use in space structures experiments. Tests were performed on untreated and aluminized polyjethylene terephthalatej film, aluminum foil, and laminates of aluminum foil and polyjethylene terephtahlate) film or polypropylene film. The thickness of the materials ranged from 0. 00018 inch (0. 00046 cm) to 0. 00270 inch (0. 00691 cm). The weight effici-ency in flexure is presented, the efficiency of the aluminized polyethylene terephthalate] film (Echo I material) being taken as unity. It has been shown that {{the principle of the}} heavy elastica (including both the heart-loop and the <b>cantilever</b> <b>methods)</b> is valid for such determinations if the material does not have a static electric charge.

40|$|In this study, it was {{demonstrated}} how higher {{load carrying capacity}} with respect to shear and torsion can be shown for road bridges through non-linear finite element (FE) analyses. A prestressed box girder bridge, the Källösund Bridge, was evaluated as a case study. The Källösund bridge is a 45 years old, cast-in-situ concrete bridge with four spans, constructed with the free <b>cantilevering</b> <b>method</b> {{on the west coast}} of Sweden. The case study indicates a substantially higher load carrying capacity for combined shear and torsion, compared to bridge assessment with conventional design methods. In the non-linear analyses of the Källösund bridge, about 40 % higher design bogie load than in the initial structural assessment was reached (B = 250 kN), together with the other design loads in ULS, before a shear failure developed for the studied critical load case. With improvements to the model and with deformation controlled loading, an even higher failure load is likely to be shown. However, non-linear analyses of shear failures in this kind of concrete structures are quite rare, and need to be studied further. Furthermore, the analyses performed need to be complemented for other possible critical sections, and for alternative critical load cases...|$|R
