We demonstrate experimentally that c-axis oriented BaTiO 3 films can be deposited directly on quartz glass and Si substrates using such a process and that the material shows an approximately 5 % expansion of its unit cell volume and approximately 4 times the ferroelectric tetragonal distortion of the bulk crystals. Such a frozen negative pressure results in a Tc value that is approximately 580 K higher than that of bulk single crystals, providing a wide range of operating temperatures for the devices. The present results suggest an approach to producing ferroelectric oxides with unique properties that might be extended to ferromagnetic or superconductor oxides and demonstrate a route to a lead-free ferroelectric oxide for <b>capacitive,</b> ferroelectric <b>memory,</b> and electro-optical devices.

The multi-layer structure is formed by metallic layers separated by an insulator so that non-linear electronic transport (tunneling) between the layers can occur. The suggested memcapacitor shows hysteretic charge-voltage and capacitance-voltage curves, and both negative and diverging capacitance within certain ranges of the field. This proposal can be easily realized experimentally, and indicates the possibility of information storage in memcapacitive devices...|$|R

40|$|Excitable {{cells and}} cell {{membranes}} are often modeled {{by the simple}} yet elegant parallel resistor-capacitor circuit. However, {{studies have shown that}} the passive properties of membranes may be more appropriately modeled with a non-ideal capacitor, in which the current-voltage relationship is given by a fractional-order derivative. Fractional-order membrane potential dynamics introduce <b>capacitive</b> <b>memory</b> effects, i. e., dynamics are influenced by a weighted sum of the membrane potential prior history. However, it is not clear to what extent fractional-order dynamics may alter the properties of active excitable cells. In this study, we investigate the spiking properties of the neuronal membrane patch, nerve axon, and neural networks described by the fractional-order Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model. We find that in the membrane patch model, as fractional-order decreases, i. e., a greater influence of membrane potential memory, peak sodium and potassium currents are altered, and spike frequency and amplitude are generally reduced. In the nerve axon, the velocity of spike propagation increases as fractional-order decreases, while in a neural network, electrical activity is more likely to cease for smaller fractional-order. Importantly, we demonstrate that the modulation of the peak ionic currents that occurs for reduced fractional-order alone fails to reproduce many of the key alterations in spiking properties, suggesting that membrane <b>capacitive</b> <b>memory</b> and fractional-order membrane potential dynamics are important and necessary to reproduce neuronal electrical activity...|$|E

40|$|International audienceResistive Random-Access Memories (ReRAMs, or memristors), are {{attracting}} industry {{attention as}} a new technology to replace Flash nonvolatile memories. ReRAMs make use of resistance switching in metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structures which are subjected to voltage biasing. Up to now, attention was focused on dc resistance transition. Less {{attention has been paid}} to the impedance variation, i. e. to the influence of voltage biasing on ac conductance and capacitance in ReRAM devices. In a recent work on HfO 2 ReRAMs [1], we demonstrated that the capacitance, and more generally the imaginary part of RRAM devices, can also be switched by external bias. This paves the way for the realization of <b>capacitive</b> switching <b>memories,</b> or memcapacitors. Besides digital memory applications, memcapacitors could also be used in a broad range of electronic applications, such as reconfigurable RF circuits. From the fundamental point of view, impedance studies can provide information about conduction mechanisms and related switching phenomena. This work aims to better understand the mechanisms of ac conductance and capacitance variation in ReRAM devices. Studied devices are HfO 2 MIM structures elaborated by atomic layer deposition. Devices are subjected to a constant dc voltage bias, and the impedance (real and imaginary parts) is recorded as a function of time. This allows us to follow kinetics of impedance switching, i. e. of both the ac conductance and the capacitance transition. Measurements are carried out at different frequencies and at different temperatures. The frequency and temperature dependence of the impedance in the high and low resistive states is discussed along ac conduction and polarization models implying intrinsic and bias-induced defects. Study of the capacitance switching time, as a function of bias, brings further information about the generation rate of defects which control impedance transition...|$|R

Flexible Semi-Transparent electronic memory would be useful in coming years for integrated flexible transparent electronic devices. However, attaining such flexibility and semi-transparency leads to the boundaries in material composition. Thus, impeding processing speed and device performance. In this work, we present the use of inorganic stable selenium nanoparticles (Se-NPs) as a storage element and hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) as an insulating layer in two terminal non-volatile physically flexible and semi-transparent <b>capacitive</b> <b>memory</b> devices (2 T-NMDs). Furthermore, a-C:H films can be deposited at very low temperature (< 40 Â° C) {{on a variety of}} substrates (including many kinds of plastic substrates) by an industrial technique called Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD) which is available in many existing fabrication labs. Self-assembled Se-NPs has several unique features including deposition at room temperature by simple vacuum thermal evaporation process without the need for further optimisation. This facilitates the fabrication of memory on a flexible substrate. Moreover, the memory behavior of the Se-NPs was found to be more distinct than those of the semiconductor and metal nanostructures due to higher work function compared to the commonly used semiconductor and metal species. The memory behavior was observed from the hysteresis of current-voltage (IâV) measurements while the two distinguishable electrical conductivity states (â 0 â and â 1 â) were studied by current-time (I-t) measurements...|$|E
40|$|According to ITRS 2. 0 2015, memory {{technologies}} {{will continue to}} drive pitch scaling and highest transistor count. As DRAM products are expected to reach their scaling limits by 2024, and unless some major breakthrough occurs, flash memory is expected to lead the semiconductor industry towards the next revolution in transistor density. Inspired from this fact, this work focuses on molecular flash memories and logic switching molecular networks which, among all emerging technology candidates, are considered particularly promising due to their ability for reduction of size per cell and solution processing (low cost, injection-printing friendly), conceptual compatibility with photonic addressing due to molecular photosensitivity, multilevel storage, high information density, quick write-read operations, low power consumption, mechanical flexibility, bottom-up fabrication logic (overcoming the lithographic patterning constrains), conceptual non-binary data representation and propertiesâ tunability through chemical tailoring. Molecular electronic devices are fabricated via a combination of bottom-up layer-by-layer nanofabrication and self-assembly with CMOS platform lithography {{in order to provide}} a low cost large-scale route towards extension of the functional value of Si-based platforms. Tungsten Polyoxometalates (POM, [PW 12 O 40] 3 - of the Keggin class are being self-arranged both on nanocrystal and hyperstructure level in a rational way resulting in layers of tunable spatial correlation length. The hyperstructures exhibit tunable valence and conduction bands and, hence, adjustable electronic properties directly related to the extent of crystallization of their building blocks. Dimensional crossover-driven insulator-to-semimetal transitions can be enforced in these hyperstructures via tuning the extent of crystallization in solution. Being able to transport or confine charge at will, these hyperstructures constitute ideal candidates for alternative molecule-based solution-printed circuitry components and transistor channels. Hybrid CMOS/molecular memory devices based on the parallel plate architecture are fabricated, characterized and tested. Each memory element contains a planar hyperstructure of molecules (typically several millions) that can store charge having multiple times the charge density of a typical DRAM capacitor. Transition-metal-oxide hybrids composed of high surface-to-volume ratio Ta 2 O 5 matrices and tungsten POMs are investigated as a charge storage composite in molecular nonvolatile <b>capacitive</b> <b>memory</b> cells. Enhanced internal scattering of carriers results in a memory window of 4. 0 V for the write state and a retention time around 10 4 s without blocking medium. Differential distance of molecular trapping centres from the cells gate and electronic coupling to the space charge region of the underlying Si substrate are being identified as critical parameters for enhanced electron trapping {{for the first time in}} such devices. The incorporation of a molecular-friendly blocking oxide that facilitates long term retention while suppressing cross-talking, is performed through realization of a multi-functional oxide stack (SiO 2 /hybrid Ta 2 O 5 -POM transition metal oxide/Al 2 O 3) that takes parallel advantage of photonically-addressed phononic modes to boost information storage and reach molecular states that were previously non-available. A 37 % information density increase is attained via phononic pumping, while the memory window reaches 7. 0 V, corresponding to â¼ 4 Ã 10 ^ 14 cm^- 2 charging nodes able to carry 65 - 195 Î¼Cb/cm^ 2. Ability of multi-state addressing and write speed of 10 ns are being documented for the packed cell. The fabricated high performance non-volatile memories are the first documented CMOS-compatible long term (10 years criterion satisfaction) retention molecular capacitive cell of its kind. Following a different approach, brain-inspired, neural systems performing in networks and data-centric non-Von Neumann processing are among the latest trends for non-conventional approaches in the semiconductor industry. We focus on hybrid molecular-nanoparticle networks that exploit the massive parallelism of designless interconnected networks of locally active components, obviating the need for expensive lithographic steps. Molecular multi-junction networks comprising of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of diam. â¼ 1. 4 nm, electronically linked by means of copper 3 -diethylamino- 1 -propylsulphonamide sulfonic acid substituted phthalocyanine (CuPcSu) molecules are fabricated and studied. When electrons flow through the non-linked nanoparticle arrays, they experience on-site Coulomb repulsion and are strongly localized, with localization length (Î¾= 0. 7 nm). Under dynamic excitation the system undergoes Coulomb oscillations, while the introduction of CuPcSu molecules results in the formation of a network of multiple molecular/Au nanojunctions and conductance increases by 5 orders of magnitude. This switching behaviour functions on reversible red-ox reactions and pushes carriers in a weak localization state. In this state electrons spread over several junctions and all temperature scaled current vs voltage curves, J/T^(1 +Î±) vs eV/kT, collapse in one universal curve, characterizing the network and the extent of its disorder. On the other hand, the strongly non-linear I-V response and negative differential resistance of drop-cast nanojunction 3 -d arrays makes them suitable platforms for logic function exhibition. Common miniaturization bottlenecks such as capacitive crosstalk, are embraced as exploitable physical processes, that can lead to robust computational functionality. The networks can be configured on-flight with pulses as quick as 10 ns to modify their resistance between two discrete levels. Both levels can be addressed real time utilizing patterned nano-electrode pairs and reading voltage of the order of 500 mV. The networks are able to perform as a two-input âthen-ifâ logic gates...|$|E
