30|$|We can {{see that}} the {{relative}} change in the total additional payment surplus is quite substantial (+ 117  % and − 69  %). This {{can be explained by the}} fact that compared to the analysis presented above where we focused on just one input parameter at a time, now all eighteen input parameters are misestimated by 10  % each at the same time. In the pessimistic scenario, the total additional payment surplus decreases only by 69  %, which is quite low compared to the increase of 117  % in the optimistic case. We can thus see that in our current case, a pessimistic estimation of cash in- and outflows leads to a lower change of the total additional payment surplus than an overly optimistic estimation of the respective input parameters does. When taking into account other <b>current</b> sustainability <b>maturity</b> levels for the corporate activities other results may be obtained and other conclusions can be drawn. This can be explained by the following: Depending on the gradient of the convex cash outflow and concave cash inflow functions and the respective starting point on the functions (i.e., <b>current</b> sustainability <b>maturity</b> levels) the same relative change of the input parameters for cash in- and outflows can lead to different results regarding the strength of the change on the output.|$|R

We were able to accompany the instantiation of the Sustainability Maturity Cube and the application of our decision model in an in its branch leading and listed German middle-sized company. To outline how a specific company can transform towards sustainability, we first present the data collection process and then define the corporate activities and their <b>current</b> sustainability <b>maturity</b> levels. To test the robustness of our approach, we perform a sensitivity analysis based on these findings.|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of morphological and histological maturity {{was conducted on}} a representative sub-sample of 98 individuals from a total database of 538 specimens of the spotted ray, Raja montagui. At a histological level maturity, defined {{by the presence of}} spermatozoa in the testes, was achieved by males at a smaller size than functional maturity, described by <b>current</b> <b>maturity</b> scales. Morphological evidence indicates that nidamental gland width, in females and clasper length, in males, are reliable indicators of maturity in R. montagui when related to total length and the physiological histology of the testes. On the basis of these results the development of an objective measure of maturity for rajids is both possible and practical using these structures. In addition, these measurements provide finer resolution of the process of maturation during the life history of both sexes, without a significant increase in data collection effort. A greater degree of reliability than that provided by the partly subjective nature of <b>current,</b> <b>maturity</b> scales is therefore possible, permitting an improvement in the user confidence of rajid maturity data, for fisheries management purposes...|$|E

40|$|The {{capability}} maturity model (CMM), {{developed to}} present sets of recommended practices {{in a number}} of key process areas that have been shown to enhance software-development and maintenance capability, is discussed. The CMM was designed to help developers select process-improvement strategies by determining their <b>current</b> process <b>maturity</b> and identifying the issues most critical to improving their software quality and process. The initial release of the CMM, version 1. 0, was reviewed and used by the software community during 1991 and 1992. A workshop on CMM 1. 0, held in April 1992, was attended by about 200 software professionals. The current version of the CMM {{is the result of the}} feedback from that workshop and ongoing feedback from the software community.

40|$|Due to ICT’s {{ubiquitous}} nature, the IT function holds a strategically {{important role}} in many organizations today. The IT function not only supports day - to - day operations and business continuity, but due to technology’s evolution from role s of automate to informate to transformate, the IT function also plays {{an important part in}} how ICT can enable and facilitate radical organizational change. Therefore, the people assets of the IT function are a key resource that needs to be effectively managed. The principles of Talent Management, which recognizes the differential impact of employees in delivering value to the organization, are examined in thi s white paper. Key talent sources for the IT function need to be identified and recruited; rewarded in line with their performance contributions; developed through appropriate training programmes/schemes, and retained. One approach to determining the effec tiveness of organizations in managing the IT function’s ‘A performers’ is to determine the <b>current</b> <b>maturity</b> of their P eople A sset M anagement (PAM) capabilities. The PAM Critical Capability of IT - CMF is proposed as a useful maturity assessment tool to enabl e organizations to establish roadmaps or action plans to improve the <b>current</b> <b>maturity</b> of strategic workforce management and employment life cycle activities of the IT function. Such increased maturity would improve practices surrounding the identification and management of key talent sources...|$|E

30|$|The R&D {{share of}} the funds is the {{proportion}} of revenue made available for developing immature powertrain components. An assumption {{is made in the}} model that 5.6 % of revenue funds R&D and 75 % of this is allocated to the improvement of these components. The total investment by 2050 is shown in Table  4, though this is in relation to a capped amount of estimated spend to full maturity. The total amount of R&D funds are shared between powertrains according to their relative future profits, a measure of the <b>current</b> powertrain <b>maturity</b> and adjusted to reduce potential future emissions and avoid regulatory penalties. The component {{share of the}} total powertrain R&D spend is determined {{as a function of the}} remaining potential improvement in the component, the contribution of the component to powertrain attributes and the importance of the attributes to the user.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Ever {{since the}} first incarnations of {{maturity}} models, critics have voiced several concerns with these frameworks. Indeed, a lack of model fit and oversimplification {{of the real world}} {{can be attributed to the}} rigidity of these models, which assumes that each organization that uses the framework is equal. This research investigates this fundamental rigidity from an analytics perspective, analysing in casu a focus area maturity matrix targeted at information security. The results show that organizational characteristics influence the maturity framework both in parts and as a whole significantly, concluding that <b>current</b> <b>maturity</b> frameworks have a poor model fit and advising that a maturity framework should account for the differences between the characteristics of their target organizations...|$|E

30|$|In the {{regarded}} case, {{the base}} case scenario {{is characterized by the}} fact that it is economically useful to aim at increasing all of the regarded maturity levels (i.e., <b>current</b> <b>maturity</b> levels located on the left side of the optimum). Hence, the underestimation of the convex cash outflows (leading to a lower gradient of the curve) and the overestimation of the concave cash inflows (also leading to a lower gradient of the curve) lead to a higher value of the total additional payment surplus in the optimum (optimistic case). In contrast, in the pessimistic case, both gradients of the functions increase, causing that the optimum for the estimated parameter values is reached with a lower increase in maturity levels than in the optimistic case.|$|E
