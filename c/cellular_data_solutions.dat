40|$|Abstract—It is not {{uncommon}} for the uplink buffers of <b>cellular</b> <b>data</b> networks to be saturated when the uplink bandwidths are low. This can cause the ACK packets for a downlink TCP flow to be severely delayed. Since existing TCP implementations are ACK-clocked, the downstream flow will suffer significant degradation, causing the downlink to be under-utilized. We present a new TCP variant, called TCP Receiver-Rate Estimation (TCP-RRE), that addresses this problem directly by eliminating ACK clocking. Instead, it uses TCP timestamps to estimate the receiving rate at the receiver, which it then uses to determine the sending rate. We show that TCP-RRE is able to improve download speeds by 2 to 4 times compared to existing TCP variants in both simulation and on real commercial <b>cellular</b> <b>data</b> networks. Our <b>solution</b> is practical because it is compatible with existing TCP implementations, requires no modifications to existing mobile devices, and is thus immediately deployable in existing ISP proxies.

With the {{significant}} increase in <b>cellular</b> <b>data</b> usage, {{it is critical to}} bet-ter understand the characteristics and behavior of <b>cellular</b> <b>data</b> networks. With both laboratory experiments and crowd-sourcing measurements, we investigated the characteristics of the <b>cellular</b> <b>data</b> networks for the three mobile ISPs in Singa-pore. We found that i) the transmitted packets tend to arrive in bursts; ii) there can be large variations in the instantaneous throughput over a short period of time; iii) large separate downlink buffers are typically deployed, which can cause high la-tency when the throughput is low; and iv) the networks typically implement some form of fair queuing policy. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} low-level measurements from a CDMA 2000 1 x <b>cellular</b> <b>data</b> network. The network traces record detailed information about wireless Internet packet data call activity on the network, including mobile station identity, call initiation, burst behaviour, supplementary channel usage, soft handoffs, and call termination. The analysis in this paper focuses on one continuous week-long trace data set, representative of <b>cellular</b> <b>data</b> network activity. The results from the analysis illustrate the burstiness of the packet call arrival process and the diurnal patterns of <b>cellular</b> <b>data</b> users. The results also characterize the activity per cell site, activity per user, data burst activity, user mobility, and the density of cellular network coverage.

For example, we observe that datacard devices contribute a large volume of IP traffic in the data plane, while smartphones introduce significant resource overhead in the signaling control plane.

The algorithm is capable of estimating the movement episodes and classifying the trajectory sequences associated to a stay, a jump or a moving action.
