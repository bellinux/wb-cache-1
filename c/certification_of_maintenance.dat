40|$|A wide {{regulatory}} reform {{is taking place}} world-wide in the continuing airworthiness domain. The major influences for promoting changes in how continuing airworthiness is managed are civil and military aircraft accidents to which fatigue, corrosion, wear, deterioration in ageing aircraft {{and the need for}} regulatory harmonisation of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) signatory states and the military were the contributing factors. Another emerging factor is the conversion of older passenger aircraft to freighters, which brings forth the concern that aircraft are being used in a capacity for which they were not designed. The challenges of the {{regulatory reform}} are acceptance, <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> organizations and personnel, education and training, as well as information sharing and administration. This paper presents both the drivers and challenges in these areas and proposes a related change management framework...|$|E
40|$|In April 2006, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) crashed near Nogales, Arizona. This {{incident}} triggered one of {{the most}} sustained studies into the causes of failure involving Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) together with the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency under the Department of Homeland Security identified many lessons from this mishap. The following pages use the insights provided from the Nogales crash to support a critical review of the most recent FAA guidance on the integration of UAS into the U. S. National Airspace System. The existing version of FAA’s Interim Operational Approval Guidance 08 - 01 addresses many of the problems identified in the NTSB report into this incident. However, we conclude that greater oversight is needed to support the exemptions that are permitted for the provisions within this document. In particular, our analysis questions whether a process that enables the same agency to act as regulator and operator of a UAV can be justified within the National Airspace System especially when Federal Agencies delegate operational responsibility to sub-contractors. It is also argued that the Nogales crash illustrates the need for greater coordination between UAS operational staff and Air Traffic Management in order to improve mutual situation awareness under normal operations but also to support coordination under degraded modes. Finally, it is argued that the existing requirements for the <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> technicians and of maintenance management processes under FAA 08 - 01 should be strengthened beyond those for conventional aviation to avoid the sense of complacency that undermines the safety of UAV operations within the National Airspace System...|$|E

While the USA and the UK share a commitment to evidence-based medicine and maintain traditions in how medicine is practised, the healthcare delivery sys-tems and the process and approaches to profes-sional management in the two countries are quite different.

50|$|Finally in {{the middle}} of the 1980s, with the {{continuation}} of the Cold War and the need to modernize the naval fleet, a decision was made to purchase new frigates with the capacity to operate organic helicopters. At the end of the decade of 1980, the Navy started evaluating both the Kaman SH-2 Seasprite and Westland Lynx as the frigate's on-board helicopters. In August 1988 a group of officers were sent to Plymouth, United Kingdom to undergo the AirEngineer Application Course, at the Royal Naval Engineering College, to start receiving training in aerodynamics, shipborne aeronautical systems, engine maintenance, and the control and <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> all <b>maintenance</b> procedures. In April 1989 the officers continued their training at the HMS Daedalus, and later were divided into two groups and sent to receive their certifications at 829 Naval Air Squadron and 715 Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Navy Air Arm.|$|R

40|$|Current {{methods for}} the {{evaluation}} and selection of a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software component fail to address emergent system safety properties. This can lead to extreme difficulties in the <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> COTS-based safety-critical system development projects. In this paper, we propose a defensible approach to supporting successful use (i. e. evaluation & selection, integration, <b>certification</b> and <b>maintenance)</b> <b>of</b> COTS components within safetycritical applications. Within the approach, applicationspecific safety requirements derived for the expected COTS functionality are used to provide evaluation and selection criteria. Where these requirements cannot be met directly by a candidate COTS component the approach encourages the targeted application of suitably matched mitigation strategies. By addressing safety considerations early and explicitly in the COTS based system development lifecycle this approach facilitates {{the development of a}} structured safety case to support system certification. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: Schindler is {{the second}} largest lift and {{escalator}} manufacturer and service provider in Hong Kong {{and it has a}} very large workforce of about 800 persons and a <b>maintenance</b> portfolio <b>of</b> about 6, 000 lifts and escalators. However, there is a strong competition in the lift and escalator market in Hong Kong with other competitors and Schindler is losing its market share and reputation because of a high and increasing breakdown rate of lifts and escalators and the total work injuries of the lift technicians, thus inducing a high labour cost <b>of</b> <b>maintenance.</b> There are few research projects conducted for the lift contractor to reduce the labour cost <b>of</b> the lift <b>maintenance</b> service. This dissertation will outline the research works which include the setting of aims, objectives, literature review, {{and the use of the}} breakdown rates of lift and the total work injuries statistics of the lift technicians to determine the possible major lift components which have a positive decreasing effect by means of their confirmations of safety inspection (CPSI) to the company design standard and tolerance. After appropriate training of the CPSI program and <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> their <b>maintenance</b> lift technicians, the CPSI program was implemented and monitored at site for 1, 0000 sets of lifts. After a 3. 5 months’ pilot run, the results of its effectiveness were validated by means of the breakdown rate of lifts, the total work injuries of lift technicians and a questionnaire for all the involved participants. Hence, conclusions and recommendations based on this research work can be established. ...|$|R
40|$|Many authors {{agree in}} the {{statement}} that acquiring of certificate for introduced quality system is easier phase than from the phases which will follow. After acquiring of certificate the organizations have relaxation time and somewhere the time of easy dream. And when we wake up, control audits come fast {{and it is time}} to show to auditors what we have done in past period. So, maintenance and continuity in development of the quality system present next phases which many auditors estimate as more significant ones and more difficult from the phase of introduction of the quality system itself. By the appearance of standards from years of 2000 (ISO 9001 : 2000) and 2008 the concept of "continuous improvements" has been introduced in the practice <b>of</b> <b>certification</b> and <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> the quality system. Without such improvements and without work on them the quality system as well as all other things in real life would very soon come to the phase of collapse, i. e. quality characteristic s would start falling on all levels. This work will present results of researches conducted in 204 organizations with introduced quality sy stem as well as their activities carried out or to be carried out in the purpose of provision of constant improvements in their organizations. The work will also present comparison of different views seen by persons responsible for quality (manager for quality) in organization as well as by managers of organization (directors) ...|$|R
