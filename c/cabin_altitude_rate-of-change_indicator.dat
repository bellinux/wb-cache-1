50|$|The <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> of the Boeing 767 is {{typically}} about 7000 ft when cruising at 37000 ft. This is typical for older jet airliners. A design goal for many, but not all, newer aircraft {{is to provide}} a lower <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> than older designs. This can be beneficial for passenger comfort. For example, the Bombardier Global Express business jet can provide a <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> of 4500 ft when cruising at 41000 ft. The Emivest SJ30 business jet can provide a sea-level <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> when cruising at 41000 ft. One study of 8 flights in Airbus A380 aircraft found a median <b>cabin</b> pressure <b>altitude</b> of 6128 ft, and 65 flights in Boeing 747-400 aircraft found a median <b>cabin</b> pressure <b>altitude</b> of 5159 ft.|$|R
5000|$|The {{pressure}} {{inside the}} cabin is technically {{referred to as}} the equivalent effective <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> or more commonly as the <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude.</b> This is defined as the equivalent altitude above mean sea level having the same atmospheric pressure according to a standard atmospheric model such as the International Standard Atmosphere. Thus a <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> of zero would have the pressure found at mean sea level, which is taken to be [...]|$|R
5000|$|Aircraft cabin {{pressure}} is commonly pressurized to a [...] "cabin altitude" [...] of 8000 feet or less. That {{means that the}} pressure is , which is the ambient pressure at 8000 ft. Note that a lower <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> is a higher pressure. The {{cabin pressure}} is controlled by a [...] "cabin pressure schedule", which associates each aircraft <b>altitude</b> with a <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude.</b> The new airliners such as the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 will have lower maximum <b>cabin</b> <b>altitudes</b> which help in passenger fatigue reduction during flights.|$|R
50|$|Well {{below the}} Armstrong limit, humans {{typically}} require supplemental oxygen {{in order to}} avoid hypoxia. For most people, this is typically needed at altitudes above 4,500 m (15,000 ft). Commercial jetliners are required to maintain cabin pressurization at a <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> of not greater than 2400 m. U.S. regulations on general aviation aircraft (that is, non-airline, non-government flights) require that the pilot, but not the passengers, be on supplemental oxygen if the plane spends more than half an hour at a <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> above 3800 m. General aviation pilots must be on supplemental oxygen if the plane spends any time above a <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> of 4300 m, and even the passengers must be provided with supplemental oxygen above a <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> of 4500 m. Skydivers, who are at altitude only briefly before jumping, do not normally exceed 4500 m.|$|R
50|$|In airliners, <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> during {{flight is}} kept {{above sea level}} {{in order to reduce}} stress on the {{pressurized}} part of the fuselage; this stress is proportional to the difference in pressure inside and outside the cabin. In a typical commercial passenger flight, the <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> is programmed to rise gradually from the altitude of the airport of origin to a regulatory maximum of 8000 ft. This <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> is maintained while the aircraft is cruising at its maximum altitude and then reduced gradually during descent until the cabin pressure matches the ambient air pressure at the destination.|$|R
5000|$|Keeping the <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> below 8000 ft {{generally}} prevents significant hypoxia, altitude sickness, decompression sickness, and barotrauma. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{regulations in}} the U.S. mandate that under normal operating conditions, the <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> may not exceed this limit at the maximum operating altitude of the aircraft. This mandatory maximum <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> does not eliminate all physiological problems; passengers with {{conditions such as}} pneumothorax are advised not to fly until fully healed, and people suffering from a cold or other infection may still experience pain in the ears and sinuses. The rate of change of <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> strongly affects comfort as humans are sensitive to pressure changes in the inner ear and sinuses and {{this has to be}} managed carefully. Scuba divers flying within the [...] "no fly" [...] period after a dive are at risk of decompression sickness because the accumulated nitrogen in their bodies can form bubbles when exposed to reduced cabin pressure.|$|R
50|$|The {{designed}} operating <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> for {{new aircraft}} is falling {{and this is}} expected to reduce any remaining physiological problems.|$|R
5000|$|The SJ30 {{is in the}} [...] "light" [...] jet class, and has {{the fastest}} cruise speeds and longest range of any {{aircraft}} in that class. The aircraft can seat up to six passengers plus one pilot. A unique feature of this aircraft is that it maintains a 'sea level cabin' (zero <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude)</b> up to 41,000 ft (due to its 12 psi differential pressure) thereby reducing fatigue due to high <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> on long journeys.|$|R
5000|$|By contrast, the United States {{chose to}} use a pure oxygen {{atmosphere}} for its 1961 Mercury, 1965 Gemini, and 1967 Apollo spacecraft, mainly {{in order to avoid}} decompression sickness. Mercury used a <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> of 24800 ft (...) Gemini used an altitude of 25700 ft (...) and Apollo used 27,000 ft (...) in space. This allowed for a lighter space vehicle design. Before launch, the pressure was kept at slightly higher than sea level at a constant [...] above ambient for Gemini, and [...] above sea level at launch for Apollo), and transitioned to the space <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> during ascent. However, the high pressure pure oxygen atmosphere proved to be a fatal fire hazard in Apollo, contributing to the deaths of the entire crew of Apollo 1 during a 1967 ground test. After this, NASA revised its procedure to use a 40% nitrogen/60% oxygen mix at zero <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> at launch, but kept the low-pressure pure oxygen in space.|$|R

40|$|An {{analytic}} technique {{capable of}} predicting the landing characteristics of proposed aircraft configurations {{in the early}} stages of design was developed. In this analysis, a linear pilot-aircraft closed loop model was evaluated using experimental data generated with the NT- 33 variable stability in-flight simulator. The pilot dynamics are modeled as inner and outer servo loop closures around aircraft pitch attitude, and <b>altitude</b> <b>rate-of-change</b> respectively. The landing flare maneuver is of particular interest as recent experience with military and other highly augmented vehicles shows this task to be relatively demanding, and potentially a critical design point. A unique feature of the pilot model is the incorporation of an internal model of the pilot's desired flight path for the flare maneuver...|$|R
2500|$|Airbus {{says that}} the new design {{provides}} a better cabin atmosphere with 20% humidity, a typical <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> at or below [...] and an airflow management system that adapts cabin airflow to passenger load with draught-free air circulation.|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} {{of comfort and}} well-being during a flight {{is the result of}} a wide range of physical effects including, noise, vibration, acceleration, motion, heating, lighting, etc, as well as the hypobaric environment. The inter-relationship of these factors can be complex and must be considered together in the cabin environment. When considering limits and standards for comfort and well-being, it is essential that appropriate scientific and experimental evidential data are used rather than speculative thinking. Questionnaire results must be interpreted with caution. Due to space constraints, only the {{question of}} <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> is considered in this paper. There are insufficient evidential data to support any change to the current maximum certification <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> limit in normal operations...|$|R
50|$|Most {{commercial}} aircraft that operate at high flight altitudes are pressurized at a maximum <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> of approximately 8,000 feet. On most pressurized aircraft, if cabin pressurization is lost when the <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> is above 14,000 feet, compartments containing the oxygen masks will open automatically, either above or {{in front of}} the passenger and crew seats, and the oxygen masks will drop down {{in front of the}} passenger. Oxygen masks may also drop on extremely rough landings or during severe turbulence if the oxygen mask panel becomes loose. Rows of seats typically have an extra mask (i.e. 3 seats, 4 masks), in case someone has an infant in their lap, or someone in the aisle needs to grab one.|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{aircraft}} flight {{represents a}} highly variable altitude exposure {{that may result}} in significant hypoxemia even for the healthy subjects. We measured the arterial oxygen saturation by Nonin finger pulse oximeters (%SpO 2) in three healthy adults (two men and one woman) on regularly scheduled seven domestic commercial flights in Japan to study the correlation between <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> and hypoxemia. For each flight, following data were recorded : date, airline, type of aircraft, flight altitude (either as announced over the aircraft public address system or obtained from the flight crew after arrival), departure airport, and arrival airport. Inflight <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> and <b>cabin</b> pressure was continuously observed and peak values were manually recorded from a commercially available altimeter (Protrek, made by Casio Co.

The mean %SpO 2 on flights decreased to 92. 0 % from 97. 1 % before departure. The passengers even in the commercial aircraft flight must pay attension about air travel hypoxemia...|$|R

2500|$|The {{pressurisation}} {{system was}} driven by a Rotol supercharger attached to the left-hand engine (this was {{the difference between the}} Merlin 76 and 77), providing a constant pressure of [...] over the exterior pressure. This resulted in an apparent <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> of [...] when the aircraft was operating at its design altitude of [...] This <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> was still too high for normal breathing, so the pilot had to wear an oxygen mask during flight. A rubber gasket filled with the pressurized air sealed the canopy when the system was turned on, and a valve ensured the pressure was controlled automatically. Moreover, the pilot also had to wear a high altitude suit as he might have been required to bail out at altitude.|$|R
50|$|A 2003 {{flight of}} a Boeing 737 between Marseilles and London Gatwick {{showed that a}} cabin-wide {{pressurization}} fault can go unrecognized by the flight crew. A problem was first noticed when the crew began to feel some discomfort in their ears. This was shortly followed by the <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> warning horn which indicated that the <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> had exceeded 10,000 feet and this was seen to continue to climb on the cockpit gauge. At the same time, the primary AUTO mode of the pressure control failed, shortly followed by the secondary STBY mode. The crew selected the first manual pressure control mode, but were unable to control the <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude.</b> An emergency descent and subsequent diversion to Lyon was carried out. The failure of the pressurization control system was traced to burnt electrical wiring in the area aft of the aft cargo hold. The wiring loom had been damaged by abrasion with either a p-clip or 'zip' strap that, over time, exposed the conductors, leading to short circuits and subsequent burning of the wires. There was no other damage. The wiring for all the modes of operation of the rear outflow valve, {{in addition to other}} services, run through this loom.|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{technology}} developed at NASA s Kennedy Space Center, pilots now have a hand-held personal safety device to warn them of potentially dangerous or deteriorating <b>cabin</b> pressure <b>altitude</b> conditions before hypoxia becomes a threat. The Personal <b>Cabin</b> Pressure <b>Altitude</b> Monitor and Warning System monitors cabin pressure to determine when supplemental oxygen should be used according to Federal Aviation Regulations. The device benefits both pressurized and nonpressurized aircraft operations - warning pressurized aircraft when the required safe <b>cabin</b> pressure <b>altitude</b> is compromised, and reminding nonpressurized aircraft when supplemental oxygen is needed...|$|R

50|$|The {{aircraft}} involved was a Boeing 737-3H4 N387SW, {{serial number}} 26602, operating a scheduled flight between Nashville, Tennessee (KBNA), and Baltimore, Maryland (KBWI). The aircraft {{took off and}} climbed for about 25 minutes, leveling off at a cruising altitude of approximately 35,000 ft. At about 5:45 pm Eastern Standard Time, the <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> warning activated in the cockpit, indicating a dangerous drop in cabin pressure. The captain disengaged the autopilot and began an emergency descent to bring the aircraft down into denser air to prevent passenger hypoxia. The <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> alarm ceased as the aircraft passed through about 9,000 ft. The flight crew then landed the aircraft safely at CRW. After landing, the aircraft {{was found to have}} a three-sided hole in the fuselage, 17.4 in long, and between 8.6 to(-) 11.5 in wide, forward of {{the leading edge of the}} vertical stabilizer, at the rear end of the aircraft.|$|R
500|$|On 14 March 1961, a B-52F from Mather AFB, California {{carrying}} two nuclear weapons experienced an uncontrolled decompression, necessitating a descent to 10,000feet {{to lower the}} <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude.</b> Due to increased fuel consumption at the lower altitude and unable to rendezvous with a tanker in time, the aircraft ran out of fuel.

5000|$|Before 1996, {{approximately}} 6,000 large commercial transport airplanes were type-certificated to fly up to 45000 ft {{without having}} to meet high-altitude special conditions. In 1996, the FAA adopted Amendment 25-87, which imposed additional high-altitude cabin pressure specifications for new-type aircraft designs. Aircraft certified to operate above 25000 ft [...] "must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to <b>cabin</b> pressure <b>altitudes</b> in excess of 15000 ft after any probable failure condition in the pressurization system". In {{the event of a}} decompression which results from [...] "any failure condition not shown to be extremely improbable", the plane must be designed such that occupants will not be exposed to a <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> exceeding 25000 ft for more than 2 minutes, nor to an altitude exceeding 40000 ft at any time. [...] In practice, that new Federal Aviation Regulations amendment imposes an operational ceiling of 40000 ft on the majority of newly designed commercial aircraft. [...] Aircraft manufacturers can apply for a relaxation of this rule if the circumstances warrant it. In 2004, Airbus acquired an FAA exemption to allow the <b>cabin</b> <b>altitude</b> of the A380 to reach 43,000 ft {{in the event of a}} decompression incident and to exceed 40,000 ft for one minute.
