Cargo can be moved on or off of an oil tanker in several ways. One method is for the ship to moor alongside a pier, connect with <b>cargo</b> <b>hoses</b> or marine loading arms. Another method involves mooring to offshore buoys, such as a single point mooring, and making a cargo connection via underwater <b>cargo</b> <b>hoses.</b> A third method is by ship-to-ship transfer, also known as lightering. In this method, two ships come alongside in open sea and oil is transferred manifold to manifold via flexible hoses. Lightering is sometimes used where a loaded tanker is too large to enter a specific port.|$|R
