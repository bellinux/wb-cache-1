The research process consisted of a literature review that analysed international literature and where available, literature pertaining to the South Africa, focusing on objectives, outcomes, limitations and enablers of <b>corporate</b> <b>venture</b> capital investments in other markets. Twelve unstructured interviews were conducted with <b>corporate</b> <b>venture</b> capitalists, entrepreneurs and independent venture capitalists. Ethical compliance was observed during every interview, ensuring that the integrity of the data was maintained. The data was analysed with the assistance of computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS). The research found that the <b>corporate</b> <b>venture</b> capital market in South Africa is underdeveloped in comparison to international markets. There are no distinct strategies employed by those individuals interviewed. However, the outcomes, objectives, limitations and enablers were similar to those in international markets. A framework has been suggested to assist <b>corporate</b> <b>venture</b> capital investors in South Africa, ensuring that they are aware of the objectives, outcomes, limitations and enablers that they could encounter when performing <b>corporate</b> <b>venture</b> capital investments.

5000|$|Utilities have {{traditionally}} been businesses where the customer is the regulator rather than the rate-payer using the service. This has traditionally meant innovation, including {{through the use of}} <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing,</b> has been of lower priority than gaining market share and pricing power unless required by regulatory action. <b>Corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> at utilities, therefore, has historically been more pro-cyclical to the economic than other industry sectors. [...] However, telecom operators in particular, such as Deutsche Telekom's T-Venture and formerly France Telecom's Innovacom, have built up a successful track record through at least one economic cycle and an increasing number of utilities across the electric, gas and phone industries have started to increase their use of external innovation and <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing.</b> Korea Telecom in July 2010 set up a KRW1 trillion (US$830m) <b>corporate</b> <b>venturing</b> fund, the largest announced fund since the technology, media and telecoms bubble burst in 2000 and 2001.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{there is}} a {{continuous}} need for many corporations to renew their business portfolio strategically in anticipation {{of changes in the}} business environment (e. g., technological change). The ongoing booming of founding international start-ups suggests that small entrepreneurial teams are an effective means to develop new businesses. Corporations should be able to benefit from this form of self-organized innovation when entering novel business domains for strategic renewal. However, corporations that establish small entrepreneurial teams (<b>corporate</b> <b>ventures)</b> are facing two obstacles. First, <b>corporate</b> <b>ventures</b> often fail for reasons that are not well explored. Second, it remains unclear how the partial successes may be improved to large successes. Although the key success factors remain ambiguous, there is little hope that <b>corporate</b> <b>ventures</b> will be successful without effective management.

40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on the {{potential}} strategic benefits to <b>corporate</b> <b>venture</b> capital, i. e. equity investments in entrepreneurial ventures by incumbent firms. In particular, we ask do firms that invest <b>corporate</b> <b>venture</b> capital learn about and appropriate new technologies and practices from those ventures they invest? Our investigation builds on two theoretical pillars. First, that incumbent firms operating in competitive markets are inclined towards introducing innovations. Second, that the knowledge necessary to generate innovation may likely reside outside the boundary of the incumbent firm and in entrepreneurial ventures. Thus, we propose that <b>corporate</b> <b>venture</b> capital programs may be instrumental in harvesting innovations from entrepreneurial ventures and thus an important part of a firm’s overall innovation strategy. To this end, we directly explore the relationship between <b>corporate</b> <b>venture</b> capital and incumbent firm innovation by analyzing a large panel of public firms that pursued venturing activity or patented over a thirty-year period. We find that increases in <b>corporate</b> <b>venture</b> capital investments are associated with subsequent increases in firm quality patenting.

We find that <b>corporate</b> <b>venture</b> capital firms actively contribute to their portfolio companies, rather than simply invest in companies with higher quality or co-invest with other prominent venture capitalists. Our results indicate that con icts of interest might arise in the presence of a strategic overlap between the parent firm of the <b>corporate</b> <b>venture</b> capitalist and the portfolio company.
