40|$|During {{combined}} cataract extraction and {{intraocular lens}} insertion in eyes undergoing removal of silicone oil, {{we noted that}} oil became adherent to the implant. This adhesion persisted post-operatively. Although patients seemed not to be symptomatic {{as a result of}} this effect, the oil interferes with the fundal examination. Since heparin-coated intraocular lenses are more hydrophilic than unmodified lenses, oil should spread less well on these lenses and therefore be less adherent. This study was conducted to test this hypothesis. Heparin-surface-modified and unmodified polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) lenses were immersed in 1000 <b>centistoke</b> neat silicone oil and in an emulsion of silicone oil taken from a patient. The lenses were washed with saline solution in an attempt to remove adherent oil. The lenses were photographed for examination and qualitative comparison. It was found that both neat and emulsified silicone oil was strongly adherent to both surface-modified and unmodified lenses, and could not easily be washed off. The heparin-coated lenses showed a tendency for adherence of emulsified oil. It is concluded that heparin coating of intraocular lenses does not prevent, though may reduce, oil adherence. We recommend that care be taken to avoid contact between oil and implant during combined oil removal and cataract extraction. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Cryo-irrigation was performed by a cooling machine and pump, which circulated cold 200 / 10 <b>centistoke</b> (cSt) silicone through the knee joint of rabbits anaesthetised with intravenous (IV) 'Saffan'. Fluid left the joint at - 5 to - 10 degrees C. Sixteen normal New Zealand rabbits received cryo-irrigation of one knee joint for 10 - 20 minutes and were killed at one day, and one, two, and 12 weeks thereafter. Judged by radioactive sulphate incorporation there was no impairment of chondrocyte function in the articular cartilage of irrigated joints. Histological examination showed mild synovitis and some loss of staining of superficial cartilage in 6 / 16 irrigated joints (v 1 / 16 control joints). Similar treatment of rabbit joints in which the Glynn model of synovitis had been induced showed marked reduction of synovitis 14 - 45 days after silicone treatment. Nine of 26 animals in which synovitis was induced in both knees and cryo-irrigation performed in one knee died either immediately postoperatively or during the next week. These deaths remain unexplained.

Experimental {{results are presented}} {{for a study of}} the effects of time-dependent heating on Benard convection, where the fluids were 5 <b>centistoke</b> (cs), 100 cs and 500 cs viscosity grades of silicone oil. Fluid layer depths were 0. 00635 m, 0. 01270 m and 0. 01905 m. For each run the heat flux at the lower surface was approximately constant, which in dimensionless units was between [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ]. The study examined the effects of different heating rates on the onset of convection, the change of the Rayleigh number with time and the development of motion. Visual observations were made from shadowgraph images, which were recorded photographically. A supplementary analytical analysis of the onset of motion was performed. The results of the work support the trends of the critical time data found in the experiments. On the basis of the experimental results the conculsions are that as the heat flux at the lower surface is increased, the temperature difference required for the initiation of convection increases while the time to the onset of motion decreases. For the higher heating rates a "new" small closed cell pattern is observed shortly after the onset of motion. This pattern does not appear in the steady-state system. Because of the "large" (approximately greater than 100) Prandtl number, specifying the time and the heat flux at the lower surface is sufficient to characterize the state of the fluid layer...|$|R

Methods: Records were reviewed of all patients with a decrease in visual acuity of at least 3 Snellen lines from best acuity with 5000 <b>centistoke</b> silicone oil in place or after removal of silicone oil at a single retina-only practice between 1996 and 2006. Results: Nine patients (6 men, 3 women) {{with a mean age of}} 48 years (range, 16 &ndash; 61) met study inclusion criteria. Seven patients lost at least three Snellen lines of vision while the silicone oil was in place.

The standard is listed under number 8217, with recent updates in 2005 and 2010. The standard divides fuels into residual and distillate fuels.

[...] The {{differences between the two}} are mainly the density and viscosity, with RMG generally being delivered at 380 <b>centistokes</b> or less, and RMK at 700 <b>centistokes</b> or less. Ships with more advanced engines can process heavier, more viscous, and thus cheaper, fuel. Governing bodies (i.e., California, European Union) around the world have established Emission Control Areas (ECA) which limit the maximum sulfur of fuels burned in their ports to limit pollution, reducing the percentage of sulfur and other particulates from 4.5% m/m to as little as [...]10% as of 2015 inside an ECA. As of 2013 3.5% continued to be permitted outside an ECA, but the International Maritime Organization has planned to lower the sulfur content requirement outside the ECA's to 0.5% m/m by 2020. This is where Marine Distillate Fuels and other alternatives to use of heavy bunker fuel come into play. They have similar properties to diesel #2, which is used as road diesel around the world.

Cooling correlation parameters were determined by means of dimensional analysis, and the generalized results for both the inner- and outer-race bearing operating temperatures are compared for the laboratory test rig and the turbojet engine. Inner- and outer-race cooling-correlation curves were obtained for the turbojet-engine turbine-roller bearing with the same inner- and outer-race correlation parameters and exponents as those determined for the laboratory test-rig bearing. The inner- and outer-race turbine roller-bearing temperatures may be predicted from a single curve, regardless of variations in speed, load, oil flow, oil inlet temperature, oil inlet viscosity, oil-jet diameter or any combination of these parameters. The turbojet-engine turbine-roller-bearing inner-race temperatures were 30 to 60 F greater than the outer-race-maximum temperatures, the exact values depending on the operating condition and oil viscosity; these results are {{in contrast to the}} laboratory test-rig results where the inner-race temperatures were less than the outer-race-maximum temperatures.
