50|$|Solid rivets {{are one of}} {{the oldest}} and most {{reliable}} types of fasteners, having been found in archaeological findings dating back to the Bronze Age. Solid rivets consist simply of a shaft and head that are deformed with a hammer or rivet gun. A rivet compression or crimping tool can also deform this type of rivet. This tool is mainly used on rivets close to the edge of the fastened material, since the tool is limited by the depth of its frame. A rivet <b>compression</b> <b>tool</b> does not require two people, and is generally the most foolproof way to install solid rivets.|$|E
50|$|Audio {{and video}} coding changes {{are some of}} the {{additional}} technological updates added to the standard. The adoption of Recommendation ITU-T H.264 (MPEG-4 AVC, Advanced Video Coding) as the <b>compression</b> <b>tool</b> allowed for a great leap in quality in all applications: from high definition to low resolution videos. The High Profile is the video compression profile adopted for SDTV and HDTV signals, while the Baseline Profile is used for 1-Seg content. Differently from the Japanese system, the coding level specified for the Brazilian system allows the deliver of low resolution video content of up to 30 frame/s for portable receivers. Audio coding has also seen improvements in the Brazilian specifications. The choice for the MPEG-4 AAC standard combines greater performance and flexibility with low signaling overhead.|$|E

50|$|WinZip 1.0 was {{released}} in April 1991 as a graphical user interface (GUI) front-end for PKZIP. Earlier in January 1991 Nico Mak Computing released a GUI front-end for OS/2 Presentation Manager called PMZIP. It used the OS/2 versions of the PKWARE, Inc. PKZIP and PKUNZIP programs. Originally released on CompuServe, availability of WinZip expanded across major online services, including GEnie, Prodigy and other online services. In 1993, WinZip announced the launch of its official support for customers on the Windows Utility Forum, serving over 100,000 members, providing updates and related information. The freely downloadable WinZip soon found itself included in best-selling Windows computing titles as part of companion disks, including the all-time best-selling Windows 3.0 book, Windows Secrets, by Brian Livingston. By 1994, WinZip had become the official and required <b>compression</b> <b>tool</b> used by system operators on CompuServe for forum file libraries.|$|E
50|$|During his career, Corning {{published}} {{at least}} forty articles and five books on topics relating to neurology and psychiatry. He studied {{the theory that}} epileptic seizures {{were the result of}} increased blood flow to the brain. He proposed that reducing the cerebral blood flow would reduce the frequency and duration of seizure activity. To this end, he developed several instruments for the compression of the jugular vein. One of these devices was a fork-like <b>compression</b> <b>tool</b> for immediate treatment of seizures, and another was an adjustable belt-like instrument, sively used for preventing seizures. He later developed this approach in combination with other methods for reduction of cerebral blood flow, such as transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve. This treatment method was abandoned due to its significant side effects, which included slow heart rate, dizziness and syncope. Vagus nerve stimulation has since regained its status as an adjunctive treatment for certain types of epilepsy, especially partial seizures, and also as an adjunctive treatment for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder in adults.|$|E

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{challenges}} facing genomics today is efficiently storing the massive amounts of data generated by next-generation sequencing platforms. Reference-based compression is a popular strategy for reducing the size of genomic data, whereby sequence information is encoded as a mapping to a known reference sequence. Determining the mapping is a computationally intensive problem, and is the bottleneck of most reference-based <b>compression</b> <b>tools</b> currently available. This paper presents the first FPGA acceleration of reference-based compression for genomic data. We develop a new mapping algorithm based on the FM-index search operation which includes optimisations targeting the compression ratio and speed. Our hardware design is implemented on a Maxeler MPC-X 2000 node comprising 8 Altera Stratix V FPGAs. When evaluated against <b>compression</b> <b>tools</b> currently available, our tool achieves a superior compression ratio, compression time, and energy consumption for both FASTA and FASTQ formats. For example, our tool achieves a 30 % higher compression ratio and is 71. 9 {{times faster than the}} fastqz tool...|$|R
30|$|We {{compare the}} {{performance}} of the proposed technique with Zopfli (Alakuijala and Vandevenne 2013), WinZip (2016) and PKZip (2016) algorithms. Google claims that Zopfli produces the highest compression ratio for similar technique. Zopfli uses Huffman coding to replace each value with a string of bits. WinZip and PKZip are the most widely used recent Huffman-based <b>compression</b> <b>tools.</b> In all cases, we took the average output of five runs.|$|R
50|$|While {{standard}} data <b>compression</b> <b>tools</b> (e.g., zip and rar) {{are being used}} to compress sequence data (e.g., GenBank flat files), this approach has been criticized to be extravagant because genomic sequences often contain repetitive content (e.g., microsatellite sequences) or many sequences exhibit high levels of similarity (e.g., multiple genome sequences from the same species). Additionally, the statistical and information-theoretic properties of genomic sequences can potentially be exploited for compressing sequencing data.|$|R
