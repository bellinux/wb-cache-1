40|$|International audienceU-series {{studies in}} oceanic basalts are {{critical}} for understanding <b>melting</b> and <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> in the Earth's mantle. The combined results of a detailed geochemical study of <b>melting</b> and <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> at Theistareykir, northern Iceland, provide {{a strong case for}} <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> via channeled <b>melt</b> flow at an active spreading ridge. It has often been argued, however, that widely used <b>melting</b> and <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> models, which simulate channeled <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> (i. e. fractional and/or dynamic melting), can only partially explain the global U-series systematics in oceanic basalts. As a consequence, more complicated models have been invoked, which suggest different styles of <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> at different depths/pressures in the mantle, so-called “two-porosity models”. Alternatively, diffusion-controlled mechanisms have been proposed. Here we show that U–Th–Pa–Ra systematics in oceanic basalts can indeed be explained by models where melt transport occurs without chemical equilibrium between melt and solid when variations in all three critical melting parameters (residual porosity, upwelling rate of the solid mantle and melt velocity) are taken into account. Melting at ridges requires systematic variation of at least two critical melting parameters, most likely upwelling and <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> rate. <b>Melts</b> generated with increasing lateral distance to the ridge axis are generated with slower upwelling rates and are extracted with lower velocities than melts created closer to the ridge axis. Melting at ocean islands, on the other hand, can successfully be explained by variations in upwelling rate only. Global U-series systematics in OIB originate from superimposed global variations in upwelling velocity due to different buoyancy fluxes and from local variation in upwelling velocity as a function of radial distance to the plume center. The model proposed here is consistent with other geochemical data for oceanic basalts and strongly supports <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> via high-porosity channels as a general means of <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> from the Earth's upper mantle...|$|R

Due to a much faster melt migration in the brittle part of the lithosphere, the melt migration is simulated by instantaneous <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> from an assigned <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> region beneath the ridge axis.

40|$|Many {{unresolved}} {{questions in}} geodynamics {{revolve around the}} physical behaviour of the two-phase system of a silicate melt percolating through and interacting with a tectonically deforming host rock. Well-accepted equations exist to describe the physics of such systems and several previous studies have successfully implemented various forms of these equations in numerical models. To date, most such models of magma dynamics have focused on mantle flow problems and therefore employed viscous creep rheologies suitable to describe the deformation properties of mantle rock under high temperatures and pressures. However, {{the use of such}} rheologies is not appropriate to model <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> above the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, where the mode of deformation of the host rock transitions from ductile viscous to brittle elasto-plastic. Here, we introduce a novel approach to numerically model magma dynamics, focusing on the conceptual study of <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> from an asthenospheric source of partial melt through the overlying lithosphere and crust. To this end, we introduce an adapted set of two-phase flow equations, coupled to a visco-elasto-plastic rheology for both shear and compaction deformation of the host rock in interaction with the melt phase. We describe in detail how to implement this physical model into a finite-element code, and then proceed to evaluate the functionality and potential of this methodology using a series of conceptual model setups, which demonstrate the modes of <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> occurring around the rheological transition from ductile to brittle host rocks. The models suggest that three principal regimes of <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> emerge: viscous diapirism, viscoplastic decompaction channels and elasto-plastic dyking. Thus, our model of magma dynamics interacting with active tectonics of the lithosphere and crust provides a novel framework to further investigate magmato-tectonic processes such as the formation and geometry of magma chambers and conduits, as well as the emplacement of plutonic rock complexe...|$|R

Incompressible two-phase flow governs small scale mantle convection driven by lateral variations in melt content.

Magnesia contents of reconstructed whole rocks correlate positively with NiO and negatively with CaO contents, consistent with variable partial <b>melt</b> <b>extraction.</b> Alumina and Cr₂O₃ contents are broadly positively correlated, suggestive of melt depletion {{in the absence of}} a Cr–Al phase. Garnet modes are high at a given Al₂O₃ content (a proxy for melt depletion), falling about a 7 GPa melt depletion model. These observations, combined with high olivine Mg# and major-element relationships of FeO-poor peridotites (3 GPa (residual FeO content being a sensitive indicator of <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> pressure), and similar high pressures of last equilibration (∼ 4. 2 to 5. 8 GPa), provide multiple lines of evidence that the mantle beneath the central Slave Craton has originated as a residue from high-pressure melting, possibly during plume subcretion. Apparent low melt depletion pressures for high-FeO peridotites (> 7. 5 wt%) could suggest formation in an oceanic setting, followed by subduction to their depth of entrainment. However, these rocks, which are characterised by low SiO₂ contents (< 43 wt%), are more likely to be the result of post-melting FeO-addition, leading to spuriously low estimates of <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> pressures.

In order to accomplish reasonable homogeneity and high porosity, the cross-sectional area of the fibers and the width of distribution thereof need to be small. This article studies two techniques for making fibers. <b>Melt</b> <b>extraction</b> out of a crucible yields filaments with a typical diameter ranging from 50 to 200 mu m, which is too thick. Also patented {{for a long time}} is the extraction from a pendant drop. Even though relatively fine fibers can be manufactured with this method, it never exceeded crucible extraction with respect to industrial importance owing to the low productivity of the process. The present article addresses the drawbacks of both variants of <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> of metallic filaments. Because metallic melts are electrically conducting, the use of magnetic fields allows for contactless process optimization. It is well believed that increasing the extraction speed diminishes the fiber diameter. Being not always true, at least in the case of crucible <b>melt</b> <b>extraction,</b> as indicated by the present findings, however, undesired fluid flow, i. e., turbulence, imposes an upper limit on the rotation rate of the extraction wheel. Application of a static magnetic field leads to both higher wheel speed and thinner filaments. The low productivity of extraction from the molten tip of a rod suffers from the fact that only one melt drawing edge can be used. As the bare rod is problematic with respect to heating its tip in contact with the extraction wheel, it is challenging to melt the entire edge of a sheet.

The primary inputs to the magmatic system that feeds the volcano are a subduction component derived from the subducting old Pacific oceanic lithosphere and its veneer of pelagic sediment, and the overlying peridotitic mantle wedge. Conservative trace elements that are very incompatible during mantle melting are relatively depleted in Raoul lavas indicating a source that has been depleted during an earlier melting event. Major element co-variations indicate magma genesis by 25 % near fractional melting of a mantle source that is weakly depleted (2 % <b>melt</b> <b>extraction)</b> relative to a fertile MORB source. An important influence on the composition of the mantle component is progressive <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> coupled with minimal advection of fresh material into the sub-arc zone followed by <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> from a <b>melting</b> column beneath the spreading centre of an adjacent back arc basin.

Two fluid components can be distinguished, one enriched in large ion lithophile elements inferred to be an aqueous fluid that is continuously added to the ascending melt column and the other a less mobile fluid that transfers Th. A homogeneous subduction-related component of constant composition and magnitude arises if the slab-derived flux migrates from the slab–mantle interface to the sub-arc melting column by repeated episodes of amphibole formation and decomposition its composition is then governed by the distribution coefficients of pyroxene and its magnitude by the degree of amphibole saturation of mantle peridotite.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate the importance of melt migration in shaping major characteristics of geological features associated with the partial melting of the upper mantle, such as sea-floor spreading, continental flood basalts and rifting. The partial melting produces permeable partially molten rocks and a buoyant low viscosity melt. Melt migrates through the partially molten rocks, and transfers mass and heat. Due to its much faster velocity and appreciable buoyancy, melt migration {{has the potential to}} modify dynamics of the upwelling partially molten plumes. I develop a 2 -D, two-phase flow model and apply it to investigate effects of melt migration on the dynamics and melt generation of upwelling mantle plumes and focusing of melt migration beneath mid-ocean ridges. Melt migration changes distribution of the melt-retention buoyancy force and therefore affects the dynamics of the upwelling plume. This is investigated by modeling a plume with a constant initial melt of 10 % where no further melting is considered. Melt migration polarizes melt-retention buoyancy force into high and low melt fraction regions at the top and bottom portions of the plume and therefore results in formation of a more slender and faster upwelling plume. Allowing the plume to melt as it ascends through the upper mantle also produces a slender and faster plume. It is shown that melt produced by decompressional melting of the plume migrates to the upper horizons of the plume, increases the upwelling velocity and thus, the volume of melt generated by the plume. Melt migration produces a plume which lacks the mushroom shape observed for the plume models without melt migration. Melt migration forms a high melt fraction layer beneath the sloping base of the impermeable oceanic lithosphere. Using realistic conditions of melting, freezing and <b>melt</b> <b>extraction,</b> I examine whether the high melt fraction layer is able to focus melt from a wide partial melting zone to a narrow region beneath the observed neo-volcanic zone. My models consist of three parts; lithosphere, asthenosphere and a <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> region. It is shown that melt migrates vertically within the asthenosphere, and forms a high melt fraction layer beneath the sloping base of the impermeable lithosphere. Within the sloping high melt fraction layer, melt migrates laterally towards the ridge. In order to simulate melt migration via crustal fractures and cracks, melt is extracted from a <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> region extending {{to the base of the}} crust. Performance of the melt focusing mechanism is not significantly sensitive to the size of <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> region, <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> threshold and spreading rate. In all of the models, about half of the total melt production freezes beneath the cooling base of the lithosphere, and the rest is effectively focused towards the ridge and forms the crust. To meet the computational demand for a precise tracing of the deforming upwelling plume and including the chemical buoyancy of the partially molten zone in my models, a new numerical method is developed to solve the related pure advection equations. The numerical method is based on Second Moment numerical method of Egan and Mahoney [1972] which is improved to maintain a high numerical accuracy in shear and rotational flow fields. In comparison with previous numerical methods, my numerical method is a cost-effective, non-diffusive and shape preserving method, and it can also be used to trace a deforming body in compressible flow fields...|$|R

Retrograde reaction textures provide the main evidence for trapped melt {{in the rock}} fabrics. Carvalhos Klippe rocks in Southern Brasilia Orogen, Brazil, present a typical high-pressure granulite assemblage with evidence of mica breakdown partial melting (Ky + Grt + Kfs +/- Bt +/- Rt). The metamorphic peak temperatures obtained by Zr-in-Rt and ternary feldspar geothermometers are between 850 degrees C and 900 degrees C. The GASP bane peak pressure obtained using grossular rich garnet core is 16 kbar. Retrograde reaction textures in which the garnet crystals are partially to totally replaced by Bt + Qtz +/- Fsp intergrowths are very common in the Carvalhos Klippe rocks. These reactions are interpreted {{as a result of}} interactions between residual phases and trapped melt during the retrograde path. In the present study the geochemical signatures of three groups of Carvalhos Klippe metasedimentary rocks are analysed. Despite the high metamorphic grade these three groups show well-defined geochemical features and their REE patterns are similar to average compositions of post-Archean sedimentary rocks (PAAS, NASC). The high-pressure granulite facies Grt-Bt-Pl gneisses with immature arenite (wacke, arkose or lithic-arenite) geochemical signatures present in the Carvalhos Klippe are compared to similar rocks in amphibolite facies from the same tectonic framework (Andrelandia Nappe System).

This could be tested by collecting more PGE data from other metasomatised Kaapvaal xenoliths and comparing them to the present data...|$|R
40|$|The initial Nd and Hf isotope {{ratios of}} a 420 Ma post-collisional dioritic-granitic {{batholith}} from the Northern Tibetan plateau define a negative trend above and orthogonal to the ԐHf(t) -ԐNd(t) terrestrial array. This uncommon trend offers {{an insight into}} {{the origin of the}} puzzling Nd-Hf isotope decoupling in the crustal rocks. On this trend, samples depleted in heavy rare earth elements (HREEs, i. e., [Dy/Yb]N ≫ 1) deviate most from the terrestrial array whereas samples with flat HREEs (i. e., [Dy/Yb]N ≥ 1) deviate less or plot within the terrestrial array, pointing to the controlling effect of garnet in the magma source. Ancient garnet-bearing residues after <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> will have elevated Lu/Hf ratios and can evolve with time to produce high ԐHf(t) at a low ԐNd(t) value. Mixing of melts derived from such source lithologies (high Lu/Hf) with melts possessing a within-terrestrial array Nd-Hf isotopic composition (low Lu/Hf) best explains the observed trend orthogonal to the terrestrial array. The samples from the Jinfosi batholith with the most decoupled Nd-Hf isotope compositions require a larger degree (> 40 %) and ancient (i. e., ≥ 1. 8 Gyr) previous <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> from their source. It follows that the ancient melts with depleted HREEs complementary to those garnet-bearing residues should have low ԐHf values and plot below the terrestrial array, which is indeed shown by some Archean/Paleoproterozic TTGs...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} petrologic {{and physical}} aspects of <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> on the parent asteroid of the ureilite meteorites (UPB). We first develop a petrologic model for simultaneous melting and smelting (reduction of FeO by C) at various depths. For a model starting composition, determined from petrologic constraints {{to have been}} CV-like except for elevated Ca/Al (2. 5 × CI), we determine (1) degree of melting, (2) the evolution of mg, (3) production of CO + CO 2 gas and (4) the evolution of mineralogy in the residue {{as a function of}} temperature and pressure. We then use these relationships to examine implications of fractional vs. batch <b>melt</b> <b>extraction.</b> In the shallowest source regions (30 bars), melting and smelting begin simultaneously at 1050 °C, so that mg and the abundance of low-Ca pyroxene (initially pigeonite, ultimately pigeonite + orthopyroxene) begin to increase immediately. However, in the deepest source regions (100 bars), smelting does not begin until 1200 °C, so that mg begins to increase and low-Ca pyroxene (pigeonite) appears only after 21 % melting. The final residues in these two cases, obtained just after the demise of augite, match the end-members of the ureilite mg range (94 – 76) in pyroxene abundance and type. In all source regions, production of CO + CO 2 by smelting varies over the course of melting. The onset of smelting results in a burst of gas production and very high incremental gas/melt ratios (up to 2. 5 by mass); after a few % (s) melting, however, these values drastically decline (to < 0. 05 in the final increments). Physical modelling based on these relationships indicates that melts would begin to migrate upwards after only 1 – 2 % melting, and thereafter would migrate continuously (fractionally) and rapidly (reaching the surface in < a year) in a network of veins/dikes. All melts produced during the smelting stage in each source region have gas contents sufficient to cause them to erupt explosively and be lost. However, since in all but the shallowest source regions part of the melting sequence occurs without smelting, fractional melting implies that a significant fraction of UPB melts may have erupted more placidly to form a thin crust (3. 3 km thick for a 100 km radius body). Our calculations suggest that <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> was so rapid that equilibrium trace element partitioning may not have been attained. We present a model for disequilibrium fractional melting (in which REE partitioning is limited by diffusion) on the UPB, and demonstrate that it produces a good match to the ureilite data. The disequilibrium model may also apply to trace siderophile elements, and might help explain the “overabundance” of these elements in ureilites relative to predictions from the smelting model. Our results suggest that <b>melt</b> <b>extraction</b> on the UPB was a rapid, fractional process, which can explain the preservation of a primitive oxygen isotopic signature on the UPB...|$|R

Additional file 1 : Figure S 1 shows that the overall melting structure remains essentially the same, even when the effects of mantle depletion in major elements are taken into account (cf.
