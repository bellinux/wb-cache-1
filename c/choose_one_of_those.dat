'Despatch reinforcement to Pardubitz; thanks to Nassau, the Kolin-Pardubitz road is ours!' That is done, Pardubitz saved for the moment. Could we now get to Kuttenberg before the old Marshal, his design were overset altogether. Alas, we cannot march at once, have to wait a day for the bread. Forward, nevertheless; and again forward, and again; three heavy marches in November weather: let us make a fourth forced march, start to-morrow before dawn,--Kuttenberg above all things! In vain; to-morrow, 4th November, there is such a fog, dark as London itself, from six in the morning onwards, no starting till noon: and then impossible, with all our efforts, to reach Kuttenberg. We have to halt an eight miles short of it, in front of Kolin; and pitch tents there. On the morrow, 5th November, Traun is found encamped, unattackable, between us and our object; sits there, at his ease in a friendly Country, with Pandour whirlpools flowing out and in; an irreducible case to Friedrich. November 5th, and for three days more, Friedrich, to no purpose, tries his utmost;--finds he will have to give up the Elbe-Sazawa region, like the others. Monday, November 9th, Friedrich gathers himself at Kolin; crosses the Elbe by Kolin Bridge, that day. Point after point of the game going against him." ...|$|E

50|$|While not {{directly}} criticizing Leibniz, Spinoza holds a drastically different view on creation and the universe. Spinoza believes “that everything that God thinks or conceives must also exist”, and he combines God’s will and God’s understanding where Leibniz separates them. In other words, God cannot imagine {{an infinite number}} of worlds and “as a separate act of will” <b>choose</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> to create. How does Spinoza explain creation then? To put it simply, everything in the universe “is a direct result of God’s nature”. The moment God thinks of something, it exists. As there are not an infinite amount of universes (according to Spinoza and Leibniz) God must have only conceived of one universe. This, however, still runs into the problem of the existence of evil. How can God, in his perfection, create a world capable of evil if the world in an extension of his mind? In any case, Spinoza still tries to justify a non-infinite basis for the universe, where reality is everything God has ever thought of.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a model checking technique and tool for UML Statecharts based on automatic white box test-generation combined with automatic run-time monitoring of statechart assertions. The white box test generator is an automatically generated JUnit TestCase, which generates sequences of events, conditions, and input {{data for the}} System Under Test (SUT). It generates test sequences while observing the SUT’s state, knowing the input events, conditions, and data objects that potentially affect the SUT’s next state. The white box tester then <b>chooses</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> events, conditions, and data objects, and fires the SUT, which in turn fires an embedded assertion for run-time monitoring. This combination of white box testing with assertion monitoring constitutes automatic model checking. The white-box tes-generator is also specification based in that the white box can be specified to be requirement assertions. Harel Statecharts and Statechart Specifications Harel statecharts have been described in numerous papers and books since first published by Harel [Ha] and later incorporated into the OMT methodology and eventually into the UML standard, (e. g.

40|$|Population {{projections}} {{can be used}} as a tool {{to provide}} information on possible scenarios of future population and, namely, to support decision-making processes in diverse socio-economic areas, such as, higher education institutional network planning, both in public and private sectors. The dimension and the age and sex composition of future populations are influenced by mortality, fertility and migration trends. So, an accurate estimation of those future trends is crucial to evaluate how many inhabitants we will face in the future and simultaneously to prepare ourselves for their future needs. In a country like Portugal, affected by a severe economical and financial crisis, with a young population characterized by very low levels of education and qualification is fundamental to use population projections as a basis for higher education planning. The main goal of this paper is to evaluate the possible changes in the younger population size in the coming years as a tool to (re) define and (re) design, geographically the higher education institutional network in Portugal. For this purpose, we used the cohort-component method to project the Portuguese population from 2011 to 2036. For the evaluation of mortality future evolution we tested the performance, for the Portuguese case, of both the Lee-Carter (LC) method (1992) and the Booth-Maindonald-Smith (BMS) variant (2002), using data from the Human Mortality Database. Regarding the fertility projection, we used data from the Human   1 Fertility Database and applied the method proposed by Schmertmann (2003 & 2005), to model fertility rates by age. The complexity of migration flows, especially regarding its instability and the difficulties in addressing new forms of population mobility, supported the decision of include only a null migration scenario on this exercise. Considering the relevance of the projection of the number (and sex composition) of the under 18 population, we centered the discussion on the impact of different estimates of the future mortality rates for the youngest. Alongside with the main results, we will focus also on the analysis of the outcomes of LC and BMS models, performing a sensitivity analysis. We will sustain the reasons to <b>choose</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> models as well as the use of confidence intervals to design alternative scenarios. Our findings will provide a range of reliable forecasts to support a more rational political decision contributing to an efficient and effective planning in what concerns higher education requirements adjusted to the future population...|$|E

40|$|Many product categories, from pizzas to real estate, present buyers with {{purchase}} decisions involving complex area judgments. Does {{a square}} look larger or {{smaller than a}} circle? How much smaller does a circle of 8 -inch diameter look when compared to one with a 10 -inch diameter? In this paper, we propose a psychophysical model of how consumers make area comparison judgments. The model involves consumers making effort-accuracy trade-offs that lead to heuristic processing of area judgments and systematic shape- and size-related biases. The model is based on four propositions: P 1. Consumers make an initial comparison between two figures based on a single dimension; P 2. The dimension of initial comparison—the primary dimension—is {{the one that is}} most salient to consumers, where salience is figure and context dependent; P 3. Consumers insufficiently adjust an initial comparison using a secondary dimension, which we assume to be orthogonal to the primary dimension used for the initial comparison; and P 4. The magnitude by which the initial comparison is adjusted {{is directly related to the}} relative salience of the secondary dimension versus the primary dimension. The model predicts that a single linear dimension inappropriately dominates the two-dimensional area comparison task and that contextual factors affect which linear dimension dominates the task. The relative use of the second dimension depends on its relative salience, which can be influenced in a variety of ways. The model extends the area estimation literature in cognitive psychology by exploring new biases in area estimation and is able to resolve controversial effects regarding which shape is perceived to be “bigger,” the square or the circle, by incorporating contextual factors into model specifications. A set of six studies—five laboratory experiments and one field experiment—systematically test model predictions. Study 1 is a process study that shows that when two dimensions are available to make an area comparison judgment, people <b>choose</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> to be the primary dimension, with the other being the secondary dimension. Furthermore, it shows that the choice of the primary dimension is dependent on its relative salience that can be contextually manipulated via manner of visual presentation. Studies 2 and 3 show how the use of a diagonal versus the side of a square (contextually determined) can affect whether a square is perceived to be smaller or larger than a circle of the same area. Study 3 extends the investigation to the domain of the price people are willing to pay for “pizzas” of different shapes, presented differently. Study 4, a field study, demonstrates external validity by showing that purchase quantities are greater when a circular package is expected to contain less than a rectangular package of the same volume in a domain where consumption goal is constant (cream cheese with a bagel). Studies 5 and 6 examine ways in which one can increase the salience of the secondary dimension, in a size estimation task, i. e., judging the rate of increase of area. While Study 5 does so via contextual visual cues (incorporating lines that draw one's attention to the underused dimension), Study 6 does the same using semantic cues that direct attention to a single dimension (e. g., diameter) or the total area and comparing these with a visual presentation of the figure. Overall, results suggest that the manner in which information is presented affects the relative salience of dimensions used to judge areas, and can influence the price consumers are willing to pay. Underlining the external validity of these findings, container shape can significantly affect quantity purchased and overall sales. The paper highlights biases in area comparison judgments as a function of area shape and size. The model is parsimonious, demonstrates good predictive ability, and explains seemingly contradictory results in the cognitive psychology literature. Implications for pricing, product design, packaging, and retailing are suggested. Consumer Behavior, Experiments, Judgment Biases, Package Design, Information Processing...|$|E
