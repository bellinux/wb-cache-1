25|$|The assay is {{performed}} in polypropylene plates with round wells, which {{are commonly used}} in laboratories for culturing eukaryotic cells. The cells are allowed {{to grow in the}} wells overnight, creating a flat layer. Bacteria are separately grown overnight. On the next day the eukaryotic cells are inoculated with the bacteria and are incubated together for an hour. <b>Centrifuging</b> the plates for a few minutes may help bring cells and bacteria in contact and initiate infection.|$|E
25|$|After {{filtering}} {{any remaining}} solids, the clarified syrup is decolorized by filtration through activated carbon. Bone char or coal-based activated carbon is traditionally {{used in this}} role. Some remaining color-forming impurities adsorb to the carbon. The purified syrup is then concentrated to supersaturation and repeatedly crystallized in a vacuum, to produce white refined sugar. As in a sugar mill, the sugar crystals are separated from the molasses by <b>centrifuging.</b> Additional sugar is recovered by blending the remaining syrup with the washings from affination and again crystallizing to produce brown sugar. When no more sugar can be economically recovered, the final molasses still contains 2030 percent sucrose and 1525 percent glucose and fructose.|$|E

However, the {{advantage}} of conical plate <b>centrifuge</b> over chamber bowl <b>centrifuge</b> is that solid discharge is possible in conical plate. The chamber bowl has a high capacity for solids but there is no solid discharge.Bowl cooling is possible for both conical plate <b>centrifuge</b> and chamber bowl <b>centrifuge.</b> However, cleaning is easier as well as better sludge dewatering in chamber bowl <b>centrifuge</b> as compared to conical plate <b>centrifuge.</b>|$|R

50|$|Both conical plate <b>centrifuge</b> and tubular bowl <b>centrifuge</b> can be {{used for}} liquid/liquid and solid/liquid separation. However, the {{advantage}} of conical plate <b>centrifuge</b> over tubular bowl <b>centrifuge</b> is that solid discharge is possible in conical plate but recovery of solids in tubular bowl is difficult and there is limited solid capacity. As the liquid discharge in conical plate <b>centrifuge</b> is under high pressure, this eliminates foaming but foaming is present in tubular bowl <b>centrifuges</b> unless special skimming or centripetal pumps are used. Tubular bowl <b>centrifuges</b> are easier to clean and good sludge dewatering as compared to conical plate <b>centrifuge.</b>|$|R
25|$|In Briggs' first {{professional}} position {{he was put}} in charge of the Physics Laboratory (later the Bureau of Soils) of the US Department of Agriculture. He was one of a new breed of multi-disciplinary scientists studying the biology and ecology of plant life. His research work was concentrated on water retention of soils and he was a founder of the science of soil physics. In 1906 he devised a soil classification technique called the moisture equivalent based on <b>centrifuging,</b> which is now thought of as the first Pedotransfer function. In the same year he also organized a biophysical laboratory that later became the Bureau of Plant Industry. Briggs worked with Homer Leroy Shantz on the effect of environment on the water uptake by plants, and was an early contributor to ecology.|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} {{differences between}} a traditional cask and a keg {{are that the}} latter has a centrally located downtube and a valve that allows beer in and gas out when filling and vice versa when beer is dispensed. Also kegs have a simple concave bottom whilst the barrel or cask design allows sediment to be retained in the cask. This aspect of keg design means that all the beer in the keg is dispensed, which therefore requires that the beer be processed by filtration, fining or <b>centrifuging,</b> {{or some combination of}} these, to prevent sediment formation. Lastly, kegs have straight sides unlike the traditional barrel or cask shape. In order to get the beer out of a keg and into a customer's glass, it can be forced out with gas pressure, although if air or gas at low pressure is admitted {{to the top of the}} keg it can also be dispensed using a traditional hand pump at the bar.|$|E
500|$|PrPC is {{a normal}} protein found on the {{membranes}} of cells. It has 209 amino acids (in humans), one disulfide bond, a molecular mass of 35–36 kDa and a mainly alpha-helical structure. Several topological forms exist; one cell surface form anchored via glycolipid and two transmembrane forms. The normal protein is not sedimentable; meaning that it cannot be separated by <b>centrifuging</b> techniques. Its function is a complex issue that continues to be investigated. PrPC binds copper (II) ions with high affinity. The significance of this finding is not clear, but it is presumed to relate to PrP structure or function. PrPC is readily digested by proteinase K and can be liberated from the cell surface in vitro by the enzyme phosphoinositide phospholipase C (PI-PLC), which cleaves the glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) glycolipid anchor. [...] PrP {{has been reported to}} play important roles in cell-cell adhesion and intracellular signaling in vivo, and may therefore be involved in cell-cell communication in the brain.|$|E

[...] The common practice of reusing needles, not screening for diseases, sellers traveling from station to station with false records to maximize their income, and the mixing the blood prior to <b>centrifuging</b> and re-injecting the separated red blood cells back into the peasant blood-sellers guaranteed the rapid spread of blood-borne diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis B.|$|E
2500|$|The {{centrifugal}} {{refinement of}} the liposuction-harvested adipocyte tissues removes blood products and free lipids to produce autologous breast filler. The injectable filler-fat is obtained by <b>centrifuging</b> (spinning) the fat-filled syringes for {{sufficient time to}} allow the serum, blood, and oil (liquid fat) components to collect, by density, apart from the refined, injection-quality fat. To refine the fat for facial injection quality, the fat-filled syringes are centrifuged for 1.0 minute at 2,000 RPM, which separates the unnecessary solution, leaving refined filler-fat. Moreover, centrifugation at 10,000 RPM for 10 minutes produces a [...] "collagen graft"; the histologic composition of which is cell residues, collagen fibres, and 5.0 per cent intact fat cells. Furthermore, because the patient's body naturally absorbs some of the fat grafts, the breasts maintain their contours and volumes for 18–24 months.|$|E

5000|$|The gas {{centrifugation}} process utilizes a unique design that allows gas to constantly flow {{in and out}} of the <b>centrifuge.</b> Unlike most <b>centrifuges</b> which rely on batch processing, the gas <b>centrifuge</b> utilizes continuous processing, allowing cascading, in which multiple identical processes occur in succession.The gas <b>centrifuge</b> consists of a cylindrical rotor, a casing, an electric motor, and three lines for material to travel. The gas <b>centrifuge</b> is designed with a casing that completely encloses the <b>centrifuge.</b> The cylindrical rotor is located inside the casing, which is evacuated of all air to produce a near frictionless rotation when operating. The motor spins the rotor, creating the centripetal force on the components as they enter the cylindrical rotor.
