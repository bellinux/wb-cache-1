50|$|The Regulations also specify, {{that some}} types of work must be {{undertaken}} by an appropriate qualified professional (such as works on gas or certain electrical matters), or must be notified to the relevant local authority's Building regulations approval for <b>certification</b> <b>or</b> <b>approval.</b> Building regulations are distinct from planning permission; they control how buildings are to be designed or modified while planning permission is concerned with appropriate development, the nature of land usage, {{and the appearance of}} neighbourhoods. Therefore, both must be considered when building works are to be undertaken.|$|E
50|$|Computer-aided {{auscultation}} or computerized assisted auscultation (CAA) is {{a digital}} form of auscultation. It includes the recording, visualization, storage, analysis and sharing of digital recordings of heart or lung sounds. The recordings are obtained using an electronic stethoscope or similarly suitable recording device. Computer-aided auscultation {{is designed to}} assist health care professionals who perform auscultation {{as part of their}} diagnostic process. Commercial CAA products are usually classified as clinical decision support systems that support medical professionals in making a diagnosis. As such they are medical devices and require <b>certification</b> <b>or</b> <b>approval</b> from a competent authority (e.g. FDA approval, CE conformity issued by notified body).|$|E
50|$|Fire {{protection}} products used in {{the construction}} of buildings, ships and offshore facilities are required to conform with the <b>certification</b> listings <b>or</b> <b>approvals.</b> The field installation will comply with code requirements if it is configured within the maximum and minimum tolerances in the listings and approvals. For example, if a drywall assembly has a listing of a 2 hour fire-resistance rating, and all the provisions of the listing were kept in the field, including materials, spacing, workmanship, etc., the 2 hour wall required by the building's designer is likely to withstand a 2 hour fire.|$|R
5000|$|National, {{governmental}} accreditors, such as Germany's Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik or Canada's SCC (Standards Council of Canada) can [...] "accredit" [...] laboratories, {{meaning that}} such laboratories must conform to national standards and {{rules of conduct}} in the discharge of their duties. Compliance is routinely tested by the accreditor through inspections, where random client files are audited {{to see that the}} laboratory followed all appropriate procedures. Accreditors can accredit laboratories for testing, as well as for product certification. In product certification regimes, the laboratory or the accreditor (as in the case of Germany) become involved in witnessing the production of test materials, get copies of process standards, including chemical formulas and all details necessary to manufacture a product. Once the test product is made, it is shipped [...] "under seal" [...] to the laboratory for incorporation in the test. <b>Certification</b> listings <b>or</b> <b>approvals</b> that follow a successful test are subject to the maintenance of continuous factory auditing to make sure that what was tested is identical to that which was made, or documented proof that the products made continue to meet quality control standards set out {{as a function of the}} approvals process.|$|R
50|$|Intumescent dampers may be {{qualified}} to ISO 10294-5:2005 Fire dampers for air distribution systems—Part 5: Intumescent fire dampers. They swell shut due to intumescence {{in the event}} of a fire. Unlike mechanical dampers, it is a physical/chemical reaction that causes the closure to work. Provided the intumescent is within demonstrable ageing and/or shelf life and providing the absence of massive combustible objects (sabotage), the damper is certified to maintain its functionality subject to its <b>certification</b> listing <b>or</b> type <b>approval.</b> In other words, cleaning (when necessary) and an age assessment comprise the inspection. The annulus of an intumescent damper is shut as per its certification listing, such that the intumescent can press against a shut frame to close the opening, thus eliminating annular smoke migration.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to improve pilot {{understanding}} of the Traffic alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) by changing the Traffic Situation Display (TSD). This is supported by two objectives. The first objective {{is to create an}} integrated, realistic air traffic environment. This serves as an experimental platform for testing and evaluating future TCAS TSDs. The simulator environment includes a desktop flight simulator, background air traffic simulator, and intruder aircraft. The intruder aircraft uses seven dimensional waypoints to robustly follow trajectories and cause specific resolution advisories. Second, the relative benefits of, and potential concerns with, new TCAS TSDs are explored using a structured, iterative design process with subject matter ex- perts (SMEs). Incremental changes to the TSD were implemented into the simulator environment. SMEs evaluated the displays and potential points of confusion were identified. Several display features are discussed and implemented for future evaluations. These include boundary lines of TCAS variables depicted on the TSD and on a vertical situation display, speed lines which vary with the TCAS estimate of time to closest point of approach, and a prediction of the safe altitude target during a resolution advisory. Scenarios which may be confusing or misleading are discussed. These scenarios may be ameliorated or exacerbated by display features. This information is useful to guide both design and <b>certification</b> <b>or</b> operational <b>approval</b> and is a starting place for future TCAS experiments.

50|$|Listing and {{approval}} use and compliance is {{the activity of}} adhering to specific testing requirements designed to establish minimum performance for the installation or use of safety-related products and materials in conformance with an active <b>certification</b> listing <b>or</b> <b>approval</b> that has been issued by an organization that is accredited both for testing and product certification, such as those issued by Underwriters Laboratories, NTA Inc, FM Global, American Nuclear Insurers, or the Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik (DIBt). In concept, if a product, such as a fire door or a fire extinguisher, or a toaster {{is used in the}} intended manner the use of the component or system will perform as described in the listing and/or <b>approval.</b> The listing <b>or</b> test is often cited by a regulation, such as a building code or a fire code, and becomes enforcable through adopted codes or regulations. This concept is known as bounding in the nuclear industry. Products whose use is not mandated by any building codes or fire codes often lack a consensus test method. Unless there is a test standard in existence to prove the functionality and reliability of such a product, there can be no certification listing. Many authorities are charged to review and approve results from qualified testing agencies, when for the purpose intended, the evidence shows compliance for a material, product or construction method that provides equivalent strength, quality, fire resistance, durability and safety when evaluated through general engineering practices.|$|R
