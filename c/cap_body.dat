40|$|The {{radiative}} heating to the probe's {{surface and}} the effects of the recession of the heat shield caused by this heating are analyzed for five initial probe configurations for a Jovian entry. The initial configurations are spherically <b>capped,</b> conical <b>bodies</b> and hyperboloids. The results show that severe blunting of the nose region occurs for all configurations due to ablation of the heat shield caused by the large radiative heating rates. Recession at the nose region can possibly cause a concavity at the stagnation point. Furthermore, the recession of the heat shield, especially for the spherically <b>capped,</b> conical <b>bodies,</b> will be underpredicted if the change in the probe's shape during the entry is neglected in an analysis...|$|R

40|$|This {{study reveals}} that high-copy {{satellite}} II (HSATII) sequences {{in the human}} genome can bind and impact distribution of chromatin regulatory proteins and that this goes awry in cancer. In many cancers, master regulatory proteins form two types of cancer-specific nuclear bodies, caused by locus-specific deregulation of HSATII. DNA demethylation at the 1 q 12 mega-satellite, common in cancer, causes PRC 1 aggregation into prominent Cancer-Associated Polycomb (<b>CAP)</b> <b>bodies.</b> These loci remain silent, whereas HSATII loci with reduced PRC 1 become derepressed, reflecting imbalanced distribution of UbH 2 A on these and other PcG-regulated loci. Large nuclear foci of HSATII RNA form and sequester copious MeCP 2 into Cancer-Associated Satellite Transcript (CAST) bodies. Hence, HSATII DNA and RNA have an exceptional capacity to act as molecular sponges and sequester chromatin regulatory proteins into abnormal nuclear bodies in cancer. The compartmentalization of regulatory proteins within nuclear structure, triggered by demethylation of “junk” repeats, {{raises the possibility that}} this contributes to further compromise of the epigenome and neoplastic progression...|$|R

Firstly the four wooden nave forms were sustituted by overdimensioned iron lattice girders that entered the aisles and ended in a capping hoop thus allowing the absorption of the pushes from the vaults that were ruining the church fabric. Besides a careful impermeabilization of both nave and aisles roof was undertaken. &# 13; The second phase included the restoration of pases and sacristies roofs to their original configurations, both with a re-pointing of the tower's ashlers and a reopening of blinded windows in his intermediate volume. The ruined <b>capping</b> <b>body</b> made of bricks was substituted by another made of ashlers. New windows were designed according to the existent buttress and following the double arch configuration of the reopened ones.
