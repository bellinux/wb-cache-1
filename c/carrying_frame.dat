25|$|In operation, a boat is navigated {{into the}} <b>carrying</b> <b>frame,</b> {{which has been}} lowered into the water. The boat is secured to the cradle, {{possibly}} by raising slings under the hull using hydraulics, and the cradle is hauled {{out of the water}} and up the hill with a cable. At the top of the slope, the cradle is lowered into the upper waterway, and the boat released. As the boat is not floating, Archimedes' principle does not apply, so the weight lifted or lowered by the device varies – making counterbalancing (by dead weights or a second boat carriage) more difficult.|$|E
25|$|Backpacks are a {{standard}} {{part of the}} load-bearing equipment of soldiers, especially infantry, in most countries, and military-style packs are regularly available to civilians in military surplus stores. Well-known examples include the United States ALICE field pack and the British Army PLCE rucksack attachment, {{both of which are}} widely available to civilian markets both as actual military surplus (new or used) and as replicas. Such packs are often, though not always (e.g. the USMC's ILBE pack), external-frame packs, with the pack itself lashed or pinned to a metal or plastic <b>carrying</b> <b>frame.</b> For units that are entering combat situations, packs may be loaded heavily and can weigh in excess of 100lbs. Each soldier may carry extra weapons, ammunition, rations, medical supplies, tents or other shelter material, and extra clothing.|$|E

2500|$|The {{designers}} {{of the new}} Parliament House were mindful {{of the need to}} provide an appropriate space to display The Big Picture in the new building. The Joint Standing Committee responsible for the new building made the decision to place the painting in the Main Committee Room Foyer. [...] The architects worked to ensure that major design elements in the room such as the skylight and balustrade around the work allowed for the integration of the painting with the available space. Because the fragile state of the picture prevented it from being rolled, moving the painting from the High Court to Parliament House was a major logistical exercise. The move required removal of some windows at the High Court, the construction of a special <b>carrying</b> <b>frame</b> and scaffolding and a system of winches to support the picture in place. The painting remains in this specially designed location to this day.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), they scouted {{the land as}} far as Hebron.

At the end of 40 days, they returned and reported to Moses, Aaron, and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh, saying that the land did indeed flow with milk and honey (date honey) but that the people who inhabited it were powerful, the cities were fortified and very large, and that they saw the Anakites there. Caleb hushed the people and urged them to go up and take the land. But the other scouts spread calumnies about the land, calling it [...] "one that devours its settlers." [...] They reported that the land's people were giants and stronger than the Israelites. The whole community broke into crying, railed against Moses and Aaron, and shouted: [...] "If only we might die in this wilderness!" [...] Moses and Aaron fell on their faces, and Joshua and Caleb rent their clothes.|$|E

5000|$|In addition, some {{carriers}} of the LWS allele {{appear to be}} solid.

5000|$|Terminology {{as well as}} {{identification}} can be {{a challenge}} even for knowledgeable breeders.

The skin is chased with silver and partially gilt; hair and beard are gilt. Damascened silver Reichsadler, the heraldic charge of the Holy Roman Empire signifying Charlemagne's imperial dignity, decorate the tunic. The eagles are surrounded by a border of filigree and precious stones, some of which are ancient intaglios.

50|$|Wartime sets {{generally}} {{required a}} 6 V or 12 V supply, and batteries were charged {{by a small}} petrol-engined charging set (generator) of 300 W, often the 'Chorehorse' type. When in use, this generator was carried {{out of the vehicle}} on a <b>carrying</b> <b>frame</b> and placed on the ground outside. The vehicle's own engine and lighting batteries were separate. Some vehicles were fitted with additional radio charging dynamos driven from a gearbox PTO. Later in the war, 24 V vehicles began to appear, firstly US-supplied armoured vehicles, further complicating the wireless supply considerations. In the case of the 19 set, a composite power supply that allowed 12 V, two-wire 24 V and 3-wire (i.e. 0 - 12 - 24 V) systems was introduced. This power supply also contained a vibrator type HT section so that the receiver section of the set could be run more economically.|$|E
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of this scientific work, the 1922 expedition planned to use bottled oxygen. One bottle contained ca. 240 litres of oxygen. Four bottles were fixed on a <b>carrying</b> <b>frame</b> {{which had to be}} carried by the mountaineer. With the additional elements there was a weight of ca. 14.5 kg., so every mountaineer {{at the beginning of a}} climbing day had to bear a very heavy additional load. Ten of these systems were part of the expedition equipment. As well as a mask over mouth and nose, a tube was held in the mouth. Dreyer also had proposed the flow of oxygen: at 7000 m a flow rate of 2 litres of oxygen per minute, on the summit climb they should use 2.4 litres per minute. The result was a usable time of two hours per bottle. So all the oxygen would be used up after a maximum of 8 hours of climbing. Nowadays, 3 or 4 litre bottles are filled with oxygen of 250 bar pressure. At a flow of 2 litres per minute a modern bottle can be used for about 6 hours.|$|E
