40|$|A {{genotype}} {{by environmental}} interaction {{study was conducted}} using the live weight data collected from three discrete spawning seasons of Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia selective breeding program in Malaysia. Two production environments were used to grow-out the progeny, namely, <b>cages</b> <b>and</b> ponds. The analysis was carried by using animal mixed model and treating live weight in <b>cages</b> <b>and</b> in ponds as two different traits to determine the genetic correlation, which was used to quantify the genotype by environmental interaction for these two environments. The heritabilities estimated from the animal variance component were 0. 34 ± 0. 061 and 0. 40 ± 0. 067, for <b>cages</b> <b>and</b> ponds, respectively. The genetic correlation between live weight in <b>cages</b> <b>and</b> ponds was 0. 75 ± 0. 091. Responses to selection were separately estimated for live weight in these two environments, and were 18. 6 % in <b>cages</b> <b>and</b> 15. 3 % in ponds after two generations of selection. Based on these results, we conclude that selection response was being achieved in both environments and that, {{despite the presence of}} a non-unity genetic correlation between live weight in <b>cages</b> <b>and</b> ponds, there was no significant evidence for genotype by environmental interaction for these two main aquaculture systems in Malaysia...|$|R

Cage was slammed through a glass table by Brother Ray. Rhino {{returned}} from injury on the July3 episode of Impact!, challenging Team 3D and Angle to a Six Man Tag Team match at Victory Road, while teasing at adding Full Metal Mayhem rules to the bout. An online poll was held to determine the stipulation for the match, resulting in Full Metal Mayhem being chosen. The team of Angle and Team 3D were the victors at the event.|$|E
5|$|As Owen Hart {{entered the}} steel cage for his {{championship}} match {{with his brother}} Bret, he immediately attacked Bret. Bret gained the advantage by performing a DDT. Owen kicked Bret {{in the head and}} tried to escape from the cage. The brothers both tried to climb over the cage several times, but neither would let the other escape. The match consisted mainly of brawling, including a couple of occasions when the two exchanged punches while standing on the top rope. Owen climbed over the cage, but Bret dragged him back in by pulling Owen's hair. Owen performed a piledriver on Bret, but Bret came back by throwing Owen into the bars of the cage. As Owen tried to escape, Bret suplexed him back into the ring {{from the top of the}} cage. Owen recovered and performed the Sharpshooter on Bret, but Bret escaped and used the same move on Owen. The match ended after Bret threw Owen's head into the steel <b>cage</b> <b>and</b> Owen's leg became trapped between the cage's bars. Bret climbed over the top of the <b>cage</b> <b>and</b> dropped to the floor to win the match and retain the title. After the match, Jim Neidhart attacked Davey Boy Smith, another brother-in-law of the Hart brothers. Neidhart padlocked the <b>cage,</b> <b>and</b> he and Owen attacked Bret until the other Harts could intervene.|$|E

40|$|Animal {{facilities}} {{generate a}} large amount of used bedding containing excrement as medical waste. We developed a recycling system for used bedding that involves soft hydrothermal processing. In this study, we examined the effects of bedding type on growth, hematologic and serum biochemical values, and organ weights of female and male mice reared on either recycled or fresh bedding from 3 to 33 wk of age. Neither growth nor physiology differed between mice housed on recycled bedding compared with fresh bedding. When 14 -wk-old mice were bred, litter size and total number of weaned pups showed no significant differences between animals raised on recycled or fresh bedding. Because bedding type influences the environment within <b>cages</b> <b>and</b> animal rooms, we evaluated particulate and ammonia data from <b>cages</b> <b>and</b> animal rooms. Values were significantly lower from <b>cages</b> <b>and</b> rooms that used recycled bedding than from those using fresh bedding, thus indicating that recycled bedding has the potential to improve the environment within both <b>cages</b> <b>and</b> animal rooms. Overall, this study revealed that recycled bedding is an excellent material for use in housing laboratory rodents. Specifically, recycled bedding may reduce medical waste and maintain healthy environments within <b>cages</b> <b>and</b> animal rooms...|$|R
