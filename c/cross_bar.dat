5|$|Horse collar: A {{significant}} {{improvement of the}} ancient breast harness was the horse collar. The horse collar was depicted in a Northern Wei (386–534) mural at Dunhuang, China, dated 477–499; the latter artwork does not feature the essential collar cushion behind the <b>cross</b> <b>bar,</b> though, while a later Tang Dynasty (618–907) mural of about 851 accurately displays the cushioned collar behind the <b>cross</b> <b>bar.</b> An earlier painting of the Sui Dynasty (581–618) accurately depicted the horse collar as it is seen today, yet the illustration shows its use on a camel instead of a horse.|$|E
5|$|Forty {{years earlier}} than de Tournefort, de Thévenot {{described}} {{much the same}} process, adding that it was seldom used because it was regarded as too cruel. Some 80 years prior to de Thevenot, in 1579, Hans Jacob Breuning von Buchenbach witnessed {{a variant of the}} gaunching ritual. A large iron hook was fixed on the horizontal cross-bar of the gallows and the individual was forced upon this hook, piercing him from the abdomen through his back, so that he hung from it, hands, feet and head downward. On top of the <b>cross</b> <b>bar,</b> the executioner situated himself and performed various torture on the impaled man below him.|$|E

But {{even when}} so placed, they cannot {{be trusted to}} support {{themselves}} beyond a certain height, but will need <b>cross</b> <b>bars</b> to steady them. <b>Cross</b> <b>bars</b> of stone are, therefore, to be introduced at necessary intervals, not to divide the glass, but to support the upright stone bars. The glass is always to be divided longitudinally as far as possible, and the upright bars which divide it supported at proper intervals. However high the window, {{it is almost impossible}} that it should require more than two <b>cross</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
50|$|Anti-slip steel grating {{is a type}} of bar grating. Steel bar grating is {{manufactured}} in a variety of methods. Welded bar grating consists of load bars electrically fuse welded to <b>cross</b> <b>bars.</b> Pressure-locked bar grating, or swaged grating, is where steel rods are forced through and locked in load bars. Riveted bar grating is where the load bars are riveted to the <b>cross</b> <b>bars.</b> There are wide varieties of trade names for each type manufactured.|$|R

25|$|Straight {{movements}} are {{in one of}} eight directions for either plane, as in the eight principal directions of a compass. A long straight arrow indicates movement from the elbow, a short arrow with a <b>cross</b> <b>bar</b> behind it indicates motion from the wrist, and a simple short arrow indicates a small movement. (Doubled, in opposite directions, these can show nodding from the wrist.) A secondary curved arrow crossing the main arrow shows that the arm twists while it moves. (Doubled, in opposite directions, these can show shaking of the hand.) Arrows can turn, curve, zigzag, and loop-the-loop.|$|E
25|$|Two {{weeks later}} Johnson captained Leicester as they {{traveled}} to Nottingham's City Ground for the Heineken Cup semi final against Llanelli. Tigers won {{thanks to a}} Tim Stimpson penalty which hit both the post and the <b>cross</b> <b>bar</b> before going through the posts. Tigers were again victorious in the final winning 15-9 against Munster; the match is best remembered for Austin Healey's try and Neil Back's handling in a last-minute scrum on the Tigers' line. Though Tigers did have two further tries ruled out in dubious circumstances. Johnson had a try ruled out after 10 minute after also having a first minute score from Freddie Tuilagi ruled out.|$|E
25|$|Field goal : Scored by a {{drop kick}} or place kick (except on a kickoff) when the ball, after being kicked and without again {{touching}} the ground, {{goes over the}} <b>cross</b> <b>bar</b> and between the goal posts (or between lines extended {{from the top of}} the goal posts) of the opponent's goal, worth three points. If the ball hits the upright above the cross-bar before going through, it is not considered a dead ball, and the points are scored. (Rule 5, Sect 4, Art 4(d)) If the field goal is missed, but the ball is not returnable after crossing the dead-ball-line, then it constitutes a rouge (see below).|$|E

50|$|On March 24 2012, female escape artist Dayle Krall of Sherry and Krall Magic {{became the}} only person in history since Houdini`s death to perform this escape in an exact working replica of his infamous Chinese Water Torture Cell. Harry Houdini had {{different}} versions of his Water Torture Cell. His original included an inner cage and two outer <b>cross</b> <b>bars</b> which were later removed from the performance. This original version with the inner cage and <b>cross</b> <b>bars</b> has not been seen since Houdini and was performed by Dayle Krall on September 21, 2012 to celebrate the exact 100th Anniversary.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to his large cattle herds, Colter also had extensive sheep flocks as well. By 1916, he held a large flock which grazed in Apache County during the summer months, and moved into Maricopa County, underneath the Roosevelt Dam during the winter months, where Colter had purchased extensive acreage to pasture his animals. The commissary he {{set up on the}} Colter Ranch was not only to serve the numerous ranch hands which worked his herds and flocks, but also served the surrounding ranches as well, becoming quite successful. By the end of 1917 the Colter Ranch, also known as the <b>Cross</b> <b>Bar</b> Ranch, after his brand, had grown into {{one of the largest in}} the state of Arizona.|$|E
25|$|As with orientation, {{movement}} arrows distinguish two planes: Movement in {{the vertical}} plane (up & down) {{is represented by}} arrows with double stems, as {{at the bottom of}} the diagram at left, while single-stemmed arrows represent movement parallel to the floor (to & fro). In addition, movement in a diagonal plane uses modified double-stemmed arrows: A <b>cross</b> <b>bar</b> on the stem indicates that the motion is away as well up or down, and a solid dot indicates approaching motion. To & fro movement that also goes over or under something uses modified single-stemmed arrows, with the part of the arrow representing near motion thicker than the rest. These are iconic, but conventionalized, and so need to be learned individually.|$|E
25|$|Later in the quarter, Cory Ross' 18-yard {{punt return}} gave the Ravens {{a first down}} on the Colts' 42-yard line. Six plays later, Matt Stover kicked a 40-yard field goal on the first play of the second quarter to cut their deficit to 6–3. Two plays after the ensuing kickoff, Baltimore safety Ed Reed intercepted a pass from Peyton Manning at the Ravens' 45-yard line. Baltimore {{subsequently}} moved to {{the ball to the}} Colts' 4-yard line, but then gave it back when Steve McNair's third-down pass was intercepted by Antoine Bethea. Following the turnover, the Colts marched 63 yards in 13 plays and scored with Vinatieri's third field goal, which hit the <b>cross</b> <b>bar</b> and bounced through the uprights, to give them a 9–3 halftime lead.|$|E
50|$|The {{front and}} rear legs are {{strengthened}} by bars under the seat. These bars are whole and were originally silver-plated too. The ends of these <b>cross</b> <b>bars</b> are gilt and shaped like stylised papyrus.|$|R

25|$|Herb Steger {{replaced}} Roby {{to start}} the fourth. Steger fumbled, making the Wolverines punt from their own 25-yard line. Reese again showed skill in his sidestepping, but was injured. Red Rountree replaced him. Goebel eventually came back in and hurled a pass, which if complete may have got 25 yards, but Rountree broke up the pass, forcing a punt. In desperation, Goebel was now often passing; and the Commodores were often deflecting the passes. A 15-yard penalty made it 3rd down and 33 for the Wolverines. On fourth down, Goebel attempted a 45-yard place kick which fell short of the <b>cross</b> <b>bar.</b> The last try for Michigan involved two incomplete passes, an attempted end run by Steger, and an interception by Commodore guard Fatty Lawrence. Vanderbilt had the ball at Michigan's 48-yard line as the game ended. It is said the tie was preserved when Neely recovered a fumble near the Commodore goal.|$|E
500|$|The game {{featured}} few penalties, no injuries, and few substitutions. [...] Michigan {{made only}} three substitutions, and Vanderbilt none. Michigan completed {{five out of}} 16 passes for 90 yards. Vanderbilt completed just one of five for a nine-yard gain. [...] Two field goal attempts by Kipke failed. One was blocked and another rolled under the <b>cross</b> <b>bar.</b> The one other long gain {{of the day was}} a 20-yard run late in the third quarter from Herb Steger. The run came just after Vanderbilt had advanced its furthest into Michigan territory and had its drive ended by a Steger interception. [...] Vanderbilt never advanced far enough to attempt a field goal.|$|E
500|$|The FA had {{remained}} largely dormant after {{the creation of}} its rules but in 1866 Sheffield F.C. suggested a match between it and a FA club. This was misunderstood and they ended up playing a combined FA team on 31 March 1866 under FA rules. The game was the first ever to limit the match to 90minutes and Sheffield F.C. adopted it as its preferred length of match. The rule would {{make it to the}} FA rule book in 1877. A second match was suggested by the London FA in a letter sent in November or the same year but never took place, the reason being disputes of which rules should be used. The FA introduced an [...] <b>cross</b> <b>bar</b> used by Sheffield in the same year only for Sheffield to then decide to raise it to [...] The fair catch was also dropped by Sheffield. This completed the transition to a purely kicking game.|$|E
40|$|Human {{subjects}} perceive two <b>crossing</b> <b>bars,</b> one {{in front}} of the other, when shown a cross with disparity added to its horizontal limbs, and they also perceive neon-color spreading when shown a stereoscopic Redies–Spillmann figure. It has thus been hypothesized that the human visual system follows the principle of generic image sampling in reconstructing 3 -dimensional (3 -D) surface structures. Here we examine whether monkeys also perceive these surface structures. The results indicate that monkeys, like humans, perceive two <b>crossing</b> <b>bars</b> and neon-color spreading and suggest that the principle of generic image sampling may also be applied to visual perception in monkeys. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

50|$|The Legbar was {{the second}} autosexing chicken breed created by Prof. Punnett and M. Pease at the Genetical Institute in Cambridge, after the Cambar, which was created in 1929 by <b>crossing</b> <b>Barred</b> Plymouth Rock with Gold Campine.|$|R
50|$|Bishamon yari possessed some of {{the most}} ornate designs for any spear. Running {{parallel}} to the long central blade were two 'crescent moon' shaped blades facing outwards. They were attached in two locations by short <b>cross</b> <b>bars,</b> making the head look somewhat like a fleur-de-lis.|$|R
2500|$|During [...] "The Victors", {{the drum}} major marches {{down to the}} north end zone goal post and tosses his/her mace over the <b>cross</b> <b>bar.</b> Superstition says that if the drum major catches the mace without {{dropping}} it, the football team will win the game.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, no {{points at}} all were awarded for a try, the reward being to [...] "try" [...] {{to score a}} goal (to kick the ball over the <b>cross</b> <b>bar</b> and between the posts).

2500|$|Scrappy Moore {{made the}} 32-yard drop-kick {{to seal the}} game for the Bulldogs in the fourth quarter. The ball just passed over the <b>cross</b> <b>bar.</b> Georgia's passing game got them again to Vanderbilt's 10-yard line when the game ended. Vanderbilt made just one first down in the second half. [...] Of its 30-second half yards, 23 came on a desperate pass near the end. Guard Zach Coles was {{discovered}} on this day, coming in for McKibbon he single-handedly stopped one of Georgia's goal line threats.|$|E

30|$|Target-present {{displays}} contained one T-shaped {{target and}} 99  L-shaped distractors and target-absent displays contained 100  L-shaped distractors. Each item (target T or distractor L) could be rotated 0, 90 °, 180 °, or 270 ° along the y-axis (see Fig.  1) and was 15 [*]×[*] 7 [*]×[*] 17 voxels (0.89 ° ×[*] 0.64 ° ×[*] 1.3 °) for the X, Y, and Z coordinates, respectively. The T-shaped targets were constructed with two perfectly aligned perpendicular <b>cross</b> <b>bars</b> {{and the two}} <b>cross</b> <b>bars</b> were offset by 3 voxels (0.27 °) to form non-perfect, L-shaped distractors. Both the targets and distractors had a 3 -voxel gap between the <b>cross</b> <b>bars.</b> Colors of the search items were randomly selected within a gray-scale range of 47 – 63 % white. The search items were randomly placed within a 15 [*]×[*] 15 [*]×[*] 15 location matrix for the 3 D displays. The matrix was transcribed into the sphere and any cells that overlapped {{the perimeter of the}} sphere were removed, so no target or distractor could appear outside the display area. The search items were then jittered by 0 – 16 pixels along the x- and y-axes and by 0 – 32 pixels in the z-axis for the 3 D displays.|$|R
2500|$|The lone {{score of}} the game came on a 15-yard field goal by {{consensus}} first-team All-American Jack Blott in the second quarter. Play was in Vanderbilt territory {{for all of the}} first half. After Michigan had reached the Vanderbilt 7-yard line, two drives at the line failed, resulting in lost yardage. On third down, Jack Blott was called into the backfield from his normal position at center and kicked a field goal. Two field goal attempts by Kipke failed. One was blocked and another rolled under the <b>cross</b> <b>bar.</b> The one other long gain of the day was a 20-yard run late in the third quarter from Herb Steger. The run came just after Vanderbilt had advanced its furthest into Michigan territory and had its drive ended by a Steger interception.

2500|$|The Royal Navy {{contingent}} in {{the second}} punitive expedition consisted of Leda, , Malacca, , , and Procris, with Captain Sayer of Leda as the senior naval officer. The HEIC contributed the cruisers Malabar, Teignmouth, and Aurora, seven gunboats, the transport Troubridge, and the East Indiaman [...] The army contingent consisted of the 14th Regiment of Foot, a company each from the Bengal artillery and the HEIC's European Regiment, and the 3rd Bengal Volunteer Battalion. Eventually the British vessels, except the frigates, were able to <b>cross</b> <b>bar</b> {{in front of the}} river and move towards the town of Sambas. Capturing two forts yielded over 70 brass and iron guns of mixed calibers, but the town of itself yielded little booty. The expedition was able to recapture the Portuguese brig Coromandel, which the pirates had captured the year before. British casualties from combat were relatively low, but casualties from fever and disease were high.|$|E
2500|$|After the breastcollar harness, {{the next}} and final {{evolutionary}} stage was the collar harness. The collar allows a horse to use its full strength when pulling, essentially allowing the horse to push forward with its hindquarters into the collar. [...] The fully developed collar harness was developed in Southern and Northern Dynasties China during the 5th century AD. The first questionable depiction of it in art appears on painted moulded-bricks in the Three Kingdoms (220–265 AD) era tomb of Bao Sanniang at Zhaohua, Sichuan province, China. These paintings display an amply padded horse collar {{with no sign of}} a yoke. However, the earliest legitimate depiction of it in art is on a Dunhuang cave mural (cave 257) from the Chinese Northern Wei Dynasty, the painting dated to 477–499 AD. In this painting the arching <b>cross</b> <b>bar</b> is clear, but the artist failed to clearly show the cushioned collar behind it, without which the [...] whole design would have been rendered useless.|$|E
