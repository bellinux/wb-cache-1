25|$|Professional diver {{training}} is generally provided by schools affiliated to or approved {{by one or}} more of the commercial, scientific or other professional diver certification or registration organizations. Professional diver training standards may require a significantly higher level of over-training than most recreational certification agencies, as the professional diver is expected to manage most contingencies and still perform the planned work under difficult conditions. Professional divers may also be provided with what is variously known as confidence training or stress training, where simulated emergencies are enacted, or unlikely contingencies are simulated, with the intended result of developing the diver's <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to manage contingencies while in a controlled environment. The amount of time spent on skill and confidence development is generally proportional to the length of the training programme, as the basic skills are usually learned fairly quickly.|$|E

Sportswriter John B. Sheridan was among the critics of the system, saying, [...] "The specialist in baseball is no good and won't go very far... The whole effect of the system will be to make the players affected half men... It is farewell, a long farewell to all that player's chance of greatness...

500|$|The Holy Jesus Hospital {{has been}} {{the centre of the}} National Trust’s Inner City Project. By August 2004, £800,000 had been spent on renovating the building. [...] Funds for the {{restoration}} of the site came from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Tyne and Wear Partnership. The project had been running since 1987 in the east end of Newcastle working with young people from 12-25 and with the over 50s, taking them out to the countryside. [...] The National Trust needed a central office to expand their work into other inner city areas, so a 25-year lease was negotiated with the council. The Exhibition Room on the site features touch screens and 3D models to help teach people about the site's history of helping the townspeople. In the book The Remains of Distant Times: Archaeology and the National Trust, Priscilla Boniface criticizes what she believes to be the National Trust's lack of interest in operating in urban environments but praises the Inner City Project as a step towards rectifying this. She wrote [...] "Its occasional ventures - such as the Newcastle Inner City Project...by their frequent mention in National Trust communications, merely serve to underline how few of their type the Trust has to call on for report." [...] She argues that although the aim of introducing town dwellers to the countryside is [...] "laudable", the [...] "respectful and serious suggestion might be made, though, that a person or person's might be usefully employed also with the objective of raising National Trust people's understanding of and <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to visit and enjoy, or at least encounter, the city."

[...] Individuals with low core self-evaluations will consistently {{feel that they are}} unable to handle work tasks because they lack the ability or control. [...] For this reason, those with low core self-evaluations will be more susceptible to job burnout than those with high core self-evaluations, who appraise themselves positively and have <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to manage the situation.

2500|$|More recently, {{scholars}} {{focused on}} self-identification {{as a good}} measure of a person's political independence. The value of self-identification {{as a measure of}} a person's political independence or partisanship is that it is seen as a proxy for the behavior which should be exhibited by the independent voter. Additionally, self-identification could be easily captured either with a nominal question ("Do you self-identify with an existing political party?", a question which is answered with a [...] "yes" [...] or a [...] "no"), or by a structured ordinal question ("Generally speaking, do you consider yourself a Democrat, a Republican, an independent, or what?"). The first analyses of this measure of political independence found that there were significant differences between those individuals who self-identified as [...] "independent" [...] and those who listed [...] "no preference" [...] as to party identification. Individuals who expressed [...] "no preference" [...] usually exhibited low levels of interest in politics, low levels of knowledge about the candidates and issues, low frequency of voting, and less <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to influence politics.|$|E
