5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, duties arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them would either {{result in a}} <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> conception or in a <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> the will. The former are classified as perfect duties, the latter as imperfect. A perfect duty always holds true—there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, so we must never lie. An imperfect duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect duty {{because we are not}} obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that perfect duties are more important than imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect duty must be followed.|$|E
5|$|During trials, {{the player}} cross-examines witnesses. They can move {{backwards}} and forwards through {{statements in the}} testimony, and can choose to press the witness {{for more information on}} a particular statement; sometimes, the witness will revise their testimony based on this. If the player spots a lie or a <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> the testimony, they can present evidence to demonstrate the contradiction. If the player presents incorrect evidence, the judge's confidence in the player will be lowered; if the judge's confidence in the player is depleted, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenario}} {{was based}} around {{the concept of}} five different races, and the interaction with a human character. The story premise of a human character becoming {{a member of one}} of the five playable races was born out of a compromise about who and what the player character should be. The concept of a non-human character was introduced by Horii as he saw an inherent <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> the idea of a human saving the other tribes. This raised some contention among the staff including Fujisawa due to the Dragon Quest series' established convention of a human as the main protagonist, but Fujisawa and Horii decided to have the player character be a human first and later become one of the five tribes. Part of the story's initial drama came from the player character growing accustomed to their new form. Once the basic scenario concept had been finalized, the team commissioned the various character designs from Toriyama. In contrast to the greater majority of MMORPGs, which did not seem to have a solid ending, the team wanted to create a definitive ending with a final boss as featured in normal RPGs.|$|E
30|$|The <b>contradictions</b> <b>in</b> {{these studies}} are in the levels of strategy, management, or culture. But, {{there is almost no}} study about the {{relationship}} between the contradiction solving of TRIZ and the <b>contradictions</b> <b>in</b> the strategy level in both management and engineering literatures. We find the fact that the solutions of the operating <b>contradictions</b> <b>in</b> the ten engineers’ projects of Table  1 are patents or new technologies, which do assist the implement of the innovative strategies of the related companies. The relationships between the <b>contradictions</b> <b>in</b> strategy level and the operating <b>contradiction</b> level <b>in</b> a company do exist, at least in some situations.|$|R

5|$|Virgil C Aldrich {{reviewed}} the book alongside Religion and the Modern Mind and The Gate of Silence, also by Stace {{and published in}} 1952. He points out that all three books mark a new direction for Stace who was previously best known as an empiricist and naturalist. For Aldrich this new intellectual interest results in a sharp dualism in both Stace’s personality and his thought. However, he writes that fortunately Stace’s philosophical background prevents him from supposing that scientific empiricism can confirm religious experience, indeed his religious philosophy is the sort “that a Hume or a Kant can consort with.” Aldrich argues that Stace’s intellectual sophistication is most evident in his ideas about the negative divine, but his thought is liable to all the standard objections where he proposes notions of the positive divine and religious intuition. Specifically, the notion that religious language is evocative of the mystical experience is problematic, because {{it is difficult to}} determine what language is adequate without resorting to literal or abstract ideas. Rudolf Otto’s notion of analogy, rejected by Stace, is more robust. Aldrich points out a <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> Stace’s reliance on hierarchies of being and values to more adequately refer to God, as this implies continuity between the world and eternity, which Stace denies.|$|E

25|$|Simply put, {{the test}} is that one must universalize the maxim (imagine that all people acted in this way) and then see if {{it would still be}} {{possible}} to perform the maxim in the world without <b>contradiction.</b> <b>In</b> Groundwork, Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a universal action, no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a <b>contradiction</b> <b>in</b> conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty).|$|E
