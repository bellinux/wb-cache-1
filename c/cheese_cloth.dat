50|$|Growing tobacco {{continued}} to be profitable {{until the beginning of}} the Civil War in 1861, even when the European markets were no longer available. Of course, during the war and the Reconstruction Era, very little tobacco was grown except for personal use. Those days were tremendously difficult, and recovery was a slow process. The post-war search for a money crop led to the resurgence of the tobacco culture. Through these experiments it was discovered that tobacco which was light in color and silky in texture demanded the highest prices. So, with more experimentation, shading the plants began. At first, wood slats were used, but these proved too heavy. Then they tried slats draped with <b>cheese</b> <b>cloth</b> to keep the plants from the light. Next came ribbed <b>cheese</b> <b>cloth.</b> Ultimately in 1950, the white <b>cheese</b> <b>cloth</b> was replaced with a treated, longer lasting, yellow cloth that provided perfect shade.|$|E

40|$|This modest book {{examines}} {{the world of}} petty entrepreneurs in a late medieval Italian town. It {{is based on a}} rare collection of 46 account books from small tradesmen in the archives of Prato, a town better known for the extraordinarily rich archive of business and personal records left by the wealthy merchant Francesco Datini. The author was guided in his study by Richard Goldthwaite, a leading expert on late medieval account books. The ledgers provide a look at a little-studied social and economic group. They are especially revealing because they were used not only for business entries but also to record family events, including births, deaths, and marriages. As Marco Spallanzani points out in a preface to the book, most scholarship on medieval tradesmen centers on guilds and guild members. The people represented in these ledgers operated outside of economic corporations. They were not a homogeneous group but included a thirteenth-century moneylender, fourteenth-century druggists, <b>cheese</b> sellers, <b>cloth</b> sellers, a tailor, a doublet maker, a grain seller, a secondhand dealer, a broker, a cloth shearer, butchers, wallers, paper makers, and a family of innkeepers who were responsible for seventeen account books. As Marshall notes, the business atmosphere was casual, and this list is a bit deceptive because people s stated occupations were not always how they made their money. One man named as a second-hand dealer in fact used a broker to trade commodities, including 318 pounds of Sardinian cheese, bought one day and sold at a profit the next. ...|$|R

At first the Livingstons {{imported}} small numbers of slaves from Antigua and Jamaica. One {{of the most notorious}} open-air markets was along the East River at the end of Wall Street. In August 1733, Philip's sloop Katherine returned with fifty blacks from Jamaica. In 1738, Philip bought a one-third share in a voyage to Guinea, where two hundred slaves were purchased and consigned to his son Peter Van Brugh and his partner in Jamaica. The ships also handled gold and ivory. The ship Oswego out of Jamaica, arrived in New York in August 1741, carrying a consignment of twelve African slaves. Slave ships continued to arrive in port despite the panic caused that summer by a so-called slave insurrection in the city. In 1749, the sloop Rhode Island, owned by the company Philip Livingston & Sons, traded rum, tobacco and <b>cheese</b> for guns, <b>cloth</b> and ivory, which it then traded on the African coast for 124 slaves. In 1750 Livingston & Sons had three vessels working the African coast. They also owned shares in the Stork and the Sarah and Elizabeth.

60|$|XIX. Hence then {{a general}} law, of {{singular}} {{importance in the}} present day, a law of simple common sense,--not to decorate things belonging to purposes of active and occupied life. Wherever you can rest, there decorate; where rest is forbidden, so is beauty. You must not mix ornament with business, {{any more than you}} may mix play. Work first, and then rest. Work first and then gaze, but do not use golden ploughshares, nor bind ledgers in enamel. Do not thrash with sculptured flails: nor put bas-reliefs on millstones. What! it will be asked, are we in the habit of doing so? Even so; always and everywhere. The most familiar position of Greek mouldings is in these days on shop fronts. There is not a tradesman's sign nor shelf nor counter in all the streets of all our cities, which has not upon it ornaments which were invented to adorn temples and beautify kings' palaces. There is not the smallest advantage in them where they are. Absolutely valueless--utterly without the power of giving pleasure, they only satiate the eye, and vulgarise their own forms. Many of these are in themselves thoroughly good copies of fine things, which things themselves we shall never, in consequence, enjoy any more. Many a pretty beading and graceful bracket there is in wood or stucco above our grocers' and cheese-mongers' and hosiers' shops: how it is that the tradesmen cannot understand that custom is to be had only by selling good tea and <b>cheese</b> and <b>cloth,</b> and that people come to them for their honesty, and their readiness, and their right wares, and not because they have Greek cornices over their windows, or their names in large gilt letters on their house fronts? how pleasurable it would be to have the power of going through the streets of London, pulling down those brackets and friezes and large names, restoring to the tradesmen the capital they had spent in architecture, and putting them on honest and equal terms, each with his name in black letters over his door, not shouted {{down the street from the}} upper stories, and each with a plain wooden shop casement, with small panes in it that people would not think of breaking in order to be sent to prison! How much better for them would it be--how much happier, how much wiser, to put their trust upon their own truth and industry, and not on the idiocy of their customers. It is curious, and it says little for our national probity on the one hand, or prudence on the other, to see the whole system of our street decoration based on the idea that people must be baited to a shop as moths are to a candle.|$|R

For standard firm Asian tofu, the soy curd is cut and strained of excess liquid using <b>cheese</b> <b>cloth</b> or muslin and then lightly pressed to produce a soft cake. Firmer tofus, such as Asian dry tofu (...) or Western types of tofu, are further pressed to remove even more liquid. In Vietnam, the curd is strained and molded in a square mold, and the end product is called đậu khuôn (molded bean) or đậu phụ (one of the Vietnamese ways to pronounce the Chinese dòufu). The tofu curds are allowed to cool and become firm. The finished tofu can then be cut into pieces, flavored or further processed.|$|E

If the paskha is cooked, this mass is then heated. The pan containing the mixture is then placed in a container of cold water and progressively cooled. Afterwards it is placed in a tradional wooden mould assembly called pasochnitsa (пасочница), with a layer of <b>cheese</b> <b>cloth</b> protecting the mould. The wooden mould can be taken apart for cleaning; however, more modern materials, such as plastics, are used nowadays.

50|$|This type is {{produced}} by using a mixture of whole milk and skim milk. First the raw milk is heated at about 35 C and rennet and enzymes are added as a liquid solution to make it coagulate. The batter obtained is then kneaded and partially cooked: the curd is broken into many small parts (of {{the size of a}} grain of rice). At this stage there are two other firings: to 40 and 47 C. The paste is removed from the heat, stirred with a large whisk and then the curd is extracted and placed in molds lined with <b>cheese</b> <b>cloth</b> for forming. It is divided up and left to rest {{for a couple of hours}} on a draining table and then the cheese is turned several times. The pre-salting stage then takes place where the last whey is removed and the DOP logo is impressed onto the side. This process takes a couple of days (at least 48 hours) and during this time the wheels are turned several times. The cheese is then salted in one of two ways: by spreading salt over the surface of the cheese or by soaking it in brine. The last step is the ageing process which lasts at least 60 days and must take place within the area of origin in warehouses where the storage temperature and relative humidity are meticulously controlled (optimal values are 10 - 15 C and 80-85%).|$|E

The small intestine fluid was collected and prepared according to Liang (2013). After incubation of experimental feed into Rusitec, the undigested residue was dried at 65  °C and weighed 2.50 [*]±[*] 0.04  g DM basis into 100  mL bottles (8 replicates per treatment) for in vitro abomasum digestibility with 6  h incubation by automatic incubactor and shaker. Furthermore, after incubation at abomasum, the contents were filtered through two layers of <b>cheese</b> <b>cloth,</b> the residue was dried at 65  °C and weighted 0.60 [*]±[*] 0.05  g DM basis pour into 100  mL bottles with 10  mL of fluid from abomasum and 30  mL of artificial saliva were added with same replication for in vitro ileum digestibility. Incubation was carried out for 18  h in an automatic incubactor and shaker, contents were filtered fluid and undigested residue (abomasum and ileum) were collected for further analysis.|$|E
