40|$|Paper {{engineering}} of strength, {{structure and}} surface using interactions between cellulose and cationic polyelectrolytes are investigated {{with the aim}} of improving paper-based bio-analytical devices (PADs). Advances are described based on fundamental knowledge and engineering aspects in this field that have enable the development of lighter weight papers that have high wet strengths, controlled porosities and multi-functional properties that can be fine tuned. The influence of reactive cationic polyelectrolyte, polyamideamine-epichlorohydrin (PAE) on paper strength behaviour was studied using hardwood fibers, both with and without inorganic electrolyte. Ion type and concentration in the papermaking process water was found to influence the strength development in different ways. The relationship between repulpability of PAE- strengthened paper and wet strength is described. The effect of blending microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) with hardwood fibers is compared with the refining of hardwood fibers on paper composite properties, with and without PAE addition. Papers incorporating tethered MFC, produced by refining of hardwood fibres, are found to provide equivalent strength properties to papers incorporating untethered MFC with significant drainage benefits and formation uniformity. Air permeability of the composites decreases with untethered and tethered MFC addition. MFC achieved by ball milling and cellulose micro-particles (CMPs) developed by cryogenic milling softwood fiber are compared with commercial MFC produced by homogenization. The effect of blending two MFCs and CMPs with hardwood fibers on the paper composites properties is investigated in terms of nano/micro cellulose dimensions. CMPs act as mechanical debonding agents and decrease substrate density and strength whereas MFC have higher aspect ratios and smaller size distributions that significantly improve strength and density of composite sheets while decreasing porosities. The addition of MFC combined with PAE can increase both dry and wet strength. The different stress-strain curves under wet conditions are described and these suggest two different mechanisms of strength development: MFC-fiber entanglement and fiber-fiber <b>contact</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> The role of paper macroscale properties and structure are described in PADs used to type human red blood cells (RBCs). A series of commercial and laboratory-generated papers varying in fibre composition, basis weight, density and porosity are studied and their abilities to separate antibody agglutinated (specific) from non-agglutinated (non-specific) RBCs are reported. Image analysis is used to measure the intensities of blood spots produced by sequentially absorbing solutions of antibodies and blood samples on paper then eluting with a saline solution. The performance of these papers in blood typing is found to decrease linearly with paper density and thickness and it is inversely proportional to paper pore size. The type of fibres plays a minor role. Porous cellulose webs modified with cationic polyelectrolyte further optimize blood typing analysis. Cellulose model surfaces, in the form of quasi molecularly smooth thin cellulose films, are investigated to examine the interactions between cellulose, cationic polyelectrolytes and biomolecules. Thin smooth cellulose films are prepared by spin coating either a nanocellulose crystal suspension, or a cellulose acetate solution onto silicon surfaces with subsequent hydrolysis. Film smoothness is greatly improved by controlling the concentration of cellulose acetate and the hydrolysis time in methanolic sodium methoxide. High molecular weight polyacrylamides (CPAM) are used as model polyelectrolytes, and the nanoscale conformation of adsorbed CPAM at the cellulose/water interface is characterized in situ by specular neutron reflectometry. The effect of CPAM charge density and added NaCl (10 - 3 M) is described. At constant molecular weight, the thickness of the CPAM layer adsorbed on cellulose increases with polymer charge density. Addition of NaCl decreases the thickness of a CPAM layer already adsorbed on cellulose. However the thickness of the adsorption layer on cellulose of a CPAM solution pre-equilibrated in NaCl is much higher, because the re-shrunk polymer coils do not relax as much upon adsorption. Deuterated cellulose film having better contrast for neutron reflectometry is investigated. Incorporation of deuterium into bacterial cellulose is achieved by growing Gluconacetobacter xylinus - strain ATCC 53524 in a mixture of deuterated glucose and deuterated glycerol. Two strategies are compared for synthesizing deuterated cellulose derivatives that are soluble in volatile solvents (acetone and toluene) suitable for spin coating: one involves acetylation in acetic anhydride, the other trimethylsilylation in ionic liquid (1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride). The trimethylsilylation of deuterated cellulose results in a much higher yield of product, and is used to prepare toluene solutions for spin-coating onto smooth flat silicon substrates. The resulting thin film is hydrolysed back to deuterated cellulose using hydrogen chloride vapour. The data generated is used to prepare improved substrate papers for use in PADs with high wet strength, controlled structure and fine-tuned surface properties...|$|E

40|$|Dexterous multi-fingered {{hands are}} {{extremely}} versatile {{and provide a}} generic way to perform multiple tasks in human-centric environments. However, effectively controlling them remains challenging due to their high dimensionality and large number of potential <b>contacts.</b> Deep <b>reinforcement</b> learning (DRL) provides a model-agnostic approach to control complex dynamical systems, but has not been shown to scale to high-dimensional dexterous manipulation. Furthermore, deployment of DRL on physical systems remains challenging due to sample inefficiency. Thus, the success of DRL in robotics has thus far been limited to simpler manipulators and tasks. In this work, we show that model-free DRL with natural policy gradients can effectively scale up to complex manipulation tasks with a high-dimensional 24 -DoF hand, and solve them from scratch in simulated experiments. Furthermore, {{with the use of}} a small number of human demonstrations, the sample complexity can be significantly reduced, and enable learning within the equivalent of a few hours of robot experience. We demonstrate successful policies for multiple complex tasks: object relocation, in-hand manipulation, tool use, and door opening. Comment: Project page: [URL]...|$|R

Dry sliding wear tests were carried out on graphite reinforced Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs) and its matrix alloy sliding against a steel counter face. Different <b>contact</b> stresses, <b>reinforcement</b> percentages, sliding distances and sliding velocities were selected as control factors and the response selected was Wear Volume Loss (WVL) and Coefficient of Friction (COF) to evaluate the dry sliding performance. An L 25 orthogonal array was employed for the experimental design. Initially empirical relations were deduced for WVL and COF in terms of control factors. Further, the optimal combination of the testing parameters was determined for WVL and COF by implementing Taguchi method for the experimental studies. Finally Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed to know the impact of individual factors on the WVL and COF. The results indicated that the sliding distance for WVL, sliding distance and reinforcement percentage for COF was found to be most effective factor among the other control parameters on dry sliding wear...|$|R

40|$|Behavioural {{activation}} (BA) therapy (Lejuez, Hopko, & Hopko, 2001; Martell, Addis, & Jacobson, 2001) {{is based}} on operant behavioural principles and involves efforts {{to increase the amount}} of ‘meaningful’ activity in the client’s everyday life, so that he or she increases <b>contact</b> with positive <b>reinforcement</b> for clinically-healthy behaviours while also decreasing <b>contact</b> with negative <b>reinforcement</b> for ‘depressed’ or ‘anxious’ behaviours. BA is an effective treatment for depression, yet rarely has been applied to anxiety despite functional similarities including the habitual avoidance that is a feature of both disorders. In this study Behavioural Activation Treatment of Anxiety (BATA) was evaluated across a series of single-case replications involving seven adults, each of whom met criteria for clinical anxiety. In each case, following a baseline period, BATA was delivered in twelve weekly 60 -minute individual sessions. The effects of the treatment were evaluated using an A-B-C phase change with repeated measurement design. Dependent variables were self-monitored daily anxiety and activity levels, self-reported anxiety, and the participants’ ratings of the ‘therapeutic relationship’ between themselves and the BATA therapist. A measure of treatment integrity was used. In six of the seven cases significant changes in daily activity levels and clinically significant decreases in anxiety were reported during the treatment phase. In five of those six cases, decreases in anxiety matched decreases in self-monitored daily anxiety. Reductions in anxiety were maintained up to a 3 -month follow-up. Overall, participants rated the therapeutic relationship as just approaching ‘adequate’ and these ratings appeared not to be associated with the changes in anxiety and activity levels across the course of treatment. The treatment integrity data showed that the therapist’s behaviour followed the treatment protocol. Overall, the results of the study were promising and showed that BATA can provide effective treatment for chronic anxiety problems in adults...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{effective}} way to strengthen deteriorated concrete or masonry structures is to glue to them, at critical regions, strips or plates made of Fiber Reinforced Polymers (FRP). The reliability of this technique depends upon interfacial adhesion, whose performance is usually evaluated through an energetic balance, assuming that the support is rigid. The present study analyzes the <b>contact</b> problem between <b>reinforcement</b> and substrate, both assumed to be linear elastic. The solution of the resulting integral equations is {{expressed in terms of}} Chebyshev polynomials. A generalization to this problem of the Crack Closure Integral Method developed by Irwin allows to calculate the energy release rate associated with the debonding of the stiffener. Energetic balance à la Griffith emphasizes the role played by the length of the stiffener and the deformation of the substrate, predicting load vs. displacement curves that, in agreement with experimental measurements, exhibit a snap-back phase...|$|R

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients harboring an imipenem-resistant A.  baumannii strain were defined as case patients. We described case occurrence and steps taken to control the outbreak: <b>contact</b> isolation, <b>reinforcement</b> of hygiene procedures, unit shutdown decision, unit disinfection, and reopening. We also made a case control study and a cost analysis of the outbreak management. RESULTS: During a 10 -day period, five patients were positive for a single clone of imipenem-resistant oxa- 23 A.  baumannii. Four patients presented with ventilation-acquired pneumonia and one was asymptomatic. The first two patients died one day after the first swab which led to the identification of A.  baumannii. No additional case was noted in the ICU or in other hospital units after deciding to close the ICU. The cost of outbreak management was estimated at 264, 553 euros. The case control study identified several factors associated with infection or colonization: length of stay in the ICU, chronic respiratory disease, number of previous antibiotic classes used, duration of ventilation, prone position, echocardiography, and presence of a nasogastric tube. CONCLUSION: This outbreak occurred during the summer period requiring the shutdown of the ICU and inducing a considerable cost. Rapid reactions of the ICU staff during the outbreak enabled to limit the epidemic...|$|R
40|$|A {{recipe for}} {{dissolving}} incipient species into {{a continuum of}} phenotypes is to recombine their genetic material. Therefore, students of speciation have become increasingly interested in the mechanisms by which recombination between locally adapted lineages is reduced. Evidence abounds that chromosomal rearrangements, via their suppression of recombination during meiosis in hybrids, {{play a major role}} in adaptation and speciation. By contrast, genic modifiers of recombination rates have been largely ignored in studies of speciation. We show how both types of reduction in recombination rates facilitate divergence in the face of gene flow, including the early stages of adaptive divergence, the persistence of species after secondary <b>contact,</b> and <b>reinforcement.</b> An often-overlooked connection between the evolution of sexual recombination and the origin of new species with gene flow suggests that the conditions for speciation with gene flow may be less restrictive than previously anticipated. Evolutionary scenarios for which mathematical models predict selection for reduced recombination can provide insights into how ecological speciation and reinforcement can proceed. Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of recombination in eukaryotes have provided first insights into how recombination rates can be modified within and between species. In addition to the well-established role of chromosomal inversions during speciation, more subtle changes in recombination rates through modifier genes influencing the frequencies and distributions of crossover across the genome might also be important. A better understanding of genomic patterns of differentiation during speciation could be gained by taking into account that recombination rates can themselves evolve...|$|R
40|$|The {{divergence}} of Drosophila pseudoobscura {{and close}} relatives D. persimilis and D. pseudoobscura bogotana {{has been studied}} using comparative DNA sequence data from multiple nuclear loci. New data from the Hsp 82 and Adh regions, in conjunction with existing data from Adh and the Period locus, are examined {{in the light of}} various models of speciation. The principal finding is that the three loci present very different histories, with Adh indicating large amounts of recent gene flow among the taxa, while little or no gene flow is apparent in the data from the other loci. The data were compared with predictions from several isolation models of divergence. These models include no gene flow, and they were found to be incompatible with the data. Instead the DNA data, taken together with other evidence, seem consistent with divergence models in which natural selection acts against gene flow at some loci more than at others. This family of models includes some sympatric and parapatric speciation models, as well as models of secondary <b>contact</b> and subsequent <b>reinforcement</b> of sexual isolation...|$|R
40|$|In {{a series}} of three experiments, groups of food-deprived and water-deprived rats were given pairings of a {{retractable}} lever (CS+) with response-independent deliveries of either solid or liquid reinforcers. In Experiment 1 food-deprived rats given a solid-pellet reinforcer differentially tended to sniff, paw, mouth, and bite the CS+ lever more often than a lever that was not paired with food (CS−), whereas food-deprived rats given a liquid reinforcer tended to differentially sniff, paw, and lick the CS+ lever. 23 ½-hour water-deprived rats given liquid reinforcers showed very little CS+ contact. In Experiment 2 increasing the severity of water deprivation from 23 ½ to 47 ½ hours significantly increased CS+ contact. In Experiment 3, subjects that were simultaneously food and water deprived and given a water reinforcer failed to exhibit differential CS+ contact, but subjects that were simultaneously food and water deprived and given a food reinforcer did acquire differential CS+-contact behavior. These results suggest that (a) even under a single motivational state the nature of signal-centered behavior can be determined by type of reinforcer, (b) although water reinforcement produces less signal <b>contact</b> than food <b>reinforcement,</b> this can be facilitated with more severe water-deprivation levels, and (c) high CS-contact rates using food reinforcement are not simply a product of reductions in body weight with food deprivation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} the epidemiology of a protracted nosocomial clonal outbreak due to multidrug-resistant IMP- 8 producing Klebsiella oxytoca (MDRKO) that was finally eradicated by removing an environmental reservoir. The outbreak {{occurred in the}} ICU of a Spanish hospital from March 2009 to November 2011 and evolved over four waves. Forty-two patients were affected. First basic (active surveillance, <b>contact</b> precautions and <b>reinforcement</b> of surface cleaning) and later additional control measures (nurse cohorting and establishment of a minimum patient/nurse ratio) were implemented. Screening of ICU staff was repeatedly negative. Initial environmental cultures, including dry surfaces, were also negative. The above measures temporarily controlled cross-transmission but failed to eradicate the epidemic MDRKO strain that reappeared {{two weeks after the}} last colonized patients in waves 2 and 3 had been discharged. Therefore, an occult environmental reservoir was suspected. Samples from the drainpipes and traps of a sink were positive; removal of the sink reduced the rate number but did not stop new cases that clustered in a cubicle whose horizontal drainage system was connected with the eliminated sink. The elimination of the horizontal drainage system finally eradicated the outbreak. In conclusion, damp environmental reservoirs (mainly sink drains, traps and the horizontal drainage system) could explain why standard cross-transmission control measures failed to control the outbreak; such reservoirs should be considered even when environmental cultures of surfaces are negative...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) can colonize {{or cause}} infections in high-risk {{patients}} and contaminate the environment. Our {{objective was to}} describe the epidemiological investigation of an outbreak of VRE, the interventions made, {{and their impact on}} its control. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, descriptive, non-comparative study by reviewing the charts of patients with a VRE-positive culture in the University Hospital of Campinas State University, comprising 380 beds, 40 of which were in intensive care units (ICUs), who were admitted from February 2008 -January 2009. Interventions were divided into educational activity, reviewing the workflow processes, engineering measures, and administrative procedures. Results: There were 150 patients, 139 (92. 7 %) colonized and 11 (7. 3 %) infected. Seventy-three percent were cared for in non-ICUs (p = 0. 028). Infection was more frequent in patients with a central-line (p = 0. 043), mechanical ventilation (p = 0. 013), urinary catheter (p = 0. 049), or surgical drain (p = 0. 049). Vancomycin, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and third-generation cephalosporin were previously used by 47 (31. 3 %), 31 (20. 7 %), 24 (16 %), and 24 (16 %) patients, respectively. Death was more frequent in infected (73 %) than in colonized (17 %) patients (p < 0. 001). After the interventions, the attack rate fell from 1. 49 to 0. 33 (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Classical risk factors for VRE colonization or infection, e. g., being cared for in an ICU and previous use of vancomycin, were not found in this study. The conjunction of an educational program, strict adhesion to <b>contact</b> precautions, and <b>reinforcement</b> of environmental cleaning were able to prevent the dissemination of VRE...|$|R
40|$|MacGREGOR (SWE) AB (Crane Division) {{is located}} in Örnsköldsvik and {{provides}} cranes handling cargo on ships and in ports with capacities ranging from 3 - 500 tonnes. When MacGREGOR (SWE) AB (Crane Division) sells a crane the design {{must be approved by}} a classification society. One of the classification societies did not approve the design on one of the foundation types MacGREGOR (SWE) AB (Crane Division) uses. The reinforcements used today are designed and implemented by demands from the classification society Germanischer Lloyd. The problem with these reinforcements is the design, which increases the manufacturing time and cost. Therefore the purpose with this thesis is to analyze the current design, examine the need of the reinforcements and if necessary design a new reinforcement. At the beginning of the project focus was on gathering information about how and why the reinforcements are used today. Unfortunately there has been no opportunity to have <b>contact</b> with the <b>reinforcement</b> designer Germanischer Lloyd. Instead the knowledge about the reinforcement, how and why they exist, come from interviews with well-informed personnel at MacGREGOR (SWE) AB (Crane Division). To investigate how the reinforcements affect the stress distribution on the foundation, a simplified model of the whole crane with bearing, crane house and crane arm was modeled. Finite element analyses in I-deas were performed on the model with eight node sheet elements. The result from the first simulations showed that the reinforcements were unnecessary. These simulations led the thesis into further analyses instead of designing a new reinforcement. Further analyses show that the reinforcement lowers the stress in the foundation at the worst places with ≈ 12 %. The result led to analyses with different thicknesses of both the foundations sheet case and also the reinforcement ring. By having a thicker plates in the sheet case of the foundation the stress lowers in a satisfying way, but the total weight and the material cost increases. By increasing the thickness of the reinforcement ring the stress decreases and a safety margin of 1. 5 can be retained. The increase in material cost that a thicker reinforcement ring results in is lower than the cost of the stiff plates that are used today. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|The current design {{method for}} MSE walls, based on limit state analysis, {{may not be}} {{appropriate}} under undrained conditions. Laboratory and numerical pullout tests are performed to determine drained and undrained pullout capacities for different soil types (clean sand, 5, 10, 15 and 35 % silty sand) and overburden pressures (30, 100 and 200 kPa). Pullout experiments are conducted on a large pullout box with dimension of 1. 5 m long, 0. 5 m high, and 0. 4 m wide, where a single steel inclusion is placed with a mass of soil compacted at 95 % Proctor. The results of the pullout tests show that both drained and undrained pullout capacities depend on the silt content and increase with the internal friction angle of the soil and with the overburden pressure. Undrained conditions may reduce the pullout capacity. This reduction {{is caused by the}} generation of excess pore pressures in the soil under rapid loading which in turn decrease the effective normal stress at the soil-reinforcement interface. The ratio of undrained to drained pullout capacity changes with silt content and overburden pressure; for 100 and 200 kPa, the ratio is 1. 0 for clean sand (i. e. no reduction), 0. 67 ∼ 0. 69 for 5 %, 0. 77 ∼ 0. 78 for 10 %, 0. 72 ∼ 0. 73 for 15 %, and 0. 57 ∼ 0. 59 for 35 % silty sand. For a 30 kPa, the ratio is 1. 0 for clean sand, 0. 5 for 5 %, 0. 67 for 10 %, 0. 78 for 15 %, and 0. 72 for 35 % silty sand. The magnitude of the pullout reduction is also dependent on the permeability of the soil and pullout rate. For large permeabilities, the dissipation of excess pore pressures is very rapid and no reduction is produced. In contrast, for low permeabilities, excess pore pressures are generated faster than they dissipate. Numerical simulations with a FEM with an elasto-plastic soil model reproduce well the experiment observations, with difference within experimental error. The simulations show that the deformations of the soil in <b>contact</b> with the <b>reinforcement</b> are very small, which indicates that yielding in the soil does not occur. Because of this the more important factor for pullout capacity is the coefficient of friction at the interface. ...|$|R
