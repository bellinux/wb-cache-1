5|$|A 2017 {{systematic}} review found <b>consistent</b> evidence that circumcision {{was associated with}} a decreased risk of cervical cancer, cervical dysplasia, HSV-2, chlamydia, and syphilis among women. The evidence was less <b>consistent</b> in regards to the potential association of circumcision with women's risk of HPV and HIV.|$|E
5|$|According to cosmochemist Larry Grossman of the University of Chicago, {{the aerial}} lights and explosions {{reported}} were <b>consistent</b> with extraterrestrial material.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} only a handful of <b>consistent</b> {{superstring}} theories, it remained a mystery why there was not just one <b>consistent</b> formulation. However, as physicists began to examine string theory more closely, they realized that these theories are related in intricate and nontrivial ways.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{computers}} {{are used in}} the Runway offices, <b>consistent</b> with many real publishing companies.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} study has {{associated}} CS exposure with miscarriages. This is <b>consistent</b> with its reported clastogenic effect (abnormal chromosome change) on mammalian cells.|$|E

5|$|Compositional {{information}} from the visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR), gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND), and framing camera (FC), all indicate {{that the majority of}} the surface composition of Vesta is <b>consistent</b> with the composition of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite meteorites. The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, <b>consistent</b> with the Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta. The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also be <b>consistent</b> with excavation of mantle material. However, olivine has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia. The origin of this olivine is currently uncertain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Consistent</b> with a {{statement}} given in May 2017, the LDS Church announced on September 28, 2017 that Monson would not attend the church's upcoming general conference, due to age-related limitations.|$|E

5|$|Fine-scale {{variation}} (e.g. variation {{along the}} orbit of the Lunar Prospector orbiter) of the lunar gravitational field, which is <b>consistent</b> with geologic processes involving a crust, mantle, and core.|$|E

5|$|Haworth has {{designed}} a tablebase that produces results <b>consistent</b> with the fifty-move rule. However most tablebases {{search for the}} theoretical limits of forced mate, even if it requires several hundred moves.|$|E
5|$|His long {{acknowledged}} {{learning disability}} {{and a possible}} intellectual disability have both been linked to his severe epilepsy; recent speculation finds some behaviours <b>consistent</b> with autism.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Zhou {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} that P. lujiatunensis is basal {{to all other}} species. This would be <b>consistent</b> with its earlier appearance in the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Sauerbrunn was a <b>consistent</b> starter at the center-back position. She started 10 of her 12 {{appearances}} during 2013, {{playing a}} total of 940 minutes.|$|E
5|$|In sheep, {{position}} in a moving flock is highly correlated with social dominance, {{but there is no}} definitive study to show <b>consistent</b> voluntary leadership by an individual sheep.|$|E
5|$|No stops are {{scheduled}} at 3m, {{as it is}} considered too difficult to maintain a <b>consistent</b> depth in waves.|$|E
5|$|On 30 August 2013, CELSA Group bought both Llanishen and Lisvane {{reservoirs}} {{from their}} owner Western Power Distribution, to assure its Cardiff rod mill plant a <b>consistent</b> {{supply of water}} from Lisvane.|$|E
5|$|Poverty {{remains a}} <b>consistent</b> problem in Newark, despite its {{revitalization}} in recent years. As of 2010, roughly {{one-third of the}} city's population was impoverished.|$|E
5|$|Since {{forces are}} {{perceived}} as pushes or pulls, this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces. As with other physical concepts (e.g. temperature), the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions that are <b>consistent</b> with direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale. Through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully <b>consistent</b> with the conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Stefano Garzelli was {{the winner}} of the {{mountains}} classification, gaining points for <b>consistent</b> high placings on the summit stage finishes, as well as a brief breakaway on the mountainous stage 10. The points classification was won by Di Luca, after he finished in the top ten in eight of the road stages. The youth classification was won by Kevin Seeldraeyers, who remained <b>consistent</b> after Thomas Lövkvist lost nearly 25 minutes on stage 16. Lövkvist had, for one day earlier in the race, led not just the youth but also the general classification.|$|E
5|$|The Iron Age {{began in}} Scotland from about {{the seventh century}} BCE. From this point there are the first finds of iron {{artifacts}} in hoards that are <b>consistent</b> containing other items that are <b>consistent</b> with Bronze Age practice. {{there is also evidence}} of smithing and smelting on some settlement sites. Iron Age society in Scotland shared many traits with Southern Britain, Ireland and in some cases continental Europe. These included roundhouses and enclosed and fortified settlements, but it also contained elements of independent development.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} where both pieces were retrieved {{was found to}} be <b>consistent</b> with the drift model performed by CSIRO, further corroborating they could have come from Flight 370.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} that Menkauhor {{had the time to}} complete his pyramid, whose small dimensions are thus <b>consistent</b> with his short eight to nine years of reign.|$|E

5|$|While the Olympic Games have {{experienced}} tremendous growth in global media coverage since the 1984 Summer Olympics, the Paralympics {{have been unable}} to maintain a <b>consistent</b> international media presence.|$|E
5|$|Wright met Darwin in {{the early}} 1760s, {{probably}} through their common connection of John Whitehurst, first consulting Darwin about ill health in 1767 when {{he stayed in the}} Darwin household for a week. The energy and vivacity of both Erasmus and Mary (Polly) Darwin impressed Wright. In the 1980s Eric Evans (National Gallery) suggested that Darwin is the figure in the left foreground who holds a watch. As this composed timekeeper is not <b>consistent</b> with Darwin's flamboyant character, {{it is more likely that}} this is Dr William Small. The attention to timekeeping fits with Dr Small's role as the social secretary for the Lunar circle. Small returned from Virginia in 1764 and established his practice in Birmingham in 1765, <b>consistent</b> with this being a meeting in 1767. The profile and wig of this figure are <b>consistent</b> with a contemporary portrait of Small by Tilly Kettle.|$|E

5|$|Definitions of mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (MTBI) were inconsistent until the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) provided a <b>consistent,</b> authoritative definition across specialties in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Flying an {{overloaded}} American International Airways aircraft from Miami, Florida to Maiquetia, Venezuela on 26 May 1994. The {{degree of}} overloading was <b>consistent</b> with ground crew reading the kilogram markings on the cargo as pounds.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, one of {{the proponents}} of an archaeological date, Felix Höflmayer, argued that archaeological {{evidence}} could be <b>consistent</b> with a date as early as 1590 BCE, reducing the discrepancy to around 50 years.|$|E
