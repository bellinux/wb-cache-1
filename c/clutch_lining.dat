40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Clutch take-up judder is a {{torsional}} vibration phenomenon induced by stick-slip oscillations at the friction lining interfaces between the clutch friction disc and the flywheel and pressure plate surfaces {{during the process}} of clutch engagement. This is short-lived transient phenomenon affected by the <b>clutch</b> <b>lining</b> material’s friction characteristics, topography of the mating-sliding surfaces and operational conditions during engagement such as contact pressure, interfacial slip speed and contact temperature. The phenomenon leads to driver discomfort as well as gradual wear of contacting surfaces, even if short-lived. Its frequency is is usually reported to be in the range 5 - 20 Hz depending on the vehicle type. The friction characteristics alter in a transient manner during engagement and it should be measured under controlled conditions. In this paper the measured interfacial friction characteristics together with clamp load variation (contact pressure) under different surface temperatures are included in a multi-degree of freedom dynamic analysis to obtain torsional vibrations of the system, pertaining to take up judder conditions. Such an in-depth investigation has not hitherto been reported in literature. The paper shows that take up stick-slip judder is omnipresent under all clutch engagement conditions, but its poignancy is most evident at cold surface temperatures. It is also shown that the transient judder response has a broader spectral content that is generally understood...|$|E

40|$|Using {{light and}} {{scanning}} electron microscopy, a sensory field consisting of 15 - 20 campaniform sensillae is {{described on the}} base of the stylus of the endophytic ovipositor of Odonata. It is hypothesised that two symmetric styli equipped with this number of sensillae can function as a mechanosensory organ responsible for control of precise egg positioning in plant stems during oviposition. In laboratory experiments with females of damselflies Lestes sponsa and Lestes barbarus (Lestidae), it was demonstrated that the distance between laid eggs is not dependent on the presence of styli. Removal of styli from both sides did not influence a shift of oviposition to one side. Females with one removed stylus shifted the <b>clutch</b> <b>line</b> in the opposite direction toward the removed stylus. Additionally, removal of styli influenced positions of single eggs in egg sets, and disturbed the capacity for complex oviposition. Thus., both morphological and experimental data support the hypothesis that styli participate in the control of egg line and egg patterning in the clutch. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

25|$|To {{adapt the}} BMW M52 engine to the Defender chassis, the {{engineers}} {{were able to}} utilize some of the parts from the recently developed BMW M51 diesel powered Range Rover 2.5 DSE. They used the clutch housing, clutch, flywheel, and slave cylinder from that vehicle to connect the engine to the R380 gearbox, {{but they had to}} produce a new clutch housing adaptor (bell housing) for the petrol M52 engine in the Defender. The unique clutch housing adaptor was necessary because the petrol M52 engine is tilted 10 degrees compared to the diesel M51 engine and it needed to be longer to match the input shaft of the R380 gearbox borrowed from the 300Tdi Defender. Due to the large diameter gearbox input shaft, the standard BMW pilot bearing could not be fitted, so a unique pilot bushing made of Oilite bronze was developed. It had an inside diameter of 7/8 inch with an outside diameter of 32mm. A mixture of non-metric and metric specifications are common on Land Rovers. Other unique parts that were developed for the 2.8i were the air intake ducts {{both before and after the}} Donaldson FPG RadialSeal™ air cleaner, engine mounts, radiator cowl, cooling hoses, fuel <b>lines,</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>lines,</b> air conditioning system, engine wiring, tachometer gauge, exhaust system, and a specially tuned Siemens MS41.0 DME with a Lucas 10AS alarm in place of the Drive Away Protection system (EWS) used on BMWs. There were also major changes for the 1999 model year, which included updated instrumentation, different chassis and engine wiring, an updated cooling system with aluminum radiator, and an updated fuel system with new fuel tank. The 1.667:1 gear ratio LT230 transfer box gave the vehicle a “rev happy” nature which delighted many off-road enthusiasts and made the vehicle particularly well suited for traversing a wide range of grueling terrain such as sand dunes. The high gear ratio also helped the 2.8i sprint from 0–100km/h in 9.3 seconds, making it the fastest production Defender ever made.|$|R

5000|$|The Telstar 28 has {{a number}} of {{distinguishing}} features, when comparing to the earlier versions as well as other foldable trimarans. Most notable is the folding mechanism for the amas. The amas fold in, by swiveling in and out alongside the main hull, reducing the beam from 18 ft to 8 ft 6 in, without extending the boat's overall length. The amas submerse approximately an additional four inches when retracted but retain their orientation to the main hull, so no additional surface is exposed to fouling if the amas were painted for the retracted waterline. This allows the boat to be berthed in a standard marina slip for extended period of time, eliminating one of the main problems facing trimaran owners. The folding mechanism is locked in the in or out position by a pair of <b>line</b> <b>clutches</b> in each cockpit locker, where one line controls the tension of the trampolines and the other actually locks the ama in position.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine house spar-row response to lines spaced about 37 cm apart around nest boxes. One hundred forty-six nest boxes were installed, with lines randomly assigned to 73 boxes. All nest boxes were checked approximately every 5 days for nest materials, eggs, nestlings, and fledglings. Successful clutches were record-ed for nests that fledged at least one bird. Results indicated no difference between the numbers of treated and control nest boxes that had nest materials (70 control, 66 treat-ed), but onset of the first set of clutches was earlier (- 13 days) in control than in treated nest boxes (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). In addition, there were more control nest boxes with eggs present (51 control, 34 treated, P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and more control nest boxes with at least 1 (39 control, 21 treated, P 3 ̆c 0. 05) or 2 (24 con-trol, 6 treated, P 3 ̆c 0. 05) successful <b>clutches.</b> Although, monofilament <b>lines</b> do not repel house sparrows from nest boxes as they do from feeding sites, they do appear to reduce the number of clutches and fledglings.

40|$|An {{autonomous}} vehicle is {{a vehicle that}} is capable of navigating and driving with no human intervention whatsoever through the utilization of various sensors and positioning systems. The possible applications of {{autonomous vehicle}}s are widespread, ranging from the aerospace industry to the mining and military sectors where the exposure of human operators to the operating conditions is hazardous to their health and safety. Automobile accidents have become {{the leading cause of death}} in certain segments of the world population. Removing the human driver from the decision-making process through automation may result in significantly safer highways. Although full autonomy may be the ultimate goal, there is huge scope for systems that aid the driver in decision making or systems that take over from the driver under conditions where the human driver fails. The aim of the longitudinal control system to be implemented on the Land Rover test vehicle in this study is to improve the vehicle’s safety by controlling the vehicle’s longitudinal behaviour. A common problem with sports-utility-vehicles is the low rollover threshold, due to a high centre of gravity. Rather than modifying the vehicle to increase the rollover threshold, the aim of the control system presented here is to prevent the vehicle from exceeding speeds that would cause the vehicle to reach its rollover threshold. In order to develop a control system that autonomously controls the longitudinal degree of freedom, a model of the test vehicle (a 1997 Land Rover Defender 110 Wagon) was developed in MSC. ADAMS/View and validated experimentally. The model accurately captures the response of the test vehicle to supply forces as generated by the engine and demand forces applied through drag, braking and engine braking. Furthermore, the model has been validated experimentally to provide reliable simulation results for lateral and vertical dynamics. The control system was developed by generating a reference speed that the vehicle must track. This reference speed was formulated by taking into account the vehicle’s limits due to lateral acceleration, combined lateral and longitudinal acceleration and the vehicle’s performance capabilities. The control system generates the desired throttle pedal position, hydraulic pressure in the brake <b>lines,</b> <b>clutch</b> position and gear selection as output. The MSC. ADAMS model of the test vehicle was used to evaluate the performance of the control system on various racetracks of which the GPS coordinates were available. The simulation results indicate that the control system performs as expected. Finally, the control system was implemented on the test vehicle and the performance was evaluated by conducting field tests in the form of a severe double lane change manoeuvre. The results of the field tests indicated that the control system limited the acceleration vector of the vehicle’s centre of gravity to prescribed limits, as predicted by the simulation results.
