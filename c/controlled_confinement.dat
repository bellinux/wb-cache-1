It {{was designed to}} house terrorists as well as problematic prisoners which had been identified as difficult offenders within the NSW prison system, replacing the intractable section at Grafton Gaol. It was dubbed as an ‘electronic zoo' by inmates due to its electronically <b>controlled</b> <b>confinement</b> with artificial lights and air, depriving inmates from almost all contact from the outside world. [...] The facility with its 40 prison cells had electronically operated doors, accompanied by several surveillance cameras, which were to supplement the existent security facilities within the unit. Although the unit did not have windows, it was serviced by a fully integrated air-conditioning system which circulated fresh air throughout. Additionally, inmates were permitted to engage in physical exercise in two purpose-built yards situated {{at each end of}} the unit. Several 'blind spots' that were not corrected during the initial design and construction of the facility led to escapes by inmates, including Russell 'Mad Dog' Cox, an armed robber and hostage-taker, who escaped after cutting through a bar on the roof of one of the exercise yards.|$|E

We hypothesized that high protein intake (animal:vegetable protein ratio: 60 : 40), isocaloric, {{compared to the}} control group plus high potassium intake would prevent IR without affecting bone turnover. After a 20 -day ambulatory adaptation to <b>controlled</b> <b>confinement</b> and diet, 16 women participated in a 60 -day, 6 deg head-down-tilt BR and were assigned randomly {{to one of the}} two groups. Control subjects (CON, n= 8) received 1 g/kg body mass/d dietary protein. Nutrition subjects (NUT, n= 8) received 1. 45 g/kg body mass/d dietary protein plus 7. 2 g branched chain amino acids per day during BR. All subjects received 1670 kcal/d. Bed rest decreased glucose disposal by 35 % (p 30 %) and Ntelopeptide (> 20 %) (both: p< 0. 001). Bone formation markers were unaffected by high protein intake. We conclude from these results that high protein intake might positively affect glucose tolerance, but might also foster bone loss.

40|$|Photoactive NiO {{electrodes}} for cathodic dye-sensitised {{solar cells}} (p-DSCs) {{have been prepared}} with thicknesses ranging between 0. 4 and 3. 0 mm by spray-depositing pre-formed NiO nanoparticles on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates. The larger thicknesses were obtained in sequential sintering steps using a conventional furnace (CS) and a newly developed rapid discharge sintering (RDS) method. The latter procedure is employed {{for the first time}} for the preparation of p-DSCs. In particular, RDS represents a scalable procedure that is based on microwave-assisted plasma formation that allows the production in series of mesoporous NiO electrodes with large surface areas for p-type cell photocathodes. RDS possesses the unique feature of transmitting heat from the bulk of the system towards its outer interfaces with <b>controlled</b> <b>confinement</b> of the heating zone. The use of RDS results in a drastic reduction of processing times with respect to other deposition methods that involve heating/calcination steps with associated reduced costs in terms of energy. P 1 -dye sensitized NiO electrodes obtained via the RDS procedure have been tested in DSC devices and their performances have been analysed and compared with those of cathodic DSCs derived from CS-deposited samples. The largest conversion eﬃciencies (0. 12 %) and incident photon-to-current conversion eﬃciencies, IPCEs (50 %), were obtained with sintered NiO electrodes having thicknesses of B 1. 5 – 2. 0 mm. In all the devices, the photogenerated holes in NiO live significantly longer (th B 1 s) than have previously been reported for P 1 -sensitized NiO photocathodes.

40|$|This work {{is devoted}} to {{investigate}} light confinement in rolled-up microtubular cavities and their optofluidic applications. The microcavities are fabricated by a roll-up mechanism based on releasing pre-strained silicon-oxide nanomembranes. By defining the shape and thickness of the nanomembranes, the geometrical tube structure is well controlled. Micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy at room temperature is employed to study the optical modes and their dependence on the structural characteristics of the microtubes. Finite-difference-time-domain simulations are performed to elucidate the experimental results. In addition, a theoretical model (based on a wave description) is applied to describe the optical modes in the tubular microcavities, supporting quantitatively and qualitatively the experimental findings. Precise spectral tuning of the optical modes is achieved by two post-fabrication methods. One method employs conformal coating of the tube wall with Al 2 O 3 monolayers by atomic-layer-deposition, which permits a mode tuning over a wide spectral range (larger than one free-spectral-range). An average mode tuning to longer wavelengths of 0. 11 nm/ Al 2 O 3 -monolayer is obtained. The other method consists in asymmetric material deposition onto the tube surface. Besides the possibility of mode tuning, this method permits to detect small shape deformations (at the nanometer scale) of an optical microcavity. <b>Controlled</b> <b>confinement</b> of resonant light is demonstrated by using an asymmetric cone-like microtube, which is fabricated by unevenly rolling-up circular-shaped nanomembranes. Localized three-dimensional optical modes are obtained due to an axial confinement mechanism that {{is defined by the}} variation of the tube radius and wall windings along the tube axis. Optofluidic functions of the rolled-up microtubes are explored by immersing the tubes or filling their core with a liquid medium. Refractive index sensing of liquids is demonstrated by correlating spectral shift of the optical modes when a liquid interacts with the resonant light of the microtube. In addition, a novel sensing methodology is proposed by monitoring axial mode spacing changes. Lab-on-a-chip methods are employed to fabricate an optofluidic chip device, allowing a high degree of liquid handling. A maximum sensitivity of 880 nm/refractive-index-unit is achieved. The developed optofluidic sensors show high potential for lab-on-a-chip applications, such as real-time bio/chemical analytic systems...|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{of energy}} {{expenditures}} for domestic animals {{are used as}} a basis to determine the total energy requirements for maintenance and for production. Most studies on energy metabolism have been conducted under <b>controlled,</b> <b>confinement</b> conditions, and the results extrapolated to free - ranging animals. Such approaches do not always represent the real energy costs of free existence in the range or pasture environment. This study compared energy expenditures of sheep and goats under free-grazing conditions and assessed {{the accuracy of the}} carbon dioxide entry rate technique (CERT) as compared to the oxygen consumption method. In addition, 24 -hour activity budgets were used to construct energy budgets for both animal species. These estimates were compared to CERT measurements. Dietary organic matter, crude protein, gross energy, digestible protein, and digestible energy intakes, as well as the apparent digestibility coefficients for crude protein and gross energy were compared for both species in one of the grazing trials. The validation of CERT yielded the linear regression equation: Y = 0. 878 + 5. 333 ER where Y energy expenditure in Kcal·min- 1, and ER is the C 02 entry rate in grams of C 02 carbon·min- 1. The coefficient of determination (r 2) was 0. 979, and the residual standard deviation of ± 0. 12 Kcal·min- 1. Daily energy expenditure of goats was higher (P 3 ̆c. OS) than that of sheep in all grazing experiments. The overall means were 127. 1 and 88. 4 Kcal·Bw-. 75. d- 1 for goats and sheep, respectively. High ambient temperatures during one of the grazing trials apparently caused heat stress to the grazing animals. Both species responded to this situation by using behavioral adaptations and avoidance mechanisms. The energy budget method over-estimated energy expenditures of sheep by 9 percent, and grossly underestimated the energy expenditures of goats by 39 percent. The nutritive value of the diets selected by both species was similar. However, goats had higher (P 3 ̆c. OS) organic matter, crude protein, gross energy, digestible protein and digestible energy intakes. The apparent crude protein digestibility coefficient for goats was 20 percent higher (P 3 ̆c. OS) than that for sheep. On the other hand, gross energy digestibility coefficients were similar for both species. Goats appeared to have an edge in meeting their dietary protein requirements under free- ranging conditions. CERT can predict energy expenditures within ± 8 percent of the mean. It is a feasible technique for assessing energy expenditures of small ruminants under range conditions. The energy budget method was not reliable for estimating energy costs in small ruminants, especially goats...|$|E

The European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax, widely reared in the Mediterranean, is very sensitive to handling stress, so that typical rearing procedures during on-growing (e. g. grading) are avoided. The present study aimed at investigating whether exposure to blue (480 nm) or white light (BL or WL, respectively) could alleviate European sea bass acute stress response. Fish (initial weight 130. 9 +/- 0. 4 g) were reared (seawater recirculating system) for 63 days under BL or WL and then subjected to 1 hour confinement or left undisturbed (<b>control).</b> <b>Confinement</b> of fish under BL resulted in a higher cortisol increase, no dopaminergic activation and lower brain serotonergic activity than under WL. In contrast, WL confined fish showed a lower cortisol increase coupled with higher brain serotonergic activity and increased levels of brain dopamine. Stress-induced hematocrit increase was lower when fish were confined under BL and triacylglycerides increase was only observed for WL reared fish. Differences in some parameters between unstressed BL and WL fish suggest that light wavelength {{had an effect on}} fish physiological status irrespective of stress. Although present results are not conclusive on which fish groups were more or less stressed, they do confirm that light wavelength can differentiate European sea bass response to acute stressors. Further studies to elucidate biological mechanisms of light spectrum effects will reinforce its efficacy as a tool to manipulate intensively reared fish stress response. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

Macroscopic quantum phenomenon, Bose-Einstein condensation, has been realized and observed in two dimensional polariton systems utilizing the traditional distributed-Bragg-reflector based samples. Such foundational work on two-dimensional systems has inspired theoretical schemes for polariton-based quantum circuits, quantum light sources and novel quantum phases. Experimental implementation of these schemes requires the <b>control,</b> <b>confinement</b> and coupling of polariton systems, which still remain challenging in conventional microcavity structures. In this thesis, we use the sub-wavelength grating-based microcavities to demonstrate confinement and coupling for the polariton systems. We demonstrated a zero-dimensional polariton device in the sub-wavelength grating-based microcavity. Efficient confinement has been realized in such unconventional microcavity. These confinement features have also been observed in the spectroscopic characterization with discretized energy levels from the device. In addition, the polaritons are highly linear polarized, which is unique to the sub-wavelength grating based devices. The establishment of the polariton lasing/condensation was with non-linear increase of the emission intensity, line-width narrowing and continuous energy shift. Single-mode lasing of polaritons was also demonstrated for the first time. Following the work of single zero-dimensional polariton device, we demonstrated that the coupling among multiple zero-dimensional polariton quantum devices could be readily achieved, leading to de-coupled, coupled and quasi-one-dimensional polariton systems. These coupling effects were controlled and realized by design of the tethering patterns around the sub-wavelength grating based devices.
