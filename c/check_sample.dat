Results require confirmation to <b>check</b> <b>sample</b> identity, and analysis of parental samples to determine inheritance and thus assess the clinical significance of the abnormality. Here we describe an MLPA-based strategy for the follow-up of abnormal aCGH results. Results In the first 17 months of our MLPA-based aCGH follow-up service, 317 different custom MLPA probes for novel aCGH-detected abnormalities were developed for inheritance studies in 164 families. In addition, 110 samples were tested for confirmation of aCGH-detected abnormalities in common syndromic or subtelomeric regions using commercial MLPA kits. Overall, a total of 1215 samples have been tested by MLPA. A total of 72 de novo abnormalities were confirmed. Conclusions Confirmation of aCGH-detected abnormalities and inheritance of these abnormalities are essential for accurate diagnosis and interpretation of aCGH results.

Specific loaf volume of laboratory prepared gluten-free breads was in significant positive correlation with dough resistance (r = 0. 86), dough extensibility (r = 0. 98) and peak stress at the moment of dough rupture (r = 0. 96).

Since different plant types exhibit distinctive phytolith morphologies, their assemblages are used in identifying vegetation histories or food culture adaptations. A few direct 14 C-AMS measurements of phytoliths have been carried out, but these measurements are difficult due to the low concentrations of phytoliths in some plant species, and {{the small amount of}} C per phytolith (< 2 %). In addition, no phytoliths samples of a known 14 C age are available to verify measurement accuracy and precision, and to <b>check</b> <b>sample</b> preparation protocols.
