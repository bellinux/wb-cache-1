50|$|<b>Coasting</b> <b>is</b> another {{technique}} for increasing fuel efficiency. Shifting gears and/or restarting the engine increase {{the time required}} for an avoidance maneuver that requires acceleration. Therefore, some believe the reduction of control associated with <b>coasting</b> <b>is</b> an unacceptable risk.|$|R
5|$|The Jurassic <b>Coast</b> <b>is</b> {{subject to}} severe weather {{conditions}} at times. Violent storms occurred in 1824 and 1974, and these and various lesser storms have battered the cliffs and caused flooding and structural damage in coastal towns. The <b>coast</b> <b>is</b> largely an eroding landscape {{and management of}} the site aims to allow the natural processes of erosion to continue while protecting people and property. Coastal defences have been put in place in Charmouth and Weymouth, where houses are at risk, but in other places, where the coastline remains in a natural state, the management policy is to take no action and allow erosion to take its course.|$|E
5|$|At Lulworth Cove, {{the waves}} have cut {{their way through}} the {{resistant}} Portland stone and created a horseshoe-shaped cove by eroding the softer sands and clays behind. Another feature of this part of the <b>coast</b> <b>is</b> Durdle Door, a natural arch. Sea stacks and pinnacles, such as Old Harry Rocks at Handfast Point, have been formed by erosion of the chalk cliffs.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with County Donegal, Lough Swilly {{separates}} {{one side}} of the Inishowen peninsula. Lough Foyle on the other side, is one of Ireland's larger inlets, situated between County Donegal and County Londonderry. Further round the <b>coast</b> <b>is</b> Belfast Lough, between County Antrim and County Down. Also in County Down is Strangford Lough, actually an inlet partially separating the Ards peninsula from the mainland.

5|$|Corpus Christi Bay has a {{rich history}} of human {{settlement}} along its shores {{that dates back}} millennia and {{is responsible for the}} growth of Corpus Christi, and the smaller ports of Ingleside and Portland.

The bay's abundance of petroleum and natural gas has attracted industry, and its strategic location on the Texas <b>coast</b> <b>is</b> ideal for military establishment.|$|E
5|$|The Adriatic Sea {{sits on the}} Apulian or Adriatic Microplate, which {{separated}} from the African Plate in the Mesozoic era. The plate's movement contributed {{to the formation of}} the surrounding mountain chains and Apennine tectonic uplift after its collision with the Eurasian plate. In the Late Oligocene, the Apennine Peninsula first formed, separating the Adriatic Basin {{from the rest of the}} Mediterranean. All types of sediment are found in the Adriatic, with the bulk of the material transported by the Po and other rivers on the western coast. The western <b>coast</b> <b>is</b> alluvial or terraced, while the eastern <b>coast</b> <b>is</b> highly indented with pronounced karstification. There are dozens of marine protected areas in the Adriatic, designed to protect the sea's karst habitats and biodiversity. The sea is abundant in flora and faunaâ€”more than 7,000 species are identified as native to the Adriatic, many of them endemic, rare and threatened ones.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service has 15 {{identified}} distinct population segments (DPS)s, in Washington, Oregon, and California.

5|$|The land {{beneath the}} Bay Area {{consists}} of layers {{of sand and}} clay to great depths.

5|$|Although Carmarthenshire is less frequented as {{a tourist}} {{destination}} than some other counties in Wales, it offers {{a wide range of}} outdoor activities. Much of the <b>coast</b> <b>is</b> fairly flat; it includes the Millennium Coastal Park, which extends for ten miles to the west of Llanelli; the National Wetlands Centre; a championship golf course; and the harbours of Burry Port and Pembrey. Further west are the sandy beaches at Llansteffan and Pendine, and Dylan Thomas' boathouse at Laugharne. Further inland {{there are a number of}} medieval castles, hillforts and standing stones.|$|E

5|$|Half-Life 2: Lost <b>Coast</b> <b>is</b> an {{additional}} {{level for the}} 2004 first-person shooter video game Half-Life 2. Developed by Valve Corporation, it was released on October 27, 2005, through the Steam content delivery service as a free download to owners of the Microsoft Windows version of Half-Life 2. Lost Coast serves as a technology demonstration, specifically showcasing the high-dynamic-range rendering implemented in the Source engine. The level was designed {{with a variety of}} appropriate environments to emphasize these effects. In addition, Lost Coast was the first video game developed by Valve to allow developers to explain various elements of design as the player progresses through the level.|$|E
5|$|Located in the Plymouth Pinelands, {{the town}} of Plymouth has many {{distinct}} geographical features. The town's Atlantic <b>coast</b> <b>is</b> characterized by low plains, while its western sections are extremely hilly and forested. Plymouth contains several small ponds scattered throughout its western quadrant, the largest being the Great Herring Pond (which is partly in {{the town of}} Bourne). A major feature of the town is the Myles Standish State Forest, which is in the southwestern region. Cachalot Scout Reservation, operated by the Cachalot District of the Narragansett Council of the Boy Scouts of America, lies adjacent to the state forest lands. There is also a smaller town forest, as well as several parks, recreation areas and beaches.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the most}} legendary music venues in Baltimore have been shut down, {{including}} most of the shops, churches, bars and other destinations on the legendary Pennsylvania Avenue, center for the city's jazz scene. The Royal Theater, {{once one of the}} premiere destinations for African American performers on the East <b>Coast,</b> <b>is</b> marked only by a simple plaque, the theater itself having been demolished in 1971. A statue of Billie Holiday remains on Pennsylvania Avenue, however, between Lafayette and Lanvale, with a plaque that reads I don't think I'm singing. I feel like I am playing a horn.

40|$|The {{resolution}} of environment problems suggests {{the study of}} tidal structures and mixing along the Mozambique <b>Coast.</b> Sofala Bank <b>is</b> the area with more available information for this study. Tides along the Mozambique <b>Coast</b> <b>are</b> semi-diurnal and tidal amplitudes vary over the year and in some location as Beira, achieve the amplitude of about 3. 6 meters. The analysis of water level amplitudes reveals that it varies depending of location along the Mozambique <b>Coast.</b> Beira <b>is</b> the shallowest part of Mozambique <b>Coast</b> and <b>is</b> where the highest water level amplitude and the maximum dominating tidal component (M 2) are found. The results indicate that tides along the Mozambican <b>coast</b> <b>are</b> standing waves. The application of the ROMS (Regional Ocean Model System) model results performs well the water level amplitudes. The study of currents shows the presence of stronger tidal current in Beira. The shallow areas along the <b>coast</b> <b>are</b> generally well mixed and around the shelf brake is developed stratification...|$|R

5|$|Staffa {{lies about}} 10kilometres (6mi) west of Mull, and 9km {{northeast}} of Iona. It is longitudinally oriented north-south, {{and is a}} kilometre long by about half a kilometre wide. The circumference is about 3.8km in extent. In the northeast the isle shelves to a shore, but otherwise the <b>coast</b> <b>is</b> rugged and much indented; numerous caves have been carved out by rain, streams and sea. There is enough grass to feed a few cattle, and the island has a spring.|$|E
5|$|The North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) {{is an area}} of European {{importance}} for wildlife in Norfolk, England.
