5|$|Where the two <b>chough</b> species occur together, {{there is}} only limited {{competition}} for food. An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed <b>chough</b> was almost exclusively Gagea bulbs, whilst the Alpine <b>chough</b> took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed on Lepidoptera larvae whereas Alpine choughs ate cranefly pupae. Later in the summer, the Alpine <b>chough</b> mainly consumed grasshoppers, whilst the red-billed <b>chough</b> added cranefly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. Both choughs will hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.|$|E
5|$|Both species lay 3–5 {{normally}} whitish eggs blotched {{with brown}} or grey, which are incubated by the female alone. The chicks hatch after {{two to three}} weeks. Red-billed <b>chough</b> chicks are almost naked, but the chicks of the higher altitude Alpine <b>chough</b> hatch with a dense covering of natal down. The chicks are fed by both parents and fledge in 29–31 days after hatching for Alpine <b>chough,</b> and 31–41days for red-billed.|$|E
5|$|In Spain, the red-billed <b>chough</b> has {{recently}} expanded its range by utilising old buildings, with 1,175 breeding pairs in a mi) study area. These new breeding areas usually surround the original montane core areas. However, the populations with nest sites on buildings {{are threatened by}} human disturbance, persecution {{and the loss of}} old buildings. Fossils of both <b>chough</b> species were found in the mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine <b>chough</b> and the reduced range of red-billed <b>chough</b> in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|E
40|$|Some {{bird species}} may breed close to {{aggressive}} predators to reduce predation risk by more dangerous, generalist predators. We tested this protective nesting association hypothesis by studying solitary <b>choughs,</b> Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax, breeding within or outside lesser kestrel, Falco naumanni, colonies in northern Spain (1993 - 1994). We found 27 potential predators of <b>choughs</b> and kestrels and confirmed predation, on adults and nests of both species {{by at least}} eight common predators. We experimentally assessed the defence investment of <b>choughs</b> and kestrels towards a stuffed eagle owl, Bubo bubo, in 19 buildings shared by both species. Lesser kestrels were more efficient at detecting the predator, and defended more vigorously than <b>choughs.</b> <b>Choughs</b> clearly selected for breeding buildings where lesser kestrel colonies were installed. Breeding success of these <b>choughs</b> was much higher man that of <b>choughs</b> breeding alone, because of a lower percentage of nest failure. Benefits to <b>choughs</b> probably accrued from both the 'parasitism' of the kestrels' nest defence and the dilution of predation risk in the colonies. Since lesser kestrels do not prey on <b>choughs,</b> {{this could be a}} good example of protective nesting association in birds. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

5|$|The <b>choughs</b> host bird fleas, {{including}} two Frontopsylla species which are Pyrrhocorax specialist. Other parasites recorded on <b>choughs</b> include a cestode Choanotaenia pirinica, and various species of chewing lice in the genera Brueelia, Menacanthus and Philopterus. Blood parasites such as Plasmodium {{have been found}} in red-billed <b>choughs,</b> but this is uncommon, and apparently does little harm. Parasitism levels are much lower than in some other passerine groups.|$|R
5|$|In {{the western}} Italian Alps, the Alpine <b>chough</b> nests {{in a greater}} variety of sites than red-billed <b>chough,</b> using natural cliffs, pot-holes and {{abandoned}} buildings, whereas the red-billed uses only natural cliffs (although it nests in old buildings elsewhere). The Alpine <b>chough</b> lays its eggs about one month later than its relative, although breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The Alpine <b>chough</b> is {{a host of}} the {{widespread}} bird flea Ceratophyllus vagabunda, two specialist <b>chough</b> fleas Frontopsylla frontalis and F.laetus, a cestode Choanotaenia pirinica, and various species of chewing lice in the genera Brueelia, Menacanthus and Philopterus.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed <b>chough</b> {{has a long}} {{association}} with Cornwall, and appears on the Cornish coat of arms. According to Cornish legend King Arthur did not die after his last battle but rather his soul migrated {{into the body of}} a red-billed <b>chough,</b> the red colour of its bill and legs being derived from the blood of the last battle and hence killing this bird was unlucky. Legend also holds that after the last Cornish <b>chough</b> departs from Cornwall, then the return of the <b>chough,</b> as happened in 2001, will mark the return of King Arthur.|$|E

5|$|The red-billed <b>chough</b> is {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other species of bird. Although the jackdaw and Alpine <b>chough</b> share its range, the jackdaw is smaller and has unglossed grey plumage, and the Alpine <b>chough</b> has a short yellow bill. Even in flight, the two choughs can be distinguished by Alpine's less rectangular wings, and longer, less square-ended tail.|$|E
5|$|The {{rippling}} preep and whistled sweeeooo {{calls of}} the Alpine <b>chough</b> {{are quite different}} from the more typically crow-like chee-ow vocalisations of the jackdaw and the red-billed <b>chough.</b> It also has a rolling churr alarm call, and a variety of quiet warbles and squeaks given by resting or feeding birds. In a study of <b>chough</b> calls throughout the Palearctic region it was found that call frequencies in the Alpine <b>chough</b> showed an inverse relationship between body size and frequency, being higher-pitched in smaller-bodied populations.|$|E
5|$|Where their ranges overlap, the two <b>chough</b> {{species may}} feed {{together}} in the summer, although there is only limited competition for food. An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed <b>chough</b> was almost exclusively Gagea bulbs dug from the ground, whilst the Alpine <b>chough</b> took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed mainly on caterpillars whereas Alpine choughs ate crane fly pupae. Later in the summer, the Alpine <b>chough</b> consumed large numbers of grasshoppers, while the red-billed <b>chough</b> added cranefly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. In the eastern Himalayas in November, Alpine choughs occur mainly in juniper forests where they feed on juniper berries, differing ecologically from the red-billed choughs in the same region {{and at the same}} time of year, which feed by digging in the soil of terraced pastures of villages.|$|E

5|$|Although {{these are}} mainly {{mountain}} species with limited interactions with humans, the red-billed <b>chough</b> has a coastal {{population in the}} far west of its range, and has cultural connections particularly with Cornwall, where it appears on the Cornish Coat of Arms. A legend from that county says that King Arthur did not die but {{was transformed into a}} red-billed <b>chough,</b> and hence killing this bird was unlucky.|$|E
5|$|Choughs can be locally {{threatened}} by the accumulation of pesticides and heavy metals in the mountain soils, heavy rain, shooting and other human disturbances, but a longer-term threat comes from global warming, which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely. Fossils of both <b>chough</b> species {{were found in the}} mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine <b>chough</b> and the reduced range of red-billed <b>chough</b> in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|E

5|$|The {{fossil record}} from the Pleistocene of Europe {{includes}} a form {{similar to the}} Alpine <b>chough,</b> and sometimes categorised as an extinct subspecies of that bird, and a prehistoric form of the red-billed <b>chough,</b> P. p. primigenius. There are eight generally recognised extant subspecies of red-billed <b>chough,</b> and two of Alpine, although all differ only slightly from the nominate forms. The greater subspecies diversity in the red-billed species arises from an early divergence of the Asian and geographically isolated Ethiopian races from the western forms.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is subject}} to {{predation}} and parasitism, the main threat to this species is changes in agricultural practices, which have led to population decline, some local extirpation, and range fragmentation in Europe; however, it is not threatened globally. The red-billed <b>chough,</b> which derived its common name from the jackdaw, was formerly associated with fire-raising, and has links with Saint Thomas Becket and Cornwall. The red-billed <b>chough</b> has been depicted on postage stamps of a few countries, including the Isle of Man, with four different stamps, and The Gambia, where the bird does not occur.|$|E
5|$|Both choughs {{occupied}} {{more extensive}} ranges in the past, reaching to more southerly and lower altitude areas than at present, with the Alpine <b>chough</b> breeding in Europe {{as far south}} as southern Italy, and both the decline and range fragmentation continue. Red-billed choughs have lost ground in most of Europe, and Alpine choughs have lost many breeding sites in the east of the continent. In the Canary Islands, the red-billed <b>chough</b> is now extinct on two of the islands on which it formerly bred, and the Alpine was lost from the archipelago altogether.|$|E
