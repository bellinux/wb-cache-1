50|$|Within public {{broadcasting}} {{there are two}} different views regarding commercial activity. One is that {{public broadcasting}} is incompatible with commercial objectives. The other is that public broadcasting can and should compete in the marketplace with <b>commercial</b> <b>broadcasters.</b> This dichotomy is highlighted by the public service aspects of traditional <b>commercial</b> <b>broadcasters.</b>|$|R

50|$|However, {{those who}} defend the BBC {{suggest that the}} BBC needs to provide new {{services}} and entertainment, to remain relevant in the digital age.Furthermore, there are also questions about the public service commitments of the <b>commercial</b> <b>broadcasters.</b> All <b>commercial</b> channels that broadcast solely on digital platforms do not have public service requirements imposed. After digital switchover many of these channels {{will have the same}} coverage as the analogue <b>commercial</b> <b>broadcasters.</b> This has raised the question of how the analogue <b>commercial</b> <b>broadcasters,</b> with their costly public service obligations, will compete on a level playing field with such digital channels.|$|R

50|$|In Australia, {{the major}} capital cities, and a {{majority}} of the regional areas, are served by three <b>commercial</b> <b>broadcasters.</b> However, some less populated areas are only granted two licences (and until the early 2000s, one in some cases) because there is not enough advertising revenue in some areas to keep three separate <b>commercial</b> <b>broadcasters</b> afloat.|$|R

2500|$|Regional {{television}} in Australia consists of independently owned networks 'affiliated' to metropolitan stations. WIN Television is the country's largest regional broadcaster {{in terms of}} population reach, followed by Southern Cross Ten, Prime Television, NBN Television, the Golden West Network, Southern Cross Television, and Imparja Television. Some regional centres have three <b>commercial</b> <b>broadcasters,</b> while others — such as regional Western Australia and remote central & eastern Australia — have two, and others — such as Mount Gambier and Broken Hill — have only one <b>commercial</b> <b>broadcaster.</b> In two broadcaster markets, the two incumbent <b>commercial</b> <b>broadcasters</b> applied for and were granted a third, digital-only license, while in single broadcaster markets, the incumbent <b>commercial</b> <b>broadcaster</b> was granted a second, and later a third license, to provide additional programming. [...] This {{has resulted in the}} establishment of a number of channels including Tasmanian Digital Television, Mildura Digital Television, and Darwin Digital Television.|$|R
50|$|If a <b>commercial</b> <b>broadcaster</b> {{wants to}} air a {{programme}} not rated by the FSK, the programme’s watershed is rated by the FSF (Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle Fernsehen - Voluntary Self Regulation for TV) instead. A programme with neither an FSK nor FSF rating {{is not usually}} aired by <b>commercial</b> <b>broadcasters,</b> as the KJM (Kommission für Jugendmedienschutz - Commission for the Protection of Minors in the Media) may charge a fine if it finds the content inappropriate. To avoid the original watershed for a programme or to air a blacklisted movie, <b>commercial</b> <b>broadcasters</b> can ask the FSF to tell them how to cut the movie for another rating.|$|R
