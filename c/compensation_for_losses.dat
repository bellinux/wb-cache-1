5|$|Cofresí's {{victims were}} locals and foreigners, {{and the region}} was {{economically}} destabilized. When he boarded Spanish vessels he usually targeted immigrants brought by the royal decree of 1815, ignoring his fellow criollos. The situation was complicated by several factors, most of them geopolitical. The Spanish Empire had lost most of its possessions in the New World, and her last two territories (Puerto Rico and Cuba) faced economic problems and political unrest. To undermine the commerce of former colonies, Spain stopped issuing letters of marque; this left sailors unemployed, and they gravitated towards Cofresí and piracy. On the diplomatic front, the pirates assaulted foreign ships while flying the Flag of Spain (angering nations who had reached an agreement about the return of ships captured by corsairs and <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>losses).</b> Aware that the problem had developed international overtones, Spanish-appointed governor of Puerto Rico Lt Gen Miguel Luciano de la Torre y Pando (1822–1837) made Cofresí's capture a priority. By December 1823 other nations joined the effort to combat Cofresí, sending warships to the Mona Passage. Gran Colombia sent two corvettes, the Bocayá and the Bolívar, {{under the command of}} former privateer and Jean Lafitte associate Renato Beluche. The British assigned a corvette, , to the region after the William Henry incident.|$|E

25|$|About 60,000 to 70,000 Loyalists {{left the}} newly founded republic; some {{migrated}} to Britain. The remainder, known as United Empire Loyalists, received land and subsidies for resettlement in British colonies in North America, especially Quebec (concentrating in the Eastern Townships), Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia. The new colonies of Upper Canada (now Ontario) and New Brunswick were expressly created by Britain for their benefit, where the Crown awarded land to Loyalists as <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> in the United States. Britain wanted {{to develop the}} frontier of Upper Canada on a British colonial model. But about 80% of the Loyalists stayed in the United States and became full, loyal citizens; some of the exiles later returned to the U.S.|$|E
25|$|As {{the knights}} (later, nobles - the szlachta class) started to acquire privileges, {{some of them}} began {{to change the way}} that the pospolite ruszenie functioned. The length of the service was set at two weeks. The Privilege of Buda of 1355 {{required}} the king to compensate any losses incurred by the nobles in wars abroad, and the Privilege of Koszyce of 1374 required him to pay the ransom for any nobles taken into captivity during wars abroad. A privilege of 1388 extended that <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> incurred when defending the country and confirmed that the nobles were to receive a monetary wage for their participation and that they should be consulted with by the king beforehand.|$|E
25|$|The {{duty of care}} owed by {{trustees}} and fiduciaries has its partner in the common law of negligence, and was also long recognised by courts of equity. Millett LJ, however, in Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew emphasised that although recognised in equity, and applicable to fiduciaries, the duty of care is not itself a fiduciary duty, like the rule against conflicts of interest. This means that like ordinary negligence actions, the common law requirements for proving causation of loss apply, and the remedy for breach of duty is of <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> rather than restitution of gains. In Mothew this meant that a solicitor (who occupies a fiduciary position, like a trustee) who negligently told a building society that its client had no second mortgage was not liable for the loss in the property's value after the client defaulted. Mr Mothew successfully argued that Bristol & West would have granted the loan in any case, and so his advice did not cause their loss.|$|E

25|$|On June 16, 2009, Judge Burton Lifland {{approved}} the settlement between Picard and Banco Santander SA's Optimal Investment Services. The Optimal SUS fund, one of Madoff's largest feeder funds, {{agreed to pay}} $235 million, about 85% of the $285 million that the Geneva-based hedge fund group redeemed in the 90 days before Madoff was arrested. As of December 2008, Santander had $3.2 billion of clients' money invested with Madoff, a relationship that started in 1996. The fund continues to have claims against Madoff's estate. The largest Spanish bank earned nearly $100 million in management fees in 2006 and 2007 combined selling the feeder fund. Santander lost €17 million ($23.8 million) of its own money. 70% of its affected clients are in Latin America. In April, Santander offered its clients <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> from the fraud, and 93% of clients affected by the Madoff fraud had accepted, which it originally valued at €1.38 billion. The offer has been widely criticized.|$|E
500|$|Cornwallis also {{negotiated}} with the parliament {{the passage of a}} bill offering amnesty to most of the rebels. [...] This idea was vigorously opposed both in the Protestant-controlled Irish Parliament and in London. [...] By the time the bill passed and received the royal signature in October, it contained numerous exceptions, meaning that anyone with a role of significance in the rebellion was likely not eligible. The bill was also enacted too late to be of significant benefit anyway. He offered financial <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> incurred by loyalists, the terms of which were significantly abused, as claims were often made well in excess of actual losses. This policy of lenience was furthermore disliked by politically influential Protestants, which complicated some of Cornwallis's later activities.|$|E
500|$|While {{this was}} going on, the United States was {{negotiating}} with Great Britain over <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> inflicted by British ships knowingly sold to the Confederacy during the Civil War (the Alabama Claims). Peru {{had been involved in}} an undeclared war with Spain (the Chincha Islands War) in 1864–66 and the US was not willing to prejudice its claims against the United Kingdom by performing a similar action for a belligerent power. Negotiations over the issue delayed the departure of the two monitors until January 1869, after Peru bought two steamers, Reyes and Marañon to tow the monitors. They only reached Pensacola, Florida, before machinery breakdowns forced them to wait 30 days for repairs to be completed. En route from Key West to the Bahamas, the ships were separated in heavy weather. Atahualpa reached Great Inagua in the Bahamas and was able to resupply, although her officers had to pay for themselves. The ships finally reunited at St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands and had to wait for the Pachitea to arrive from Peru to tow Manco Cápac, as the monitor had accidentally rammed and sunk Reyes during the storm. While entering Rio de Janeiro on the night of 15 September, Manco Cápac ran aground; she was refloated the following day, but the damage required three months to repair. The ships were joined by the steam corvette [...] during this time. They reached the Strait of Magellan on 29 January 1870 and Callao on 11 May.|$|E

They only reached Pensacola, Florida, before machinery breakdowns forced them to wait 30 days for repairs to be completed. En route from Key West to the Bahamas, the ships were separated in heavy weather. When Reyes attempted to reattach her towrope after the storm moderated, she collided with the sharp bow of Manco Cápac and sank in 15 minutes. The monitor, short of coal and food, was forced to make port at Naranjo, Cuba, then held by rebels against the Spanish government. They allowed the ship to restock her supplies, but no coal was available so the crew loaded up enough wood to reach the Bahamas where they were able to send a local schooner to Nassau to inform the authorities of their plight. The ships finally reunited at St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands and had to wait for the Pachitea to arrive from Peru to tow Manco Cápac.

During the events in Diyarbakır, forensic examinations of detained were carried out in places of detention. According to the Report of the Commission, [...] "this contravenes the rules and the circulars issued by the Ministries of Justice and Health as well as the independence of the medical profession". The Commission also believes that [...] "the new provisions introduced in June 2006 to amend the anti-terror law could undermine the fight against torture and ill-treatment". The Commission also stresses that [...] "a return to normality in Southeast can only be achieved be opening dialogue with local counterparts". [...] "A comprehensive strategy should be pursued to achieve the socio-economic development of the region and the establishment of conditions for the Kurdish population to enjoy full rights and freedoms.
