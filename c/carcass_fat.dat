50|$|The {{family of}} β-agonists {{includes}} β1-, β2-, and β3-agonists such as clenbuterol, ractopamine, cimaterol, zilpaterol and salbutamol. They possess similar chemical structures with different substituent {{groups on the}} phenyl ethanolamines. Due to their significant nutrition redistribution function, β-agonists have been applied in the livestock industry such as pigs and ruminants to reduce <b>carcass</b> <b>fat</b> and increase muscle mass while improving growth rate and feed conversion (Bareille and Faverdin, 1996, Bergen et al., 1989, Byrem et al., 1998, Cardoso and Taveira, 2002, Shook et al., 2009 and Williams et al., 1987). Unfortunately, β-agonists deposited in animal tissues can cause acute poisoning when consumed by humans, particularly in people with symptoms of muscular tremors, cardiac palpitation, nervousness, headache, muscular pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills (Brambilla et al., 2000). Therefore, the use of β-agonists in animal feeds has been banned in many countries such as the EU and China (Mitchell and Dunnavan, 1998 and Prezelj et al., 2003). There are still illicit usages of β-agonists in animal feeds in many countries.|$|E

40|$|NoRATIONALE: The carbon isotopic {{characterisation}} of ruminant lipids {{associated with}} ceramic vessels has been crucial for elucidating {{the origins and}} changing nature of pastoral economies. delta(13) C values of fatty acids extracted from potsherds are commonly compared with those from the dairy and <b>carcass</b> <b>fats</b> of modern domesticated animals to determine vessel use. However, the processing of wild ruminant products in pottery, such as deer, is rarely considered {{despite the presence of}} several different species on many prehistoric sites. To address this issue, the carbon isotope range of fatty acids from a number of red deer (Cervus elaphus) tissues, a species commonly encountered in the European archaeological record, was investigated. METHODS: Lipids were extracted from 10 modern red deer tissues obtained from the Slowinski National Park (Poland). Fatty acids were fractionated, methylated and analysed by gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GCCIRMS). The delta(13) C values of n-octadecanoic acid and n-hexadecanoic acid, and the difference between these values (Delta(13) C), were compared with those from previously published ruminant fats. RESULTS: Nine of the ten deer <b>carcass</b> <b>fats</b> measured have Delta(13) C values of less than - 3. 3 per thousand, the threshold previously used for classifying dairy products. Despite considerable overlap, dairy fats from domesticated ruminants with Delta(13) C values less than - 4. 3 per thousand are still distinguishable. CONCLUSIONS: The finding has implications for evaluating pottery use and early pastoralism. The processing of deer tissues and our revised criteria should be considered, especially where there is other archaeological evidence for their consumption...|$|R

Bulls, heifers and steers were slaughtered at 15, 20 and 24 months of age, respectively. The diet offered before slaughter includes grass silage only, grass or maize silage plus supplementary concentrates, or concentrates offered ad libitum plus 1 kg of roughage dry matter per head daily. Following the slaughter, carcasses were classified mechanically for conformation and fatness (scale 1 to 15), and {{the right side of}} each carcass was dissected into meat, <b>fat</b> and bone. <b>Carcass</b> conformation score ranged from 4. 7 to 14. 4, 5. 4 to 10. 9 and 2. 0 to 12. 0 for bulls, heifers and steers, respectively; the corresponding ranges for fat score were 2. 7 to 11. 5, 3. 2 to 11. 3 and 2. 8 to 13. 3. Prediction equations for <b>carcass</b> meat, <b>fat</b> and bone proportions were developed using multiple regression, with <b>carcass</b> conformation and <b>fat</b> score both included as continuous independent variables. In a separate series of analyses, the independent variable in the model was the proportion of the trait under investigation (meat, fat or bone) in the hindquarter.

The iodine value (IV) of pork fat is commonly used as an indicator of quality. To identify the factors associated with <b>carcass</b> <b>fat</b> IV, meta-analyses were conducted to describe the relevant variables and to develop prediction equations to assist swine nutritionists and producers in producing pork fat with an acceptable IV. Data from 21 experiments were used to develop prediction equations for <b>carcass</b> <b>fat</b> IV of pigs fed a relatively constant dietary iodine value product (IVP) throughout the feeding period, and 6 experiments were used to develop prediction equations for <b>carcass</b> <b>fat</b> IV of pigs fed a dietary IVP-reduction strategy before marketing. Backfat, belly fat, and jowl fat IV were all highly correlated among the experiments that measured the IV of the multiple fat depots (r ≥ 0. 880; P < 0. 001). As expected, the dietary concentrations of unsaturated (primarily polyunsaturated) fatty acids were the most important in predicting <b>carcass</b> <b>fat</b> IV. However, improved prediction models were achieved by including variables to describe the pigs’ initial and final BW, ADG, and carcass leanness. Increased ADG, final BW, BW range over course of the diet, and backfat depth resulted in reduced backfat IV (P < 0. 02). Belly fat IV was also reduced with increasing final BW, BW range over course of the diet, and backfat depth (P < 0. 03). A reduced jowl fat IV was associated with an increase in backfat depth and a lower fat-free lean index (FFLI, P < 0. 02). Data analyzed to develop equations for predicting <b>carcass</b> <b>fat</b> IV using a dietary IVP-reduction strategy indicated that the concentrations of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids in the initial diet were the most important. The concentrations of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids in the reduced- IVP diet fed before marketing were also important in predicting the IV of <b>carcass</b> <b>fat.</b> However, the IV of backfat was the most amenable to change using an IVP-reduction strategy. Feeding the pigs for a longer period and to a heavier final BW resulted in a reduced backfat IV (P ≤ 0. 05).

Complete Random Design (RAL) consist of 4 treatments and 5 repeating was applied.   Each treatment unit consisted of 4 tails of male Alabio duck.   Set as treatment was levels of Azzola pinnata flour usage as much as 0 (A 0); 7. 5 (A 2); 15 (A 3); and 22. 5 % (A 4).   The effect of treatment towards abdomen fat (A 0, A 1, A 2, and A 3 / 1. 50; 1. 41; 1. 23; 0. 92 %), <b>carcass</b> <b>fat</b> (A 0, A 1, A 2, and A 3 / 7. 99; 7. 53; 5. 74; 5. 25 %), and skin color (A 0, A 1, A 2, and A 3 / 2. 66; 3. 62; 3. 94; 4. 20).   this research showed result of that treatment influence was significantly difference (P < 0. 05).    Conclusion of this research, that azolla usage within dietary is able to decrease abdomen fat degree and <b>carcass</b> <b>fat,</b> reform skin color, thus, produce yellow color or un-pale.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the effect of <b>carcass</b> <b>fat</b> on egg production in broiler breeder hens. Two groups of birds were brought into production {{at the same time}} (after a similar period of delay) but with widely different levels of <b>carcass</b> <b>fat.</b> This was accomplished by subjecting one group to restricted dietary energy and increasing daylength and the other to full feed but declining daylength. After reaching peak production the birds were subjected to a 0, 10 or 20 % reduction in energy intake for the remainder of a 36 week production period. Carcass samples taken at sexual maturity, at peak production and after 24 and 36 weeks of lay indicated that the level of <b>carcass</b> <b>fat</b> did not affect egg production adversely. A 20 % reduction in energy intake reduced production of total and settable eggs significantly during the cold winter months but had no effect on production during the summer months. There was a slight but non-significant improvement in egg production and feed efficiency when energy was restricted by 10 % in the summer. Egg size was not affected significantly by energy restriction in either experiment. Under the conditions of these experiments <b>carcass</b> <b>fat</b> had no significant effect on egg production. Egg production and <b>carcass</b> <b>fat</b> were roughly related to energy intake depending upon the season of the year. POULTRY SCIENCE 54 : 200 - 208, 1975 MOST attempts to restrict the feed or energy intake of laying strain hens while in production have resulted in lower egg production and egg weights (Burmester and Card, 1939; Heywang, 1940). It was tempting to explain the results of these early experi-ments by citing the use of high-fiber, low-en-ergy diets which made it difficult for the hens to overconsume energy. More recent studies in which modern laying diets were employed have yielded results similar to the earlier work. Walter and Aitken (1961) reported a reduction in egg production with White Leg-horns when feed was restricted to 80 % of ad libitum controls. McGinnis and Dronawat (1967) found that restricitng feed intake to 90 % of ad libitum controls reduced egg pro-duction and egg weights in most experiments. Similar results were reported by Polin an...|$|E
