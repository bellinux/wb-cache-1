In the Battle of Maxen, he did not arrive in time to support Friedrich August von Finck. On 20 August 1760, {{he was able to}} defend himself against a hostile uprising with 12,000 men in the Battle of Strehla, whereupon the King gave him 1500 thalers, and wrote: [...] "I <b>congratulate</b> <b>you</b> [...] Officers of your subordinate Corps [...] My most gracious Compliments." ...|$|E
500|$|The minor-key [...] "La Vida es Así" [...] (Life Is Like That) {{features}} vocal {{effects and}} synthesizers. The urban version [...] "attacks" [...] with a modern and aggressive beat; the bachata version is slower, with Luny Tunes' tropical rhythms. In the lyrics, Ivy Queen declares to a rival: [...] "The guy you're dating is mine, {{and you know}} it, but here's the detail: He's worthless in bed. That's why I'm here to <b>congratulate</b> <b>you</b> for setting me free, I have to confess". The reggaeton rhymes tell a story of revenge and lovesickness. Angie Romero of Latina Magazine describes the song as a [...] "powerful and pulsating break-up anthem." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 1, 2014, it was {{reported}} by Axel Telzerow, editor-in-chief of the German technology magazine Computer Bild, that following the posting of a video where a presenter was able to bend an iPhone 6 Plus, an Apple Germany representative informed the publication {{that it had been}} banned from future Apple events and that it would no longer receive devices directly from Apple for testing. Telzerow responded by saying that [...] "we <b>congratulate</b> <b>you</b> to your fine new generation of iPhones, even if one of them has a minor weakness with its casing.

500|$|Post editor Hibbs {{said that}} the Four Freedoms were an [...] "inspiration... {{in the same way}} that the clock tower of old Independence Hall, which I can see from my office window, inspires me." [...] Roosevelt wrote to Rockwell [...] "I think you have done a superb job in {{bringing}} home to the plain, everyday citizen the plain, everyday truths behind the Four Freedoms... I <b>congratulate</b> <b>you</b> not alone on the execution but also for the spirit which impelled you to make this contribution to the common cause of a freer, happier world". Roosevelt wrote to The Post, [...] "This is the first pictorial representation I have seen of the staunchly American values contained in the rights of free speech and free worship and our goals of freedom from fear and want." [...] Roosevelt also wrote of the corresponding essays, [...] "Their words should inspire all who read them with a deeper appreciation of the way of life we are striving to preserve." ...|$|E
500|$|Leno {{began to}} drink heavily after performances, and, by 1901, {{like his father}} and {{stepfather}} before him, he had become an alcoholic. He gradually declined physically and mentally and displayed frequent bouts of erratic behaviour that began to affect his work. By 1902, Leno's angry and violent behaviour directed at fellow cast members, friends and family had become frequent. Once composed, he would become remorseful and apologetic. His erratic behaviour was often {{a result of his}} diminishing ability to remember his lines and inaudibility in performance. Leno also suffered increasing deafness, which eventually caused problems on and off stage. In 1901, during a production of Bluebeard, Leno missed his verbal cue and, as a result, was left stuck up a tower for more than twenty minutes. At the end of the run of Mother Goose in 1903, producer Arthur Collins gave a tribute to Leno and presented him, on behalf of the Drury Lane Theatre's management, with an expensive silver dinner service. Leno rose to his feet and said: [...] "Governor, it's a magnificent present! I <b>congratulate</b> <b>you</b> and you deserve it!" ...|$|E
500|$|Coolidge himself later said, [...] "No {{doubt it}} was the police strike in Boston that brought me into {{national}} prominence." [...] In a post-election congratulatory telegram President Wilson wrote: [...] "I <b>congratulate</b> <b>you</b> upon your election as a victory for law and order. When that is the issue, all Americans must stand together." [...] His role in the strike, however limited, became a prominent feature of his resume as he sought higher office. According to one obituary, [...] "the Boston police strike of 1919 ... brought him national prominence and the nomination for the Vice Presidency" [...] in 1920. When he succeeded to the presidency in 1923 upon the death of Warren Harding, the New York Times headlined its biography: [...] "Coolidge Firmness Won Recognition; His Suppression of the Boston Police Strike Made Him a National Figure". Coolidge's political rivals interpreted his role differently. In 1925, U.S. Senator Robert La Follette of Wisconsin said that Coolidge's failure to intervene in that year's coal strike mirrored his 1919 actions when he [...] "persistently refused to act upon the requests of the Mayor of Boston for assistance until riot and bloodshed had aroused the entire State. Then when order had been restored by the efforts of Mayor Peters and the Storrow committee Coolidge sent in the militia and claimed full credit for restoring 'law and order'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later in 1822, a 30-year-old Rossini {{succeeded in}} meeting Ludwig van Beethoven, {{who was then}} aged 51, deaf, cantankerous and in failing health.
