40|$|Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole and Norway lobster are 7 main {{target species}} of the {{demersal}} mixed fisheries in the North Sea, Skagerrak and Eastern Channel. Gadoids and Norway lobsters are mainly taken in the nor-thern North Sea by towed gears except beam trawls while the flatfish fisheries are conducted in the southern North Sea mainly using beam trawls. Recently, the central North Sea appears less fished by demersal gears. Towed nets including seines and beam trawls equipped with meshes of more than 100 mm resp. more than 80 mm were identified as the main gears effecting the depleted cod and reduced plaice stocks. The saithe sector, using towed nets with meshes of more than 110 mm, longlines, gill nets and others, appears to affect the 7 species to a lesser extend. These results support the interim effort limitations by gear types, vessel and month as enforced by the European Commission since 2003. TAC regulations alone are considered inefficient to sustainably harvest stocks by mixed fisheries. A fleet-effort management method is developed estimating the fleets’ effects based on the sum of partial exploitation rates of the species in mixed fisheries weighted by {{the ratio of the}} precautionary reference Bpa and the actual SSB size as ecological quality objective. Applying such fleet effort management could result in increased <b>catch</b> <b>possibilities</b> of some stocks by fleets selecting mainly few and non-overexploited stocks while respecting precautionary management constraints in minimum SSB or maximum exploitation rates at the same time...|$|R
40|$|The {{recovery}} of fish stocks is in principle an investment decision weighing up short term losses against future gains. In the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) of the EU long term management or recovery plans are a main instrument. One {{of the basic}} aims is to move from a short term to a longer term perspective in the management process by having automatic rules about how to set quotas in the following years. This gives fishermen more security on <b>catch</b> <b>possibilities</b> in the future. However, {{it is not clear}} whether measures in recovery plans are economically feasible or not. Fishermen may lose more than they gain from such a recovery plan. In the first part of the paper we describe the economics behind long term management plans and the rationale of such plans from an economic viewpoint. Secondly, we use the Baltic cod fishery as an example to compare the present value of recovery scenarios and a status quo scenario. As a simplification only one cod stock is assumed in that calculation (in the Baltic Sea a western and eastern stock are distinguished). In the meantime a long term management plan for Baltic cod is in place since 2008. Especially the Eastern stock shows strong signs of recovery because of reduced fishing effort and good recruitment. In a third part we analyze to which extent the general calculations are comparable to the experiences in the real fishery...|$|R

40|$|EXTRACT (SEE PDF FOR FULL ABSTRACT) : Catch of {{coho salmon}} {{off the coast}} of Washington and Oregon since 1925 appears to be related to {{large-scale}} events in the atmosphere, which in turn affect ocean currents and coastal upwelling intensities in the northeastern Pacific. At least two time scales of variations can be identified. The first is that of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation phenomenon giving rise to an irregular cycle of between 3 to 7 years. [...] . The second time scale of variation seems to have a periodicity of about 20 years, although this is based on a limited dataset. [...] . This paper endeavors to describe how, if real, these atmospheric/oceanic effects are integrated and might affect the salmon <b>catch.</b> The <b>possibility</b> must also be considered that the atmospheric events are symbiotically related to the oceanic events and, further, that both may be enmeshed in even longer-term variability of climate...|$|R
40|$|Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole and Norway lobster are the 7 main {{target species}} of the mixed {{demersal}} fisheries of the North Sea, Skagerrak and Eastern Channel. Among these, cod and plaice stocks are at low levels (historically), there is risk of poor recruitment and the current levels imply ongoing and significant losses in long-term yields. The 7 main resources are exploited {{by a variety of}} competing fleets deploying often quite unselective gears. The poorly defined fishing strategies result in high discards or unallocated landings far in excess of the single species TACs and thus jeopardizing multi-annual recovery and management plans. In this paper we propose a fleet specific effort management system. The fleet specific effects we estimate are based on the sum of partial exploitation rates of the species caught. They are then weighted by the ratio of the actual SSB size and the precautionary biomass reference (Bpa) which is also the ‘ecological quality objective’. As an axiom, fishing activities are thus considered more beneficial with decreasing numbers of species represented in the catch. The developed relative effort factors were applied in medium term simulations of the annual management decision processes on future <b>catch</b> <b>possibilities,</b> in accordance with the existing or proposed multi-annual management plans (including the cod recovery). Uncertainties in the international catch data compiled and the stock assessments significantly undermine the results and their application for management purposes. Towed nets, including seines equipped with 70 - 99 mm or ≥ 100 mm mesh size, beam trawlers ≥ 80 mm and gill nets are identified as the main gears affecting the depleted cod and plaice stocks. In contrast, trawls of 16 - 31 mm, longlines and other gear types appear to less significantly affect the stocks we considered. The proposed fleet management would require stringent effort reductions for the cod and plaice sensitive fleets over a time period of about 5 years, i. e. towed nets of ≥ 100 mm mesh size, beam trawlers ≥ 80 mm, trawls of 70 - 99 mm and gill nets. This will reduce the exploitation rates of all stocks significantly and, after their recoveries, catches will continuously exceed recent levels by far and management interventions would be minor. The more selective longlines and other fleet types will profit from increased effort and catch allowances over the entire scenario periods. The recovery and management plans on cod are dominating the management decisions resulting in significant under-exploitation of each haddock, saithe and plaice stocks due to poor fishing strategies with high by-catches. Even a low degree of non-compliance with the effort and adapted catch allowances as simulated through parameter bias indicates significant delays in realizing the predefined management goals. JRC.

40|$|Sharks {{caught in}} {{tropical}} Australian waters occasionally exhibit tough texture. Two species of Carcharinid shark, originally {{known as the}} sorrah shark (Carcharinus sorrah) and the black spot shark (Carcharinus tilstoni), compose {{the majority of the}} catch. Experiments were conducted to identify the cause of tough texture and to improve the overall quality of the <b>catch.</b> The <b>possibility</b> that a cold shock reaction may occur was investigated by observing the contraction of fillets under a range of temperature conditions before freezing. The effect of on-board handling practices were evaluated using frozen shark fillets, which had been stored prior to freezing in refrigerated seawater at different rigor stages, temperatures and times as trunks. Fillets were analyzed for nucleotides, lactate, thaw pH, sarcomere length and raw and cooked shear force values. The existence of thaw rigor was also investigated. There was little difference in the texture between the individual strips of a fillet exposed to different temperatures but there were significant differences between individual sharks. A cold shock reaction could not be demonstrated in these species. The main influences on texture were of biological origin. The species, sex and size were found to have significant links with texture of fillets. The quality of the fillets deteriorated quicker during the warmer season and were at their worst if the trunks were kept on deck till post-rigor or held in 15 degree C refrigerated seawater before freezin...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cocaine, {{particularly}} in its base form (’crack’), {{has become one}} of the drugs of most concern in the Netherlands, being associated with a wide range of medical, psychiatric and social problems for the individual, and with significant public order consequences for society. Available treatment options for cocaine dependent users are limited, and a substantial part of the cocaine dependent population is not reached by the addiction treatment system. Psychosocial interventions for cocaine dependence generally show modest results, and there are no registered pharmacological treatments to date, despite the wide range of medications tested for this type of dependence. The present study (Cocaine Addiction Treatments to improve Control and reduce Harm; <b>CATCH)</b> investigates the <b>possibilities</b> and problems associated with new pharmacological treatments for crack dependent patients.

40|$|During {{the period}} 1898 - 1906 red romans Chrysoblephus laticeps {{dominated}} redfish landings at Strand and Hermanus, Republic of South Africa, ports subject to cool upwelling conditions. Red stumpnoses C. gibbiceps {{were the main}} species along the eastern Cape Peninsula and seventy-fours Polysteganus undulosus at most harbours east of Cape Agulhas. By the late 1970 's romans were dominant between Kalk Bay and Arniston and also important contributors else-where, but seventy-fours were only recorded in any significant quantities from Port Alfred. Interpretation of these trends is complicated by a lumping of <b>catches,</b> but the <b>possibility</b> of an environmental change favouring romans (cooler water) {{at the expense of}} seventy-fours (warmer water) cannot be discounted. Other marine forms having a biology associated with cooler waters have also increased along the southern Cape coast in recent years. Redfish resources at Gans Bay and Struts Bay are not currently overexploited, but provide a valuable source of remuneration for local fishermen when preferred target species are absent. Limited data collected in the Tsitsikamma Coastal National Park indicate that dageraad C. cristiceps populations could deteriorate rapidly if subjected to high fishing pressure.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the 1970 s placed potentially vast areas under national jurisdiction. From relatively modest territorial seas close to the coast as the only basis of fisheries jurisdiction for States, suddenly the international community embraced {{a new form of}} jurisdiction over resources that extended to fisheries up to 200 nautical miles from land. This extension brought over one third of the world’s oceans under national jurisdiction, or more importantly, approximately ninety percent of the world’s wild fish <b>catch.</b> While the <b>possibility</b> of bringing the resources of these areas under national control was of tremendous value to many developing States, the difficulties of enforcement over such areas were not so readily considered. Some States, notably the States of the South Pacific, but by no means restricted to them, simply lacked the capacity to police their waters and protect their resources from the depredation of others. A vast area subject to national jurisdiction would potentially require substantial assets at sea and in the air in order to effectively patrol, police, and enforce the new jurisdiction vested in States. For oil and gas exploitation, deployment of few if any coast guard or naval assets in the EEZ was not a huge difficulty, as exploitation of the seabed is a slow and expensive business. For fisheries, which can be far more cheaply exploited, and in a more transitory fashion, a lack of enforcement capacity represented a potentially serious impediment...|$|R
40|$|Distribution, length {{frequency}} structure, sex-ratio, {{maturity and}} dorsal mantle length–total weight relationship for Illex coindetii (Verany, 1839) were described {{for the first}} time in the South-Western Adriatic Sea (Central Mediterranean). Samples came from six experimental bottom trawl surveys carried out within the framework of the Medits programme from 1997 to 2002. Although specimens have been collected at a wide depth range, I. coindetii concentrates between 50 and 200 m. The population had a smaller squid size and length at first maturity with respect to other Mediterranean and Atlantic regions, probably due to the interaction of some environmental factors (sea temperature and fishing pressure) and the biological characteristics of the species. There was no difference in males/females ratio by year, but there was a general dominance of females over males at larger sizes and of males over females at smaller sizes. The different proportion of juveniles and mature individuals in the <b>catch</b> suggested the <b>possibility</b> of a prolonged spawning season with a spring spawning peak. There was a pronounced sexual dimorphism, females mature at larger mantle length attaining larger size in respect of males.

40|$|ABSTRACT Artificial exploitations {{transfer}} {{to land on}} slope gradually due to the population grows up and economical requirement. It changed the land use, and broke the structure of soil. As rain fell, disasters were often occurred everywhere in Taiwan. The propose of the research is to <b>catch</b> on the <b>possibility</b> and degree of soil erosion, thus we may ensure the security of people in Taiwan. According to the Soil Erosion Index Model(SEIM), we gathered the data of rain, topography, soil property, cover and land use, and then drew {{the plot of the}} soil erosion potential by Surfer 6. 0 and ArcView software. We find that artificial exploitation is the main reason that influences the soil erosion situation in northern part of Taiwan. Relatively, both of natural condition and artificial exploitation make the soil erosion serious in southern part of Taiwan. Compare with reference data, we can see that we value the soil erosion at a little low rate, especially in certain cases. However, we didn't estimate the collapse in SEIM, that may be the reason why we got such result. 摘 要 由於人口成長與經濟需求，人類開發活動由平地逐漸轉移至山地，改變了坡地原有土地利用情況，土壤層亦因而鬆動，隨著各地的降雨，近年來全島各地山崩、土石流等土砂災害頻傳。為瞭解各地發生土壤沖蝕之嚴重程度與危險性，以提供土壤資源永續發展之參考，進而保障人民的安全，本研究以土壤沖蝕指標模式（SEIM）為理論基礎，配合各地降雨、地形、土壤、覆蓋及土地利用等相關資料，運用Surfer 6. 0 與ArcView GIS軟體建立台灣地區土壤沖蝕潛勢圖，分析全島各地之土壤沖蝕潛勢。經分析後發現，影響北部地區土壤沖蝕的因素多為人為開發，改變覆蓋與土地利用型態所致；南部則是天然條件不佳，再加上人為開發，使土壤沖蝕更為嚴重。 將分析結果與 1991 年由水資源統一規劃委員會（以下簡稱水資會）公布的主要河川年輸砂量相比較，發現本研究估算之土壤沖蝕量，考慮崩塌量的影響，山區雨量的低估，以及使用平均坡度的均化問題，略低於輸砂量，其中以濁水溪、八掌溪、秀姑巒溪等主要河川，低估情形較明顯，其原因除了本研究所採用模式或水資會所公布的輸砂量之正確性外，SEIM中僅考慮崩塌地的沖蝕潛勢，卻無實際計算崩塌量，河砂開採等人類活動所造成的影響，亦無計算進去，因此造成估算結果上的差異。目錄 摘 要 I ABSTRACT II 目錄 III 表目錄 V 圖目錄 VI 第一章 前 言 1 第二章 前人研究 2 2. 1 通用土壤流失公式（USLE）的發展 2 2. 2 農業非點源污染模式（AGNPS） 3 2. 3 國內相關研究 4 第三章 理論架構 7 3. 1 土壤沖蝕指標模式 7 3. 2 使用軟體簡介 14 3. 2. 1 ArcView地理資訊系統簡介 14 3. 2. 2 Surfer 6. 0 簡介 15 3. 3 研究流程 15 第四章 分析結果 18 4. 1 土壤沖蝕量之估算 18 4. 2 台灣地區土壤沖蝕潛勢查詢系統 28 4. 3 河川土壤沖蝕潛勢之分析 34 4. 3. 1 後龍溪流域 35 4. 3. 2 烏溪流域 37 4. 3. 3 濁水溪流域 39 4. 3. 4 八掌溪流域 40 4. 3. 5 蘭陽溪流域 42 4. 3. 6 花蓮溪流域 43 4. 3. 7 秀姑巒溪流域 44 4. 3. 8 卑南溪流域 46 4. 3. 9 二仁溪流域 48 4. 3. 10 高屏溪流域 49 第五章 結論與建議 52 第六章 參考文獻 5...|$|R
