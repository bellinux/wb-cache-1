40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a system for}} object detection on a <b>conveying</b> <b>belt.</b> The detection algorithms {{are based on the}} permanence effect that basically consists on increasing a state variable associated to each pixel of the sensor when the moving element is located on that particular pixel point, and to decrease it otherwise. Using this permanence effect, a characteristic called LSR can be obtained (relationship between length and speed). This characteristic generally defines the moving element uniquely, making it possible to detect it on the <b>conveying</b> <b>belt.</b> The permanence effect as well as the LSR characteristic biologically inspired mechanisms and very close to the accumulation mechanisms in the synapses of the biological neurons. The described system has learning capacity, being able to modify the group of elements to be detected without necessity of modifying the system’s algorithms. This system has been tested in the laboratory using a series of medicines, obtaining very satisfactory results. To show the versatility of the used mechanisms another application of the same system is included, in this case the recognition of faces. 1.

5000|$|The short {{begins in}} the Painted Desert as a Jimmy Durante sound alike vulture {{complains}} to his friend Joe about his hunger that his stomach literally starts to talk back to him. Joe opens his mouth {{where there is a}} spider web with a sign that reads Closed for the duration [...] The Durante Vulture expresses his desire for a T-bone steak. A picture of a steak is shown on the screen for a couple seconds followed by a sign the reads 3 minute intermission for drooling.They later spot a jackrabbit and fight over him. They get caught up in their fight and the rabbit gets away. The vultures then start to plot against each other and try eating other. The Durante vulture sits next to a rock and Joe sneakily makes a sandwich with his hand. When the Durante vulture questions Joe's actions he lies and explains he has a toothache. He asks him to examine his tooth while and tries to bite his head. Joe begins to salt the Durante vulture's tail before he hits him on the head with a mallet. The Durante Vulture starts to read a book on cooking and is unknowningly being cooked in a pot by Joe. The Durante Vulture soon realizes this and runs into a log cabin. Joe tricks him into coming outside by pretending to see a beautiful woman. The Durante Vulture comes out and Joe hits him on the head and then covers him and mustard before Joe gets up and runs. The two vultures chase after each other until The Durante Vulture pretends to be a rattlesnake which causes Joe to faint. But right after Joe faints he sees a real one and faints himself. The Durante Vulture later paints a rock to look like a steak and calls Joe over to eat it. Joe eats perfectly and {{as if it were a}} real steak. The Durante Vulture tries to do the same only to break his teeth. The vultures get in a scuffle that turns into a whirlwind. Joe escapes and pulls a pot under Durante Vulture only to notice that he has disappeared. The Durante Vulture is revealed to have put a pot under Joe and closes it and puts in an oven. The Durante Vulture sits on top of the stove which is revealed to be a <b>conveyer</b> <b>belt</b> to a meat slicer. The Durante Vulture runs into a hole and Joe uses a pickaxe to get to him. The Durante Vulture pops up from the hole behind him and proceeds to chop the cactus. The Durante Vulture grows tired and surrenders. He goes over to have himself beheaded and Joe almost does but the Durante Vulture runs after Joe with the butcher knife. The vultures chase each other with various weapons around a rock until the Durante Vulture notices that the rabbit has returned. They capture the rabbit and fight over him only for the rabbit to reveal that it's Meatless Tuesday causing the vultures to cry. As a final gag, an announcer says due to popular demand from the audience the steak from earlier was shown again.|$|E

An own developed testing equipment based on gravimetric determination of mass loss of rubber test specimen was used investigating dynamic wear with respect to fracture properties of top cover materials. Furthermore we investigated fatigue crack growth (FCG) data over a broad range of tearing energy by Tear Analyzer to characterize crack propagation behavior of rubber powder modified rubber blends.

The effect of the <b>conveyer</b> <b>belt</b> on the nonwoven’s thermo-fluid flow behaviour is investigated in detail. A hybrid model consisting of the discrete <b>conveyer</b> <b>belt</b> geometry and the continuum porous nonwoven web, is presented. A comparison study to predict the thermal and flow field differences in 3 D and 2 D formulations of the same problem is elucidated. The thermal and fluid flow distributions within the <b>conveyer</b> <b>belt,</b> nonwoven and the air domain are predicted with particular focus on the <b>conveyer</b> <b>belt</b> component of the Low & BONAR pilot machine.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} list of {{companies}} implementing radio frequency identification (RFID) systems to help optimize their supply chain processes. These companies realize that a successful RFID system can potentially lead to lower supply chain inventory levels, reduced operating expenses, and greater visibility throughout the supply chain. However, since RFID technology is still relatively immature, a majority of the applications experience less than perfect read rates for tagged items moving through the supply chain. This paper reports the results for a variety of different arrangements of variables that may influence the readability of the RFID tags in a <b>conveyer</b> <b>belt</b> environment. The variables tested for this study were tag placement on the package, tag orientation, <b>conveyer</b> <b>belt</b> speed, tag type, package contents, and the reader antenna distance from the <b>conveyer</b> <b>belt.</b> The goal of this research was to determine how these variables influenced the readability of the RFID tags.

40|$|This article {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the combined use of object-oriented programming and simulation, with the objective of analysing and planning the logistic functions of a firm. An object-oriented simulation approach is used to evaluate the reception and distribution function of a courier firm. Both the reception of and operations (sorting) on the parcels in the plant were simulated. The first objective of the firm was to analyse the productivity of the <b>conveyer</b> <b>belts</b> and workers in the sorting plant of the courier firm. The firm's utilisation of most of its resources is fairly good, but it is possible to obtain a more efficient process by restructuring its activities. Results from the simulation study showed an imbalance in the capacities of the workstations. Some of the workers, especially those {{to the end of the}} <b>conveyer</b> <b>belts,</b> spent almost all of their time waiting for parcels to reach them, while those at the beginning were working at maximum capacity. This is mainly due to the layout and structure of the system. The biggest bottleneck in the system was the capacity of the coupling between two of the <b>conveyer</b> <b>belts.</b> The conclusion was that the firm should seriously consider redesigning the plant. This is the first computer model of the firm's business activities that can be used as a planning tool, and fills a gap in its current planning function. This simulation can be used to determine where and how workers should be applied in the sorting process. The complete simulation model reaches its potential when used as a strategic operational tool, by forecasting the expected results from changing operations and plant layout. A new plant layout has been proposed to the firm, which the model shows to result in substantial improvements in the productivity of the workers, allowing a reduction in their numbers...|$|R

30|$|The {{main focus}} of this article has been the {{theoretical}} investigation of the divided <b>conveyer</b> <b>belt</b> based on the probabilistic treatment of an idealized model with two input stations. The reduction of input performance has been quantified in terms of the worst-case average idle time that can occur due to mutual impediment.

In particular, with an optimal choice of the acceleration factor of the divided <b>conveyer</b> <b>belt</b> feeding system (a = 2) in combination with an optimal choice of the width of the input area (b_E = 3 l_min), the effect of mutual impediment can be completely eliminated.|$|E
