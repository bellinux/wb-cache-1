The Terrex submitted for the ACV program, called the Terrex 2, is designed to enhance situational awareness, with the troop commander's station equipped with a screen covering all aspects outside the vehicle, also visible to the squad to enable them to see what they would be exiting to. The driver’s station is equipped with several screens with obstacle avoidance, situational awareness sensor feeds, and other features. Although the Terrex is specialised in ground operations, it also meets the minimum requirements for safe sea operation. The Terrex has a V-over-V hull that creates a <b>crush</b> <b>zone</b> to reduce the impact of a blast on the floor; this creates a spacious interior. Footrests attached to seats across the aisle keep the Marines' feet from absorbing blast energy. The vehicle uses a central tire inflation system, can swim 7 mph in water, and has excess buoyancy of 23 percent. It weighs 32.5 tons (65,000 lb), carries three crew and 11 embarked Marines, and can reach 55 mph on paved roads.

40|$|Collapse dolines {{are among}} the most {{striking}} surface features in karst areas. Although they can be the result of different formation mechanisms, evidence suggests that large collapse dolines form due to chemical and mechanical removal of material at and below the level of groundwater. We have applied a genetic model of a two-dimensional fracture network to calculate the rate of dissolutional bedrock removal in the heavily fractured (<b>crushed)</b> <b>zone</b> intersecting a karst conduit in the phreatic zone. To account for infilling and breakdown processes in the <b>crushed</b> <b>zone</b> two simple rules were added to the basic model: 1) continuous infilling of dissolutionally created voids prevents fractures from growing beyond some limited aperture, although the dissolution proceeds, 2) discontinuous collapsing causes sudden closure of a fracture once some critical aperture has been reached. Both rules limit the transmissivity of the network and the related flow rates. Therefore, the constant head difference between the input and the output points is sustained and the flow remains distributed over the entire <b>crushed</b> <b>zone.</b> Provided that restrictions posed by the two rules permit turbulent flow, dissolution rates also remain high in the entire region. High surface area of water-rock contact and high dissolution rates result in high overall removal rates of rock from the <b>crushed</b> <b>zone,</b> one of the necessary conditions for the formation of large closed depressions. Despite the fact that the model neglects some processes and dynamics that would increase the removal rate, the results suggest that large closed depressions could form in the order of 1 million years...|$|R

Refinement of the theory revealed that the solutions for the change of linear and angular velocity are unaffected. For long-running in-depth research studies, this means that historical calculations of velocity change (delta-V) and related analyses on such topics as injury risk curves, countermeasure effectiveness and accident scenarios are not potentially undermined.

40|$|A {{geometrical}} {{model for the}} rock <b>crushed</b> <b>zone</b> around a cylindrical charge is developed. The model is used to obtain empirical relationships between the scaled <b>crushed</b> <b>zone</b> diameter and some dimensionless ratios of explosive and rock properties. The ratios are velocity ratio, characteristic impedance ratio, medium stress ratio, and detonation pressure ratio. The empirical relations for granite, salt, and limestone in combination {{with a variety of}} explosives show that the scaled <b>crushed</b> <b>zone</b> diameter increases at a decreasing rate with increasing dimensionless ratios. The shape of the wave fronts around a cylindrical charge detonating in rock has been constructed for velocity ratios ranging from infinity to less than one. The shape of the wave front is not planar in the range of dimensions used in full scale bench blasting. The shape of the wave front is cylindrical in the middle and spherical at the top and bottom for infinite velocity ratio; sphero-conical for velocity ratios greater than one; spherical for velocity ratios ≤ 1. Quasi-static finite element models for a blasthole in a full scale bench blasting are analyzed using a 2 -D finite element program written by the author. The models include a model neglecting radial cracks, models considering pressurized and non-pressurized radial cracks around the blasthole, and a model using an equivalent cavity to replace the pressurized radial cracks. Displacement fields, stress fields, and strain energy density distribution are studied. The analyses show that including radial cracks increases the levels of the strain energy density contours and the magnitudes of the displacement and stress fields several fold. The equivalent cavity gives much lower levels of strain energy contours and gives lower displacement and stress field magnitudes than those produced by the pressurized radial cracks. The scaled areas of the strain energy density contours increase at a decreasing rate with increasing the blasthole internal pressure and with increasing the ratio of the compressive strength to the tensile strength. These contour areas decrease at a decreasing rate with increasing tensile strength...|$|R
40|$|The rock {{fragmentation}} {{process by}} mechanical tools is investigated using numerical method. The rock and tool interaction code (R-T 2 D) is first developed {{on the basis}} of the rock failure process analysis (RFPA) model and the finite element analysis (FEA) method. Then a series of numerical tests for the typical physical-mechanical and fracture mechanical experiments are conducted to calibrate the R-T 2 D code. Finally, the rock fragmentation processes in mechanical fragmentation, such as rock cutting, rock drilling and rock crushing are modelled using the R-T 2 D code. On the basis of the obtained results, it is pointed out that in rock cutting, there are a number of peculiarities in cutting heterogeneous brittle rock. In rock drilling, the rock fragmentation process is in fact a chipping process caused by side cracks. The side crack is initiated from the <b>crushed</b> <b>zone</b> or bifurcated from Hertzian cracks, and propagates approximately parallel to the free rock surface but in a curvilinear path driven by the tensile stress associated with the expansion of the <b>crushed</b> <b>zone</b> during the loading process. The length of side crack can be approximately predicted according to a formulated semi-empirical and semi-theoretical relationship among the side crack length, the rock properties and the drilling force. The <b>crushed</b> <b>zone</b> under mechanical tools is in fact a zone with a high density of microcracks, where microcracking is pervasive and rocks behave in a ductile cataclastic manner with stress satisfying the ductile failure surface of the double elliptic strength criterion. In the simultaneous loading by multiple button- bits, the interaction and coalescence of side cracks induced by the neighbouring button-bits with an optimum line spacing provide a possibility of forming largest rock chips, controlling the direction of subsurface cracks and consuming a minimum specific energy. In rock crushing, two kinds of fracture patterns are recognized: the quasi-uniaxial compressive fracture pattern and the quasi-triaxial compressive fracture pattern.
