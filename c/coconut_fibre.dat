40|$|In this paper, {{methods of}} thermal, {{mechanical}} and surface analyses of biodegradable PCL/PLA composites {{with the addition}} of different concentrations of <b>coconut</b> <b>fibres</b> were performed. The aim was to assess the potential of these composite materials for the relief-printing plates as an alternative to classical photopolymer materials. Differential scanning calorimetry, surface free energy calculations and hardness measurements were performed on the samples. Results have shown that most thermal transitions that are characteristic for PLA and PCL do not take place in the area of temperatures applicable in the printing process. Most thermal transitions were not affected by the addition of <b>coconut</b> <b>fibres.</b> <b>Coconut</b> <b>fibres</b> in the composite structure contributed to the increased hardness of the material. Moreover, the hardness range of the prepared PCL/PLA composites was within the range of some classic photopolymer printing plates. By adding <b>coconut</b> <b>fibres</b> in higher concentrations, surface free energy of the materials decreased, which enables a wider application of the material for the production of printing plates. From the obtained results it can be concluded that there is a potential for the use of PCL/PLA biodegradable composite materials in the manufacture of various relief-printing plates for different printing techniques (letterpress, embossing, label printing) ...|$|R

The CAT and APX activities significantly varied depending on the cultivar, the nutrient substrate type and the time of exposure to low temperature. Cv. Oblica and cv. Leccino growing on <b>coconut</b> <b>fibres</b> showed a better antioxidative response to low temperature probably due to the higher nitrogen and phosphorus concentration established in this type of nutrient substrate.

40|$|Cork powder, {{the most}} {{important}} sub-product of cork processing, combined with thermoplastic matrixes like, high density polyethylene (HDPE), offer {{a new class of}} cork-polymer composite (CPC) materials with high added-value. Therefore, reinforcing strategies must be considered to increase the mechanical performance, especially when high content of cork powder is added to the formulation. <b>Coconut</b> <b>fibres</b> have several advantages, such as, low density, renewable source, low cost and biodegradability. The use of these fibres on the reinforcement of CPC materials will not only contribute to improve the mechanical performance but also for increasing the amount of natural component present on the final composition. The main goal of this work was to prepare HDPE/cork (50 - 50 wt. %) composites reinforced with discontinuous <b>coconut</b> <b>fibres</b> (5 and 10 wt. %) with and without the addition of coupling agent (2 wt. %) by extrusion. The developed reinforced cork based composites were characterized regarding its morphology and mechanical performance. Optical micrographs have shown a homogeneous distribution of the fibres. The coupling agent effect on CPC performance was also investigated. The tensile strength and tensile modulus of the reinforced composites were significantly improved with the addition of coupling agent. The use of 10 wt. % of <b>coconut</b> <b>fibres</b> in the presence of coupling agent promote an increase on maximum tensile strength of around 41 % comparing with the HDPE/cork (50 - 50 wt. %) composites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the tensile fractured specimens confirmed that the use of coupling agent promoted the interfacial adhesion between the fibres and the thermoplastic matrix. Since, like cork powder, <b>coconut</b> <b>fibres</b> have good thermal and acoustic properties, we consider that the novel reinforced CPC herein described have high potential to be used in building and construction systems and other structural 3 D applications.
