Regardless of these major changes, Finnish insurance companies have not yet shown great interest in supplying insurance schemes. We strongly believe that this is due to uncertainty over the yields to be insured. Asymmetric information is a well-established phenomenon in the insurance industry. In yield insurances, it results from farmers having better knowledge of their yields than insurance companies. This paper estimates the unknown and latent farm-level crop yield distribution that is consistent with the indemnity frequency realized under the CDC programme implemented in Finland. The frequency of granted indemnity payments reveals the underlying yield density function interest among potential yield insurance companies. The estimated yield distribution is normalized to and compared with the aggregate level yield distribution as well as farm-level observations from various sources. The results reveal that no unambiguous answer exits for insurance company needs. 201...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effects of different irrigation depths for yellow melon production and on yield response factor to water (Ky) in the productive phase. The experiment was carried out in Fortaleza, state of Ceará, Brazil, in complete randomized blocks with six treatments, four replicates and six plants per plot. Treatments were applied from intermediate (III) to final (IV) physiological state with water depths equivalents to 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, 100 %, 125 % and 150 % of the crop evapotranspiration (ETc).

Our study aimed at characterizing and explaining young M. giganteus yield variability on a farmers' field network located in the supply area of a cooperative society in east central France. It included the first three growth years of the crop. We defined and calculated a set of indicators of limiting factors that could be involved in yield variations and used the mixed-model method to identify those explaining most of the <b>yield</b> variation. <b>Commercial</b> <b>yields</b> averaged 8. 1 and 12. 8 t DM ha(- 1) for the second and third growth year, respectively. However, these mean results concealed a high variability, ranging from 3 to 19 t DM ha(- 1). <b>Commercial</b> <b>yields,</b> measured on whole fields, were on average 20 % lower than plot yields, measured on a small area (two plots of 25 m(2)).

We highlighted that planting success was decisive and was built during the whole plantation year. Fields with the lowest yields also had the highest weed cover, which was influenced by the distance between the field and the farmhouse, the preceding crop and the soil type. Our findings show that growing young M. giganteus on farmers' fields involves limiting factors different from those commonly reported in the literature for experimental conditions and they could be useful to assess the economic and environmental impacts of growing M. giganteus on farmers' fields.
