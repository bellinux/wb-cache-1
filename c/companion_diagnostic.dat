40|$|The value {{proposition}} of Personalized Medicine is {{to deliver the}} “right drug, to the right patient, at the right time”. <b>Companion</b> <b>diagnostics</b> is the required tool for Personalized Medicine used to aid clinical decision making with the aim to identify patients who are most suitable for a given treatment approach and to avoid adverse effects. However, even 16 {{years after the first}} co-approval of a therapeutic drug and an associated diagnostic test (trastuzumab (Herceptin 1) from Genentech and the HercepTest 1 from Dako), the co-development and co-approval of drug-diagnostic pairs is a challenging task. This study has the aim to identify major challenges for diagnostics companies when developing and commercializing <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics.</b> This is achieved by (1) a literature research and (2) an empirical case study in form of interviews with diagnostics companies. The collected data is analyzed and discussed with focus on current regulatory and reimbursement frameworks in the USA and European Union. The co-development strategies and business models of <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics</b> developers are identified. The conclusion {{of this study is that}} the major hurdles for <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics</b> development and commercialization are gaps in scientific evidence and lacking regulatory guidelines for co-development and clinical biomarker studies. <b>Companion</b> <b>diagnostics</b> commercialization is further challenged by poor reimbursement levels. The main strategy of diagnostics companies to address these challenges is the demonstration of a beneficial outcome for patients in form of clinical studies. Small companies with limited resources for clinical research receive funding from academic research grants, patient support groups, pharmaceutical industry, and governmental Innovation agencies.

30|$|Nonetheless, <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics</b> and software, data {{analytics}} {{and other information}} technology advancements all {{have the potential to}} create a significant commercial benefit in markets with pricing flexibility in terms of market share, but are likely to be of higher value for later-to-market entrants. This {{is due to the fact}} that <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics</b> and corresponding theranostic assays divide the market of treatable patients into groups and clusters, thus reducing market share. A companion drug, however, that is capable of identifying a group of patients that responds to a specific therapy very well, enables higher pricing and thus generates value to stakeholders. In this regard, the key is the payer’s price sensitivity that varies a lot by disease area; therefore, drug classes can be segmented according to their scientific and commercial potential.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Many cancer {{treatments}} benefit {{only a minority}} of patients who receive them. This results in an enormous burden on patients and on the health care system. The problem will become even greater with the increasing use of molecularly targeted agents whose benefits {{are likely to be more}} selective unless the drug development process is modified to include codevelopment of <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics.</b> Whole genome biotechnology and decreasing costs of genome sequencing make it increasingly possible to achieve an era of predictive medicine in oncology therapeutics. The challenges are numerous and substantial but are not primarily technological. They involve organizing publicly funded diagnostics of deregulated pathways, adopting new paradigms for drug development, and developing incentives for industry to incur the complex-ity and expense of codevelopment of drugs and <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics.</b> This article reviews some designs for phase III clinical trials that may facilitate movement to a more predictive oncology.

Molecular assays and diagnostic imaging are routinely being used to stratify patients for treatment, monitor disease, and provide reliable early clinical phase assessments. The importance of diagnostic approaches in drug development is highlighted by the rapidly expanding global cancer diagnostics market and the emergent attention of regulatory agencies worldwide, who are beginning to offer more structured platforms and guidance for this area. In this paper, we highlight the key benefits of using <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics</b> and diagnostic imaging {{with a focus on}} oncology clinical trials. Nuclear imaging using widely available radiopharmaceuticals in conjunction with molecular imaging of oncology targets has opened the door to more accurate disease assessment and the modernization of standard criteria for the evaluation, staging, and treatment responses of cancer patients. Furthermore, the introduction and validation of quantitative molecular imaging continues to drive and optimize the field of oncology diagnostics. Given their pivotal role in disease assessment and treatment, the validation and commercialization of diagnostic tools will continue to advance oncology clinical trials, support new oncology drugs, and promote better patient outcomes.

Over 2 decades of research has advanced {{the understanding of the}} molecular substructure of breast cancer, directing the development of new therapeutic strategies against these actionable targets. In vitro <b>diagnostics,</b> and specifically <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics,</b> have been integral in the successful development and implementation of these targeted therapies, such as those directed against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Lately, there has been a surge in the development, commercialization, and marketing of diagnostic assays to assist in breast cancer patient care. More recently, multigene signature assays, such as Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, and Prosigna, have been integrated in the clinical setting in order to tailor decisions on adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy treatment.

40|$|Background: Personalized {{medicine}} is gradually {{emerging as a}} transformative field. Thus far, seven co-developed drug-diagnostic combinations have been approved and several dozen post-hoc drug-diagnostic combinations (diagnostic approved after the drug). However, barriers remain, {{particularly with respect to}} reimbursement. Purpose, methods: This study analyzes barriers facing uptake of drug-diagnostic combinations. We examine Medicare reimbursement in the U. S. of 10 drug-diagnostic combinations {{on the basis of a}} formulary review and a survey. Findings: We found that payers reimburse all 10 drugs, but with variable and relatively high patient co-insurance, as well as imposition of formulary restrictions. Payer reimbursement of <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics</b> is limited and highly variable. In addition, we found that the body of evidence on the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of therapeutics is thin and even less robust for diagnostics. Conclusions, discussion: The high cost of personalized therapeutics and dearth of evidence concerning the comparative clinical effectiveness of drug-diagnostic combinations appear to contribute to high patient cost sharing, imposition of formulary restrictions, and limited and variable reimbursement of <b>companion</b> <b>diagnostics.</b> Our findings point to the need to increase the evidence base supportive of establishing linkage between diagnostic testing and positive health outcomes...|$|R
