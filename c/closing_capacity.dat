50|$|The <b>closing</b> <b>capacity</b> (CC) is {{the volume}} {{in the lungs}} at which its {{smallest}} airways, the respiratory bronchioles, collapse. The alveoli lack supporting cartilage and so depend on other factors to keep them open. The <b>closing</b> <b>capacity</b> {{is greater than the}} residual volume (RV), the amount of gas that normally remains in the lungs during respiration, and specifically, after forced expiration. This is because <b>closing</b> <b>capacity</b> is equal to closing volume plus residual volume. This means that there is normally enough air within the lungs to keep these airways open throughout both inhalation and exhalation. As the lungs age, there is a gradual increase in the <b>closing</b> <b>capacity</b> (i.e. The small airways begin to collapse at a higher volume/before expiration is complete). This also occurs with certain disease processes, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary edema. Any process that increases the CC by increasing the functional residual capacity (FRC) can increase an individual's risk of hypoxemia, as the small airways may collapse during exhalation, leading to air trapping and atelectasis.|$|E

Portopulmonary or intrapulmonary shunts were postulated as a primary cause of hypoxaemia in cirrhotic patients since anatomical communica-tions between the portal vein and the pulmonary venous system were observed in necropsy material (Calabresi and Abelmann, 1957) and produced in experimental animals (Khaliq, Kay, and Heath, 1972). The physiological significance of this shunt flow was studied by Nakamura et al. (1965) who found no positive correlation between such flow and hypoxaemia.

30|$|Atelectases develop if the lung’s <b>closing</b> <b>capacity</b> (CC) {{drops below}} the {{functional}} residual capacity (FRC). FRC can be increased by increasing PEEP while CC depends on various factors, i.e., on pulmonary disease, age, or patients’ positioning. To allow for inter-individual comparison, we ventilated all patients with a standardized PEEP during the intervention. The PEEP level chosen for our study may have been high enough to keep FRC well above the CC in our patients, therefore preventing the formation of atelectases even with a FiO 2 of 1.0. While a fall in EELI may just reflect aeration loss, regional tidal volume changes (and tidal impedance variation) need not change if FRC is maintained and the lung units still operate in the linear part of regional pressure–volume curves.|$|E

40|$|Cyclopropane {{was found}} to produce no {{significant}} changes in pulmonary vascular resistance or the pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to alveolar hypoxia in isolated cat lungs perfused at constant flow. During the past decade evidence has accumulated to {{support the hypothesis that}} the increase in alveolar-arterial oxygen partial pressure difference during anaesthesia is associated with an increase in airway closure secondary to a reduction in functional residual capacity (Hewlett et al., 1974 a, b). However, in a recent review Rehder and others (1977) con-cluded that "the suggestion that the relationship between <b>closing</b> <b>capacity</b> and functional residual capacity may underlie the impaired pulmonary gas exchange seen during anesthesia has not been clearly established and must be examined further". The present authors have proffered an alternative hypothesis by suggesting that anaesthetic drugs may increase the blood flow to underventilated alveoli either by a direct or indirect action on the pulmonary vasculature or by depression of the pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to alveolar hypoxia (Sykes et al., 1972). Support for this hypothesis has been provided by studies which have shown that anaes-thetic concentrations of halothane, trichloroethylene, ether, methoxyflurane and nitrous oxide depress reversibly the pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to alveolar hypoxia in the isolated, perfused cat lun...|$|E

MethodsFor this prospective double-blind double-dummy randomized study, 66 stable asthma patients under maintenance iCS (equivalent budesonide ≤  800  μg/day) were screened for abnormal baseline acinar ventilation heterogeneity (Sacin). After a 3 -week run-in period, 35 eligible patients were randomized to fine particle beclomethasone (HFA-BDP; Qvar Autohaler) or to budesonide (DPI-BUD; Pulmicort Turbohaler). Asthma Control Test (ACT) score and various lung function indices reflecting the small airways were obtained at baseline, after 6 and 12 weeks. ResultsThirty one patients [age: 52  ±  17 (SD) years; FEV 1 : 76  ±  19 (SD) %pred] completed the study (DPI-BUD:n =  16; HFA-BDP:n =  15).

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that stomata {{developed}} under long-term high relative air humidity (RH = 85 %) are malfunctional, resulting in a poor control of water loss. Yet, {{little is known about the}} dynamics of stomatal adaptation to moderate RH, and the possibilities to improve or reverse the destabilized stomatal responsiveness. In this study, a reciprocal transfer experiment was conducted in climate chambers using Rosa hybrida ‘Prophyta’, grown at moderate RH (60 %) or at high RH (90 %). The adaptation of fully developed leaves to the new RH environment was assessed at day 0, 4, 8 and 12 after plant transfer by measuring the transpiration rate in detached leaves. Stomata fully developed at high RH had a lower <b>closing</b> <b>capacity</b> in response to a decrease in leaf Relative Water Content (RWC) (i. e. water loss was considerably high at RWC below 20 %, whereas in moderate RH stomata the water loss almost ceased at 57 % RWC). Furthermore, stomata developed at high RH did not become functional after 12 days of cultivation at moderate RH. Similarly, stomata developed at moderate RH and transferred to high RH for a 12 day period did not loose their ability to close in response to desiccation. This indicates that stomatal functionality is determined during leaf development, while after this period stomata have a limited capacity to adapt to new RH environment.

40|$|Alveolar {{nitric oxide}} (NO) {{is a measure}} of {{peripheral}} airway inflammation in asthma, potentially associated with disease severity. The relationship between alveolar NO and physiological tests of peripheral airway (dys) function has not been investigated. The present authors hypothesised that peripheral airway inflammation and dysfunction are inter-related and associated with asthma severity. Alveolar NO was compared between 17 patients with mild-to-moderate asthma and 14 patients with severe asthma and related to total lung capacity (TLC), residual volume (RV) /TLC, thoracic gas volume (FRC), slope of the single breath nitrogen washout curve (dN 2), <b>closing</b> <b>capacity</b> (CC) /TLC and fall in forced vital capacity at the provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20 % fall in forced expiratory volume in one second. In patients with severe asthma, strong correlations were found between alveolar NO and RV/TLC % pred, FRC % pred, dN 2, and CC/TLC. Patients with oral steroid-dependent asthma had higher alveolar NO levels (2. 7 ppb) compared with the other patients with severe (0. 6 ppb) and mild-to-moderate asthma (0. 3 ppb). The present authors conclude that alveolar nitric oxide is closely related to parameters of peripheral airway dysfunction in patients with severe asthma, and that oral steroid-dependent asthmatics have more peripheral airway disease than nonsteroid-dependent asthmatics. This suggests that patients on chronic oral steroid treatment have more extensive disease and require additional anti-inflammatory treatment to better target the peripheral airway...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cyclic {{opening and}} closing of lung units during tidal {{breathing}} {{may be an important}} cause of iatrogenic lung injury. We hypothesized that airway closure is uncommon in children with healthy lungs when inspiratory pressures are kept low, but paradoxically may occur when inspiratory pressures are increased. Methods: Elastic equilibrium volume (EEV) and <b>closing</b> <b>capacity</b> (CC) were measured with a tracer gas (SF 6) technique in 11 anesthetized, muscle-relaxed, endotracheally intubated and artificially ventilated healthy children, aged 0. 6 - 13 years. Airway closing was studied in a randomized order at two inflation pressures, + 20 or + 30 cmH(2) O, and CC and CC/EEV were calculated from the plots obtained when the lungs were exsufflated to - 20 cmH(2) O. (CC/EEV > 1 indicates that airway closure might occur during tidal breathing). Furthermore, a measure of uneven ventilation, multiple breath alveolar mixing efficiency (MBAME), was obtained. Results: Airway closure within the tidal volume (CC/EEV> 1) was observed in four and eight children (not significant, NS) after 20 and 30 cmH(2) O inflation, respectively. However, CC 30 /EEV was>CC 20 /EEV in all children (Pless than or equal to 0. 001). The MBAME was 75 +/- 7 % (normal) and did not correlate with CC/EEV. Conclusion: Airway closure within tidal volumes may occur in artificially ventilated healthy children during ventilation with low inspiratory pressure. However, the risk of airway closure and thus opening within the tidal volume increases when the inspiratory pressures are increased...|$|E

The way firms cope with financial constraints {{is fundamental to}} the analysis of monetary transmission, of financial stability and of economic growth and development. The CBI Industrial Trends Survey contains detailed information on the financial constraints faced by a large sample of UK manufacturers. This paper uses the quarterly CBI Industrial Trends Survey firm-level data between January 1989 and October 1999. The cleaned sample contains 49, 244 quarterly observations on 5, 196 firms. The data set is presented and a new method of checking the informational content of the data is developed. The relationship between investment activity and financial constraints is ambivalent because both can affect each other and they are affected by the same kind of economic developments, so it is not clear which is driving the other. But the link between financial constraints faced by the firm and the prevalence and duration of capacity restrictions should be unambiguously positive. Looking at that relationship, two important results emerge. First, financially constrained firms take longer to <b>close</b> <b>capacity</b> gaps. This indicates that financial constraints do indeed play a part in the investment process.
