40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} simple and robust {{adaptive}} specular BSDF evaluation algorithm based of stochastic progressive photon mapping. This algorithm can handle scenes that are considered difficult for most of current simulation approaches which deal with mixed diffuse and specular objects. By contrast, our approach can handle highly specular scene such as <b>car</b> <b>lamps</b> and light guide. The proposed method is simple to implement, needs very small memory for data structures and the resulting image {{does not depend on}} parameters. The method can produce bias- and noise-free images. The contribution of this paper is in two folds. First, we propose {{a simple and}} straightforward method for estimation of light transport of highly specular scenes. Then, we demonstrate an efficient approximation of the exact method by a real-time GPU-based implementation. As with progressive photon mapping, the algorithm repeats two passes, the eye-pass and the photon-pass. The first pass traces rays from the observer through the scene and stores a hit-point on the first surface hit. This hit-point is associated with a search radius and the BSDF of the surface. On the second pass, photons are traced from the light sources through the scene and their energy is splatted at each hit-point. The contributed energy for each hit-point depends on its associated BSDF and gathering radius. At the end of each eye-pass the gathering radius of hit-points is reduced. This ensures that the error associated with the light density estimation associated with each hit-point will diminish and that it will converge to the correct value. In our method, the rendering starts with a near-diffuse glossy BSDF and, through passes, the glossiness is raised to converge to a highly glossy BSDF which will converge to a specular BSDF in the limit. This method behaves exactly as progressive photon mapping regarding convergence properties. The trade-off between initial bias and variance is controlled by initial gathering radius. The amount of variance that unbiased method gives on this kind of scene is replaced by initial bias which will converge to zero as more photons are used in the approximation. Because the method relies on storing the hit-points on the first intersected surface, we can do the gathering step in screen-space which perfectly fits on GPU device. If bias-free results are not needed, the algorithm becomes point of view-independent and therefore suitable for real-time visualization of scene with quality only limited by the amount of photons the GPU device can store...|$|E

40|$|As vehicle {{population}} increases, {{the number}} of road accidents also increases. Vital problems in transportation such as mobility and safety of transportation considered more, especially in metropolitans and highway. It {{is because of the}} reflection or refraction of light from different directions also contributed to this accident. Due from that, the driver could not identify the types of lamps in their environment whether it is street <b>lamp</b> or <b>car</b> <b>lamp</b> from others. When other drivers use the high beam from the opposite direction, will cause the view is blurred and glare. Due to that, many road users can be stuck with unintentional accident.

Basically, this project is to differentiate between LED Street <b>Lamp</b> and <b>car</b> <b>lamp</b> to ignore LED noise when it is combined each other. The main purpose of this project is to enhance the automated high beam detection system using image processing technique in MATLAB, to detect LED street lamp for automated high beam detection and also to detect the vehicle-rear lamp within its proper distance for automated high beam detection. In order to implement this project, it was conducted with computer simulation (MATLAB) by using image processing method.

40|$|Abstract — Instantaneous image {{motion in}} a camera {{on-board}} a mobile robot contains rich {{information about the}} structure of the environment. We present a new framework, optical flow templates, for capturing this information and an experimental proof-of-concept that labels superpixels using them. Optical flow templates encode the possible optical flow fields due to egomotion for a specific environment shape and robot attitude. We label optical flow in superpixels with the environment shape they image according to how consistent they are with each template. Specifically, in this paper we employ templates highly relevant to mobile robot navigation. Image regions consistent with ground plane and distant structure templates likely indicate free and traversable space, while image regions consistent with neither of these are likely to be nearby objects that are obstacles. We evaluate our method qualitatively and quantitatively in an urban driving scenario, labeling the ground plane, and obstacles such as passing <b>cars,</b> <b>lamp</b> posts, and parked cars. One key advantage of this framework is low computational complexity, and we demonstrate per-frame computation times of 20 ms, excluding optical flow and superpixel calculation. I...|$|R
