40|$|BACKGROUND: Endoscopic {{differentiation}} {{and removal}} of potentially premalignant sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs) {{may be important}} steps in preventing the development of colorectal cancer in hyperplastic polyposis syndrome (HPS). OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of high-resolution endoscopy, autofluorescence imaging (AFI), and narrow-band imaging (NBI) for differentiating polyps in HPS. DESIGN: A prospective polyp series. SETTING: Single tertiary referral center. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Seven patients with HPS underwent colonoscopy with endoscopic trimodal imaging, which incorporates high-resolution endoscopy, AFI, and NBI in 1 system. All detected polyps were analyzed with AFI for color and with NBI for Kudo pit pattern and vascular pattern intensity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of AFI and NBI in differentiating detected polyps were determined by using histology as the criterion standard. RESULTS: A total of 19 hyperplastic polyps (HPs), 32 SSAs, and 15 adenomas were detected. For differentiating SSAs <b>from</b> <b>HPs,</b> AFI color, Kudo pit pattern, and vascular pattern intensity resulted in a diagnostic accuracy of 55 %, 55 %, and 52 %, respectively. For differentiating adenomas <b>from</b> <b>HPs,</b> the accuracy was 65 %, 94 %, and 90 %, respectively. Macroscopically, {{the combination of a}} size of 3 mm or larger and a proximal location resulted in the highest accuracy (76 %) for differentiating SSAs <b>from</b> <b>HPs.</b> LIMITATION: Small sample size. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic differentiation between HPs and SSAs by using endoscopic trimodal imaging proved unsatisfactory. Differentiation of adenomas <b>from</b> <b>HPs</b> was possible with NBI but not with AF...|$|R
