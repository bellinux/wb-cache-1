5|$|There are {{concerns}} {{as to whether}} breeding hairless and tailless rats is ethical. The tail is vital for rats' balance and for adjusting body temperature. Tailless rats have greater risk of heat exhaustion, poor bowel and bladder control, falling from heights, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> risk for life-threatening deformities in the pelvic region like hind leg paralysis and megacolon. Similarly, hairless rats are less protected from scratches and the cold without their coat. Groups such as the NFRS prohibit the showing of these varieties at their events and forbid advertisement through affiliated services.|$|E
5|$|All YouTube {{users can}} upload videos up to 15 minutes each in duration. Users {{who have a}} good track record of {{complying}} with the site's Community Guidelines may be offered the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length, as well as live streams, which requires verifying the account, normally through a mobile phone. When YouTube was launched in 2005, {{it was possible to}} upload longer videos, but a ten-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films. The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010. In the past, it was possible to upload videos longer than 12 hours. Videos <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> most 128 GB in size. Video captions are made using speech recognition technology when uploaded. Such captioning is usually not perfectly accurate, so YouTube provides several options for manually entering the captions for greater accuracy.|$|E

5|$|Health {{issues in}} American {{football}} comprise {{a large number}} of health risks associated with participating in the sport. Injuries are relatively common in American football, due to its nature as a full-contact game. Injuries occur during both practice and games. Several factors can affect the frequency of injuries: epidemiological studies have shown older players <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> a greater risk, while equipment and experienced coaches can reduce the risk of injury. Common injuries include strains, sprains, fractures, dislocations, and concussions. Concussions have become a concern, as they increase the risk of mental illnesses like dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In individual leagues like the National Football League (NFL) and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), a public injury report is published containing all injured players on a team, their injury and the game-day status of each player.|$|E
5|$|Ichigo is {{voiced by}} Masakazu Morita in the Japanese anime, while {{as a child}} he is voiced by Yuki Matsuoka. Morita said that Ichigo {{was one of his}} {{favorite}} characters he ever played alongside Tidus from Final Fantasy X. Johnny Yong Bosch voices him in the English dub as a teenager, and Mona Marshall as a kid. While describing Ichigo as one of his best roles, Morita notes that voicing him <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> times difficult. Bosch has enjoyed voicing Ichigo's character due to his personal interest in the character's morals. However, he experienced difficulty voicing him in some scenes where Ichigo shouts for a long time.|$|E
5|$|This {{species has}} a {{courtship}} flight conducted above the trees. The pair fly on a strongly oscillating path with one bird ascending {{while the other}} is descending, both calling constantly. After display, the birds land on a branch for a mating ritual which starts with locking bills, followed by the female hanging upside-down for a variable period of time, and then copulation while the male holds the female's neck. The flight and mating rituals have been recorded for three-coloured and red-throated parrotfinches, and may be typical for the genus. The nest is built with fresh grass blades, and is domed with a side entrance. It is always hidden in thick foliage, but <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> any height from the ground. The normal clutch is four spherical whitish eggs. Chicks are naked and have pinkish skin; the distinctive gape has blue nodular spots technically termed as papillae or tubercles at {{the upper and lower}} corners, and the yellow palate has a ring of five black spots. Most young estrildid finches beg for food with their wings held against the side, but juvenile parrotfinches lift the wing on the side away from the feeding parent. This behaviour may restrict competition for food from other nestlings.|$|E

25|$|Central Maui {{consists}} {{primarily of}} Kahului and Wailuku. Kahului is literally {{the center of}} the island, and tends to keep steady, high temperatures throughout the year. The micro-climate in Kahului <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> times muggy, but it usually feels relatively dry and is often very breezy. The Wailuku area is set closer to the West Maui Mountain range. Here, more rainfall will be found throughout the year, and higher humidity levels.|$|E
25|$|Early {{retirement}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> any age, but {{is generally}} {{before the age}} (or tenure) needed for eligibility for support and funds from government or employer-provided sources. Thus, early-retirees rely on their own savings and investments to be initially self-supporting, until they start receiving such external support. Early retirement is also a euphemistic term for accepting termination of employment before retirement age {{as part of the}} employer's labor force rationalization. In this case, a monetary inducement may be involved.|$|E

25|$|In May 1992, {{entertainment}} magazine The Hollywood Reporter {{reported that}} about 25% of Euro Disney's workforce – approximately 3,000 people – had resigned {{from their jobs}} because of unacceptable working conditions. It also reported that the park's attendance was far behind expectations. The disappointing attendance <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> least partly explained by the recession and increased unemployment, which was affecting France {{and most of the}} rest of the developed world at this time; when construction of the resort began, the economy was still on an upswing.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{at which}} an {{attacker}} can submit guessed passwords to the system is {{a key factor in}} determining system security. Some systems impose a time-out of several seconds after a small number (e.g. three) of failed password entry attempts. In the absence of other vulnerabilities, such systems can be effectively secured with relatively simple passwords. However the system must store information about the user passwords in some form and if that information is stolen, say by breaching system security, the user passwords <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> risk.|$|E
