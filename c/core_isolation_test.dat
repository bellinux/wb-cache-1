40|$|Cost {{effective}} SOC test strongly {{hinges on}} parallel, independent test of SOC cores, {{which can only}} be ensured through proper core isola-tion techniques. While a <b>core</b> <b>isolation</b> mechanism can provide con-trollability and observability at the core I/O interface, its implemen-tation may have various implications on area, functional timing, test time and data volume, and at-speed coverage on the core interface. In this paper, we propose a non-intrusive <b>core</b> <b>isolation</b> technique that is based on the utilization of existing core registers for isolating the core. We provide a core register partitioning algorithm that is capa-ble of identifying the core interface registers, and of robustly isolating a core, resulting in a computationally efficient <b>core</b> <b>isolation</b> imple-mentation that is area and performance efficient at the same time. The proposed isolation technique also ensures minimal test time increase and no at-speed coverage loss on the core interface, offering an el-egant solution for soft cores, and thus enabling significant SOC test cost reductions. 1...|$|R

5000|$|An {{electrical}} <b>isolation</b> <b>test</b> is {{a direct}} current (DC) resistance test that is performed between subcircuit common and subsystem chassis to verify that a specified level of isolation resistance is met. <b>Isolation</b> <b>testing</b> may also be conducted between one or more electrical circuits of the same subsystem. The test often reveals problems that occurred during assembly, such as defective/wrong component, improper component placement/orientation and wire insulation or insulator defects that may cause inadvertent shorting or grounding to chassis, in turn, compromising electrical circuit quality and product safety.|$|R
50|$|The reactor <b>core</b> <b>isolation</b> {{cooling system}} is not an {{emergency}} core cooling system proper, but it is included because it fulfills an important-to-safety function which can help to cool the reactor {{in the event of}} a loss of normal heat sinking capability; or when all electrical power is lost. It has additional functionality in advanced versions of the BWR.|$|R

50|$|The {{emergency}} cooling {{of the core}} is entrusted to three independent systems. A doubly redundant low pressure core spray with a 2·100% heat removal capacity is activated in case of leaks any size in the coolant system. Small leaks may be compensated by the redundant high pressure reactor <b>core</b> <b>isolation</b> cooling system (RCIC) or the redundant alternate low pressure system (ALPS).|$|R

For pipes which inject {{water into the}} containment, two safety-related check valves are generally used in lieu of motor operated valves. These valves must be tested regularly as well to ensure they do indeed seal and prevent leakage even against high reactor pressures.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fundamental {{studies have}} been carried out on the {{flammability}} aspects of decorative trimmings used on upholstered furniture. In addition to the trimmings being <b>tested</b> in <b>isolation,</b> <b>tests</b> were also carried out to assess their flammability in conjunction with flammable upholstery foam as well as with a variety of fabric/foam composites. The flammability has been assessed by ignition to a smouldering cigarette and by a match-equivalent butane flame on a BS 5852 rig. A test method has been proposed which is a modification of the US-UFAC test to include the assessment of trimming ignitability to a simulated match flame. The effect of live flame was found to be different from the effect of a smouldering cigarette. In live flame tests the pass/fail boundary was found to be dependent on the type of fabric covering the foam.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{efficient}} Non-Uniform Cache Architecture (NUCA) scheme for the Last-Level Cache (LLC) {{to reduce the}} average on-chip access latency and improve <b>core</b> <b>isolation</b> in Chip Multiprocessors (CMP). The architecture proposed is expected to improve upon the various NUCA schemes proposed so far such as S-NUCA, D-NUCA and SP-NUCA[9][10][5] in terms of average access latency without {{a significant reduction in}} the hit rate. The complete set of L 2 banks is divided into various zones. Each core belongs to one particular zone which is the closest to it. Consequently, adjacent cores are grouped into the same zone. Each zone individually follows the SP-NUCA scheme [5] for maintaining <b>core</b> <b>isolation</b> and sharing common blocks. However, blocks that need to be shared by cores which belong to different zones are replicated. This scheme is much more scalable than the SP-NUCA scheme and bounds the maximum on-chip access latency to a lower value as the number of cores increases. This paper merely details the proposed scheme. The claims made regarding the benefits of the scheme shall be substantiated through simulations and a detailed comparative study in the future. The intended simulation methodology and architectural framework to be used in this regard have also been mentioned...|$|R
40|$|Persistently {{infected}} animals (PI animals), that is those animals born after an intrauterine {{infection of the}} dam during the first 120 days of gestation, are {{the main source of}} bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVD virus) in a cattle population. The success of any BVD virus eradication programme depends on the ability to detect all PI animals at a young age. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the use of the antigen ELISA test and the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for the diagnosis of PI animals in the presence of maternal antibodies, and to compare them with the classical virus <b>isolation</b> <b>test.</b> In this experiment, 25 calves born after an experimental infection with a mixture of BVD virus field strains were used. All calves were found to be positive for BVD virus using the virus <b>isolation</b> <b>test,</b> both before the ingestion of colostrum and again at 10 weeks of age. Both the virus <b>isolation</b> <b>test</b> and the antigen ELISA test were shown to be unreliable indicators for the diagnosis of persistent infections with BVD virus, when used in the presence of high levels of maternal antibodies. However, the RT-PCR test gave positive results even in the presence of high maternal antibody titres, indicating the suitability of the RT-PCR test for use in eradication programmes...|$|R
40|$|The {{validity}} of the <b>isolation</b> <b>test</b> in manual muscle testing was investigated. The flexion force of the knee joint was measured for the following leg positions: lateral rotation, mid position and medial rotation. The results showed that muscle strength was the highest for lateral rotation, followed by mid position, and medial rotation, in this order (11. 08, 10. 69 and 9. 68 kg, respectively). If the flexion force of the knee joint in mid position {{is the sum of}} medial and lateral rotators, then flexion force should be highest in mid position, but this did not hold true. Also, if the activities of medial rotators are suppressed in lateral rotation, then flexion force should be decreased by the degree of suppression, but this did not hold true. The same applies to medial rotation. Hence, the <b>isolation</b> <b>test</b> in manual muscle testing lacks validity...|$|R

40|$|Intraventricular corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) was {{administered}} to guinea pig pups both with a freehand injection technique and via indwelling cannula. Behavioral effects depended upon the technique used. The highest dose of CRF (5 μg) inhibited the vocalizing of pups in a subsequent <b>isolation</b> <b>test</b> only when CRF was given by freehand injection. The possibility that disturbance attendant to the freehand procedure can account for this difference is discussed. To {{determine the effect of}} endogenous CRF in the absence of additional disturbance, the CRF antagonist α-helical CRF (ahCRF) {{was administered}} with the indwelling cannula procedure. ahCRF enhanced vocalizing during the first 10 min, and enhanced locomotor activity during the last 10 min, of a 30 -min <b>isolation</b> <b>test.</b> Overall, the results indicate that endogenous CRF reduces vocalizing and locomotion during social isolation and that under certain injection conditions exogenous CRF can exacerbate the behavioral effect. The results also demonstrate the potential impact of the technique used to administer exogenous CRF. Further, the prevailing view, that CRF mediates stress-related behavioral responses, is supported only if behavioral inhibition, rather than vocalizing or locomotor activity, is viewed as the stress-related response in this situation...|$|R
40|$|Capillary {{blood samples}} from 63 infants {{collected}} 3 - 7 days after birth, and thereafter stored on filter papers for 12 - 18 y, were {{tested for the}} presence of CMV DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Of 16 infants with proven congenital CMV infection (positive virus <b>isolation</b> <b>test</b> in urine sampled within 1 week of age), 13 (81 %) had a positive CMV PCR test and 3 (19 %) a negative PCR test. All blood samples from 16 control infants without congenital CMV infection (negative virus <b>isolation</b> <b>test</b> in urine sampled within 1 week of age) were CMV PCR-negative. When 31 samples on filter papers stored above or below the samples of the infected infants were tested, 6 (19 %) had a weak reactivity. This suggests that CMV DNA can be transferred from one filter paper to another during storage. We conclude that PCR performed on dried blood stored on filter paper is a useful method in the retrospective diagnostics of congenital CMV infection. Consideration must be given, however, to the possibility of transfer of CMV DNA from blood samples stored nearby...|$|R
