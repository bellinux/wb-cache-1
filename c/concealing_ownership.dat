5000|$|Adamson {{was given}} a reduced {{sentence}} because of his cooperation, and {{was released from prison}} in 1996. [...] He remained in the federal witness protection program (in which he had been placed in 1990 while he was still in prison), and died in an undisclosed location in 2002 at the age of 58.Among the last words that Bolles mentioned was [...] "Emprise". Emprise (later called Sportservice and now called Delaware North) was a privately owned company that operated various dog and horse racing tracks and is a major food vendor for sports arenas. In 1972, the House Select Committee on Crime held hearings concerning Emprise’s connections with organized crime figures. Around this time, Emprise and six individuals were convicted of <b>concealing</b> <b>ownership</b> of the Frontier Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. As a result of the conviction, Emprise's dog racing operations in Arizona were placed under the legal authority of a trustee appointed by the Arizona State Racing Commission. Bolles was investigating Emprise {{at the time of his}} death. However, no connection between Emprise and his death was discovered.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{means of}} {{reliably}} <b>concealing</b> <b>ownership</b> of cloud data without impeding computation over {{the data is}} presented and evaluated. This facilitates information privacy enforcement in cloud environments by withholding data ownership information from cloud nodes that compute using the data. As a result, nodes that have access to private data in unencrypted form do not know who owns it, what role their computations play in the larger computational task, or to whom their computation results are ultimately delivered. To provide this data ownership privacy, the cloud’s distributed computing resources are leveraged to implement an anonymizing circuit based on Tor, through which users submit private data and jobs. A tunable parameter k controls a trade-off between the degree of anonymity and the computational overhead imposed by the system. Anonymous authentication based on publickey cryptography safely links jobs and data to customers for billing purposes without revealing these associations to untrusted computation nodes. Simulation results demonstrate the potency of the system in presence of attackers. Keywords-anonymity; authentication; cloud computing; information security; privacy; Tor I...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to present an {{approach}} to regulating market manipulation. Market manipulation is a form of market abuse; e g spreading false information on the market, entering both a buy and a sell order for the same security at the same price, or <b>concealing</b> <b>ownership</b> when disclosure is required by law. Market manipulation constitutes together with insider dealing what is regulated as prohibited market behavior. As the financial markets are of central importance to our economic system, finding apt regulation thereof is crucial. Market abuse is one of the greatest threats to the well-being of the financial markets. The question regarding market manipulation regulation is how to find a line between harmful trading and strategic trading. The US and EU market manipulation regimes will be described, compared and analysed from a market efficiency perspective. The article results in proposing three principles for approaching the design of market manipulation regulation, namely; 1) the regulation should secure the market functions and enabling the enhancing of investor confidence and market efficiency, 2) the prohibitions should be action-specific and not comprehensively sorted, and 3) the consumer perspective should not be the leading motive for legislation in this field...|$|E

This solution was accepted and as a result large sums were transferred abroad to companies ostensibly owned by Onassis.

40|$|The use {{of equity}} {{derivatives}} to <b>conceal</b> economic <b>ownership</b> of shares (“hidden ownership”) is increasingly drawing {{attention from the}} financial community, as is the exercise of voting power without corresponding economic interest (“empty voting”). Market participants and commentators have called for expansion of ownership disclosure rules, and policymakers {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic are now contemplating how to respond. Yet, in order to design appropriate responses it is key to understand why we have ownership disclosure rules in the first place. This understanding currently appears to be lacking, which may explain why we observe divergent approaches between countries. The case for mandatory ownership disclosure has also received remarkably little attention in the literature, which has focused almost exclusively on mandatory issuer disclosure. Perhaps this is because most people assume that ownership disclosure is a good thing. But why is such information important, and to whom? This paper aims to answer these fundamental questions, using the European disclosure regime as an example. First, the paper identifies two main objectives of ownership disclosure: improving market efficiency and corporate governance. Next, the paper explores the various mechanisms through which ownership disclosure performs these tasks. This sets the stage for an analysis of hidden ownership and empty voting that demonstrates why these phenomena are so problematic. ...|$|R

Demographic variables such as class standing (students), current rank (faculty), gender, political affiliation and political ideology were used as control variables and to help describe the sample of the study.

It subsequently emerged that Tevez's economic rights were owned by Media Sports Investments (MSI) and a second company, Just Sports Inc.,{2} while Mascherano was jointly owned by Global Soccer Agencies and Mystere Services Ltd. All four companies were represented by Kia Joorabchian and the deal was brokered by MSI, whose president Joorabchian had been until June 2006.Once Scudamore and the Premier League became aware of these allegations an independent commission was formed to look at whether rules had been broken and, due to irregularities in the player's contracts, and it being clear that West ham United officials had lied to the Premier League, West Ham were eventually fined a record £5.5 million.

40|$|Increased {{automobile}} {{ownership and}} use in China {{over the last}} two decades has increased energy consumption, worsened air pollution, and exacerbated congestion. However, the countrywide growth in car <b>ownership</b> <b>conceals</b> great variation among cities. For example, Shanghai and Beijing each had about 2 million motor vehicles in 2004, but by 2010, Beijing had 4. 8 million motor vehicles whereas Shanghai had only 3. 1 million. Among the factors contributing to this divergence is Shanghai’s vehicle control policy, which uses monthly license auctions to limit the number of new cars. The policy appears to be effective: in addition to dampening growth in car ownership, it generates annual revenues up to 5 billion CNY (800 million USD). But, despite these apparent successes, the degree to which the public accepts this policy is unknown. This study surveys 524 employees at nine Shanghai companies to investigate the policy acceptance of Shanghai’s license auction by the working population, and the factors that contribute to that acceptance: Perceived policy effectiveness, affordability, equity concerns, and implementation. Respondents perceive the policy to be effective, but are moderately negative towards the policy nonetheless. However, they expect that others accept the policy more than they do. Respondents also hold consistently negative perceptions about the affordability of the license, the effects on equity, and the implementation process. Revenue usage is not seen as transparent, which is exacerbated by a perception that government vehicles enjoy advantages in obtaining a license, issues with the bidding process and technology, and difficulties in obtaining information about the auction policy. Nevertheless, respondents believe that license auctions and congestion charges are more effective and acceptable than parking charges and fuel taxes. To improve public acceptability of the policy, we make five recommendations: Transparency in revenue usage; transparency in government vehicle licensing and use, categorizing licenses by vehicle type, implementation and technology improvements to increase bidding convenience, and policies that restrict vehicle usage in congested locations...|$|R
