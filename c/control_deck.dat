To reduce consumer confusion, symbols on the games' packaging clearly indicated the genre of the game. A 'seal of quality' was printed on all licensed game and accessory packaging. The initial seal stated, [...] "This seal is your assurance that Nintendo has approved and guaranteed the quality of this product".

5000|$|Shouta Yasooka {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as being a talented deck-builder. [...] He is known to favor blue-based <b>control</b> <b>decks,</b> and decks designed by him are sometimes referred to as 'Yaso-Control' or 'Yaso-Con' decks. Yasooka is also known for his fast and technical play style, an aspect of his game that is considered particularly impressive given his preference for <b>control</b> <b>decks</b> that require lots of decision making. In January 2012, Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa named Yasooka as the main player he would most like to add to Team ChannelFireball. [...] Paulo stated [...] "...he always comes up with the craziest deck ideas and they all seem very bad, but he always does well and is insanely good, so I would like to see how he thinks".|$|R
5000|$|Answering threats at {{a reduced}} cost. Given the opportunity, <b>Control</b> <b>decks</b> can gain card {{advantage}} by answering multiple threats with one spell ("clearing"/"wiping" [...] the board), stopping expensive threats with cheaper spells, and drawing multiple cards or forcing the opponent to discard multiple cards with one spell.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid game, control decks try {{to trade}} cards {{advantageously}} against their opponent. Because {{this is where}} midrange decks, or decks that excel in the mid game, are at their best, the <b>control</b> <b>deck</b> needs to answer many threats at once using [...] "board sweeper" [...] cards such as [...] to avoid falling behind due to the efficiency and raw power of the cards midrange decks have. This is also where the <b>control</b> <b>deck</b> focuses on stabilizing the game by answering every threat presented against it {{to take control of}} the game. Unlike the early game however, because the <b>control</b> <b>deck</b> has access to more mana, the <b>control</b> <b>deck</b> attempts to gain card advantage while trading cards with the opponent. While the <b>control</b> <b>deck</b> is happy [...] "one-for-one"-ing in the early game, it concentrates on [...] "x-for-one"-ing in the mid game where x is anything more than one, generally using board sweepers.|$|E

5000|$|Aggro-control is {{a hybrid}} {{archetype}} that contains both aggressive creatures and <b>control</b> elements. These <b>decks</b> attempt to deploy quick threats while protecting them with light permission and disruption {{long enough to}} win. These are frequently referred to as [...] "tempo" [...] strategies, as they are built {{with a sense of}} timing. Tempo players look to control the game early and take advantage of a strong board state. Where purely <b>control</b> <b>decks</b> look to out class players with more quality in the later stages of the game, tempo looks to keep opponents off balance from the very start.|$|R
5000|$|Permission is {{the act of}} {{threatening}} [...] or any card with a similar effect. It is known as permission because an opponent playing against a <b>control</b> <b>deck</b> full of counterspells feels as {{if he or she}} needs to ask for permission to play any spell. The reason why having permission is powerful is because in a stalled board state, the control player can counter specific opponent threats that will have a large effect on the game. Furthermore, having permission often leads to gaining tempo. A <b>control</b> <b>deck</b> would gain tempo when casting a counterspell on an opposing spell that has a high cost such as [...] While neither player gets ahead in card advantage because it is a one-for-one trade, the <b>control</b> <b>deck</b> gains tempo because he or she only needs to spend two mana for the opponent's seven. The <b>control</b> <b>deck</b> can now use this leftover mana casting something else while the opponent is out of resources for that turn.|$|E
5000|$|The {{end game}} {{is where the}} <b>control</b> <b>deck</b> is most powerful. Using cards that gain card {{advantage}} such as , combined with the card advantage gained during the midgame, the <b>control</b> <b>deck</b> {{should have access to}} many more cards compared to other decks. Permission cards such as [...] are used to prevent the opponent from casting more threats and/or to lock them out of the game.|$|E

5000|$|A typical {{midrange}} deck has {{an early}} game plan of mana ramp and control, but begins to play threats once it reaches {{four to six}} mana. A midrange deck will often seek to play a reactive, attrition-based game against aggro decks and a more proactive, tempo-based game against <b>control</b> <b>decks.</b> Colloquially, this {{is referred to as}} [...] "going bigger" [...] than aggro and [...] "getting in under" [...] control.|$|R

50|$|The first {{successful}} <b>control</b> <b>deck,</b> known as Angel Stasis, won the 1994 Magic World Championships. The deck {{can be classified}} under a resource denial or prison deck. Angel Stasis is {{a great example of}} a powerful <b>control</b> <b>deck</b> because it involves card advantage, resource denial, and inevitability. The deck can destroy opponent threats using Wrath of God or Swords to Plowshares, deny resources using Stasis or Armageddon, and gain card advantage through Ancestral Recall or Timetwister. It nullifies opponent threats using Moat and eventually wins the game with Serra Angel.|$|E

5000|$|Each {{of these}} 4 {{categories}} would ideally occupy around 25% {{of a given}} metagame. In Hill's definition, Aggro refers most specifically to the fastest creature decks built to punish slow starts, ponderous <b>Control</b> <b>decks,</b> and aggressive decks who've substituted out damage for disruption. Midrange decks in this definition are slower creature-based decks who trump the speed of fast aggro with better quality from their somewhat more expensive spells. (Both of these would likely be considered [...] "Aggro" [...] in the traditional definition.) [...] "Ramp" [...] and [...] "Combo" [...] are conceptually similar as noted above; while the combo deck might seek {{to set up a}} combination of 2 or 3 cards for a powerful, game-changing effect, the ramp deck instead focuses on building mana as fast as possible and then casting game-changing yet expensive spells, or taking advantage of certain interactions that require a large manabase. A midrange deck often doesn't have the sheer speed to stop ramp or combo from either casting a huge spell or [...] "going off" [...] with the combo. <b>Control</b> <b>decks</b> can counter or otherwise answer the single big threat ramp decks and combo decks provide while winning the long game. Similarly, [...] "disruptive aggro" [...] (equivalent to Aggro-Control in the classic archetypes above) can also stop the single threat Combo and Ramp offer while focusing on winning faster. These rules can change however as blocks cycle and meta shifts.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the early}} game, or [...] "development stage", the <b>control</b> <b>deck</b> {{attempts}} to stay alive. Because {{of the many}} high cost spells that control decks tend to use, the early game is where control decks are weakest. This is where aggressive decks shine, and because control decks are weak to aggression, it concentrates on staying alive and getting to the mid game. By trading cards [...] "one-for-one" [...] with their opponent, using cards such as , the <b>control</b> <b>deck</b> focuses on removing threats until it has access to enough mana to destroy all of its opponent's threats.|$|E
