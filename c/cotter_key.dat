50|$|A split pin, {{also known}} in the United States as a cotter pin or <b>cotter</b> <b>key,</b> is a metal {{fastener}} with two tines that are bent during installation, similar to a staple or rivet. Typically made of thick wire with a half-circular cross section, split pins come in multiple sizes and types.|$|E
50|$|Beyond the {{expected}} and usual depth charging after attacks on ships, there were close escapes. Once, a Japanese airplane dropped 3 bombs {{directly on the}} Silversides. The sub survived; although during escape, it went into a hard dive with bow planes jammed, exceeding its design depth. At the last moment, Exec Davenport removed a <b>cotter</b> <b>key,</b> enabling the sub to level off to avoid being crushed. On another occasion, a torpedo, half stuck in the firing chamber required re-firing. If unsuccessfully re-fired, it could have sunk the sub. Another time, Davenport had to wrestle a pistol from a drunken gunner's mate who {{felt that he had}} been robbed in a dice game. The sailor was removed from the sub in a straitjacket.|$|E
