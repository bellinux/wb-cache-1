40|$|Fusarium wilt of cotton, {{caused by}} the fungus Fusarium oxysporum Schlechtend. f. sp. vasinfectum (Atk.) Snyd. & Hans, was first {{identified}} in 1892 in cotton growing in sandy acid soils in Alabama (8). Although the disease was soon discovered in other major <b>cotton-producing</b> <b>areas,</b> it did not become global {{until the end of}} the next century. After its original discovery, Fusarium wilt of cotton was reported in Egypt (1902) (30), India (1908) (60), Tanzania (1954) (110), California (1959) (33), Sudan (1960) (44), Israel (1970) (27), Brazil (1978) (5), China (1981) (17), and Australia (1993) (56). In addition to a worldwide distribution, Fusarium wilt occurs in all four of the domesticated cottons, Gossypium arboretum L., G. barbadense L., G. herbaceum L., and G. hirsutum L. (4, 30). Disease losses in cotton are highly variable within a country or region. In severely infested fields planted with susceptible cultivars, yield losses can be high. In California, complete crop losses in individual fields have been observed (R. M. Davis, unpublished). Disease loss estimates prepared by the National Cotton Disease Council indicate losses of over 109, 000 bales (227 kg or 500 lb) in the United States in 2004 (12) ...|$|R
40|$|The cotton {{bollworm}} Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) {{is one of}} the most damaging cotton pests worldwide. In China, control of this pest has been dependent on transgenic cotton producing a single Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein Cry 1 Ac since 1997. A small, but significant, increase in H. armigera resistance to Cry 1 Ac was detected in field populations from Northern China. Since Vip 3 Aa has a different structure and mode of action than Cry proteins, Bt cotton pyramids containing Vip 3 Aa are considered as ideal successors of Cry 1 Ac cotton in China. In this study, baseline susceptibility of H. armigera to Vip 3 Aa was evaluated in geographic field populations collected in 2014 from major <b>cotton-producing</b> <b>areas</b> of China. The LC 50 values of 12 field populations ranged from 0. 053 to 1. 311 μg/cm 2, representing a 25 -fold range of natural variation among populations. It is also demonstrated that four laboratory strains of H. armigera with high levels of resistance to Cry 1 Ac or Cry 2 Ab have no cross-resistance to Vip 3 Aa protein. The baseline susceptibility data established here will serve as a comparative reference for detection of field-evolved resistance to Vip 3 Aa in H. armigera after future deployment of Bt cotton pyramids in China...|$|R
40|$|Nineteen {{soil samples}} were {{obtained}} from different <b>cotton-producing</b> <b>areas</b> in Egypt. The geographic distribution of these samples was as follows: 1 (5. 26 %) from Minufiya; 4 (21. 05 %) from Kafr El-Sheikh; 2 (10. 53 %) from Minya; 3 (15. 79 %) from Gharbiya; 7 (36. 84 %) from Sharqiya; and 2 (10. 53 %) from Faiyum. Clay soil (84. 21 %) was the predominant type in the samples. Twenty-two physical and chemical parameters were measured in the 19 samples. Data for seedling disease variables (postmergence damping-off and dry weight) and edaphic factors were entered into a computerized stepwise multiple regression analysis. Using the predictors supplied by stepwise regression, two models were constructed. These models showed that edaphic factors accounted for 71. 03 and 93. 13 % of the total variation in postemergence damping-off and dry weight, respectively, in models. From stepwise regression analysis, {{it was concluded that}} high soil saturation percent, high Ca++ content, low SO 4 = content, and high Mg++ content were associated with high postemergence damping-off. The present study also showed that high saturation percent, low potassium content, low calcium carbonate content, low Mg++ content, high coarse sand content, and high phosphorus content were associated with an increase in the dry weight of seedlings.

40|$|The {{hydrology}} of the Aral Sea Basin {{during the}} past few decades has been largely determined by the decision to develop irrigated agriculture on a large scale to produce cotton for export in the 1960 s. The irrigated area has grown to 8 million hectares, using practically the entire available flow of the two main rivers, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya. Almost two decades after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the five states of the Aral Sea Basin face the challenge of restoring a sustainable equilibrium while offering development opportunities for an increasing population. Sustainable water management is thus an imperative that will require coordinated political action of all the states involved. The Soviet Union established its <b>cotton-producing</b> <b>areas</b> in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Today, while cotton remains relatively important, cereal production to reduce imports has become a priority in all four nations. The cotton crop area has decreased over the past ten years, while that of winter wheat – the main grain crop – has doubled. At 39 per cent of the total (blue and green) water consumption in agriculture, wheat is the largest water-consuming crop in the five basin states, followed by cotton at 33 per cent. The present study analyses the water footprint of Central Asian cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) production, differentiating between the green and blue components, in order to know how the scarce water resources in the region are apparently allocated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{hypothesis}} that migratory birds accumulate persistent organochlorine pesticides (POPs) {{during the winter}} in Latin America has been prevalent for many years, particularly since 1, 1, 1 -trichloro- 2, 2 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT) was banned in the United States in 1972. It {{has been suggested that}} peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), black-crowned night herons (Nycticorax nycticorax), white-faced ibises (Plegadis chihi), various migratory waterfowl and shorebirds, and other avian species accumulate higher concentrations of POPs while on migration or on their wintering grounds in Latin America. Nonetheless, the data obtained thus far are limited, and there is no clear pattern to suggest that such accumulation occurs on a widespread basis. In this review wildlife contaminant studies conducted along the U. S. –Mexico border and throughout Mexico are discussed. The results for the most part seem to indicate that no major accumulation of 2, 2 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dichloroethylene) (DDE), the most persistent organochlorine compound, has occurred or been reported for most parts of Mexico. The majority of the DDE values in birds from Mexico were similar to those reported in birds from the southwestern United States during the same years. More work needs to be done, particularly in those <b>cotton-producing</b> <b>areas</b> of Mexico where DDT was applied heavily in the past (e. g., Chiapas and Michoacan). Because DDT is still used for malaria control and may still be used in agriculture in Chiapas, this state is probably the one where most migrant species would still be at a significant risk of increased accumulation of DDE and DDT.

40|$|During {{the early}} twentieth century American <b>cotton-producing</b> <b>areas</b> rapidly {{expanded}} beyond the 2 ̆ 2 Old South 2 ̆ 2 cotton belt, an area extending from Virginia to East Texas. By the 1920 s farmers had plowed fields and established new cotton centers in western Oklahoma, the High Plains of Texas, and among the large irrigated farms of California, Arizona, and New Mexico. By the 1940 s the dominant areas of American cotton production were California and West Texas.;While historians have examined many aspects of cotton production in the South, the same cannot be said of the western cotton belt. This study profiles the newer cotton farming areas from Central Texas to California and their evolutionary development into the 2 ̆ 2 Cotton West. 2 ̆ 2;Several conditions influenced the establishment and expansion of the Cotton West. Water and irrigation were key ingredients. New settlers in many areas produced relatively little until the federal government built a major irrigation system through the reclamation program; other farmers depended on underground water to sustain their crops.;Central players {{in the development of the}} western cotton industry were the researchers and scientists of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and their partners in state land-grant colleges and agricultural experiment stations. The USDA was particularly eager to establish a new cotton industry in the West [...] -one that would supplement instead of duplicate that of the South. Researchers sought and improved varieties of long-staple and Acala cottons, which they bred to suit each region of the Cotton West.;With appropriate varieties of cotton available to farmers, the march toward mechanization became the next important area of study for farmers and researchers alike. Changes in technology and the available labor force were constant challenges for western cotton producers needing seasonal, sometimes migratory, labor at particular times of the year. Federal immigration policy affected which ethnic groups were available. The shift to mechanical harvesting after World War II marked a significant step toward completing mechanization and shifting the labor needs for cotton growing.

40|$|The {{principle}} behind {{farm machinery}} cooperatives is that farmers club together {{to share the}} cost of buying and maintaining a tractor, trailer or threshing machine. In the South, in particular, {{the high price of}} farm machinery coupled with the small size of plots mean {{that it is hard to}} recoup one s investment. More and more farmers are discovering that the cooperative system offers a way of using equipment to make labour intensive farming jobs easier and more efficient, at a fraction of the normal cost. In Benin, the first two such cooperatives were launched in 1997. Today there are 17 in just one region, Borgou-Alibori, a <b>cotton-producing</b> <b>area</b> in the northeastern part of the country, and demand for more cooperatives is growing. Compared with the classic service offered by private suppliers, these organisations guarantee a greater variety of equipment, ensuring better quality work for the farmers. They also provide access to credit from banks. In an effort to ensure an even more efficient supply and maintenance of farm machinery, the cooperatives of Borgou-Alibori have regrouped under a regional umbrella organisation. A spare parts warehouse and a repair service managed by a specialist mechanic have also been set up. Launched in 2003, this regional grouping is aiming to encourage the mechanisation of agriculture in Benin. The principle behind farm machinery cooperatives is that farmers club together to share the cost of buying and maintaining a tractor, trailer or threshing machine [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Cotton {{production}} is worldwide hampered by infection of various pests and diseases, including plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN). Root-knot nematodes (RKN), in particular Meloidogyne incognita race 4 is the predominant nematode species and race that adversely affects {{the production of}} cotton in South Africa and thus result in substantial yield losses. Management strategies that are frequently used to minimize yield losses in cotton locally are limited to a few registered nematicides {{and to a lesser}} extent, crop rotation. In addition, no resistant cotton cultivars are available that are adapted to local climatic conditions. The main objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficacy of abamectin against PPN, particularly M. incognita race 4, in greenhouse and field trials. The host suitability of four cultivars Delta OPAL®, Nu OPAL®, Nu OPAL RR® and Delta OPAL RR® that were used in the greenhouse trial were concurrently also evaluated against M. incognita race 4. To conduct this study, mature RKN females that were present in roots of tomato (cv. Rodade) and produced egg masses from which eggs and J 2 (used as inoculum source for the greenhouse trial) were identified using Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) -based techniques. The same procedure was followed for females that were present in roots of cotton cultivars that were planted in field trials. With regard to the greenhouse trial, two treatments namely abamectin at a dosage rate of 0. 15 mg a. i. /seed as well as a non-abamectin (untreated control) treatment were used. Approximately 2 500 M. incognita race 4 eggs and J 2 were inoculated per cotton seed at planting for four cultivars (Delta OPAL ®, Nu OPAL®, Nu OPAL RR® and Delta OPAL RR®) that were used. Nematode parameters viz. numbers of eggs and J 2, egg masses and galls per root system as well as egg-laying female (ELF) indices and reproduction (Rf) values were obtained during five sampling intervals. These intervals represented the major growth stages of cotton plants, namely first true leaf, square, flower and boll development as well as when 50 % of the bolls were opening. In addition, root mass (g) and biomass (g) data per cotton plant were also obtained. The trial layout was a randomized complete split-plot design including the two treatments, five sampling intervals and the four cultivars, which were replicated six times. Nematode and plant growth stage data were subjected to a factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatments as factor 1, sampling intervals as factor 2 and cultivars as factor 3. Means were separated by the Tukey Test and degrees of freedom (error) > 18 were always pursued. Nematode data for nematode parameters (dependent variables) were non-linearly regressed on the various sampling intervals (independent variable) using polynomial models (Genstat for Windows), while plant data (dependent variable) were linearly regressed using the sampling intervals (the independent variable). The RKN species and race that was used as inoculum for the greenhouse trial proved to be M. incognita race 4 using the specific sequenced characterized amplified region (SCAR) -polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Although the 0. 15 mg abamectin a. s. /seed treatment resulted in a significant (P ? 0. 05) reduction in M. incognita race 4 population levels in roots of the four cultivars, these levels were still relatively high. Significant differences (P ? 0. 05) were also evident among the sampling intervals for both the abamectin and non-abamectin treatments with regard to all nematode and plant growth parameters. Further, the four cultivars were identified as susceptible hosts to this RKN species and race and generally had similar non-linear regression lines for the non-abamectin treatment in terms of M. incognita race 4 -population development during the duration of the trial. These cultivars did, however, differ significantly (P ? 0. 05) from each other in terms of particularly the eggs and J 2 /root system only for the abamectin treatment when data were pooled for the five sampling intervals. Cultivar Nu OPAL® maintained significant (P ? 0. 05) higher egg and J 2 numbers/root system than those maintained by the other three cultivars. This cultivar was, however, still classified as being highly susceptible (like the other three cultivars) to M. incognita race 4 using Rf values. For the latter as well as other nematode parameters, namely egg mass and gall numbers/root system as well as ELF indices significant (P ? 0. 05) differences were only evident between the two treatments and the five sampling intervals, but not for the cultivars. With regard to interaction data those that were significant (P ? 0. 05) between the two treatments and five sampling intervals for all the nematode and plant parameters, were regarded as the most important. This indicated that the treatments reacted differently during these intervals for all parameters measured. Since this trial was conducted in a greenhouse under controlled conditions, nematode and plant growth data obtained should be verified in field trials throughout the <b>cotton-producing</b> <b>areas</b> of South Africa under natural occurring environmental conditions. Only then can final conclusions be made in this regard. For evaluation and verification of the efficacy of abamectin as a seed treatment in reducing PPN populations particularly M. incognita race 4, field trials were conducted at five sites where cotton was commercially grown during the 2005 / 2006 and 2006 / 2007 growing seasons. Four trials were conducted at three sites that are located in commercially-grown cotton fields in the Marble Hall area (Limpopo Province), while the other trial was done in the Vaalharts area near Jan Kempdorp (Northern Cape Province). For abamectin, two dosage treatments, namely 0. 15 mg a. s. /seed and 0. 30 mg a. s. /seed were used in all field trials. Standard treatments included were the classical nematicides aldicarb and fenamiphos that are registered on cotton in South Africa. An untreated control as well as a thiamethoxam 0. 3 mg a. s. /seed treatment were also included for the 2005 / 2006 trials. In addition to these treatments, a seventh treatment containing abamectin 0. 15 mg a. s. /seed + thiamethoxam 0. 3 mg a. s. /seed was included during the 2006 / 2007 season. Cotton seed used to plant trials during the 2005 / 2006 season were those for cultivar Nu OPAL®, while Nu OPAL RR® was used during the 2006 / 2007 season. Trial layouts for all trials constituted a randomized complete block design with nine and six replicates during the 2005 / 2006 and 2006 / 2007 growing seasons, respectively. Both root and soil samples were taken for nematode extraction, counts and identification purposes from the outer two rows of each plot at 42 as well as 84 days after planting (DAP), except when excessive rainfall occurred. Nematode and yield data for all trials were subjected to analyses of variance (ANOVA). For yield estimation, cotton lint was also harvested for all trials, weighed and subjected to ANOVAS. Meloidogyne incognita race 4 has been identified as the predominant PPN species and race being present at all trial sites, while low population levels of individuals from the Hoplolaimidae, Criconema spp., Pratylenchus spp. and Paratrichodorus spp. were also present. The standard nematicide treatments aldicarb and fenamiphos generally resulted in the lowest number of M. incognita race 4 eggs and J 2 /root system in all trials and differed significantly from those for the untreated control treatments for three trials. The 0. 15 mg abamectin dosage treatment in particular did generally not differ significantly (P ? 0. 05) from the untreated control treatments nor from the standard nematicide and the thiamethoxam 0. 3 mg treatment as well as for the abamectin 0. 15 mg a. s. /seed + thiamethoxam 0. 3 mg treatment during sampling interval one for two of the trials and during sampling intervals one and two for the other. Yield for the abamectin 0. 15 mg a. s. /seed treatment was significantly (P ? 0. 05) higher than that of the untreated control only for Trial A. In terms of the cost-effectiveness, the estimated cost of the 0. 15 mg abamectin a. s. /seed treatment was calculated to be substantially lower than those for the two standard nematicide treatments for the latter trial. This scenario poses a potential benefit for producers when this abamectin dosage will be used. Although the 0. 15 mg abamectin dosage treatment showed potential to reduce population levels of M. incognita race 4 during this study, data varied between trials and seasons for the field trials. It must, however, be emphasised that since M. incognita race 4 populations in roots of abamectin-treated cotton plants were comparable to those for the standard nematicides as well as those of the untreated controls, additional management strategies should be used in combination with the abamectin treatment. It further accentuates that abamectin should preferably be used only where population levels of M. incognita race 4 are not particularly high. Master...|$|R
