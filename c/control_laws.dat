40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{rendezvous}} control of multiple mobile robots. We propose a <b>control</b> <b>law</b> that merely requires each robot {{to measure the}} relative bearings of their neighbors in their local coordinate frames. Distance measurement or relative position estimation is not required. In theory, the proposed <b>control</b> <b>law</b> verifies that distance information is redundant in rendezvous control tasks though the objective of rendezvous is to decrease the inter-robot distances. In practice, the <b>control</b> <b>law</b> provides a simple solution to vision-based rendezvous tasks where bearings can be measured by visual sensing. Moreover, we generalize the proposed <b>control</b> <b>law</b> by introducing an additional heading vector into the <b>control</b> <b>law.</b> This heading vector may preserve the system convergence and, in the meantime, provides great flexibility to adapt the <b>control</b> <b>law</b> for nonholonomic robot models or obstacle avoidance. ...|$|R
