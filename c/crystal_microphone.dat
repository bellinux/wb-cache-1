2500|$|A <b>crystal</b> <b>{{microphone}}</b> or piezo microphone {{uses the}} phenomenon of piezoelectricity—the ability of some materials to produce a voltage when subjected to pressure—to convert vibrations into an electrical signal. An {{example of this is}} potassium sodium tartrate, which is a piezoelectric crystal that works as a transducer, both as a microphone and as a slimline loudspeaker component. Crystal microphones were once commonly supplied with vacuum tube (valve) equipment, such as domestic tape recorders. [...] Their high output impedance matched the high input impedance (typically about 10megohms) of the vacuum tube input stage well. They were difficult to match to early transistor equipment, and were quickly supplanted by dynamic microphones for a time, and later small electret condenser devices. The high impedance of the <b>crystal</b> <b>microphone</b> made it very susceptible to handling noise, both from the microphone itself and from the connecting cable.|$|E

40|$|A new compact {{multiband}} PIFA (Planar Inverted-F Antenna) for {{mobile handset}} is proposed in this article. The proposed PIFA has a simple geometry with four slots integrated in the radiating patch and ground plane. The PIFA occupies a small volume of 51 × 14 × 7. 2 [*]mm 3 and {{is placed on}} the top portion of mobile phone. The optimized PIFA is worked in the 790 [*]MHz band (737 – 831 [*]MHz), the 1870 [*]MHz band (1794 – 1977 [*]MHz), the 2550 [*]MHz band (2507 – 2615 [*]MHz), and the 3400 [*]MHz band (3341 – 3545 [*]MHz), to cover LTE 700, LTE 800, DCS 1800, PCS 1900, LTE 1800, LTE 1900, LTE 2500, and WIMAX 3400 bands. Each of the four operating bands can be controlled independently by the variation of a single parameter of the proposed design, with a wide control range. An omnidirectional radiation pattern to each resonant frequency is obtained with a maximum gain of 2. 15 [*]dBi at 790 [*]MHz, 3. 99 [*]dBi at 1870 [*]MHz, 4. 57 [*]dBi at 2550 [*]MHz, and 6. 43 [*]dBi at 3400 [*]MHz. The proposed PIFA is studied in the free space and in the presence of other mobile phone components such as the battery, LCD (liquid <b>crystal</b> display), camera, <b>microphone,</b> speaker, buttons, and a plastic housing. The distribution of specific absorption rate for both European and American standards for each operating band and at various distances between the antenna and the human head is also studied...|$|R
40|$|A {{reduction}} in {{the intensity of the}} heart sounds is a familiar sequel to myocardial infarction. Sounds are sometimes described as muffled, weakened, or distant, and when the first sound alone is affected so that both sounds become of equal loudness a characteristic rhythm, sometimes known as "tick-tack rhythm", is produced. This change in inten-sity of the heart sounds has been attributed to alterations in heart rate, lengthening of the P-R interval, or to a lowering of systemic blood pres-sure, but it may be the only physical sign detectable, and not infrequently it is observed for the first time several days after the acute episode when the patient is making an otherwise uneventful recovery. In this paper the results of measurement of in-tensity of the sounds after myocardial infarction are described, and an attempt is made to relate them to other effects of myocardial infarction. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The series included 75 male patients with a history of myocardial infarction within the week preceding the first examination and with confirmatory electrocardiographic abnormalities and transaminase levels. The control group comprised 58 male patients ad-mitted to a general medical ward for reasons other than cardio-respiratory disease. In order to cover a wide range of blood pressure, patients with hypertension but normal electrocardiograms and patients with hypoten-sion due to gastro-intestinal haemorrhage or self poison-ing were included in this group. Apparatus and Procedure. Heart sound intensity was measured by a method similar to that described by Rushmer, Bark, and Ellis (1952).

40|$|The {{length of}} QI time {{duration}} and the amplitude {{of the first}} cardiac tone were measured in 3 cases with coronary sclerosis, and each one with mitral stenosis, with mitral stenoinsufficiency, and with mitral stenoinsufficiency complicated by aortic regurgitation who were all suffered from auricular fibrillation, with special reference to their relation to the hemodynamical values. In 1952, Holldack has pointed out the prolongation of QI time duration in auricular fibrillation, however he has not discussed the influence of underlying disorders, decompensation and respiration upon QI time duration. Under such special considerations, the phonocardiography was performed by means of <b>crystal</b> <b>microphone</b> with the cycle-characteristics, equal to stethoscopic microphone (Luisada) and of amplyfyer with the characteristics slightly descendant from 30 to 1000 c. Besides carotid pulse wave, ecg., respiratory curve and cardiogram were simultaneously recorded. For the measurement of the amplitude, exspiratory and inspiratory phases were devided roughly into the maximal amplitude (peak amplitude) of the first tone and the initial amplitude of the second part were estimated; these data were voluntarily expressed at 20 mmHg, For {{the purpose of the}} cardio-vascular dynamical analysis, Blumberger-Holldack 2 ̆ 7 s and Wezler 2 ̆ 7 s newly improved methods were used. 1. In proportion to the increase in the preceding cardiac cycle length, QI time duration tended roughly to decrease, or to remain unchanged. The length of the preceding cardiac cycle length showed almost constant relationship to QI time duration against QII. The most part of the mean QI time duration in auricular, fibrillation was formed longer than that in normal health. The recompensation tended to show the normalization of prolonged QI time duration. However the QI time duration in one case with compensated pure mitral stenosis remained within the normal limits. 2. As the prolongation of the preceding cycle length, it appeared not seldom to be likely to assure the existence of the definite relationship between peak amplitude and amplitude of {{the second phase of the}} first tone. But this tendency could not necessarily be applied to all of cases. 3. The case with mitral stenosis as above mentioned showed, in the gradual mode, both decrease in amplitude of the second phase and increase in peak amplitude of the first tone as the prolongation of the cardiac cycle length. But such a tendency could not be recognized when mitral insufficiency or aortic regurgitation was complicated. From the mention above, it must be cautiously interpreted the diagnostic meaninig as to both QI time duration and the changes in amplitude, because the events are never simple; this was insisted repeatedly by the quotation of the text examples...|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} newly {{improved}} Wezler 2 ̆ 7 s (1948) and Blumberger-Holldack 2 ̆ 7 s methods used simultaneously, cardio-vascular dynamical values {{with respect to}} the following items were observed : a. the effects of the treatment of various cardio-vascular diseases b. the influence of the anoxic test c. the consequence of the administration of hypotensive drugs and vasoactive substances including norepinephrine. 1. Polygram was obtained as follows, Carotid and femoral arterial pulse waves, E. C. G. Cusually by the second lead), and phonocardiogram were registered on the oscillogram at the same time; the latter was recorded with the <b>crystal</b> <b>microphone</b> of which the characteristics corresponds to that of Luisada 2 ̆ 7 s stethoscopic microphone. 2. The normal range of cardiac dynamical values gained in thirty normal cases show that UFZ (2 ̆ 2 Umformungszeit 2 ̆ 2) is 34 〜 75 σ, DAZ (2 ̆ 2 Druckanstiegszeit 2 ̆ 2) 13 〜 63 σ, ASZ (2 ̆ 2 Anspannungszeit 2 ̆ 2 84 〜 111 σ, ATZ (2 ̆ 2 Austreibungszeit. 2 ̆ 2) 253 〜 314 σ, ATZ/ASZ 2. 4 〜 3. 6 respectively. 3. According to the recompensation in the cases suffered from mitral valvular diseases, prolonged ASZ and diminished ATZ tend to become normal. In the markedly decompensated aortic regurgitation, ASZ is shorten, ATZ is delayed or remains unchanged. However as the recompensation is advanced, decreased ASZ and increased ATZ/ASZ are apt to return to the normal limits. 4. Among Keith-Wagener 2 ̆ 7 s first and second type of essential hypertension nearly one half of cases shows the prolongation of DAZ and ASZ. In the more severe cases, besides the increase in number of the patients with delayed ASZ there are also found the striking augmentation of the cases with prolonged UFZ, however the patients with delayed ATZ are observed only in a minority of them. In the resistance hypertension (2 ̆ 2 Widerstandshochdruck 2 ̆ 2), according to the progress of the degree in Keith-Wagener 2 ̆ 7 s classification the patients with delayed DAZ, UFZ and ASZ increase in number. The similar tendency can be recognized also in the elasticity hypertension (2 ̆ 2 Elastizitatshochdruck 2 ̆ 2). In the majority of minute volume hypertension (2 ̆ 2 Minutenvolumenhockdruck 2 ̆ 2) there is observed the increase in UFZ, ASZ, and ATZ. The patients with abnormal electrocardiographic or urinary findings have tendency to increase in UFZ, DAZ and ASZ, while those who lack in such symptoms are apt to show the prolongation of ATZ markedly. In the cases classified with the height of blood pressure there exists no uniform mode of changed upon the cardiac dynamical values, however in proportion to the elevated diastolic piessure, UFZ, DAZ and ASZ tend to be lengthend. 5. The intravenous injection of nor-epinephrine shows the cardiac dynamics {{in the sense of the}} pressure reaction (2 ̆ 2 Druckreaktion 2 ̆ 2). 1 -Hydrazinophthalazine exhibits the vascular dynamics meant by 2 ̆ 2 Entspannungstypus (Duesberg et al) 2 ̆ 2, whereas in the cardiac dynamics it denotes diminution in all Blumberger-Holldack 2 ̆ 7 s values. C_ 5 does not display any variation of vascular dynamics in the definite direction, but it develops frequently a tendency to show the pressure reaction cardio-dynamically. Reserpine (Serpasil 2 ̆ 2 Ciba 2 ̆ 2) often exhibits the vascular dynamics in the sense of 2 ̆ 2 Entspannungstypus 2 ̆ 2, whereas it does not denote any conclusive mode of the action cardio-dynamically. Among the hypertensive patients in whom, the chronic application of depressant drugs does not bring the favourable effect clinically, despite of some significant changes in the peripheral dynamics, there can not be recognized any remarkable variation in the cardiac dynamics. Conversely, in the patients with the favourable effects, the pressure-, or the volume-loads disapper cardio-dynamically. 6. In the renal hypertension DAZ and ASZ are prolonged distinctly, moreover, in all cases except for chronic nephritis, ATZ is markedly reduced. These features return to the normal pattern as the recompensation is advanced. 7. One of two patients suffered from chronic cor pulmona 2 ̆ 7 le shows the vascular dynamics meant by 2 ̆ 2 Entspannungstypus 2 ̆ 2, while another case exhibits that in the sense of 2 ̆ 2 Anspannungstypus (Duesbery et al) 2 ̆ 2; cardio-dynamically both patients denote the pressure response. These changes return to normal range, although to the small extent, by means of the adminstration of digitalis, and aminophylline preparates. 8. The most cases with myocardial infarction or hypertensive cardiac disease have a slight tendency to show the pressure response, while the patients suffered from angina pectoris or coronary sclerosis do hardly develop such a fluctuation. 9. Amyl-nitrite affects 2 ̆ 2 entspanned 2 ̆ 2 vasculo-dynamically, whereas it displays 2 ̆ 2 Druckreaktion 2 ̆ 2 cardio-dynamically. Aminophylline or Lacarnol 2 ̆ 2 forte 2 ̆ 2 does not show any fixed direction of the variations cardio-vasculo-dynamically; their mode of effects differ largely from the underlying disorders. Anoxic test is apt to exhibit 2 ̆ 2 Entspannungsreaktion 2 ̆ 2 vasculo-dynamically, however it does not denote any definte mode of the cardio-dynamical variations. 10. In the cases suffered from severe myocardial insufficiency, UFZ DAZ and ASZ are all prolonged, ATZ remains normal or becomes subnormal. Stroke- or minutevolum tends to be reduced...|$|E
