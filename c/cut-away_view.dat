40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a concept for automatic focusing on features within a volumetric data set. The user selects a focus, i. e., object of interest, from {{a set of}} pre-defined features. Our system automatically determines the most expressive view on this feature. A characteristic viewpoint is estimated by a novel information-theoretic framework {{which is based on}} the mutual information measure. Viewpoints change smoothly by switching the focus from one feature to another one. This mechanism is controlled by changes in the importance distribution among features in the volume. The highest importance is assigned to the feature in focus. Apart from viewpoint selection, the focusing mechanism also steers visual emphasis by assigning a visually more prominent representation. To allow a clear view on features that are normally occluded by other parts of the volume, the focusing for example incorporates <b>cut-away</b> <b>views...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{clipping}} planes {{is well known}} in computer graphics and can be used to create <b>cut-away</b> <b>views.</b> But clipping against just analytical defined planes is not always suitable for communicating every aspect of such visualization. For example, in hand-drawn technical illustrations, artists tend to communicate the difference between a cut and a model feature by using non-regular, sketchy cut lines instead of straight ones. To enable this functionality in computer graphics, this paper presents a technique for applying 2. 5 D clip-surfaces in real-time. Therefore, the clip plane equation is extended with an additional offset map, which can be represented by a texture map that contains height values. Clipping is then performed by varying the clip plane equation with respect to such an offset map. Further, a capping technique is proposed that enables the rendering of caps onto the clipped area to convey the impression of solid material. It avoids a re-meshing of a solid polygonal mesh after clipping is performed. Our approach is pixel precise, applicable in real-time, and takes fully advantage of graphics accelerators...|$|R

In those image regions, where an object occludes more important structures it is displayed more sparsely than in those areas where no occlusion occurs. Thus the objects of interest are clearly visible. For each object several representations, i. e., levels of sparseness, are specified. The display of an individual object may incorporate different levels of sparseness. The goal is to emphasize important structures and to maximize the information content in the final image.

40|$|Developing {{techniques}} for automatic computer generated expressive In this thesis several expressive visualization {{techniques for}} volumetric data are presented. The key {{idea is to}} classify the underlying data according to its prominence on the resulting visualization by importance value. The importance property drives the visualization pipeline to emphasize the most prominent features and to suppress the less relevant ones. The suppression can be realized globally, so the whole object is suppressed, or locally. A local modulation generates <b>cut-away</b> and ghosted <b>views</b> because the suppression of less relevant features occurs only on the part where the occlusion of more important features appears. Features within the volumetric data are classified {{according to a new}} dimension denoted as object importance. This property determines which structures should be readily discernible and which structures are less important. Next, for each feature various representations (levels o...|$|R
40|$|In flow visualization, {{integral}} {{surfaces are}} of particular interest {{for their ability to}} describe trajectories of massless particles. In areas of swirling motion, integral surfaces can become very complex and difficult to understand. Taking inspiration from traditional illustration techniques, such as <b>cut-aways</b> and exploded <b>views,</b> we propose a surface analysis tool based on surface splitting and focus+context visualization. Our surface splitting scheme is hierarchical and at every level of the hierarchy the best cut is chosen according to a surface complexity metric. In order to make the interpretation of the resulting pieces straightforward, cuts are always made along isocurves of specific flow attributes. Moreover, a degree of interest can be specified, so that the splitting procedure attempts to unveil the occluded interesting areas. Through practical examples, we show that our approach is able to overcome the lack of understanding originating from structural occlusion.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} importance-driven feature enhancement as {{a technique}} for the automatic generation of <b>cut-away</b> and ghosted <b>views</b> out of volumetric data. The presented focus+context approach removes or suppresses less {{important parts of}} a scene to reveal more important underlying information. However, less important parts are fully visible in those regions, where important visual information is not lost, i. e., more relevant features are not occluded. Features within the volumetric data are first classified {{according to a new}} dimension denoted as object importance. This property determines which structures should be readily discernible and which structures are less important. Next, for each feature various representations (levels of sparseness) from a dense to a sparse depiction are defined. Levels of sparseness define a spectrum of optical properties or rendering styles. The resulting image is generated by ray-casting and combining the intersected features proportional to their importance (importance compositing). The paper includes an extended discussion on several possible schemes for levels of sparseness specification. Furthermore different approaches to importance compositing are treated.

40|$|In Volume Rendering, it is {{difficult}} to simultaneously visualize interior and exterior structures. Several approaches have been developed to solve this problem, such as <b>cut-away</b> or exploded <b>views.</b> Nevertheless, in most cases, those algorithms usually require either a preprocess of the data, or an accurate determination of the region of interest, previous to data inspection. In this paper we present the Virtual Magic Lantern (VML), an interaction tool tailored to facilitate volumetric data inspection. It behaves like a lantern whose virtual illumination cone provides the focal region which is visualized using a secondary transfer function or rendering style. This may be used for simple visual inspection, surgery planning, or injure diagnosis. The VML is a particularly friendly and intuitive interaction tool suitable for an immersive Virtual Reality setup with a large screen, where the user moves a Wanda device, like a lantern pointing to the model. We show that this inspection metaphor can be efficiently and easily adapted to a GPU ray casting volume visualization algorithm. We also present the Virtual Magic Window (VMW) metaphor as an efficient collateral implementation of the VML, that {{can be seen as a}} restricted case where the lantern illuminates following the viewing direction, through a virtual window created as the intersection of the virtual lantern (guided by the Wanda device) and the bounding box of the volume. This approach allows better frame rates because the shader requires almost no modification with respect to the classical volume ray casting. On the other hand, the contextual information is not perceived as well as with the previous method, especially on the boundary of the inspected region. Apart from its main use, our metaphor can also be used to aid in the tedious process of transfer function selection. Postprint (published version...|$|R
