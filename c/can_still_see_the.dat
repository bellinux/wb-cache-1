25|$|In the 18th century, Hellfire Clubs {{sprung up}} in Britain and Ireland. Though {{activities}} varied between the clubs, {{some of them were}} very pagan, and included shrines and sacrifices.

25|$|In some {{versions}} of the story, the hill is Penshaw Hill, that on which the Penshaw Monument now stands, but locally the credit goes to the nearby Worm Hill, in Fatfield.

The statue is still periodically crowned with garlands by modern worshippers. He lived until 1600 and had great influence upon the fate of the Nayaka dynasty until his death.|$|E
25|$|After the Indians left, {{a farmer}} plowed {{much of the}} {{clearing}} at Big Indian Farm. For decades people dug in the burial mounds. But much of the surrounding area, including Little Indian Farm, remains largely as the Indians left it a hundred years ago.

25|$|With the Salon d'Automne of {{that same}} year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent {{as it had been}} at the Indépendants. I {{remember}} this Room 8 in the Grand Palais on the opening day. People were crushed together, shouting, laughing, calling for our heads. And what had we hung? Metzinger his lovely canvas entitled Le Goûter; Léger his sombre Nus dans un Paysage; Le Fauconnier, landscapes done in the Savoie; myself La Chasse and the Portrait de Jacques Nayral. How distant it all seems now! But I <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> crowd gathering together in the doors of the room, pushing at those who were already pressed into it, wanting to get in to see for themselves the monsters that we were.|$|E

25|$|Parres el Guarda {{was founded}} {{in the middle of}} the 19th century as a rail town, when the line {{connecting}} Mexico City and Cuernavaca was built. Parres was an important stop for both passengers and freight along this line. The community was founded on lands that belonged to the Juan de las Fuentes Parres Hacienda, giving the town its name. Today, one <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> ruins of the old hacienda main house. Its economy currently is based on the cultivation of animal feed and is an important producer of this product. It is also known for the sheep meat which is most often used in the preparation of barbacoa in the Mexico City area. Its patron saint is the Virgin of Guadalupe, celebrated on 12 December traditionally with the Chinelos dance, fireworks, cockfights and more.|$|E
500|$|When {{she retired}} from the Abbey board, Lady Gregory {{returned}} to live in Galway, although she continued to visit Dublin regularly. The house and demesne at Coole Park had been sold to the Irish Forestry Commission in 1927, with Lady Gregory retaining life tenancy. Her Galway home had long been {{a focal point for}} the writers associated with the Irish Literary Revival, and this continued after her retirement. On a tree in what were the grounds of the house, one <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> carved initials of Synge, Æ, Yeats and his artist brother Jack, George Moore, Seán O'Casey, George Bernard Shaw, Katharine Tynan and Violet Martin. Yeats wrote five poems about, or set in, the house and grounds: [...] "The Wild Swans at Coole", [...] "I walked among the seven woods of Coole", [...] "In the Seven Woods", [...] "Coole Park, 1929" [...] and [...] "Coole Park and Ballylee, 1931".|$|E
500|$|Mercedes-Benz withdrew {{entirely from}} motor racing {{at the start}} of 1932 {{in the face of the}} {{economic}} crisis, so Caracciola moved to Alfa Romeo with a promise to return to Mercedes if they resumed racing. His contract stipulated he would begin racing for the Italian team as a semi-independent. Caracciola later wrote that the Alfa Romeo manager was defensive when he questioned him about this clause; Caracciola believed it was because the firm's Italian drivers did not believe he could change from the huge Mercedes cars to the much smaller Alfa Romeos. His first race for his new team was at the Mille Miglia; he led early in the race, but retired when a valve connection broke. Caracciola later wrote, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> expression on [...] Campari's face when I arrived back at the factory. He smiled to himself as if to say, Well, didn't I tell you that one wasn't going to make it?" ...|$|E

500|$|Alongside his {{intellectual}} pursuits Cardus played and followed cricket. As {{a small boy}} {{he had begun to}} visit Old Trafford Cricket Ground to watch Lancashire matches: [...] "The first cricketer I saw was A.C. MacLaren... I <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> swing of MacLaren's bat, the great follow-through finishing high and held there with the body poised". In 1902 he saw the Test match against Australia in which Victor Trumper scored a century before lunch and thereby won a permanent place among Cardus's heroes. Cardus first played cricket on rough waste land close to his home in Rusholme; as he matured he developed as an effective medium-paced off break bowler, and for several seasons from 1908 onwards he played as a weekend professional in Manchester league cricket. [...] "I am not ashamed to confess that I seldom hesitated, as soon as a batsman came to the crease, to let him have a quick one bang in the penis; after which a quick, simple straight one would invariably remove him from the scene".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. It featured an unusual amount of animation glitches because the animation studio in Korea was training {{a new group of}} animators, and this episode was one of their first efforts. Show runner Mike Reiss said he will always remember it as the episode [...] "that came back animated with a thousand mistakes in it and was just a complete and utter mess." [...] Reardon said there was [...] "literally a mistake in every other scene" [...] when the episode came back from Korea. Several scenes had to be re-animated in the United States because of these glitches, but according to Reardon, [...] "you <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> lesser ones that got through, such as line quality problems particularly in the first act." [...] Though it aired in season three, [...] "When Flanders Failed" [...] was produced during the previous season. It was recorded in spring 1991 when the previous season came to an end, and was scheduled to air in autumn that year. The staff therefore had more time to fix the glitches during the summer.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, when Island Records {{approached}} Adé about releasing his material internationally under its Mango Records imprint, the musician {{was already a}} star in his native Nigeria, with his own record label, his own nightclub to host his performances and {{a track record of}} releasing three or four albums a year. When Adé agreed, he was teamed with Martin Meissonnier, a French record producer who advised that the typical long song structures of Nigerian music would not work for Western audiences. Accordingly, Adé divided a number of his Nigerian hits for international release, a task he found unchallenging. He later explained that [...] "In Nigeria, we got used to non-stop recording, about 18 to 20 minutes of music. But over here, the music should be track-by-track for the radio and the dance floor. It's like making a dress. One by one, the different pieces are joined together, but you <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> lines where they meet".|$|E
2500|$|Wray {{was also}} a member {{of one of the most}} famous B-movie units at work during what is now viewed as the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood -- a group whose {{creative}} energy and inventiveness made Lewton's success possible. She spoke about working with the group in a conversation with her daughter many years later, a recollection that shines a clear light on the group's chemistry and skill, and the special place it held in Wray's heart:She rarely spoke about her early career or the McCarthy era. [...] But when I asked once what it was like working with Lewton, she smiled -- thought about it for a long moment -- and then told me about the night the group spent figuring out how to build to the first murder in The Leopard Man. [...] The scene she had written was pure psychological terror, trading on very basic fears -- of the dark, of being punished unjustly, locked out of your own home, abandoned by people you trust -- and at the same time it sets up the mystery that is the premise of the entire film. [...] They were under pressure to get this sequence right, and almost everyone was there that night. The session went well into the small hours of the morning, was filled with laughter, and included a hilarious riff as one of them experimented with a set of castanets, which turned out to be the key to building the tension and suspense. They worked their way through a dozen different shot sequences before they were satisfied and, listening to her, I had the very strong impression that they would have come up with that same elegant, powerful scene even if they had been working with an A-movie budget and had more time. [...] As Agee so famously observed about Lewton, these were people who understood film and cared about human beings. [...] I <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> smile on her face as she recalled that night. [...] -- Stefani Warren, September 2016 ...|$|E
