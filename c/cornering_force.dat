5|$|Fourth, camber thrust {{contributes}} to the centripetal force necessary to cause the bike to deviate from a straight path, along with <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> due to the slip angle, and can be the largest contributor. Camber thrust {{contributes to}} the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle. When a bike is steered and leaned in the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is greater than that of the rear and so can generate more camber thrust, all else being equal.|$|E
5|$|Tires {{generate}} the lateral forces necessary for steering and balance {{through a combination}} of <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> and camber thrust. Tire inflation pressures have also been found to be important variables in the behavior of a motorcycle at high speeds. Because the front and rear tires can have different slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. Of the two, understeer, in which the front wheel slides more than the rear wheel, is more dangerous since front wheel steering is critical for maintaining balance.|$|E
500|$|In {{order for}} a bike to turn, that is, change its {{direction}} of forward travel, the front wheel must aim approximately in the desired direction, as with any front-wheel steered vehicle. Friction between the wheels and the ground then generates the centripetal acceleration necessary to alter the course from straight ahead as a combination of <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> and camber thrust. The radius of the turn of an upright (not leaning) bike can be roughly approximated, for small steering angles, by: ...|$|E

50|$|Untripped rollovers {{occur when}} <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> destabilize the vehicle. As a vehicle rounds a <b>corner,</b> three <b>forces</b> act on it: tire forces (the {{centripetal}} force), inertial effects (the centrifugal force), and gravity. The <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> from the tire push the vehicle towards {{the center of}} the curve. This force acts at ground level, below the center of mass. The force of inertia acts horizontally through the vehicle's center of mass away from {{the center of the}} turn. These two forces make the vehicle roll towards the outside of the curve. The force of the vehicle's weight acts downward through the center of mass in the opposite direction. When the tire and inertial forces are enough to overcome the force of gravity, the vehicle starts to turn over.|$|R

50|$|<b>Cornering</b> <b>force</b> is {{the lateral}} (i.e. {{parallel}} to the road surface) force produced by a vehicle tyre during cornering. <b>Cornering</b> <b>force</b> coefficients of motorcycle tyres tends to decrease with increased vertical load, increased inflation pressure, and increased temperature.|$|E
50|$|While {{the tread}} element {{moves through the}} contact patch it is {{deflected}} further from the wheel mid-plane.

50|$|<b>Cornering</b> <b>force</b> is {{generated}} by tire slip and is proportional to slip angle at low slip angles. The rate at which <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> builds up is described by relaxation length. Slip angle describes the deformation of the tire contact patch, and this deflection of the contact patch deforms the tire in a fashion akin to a spring.|$|E
50|$|The diagram is {{misleading}} because the reaction force {{would appear to}} be acting in the wrong direction. It is simply a matter of convention to quote positive <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> as acting in the opposite direction to positive tire slip so that calculations are simplified, since a vehicle cornering under the influence of a <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> to the left will generate a tire slip to the right.|$|E
50|$|Short spindle SLAs tend {{to require}} stiffer {{bushings}} at the body, as the braking and <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> are higher. Also {{they tend to}} have poorer kingpin geometry, due to the difficulty of packaging the upper ball joint and the brakes inside the wheel.|$|R
30|$|In {{equilateral}} polygons, the superposed corners {{are independent}} of each other, but they are inscribed in the same circle. However, in natural pores, the cross sections are more irregular, and the complex structure of the polygonal <b>corners</b> <b>forces</b> the fluid distributions to be more complicated.|$|R
50|$|There is {{risk with}} trail braking because {{excessive}} use of the front brake {{can result in a}} loss of grip as the tire's adhesion is split between braking and <b>cornering</b> <b>forces.</b> Effective trail braking requires finesse from the rider, which can be difficult to learn.|$|R

5000|$|As with {{deformation}} of a spring, {{deformation of}} the tire contact patch generates a reaction {{force in the}} tire; the <b>cornering</b> <b>force.</b> Integrating the force generated by every tread element along the contact patch length gives the total <b>cornering</b> <b>force.</b> Although the term, [...] "tread element" [...] is used, the compliance in the tire that leads to this effect is actually a combination of sidewall deflection and deflection of the rubber within the contact patch. The exact ratio of sidewall compliance to tread compliance {{is a factor in}} tire construction and inflation pressure.|$|E

For a free-rolling wheel this slip angle results in a force parallel to the axle and the component of the force perpendicular to the wheel's direction of travel is the <b>cornering</b> <b>force.</b> This <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> increases approximately linearly for the first few degrees of slip angle, then increases non-linearly to a maximum before beginning to decrease.|$|E

50|$|Wheels {{and tires}} are {{much smaller than}} those used on a normal car. Rims are made of {{magnesium}} alloy, aluminum, or composite materials. Tires can support <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> in excess of 2 g (20 m/s²), depending on chassis, engine, and motor setup.
