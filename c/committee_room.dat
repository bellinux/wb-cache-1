5|$|In {{addition}} to the General Assembly Hall, the Parliament also used buildings rented from the City of Edinburgh Council. The former administrative building of Lothian Regional Council on George IV Bridge {{was used for the}} MSP's offices. Following the move to Holyrood in 2004 this building was demolished. The former Midlothian County Buildings facing Parliament Square, High Street and George IV Bridge in Edinburgh (originally built as the headquarters of the pre-1975 Midlothian County Council) housed the Parliament's visitors' centre and shop, whilst the main hall was used as the Parliament's principal <b>committee</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{a two-year}} project {{to rebuild the}} {{property}} above the shops on Ship Street was completed. As part of the work, {{carried out by the}} architects Maguire & Co., the bottom floor was converted from rooms occupied by students and fellows into a new Junior Common Room (JCR), to replace the common room in the second quadrangle, which was by then too small to cope with the increased numbers of students. The new JCR, about twice the size of the previous one, can be partitioned into smaller rooms or kept open for large meetings; there is also a kitchen, a student <b>committee</b> <b>room</b> and a glazed conservatory extending onto the adjoining terrace. Above the JCR are three floors of new student rooms. The two rooms of the old JCR, each of which contain war memorials, have been converted into seminar and meeting rooms, and are now known as the Harold Wilson Room and the Memorial Room.|$|E
5|$|By 11 May, the {{possibility}} of a deal between the Liberal Democrats and Labour was looking unlikely. Talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats continued, and after concluding {{that he would not be}} able to form a government, Brown announced his resignation that evening. He also resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect. He then left Downing Street with his wife and their children, and drove to Buckingham Palace where he tendered his resignation to the Queen and advised her to call for David Cameron. Cameron became Prime Minister one hour after the Queen accepted Brown's resignation, and arrived at Downing Street with his wife, Samantha shortly afterwards. In his first address outside 10 Downing Street, he announced his intention to form a coalition government, the first since the Second World War, with the Liberal Democrats. Cameron appointed Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister. Cameron met with his MPs in the <b>Committee</b> <b>Room</b> of the House of Commons at 10.00pm, where he was greeted with cheering that could be heard from the central hall of the Commons.|$|E

(Although it {{is not part of}} the main hall, the room is usually spoken of as such.) The seating is laid out in a U-shape, in contrast with the main Chamber, in which the benches are placed opposite each other. This pattern is meant to reflect the non-partisan nature of the debates held in Westminster Hall.|$|E

Directly opposite was the door to another caucus room, where leader of the opposition, Thomas Mulcair, and New Democratic Party MPs were gathered. (The Liberals, as the third party, were holding their caucus meeting in a chamber downstairs.) During the shooting, one bullet penetrated the outer doors to the NDP caucus room. Inside their room, NDP MPs dove for cover. Across the hall, Harper was hidden in a closet while Conservative MPs made a barricade at the doors, grabbing flagpoles to use as rudimentary spears.|$|E

The Members' Hall has access to the House of Representatives and the Senate buildings to the left and right of the main entrance to the halls respectively. Public access to the visitors' galleries and the Main <b>Committee</b> <b>Room</b> is via an upper level reached by impressive marble staircases ascending from the entrance foyer.

500|$|The {{break with}} Nasser {{weakened}} the original {{leaders of the}} Ba'ath Party, which in turn gave the Military <b>Committee</b> <b>room</b> to expand. After taking power, the Military Committee looked for theoretical guidance, but {{instead of going to}} Aflaq to solve problems (which was usual before), they contacted the party's Marxist faction led by Hammud al-Shufi. At the Syrian Ba'athist Regional Congress, the Military Committee [...] "proved" [...] that it was rebelling equally against Aflaq and the traditional leadership, as against their moderate social and economic policies. The Military Committee was bent on removing Aflaq from a position of power, believing that he had become old and frail.|$|E
500|$|Although Bryan {{had decided}} on a {{strategy}} to gain the nomination—to give a speech which would make him the logical candidate {{in the eyes of}} delegates—he faced obstacles along the way. For one thing, he began the 1896 convention without any official status—the Democratic National Committee, which made the initial determination of which delegations would be seated, had chosen the pro-gold Nebraskans to represent their state. Bryan had been waiting outside the <b>committee</b> <b>room</b> when his rivals were seated by a 27–23 vote; contemporary accounts state he was [...] "somewhat surprised" [...] at the result. The DNC's action could be reversed, but not until the convention's credentials committee reported.

Britt informed a press conference, [...] "Harvey Milk's people do not have anything to apologize for. Now the society {{is going to have to}} deal with us not as nice little fairies who have hairdressing salons, but as people capable of violence. We're not going to put up with Dan Whites anymore." [...] Reporters were surprised that a public official would condone the violent acts of the previous night, expecting an apology from Britt. Subsequent attempts to find a gay leader who would give an apologetic statement proved unsuccessful.|$|E

50|$|The Cannon Building was {{occupied}} during the 60th Congress in December 1907. By 1913, however, the House had outgrown the available office space, and fifty-one rooms {{were added to}} the original structure by raising the roof and constructing a fifth floor that is visible only from the enclosed court. Originally there were 397 offices and fourteen <b>committee</b> <b>rooms</b> in the Cannon Building; the 1932 remodeling resulted in 85 two- or three-room suites, 10 single <b>rooms,</b> and 23 <b>committee</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
500|$|In March 1702 {{the first}} issue of London's first daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was {{published}} in Fleet Street. It was followed by the Morning Chronicle. The publisher John Murray was founded at No.32 Fleet Street in 1762 and remained there until 1812, when it moved to Albemarle Street. The popularity of newspapers was restricted due to various taxes during the early 19th century, particularly paper duty. Peele's Coffee-House at No.177–8 Fleet Street became popular and was the main <b>committee</b> <b>room</b> for the Society for Repealing the Paper Duty, starting in 1858. The society was successful and the duty was abolished in 1861. Along with the repeal of the newspaper tax in 1855, this led to a dramatic expansion of newspaper production in Fleet Street. The [...] "penny press" [...] (newspapers costing one penny) became popular during the 1880s and the initial number of titles had consolidated into a few nationally important ones.|$|E

When questioned by the parliamentary committee about {{the composition of the}} puddle he frequently referred to in his evidence, he had a mass of clay brought into the <b>committee</b> <b>room.</b> He then formed the clay into a trough and showed how it would only form a watertight seal if it had been worked with water to form puddle. [...] "Thus it is" [...] said Brindley [...] "that I form a watertight-trunk to carry water over rivers and valleys wherever they cross the path of the canal." [...] Later, when asked to produce a drawing of the bridge or aqueduct he proposed to build, he replied that he had no representation of it on paper but would demonstrate his intention by use of a model. He then went out and bought a large round of Cheshire cheese, which he divided into two equal halves saying [...] "Here is my model". Then, to the amusement of the committee, he used the two halves of cheese to represent the semicircular arches and laid a long, rectangular object over the top to demonstrate the position of the river flowing under the aqueduct and the canal flowing over it.|$|E
