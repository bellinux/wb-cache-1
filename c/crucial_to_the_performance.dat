The two most popular formations are the single paceline and double paceline. In a single paceline, riders take longer pulls. Often, a double paceline is desirable since each rider takes shorter pulls, and therefore a higher pace is able to be maintained. This is why double pacelines are more often seen {{at the end of}} a TTT event when the teams are nearing the finish line.|$|E

With this being said, the velocity of the inlet stream is <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> of the filter. High velocity inlet streams with relatively large particulates will cause possible clogging and wearing down of the filter media. This will cause an increase in pressure drop of the system. In situations where there filter media is clogged and pressure drop continually increases it is common that waste particles and streams may seep through the zones within the cartridge and pass through the outlet stream resulting in no purification ...|$|E
5000|$|Minimization of both {{coverage}} and overlap is <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> of R-trees. Overlap means that, on data query or insertion, {{more than one}} branch of the tree needs to be expanded (due to the way data is being split in regions which may overlap). A minimized coverage improves pruning performance, allowing to exclude whole pages from search more often, in particular for negative range queries.The R*-tree attempts to reduce both, {{using a combination of}} a revised node split algorithm and the concept of forced reinsertionat node overflow. This is based on the observation that R-tree structures are highly susceptible to the order in which their entries are inserted, so an insertion-built (rather than bulk-loaded) structure is likely to be sub-optimal. Deletion and reinsertion of entries allows them to [...] "find" [...] a place in the tree that may be more appropriate than their original location.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} novel method {{employing}} a hierarchical domain ontology structure to select features representing documents. All raw {{words in the}} training documents are mapped to concepts in a domain ontology. Based on these concepts, a concept hierarchy is established for the training document space, using is-a relationships defined in the domain ontology. An optimum concept set may be obtained by searching the concept hierarchy with an appropriate heuristic function. This {{may be used as}} <b>the</b> feature space <b>to</b> represent <b>the</b> training dataset. The proposed method aims to solve some drawbacks suffered by text classification algorithms and feature selection algorithms. One major difficulty for text classification algorithms, especially for machine learning approaches, is the high dimensionality of the feature space.

5000|$|Since their {{discovery}} in the 1970s aryl onium salts, more specifically iodonium and sulfonium salts, have received much attention and have found many industrial applications. Other, less common, onium salts not mentioned here include ammonium and phosphonium salts.The typical onium compound {{used as a}} photoinitiator contains two or three arene groups for iodonium and sulfonium respectively. Onium salts generally absorb short wavelength light in the UV region spanning from 225300 nm. One characteristic that is <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> of the onium photoinitiators is that the counter anion is non-nucleophilic. Since the Brønsted acid generated during the initiation step is considered the active initiator for polymerization, there is a termination route where the counter ion of the acid could act as the nucleophile instead of a functional groups on the oligomer. Common counter anions include: , , , [...] There is an indirect relationship between {{the size of the}} counter ion and percent conversion.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{computer}} vision techniques and locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) {{are used in}} the VisualRank algorithm. Consider an image search initiated by a text query. An existing search technique based on image metadata and surrounding text is used to retrieve the initial result candidates (PageRank), which along with other images in the index are clustered in a graph according to their similarity (which is precomputed). Centrality is then measured on the clustering, which will return the most canonical image(s) with respect to the query. The idea here is that agreement between users of the web about the image and its related concepts will result in those images being deemed more similar. VisualRank is defined iteratively by , where [...] is the image similarity matrix. As matrices are used, eigenvector centrality will be the measure applied, with repeated multiplication of [...] and [...] producing the eigenvector we're looking for. Clearly, the image similarity measure is <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> of VisualRank since it determines the underlying graph structure.|$|E
50|$|Chokun used ryuka, the {{classical}} poetry of Okinawa, and classical music for his songs. Instruments typically included three stringed instruments: the sanshin (brought from China), the kutu, and the kucho; the hanso, a flute; and two drums, the odaiko and the kodaiko. The lyrics were usually sung by the sanshin players, {{who were the}} most important instrumental component, and songs were used to heighten the mood in intense situations. These songs were <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>performance,</b> and often replaced dialogue much like in Broadway musicals (Foley 8). And as opposed to the spirited music of Okinawa’s common folk, this music was formal and somewhat austere, projecting the idea of nobility through the music. Delivery is formal and full of metaphors just as in Japanese literature of the time. Two styles were applied: strong singing, or kyogin, which was reserved for powerful male roles, and soft singing, known as wagin or yuwajin, which was used for female or young male roles (Foley 8). It {{is important to remember that}} most of the important singing was done by the musicians. The musicians either sat onstage or stage left during the performances, or sat behind a drop since the stage was ordinarily an eighteen-foot platform, much like that of the no (Foley 9). When performed in the present day, the musicians will sit either stage left or in the wings, preserving the uncluttered look of the original, and it is interesting to note that at no time are there more than six actors on stage (Thornbury 231). It is said that the essence of the action holds the importance, rather than the action or peripheral elements themselves. Similarly, realistic props were avoided, and would rather symbolize ideas instead of being taken literally.|$|E
