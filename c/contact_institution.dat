40|$|Changes in version 1. 5. 0 : Support minimal branding: adding <b>contact,</b> <b>{{institution}}</b> name, and institution URL in footer. Added {{monitoring of}} SFM UI queue. The SFM UI queue receives status updates from harvesters and exporters, and updates the {{records for the}} harvests and exports. Monitoring will make problems with SFM UI consuming messages more evident to admins. Warn admins on long queue lengths. Admins will now receive emails when queue lengths get too long. The queue lengths to trigger a warning are configurable. Prevents multiple users from entering the same credentials. Correctly handle quoted terms in search seeds (thanks Reed!) Enforce authorizations consistently in UI. This should not be noticeable in normal use of the application. Note that anyone assigned the staff role {{will be able to}} view all collections and exports, but only make changes based on her group membership. The SFM UI message consumer was moved into its own container from the container was runs the SFM UI application. This will make the logs for the message consumer more accessible and allow it to be automatically restarted by Docker. Added guidance when entering Flickr seeds, as determining the correct identifiers to enter is confusing...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the development of}} farm-based tourism in the less favoured area of the northern Pennines. Farm tourism is conceptualized as an alternative farm enterprise (AFE) comprising one of seven possible `pathways of farm business developmentâ��. As such, the development of farm-based tourism (FBT) is influenced by a range of factors both external and internal to the farm. Lower levels of family labour distinguish tourist AFE farms from non-tourist AFE farms, while different types of FBT are associated with particular farm and household characteristics. Nevertheless, the reasons for adopting tourist enterprises are diverse and often very individualistic. Institutional involvement in FBT {{in the study area}} is increasing, but it is reactive rather than proactive and tends to constrain as well as enable the development of farm tourism. Few farmers have <b>contacted</b> <b>institutions</b> about new or existing farm tourism enterprises. However, levels of inter-agency networking are increasing and a core of eight institutions is now dominating institutional behaviour towards AFEs and FBT in the northern Pennines, especially in Northumberland. More research is needed on the interactions between farm households and institutions in the development of FBT...|$|R

In a multivariate analysis, the number of MUs was positively associated with the number of radiologists (P= 0. 0081), the number of women (P= 0. 0023) and somewhat with the country surface area (P= 0. 077). There is considerable variation in the density of MU across countries and the number of MUs in service are often well above what would be necessary according to local screening recommendations. High number of MUs in some countries may have undesirable consequences, such as unnecessarily high screening frequency and decreased age at which screening is started...|$|R
