40|$|Abstract: The {{most widely}} {{excavated}} iron artifacts used as weapons or farm tools from central southern regions of Korea were subjects of non-metallic inclusion analysis through metallographic examination, microhardness measurement, and {{scanning electron microscopy}} with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Through metallographic inter-pretation and study of the analyzed results, the steel manufacturing and iron smelting using heat processing in the iron artifacts excavated from the central southern region of the ancient Korean peninsula was studied, and {{the analysis of the}} non-metallic inclusions mixed within the metal-lic structures was interpreted as the ternary phase diagram of the oxide to infer the type of iron ores for the iron products and the temperature of the furnace used to smelt them. Most of the ancient forged iron arti-facts showed Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 with high SiO 2 contents and relatively low Al 2 O 3 contents for iron ore, indicating t hat for Al 2 O 3 below 5 %, it is presumed that magnetic iron ores were reduced to bloom iron (sponge iron) with direct-reduction process for production.

At present time, <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>parts</b> production is characterized by small size lots of components which often have very different geometries. Moreover, {{it is easy to}} find that every single part of the same lot {{is quite different from the}} others, due to different burrs, varying in size and geometrical shape. Then <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>parts</b> deburring is a hard task which requires extreme flexibility. For this reason industrial robots seem to be the ideal solution; unfortunately the long time needed for programming the robot and the manufacturing cycle, together with the parts variability and components range reduces heavily the overall manufacturing efficiency and profitability. For this reason, novel intelligent manufacturing methods must be realized and implemented. In the present paper it will be presented the integrated design and development of a new generation of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>parts</b> robotic intelligent deburring and the engineering design methods adopted to achieve such results. The deburring of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>parts</b> is performed by anthropomorphous robots with the integrated aid of vision systems, custom designed adaptive compliance tools and virtual prototypes of the cell itself, where it is possible to simulate all the different manufacturing tasks and automatically generate the code for the robotic cell numeric control.

40|$|Abstract. The {{structure}} and properties of {{grey cast iron}} castings are considerably influenced by the cooling rate during solidification. In order to obtain grey <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>parts</b> with a hard superficial layer (wear resistant), external metallic coolers are placed on those surfaces during casting. This {{is the case of}} cam pushers, camshafts, driving shafts, metalworking rolls, etc. Cast iron coolers or steel coolers are mostly used in practice. The cooling rate during solidification is influenced by the thermo-physical characteristics of the coolers. This paper presents the results obtained by simulation and experimental research on coolers material influence on the {{structure and}} hardness of the surface layer of a pearlitic cast iron sample. It was studied the solidification of samples with dimensions 20 x 20 x 60 mm, cast of pearlitic cast iron in six variants: without a cooler and in the presence of some metallic coolers of different thermo-physical characteristics (iron, steel, copper, titanium and aluminum coated with a thin layer of steel). It was studied the influence of cooler material on structure of the superficial layer, on thickness of the hardened layer, on superficial hardness, on the temperature field and cooling rates.

40|$|The {{phenolic}} urethane cold-box (PUCB) {{process was}} first introduced to the foundry industry in the late 1960 s. Since then, it {{has become one of}} the most popular methods to make foundry purpose sand moulds and cores, utilized in the manufacturing of aluminium and cast iron cast components. The factors to be considered, affecting the general performance of a PUCB moulding mixture, are the temperature of sand, the moisture content, the mixing conditions, etc. Moreover, there are variable production parameters such as binder level, to improve certain properties of the mould and/or the core based on their specific area of application. These are mainly mechanical properties such as tensile or splitting strength. They have significant influences on the behaviour of the moulding material and are usually tested at room temperature. Although the production phases of the PUCB system are refined to a high extent today, the effect of binder content on the quality of the mould/core and the final casting should be supported by new approaches also in thermal sciences, interpreted in high-temperature environment. In this work, different PUCB mixtures were produced to evaluate the effect of various binder levels on the thermophysical properties of sand cores. Thermogravimetry, differential thermal analysis and a novel application of Fourier thermal analysis were used to study the decomposition processes of the PUCB mixture and to reveal the impact of binder level on the heat absorption (cooling) capacity of sand cores at temperatures relevant in the manufacturing of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>parts</b> (1300  ±  10  °C) ...|$|E
40|$|The phd project {{started with}} a {{literature}} review and identification of research gaps {{in the areas of}} interest identified by Jøtul, the lead foundry in the Autocast foundry consortium and discussion with advisor. The thesis covers the results of two focus areas. The described results were also presented during the quarterly meetings organized by the consortium during the phd project timeframe (Jan 2010 - Jan 2013) Focus Area I Laboratory experiments were conducted to estimate holding forces generated from the probable range of electromagnet voltages during industrial use. A milling machine setup at the laboratory at NTNU Valgrinda was used for experiments. The distance of the electromagnet from the cast iron plate was controlled by the vertical motion of the milling machine. The vertical holding forces were measured with a National Instruments data acquisition system. The holding forces were simulated using a commercial software and qualitative explanation of the deviations of the model compared to experiments is also provided. The same experimental set-up were used to estimate friction values one could expect for the material pair in action. Since the <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>parts</b> are much harder than the gripper material, rapid wear of the electromagnet was observed. Focus Area II This focus area describes a methodology for internal traceability and proposes a control plan documentation approach. The industrial need for developing traceability systems originates from regulations, standards and customer specific requirements. The Phd requirements from the ad published by Autocast 2009 : The leading Norwegian manufactures of castings for the international market need new technology to meet the international competition and the environment-, health- and safety requirements. This implies a considerable emphasis on the development of new technology to enhance the use of automation and robotics in the foundries. The work will include development of both theoretical methods and physical laboratory demonstrations of the technological solutions. The candidate is expected to have a close connection with AutoCast’s industrial partners during the entire extension of the PhD project, in particular with the project owner Jøtul, and use these as living labs.

However, using the measurement of outer corner flank wear technique, the average tool life of uncoated twist drills was increased by factors of 4. 5, 6. 5 and 6. 9 by Ti 0. 59 Al 0. 41 N, Ti 0. 27 Al 0. 19 Cr 0. 54 N and Ti 0. 21 Al 0. 14 Cr 0. 65 N coatings, respectively. In the case of 'screech' failure, the average tool life of uncoated twist drills was increased by factors of 3. 9, 7. 3 and 10. 8 by Ti 0. 59 Al 0. 41 N, Ti 0. 27 Al 0. 19 Cr 0. 54 N and Ti 0. 21 Al 0. 14 Cr 0. 65 N coatings, respectively. The performance of twist drills was also assessed using a number of quantitative techniques, namely, measurement of thrust and torque, hole diameter and drill wear. The latter was also observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) which showed an early onset of workpiece material transfer at the margins of the uncoated drills. In the case of the PVD coated drills, an improvement in the tribological interaction between the coatings and the grey <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> workpiece resulted in a significant reduction in material transfer at the drill margins. The above results are discussed in terms of their affect on hole diameter and cutting forces...|$|R
