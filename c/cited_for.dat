5|$|Incorrect {{figures are}} {{sometimes}} <b>cited</b> <b>for</b> {{the population of}} ASL speakers in the United States based on misunderstandings of known statistics. Demographics of the deaf population have been confused with those of ASL use, since adults who become deaf late in life rarely use ASL in the home. This accounts for currently cited estimations which are greater than 500,000; such mistaken estimations can reach as high as 15,000,000. A 100,000-person lower bound has been <b>cited</b> <b>for</b> ASL users; {{the source of this}} figure is unclear, but it may be an estimate of prelingual deafness, which is correlated with but not equivalent to signing.|$|E
5|$|Buckner {{was again}} <b>cited</b> <b>for</b> gallant conduct at the Battle of Molino del Rey, and was {{appointed}} a brevet captain. He {{participated in the}} Battle of Chapultepec, the Battle of Belen Gate, and the storming of Mexico City. At {{the conclusion of the}} war, American soldiers served as an army of occupation, which left them time for leisure activities. Buckner joined the Aztec Club, and in April 1848 {{was a part of the}} successful expedition of Popocatépetl, a volcano southeast of Mexico City. Buckner was accorded the honor of lowering the American flag over Mexico City for the last time during the occupation.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Dynamite Headdy was positive. Critics {{highlighted the}} game's originality and creativity in distinguishing it among other {{games in the}} action-platform genre. They also commended Treasure for demonstrating their technical expertise with impressive graphical effects and building {{on the success of}} their earlier game Gunstar Heroes (1993). In reviews from the time and in retrospect, Dynamite Headdy is <b>cited</b> <b>for</b> being one of the best games on the Genesis. An 8-bit port was released for Game Gear, which itself served as the basis for a Master System port released exclusively in Brazil.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, the Utah Department of Transportation petitioned {{to extend}} US666 {{northwest}} to Richfield, but {{the proposal was}} rejected. The proposed extension followed SR95, SR24, and SR119. A concurrency with US191 would have been routed through Blanding and Monticello to connect {{to the rest of}} the route. One of the reasons <b>cited</b> <b>for</b> rejecting the proposal was that portions of SR24 were not built to standards desired for additions to the U.S. Highway System.|$|E

5|$|Makriyannis, {{having been}} ignored by history, and hardly {{mentioned}} by chroniclers of the War of Independence, had {{renewed interest in}} the revolution by offering a significant personal testimony to historical research.

One could say that Makriyannis was forgotten, {{not only as a}} fighter, but also as the author of a text written in Demotic Greek; a text that, besides reproducing the heroic atmosphere of the War of Independence, is also a treasure-house of linguistic knowledge concerning the common Greek tongue of the time.|$|E

Vick had hidden the information from the team and the infraction was not discovered until January. The traffic stop, an earlier suspension from the team, and his unsportsmanlike conduct during the 2005 ACC Championship Game and 2006 Gator Bowl were used as grounds for his dismissal.|$|E

5|$|Prog {{is based}} on fusions of styles, {{approaches}} and genres, involving a continuous move between formalism and eclecticism. Due to its historical reception, prog's scope is sometimes limited to a stereotype of long solos, overlong albums, fantasy lyrics, grandiose stage sets and costumes, and an obsessive dedication to technical skill. While the genre is often <b>cited</b> <b>for</b> its merging of high culture and low culture, few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree, and {{only a handful of}} groups purposely emulated or referenced classical music.|$|E

According to The Daily Beast, Game of Thrones was a favorite of sitcom writers and the series has been referred to in other TV series. With other fantasy series, it has been <b>cited</b> <b>for</b> an increase in the purchase (and abandonment) of huskies and other wolf-like dogs.|$|E
5|$|Two {{vacancies}} {{occurred on}} the Supreme Court during Tyler's presidency, as Justices Smith Thompson and Henry Baldwin died in 1843 and 1844, respectively. Tyler, ever at odds with Congress—including the Whig-controlled Senate—nominated several men to the Supreme Court to fill these seats. However, the Senate successively voted against confirming John C. Spencer, Reuben Walworth, Edward King and John M. Read (Walworth was rejected three times, King rejected twice). One reason <b>cited</b> <b>for</b> the Senate's actions was the hope that Clay would fill the vacancies after winning the 1844 presidential election. Tyler's four unsuccessful nominees are the most by a president.|$|E
5|$|Covered Bridges Today {{provides}} information on 412 bridges in the states of Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. The book is geographically focused on Krekeler's home state of Ohio and includes all 142 remaining covered bridges in the state {{at the time of}} writing. However, the book is not a complete inventory of each state's extant bridges. When it was written, 76 of an estimated 228 Pennsylvania's bridges were included, 68 of Indiana's 98 covered bridges, and 43 of Vermont's estimated 100 bridges were also featured. Krekeler's use of estimations stems from the facts that covered bridges are lost periodically and that the bridges detailed include those restored or in immediate danger of collapse. Within a year of the publication of the book, 30 bridges were lost. Known bridges in states that are not in the listing are not named or <b>cited.</b> <b>For</b> example, West Virginia had 17 remaining bridges at time of publication, but the book only covers 10 of them.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Unleashed was mixed, with Metacritic aggregate {{scores of}} 60 and 54 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions respectively, and 66 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions. The added element of motion controls for the Werehog sections, {{as well as}} text-based hub worlds and better Werehog level design and camera system, were reasons <b>cited</b> <b>for</b> the higher review scores for the Wii version of the game, though a few review websites, such as 1UP, gave the Wii version a lower score than its Xbox 360 and PS3 counterparts. Nevertheless, the game was a commercial success and sold 2.45 million units combined making it Sega's third best selling game during their last fiscal year period of 2008.|$|E
5|$|Development of System Shock 2 {{began in}} 1997 when Looking Glass Studios {{approached}} Irrational Games {{with an idea}} to co-develop a new game. The development team were fans of System Shock and sought to create a similar game. Early story ideas were similar to the novella Heart of Darkness. In an early draft, the player was tasked with assassinating an insane commander on a starship. The original title of the game, according to its pitch document, was Junction Point. The philosophy of the design was to continue to develop {{the concept of a}} dungeon crawler, like , in a science fiction setting, the basis for System Shock. However, the press mistook System Shock to be closer to a Doom clone which was <b>cited</b> <b>for</b> poor financial success of System Shock. With Junction Point, the goal was to add in significant role-playing elements and a persistent storyline as to distance the game from Doom.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, {{more than}} 40 {{people were killed}} in a fire {{accident}} in a firecracker unit. The police traced out unregistered units and irregularities that led to the accident. In a fire accident in August 2011, seven people were killed and five were seriously injured. A similar fire accident and blast in a private unit in September 2012 killed 40 people and injured 38 others. The common reasons <b>cited</b> <b>for</b> the accidents are inadequate training of workers and supervisors involved in different stages of production and marketing of firecracker items. Other reasons are found to be overstocking of explosives, raw material and finished goods, and employment of workers in excess of the permitted strength.|$|E
