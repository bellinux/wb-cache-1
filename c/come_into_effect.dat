5|$|Ryzhkov and Gorbachev {{continued}} {{their work on}} economic reform and in 1987 began drafting the Law on the State Enterprise, which restricted the authority of central planners.

5|$|The Allied {{story for}} FUSAG {{was that the}} army group, based in {{south-east}} England, would invade the Pas-de-Calais region several weeks after a smaller diversionary landing in Normandy. In reality, the main invasion force would land in Normandy on D-Day. As D-Day approached, the LCS moved on to planning tactical deceptions to help cover {{the progress of the}} real invasion forces. As well as naval operations, the LCS also planned operations involving paratroopers and ground deceptions. The latter would <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> once landings were made but the former (involving naval, air and special forces units) were used to cover the approach of the true invasion fleet.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{positions}} available to women in the ADF has increased over time. Although servicewomen were initially barred from combat positions, these restrictions began to be lifted in 1990. In 2010 approximately 92% of employment categories and 84% of positions in the ADF were available to females as well as males. In September 2011 Minister for Defence Stephen Smith announced that the Cabinet had decided to remove all restrictions on women serving in combat positions, and that this change would <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> within five years. This decision {{was supported by the}} CDF and the chiefs of the services. Women became able to apply for all positions other than special forces roles in the Army on 1 January 2013. This remaining restriction was removed during 2016.|$|E

On 18 January 2016, key provisions of the law (including spouses, stepparents, civil partners and cohabiting partners being able to apply to become guardians of a child or for custody) went into effect, following the signing of a commencement order by the Minister for Justice and Equality.

5|$|A fairly {{peculiar}} economic phenomenon {{occurred during}} the war in that the Confederate government issued both regular money notes and interest-bearing money, although the United States did issue Interest Bearing Notes during the war that were legal tender for most financial transactions. The circulation of the interest-bearing money and the convertibility of one kind of money into the other was enforced by fiat and Southern banks were threatened with a return to the gold standard if they did not cooperate. Because of the amount of Southern debt held by foreigners, to ease currency convertibility, in 1863 the Confederate Congress decided to adopt the gold standard, although actual convertibility was not to <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> until 1879 (hence the law never went into effect, being supplanted by the Coinage Act of 1873 {{and the end of the}} Confederacy).|$|E

5|$|A re-think was required. Cook had the unenviable task of {{explaining}} {{the failure to}} the government. Henceforth, he would take a tighter grip on the hydrogen bomb programme, gradually superseding Penney. The scientists and politicians considered abandoning Green Granite. The Minister of Defence, Duncan Sandys, queried Cook on the imperative to persist with thermonuclear designs, given that Orange Herald satisfied most military requirements, and the tests were very expensive. Cook replied that megaton-range fission bombs represented an uneconomical use of expensive fissile material; {{that they could not}} be built to produce yields of more than a megaton; and that they could not be made small enough to be carried by aircraft smaller than the V-bombers, or on missiles. Sandys was not convinced, but he authorised further tests, as did the Prime Minister, now Harold Macmillan following Eden's resignation {{in the wake of the}} Suez crisis. The earliest possible date was November 1957 unless the Operation Antler tests were cancelled; but the Foreign Office warned that a moratorium on nuclear testing might <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> in late October.|$|E
5|$|As the queen's son Radama grew to adulthood, {{he became}} {{increasingly}} disillusioned {{by the high}} death toll of his mother's military campaigns and traditional measures of justice, and was frustrated by her unilateral rejection of European influence. The young prince developed sympathetic relationships with the handful of Europeans permitted by Ranavalona to frequent her court, namely Jean Laborde and Joseph-François Lambert, with whom he privately concluded the lucrative Lambert Charter. The charter, which would <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> upon Radama's accession to the throne, granted Lambert large tracts of land and exclusive rights to road construction, mineral extraction, timber harvesting and other activities on the island. In May 1857, when Rainilaiarivony was 29 years old, Lambert consequently invited Prince Radama, Rainivoninahitriniony, Rainilaiarivony {{and a number of}} other officers to conspire with him in a plot to overthrow Ranavalona.|$|E
5|$|Gromyko and Harriman debated how states {{not universally}} {{recognized}} (e.g., East Germany and China) could join the agreement. The US proposed asserting that accession {{to the treaty}} would not indicate international recognition. This {{was rejected by the}} Soviet Union. Eventually, with Kennedy's approval, US envoys Fisher and McNaughton devised a system whereby multiple government would serve as depositaries for the treaty, allowing individual states to sign only the agreement held by the government of their choice in association with other like-minded states. This solution, which overcame one of the more challenging roadblocks in the negotiations, also served to allay mounting concerns from Macmillan, which were relayed to Washington, that an agreement would once again be derailed. Finally, in an original Soviet draft, the signature of France would have been required for the treaty to <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect.</b> At Harriman's insistence, this requirement was removed.|$|E
