The Center for Advanced Manufacturing at the Potchefstroom {{campus of}} the North West University aims to develop a twin screw {{extruder}} that is able to process powder <b>coating</b> <b>resin.</b> The facility has thus far produced various components and sub systems for local and international manufacturers of extrusion products. The research presented in this thesis aims to both develop a twin screw extruder with an integrated cooling roller system and to investigate {{of the performance of}} a twin screw extruder. The development of a twin screw extruder consists of the selection of the drive section of the extruder, the complete design of a twin screw extruder gearbox, the investigation and design of a suitable barrel for the manufacturing of powder coatings as well as the development of a unique cooling roller unit for the forming of the processed product when exiting the extruder. The extruder was manufactured from the designed components and systems. It was found on further testing that it was capable of producing a powder <b>coating</b> <b>resin</b> of good quality. In order to evaluate the performance of an extruder, the transfer of energy through the extruder needs to be understood. Furthermore it is necessary to understand the theory behind each type of energy being consumed by the extruder, as well as the factors influencing the usage of that energy. The theories investigated were verified in practice by measuring the energy consumption of a twin screw extruder operated under various conditions. These tests provided a correlation between the consumption of mechanical and electrical energy. The results gave an indication of the effectiveness of the screw configuration of the processing section of the extruder, making it possible to determine how the configuration should be amended in order to improve the performance of the extruder. The two aims of the thesis were satisfactory completed. The developed twin screw extruder is able to manufacture powder coatings of good quality and the performance evaluation of a twin screw extruder was also successfully completed. It enables the manufacturer to measure and evaluate the energy consumption of the process in order to improve the performance of the extruder. Master...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Fiber optic sensor {{with small}} size, light weight and {{immunity}} to electromagnetic interference can be embedded and {{integrated into the}} host material to form a smart structure system. One must recognize that optical fibers are foreign entities to the host structure, therefore will alter the stress state {{in the vicinity of}} the embedded sensor irrespective of the small size of the fiber. This is a result of the material and geometric discontinuity introduced by the embedded optical fiber. In this study, the local stress fields {{in the vicinity of the}} embedded fiber are examined. The host material is considered to be a composite with reinforced fiber parallel to the optical fiber. The geometry in the vicinity of the embedded fiber is modeled by four concentric cylinders which represent the optical fiber, protective <b>coating,</b> <b>resin</b> and host material, respectively. In this investigation, the host structure is subjected to longitudinal normal stress and transverse hydro-static stress.

40|$|Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) of resin coated {{silica sands}} is a {{promising}} technology for shell-mould casting fabrication. In {{the scientific literature}} a deep lack of information is present about this subject. Several aspects have to be studied to correctly analyse this process: the initial sand properties, the contact area among grains, the thermal conductivity dependence on thermal history and the pre-heating effect during hardening. These aspects are discussed by the authors in the current paper and are fundamental for {{the definition of a}} new SLS procedure to produce consolidated components directly by a diode laser, without any further oven treatment. Sand hardening depends on several mechanisms: the <b>coating</b> <b>resin</b> flow, its cure and thermal degradation. Best results in terms of mechanical properties of sand components can be obtained if sufficient time is given for resin flow before the cure initiation, without generating the thermal degradation.

40|$|<b>Coating</b> <b>resin</b> {{chemical}} fertilizer using alkyd resin and polyethylene resin is added into soils, {{and it is}} a problem that these resins remain in the soils. Therefore, we investigated the degradation of these resins in the soils. The results obtained were as follows. 1) The dergradation ratio of alkyd resin was higher than polyethylene resin. Three month later, the former was 4. 5 % and the latter was below 0. 5 %. The result that the degradation ratio of alkyd resin was higher in soil with a high humus content suggested that the degradation of the coating material is microbiological. 2) There were no differences between alkyd and polyethylene resins in the number of microorganisms on the coating membrane surface and in the soil around the coating membrane, but the number of fungi in the former was about 100 times higher in the coating membrane and was about 10 times higher in the soil around the coating membrane than in the latter. In addition, using the trial box for the measurement of enzymatic activity, soil enzymatic activity concerned with the degradation of alkyd resin membrane was measured, and the results showed that the activity of the soil enzymes was high nearer the membrane. 3) Under field conditions, we took the buried membrane out of soils and observed its surface by electron microscopy. It was observed that the surface of the alkyd resin membrane was consequently degraded than the surface of polyethylene resin. These results definitely show that the alkyd resin membrane was degraded faster than the polyethylene resin membrane by the microorganisms in soils, and it thus appears to be a good material for use in coated fertilizer...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Effects {{of three}} mulches of tree foliage and twigs (red alder, Douglas-fir, and salal) and homogenized, {{partially}} decomposed material (forest floor) on soil macronutrients (Ca, K, Mg, P, NO 3, and NH 4) were evaluated {{in the summer}} of 1997. These effects were measured with buried, coated ion-exchange resin bags at two different times (2 and 12 weeks) and at two different depths (2 and 15 cm) in homogenized soil cores. Over the time of this study various mulches had no significantly different impact on nutrient ions sorbed on the buried resins. The results indicated that {{in the early stages of}} decomposition, chemical differences in the plant material evaluated do not differentially influence soluble nutrients sorbed on buried resins. However, some of this lack of difference may have been due to the preparation of the mulches. The preparation included chopping and shredding, which may have eliminated differences that exist in a more natural setting. The effect of forest floor material was significant on three of six response variables. The interaction of forest floor and mulch was significant for all variables except K. Whether the interaction decreased or increased the mean amount of a given response variable was dependent on the type of mulch material. The exception was NO 3, which in all cases increased in the presence of forest floor in combination with mulch. The results indicate that microbial populations that reside in the forest floor interact differently with the types of plant mulches placed over them. The effect of time was significant for all response variables with K, Ca, and Mg responding in a proportional manner. Nitrate and ammonium concentrations increased exponentially over time, which indicated a rather vigorous biological population involved in decomposition of nitrogen-containing organic compounds. The effect of depth was significant for all variables except for P. More nutrients accumulated at the 15 cm depth than at the 2 cm depth, which was not expected. This possibly indicates high immobilization due to microbes at the surface. The results of P may have been due to the type of resin used and the pH of the soil cores. The results suggest that forest floor material has more influence with above ground additions of soil macro-nutrients than fresh plant material. However, the detected interactions of these two types of materials suggest that ion cycling can be influenced very early in the litter decomposition process. A second study tested the effect of saturated soil coated resin bags versus non-coated bags. The results strongly suggest that the effect of <b>coating</b> <b>resin</b> bags with a thin slurry of saturated soil paste significantly decreases variation in tests of Ca, Mg, NO 3, and NH 4. The minimal amount of work with this procedure suggests that it is advantageous for evaluating most macro-nutrients with resin bags, particularly NO 3 and NH 4...|$|E
