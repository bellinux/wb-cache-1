The affordable cost relative to existing business jets and ability to use many of the existing small, minimally equipped, but conveniently located airports is projected to stimulate a large demand for the aircraft.

2500|$|Highland County has {{no public}} {{airfield}}s; however, {{there is a}} private airfield located within the county south of Monterey. [...] <b>Commercial</b> <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> {{is available at the}} Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport in neighboring Augusta County, Virginia. [...] Highland County also lacks any rail lines; the nearest railroad is a CSX Transportation line located in Augusta County, which also provides passenger rail service via Amtrak in Staunton. [...] Historically, no permanent rail lines ever existed within the county's borders, though several were proposed. [...] In the 1870s, there were prospects of a railroad named the Washington, Cincinnati, and St. Louis Railroad entering the county. [...] This line was proposed as a narrow gauge railroad to be built from Harrisonburg, Virginia to Monterey and then westward into West Virginia, eventually reaching western markets. [...] The railroad, which has been described as being [...] "so poorly conceived that its failure was inevitable", was never built. [...] Another potential railroad to enter Highland County was chartered by the Virginia General Assembly on February 29, 1892 as the Augusta, Highland, and Alleghany Railroad. [...] This railroad was to connect with either the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway or Valley Railroad in Augusta County and build a line towards Monterey. The Augusta, Highland, and Alleghany Railroad appears to have never been organized or built, as documents from 1911 and 1922 state that no railroad existed in the county. [...] The prospects of a railroad reaching Highland were limited due to the mountainous terrain and a general lack of sufficient traffic to make such an investment economically viable.|$|E

40|$|Network science, or {{the art of}} {{describing}} system structure, may be useful for the analysis and control of large, complex systems. For example, networks exhibiting scale-free structure {{have been found to}} be particularly well suited to deal with environmental uncertainty and large demand growth. The National Airspace System may be, at least in part, a scalable network. In fact, the hub-and-spoke structure of the commercial segment of the NAS is an often-cited example of an existing scale-free network After reviewing the nature and attributes of scale-free networks, this assertion is put to the test: is <b>commercial</b> <b>air</b> carrier <b>transportation</b> in the United States well explained by this model? If so, are the positive attributes of these networks, e. g. those of efficiency, flexibility and robustness, fully realized, or could we effect substantial improvement? This paper first outlines attributes of various network types, then looks more closely at the common carrier <b>air</b> <b>transportation</b> network from perspectives of the traveler, the airlines, and Air Traffic Control (ATC). Network models are applied within each paradigm, including discussion of implied strengths and weaknesses of each model. Finally, known limitations of scalable networks are discussed. With an eye towards NAS operations, utilizing the strengths and avoiding the weaknesses of scale-free networks are addressed. ...|$|R

As the main reason for this development the paper identifies a much more rapid growing net of airfields affiliated with a service network for airplanes in comparison to airships. Huge rigid airships needed a different net with more expensive equipment and therefore this net grew much slower along with the affiliated service network. Thus, airplane networks surpassed a critical mass of net-building much earlier and displaced the airship {{in spite of the fact}} that in civil areas it was technologically advantageous...|$|R

The mechanism of choice is computer simulation. Unfortunately, the fundamental paradigms of the current air traffic control simulation models do not directly support the broad range of operational options and environments necessary to study tiltrotor operations. Modification of current air traffic simulation models to meet these requirements does not appear viable given the range and complexity of issues needing resolution. As a result, the investigation of systemic, infrastructure issues surrounding the effects of tiltrotor commercial operations requires new approaches to simulation modeling. These models should be based on perspectives and ideas closer to those associated with tiltrotor air traffic operations...|$|R

40|$|Commercial {{space is}} {{expected}} to significantly {{reduce the cost of}} transporting people and payload into orbit. In addition to conventional launchers, novel launch concepts include suborbital aircraft, high altitude balloons or flying launch platforms. As a result, new mission profiles, usage concepts and an increased need for launch capacity are leading to a growing interest in expanding space activities and making their operation possible from locations all over the world. The dynamics of this process can be seen in an already rapidly growing number of <b>commercial</b> launches. <b>Air</b> Traffic Management (ATM) is challenged to integrate those vehicles in safe and efficient ways. The ATM integration concept must follow a common approach that can accommodate all different types of commercial spacecraft operations. Its goal must be to allow for a sustainable development of both, <b>commercial</b> <b>air</b> and space <b>transportation.</b> Therefore, harmonization and global interoperability is key, as it ensures seamless operation between systems, an accepted set of common technical and operational standards and minimized costs through identified synergies. This paper describes the necessary evolution of commercial space ATM integration towards a concept that is addressing as well interoperability issues between the aviation and space domains as between the ATM systems of different world regions. Based on an approach that accommodates key elements of the future Single European Sky (SES) and the US Next Generation <b>Air</b> <b>Transportation</b> System (NextGen), its backbone is a dedicated CST service for the System Wide Information Management (SWIM). It is designed to facilitate on-time availability of required information to plan, monitor and accommodate space flights within the airspace system at all relevant stakeholder levels. The provision of adequate flight planning information and updates together with continuous surveillance data during all flight phases relevant for ATM is essential to enable the developed solution. Interoperability aspects of essential CNS functionalities are therefore crucial for successful implementation of the suggested integration concept and have to be considered specifically...|$|R
