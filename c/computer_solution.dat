50|$|This is the case, for example, in {{critical}} applications where any {{errors in the}} algorithm would have very serious consequences; or when using a computer to prove a mathematical theorem. Brute-force search is also useful as a baseline method when benchmarking other algorithms or metaheuristics. Indeed, brute-force search {{can be viewed as}} the simplest metaheuristic. Brute force search {{should not be confused with}} backtracking, where large sets of solutions can be discarded without being explicitly enumerated (as in the textbook <b>computer</b> <b>solution</b> to the eight queens problem above). The brute-force method for finding an item in a table — namely, check all entries of the latter, sequentially — is called linear search.|$|E

In August of that year, Kryptiq finished raising $7.9 million in venture capital from investors such as Voyager Capital and SmartForest Ventures.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 A {{numerical}} {{technique is}} presented for solving the gas dynamics of a pulsating combustor. The <b>computer</b> <b>solution</b> which is developed follows {{directly from the}} fundamental conservation laws applied to discrete volumes rather than attempting either to finite difference the resulting partial differential equations, or to apply the Method of Characteristics. The integration procedure closely relates to the physical model, and various types of boundary conditions and diffusion effects can be included. The addition of diffusion terms also helps to dampen oscillations caused by near discontinuities in the flow field, spreading these discontinuities over several cell widths. Combustion processes {{are included in the}} <b>computer</b> <b>solution</b> by following the concentrations of the injected fuel and the oxygen aspirated from the atmosphere, and computing the energy released when the fuel ignites. The results obtained using this technique show reasonable agreement with those obtained using the Method of Characteristics, and with actual test data...|$|E
