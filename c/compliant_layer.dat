40|$|High {{residual}} stresses within intermetallic and {{metal matrix composite}} systems can develop upon cooling from the processing temperature to room temperature due to the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) mismatch between the fiber and matrix. As a result, within certain composite systems, radial, circumferential, and/or longitudinal cracks have been observed to form at the fiber-matrix interface. The <b>compliant</b> <b>layer</b> concept (insertion of a compensating interface material between the fiber and matrix) was proposed to reduce or eliminate the residual stress buildup during cooling and thus minimize cracking. The viability of the proposed <b>compliant</b> <b>layer</b> concept is investigated both elastically and elastoplastically. A detailed parametric study was conducted using a unit cell model consisting of three concentric cylinders to determine the required character (i. e., thickness and material properties) of the <b>compliant</b> <b>layer</b> as well as its applicability. The unknown <b>compliant</b> <b>layer</b> mechanical properties were expressed as ratios of the corresponding temperature dependent Ti- 24 Al- 11 Nb (a/o) matrix properties. The fiber properties taken were those corresponding to SCS- 6 (SiC). Results indicate that the <b>compliant</b> <b>layer</b> can be used to reduce, if not eliminate, radial and circumferential {{residual stresses}} within the fiber and matrix and therefore also reduce or eliminate the radial cracking. However, with this decrease in in-plane stresses, one obtains an increase in longitudinal stress, thus potentially initiating longitudinal cracking.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this report is a contribution to ongoing research to develop more effective orthopaedic joint systems though fundamental studies of the behaviour of various novel material combinations and component configurations. <b>Compliant</b> <b>layer</b> technology, incorporating a low elastic modulus polyurethane layer for the bearing surface, has been proposed to offer prolonged longevity of artificial joints by maintaining a fluid film between the articulating surfaces thus reducing friction and wear. To ensure a complaint layer joint retains fit, form and function over its lifetime, material characterisation techniques were employed. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) highlighted {{the sensitivity of the}} modulus of Bionate® polyurethanes 80 A and 75 D to temperature; in particular for 75 D it revealed the close proximity of its glass transition temperature to in vivo operating temperatures and this shows a strong need for accurate temperature control during in vitro testing. The ability of aqueous lubricants to plasticise Bionate® materials was also demonstrated through DMTA, with reductions in the moduli and damping behaviour for hydrated samples being seen. Through a series of creep experiments, the non-linear viscoelastic behaviour of Bionate® polyurethane materials was demonstrated. Creep rupture was not observed over the test periods, and sample deformation increased considerably with increasing stress as well as temperature and lubrication. Bionate® 75 D displayed significantly lower creep strain and greater permanent deformation that 80 A. The creep data set should essentially allow development of improved designs in <b>compliant</b> <b>layer</b> technology. The tribological performance of the <b>compliant</b> <b>layer</b> articulation as a function of material combinations, implant conformity and implant size was assessed. In order to do this it was necessary to measure the frictional torque and develop tribological functional plots to determine the mode of lubrication. In this study a variety of material combinations for both hip and knee prostheses were investigated using a friction simulator. Firstly, through correlation with other published studies a friction simulator was validated using conventional ultra- high molecular weight polyethylene. Subsequently, metal-on-compliant layer hip and knee prostheses were assessed both experimentally using Stribeck analysis and theoretically using the theory of Hamrock and Dowson. Overall, the performance of <b>compliant</b> <b>layer</b> bearings was promising of improved in vivo behaviour in that fluid film lubrication and relatively low friction factors were achieved with synthetic lubricants. A strong correlation between experimental results and theoretical predictions were observed. The wear performance of a newly developed <b>compliant</b> <b>layer</b> glenoid, designed specifically to utilise <b>compliant</b> <b>layer</b> technology, in total shoulder arthroplasty was investigated. Results suggest that this type of glenoid may be more robust compared to the conventional UHMWPE glenoid. Impingement wear on the <b>compliant</b> <b>layer</b> surface was a frequent finding and was caused from repeated contact between the rim of the hemispherical humeral component and the articular surface of the glenoid, under a constant load. The addition of Vitamin E to <b>compliant</b> <b>layer</b> acetabular components was shown experimentally to have no effect on the friction characteristics of the material. MPC (2 -methacryloyloxethyl phosphorylcholine) grafting on the surface of highly crosslinked polyethylene acetabular components increased the friction and it was postulated that the phospholipids acted as boundary lubricants within a mixed lubrication regime. Larger joints are being developed to improve joint stability, propioception and functional longevity. The friction and lubrication properties of large diameter hip bearings of metal-on-metal and ceramic-on-reinforced polymer couplings were assessed. The frictional studies showed that the metal-on-metal joints worked under the mixed lubrication regime, producing similar friction factor values to each other. The ceramic-on-reinforced polymer samples were shown to operate with high friction factors and mixed lubrication. The study demonstrated that the component’s diameter had little or no influence on the lubrication and friction of the large bearing combinations tested...|$|E

40|$|We {{recently}} developed a time-stepping method for simulating rigid multi-body systems with intermittent contact that {{is implicit in}} the geometric information [1]. In this paper, we extend this formulation to quasi-rigid or locally compliant objects, i. e., objects with a rigid core surrounded by a <b>compliant</b> <b>layer,</b> similar to Song et al. [2]. The difference in our compliance model from existing quasi-rigid models is that, based on physical motivations, we assume the <b>compliant</b> <b>layer</b> has a maximum possible normal deflection beyond which it acts as a rigid body. Therefore, we use {{an extension of the}} Kelvin-Voigt (i. e. linear springdamper) model for obtaining the normal contact forces by incorporating the thickness of the <b>compliant</b> <b>layer</b> explicitly in the contact model. We use the Kelvin-Voigt model for the tangential forces and assume that the contact forces and moment satisfy an ellipsoidal friction law. We model each object as an intersection of convex inequalities and write the contact constraint as a complementarity constraint between the contact force and a distance function dependent on the closest points and the local deformation of the body. The closest points satisfy a system of nonlinear algebraic equations and the resultant continuous model is a Differential Complementarity Problem (DCP). This enables us to formulate a geometrically implicit time-stepping scheme for solving the DCP which is more accurate than a geometrically explicit scheme. The discrete problem to be solved at each time-step is a mixed nonlinear complementarity problem...|$|E

The present study includes variations of compliant layers and their properties to determine their influence on unidirectional composite and constituent response. Two simulation methods are used for these studies. The first approach is based on a three-dimensional linear finite element analysis of a 9 fiber unidirectional composite system. The second approach is a micromechanics based nonlinear computer code developed to determine the behavior of metal matrix composite system for thermal and mechanical loads.

40|$|The {{tribology}} of a {{wide range}} of designs of <b>compliant</b> <b>layer</b> acetabular cups has been evaluated using a simulator. The simulator applied a dynamic load of 2 kN and a sinusoidal motion of ± 25, and measured the frictional resistance directly. In general the friction developed in these joints was extremely low, with friction factors typically below 0. 01. When the experimental results were compared with theoretical estimates of friction a poor correlation was found. Further analysis suggested that the design of <b>compliant</b> <b>layer</b> acetabular cups was insensitive to many of the parameters suggested by theory. In particular, the radial clearance and femoral head size were not found to be critical. In addition, methods were proposed and their effectiveness demonstrated to measure friction at the on-set of motion (start-up friction), and the steady state friction in realistic <b>compliant</b> <b>layer</b> knees. The adhesion between compliant layers and a rigid backing have been investigated, with the aim of developing a good bond between them.

The scope of the analysis is restricted to Newtonian fluids, linear elasticity/viscoelasticity and equal roll speeds, with application to the industrially relevant highly loaded or 'negative gap' regime. Predictions are presented for coated film thickness, interroll thickness, meniscus location, pressure and layer deformation as the control parameters - load (gap), elasticity, layer thickness and capillary number, Ca - are varied. There are four main results: (i) Hookean spring models are shown to be unable to model effectively the deformation of a <b>compliant</b> <b>layer</b> when Poisson's ratio nu [...] > 0. 5. In particular, they fall to predict the swelling of the layer {{at the edge of the}} contact region which increases as v - 0. 5; they also fail to locate accurately the position of the meniscus, X-M, and to identify the presence, close to the meniscus, of a 'nib' (constriction in gap thickness) and associated magnification of the sub-ambient pressure loop. (ii) Scaling arguments suggest that layer thickness and elasticity may have similar effects on the field variables. It is shown that for positive gaps this is true, whereas for negative gaps they have similar effects on the pressure profile and flow rate yet quite different effects on layer swelling (deformation at the edge of the contact region) and different effects on X-M. (iii) For negative gaps and Ca similar to O(1), the effect of varying either viscosity or speed and hence Ca is to significantly alter both the coating thickness and X-M. This is contrary to the case of fixed-gap rigid roll coating. (iv) Comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental data shows quantitive agreement in the case of X-M and qualitive agreement for flow rate. It is shown that this difference in the latter case may be due to viscoelastic effects in the <b>compliant</b> <b>layer.</b> ...|$|E

An investigation of these processes and the quantification of the mechanical properties and structure of a biomaterial multilayer is determined. The multilayer was composed of an inner, aragonite-like layer and a middle, <b>compliant</b> <b>layer</b> with a gradient layer between the two exhibiting a non-uniform composition and structure. It was found that the hardness of the middle, <b>compliant</b> <b>layer</b> was 0. 186 ± 0. 007 GPa, while the inner, aragonite-like had a hardness of 2. 1 ± 0. 22 GPa. The hardness was found to be 1. 66 ± 0. 44 GPa within the gradient layer. The indentation toughness of the inner layer was found to be 0. 307 + 0. 097 MPa*m 1 / 2. It was also found that cracks propagated along the grain boundaries within the inner and gradient layers. Crack growth was thus driven by the separation of the grains. The formation of multiple cracks ahead of the crack tip suggested the formation of bands analogous to dilatation bands observed in nacre under certain stress-states. Thus, the mechanisms behind grain separation, the micro-architecture of the anisotropic aragonite grains and other constituents, and the gradual compositional change observed in the tougher gradient layer all acted as toughening mechanisms and contributed to overall property amplification of the shell. by Kevin Wheeler.

40|$|Examined here is {{the effect}} of fiber and {{interfacial}} layer morphologies on thermal fields in metal matrix composites (MMCs). A micromechanics model based on an arbitrarily layered concentric cylinder configuration is used to calculate thermal stress fields in MMCs subjected to spatially uniform temperature changes. The fiber is modelled as a layered material with isotropic or orthotropic elastic layers, whereas the surrounding matrix, including interfacial layers, is treated as a strain-hardening, elastoplastic, von Mises solid with temperature-dependent parameters. The solution to the boundary-value problem of an arbitrarily layered concentric cylinder under the prescribed thermal loading is obtained using the local/global stiffness matrix formulation originally developed for stress analysis of multilayered elastic media. Examples are provided that illustrate how the morphology of the SCS 6 silicon carbide fiber and the use of multiple <b>compliant</b> <b>layers</b> at the fiber/matrix interface affect the evolution of residual stresses in SiC/Ti composites during fabrication cool-down...|$|R
