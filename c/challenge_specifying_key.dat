In this paper, a simple range-queriable distributed data structure, called RAQ, is proposed to efficiently support exact match and range queries over multi-dimensional data. In RAQ, the key space is partitioned among the network with n nodes, in which each element has links to O(log n) other elements. We will show that the look-up query for a <b>specified</b> <b>key</b> can be done via O(log n) message passing. Also, RAQ handles range-queries in at most O(log n) communication steps. ...|$|R
