40|$|We {{consider}} the transition graphs of regular ground tree (or term) rewriting systems. The vertex set {{of such a}} graph is a (possibly infinite) set of trees. Thus, with a finite tree automaton one <b>can</b> represent a regular set of vertices. It is known that the backward closure of sets of vertices under the rewriting relation preserves regularity, i. e., for a regular set T of vertices the set of vertices from which one <b>can</b> reach <b>T</b> <b>can</b> be accepted by a tree automaton. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} to lift this result to the recurrence problem, i. e., we show that the set of vertices from which one <b>can</b> reach infinitely often a regular set T is regular, too. Since this result is effective, it implies that the problem whether, given a tree t and a regular set T, there is a path starting in t that infinitely often reaches T, is decidable. Furthermore, it is shown that the problems whether all paths starting in t eventually (respectively, infinitely often) reach T, are undecidable. Based on the decidability result we define a fragment of temporal logic with a decidable model-checking problem for the class of regular ground tree rewriting graphs...|$|R

40|$|Mast {{cells are}} not only {{important}} effector cells in immediate hypersensitivity reactions and immune responses to pathogens but also <b>can</b> contribute to <b>T</b> cell-mediated disorders. However, the mechanisms by which mast cells might influence T cells in such settings are not fully understood. We find that mast cells <b>can</b> enhance proliferation and cytokine production in multiple T cell subsets. Mast cell-dependent enhancement of <b>T</b> cell activation <b>can</b> be promoted by FcεRI-dependent mast cell activation, TNF production by both mast cells and T cells, and mast cell-T cell contact. However, at high concentrations of cells, mast cells <b>can</b> promote <b>T</b> cell activation independent of IgE or TNF. Finally, mast cells also <b>can</b> promote <b>T</b> cell activation by means of soluble factors.

40|$|The main {{question}} discussed in contemporary debates about personal identity is {{what to do}} with indeterminate cases – cases that is, where it appears indeterminate whether some person A at time t 1 is identical to a person B at time t 2. Some philosophers have argued that such cases are incurably indeterminate. I agree with these philosophers. However, they rarely, if ever, supplement their theories with an explicit explanation of why indeterminate cases keep popping up, and why they <b>can</b> <b>t</b> be solved (the focus has traditionally been on showing that they <b>can</b> <b>t</b> be solved). In this thesis, I try to answer the two whys. I do so by constructing a theory of personhood (or, at least, the framework for such a theory) in which persons are ontologically indeterminate. This makes it possible to claim that indeterminate cases simply mirror essential features of persons – which, in turn, explains why the cases <b>can</b> <b>t</b> be solved. In order to support the claim that persons are ontologically indeterminate I give a general theory of ontological indeterminacy. In that theory I show that ontological indeterminacy is a property mainly (possibly exclusively) instantiated by conceptual objects. I therefore argue that persons are conceptual objects (based partly on Searle s (1995) account of social phenomena). The result is a theoretical framework capable of handling and explaining many of the indeterminate cases that philosophers have traditionally struggled with. By the end of the thesis, I also show how the framework mashes well with empirical science, and how it turns some of the constitutive questions regarding persons into empirical questions about human psychology...|$|R
