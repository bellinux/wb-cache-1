50|$|In the United Kingdom, a Certificate of Life is {{termed a}} <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Existence.</b> When a UK {{resident}} is in receipt of a pension from a European country {{from time to}} time the pensioner may be required to complete a <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Existence</b> form. The pensioner must get the form stamped, dated and signed by an Electoral Officer at the pensioner's local authority. The completion process requires the pensioner to physically attend at the local authority office where he is resident with his/her passport or driving licence (as proof of identity) and a recent Council Tax bill (as proof of the pension's address in the Local Authority). No charge is levied by the local authority for stamping, dating and signing the <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Existence.</b>|$|E
50|$|A Certificate of Life (also {{called a}} Proof of Life, <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Existence</b> or Letter of Existence) is a {{certificate}} {{produced by a}} trusted entity to confirm that an individual is still alive.|$|E
50|$|Certificates of Existence are {{completed}} {{by a local}} authority {{because it is the}} arm of government which registers births, marriages and deaths of local residents and also manage the electoral register under the requirements of the Representation of the People Act 2000. No other party (e.g. a solicitor or notary) can purport to sign a <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Existence</b> since only the local authority has write-enabled access to UK death records and the electoral register.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper derives a {{differential}} contraction con-dition for the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> an orbitally-stable limit {{cycle in}} an au-tonomous system. This transverse contraction condition {{can be represented}} as a pointwise linear matrix inequality (LMI), thus allowing convex optimization tools such as sum-of-squares pro-gramming {{to be used to}} search for <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> a stable limit cycle. Many desirable properties of contracting dynamics are extended to this context, including preservation of contraction under a broad class of interconnections. In addition, by introducing the concepts of differential dissipativity and transverse differential dissipativity, contraction and transverse contraction can be established for large scale systems via LMI conditions on component subsystems.

40|$|We study amoebas of {{exponential}} sums as {{functions of}} the support set $A$. To any amoeba, we associate a set of approximating sections of amoebas, which we call caissons. We show that a bounded modular lattice of subspaces of a certain vector space induces a lattice structure {{on the set of}} caissons. Our results unifies the theories of lopsided amoebas and amoebas of exponential sums. As an application, we show that our theory of caissons yields improved <b>certificates</b> for <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> certain components of the complement of an amoeba.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{application}} of interpolants {{in the context}} of two-player games. Two-player games is a useful formalism for the synthesis of reactive systems, with applications in device driver development, hardware design, industrial automation, etc. In particular, we consider reachability games over a finite state space, where the first player (the controller) must force the game into a given goal region given any valid behaviour of the second player (the environment). A winning strategy for the controller is a mapping that associates with every state a controllable action to play in this state. To solve a game, the algorithm must (1) prove that there exists a winning strategy for the controller and (2) generate a concrete winning strategy. In this work we focus on the latter problem, which we refer to as strategy extraction. We address the strategy extraction problem {{in the context of}} a new counterexampleguided SAT-based algorithm for solving reachability games, recently proposed by Narodytska et al. [1]. If a strategy for the controller exists, the algorithm produces a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> strategy <b>existence</b> in the form of a game tree that specifies a set of moves of the controller at each round of the game. Figure 1 shows an example game tree produced by the algorithm. Each node of the tree correspond...|$|R

50|$|In the U.S. a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> {{incorporation}} {{is usually}} {{used as an}} alternative description of a corporation's articles <b>of</b> incorporation.
