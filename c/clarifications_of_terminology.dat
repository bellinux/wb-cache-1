40|$|Background: Corporate {{entrepreneurship}} (CE) {{is credited}} for many positive organisational outcomes, including systemic growth and increased revenue. Several terms associated with CE, including strategic renewal, corporate venturing and intrapreneurship are frequently used interchangeably and often confuse scholars, researchers and practitioners. The {{lack of clarity}} about the exact meaning of these terms is detrimental to the synergy in the current body of knowledge {{and the development of}} models involving these concepts. Objective: The aim of this paper was to describe CE as a unique concept, distinguishable from related concepts. Methodology: Several definitions of CE as well as the related terms were dissected, to identify core elements associated with each of them. The validity of these comprehensive definitions was tested by requesting 68 master’s degree students to classify the definitions. Inter-rater reliabilities were calculated in order to assess the level of agreement in the classification of the constructs. Results: The results indicate that CE is difficult to distinguish from strategic renewal and corporate venturing, but that intrapreneurship seems to be better defined and separate from the other constructs. Conclusion: These results emphasise the conceptual confusion that exists around CE and the need for further <b>clarification</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminology.</b> Graduate School <b>of</b> Business Leadership (SBL...|$|R

40|$|Research into opera audiences {{has taken}} up a {{predominance}} of emotion in opera lovers’ responses to opera, in particular, and music in general (including opera). For the field of music psychology, there has been increased interest in strong emotions in relation to music, physically manifested as, for example, chills, shivers down or up the spine, or an increase of the heart rate. Spiritual experiences feature among the range of strong emotions thus identified. It is on those that I focus in this article. Not only opera audiences report spiritual experiences: opera singers do so as well. Some contextual frameworks {{have been developed to}} explain such spiritual experiences, predominantly for audiences, but they are also relevant for singers. While the libretto is in many cases not likely to support the onset and development of spiritual experiences, some opera librettos might be argued to provide such support.

40|$|PURPOSE – The paper {{addresses}} the importance <b>of</b> clarifying <b>terminology</b> such as visually impaired and related terms before embarking on accessibility studies of electronic information resources in library contexts. Apart from briefly defining accessibility, the paper attempts {{to address the}} lack of in-depth definitions of terms such as visually impaired, blind, partially sighted, etc. that has been noted in the literature indexed by two major Library and Information Science (LIS) databases. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to offer a basis for selecting participants in studies of accessibility of electronic information resources in library contexts and to put discussions of such studies in context. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH – <b>Clarification</b> <b>of</b> concepts concerning visual impairment following a literature survey based on searching two major databases in LIS. To put the discussion in context accessibility is also briefly defined. FINDINGS – Although visually impaired and a variety of related terms such as blind, partially sighted, visually disabled, etc. are used in the LIS literature, hardly any attempt is made to define these terms in depth. This can be a serious limitation in web and electronic accessibility evaluations and the selection of participants. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS – Clearly distinguishing between categories of visually impaired people and the ability of sight of participants is important when selecting participants for studies on accessibility for visually impaired people, e. g. the accessibility evaluation of web sites, digital libraries and other electronic information resources. ORIGINALITY/VALUE – The paper can make a contribution to the <b>clarification</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminology</b> essential for the selection of participants in accessibility studies, as well as enriching the literature on accessibility for visually impaired people in the context of LIS.

This paper presents an analysis of over 90 terms identified in literature from the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand reporting types of housing with services {{under the umbrella of}} ‘service integrated housing’ (SIH), defined as all forms of accommodation built specifically for older people in which the housing provider takes responsibility for delivery of one or more types of support and care services. A small number of generic terms covering housing for people in later life, home and community care, and institutional care are reviewed first to define the scope of SIH. Review of the remainder identifies different terms applied to similar types of SIH, similar terms applied to different types, and different terms that distinguish different types. Terms are grouped into those covering SIH focused on lifestyle and recreation, those offering only support services, and those offering care as well as support.

This {{research}} was undertaken from an ecosystemic perspective and {{aimed to explore}} how male adolescents from diverse racial and cultural groups experienced violence in an urban, private, secondary school in KwaZulu-Natal. The {{first part of the}} dissertation consists of a brief introductory overview of the study incorporating background and aim of the research, problem statement, <b>clarification</b> <b>of</b> <b>terminology,</b> research methodology and course of study. A comprehensive literature review, encompassing detailed explanations of the ecosystemic perspective, incorporates a study of violence and its multiple facets, components and interacting contributory systems. Furthermore, a specific rationalization of South African violence and male adolescent violence in South African secondary schools is analytically unpacked. In line with the researcher's epistemology, the methodology utilised was qualitative in nature and the phenomenological interview technique was employed to explore the experiences of male adolescents between the ages of 13 and 19 years. The responses of the participants were subjected to a thematic analysis. The imperative themes that emerged from the data analysis procedure are outlined in the results chapter and it is apparent from the responses of the participants that issues of masculinity, gender-role socialisation, male identity formation and peer pressure are significant contributory factors influencing the prevalence of violence in South African secondary schools. The results are therefore discussed with reference to the literature review and expressly associated with the South African context. Finally a conclusion is offered together with reflections of the researcher and recommendations for educators...|$|R

The aim of the research was to conduct a literature study in attempt to identify and confirm all variables and moderators of IC, to utilize this knowledge to develop an assessment methodology and framework, and to assess the status of IC within the South African context and the feasibility of the proposed model and methodology, through the use of focus groups.
