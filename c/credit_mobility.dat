40|$|AbstractIncentives are {{effective}} tools when {{people should be}} encouraged to change their behavior. This is also true for travel behavior. Adopted from the incentive system that was included in the flexible mechanism of the Kyoto protocol for pollutant emissions based on “green certificates”, the <b>Mobility</b> <b>Credit</b> system in Bologna rewards people for sustainable travel behavior. Going by bike, public transport or using car sharing/pooling instead of taking the private car will be rewarded with a complementary amount of mobility eco savings (<b>mobility</b> <b>credits).</b> These credits can be used to get environmental/energy benefits such as a free bus ticket. This incentive system should help to convince people to consider alternatives to the private car and start to develop their mind set towards more multimodal thinking. The measure so-called “MobiMart” is conducted as a pilot test within CIVITAS MIMOSA, a European project co-funded by EC. It aims at designing, prototyping and demonstrating a model for measure mobility eco-savings coming from different instruments, both at citizen and community level. The challenge is to implement a widely acceptable certification method for mileage savings, resource use, emissions reduction, etc. Conversion criteria and trading rules, validated protocols and guidelines about <b>mobility</b> <b>credits</b> issuing and voluntary agreements between key stakeholders for mutual recognition of transport related <b>mobility</b> <b>credits</b> will be implemented.

40|$|Background: University {{students}} who complete study abroad experiences are potentially exposed to behaviors, in particular {{alcohol and drug}} use, that place their health at risk. There {{is a need to}} identify risk and protective factors and highlight knowledge gaps. Methods: A systematic review adopting the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology. Relevant bibliographic databases and online repositorieswere systematically searched for both qualitative and quantitative peer-reviewed studies. Results: Eighteen articles were eligible for inclusion. Degree mobility students (DMSs—students pursuing a full bachelor or master degree in a foreign country) and <b>Credit</b> <b>Mobility</b> Students (CMSs—students participating in short term or semester study abroad programmes) show different patterns of at-risk behaviors compared to pre-departure, and to domestic or non-study abroad students.

40|$|Abstract Research on {{internationalisation}} {{of higher}} education {{with a focus on}} the area of student mobility have examined mostly the movement of students from developing to developed countries. In recent years, this traditional flow of students has shifted from one where countries which were usually conceived as only senders have become receivers of international students. Although countries in Latin America are receiving more students year by year, few research has been conducted to identify the motivations which drive them to study in this region. This country-specific study aims at exploring two phenomena: 1) the drivers of inbound <b>credit</b> <b>mobility</b> in Colombia and 2) the experiences of international students during their study abroad period. An online survey was applied to collect data from students at universities throughout Colombia and a descriptive apporach was used to analyse quantitative and qualitative data. An adaptated push-pull model was used as the theoretical framework to investigate student mobility. The findings suggest that the most influential rationales behind students’ choice of Colombia as a study abroad destination are related to personal and career development factors. In regard to personal drivers, students coming to this country were pulled by desire to broaden their cultural horizons by appreciating the Colombian cultural diversity and {{to know more about the}} Latin American region. As for career development motivations, students sought to gain skills to work in a globalised labour market and to improve their future career prospects. The results of this study show that students’ experiences in the country are positive despite the several negative aspects that affected their stay in the country. This study is the first endeavour addressing international inbound student mobility in Colombia. It seeks to contribute to the production of scientific literature regarding academic mobility in the Latin American region and to provide policy makers and higher education administrators with valuable information to better understand why are foreigners interested in spending a period of study in Colombia, so that both the government and the institutions improve their strategies to attract more students in the future...|$|E

Three alternative mainstream monetary policy regimes are considered: i) a flexible exchange rate regime; ii) a crawling peg; and iii) a money growth target. The results show that the macroeconomic responses to these monetary policy regimes, depends on other auxiliary polices of the central bank, such as; sterilization policy, foreign reserve accumulation policy and openmarket operations. In particular, we find that a flexible exchange rate regime with full domestic absorption delivers the highest level of aggregate employment, though with higher volatility for other macroeconomic variables. The other policy rules deliver lower macroeconomic volatility but at the cost of crowding-out the private sector, depending on the mix of open-market operations.

On the other hand, I find that 44 percent of shocks are smoothed via foreign aid from France, and 5 percent via central bank contributions, while reserves pooling provides no shock smoothing. For the WAEMU, I find that only 13 percent of shocks are smoothed through the standard channels, while 63 percent are smoothed via foreign aid from France, 7 percent via central bank contributions, and no smoothing via reserves pooling. I compare these results with the risksharing pattern in the Unites States.

40|$|With 2586 km 2, Luxembourg is the 7 th European {{smallest}} {{country in}} Europe. Despite its small size {{this country is}} facing important mobility challenges. Out of the 380 000 available jobs in the country, nearly 43 % of them are occupied by cross borders workers. These 165 000 cross borders traveling every day from France, Belgium and Germany generate an important pressure on the transport infrastructures. Because 89 % of the cross-borders workers and 74 % of the resident workers commute by car, the road system, at peak hours, reaches saturation. In order to decrease the pressure (in term of commuting flow, residential prices, etc.) on Luxembourg City and to reach a more balanced polycentric development across the country the development of Belval has been decided by the government. This new-town which is located 20 km south-west of Luxembourg-City will attract economic activity and residential units. The University of Luxembourg {{will be one of}} institutions relocating most of its infrastructure in Belval. Without any doubts, this workplace relocation will greatly affect the University staff commuting mobility. In accordance to any public institution or large enterprise in this country, the University is more and more committed to reduce the carbon footprint related to the staff and students commuting behavior. The MODU (national sustainable mobility strategy) defines strong modal split objectives and the number of parking spaces available for the university on Belval site will rely on this national objective. So far, few scientific contributions analyzed the accessibility variation for car and Public Transport (PT) on important worker’s’ population considering relocation actions of this size. GIS tools and visualization techniques will permit to quantify the car and public transport accessibility vari ation due to the University move to Belval. The scientific contribution of this article lies in the relation between the car & PT accessibility and the development of Travel Demand Management (TDM) measures. Indeed, an innovative Parking Management Scheme (PMS) integrating car & PT accessibility to the new campus as well as carpooling use among the staff members will be presented. Our aim is to develop a <b>mobility</b> <b>credit</b> scheme system where users could use points to park their car or use the public transport system. Soft modes might collect additional points that could serve to get gifts or even cash back. Indeed, the objective is to reach a pragmatic parking policy that lead Single Occupancy Vehicle (SOV) to shift, first, to soft modes, then, to public transport and finally to carpooling. The key is the relation between the different travel modes and their existing incentives or disincentives. This approach might help other major private or public institutions to define optimum subsidy strategies regarding their parking and staff’s public seasonal ticket costs...|$|R
40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{has been}} placing an extremely high {{burden on the}} development of modern cities. Congestion can be alleviated by either increasing road capacity, or by reducing traffic demand. For decades, increasing capacity by building more roads and lanes has been the major solution applied to accommodate the ever-growing traffic demand. However, {{it turns out to be}} of limited effect due to some well-known phenomenon such as latent demand. Controlling and managing traffic demand has in turn been viewed as a cost-effective alternative to increasing road capacity, as has been demonstrated many successful applications all around the world. Within the concept framework of Traffic Demand Management (TDM), Active Transportation and Demand Management (ATDM) is the dynamic management, control, and influence of traffic demand and traffic flow of transportation facilities. ATDM strategies attempt to influence traveler behavior and further manage traffic flow in a time-dependent manner within the existing infrastructure Successful ATDM applications include congestion pricing, adaptive ramp metering, dynamic speed limits, dynamic lane use control, etc. Singapore stands out to be an excellent success story of ATDM, as the implementations of "Cap and Trade" license plates and electronic road pricing make motoring a high cost privilege for citizens of Singapore, making the public relies on transit. Monetary leverage is an effective instrument to facilitate ATDM. Examples of ATDM applications adopting monetary instrument includes dynamic congestion pricing, "Cap and Trade" of car licenses, etc. Taking congestion pricing as an example, policy makers are inducing travelers' behavior and alternating their preferences towards different behavior decisions by levying price tags to different choices. As an important underpinning of rationing choice theory, an individual assigns an ordinal number over the available actions and this ordinal number is calculated by their utility function or payoff function. The individual's preference is expressed as the relationship between those ordinal assignments. In the implementation of congestion pricing, policy makers are imposing an additional high disutility to congested roads and therefore pushing some of the travelers to take alternative routes or shift to alternative departure times or even cancel the trips. However, congestion pricing suffers from public aversion as it creates burden on the motoring of low-income people and therefore doesn't help to alleviate social inequality. The concept of Tradable <b>Mobility</b> <b>Credit</b> (TMC) has been proposed by a group of researchers as another innovative application to facilitate dynamic traffic demand management and solve social inequality issues using pricing instruments. The concept of TMC is borrowed from carbon trading in environmental control. A limited quota of personal auto usage is issued to eligible travelers and credits can be traded in a free market fashion. This guarantees that the roadway usage does not exceed capacity while avoiding the negative effects of shortages normally associated with quotation systems. TMC is literally not a market-ready policy as the integration of the supporting infrastructures, including the trading market, the credit assignment component, and the credit charging component, has not been fully explored yet. Existing TMC research focuses on explaining and exploring the equilibrium condition through analytical methods such as mathematical modeling. Analytical models produce perfect convergence curves and deterministic equilibrium traffic flow patterns. Analytical models provide influential guidance for further works but the solution procedure may encounter problems when dealing with larger real world networks and scenarios. Meantime, current analytical models don't consider the microstructure of the credit trading market sufficiently while it's actually the most unique component of TMC system. Motivated by those concerns, an integrated TMC evaluation platform consisting of a policy making module and traveler behavior modules are proposed in this research. The concept of Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) is extensively adopted in this integrated platform as each individual traveler carries his/her personal memory across iterations. The goal of establishing this framework is to better predict a traveler's route choice and trading behavior if TMC is imposed and further provide intelligence to potential policy makers' decision making process. The proposed integrated platform is able to generate results at different aggregation levels, including both individual level microscopic behavior data as well as aggregated traffic flow and market performance data. In order to calibrate the proposed integrated platform, an online interactive experiment is designed based on an experimental economic package and a human research element with 22 participants has been conducted on this experiment platform to gather field data regarding a real person's route choice behavior and credit trading behavior in an artificial TMC system. Participants are recruited from forum, listserve, social media, etc. The calibrated platform is proved to have the ability to predict travelers' behavior accurately. A prototype market microstructure is proposed in this research as well and it is proved to be a cost-effective setting and resulted to a vast amount of economic saving given the fact that travelers would behave similar to the prediction generated by traveler behavior module. It's also demonstrated that the principle of Pareto-improving is not achieved in the proposed ABMS models...|$|R
