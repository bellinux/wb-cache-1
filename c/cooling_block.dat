40|$|A new {{experimental}} technique, {{extended from}} similar work on dry materials, is presented {{for measuring the}} in-plane components of the relative diffusivity tensor for partially saturated porous media. The method utilizes a custom-built holder and measures the transient response to oxygen concentration changes at the boundaries of a porous sample placed between two plates surrounded by a <b>cooling</b> <b>block.</b> The apparatus is kept close to the freezing temperature of water to ensure stable saturation throughout the experiment. Fick's second law is used to fit the transient change in concentration to a numerical solution to obtain the diffusion coefficient for samples of differing saturation. As expected the effective gas diffusivity is found to decrease with increasing water saturation of the media as the porosity is reduced and the tortuosity of the diffusion pathways increased. After extensive validation, this new technique is {{used to determine the}} relative in-plane diffusivity of some common fuel cell gas diffusion layer materials.

"Thesis supervisor: Dr. Hongbin Ma. [ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] With ever increasing technological advances in electronics, modern computer components continue to produce higher power densities that present a challenge to thermal management. A radial flat-plate oscillating heat pipe (RFP-OHP) heat spreader is investigated to study the effect of central heating on the heat transport capability in an OHP. The investigated OHP has dimensions of 100 mm x 100 mm x 2. 5 mm with central heating using a 30 mm x 30 mm heater. Experimental results show that when heat {{is added to the}} center section of one side of the radial flat-plate OHP, and when heat is removed from the whole surface of another side of the heat pipe, the startup power for the oscillating motion increases. In addition, the spacer effect on the heat transport capability including the startup is investigated experimentally. The spacer added between the <b>cooling</b> <b>block</b> and OHP could lower the startup power for oscillatory motion. When compared to a copper slab of the same dimensions in the same test configuration, the temperature difference for the OHP with and without the additional copper spacer was reduced by a maximum of 46 and 25 %, respectively, at a power input of 525 W and a heat flux of 58 W/cm².

40|$|In {{permanent}} mold casting, die design for cast aluminium alloy and magnesium alloy products includes {{a number of}} high conductivity material cooling blocks (also called channels or cooling circuits) that are aimed to extract heat away from molten metal through direct conduction heat transfer and freeze the casting {{as quickly as possible}} in a directional manner. One of the biggest problems during this solidification process occurs when the molten metal naturally shrinks away from the mould as it solidifies. This makes it increasingly difficult to efficiently and effectively cool targeted areas in the casting through conduction, since the direct contact between the solidifying casting and the <b>cooling</b> <b>block</b> is significantly reduced or even lost. A typical <b>cooling</b> <b>block</b> (termed in this thesis as a “chill”) is a cooling circuit that is embedded in a {{permanent mold}} (or die) and positioned to enable high heat transfer (effective cooling) to a targeted large section in the casting. If a large volume section in a casting does not cool efficiently and in the correct sequence in the overall product (i. e. solidification first in the furthest part from the sprue inlet followed by successive and ordered solidification towards the sprue inlet, until finally the sprue inlet itself), then it will create a “hot spot” which will create macro-shrinkage in the casting. This can create millions of dollars of waste in terms of casting rejects, lost productivity, and reworks for a given manufacturing company. When the molten metal solidifies, it shrinks by about 6. 6 % for aluminium alloys and 4. 0 % for magnesium alloys. This creates an air gap at the casting and mold interface. This air gap causes inefficient, random and isolated pockets of heat transfer from the casting to a contacting chill, which in turn causes a significant variation in the temperature distribution in the casting and die during solidification. A die operating in an incorrect and unstable temperature band will very likely produce adverse secondary effects in the final product such as macro shrinkage, micro shrinkage, hot tearing, gas porosity, or even misruns. This aim {{of this study is to}} theoretically understand and experimentally develop a cooling technique that can offset or close up the growing air gap and maintain high heat transfer between the casting and contacting chill, by ensuring that the chill is pushed closer into the casting at specific times during the solidification (and shrinking) process. A movable copper chill was designed and built to push forward into an insulated mold. The experiments were carried out using commercially available A 356 aluminium alloy. The chill was pushed into the casting as it solidified in the mold. Studies were carried out to understand the effect of a movable chill with different cooling conditions compared to a fixed chill. Numerical simulations were conducted using developed boundary conditions in a commercial casting solidification package(ProCASTTM). The boundary condition used to emulate the air gap is a temporally distributed interfacial heat transfer coefficient function between the casting and chill and this is manually calculated using inverse modelling in an in-house developed optimisation package (OPTCASTTM) to compare and validate with experimental data. The resulting sensitivities of the casting due to different chill conditions (i. e. fixed vs. moving) are described through physical phenomenon, metallographic analysis and computational modelling. Results show that the effective cooling can be increased by 39. 2 % by using movable chill with cooling compared to fixed chill with cooling. The percentage of complete contact between the casting and chill has been increased from 10 % in case of fixed chill with cooling to 76 % in case of movable chill with cooling. Apart from effectiveness of cooling, the quality of casting produced with new cooling technique has significantly improved. The secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) of the casting produced under the movable chill have be reduced by 26 % compared to fixed chill...|$|E
40|$|We present here an {{alternative}} thermal {{design for the}} wheels of the ATLAS SCT End-Caps. We achieve 30 % savings on the overall thickness compared to the final baseline design presented in the Forward SCT Cooling Review (October 1999). Compared with the thickness contribution of the wiggly pipe system of the baseline design, the savings amount to about 75 % of the cooling system components. Savings are mainly obtained by the efficient use of new materials and by eliminating the <b>cooling</b> points, <b>blocks</b> and pipes from the ends of the modules, opposite to the hybrid circuits. Further benefits are obtained by routing the cooling pipes circumferentially rather than radially through the <b>cooling</b> <b>blocks,</b> thus shortening the pipes by a factor of ~ 3. The simplicity of the proposed design offers improved reliability, and will reduce production time and cost. This report includes extensive thermal calculations. Several techniques involved in using new materials to optimise the thermal performance are demonstrated. Based on our calculations and measurements, we present a complete wheel design.

40|$|A chip’s {{operating}} temperature {{is emerging as}} a major design constraint. Floorplanning is an effective technique that helps spread heat and minimize the occurrence of localized hotspots. The floorplanning process may place two communicating microarchitectural blocks (for example, the issue queue and ALU) far apart {{in an attempt to}} surround hot <b>blocks</b> with relatively <b>cooler</b> <b>blocks.</b> As we move to future wire-bound technologies, multiple pipeline stages may be required for the communication of signals between blocks that are placed far apart. This paper provides a detailed characterization of how these wire delays impact performance. Such data can serve as useful inputs to floorplanning algorithms so that performance-critical wire delays can be minimized. Routing and placement tools can also exploit this information by implementing low-power wires for the transmission of non-critical signals. In this work, we show that wire delays between the ALU and L 1 data cache are most critical to performance, while most other wire delays degrade performance by less than 5 % even if they consume up to four cycles. Our results are incorporated in a floorplanning tool and the generated floorplans perform up to 24 % better than a floorplanner that does not take such information into account...|$|R
