Previous work investigated efficient protocols for peer-to-peer (P 2 P) dissemination in social overlays, but also showed that the churn induced by users, combined with the topology constraints posed by these overlays, may yield unacceptable latency. In this paper, we combine P 2 P dissemination on the social overlay with occasional access to the cloud. When updates from a friend are not received for a long time, the cloud serves as an external channel to verify their presence. The latter acts as an external channel to check for friend updates, when these are not received for a long time. The outcome is disseminated in a P 2 P fashion, quenching cloud access from other nodes and, if an update exists, speeding dissemination. We show that our protocol performs close to mainstream <b>centralized</b> <b>architectures</b> and incurs only modest monetary costs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Four {{different}} {{multi-agent system}} architectures for a {{dynamic resource allocation}} problem are presented and evaluated. Although all the architectures use three types of agents, i. e., quantifiers that act on the behalf the providers, allocators that act on the behalf of the customers, and distributors that decide how the available resources should be divided between the customers, they differ {{with respect to the}} degree of distribution of control and the degree of synchronization. The architectures are evaluated through simulation experiments concerning load balancing and overload control of Intelligent Networks. A number of aspects are compared, e. g., how fast the system re-allocates the resources when there are sudden changes in demand, how well the load is balanced between the providers, how well the resources are utilized, how fast a customer gets response, how fairly the system treats the customers, how robust the system is, and the amount of communication overhead. Some of the conclusions are that the asynchronous architectures react faster and that the <b>centralized</b> <b>architectures</b> balance the load better. On the other hand, the <b>centralized</b> <b>architectures</b> have a single point of failure and the asynchronous architectures tend to use more communication overhead. ...|$|R

30|$|As for {{the network}} load’s {{comparative}} performance measurements, we observed linear growth patterns for both the centralized and the distributed architectures, with a smaller change rate (slope) for the <b>centralized</b> <b>architecture</b> {{with respect to the}} distributed one. In fact, for discovery of resources related to 10 PIPs, the network load generated in the distributed architecture was 868.9 KB, vs. 197.4 KB generated in the <b>centralized</b> <b>architecture</b> for the same scenario – i.e. a performance improvement of 77.3 %. We also noticed that the generated network load for the case of 1 PIP is higher in the distributed architecture, when compared to the centralized one. This {{is due to the fact}} that, in the <b>centralized</b> <b>architecture,</b> the intermediary broker node performs an initial selection operation, in order to return the most relevant resources (satisfying functional requirements and constraints on dynamic attributes), which results in a more refined resources list and thus a reduction in the size of the resources’ description document returned to the VIP. In the distributed scenario case, since the selection is performed by the VIP, the PIP only performs a simple matching operation (based on functional attributes only), thus returning a less refined and larger list of resources to the VIP.|$|E

In contrast to previous systems, SWORD allows users to describe desired resources as a topology of interconnected groups with required intragroup, intergroup, and per-node characteristics, along with the utility that the application derives from specified ranges of metric values. This design gives users the flexibility to find geographically distributed resources for applications that are sensitive to both node and network characteristics, and allows the system to rank acceptable configurations based on their quality for that application. Rather than evaluating a single implementation of SWORD, we explore a variety of architectural designs that deliver the required functionality in a scalable and highly available manner. We discuss the trade-offs of using a <b>centralized</b> <b>architecture</b> as compared to a fully decentralized design to perform wide-area resource discovery.
