5|$|The Baptism of Christ– portrays Jesus with John the Baptist at the River Jordan. Mottled {{glass is}} used for the area around the water, with a layer of wavy glass over Christ's left foot to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> looking through water.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} portray the {{characters}} underwater, the actors wore Heelys wheeled footwear, which simulate the gliding action of swimming creatures. The actors playing Ariel and the other merfolk had wire-frame tails attached to their hips. Subsequent productions feature different designs for Ariel and the merfolk; the Dutch and Japanese productions use wirework and aerial stunts to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> underwater swimming.|$|E
5|$|Art Director Roger Christian used {{scrap metal}} and parts to create set pieces and props to save money, a {{technique}} he employed {{while working on}} Star Wars. For example, some of the Nostromo corridors were created from portions of scrapped bomber aircraft, and a mirror was used to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> longer corridors in the below-deck area. Special effects supervisors Brian Johnson and Nick Allder made many of the set pieces and props function, including moving chairs, computer monitors, motion trackers, and flamethrowers.|$|E

50|$|The poem {{goes on to}} {{describe}} how Manannan defended the island by magic, by conjuring up mists and <b>creating</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> a defending army. In Manx Fairy Tales (1911), this theme is developed into Manannan <b>creating</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> a fleet against the Viking invaders.|$|R

5|$|Glimmer and Taxable {{were very}} similar operations. They were {{executed}} {{in the early hours}} of 6 June 1944 whilst the invasion fleet was approaching Normandy. Taxable simulated an invasion force approaching Cap d'Antifer and Glimmer threatened Pas-de-Calais. By dropping chaff in progressive patterns, Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers were able to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> a large fleet on coastal radar screens. Beneath the chaff, small boats towed radar reflector balloons and simulated the radio traffic expected of a large fleet. Once German forces were drawn to the coast, it was planned that the RAF would attempt to contain them in this region, and away from Normandy, by bombing bridges and roads.|$|E
5|$|The main {{mechanisms}} {{to create the}} resemblances described by Poulton – whether in nature or in military applications – are crypsis, blending into the background so as to become hard to see (this covers both special and general resemblance); disruptive patterning, using colour and pattern {{to break up the}} animal's outline, which relates mainly to general resemblance; mimesis, resembling other objects of no special interest to the observer, which relates to special resemblance; countershading, using graded colour to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> flatness, which relates mainly to general resemblance; and counterillumination, producing light to match the background, notably in some species of squid.|$|E
5|$|Time is also {{connected}} {{to the theme of}} light and dark. In Shakespeare's day, plays were most often performed at noon or in the afternoon in broad daylight. This forced the playwright to use words to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> day and night in his plays. Shakespeare uses references to the night and day, the stars, the moon, and the sun to create this illusion. He also has characters frequently refer to days of the week and specific hours to help the audience understand that time has passed in the story. All in all, no fewer than 103 references to time are found in the play, adding to the illusion of its passage.|$|E

5|$|Tombaugh's {{task was}} to {{systematically}} image the night sky in pairs of photographs, then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position. Using a blink comparator, he rapidly shifted {{back and forth between}} views of each of the plates to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs. On February 18, 1930, after nearly a year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates taken on January 23 and 29. A lesser-quality photograph taken on January 21 helped confirm the movement. After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930.|$|E
5|$|Andersen's {{auditors}} were {{pressured by}} Enron's management to defer recognizing the charges {{from the special}} purpose entities as its credit risks became known. Since the entities would never return a profit, accounting guidelines required that Enron should take a write-off, where {{the value of the}} entity was removed from the balance sheet at a loss. To pressure Andersen into meeting Enron's earnings expectations, Enron would occasionally allow accounting companies Ernst & Young or PricewaterhouseCoopers to complete accounting tasks to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> hiring a new company to replace Andersen. Although Andersen was equipped with internal controls to protect against conflicted incentives of local partners, it failed to prevent conflict of interest. In one case, Andersen's Houston office, which performed the Enron audit, was able to overrule any critical reviews of Enron's accounting decisions by Andersen's Chicago partner. In addition, after news of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations of Enron were made public, Andersen would later shred several tons of relevant documents and delete nearly 30,000 e-mails and computer files, causing accusations of a cover-up.|$|E

25|$|To <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> movement, {{an image}} is {{displayed}} {{on the computer screen}} then quickly replaced by a new image that is similar to the previous image, but shifted slightly.

25|$|In {{addition}} to physical jobs, women {{were also asked}} to cut back and ration. Silk and nylon were used for the war efforts, creating a shortage of stockings. Many women actually painted lines down the back of their legs to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> wearing the fashionable stockings of the time.|$|E
25|$|Regular {{exercise}} of the muscles and fibres of the pectoral complex, which lies just under the fatty tissues of the breast, helps prevent droopiness can <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> larger and firmer breasts and an enhanced cleavage. Weight training, use of exercise machines, push ups and chest presses are considered helpful, {{as well as a}} number of other exercises, including rowing and basketball. In some form of exercise, breasts unsupported by a sports bra are exposed to greater risk of droopiness.|$|E
25|$|Steve McQueen's {{likeness}} as Frank Bullitt {{was used}} in two Ford commercials. The first was for the Europe-only 1997 Ford Puma, which featured a special effects montage of McQueen (who died in 1980) driving a new Puma around San Francisco before parking it in a studio apartment garage beside the film Mustang and the motorcycle from The Great Escape. In a 2004 commercial for the 2005 Mustang, special effects are again used to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> McQueen driving the new Mustang, after a man receives a Field of Dreams-style epiphany and constructs a racetrack {{in the middle of}} a cornfield.|$|E

25|$|Paints {{were made}} from animal, {{vegetable}} and mineral pigments and bases. Most paintings focus one or more human figures, which may be realistic or stylized, masculine, feminine or asexual. They may be naked or richly attired, but the social status of each figure is indicated in some way. Scenes often depict war, sacrifice, {{the roles of the}} gods or the acts of nobles. However, some common scenes with common people have been found as well. Other subjects included gods, symbols and animals. Mesoamerican painting was bi-dimensional with no efforts to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> depth. However, movement is often represented.|$|E
25|$|Barks {{initially}} {{worked as}} an inbetweener. This involved being teamed and supervised {{by one of the}} head animators who did the key poses of character action (often known as extremes) for which the inbetweeners did the drawings between the extremes to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> movement. While an inbetweener, Barks submitted gag ideas for cartoon story lines being developed and showed such a knack for creating comical situations that by 1937 he was transferred to the story department. His first story sale was the climax of Modern Inventions, for a sequence where a robot barber chair gives Donald Duck a haircut on his bottom.|$|E
25|$|Cézanne syntax didn't just ripple {{outwards}} {{over the}} sphere, touching those {{that would become}} Cubists in France, Futurists in Italy and Die Brücke, Der Blaue Reiter, Expressionists in Germany, it also created currents that flowed throughout Parisian art world threatening to destabilize (if not topple) {{at least three of}} the core foundations of the academia: the geometrical method of perspective used to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> form, space and depth since the Renaissance; Figuratism, derived from real object sources (and therefore representational), and aesthetics. At the time, it was assumed that all art aims at beauty, and anything that wasn't beautiful couldn't be counted as art. The proto-Cubists revolted against the concept that objective beauty was central to the definition of art.|$|E
