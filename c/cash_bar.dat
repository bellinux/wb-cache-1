2500|$|Launched in 2008, Pets was Tagged's {{first game}} and, as of May 2011, {{remains the most}} popular. Similar to a fantasy sports league, players use virtual cash to [...] "buy" [...] others and own them like pets, then barter them with other players or sell at a set price. Virtual cash can be earned by players in several ways, such as {{frequently}} logging into Tagged, converting Tagged gold at the Pets <b>Cash</b> <b>Bar</b> into Pets Cash and using real money.|$|E
5000|$|... a <b>cash</b> <b>bar</b> (a.k.a. a no-host bar): Attendees pay {{for their}} own drinks.|$|E
50|$|Another such {{factor is}} cost. A <b>cash</b> <b>bar</b> {{is the least}} {{expensive}} option for a host. However, there are alternatives between a <b>cash</b> <b>bar</b> and a fully open bar that can limit costs. The host can set a hard limit on cost, beyond which all beverages {{have to be paid}} for by attendees. The host can specify that specific beverages, such as a few selected types of wines and beers, {{are paid for by the}} host, and that attendees pay for all other types of drinks. The host can set a time limit for an open bar, beyond which it reverts to being a <b>cash</b> <b>bar.</b> Or more complex combinations of these can be employed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cash</b> <b>bars</b> {{have their}} {{problems}} for caterers and venue managers. One major {{problem is the}} possibility of theft. To prevent this, managers can set up cashiers, who take money and issue drinks tickets, separate from the serving staff who actually serve drinks. Brown and Godsmark recommend to managers that they place only their most trustworthy staff in charge of the <b>cash</b> <b>bars</b> at banquets.|$|R
5000|$|A {{certified}} check or certified cheque {{is a form}} of cheque for which the bank verifies that sufficient funds exist in the account to cover the cheque, and so certifies, at the time the cheque is written. Those funds are then set aside in the bank's internal account until the cheque is cashed or returned by the payee. Thus, a certified cheque cannot be stopped (can't [...] "bounce"), and, in this manner, its liquidity is similar to <b>cash,</b> <b>barring</b> bank failure or illegal act (such as the funds being based on a fraudulent loan, at which point the cheque will be disavowed).|$|R
50|$|Providence Anime Conference was {{announced}} at Anime Boston 2007 with a 21-and-older age requirement and programing geared towards mature fans. The convention estimated that attendance {{would be in}} the thousands for the first year, and instituted a 2000-attendee cap, but only registered 211 paid attendees. Problems with the convention included a remote convention location, an expensive convention center with limited public transportation, the 21-and-older age requirement, and no one-day passes. At times, the convention's halls were empty due to heavy panel attendance and the dealers suffered due to the frugality of the attendees. Positives included <b>cash</b> <b>bars</b> selling alcoholic beverages, the use of adult language, and full panel rooms with good Q&A's and discussions. The low attendance caused the convention to lose money and not return for the immediate future.|$|R

In April and May 1945, the remaining reserves of the Reichsbank - gold (730 <b>bars),</b> <b>cash</b> (6 large sacks), and precious stones and metals such as platinum (25 sealed boxes) - were dispatched by Walther Funk to be buried on the Klausenhof Mountain at Einsiedl in Bavaria, where the final German resistance was to be concentrated.

5000|$|Guests {{should not}} be {{expected}} to wait {{for an extended period of}} time between the ceremony and reception, and should be fed a meal if the reception and/or ceremony is during normal meal times. However, while hosts must supply beverages of some sort, they are considered under no obligation to provide alcohol. Those who do so are obliged to provide neither unlimited nor specific types of alcohol. Cash bars are considered inappropriate by etiquette writers, on the grounds that it is inappropriate to ask guests to pay for anything and because [...] "true hospitality shares what it has. It does not attempt to give what it has not." [...] While commonly seen in reception rooms, a <b>cash</b> <b>bar</b> indicates that the host believes the guests should have access to drinks, but is not willing to pay for them. Judith Martin suggests that if one cannot afford to serve liquor at the reception, [...] "... serve tea or punch. If you can't afford that, serve water. But serve it graciously." ...|$|E
50|$|Dance bar is a {{term used}} in India to refer to bars in which adult {{entertainment}} {{in the form of}} dances by relatively well-covered women are performed for male patrons in exchange for <b>cash.</b> Dance <b>bars</b> used to be present only in Maharashtra, but later spread across the country, mainly in cities. Dance bars were banned in the state of Maharashtra, in August 2005, with the passing of the Maharashtra Police (Amendment) Act, 2005. Subsequently, the government shut down dance bars. However, many continued to flourish as late as 2011, although in a clandestine way in Mumbai and its outskirts. Mumbai alone had 700 dance bars, at their peak in April 2005 when it was banned, though officially only 307 dance bars existed, the rest were illegal, while the figures for rest of the state was 650 dance bars in total. In all they employed 150,000 people, including 75,000 bar girls. These bars functioned as fronts for prostitution. After the ban was enforced, no rehabilitation program was initiated for the nightclub dancers, known as bar-balas. Many moved to Dubai and other Middle Eastern countries, while others went to New Delhi, Chennai and Hyderabad.|$|R

5000|$|The series {{follows the}} protagonists as they hunt down the cursed antiques, {{which are usually}} in the {{possession}} of people who have discovered their magic powers and are unwilling to give them up. In some cases the object is {{in the possession of}} the one who originally discovers the curse ("The Inheritance"), while in others (e. g. [...] "Tales of the Undead", [...] "A Cup of Time", [...] "Vanity's Mirror", [...] "Read my Lips", [...] "The Mephisto Ring", [...] "The Prisoner") another person has learned of the object's power and obtained it before the object is recovered. Since the cursed antiques are completely indestructible, they must be locked away in a vault beneath [...] "Curious Goods" [...] (the rechristened antique store) that is designed to magically render the objects inert. A manifest, written by Lewis, holds the records of all the cursed objects sold by him.
