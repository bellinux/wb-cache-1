25|$|To {{meteorite}} researchers, {{the term}} presolar grains has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> presolar grains found in meteorites, which consist overwhelmingly of stardust. Many {{other types of}} cosmic dust have not been detected in meteorites. Presolar stardust grains comprise only about 0.1 {{percent of the total}} mass of particulate matter found in meteorites.

Their isotopic differences from the encasing meteorite require that they predate the Solar System. The crystallinity of those clusters ranges from micrometer-sized silicon carbide crystals (up to 1013 atoms), down to that of nanometer-sized diamond (about 1000 atoms), and unlayered graphene crystals of fewer than 100 atoms. The refractory grains achieved their mineral structures by condensing thermally within the slowly cooling expanding gases of supernovae and of red giant stars.|$|E

Since the 1970s, self-help books, psychology, and some modern expressions of Christianity have viewed this disparity in terms of grace being an innate quality within all people who must be inspired or strong enough to find it: something to achieve. In contrast to Newton's vision of wretchedness as his willful sin and distance from God, wretchedness has instead <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> an obstacle of physical, social, or spiritual nature to overcome {{in order to achieve}} a state of grace, happiness, or contentment. Since its immense popularity and iconic nature, [...] "grace" [...] and the meaning behind the words of [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] have become as individual as the singer or listener. Bruce Hindmarsh suggests that the secular popularity of [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] is due to the absence of any mention of God in the lyrics until the fourth verse (by Excell's version, the fourth verse begins [...] "When we've been there ten thousand years"), and that the song represents the ability of humanity to transform itself instead of a transformation taking place at the hands of God.
