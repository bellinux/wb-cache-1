5|$|It was {{announced}} that TecToy has developed a new Genesis console that not only looks almost {{identical to the original}} model of the Sega Genesis known as the Genesis III, but also has a traditional cartridge slot and SD <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> which will be released in June 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Octopus card uses {{encryption}} for all airborne {{communication and}} performs mutual authentication between {{the card and}} reader based on the ISO 9798-2 three-pass mutual authentication protocol. In other words, data communications are only established when the card and reader have mutually authenticated based on a shared secret access key. This means that {{the security of the}} Octopus card system would be jeopardized should the access key be exposed. A stolen Octopus <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> could be used with stolen Octopus software, for example, to add value (up to HK$1,000) to any Octopus card without authorization. Nevertheless, as of 2003, the Octopus card and system have never been successfully hacked.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} release of Mockingjay, many bookstores held midnight release parties. The {{official}} event in New York City was attended by Collins, and included many activities such as a tarot <b>card</b> <b>reader,</b> a magician, jugglers and face-painters. Prizes such as signed copies of Catching Fire and Hunger Games-themed cups were raffled. Once Collins arrived, she read {{the first chapter of}} the novel, explaining that she would read with an accent since Katniss, the narrator, is from Appalachia. By midnight, copies were being sold with a signature stamp since Collins had a hand injury and was unable to sign.|$|E

5|$|Making or {{recording}} a payment using the card for public transport or purchases at Octopus-enabled retailers {{can be done}} by holding the card against or waving it over an Octopus <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> from up to a few centimetres away. The reader will acknowledge payment by emitting a beep, and displaying the amount deducted and the remaining balance of the card. Standard transaction time for readers used for public transport is 0.3 seconds, while that of readers used for retailers is 1 second. When using the MTR system, the entry point of commuters is noted when a passenger enters, and the appropriate amount based on distance traveled will be deducted when the users validate their cards again at the exit point.|$|E
5|$|Octopus <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> {{includes}} a fail-safe that prevents reader from initiating transaction {{when more than}} one card is being detected at the same time. On 11 February 2009, Sing Tao Daily reported that the fail-safe has been abused for fare evasion through the railway station turnstile. A large amount of dishonest passengers at Sheung Shui Station and Lo Wu Station were stacking up 4 or more cards before breaking through the turnstile, pretending their cards have been touched with the reader correctly but triggering the fail-safe deliberately to avoid card value deduction. Because of this, if they get caught by the station staff, they can make an excuse of a hardware malfunction and offer the Octopus card with an unsuccessful transaction.|$|E
5|$|Prosecuting {{attorney}} Ed Danvers (Željko Ivanek) tells Howard (Melissa Leo) {{that if she}} cannot {{find more}} evidence against Ralph Fenwick (Michael Sheldon), who is a suspect in a brutal murder, Danvers will have to plead to manslaughter. The next day, Howard tells her partner Felton (Daniel Baldwin) she was visited by the ghost of Fenwick's murder victim and told where the murder weapon was, but Howard cannot find it. Felton does not believe her, and Howard grows angry when he tells Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) about the ghost experience. The next day, however, Howard and Felton arrest Fenwick after finding the murder weapon based on advice Felton got from a tarot <b>card</b> <b>reader.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{proprietary}} {{nature of}} the complete SD specification affects embedded systems, laptop computers, and some desktop computers; many desktop computers do not have card slots, instead using USB-based <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> if necessary. These <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> present a standard USB mass storage interface to memory cards, thus separating the operating system from {{the details of the}} underlying SD interface. However, embedded systems (such as portable music players) usually gain direct access to SD cards and thus need complete programming information. Desktop <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> are themselves embedded systems; their manufacturers have usually paid the SDA for complete access to the SD specifications. Many notebook computers now include SD <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> not based on USB; device drivers for these essentially gain direct access to the SD card, as do embedded systems.|$|R

5|$|The first {{changes to}} the {{gameplay}} of the Monopoly game itself occurred {{with the publication of}} both the Monopoly Here & Now Electronic Banking Edition by Hasbro UK and Monopoly: The Mega Edition by Winning Moves Games in 2006. The Electronic Banking Edition uses VISA-branded debit cards and a debit <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> for monetary transactions, instead of paper bills. This edition is available in the UK, Germany, France, Australia and Ireland. A version was released in the U.S. in 2007, albeit without the co-branding by Visa. An electronic counter had been featured in the Stock Exchange editions released in Europe in the early 2000s (decade), and is also a feature of the Monopoly City board game released in 2009.|$|E
5|$|A detective named Havez (Dwight McFee) {{takes over}} as Bruckman's guard when Mulder and Scully {{are called to}} {{investigate}} yet another new murder victim: the tarot <b>card</b> <b>reader.</b> As they leave they bump into a bellhop who is delivering food to Bruckman's room. The bellhop is actually the killer, and when he enters the room (while Havez is in the washroom), he is delighted to discover that Bruckman has been brought right to where he works. As {{he is about to}} kill Bruckman, Havez re-enters and the killer attacks and kills him instead. Meanwhile, Scully finds the same silk fiber at the new crime scene, and realizing that the bellhop had it on his tray, deduces that he is the murderer. They rush back to the hotel. Mulder chases the killer to the basement kitchen and the scene plays out as described in Bruckman's earlier premonition, but when the killer attacks Mulder, Scully arrives {{in the nick of time}} and shoots him—what Bruckman had seen was the dying killer's last thoughts, not Mulder's death.|$|E

Additional credit may {{be purchased}} via cash or NETS at any General Ticketing Machine (GTM), Add Value Machine, TransitLink Ticket Office, Passenger Service Centre, AXS Station, DBS/POSB/OCBC/UOB Automatic Teller Machines, online via a <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> purchased separately, or selected merchants. Additional credit of a predetermined value may also be automatically credited into the card when the card value runs low via an automatic recharge service provided by Interbank GIRO or credit card. An Adult Monthly Travel Card for unlimited travel on MRT, LRT and buses may also be purchased and is non-transferable.|$|E
25|$|Flash memory cards, e.g., Secure Digital cards, are {{available}} in various formats and capacities, and are used by many consumer devices. However, while virtually all PCs have USB ports, allowing the use of USB flash drives, memory <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> are not commonly supplied as standard equipment (particularly with desktop computers). Although inexpensive <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> {{are available}} that read many common formats, this results in two pieces of portable equipment (<b>card</b> plus <b>reader)</b> rather than one.|$|R

Hurley arrives home, telling his mother his intent to go to Australia to end the bad luck curse he believes was bestowed upon him after he won the lottery. She tries to disprove the curse by revealing his father has returned to them after seventeen years. Suspecting his father of only wanting the lottery money, Hurley reacts angrily. David brings his son to a tarot <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> (Suzanne Krull), who tells Hurley she can 'remove' the curse before admitting that David paid her to say this. Hurley vows to give the money away, and begins packing for Australia. David acknowledges he just returned for the money, but approves of Hurley's decision and promises he will be waiting for him when Hurley gets back.|$|E
5|$|Other {{than the}} Octopus card itself, {{operator}} Octopus Cards Limited also sells watches and mobile phone covers that function as anonymous Octopus cards. The types of watches available include wrist watches, pocket watches, and watch key chains. The mobile phone covers were {{specifically designed for}} Nokia models 3310 and 3330, and iPhone 4 and 4S. As with the card itself, these products are used by waving them over a <b>card</b> <b>reader.</b> They may be reloaded with money value {{the same way as}} the card itself, including automatic reloading via the Automatic Add Value Service, with the exception that they cannot be reloaded at Add Value Machines due to their shapes. An Octopus watch or mobile phone cover may be stored with a maximum of HK$1,000, but do not have any initial stored value at the time of its purchase. It may have a maximum negative value of HK$35 as with an Octopus card. These products are not refundable for their costs, but the remaining value stored on them may be refunded if they are damaged, with the damaged product itself also returned to the customer.|$|E
25|$|Smart cards, often colloquially {{referred}} to as “chip cards” were {{designed to provide a}} more secure financial transaction than a traditional credit card. They contain simple embedded integrated circuits designed to performed cryptographic functions. They connect directly to a <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> which provides the power necessary to perform an encrypted financial transaction. Many side-channel attacks {{have been shown to be}} effective against smart cards because they obtain their power supply and clock directly from the <b>card</b> <b>reader.</b> By tampering with a <b>card</b> <b>reader,</b> it is simple to collect traces and perform side-channel attacks. Other works, however, have also shown that smart cards are vulnerable to electromagnetic attacks as well.|$|E

25|$|A {{more complex}} {{arrangement}} exists at Wimbledon station; tram passengers starting their journey there must pass through ticket gates {{in order to}} reach the tram platform, and therefore need to touch their Oyster card to open the barriers. They must then touch their Oyster card once again on the <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> on the Tramlink platform to confirm their journey as a tram passenger. Tram passengers arriving in Wimbledon must not touch out on the <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> on the Tramlink platform, but must touch-out to exit via the station gates. If the card is touched on the platform, the touch-out at the gate would be seen as a touch-in and cause the maximum fare to be charged to the card.|$|E

50|$|CTA's Automated Fare Collection (AFC) {{system was}} {{installed}} in 1997 by Cubic Transportation Systems, Inc., the largest provider of AFC systems in the USA. The AFC system replaced the CTA’s tokens with magnetic-stripe stored-value cards printed on plastic or paper based on Cubic's earlier MetroCard implementation in New York City. All fare collection and payment equipment {{was designed to be}} retrofitted at a later date with smart <b>card</b> <b>readers,</b> a technology that was on the horizon. A small pilot program (“Chicago Gold”) for reduced-fare disabled riders in 1999 led to a contract with Cubic to install smart <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> universally in 2000. In August 2000, a more extensive “Chicago Card” pilot program distributed stored-value smart cards to volunteer participants. The pilot program was expanded system-wide in November 2002. The Chicago Card Plus debuted in January 2004. “Go Lane” <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> were installed in the buses, starting in 2005, allowing Chicago Card users to bypass the line of passengers using the farebox; however, only one payment could be accepted at a time, eliminating this possible efficiency. The Go Lane <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> were removed starting in May 2010 and Chicago <b>Card</b> <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> were moved back to the main fare box.|$|R
