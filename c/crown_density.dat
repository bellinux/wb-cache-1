It was shown that tree <b>crown</b> <b>density</b> did not significantly influence the abundance of litter macrofauna and the abundance of litter invertebrates. The Shannon and Pielou diversity indexes have a tendency to raise the gradient of tree <b>crown</b> <b>density</b> (from 50 % to 90 – 100 %). The relative abundance of saprophages and zoophages reached its minimum (median was 18 % and 3 %, respectively) in forest sites with sparse crown cover, and, at the level of tendency, was higher in dense forests with a closed crown (median was 40 % and 18 %, respectively). The relative abundance of polyphages, on the contrary, was lower in these conditions (82 % in sparse and 27 % in closed crown cover). The number of species in each trophic group did not significantly change in relation to tree <b>crown</b> <b>density.</b> At sites with 70 – 79 % tree <b>crown</b> <b>density</b> the size structure of the litter macrofauna was close to its optimal condition. The relative abundance of ants reached its maximum (median 73 %) in sparsely timbered sites (up to 50 % tree <b>crown</b> <b>density),</b> the relative share of Isopoda reached its maximum (median 40 %) at sites with average <b>crown</b> <b>density</b> (50 – 59 %). At densely wooded sites the taxonomic structure at the level of order and family was more or less level, without clearly dominant groups, each order and family occupying about 15 % {{of the total number of}} macrofauna. The relative abundance of the majority of orders and families did not significantly vary in response to different levels of tree <b>crown</b> <b>density.</b> The influence of herbaceous layer cover on macrofauna was in general less than that of tree <b>crown</b> <b>density.</b> The abundance of litter macrofauna in deciduous forests reached its maximum at sites with the two extreme variants of herbaceous layer cover: sparse herbaceous cover (up to 15 %) and dense herbaceous cover (over 90 %). The minimal abundance of litter macrofauna was observed at sites with average herbaceous layer density (45 – 59 %). The number of species and the Shannon and Pielou diversity indexes did not vary significantly in relation to changes in herbaceous layer density in deciduous forests of the steppe zone of Ukraine. The number of phtyophage species was higher at sites with average values for herbaceous layer density, while the number of saprophage, zoophage and polyphage species did not significantly change. The dominance structure of litter macrofauna was maximally transformed at sites with the extreme variants of herbaceous layer cover: sparse herbaceous cover (up to 15 %) and dense herbaceous cover (over 90 %).

40|$|The {{transparency}} of trees {{is the most}} important indicator for a forest health assessment. This paper presents an efficient method for calculating the crown transparency coefficient from tree binary images. This coefficient is based on the automated quantification of the deep indentation, macro-hole and micro-hole densities. Circular structuring elements are introduced, among other things, to automatically find the significant biological size. The symmetric tree convex hull and the tree smoothed contour are defined to delineate the reference areas necessary to evaluate the above-mentioned densities. Statistical thresholds are proposed to eliminate human operator subjectivity, especially in the automated identification of anatomical elements such as soft and deep crown-indentations or macro and micro crown-holes. A point-wise transparency map is produced to better appreciate the origin of the visible skylight areas in the crown. The <b>crown</b> micro-hole <b>density</b> is calculated from the 0. 1 -to- 0. 5 transparency points, the <b>crown</b> macro-hole <b>density</b> from the 0. 5 -to- 1 transparency points.

40|$|The {{relationships}} between the spectral properties of Arizona soils and rangelands and their characteristics were studied. The per cent reflectance of soils was determined using a multispectral hand-held radiometer, and the spectral response of Arizona rangeland sites was measured by scanners aboard an orbiting satellite. These spectral properties were related, by means of stepwise multiple regressions, to various soil and site characteristics. This research is presented in three chapters. The first chapter describes the {{relationships between}} soil properties and their spectral reflectance as determined in a laboratory environment. The second chapter attempts to correlate spectral properties of soils measured with a radiometer and that measured by scanners aboard an orbiting satellite for a small area near Winkelman, Arizona. The third chapter describes the {{relationships between the}} properties of 243 rangeland sites in central and southeastern Arizona and Landsat spectral data values. Determinations of Munsell soil colors and the radiometrically measured reflectance of 163 soils {{led to the development of}} charts for converting Munsell color to reflectance. Little difference was found between Munsell color measured in the sun and that measured indoors, and on the average, soil scientists were in agreement 80 per cent of the time. Munsell value, organic carbon, carbonates, and Munsell chroma explained 80 per cent of the variability within the reflectance measurements of these soils. The spectral response of the less than 2 mm soil fraction collected from rangeland surfaces was significantly different from the spectral response of coarser fragments collected from the same surface. In the Winkelman area the radiometrically measured reflectance of the less than 2 mm fraction alone accounted for 46 per cent of the variability and the reflectance of the 13 to 76 mm fraction accounted for 17 per cent of the variability within the satellite measured response. This area had a low vegetative cover and soil-geologic features, particularly soil color, correlated best with the Landsat digital data. Seventy-six per cent of the satellite data were explained by the interaction of the per cent coarse fragments times its reflectance, the average slope of the sites and the per cent soil less than 2 mm fraction times its reflectance. The relationship between the properties of 110 rangeland sites in central Arizona and the sum of the four Landsat spectral bands was determined. The sum of brush and forest <b>crown</b> <b>densities,</b> elevation, soil color,Geology of the site, and the per cent of surface covered with cobbles explained 82 per cent of this variation. An evaluation of field measurements only to explain the variability among mapping units showed the sum of brush and forest <b>crown</b> <b>densities,</b> elevation, clay content, and fragments greater than 2 mm explained 67 per cent of this variation. When satellite data were added to the field measurement site characteristics, the ratio of satellite scanner bands 4 + 5 to 6 + 7 becomes the most significant factor in explaining the variation among mapping unit symbols and a greater per cent of the variability could be explained. A similar study conducted on 133 sites in southeastern Arizona gave different results as only 41 per cent of the variability could be explained. It was shown that for central and southern Arizona rangelands, it is possible to define specific relationships between site characteristics and satellite measured spectral response. Less than ten site characteristics and their interactions explain considerable portions of the variability between mapping units for a given survey.

However, fuelbreak prescriptions typically involve the elimination of all snags in order to prevent falling hazards to firefighters. As well, it might behoove managers to think about mechanical fuels treatments that reduce fuel particle size (e.g. through chipping) or fuel bed depth (e.g. through crushing or compaction) rather than physically removing fuels.

40|$|Vegetation {{structure}} in water-limited systems is {{to a large}} degree controlled by ecohydrological processes, including mean annual precipitation (MAP) modulated by the characteristics of precipitation and geomorphology that collectively determine how rainfall is distributed vertically into soils or horizontally in the landscape. We anticipate that woody canopy cover, <b>crown</b> <b>density,</b> crown size, and the level of spatial aggregation among woody plants in the landscape will vary across environmental gradients. A high level of woody plant aggregation is most distinct in periodic vegetation patterns (PVPs), which emerge as a result of ecohydrological processes such as runoff generation and increased infiltration close to plants. Similar, albeit weaker, forces may influence the spatial distribution of woody plants elsewhere in savannas. Exploring these trends can extend our knowledge of how semi-arid vegetation structure is constrained by rainfall regime, soil type, topography, and disturbance processes such as fire. Using high-spatial-resolution imagery, a flexible classification framework, and a crown delineation method, we extracted woody vegetation properties from 876  sites spread over African savannas. At each site, we estimated woody cover, mean crown size, <b>crown</b> <b>density,</b> and the degree of aggregation among woody plants. This enabled us to elucidate the effects of rainfall regimes (MAP and seasonality), soil texture, slope, and fire frequency on woody vegetation properties. We found that previously documented increases in woody cover with rainfall is more consistently a result of increasing crown size than increasing density of woody plants.

This species is economically the most important forest tree in southern Brazil and estimation of its reserves {{and the rate of}} exploitation are important. Two forest areas were selected for detailed studies. For one area (Quedas do Iguacu) Landsat data in both computer compatible tape (CCT) and transparency format was used. No aerial photographs were available but an existing forest map was used as ground truth. For the second area (Mangueirinha) Landsat CCTs and aerial photographs were available. From the latter a forest cover type map was produced and used as ground truth. Additionally some field checking was undertaken. For the Quedas do Iguacu area visual qualitative temporal analyses were carried out on the products generated from transparencies of six different Landsat scenes. On these Parana Pine stands could be recognized in the MSS bands 6 and 7 and in colour composites generated from the MSS bands 4, 5 and 7. For a selected subarea a supervised computer classification using CCT data was tested success-fully for mapping both mature Parana Pine stands and reforestation areas. A supervised classification using transparencies of MSS bands 5 and 7 that were scanned and digitized by microdensitometer successfully mapped Parana Pine stands but failed to discriminate reforestation areas.

A series of outdoor experiments were carried out in order to study the effect of the <b>crown</b> <b>density,</b> including 3 simulated crown densities and 2 real tests. In the experiments, the collected Pinus Sylvestris needles in the Da Hinggan Mountains of China are used. The dynamic variations of the weights of the needles are captured in 0. 5 h or 1 h interval, and the dry weights of them are measured after 24 h kiln dry.

40|$|The {{response}} of N-fertilisation, irrigation, acid irrigation, and liming on concentrations of elements in needles, fluxes of elements in litter, volume increment, and <b>crown</b> <b>density</b> {{on a full}} stocked, healthy, and vigorously growing mature spruce stand was investigated. The plots of the Höglwald site in Southern Bavaria exhibited a high volume increment with regularly more than 20 m 3 ha 1 per year, despite the high age of the stand (77 years {{at the beginning of}} the experiment in 1984). Neither a distinct growth reduction of the stand due to acid irrigation, or N oversaturation, nor an enhancement of growth due to N-fertilisation, irrigation, or liming of the stand could be detected. For the years 1984 and 1985 a marked decrease in <b>crown</b> <b>density</b> was detected for all plots. This was followed by a stagnation for 2 years. Afterwards the <b>crown</b> <b>density</b> improved until the end of the investigation for all plots. Neither acid irrigation, nor liming altered the amount of litter fall. Ca fluxes in litter, and concentrations in needles were enhanced on most of the limed plots five to six years after liming. Acid irrigation reduced Ca content in litter, but other elements were not or only slightly influenced. The nutritional status of all plots as shown by the concentrations of elements in needles indicates that for most of the years a sufficient to high supply of N, P, Ca, and Mg for all investigated plots, whereas K concentration in needles exhibited wide year to year variations. Most of the elemental concentrations in needles and fluxes in litter were not influenced by any of the treatments. Also, N-fertilisation did not enhance the N concentrations in needles significantly. # 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Pruning {{density is}} the {{relative}} number of trees pruned; pruning severity {{is the amount}} of live <b>crown</b> removed. Pruning <b>density</b> and severity experiments were installed in two coastal western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla [Raf. ] Sarg.) plantations, 12 and 13 years old, on Vancouver Island. The pruning density experiment indicated that a single 3 -m pruning lift significantly reduced 4 -year average diameter by 1. 3 cm and height by 0. 5 m, regardless of whether all or half the trees were pruned on a plot.

40|$|Mohammed Jasim Al-Juboori Department of Oral Surgery, MAHSA University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Abstract: The {{displacement}} of a dental implant into the maxillary sinus {{may lead to}} implant failure due to exposure of the apical third or {{the tip of the}} implant beyond the bone, resulting in soft tissue growth. This case report discusses dental implant placement in the upper first molar area with maxillary sinus involvement of approximately 2 mm. A new technique for progressive implant loading was used, involving immediately loaded implants with maxillary sinus perforation and low primary stability. Follow-up was performed with resonance frequency analysis and compared with an implant placed adjacent in the upper second premolar area using a conventional delayed loading protocol. Implants with maxillary sinus involvement showed increasing stability during the healing period. We found that progressive implant loading may be a safe technique for the placement of immediately loaded implants with maxillary sinus involvement.

40|$|To {{address the}} problem of crown fire hazard urban intermix problem in the Ponderosa pine forests around Spokane, WA., using field data we linked three mod-els, CROWNS 2, NEXUS, and FVS/SVS/SUPPOSE. By {{manipulating}} these models, we were able to obtain indications of expected outcomes given certain levels of risk. CROWNS 2 and NEXUS were used to deter-mine <b>crown</b> bulk <b>density</b> and expected fire behavior, FVS/SVS/SUPPOSE was used to obtain effective life of treatment and visual outputs. With the goal of elimi-nating crown fire hazard, four different thinning and pruning regimes were then modeled, giving expected current stand fire behavior, current treated stand fire behavior, and future expected stand fire behavior. The models were useful in illustrating risks, hazards and the potential outcomes of different treatments. To become more widely used, the models will have to be combined with appropriate algorithms and standard-ized inventory data. Both accuracy and assumptions of models must be verified...|$|R
