40|$|Design of Experiments (DoE) were {{developed}} and performed {{in an effort}} to discover and resolve the causes of three different manufacturing issues; large panel voids after Hot Air Solder Leveling (HASL), <b>cable</b> <b>hole</b> locations out of tolerance after lamination and delamination/solder wicking around flat flex cable circuit lands after HASL. Results from a first DoE indicated large panel voids could be eliminated by removing the pre-HASL cleaning. It also revealed eliminating the pre-HASL bake would not be detrimental when using a hard press pad lamination stackup. A second DoE indicated a reduction in hard press pad stackup lamination pressure reduced panel stretch in the y axis approximately 70 %. A third DoE illustrated increasing the pre-HASL bake temperature could reduce delamination/solder wicking when using a soft press pad lamination stackup...|$|E

40|$|Shielding a {{sensitive}} device against DC or AC stray magnetic fields {{can be realized}} very efficiently with high-Tc superconductors. A simple magnetic shield can be obtained with a tube enclosing the device, which is protected against external fields until the magnetic flux diffuses either across the tube wall or through the end openings. A better shielding vessel is obtained by using superconducting end caps. In the simplest design, the end caps, consisting of superconducting disks placed at the extremities of the tube, are making a 90 degree angle with the tube wall. Because of demagnetization effects, this arrangement results in a 'weak spot' for the penetrating magnetic flux. In this work, we investigate numerically different shapes for the end caps {{so as to avoid}} sharp angles and obtain a smoother magnetic flux penetration. The external magnetic induction is applied parallel to the shield axis. The magnetic flux distribution and the shielding currents are calculated with a finite element approach. The shielded volume is defined as the region where the local magnetic flux density is attenuated below a given fraction of the external field. It is studied {{as a function of the}} shape of the cap, its superconducting properties, the aspect ratio of the assembly, and the presence of a <b>cabling</b> <b>hole.</b> Curved and elongated caps, which could in principle be obtained by melt cast processing or different coating techniques, are shown to substantially increase the shielded volume...|$|R

50|$|During the {{earthquake}} of 11 March 2011, the Tokai power plant suffered external power-loss, just {{like what happened}} in Fukushima. Thanks to extra voluntary measures taken by Japan Atomic Power, the reactors could still be safely cooled, and an additional major accident was prevented. In 2002, an evaluation technology adopted by the Japan Society of Civil Engineers had determined that {{the site of the}} plant could experience tsunami waves as high as 4.86 metres. The government of Ibaraki prefecture published their own calculations in October 2007, where they estimated that such waves could be as high as 6 to 7 metres. Japan Atomic Power changed its wave level assumption to 5.7 meters. Reconstruction works to raise the height of the 4.9-metre protection around the plant to 6.1 meters were started in July 2009, {{in order to protect the}} seawater pumps intended to cool an emergency diesel generator. Although most of the work was completed by September 2010, <b>cable</b> <b>holes</b> in the levee were still not fully covered. This work was scheduled to be completed around May 2011. When the tsunami did hit the Tokai plant in March, the waves were 5.3 to 5.4 metres in height, higher than earlier estimations but still 30 to 40 centimetres lower than the most recent estimation. The Tokai plant suffered a loss of external power-supply just like the Fukushima plant. The levee was overrun in Tokai, as with Fukushima, but only one of three seawater pumps failed, and the reactors could be kept stable and safe in cold shutdown with the emergency diesel generator cooled by the two remaining seawater pumps.|$|R
50|$|A vented gauge {{pressure}} transmitter for example allows the outside air {{pressure to be}} exposed to the negative side of the pressure sensing diaphragm, via a vented <b>cable</b> or a <b>hole</b> {{on the side of the}} device, so that it always measures the pressure referred to ambient barometric pressure. Thus a vented gauge reference pressure sensor should always read zero pressure when the process pressure connection is held open to the air.|$|R
50|$|Unicomp's {{product line}} {{historically}} consists mostly of IBM or Lexmark-originated designs, or slight modifications of those designs. For example, Unicomp's Classic (formerly called Customizer) 101 {{is essentially a}} renaming of IBM's 42H1292 (a later variant of IBM's Model M) keyboard, with the same non-detachable <b>cable,</b> drain <b>holes</b> in case of beverage spillage, and built on the same machines as the original. Other than the manufacturer's logo, the only changes to the Classic 101 from IBM's 42H1292 are the additional option of a black-colored case with lighter-gray keys and availability of the keyboard with a USB cable. A lighter variant of the Unicomp Classic containing thirty percent less plastic is sold under the name Ultra Classic (formerly called SpaceSaver). A variant of the Ultra Classic, still sold under its former name as the SpaceSaver M, is intended for Macintosh computers as a buckling-spring replacement for the laptop-style Apple Keyboard. Special requests are also handled, at additional cost.|$|R
40|$|The {{sensing head}} of a two-color band ratioing {{pyrometer}} of a known type using a fiber optic cable to couple radiation to dual detector photodiodes is improved to have high spatial resolution by focusing the radiation received through an objective lens (i. e., by focusing {{the image of a}} target area) onto an opaque sheet spaced in front of the input end of the fiber optic <b>cable.</b> A two-mil <b>hole</b> in that sheet then passes radiation to the input end of the cable. The detector has two channels, one for each color band, with an electronic-chopper stabilized current amplifier as the input stage followed by an electronic-chopper stabilized voltage amplifier...|$|R

Pre-stressing, <b>cables,</b> pre-cracking and <b>holes</b> can also be added to models to reflect the required attributes of structures. To aid the user in modeling, attachments such as *.dxf, *.stl, *.dgn, and *.jpeg can be easily imported. Models can also be imported from several FEM based software programs such as Abaqus, ANSYS, Etabs, Gambit, Ideas, LS-DYNA, Nastran, Patran, SAP2000, and STAAD. ELS is Building Information Modeling (BIM) compatible with a plug-in for Autodesk Revit Structure, allowing users to import previously created structural components.|$|R
50|$|The {{moving parts}} and hinges can wear out or break. The most serious common problem arose {{because of a}} design fault in the screen <b>cable</b> where tooling <b>holes</b> caused {{unnecessary}} stressing due to additional bending of the cable at this point each time the Psion Series 5 was opened or closed and eventually leading to failure of the cable, which caused a serious display malfunction {{and the appearance of}} vertical lines on the screen. The screen cable to the Psion Series 5 was more durable than the screen cable of the Psion Series 5mx. There was an after-market cable available for the 5mx which aimed to eliminate this problem (see Psionflexi in the 'External links' below).|$|R
50|$|Roller cutting: Process {{whereby the}} vacuum formed product {{is placed on}} a custom made cutter and pushed through a roller cutter machine. An {{efficient}} way of cutting vacuum formed items from the original sheet of vacuum forming material. The cutter can also cut any necessary <b>holes,</b> such as <b>cable</b> or access <b>holes,</b> at the same time. Roller cutting is suitable for fairly large items, where precision alignment is not required. As the vacuum formings and the cutter are rolled sideways through the roller cutter machine, some misalignment can occur. Roller cutting can't be used for making holes or features in the sides of vacuum formings, as the cutter tool always cuts vertically from the bottom.|$|R
40|$|AbstractHole flanges are {{important}} functional elements in many {{sheet metal parts}}. They provide stiffness, allow for positioning and fixation, they guide <b>cables</b> etc. <b>Hole</b> flanging operations in sheet metal parts are typically performed using dedicated tooling. Recent publications proved that hole flanging by incremental sheet forming (i. e. incremental hole flanging) is an interesting alternative to the traditional operations with dedicated tools. In incremental hole flanging, limit hole expansion ratios of up to 4 were observed which are {{much larger than the}} typical expansion ratios of around 2. In addition, the high flexibility of the incremental sheet forming process is maintained, i. e. flanges can be formed using a universal CNC-driven forming tool without dedicated tooling. However, deficits in terms of process time and geometric accuracy still limit the industrial application. This paper investigates the process limits of incremental hole flanging and proposes two new approaches aiming to reduce current deficits. The first one is an adaptive blank holder that acts {{in the vicinity of the}} forming tool and reduces unwanted secondary deformation that would lead to deviations from the target geometry. The second one is a new process set-up that makes it possible to perform incremental hole flanging operations at high speed. Using these approaches, the flexibility of incremental forming and its advantages regarding high formability can be exploited, while the typical disadvantages such as geometric inaccuracies and long process times can be minimized...|$|R
30|$|The {{possibility}} of having information access anytime and anywhere {{has caused a}} huge increase of the popularity of wireless networks. Requirements of users and owners have been ever-increasing. However, concerns about the potential health impact of exposure to radio frequency (RF) sources have arisen and are getting accounted for in wireless network planning. In addition to adequate coverage and reduced human exposure, the installation cost of the wireless network {{is also an important}} criterion in the planning process. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm is used to optimize indoor wireless network planning while satisfying three demands: maximum coverage, minimal full installation cost (cabling, <b>cable</b> gutters, drilling <b>holes,</b> labor, etc.), and minimal human exposure. For the first time, wireless indoor networks are being optimized based on these advanced and realistic conditions. The algorithm is investigated for three scenarios and for different configurations. The impact of different exposure requirements and cost scenarios is assessed.|$|R
50|$|After Ruth Galanter was elected, {{she stated}} {{that she was}} not happy with the {{environmental}} aspects, the costs, the historical design and the safety of the vertical wall plan, so one of her early actions was to stop the city engineers from pursuing the vertical wall plan. Galanter asked the state agency California Coastal Conservancy to review the options for a canal improvement project. The Coastal Conservancy made several plans suggestions, including one using Armorflex. Armorflex was a cement material connected by <b>cables</b> and had <b>holes</b> allowing for plant growth and a gentle slope. A test site was installed on Eastern bank of Sherman Canal near the Dell Ave. Bridge. The Armorflex test site {{turned out to be a}} failure, with the plants not growing out of the block, and it looked awful aesthetically. The majority of the neighbor who would be assessed by the new design were now opposed to the Armorflex plan, and in a poll stated that they would rather have no plan than one that included Armorflex. A poll by the City of Los Angeles found that over 79 percent of the homeowners opposed the assessment project using the Armorflex material.|$|R
40|$|Examination of {{collapsed}} pillar cases {{outside of}} the empirical limits of Salamon and Munro’s in situ database has highlighted {{the need for additional}} parameters to be considered in the design of coal pillars. These include the influence of discontinuities, surrounding strata characteristics and the effects of deterioration and time. An underground pillar monitoring exercise was successful, until the dynamic collapse failure of the pillar, which was not recorded due to the manual nature of the recording. A continuous logging system is vital for further such experiments. Increased certainty is required with respect to whether the pillar was confined by a goaf, before more definite conclusions can be made. This requires a different support strategy, such as long <b>hole</b> <b>cable</b> anchors. Joint frequency, joint condition and joint orientation have an important effect on the strength of coal pillars. A new methodology has been developed to take these effects into account. An evaluation of the field data showed that pillars without any joint structures are likely to be about 10 per cent stronger than predicted by the empirical Salamon and Munro equation. A simple and flexible technique to incorporate the effect of scaling, or time effects, into pillar design, has been produced. Pillars may be designed by specifying a probability of survival for...|$|R
40|$|The Antarctic Geological Drilling Program (ANDRILL) AND- 2 A {{drill hole}} was drilled, cored and logged in {{southern}} McMurdo Sound (SMS) {{in the western}} Ross Sea, Antarctica during the austral summer of 2007. A single near-offset, over-sea ice vertical seismic profile (VSP) was collected in the AND- 2 A drill hole {{as a part of}} the logging program. The source for VSP data collection was a Generator Injector (GI) air-gun which was suspended by a <b>cable</b> through a <b>hole</b> made in the sea ice. The reason for selecting a GI air gun was the minimization of the bubble pulse effects which are prevalent in all explosive sources placed in the water column. Both time-depth curves obtained from the measurement of the whole core velocity and the VSP P-wave are similar. This is an indication that sediments are well consolidated at shallow depths. The P-wave corridor stack, the surface seismic, and the whole core data synthetic seismic traces are in a good agreement at the SMS site. Four major seismic reflectors are present in the corridor stack and they match well with the important regionally extensive unconformities, which represent major tectonic events and change in climate. Mode converted S-waves appear to have been generated at the base of the water column. S-wave splitting analysis of the two horizontal components was used to determine the dominant fracture orientation from anisotropy. S-wave velocity is the least in a direction perpendicular to major faults in the region and the slower velocity could be caused by the fractures at depth. The interpreted subsurface fracture orientations suggest that the minimum horizontal compressive stress is approximately in the east-west direction and that the maximum horizontal stress is oriented north-south...|$|R
