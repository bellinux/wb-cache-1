Initially formed by <b>clipped</b> <b>edges</b> and greens, it was later formalized by rebuilding in stone decorated with statues based on Roman myths such as the Fountain of the Ocean sculpted by Giambologna, then transferred to another location within the same garden. The small Grotto of Madama, and the Large Grotto, were begun by Vasari and completed by Ammannati and Buontalenti between 1583 and 1593.|$|R
40|$|Provided are {{methods of}} {{manufacturing}} an electrostatically clean solar array panel and the products {{resulting from the}} practice of these methods. The preferred method uses an array of solar cells, each with a coverglass where the method includes machining apertures into a flat, electrically conductive sheet so that each aperture is aligned with and undersized with respect to its matched coverglass sheet and thereby fashion a front side shield with apertures (FSA). The undersized portion about each aperture of the bottom side of the FSA shield is bonded to the topside portions nearest the edges of each aperture's matched coverglass. <b>Edge</b> <b>clips</b> {{are attached to the}} front side aperture shield edges with the <b>edge</b> <b>clips</b> electrically and mechanically connecting the tops of the coverglasses to the solar panel substrate. The FSA shield, <b>edge</b> <b>clips</b> and substrate <b>edges</b> are bonded so as to produce a conductively grounded electrostatically clean solar array panel...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{triangle}} scan conversion algorithm that works entirely in homogeneous coordinates. By using homogeneous coordinates, the algorithm avoids costly clipping tests which make pipelining or hardware implementations of previous scan conversion algorithms difficult. The algorithm handles clipping {{by the addition}} of <b>clip</b> <b>edges,</b> without the need to actually split the clipped triangle. Furthermore, the algorithm can render true homogeneous triangles, including external triangles that should pass through infinity with two visible sections. An implementation of the algorithm on Pixel-Planes 5 runs about 33 % faster than a similar implementation of the previous algorithm.

Did you ever think that the roads are the only things that are endless; that one can walk on and on and on, and never be stopped by a gate or a wall? They are the serpent of eternity. I wonder they have never been worshipped. What are the stars beside them? They never meet one another. The roads are the only things that are infinite. They are all endless.|$|R

40|$|Context. Aliasing {{artifacts}} are {{a present}} problem {{in both the}} game industryand the movie industry. With the GCN (Graphics Core Next) architectureused on both new generation of consoles; Xbox One and Playstation 4, aunified Anti-Aliasing solution can be constructed with high performance,temporal stable edges and satisfying visual fidelity. Objective. This thesis aims to implement several prototypes which willbe utilizing GCN architecture to solve aliasing artifacts such as temporalstability. Method. By doing performance measurements, a survey and an experimenton the constructed prototypes and {{current state of the}} art solutionsthis thesis will create both a benchmark between given state of the art solutionsfor the industry {{and at the same time}} evaluate the new solutions givenin this thesis. Result. With having potential of being the fastest Anti-Aliasing solutionin the field it does not only bring high performance, but also very temporalstable edges and satisfying visual quality. Conclusion. If not used as a standalone solution, the prototype can be decoupledfrom GCN specific features and be a very suitable complement forMulti Sample Anti-Aliasing which can not handle alpha <b>clipped</b> <b>edges...</b>|$|R

40|$|Black rot {{caused by}} Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) {{is one of}} the most serious {{diseases}} of crucifers world-wide. To establish the efficient screening method for resistant cabbage to Xcc, different inoculation methods, inoculation positions, growth stages of seedlings, and incubation temperatures after inoculation were investigated with the seven cabbage cultivars showing different resistance degrees to the pathogen. Clipping with mouse-tooth forceps was better inoculation method than piercing with 18 pins or cutting with scissors to distinguish the level of resistance and susceptibility. In inoculation using mouth-tooth forceps, <b>clipping</b> the <b>edges</b> of the leaves near veins is more effective than injuring the veins of the leaves directly. In addition, the inoculated plants kept at 22 oC showed more clear resistant and susceptible responses than those kept at 26 or 30 oC. On the basis of the results, we suggest that an efficient screening method for resistance of cabbage cultivars to black rot is to <b>clip</b> the <b>edges</b> of the leaves near veins of the four-week-old seedlings with mouth-tooth forceps dipped in a suspension of Xcc at a concentration of 7 × 107 cfu/ml an...|$|R

50|$|The {{inside edge}} in the sport of cricket, {{variously}} {{also referred to as}} the French cut, the Chinese cut, or the Surrey cut, is a shot played by the batsman that touches or <b>clips</b> the <b>edge</b> of the bat pointing toward the leg side of the field. This is the side of the bat that is usually closest to the batsman's pads when the batsman assumes a conventional stance facing the bowler. Alternatively, the inside edge can refer to that particular edge of the bat itself.|$|R
5000|$|Knives made in Sheffield, England, {{were quick}} to enter the market with [...] "Bowie Knives" [...] of a {{distinctive}} pattern that most modern users identify with the true form Bowie. The Sheffield pattern blade is thinner than the Black/Musso knives, while the false edge is often longer, with a more oblique and less pronounced <b>clip</b> <b>edge.</b> [...] While the Bowie is often considered a uniquely American knife, most blades were produced in Sheffield England. [...] Sheffield Bowies were sold {{with a wide range}} of etched or stamped slogans designed to appeal to Americans: [...] "Death to Abolition", [...] "Death to Traitors", [...] "Americans Never Surrender", [...] "Alabama Hunting Knife", [...] "Arkansas Toothpick", [...] "Gold Seeker's Protection"... American victories and generals were commemorated. [...] "Bowie Knife" [...] is etched on many different designs (including folding knives) of the era. [...] The British disguised the origin of their products, operating the [...] "Washington", [...] "Philadelphia", [...] "Boston", [...] "Manhattan", [...] "America" [...] and [...] "Columbia Works" [...] in Sheffield.

50|$|The Vatti {{algorithm}} involves processing both {{subject and}} <b>clipping</b> polygon <b>edges</b> {{in an orderly}} fashion, starting with the lowermost edges and working towards the top; this is conceptually similar to the Bentley-Ottmann algorithm. This sweep line approach divides the problem space by scanlines, imaginary horizontal lines that pass through every vertex of the participating polygons. These scanlines outline scanbeams - the spaces between adjacent scanlines. These scanbeams are processed in turn, starting with the lowest scanbeam, with the algorithm adding points of intersection within these scanbeams into the solution polygons.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} case of delayed {{presentation}} of a severed acrylic single-piece intraocular lens (IOL) haptic fragment causing corneal edema after uneventful phacoemulsification surgery. Observations: An 85 -year-old male presented with inferior corneal decompensation six months after a reportedly uneventful phacoemulsification in his left eye. A distal haptic fragment of an acrylic single-piece posterior chamber intraocular lens {{was found in the}} inferior anterior chamber angle. Intraoperative examination revealed that the dislocated fragment originated from the temporal haptic, the remainder of which was adherent to the anterior surface of the capsular bag. The <b>clipped</b> <b>edge</b> of the haptic fragment showed a clean, flat surface, suggesting it was severed by a sharp object. The findings were considered consistent with cutting of the fragment during implantation presumably from improper lens loading, improper implantation technique, or defective implantation devices. Conclusions and Importance: This is the first case report of a foldable acrylic intraocular lens severed during routine uncomplicated cataract surgery that was not noted {{at the time of the}} surgery or in the immediate postoperative period. Delayed presentation of severed IOL fragments should be considered in cases of late onset corneal edema post-operatively, when other causes have been ruled out. Careful implantation technique and thorough examination of the intraocular lens after implantation to assess for lens damage intraoperatively is essential to avoid such rare complications...|$|R
40|$|An uneven {{thickness}} distribution {{can cause}} serious problems in practical applications. In this report the deformation and thickness behavior of poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film during transverse stretching in a tenter is discussed. The experiments were {{performed in a}} pilot plant with extrusion, casting, machine direction (MD) stretching, transverse direction (TD) stretching and thermosetting and winding processes. The thickness distribution of the PET film was measured after uniaxial orientation (MD stretched) and again after biaxial orientation (TD stretched in the tenter). The thickness behavior during the transverse stretching in the tenter was calculated by a finite element method (FEM), assuming a rigid-plastic or elastic-plastic constitutive law with parameters determined from the tensile stress-strain measurements. The tensile stress-strain tests were performed on MD stretched film in the transverse stretching direction. The FEM analysis was carried out using the measured initial thickness distribution of the uniaxially oriented film (MD stretched). It was estimated from this analysis that the (TD) stretching of the film in the tenter initiated near the tenter <b>clip</b> (<b>edge</b> of film), spread {{to the center of}} the film and then finally moved from the center to the edge of the film under the experimental conditions of this study. Good agreement was obtained between the experimental and predicted FEM results for the final film thickness distribution after transverse stretching...|$|R

40|$|The goal {{of color}} {{constancy}} is to measure image colors despite {{differences in the}} color of the light source. Traditionally, the computational method of obtaining this ability is by using pixel values only. Recently, methods using edges instead of pixel values have been proposed. However, different edge types exist, such as material, shadow and specular edges. Therefore, in this paper, the main goal is to analyze the influence of different edge types on the performance of edge-based color constancy. It is shown that, on generated data without color <b>clipping,</b> specular <b>edges</b> deliver near-perfect color constancy and that shadow edges are more valuable than material edges. However, with color clipping, the performance using the specular edges decreases significantly, while the performance using the material or shadow edges is less affected...|$|R
