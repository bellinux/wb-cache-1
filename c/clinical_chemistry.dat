It is used in <b>clinical</b> <b>chemistry</b> to separate proteins by charge and/or size (IEF agarose, essentially size independent) and in biochemistry and molecular biology to separate a mixed population of DNA and RNA fragments by length, to estimate the size of DNA and RNA fragments or to separate proteins by charge.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{laboratory}} sciences are {{the clinical}} diagnostic services that apply laboratory techniques to diagnosis {{and management of}} patients. In the United States, these services are supervised by a pathologist. The personnel that work in these medical laboratory departments are technically trained staff who do not hold medical degrees, but who usually hold an undergraduate medical technology degree, who actually perform the tests, assays, and procedures needed for providing the specific services. Subspecialties include transfusion medicine, cellular pathology, <b>clinical</b> <b>chemistry,</b> hematology, clinical microbiology and clinical immunology.|$|E

40|$|Background: The Total Exposure Study was a stratified, multi-center, {{cross-sectional}} study designed to estimate levels of biomarkers of tobacco-specific and non-specific exposure and of potential harm in U. S. adult current cigarette smokers (≥one manufactured cigarette per day {{over the last}} year) and tobacco product non-users (no smoking or use of any nicotine containing products over the last 5 years). The study was designed and sponsored by a tobacco company and implemented by contract research organizations in 2002 – 2003. Multiple analyses of smoking behavior, demographics, and biomarkers were performed. Study data and banked biospecimens were transferred from the sponsor to the Virginia Tobacco and Health Research Repository in 2010, and then to SRI International in 2012, for independent analysis and dissemination. Methods: We analyzed biomarker distributions overall, and by biospecimen availability, for comparison with existing studies, and to evaluate generalizability to the entire sample. We calculated genome-wide statistical power for a priori hypotheses. We performed <b>clinical</b> <b>chemistries,</b> nucleic acid extractions and genotyping, and report correlation and quality control metrics. Results: Vital signs, <b>clinical</b> <b>chemistries,</b> and laboratory measures of tobacco specific and non-specific toxicants are available from 3585 current cigarette smokers, and 1077 non-users.

25|$|Thymidine kinases {{have a key}} {{function}} in the synthesis of DNA and therefore in cell division, as {{they are part of}} the unique reaction chain to introduce thymidine into the DNA. Thymidine is present in the body fluids as a result of degradation of DNA from food and from dead cells. Thymidine kinase is required for the action of many antiviral drugs. It is used to select hybridoma cell lines in production of monoclonal antibodies. In <b>clinical</b> <b>chemistry</b> it is used as a proliferation marker in the diagnosis, control of treatment and follow-up of malignant disease, mainly of hematological malignancies.|$|E
25|$|The cyanide {{compound}} {{sodium nitroprusside}} is used mainly in <b>clinical</b> <b>chemistry</b> to measure urine ketone bodies mainly as {{a follow-up to}} diabetic patients. On occasion, it is used in emergency medical situations to produce a rapid decrease in blood pressure in humans; it is also used as a vasodilator in vascular research. The cobalt in artificial vitamin B12 contains a cyanide ligand as an artifact of the purification process; this must be removed by the body before the vitamin molecule can be activated for biochemical use. During World War I, a copper cyanide compound was briefly used by Japanese physicians {{for the treatment of}} tuberculosis and leprosy.|$|E
25|$|The 1980s saw {{several new}} {{technologies}} that promised {{to change the}} way creatinine testing was done. Enzymatic and ion-exchange methods provided better accuracy but had other drawbacks. Enzymatic methods reduced some interferences but other new ones were discovered. High-performance liquid chromatography, HPLC, was more sensitive and specific, and had become the new reference method endorsed by the American Association for <b>Clinical</b> <b>Chemistry.</b> HPLC addressed the shortcomings of Jaffe-based methods, but was labor-intensive, expensive, and therefore impractical for routine analysis of the most frequently ordered renal analyte in medical labs. Simple, easily automated and cost-effective, Jaffe-based methods have persisted into the 21st century, despite their imperfections.|$|E

25|$|Group {{practice}} {{is the most}} traditional private practice model. In this arrangement, a group of senior pathologists will control a partnership that employs junior pathologists and contracts independently with hospitals to provide diagnostic services, as well as attracting referral business from local clinicians who practice in the outpatient setting. The group often owns a laboratory for histology and ancillary testing of tissue, and may hold contracts to run hospital-owned labs. Many pathologists who practice in this setting are trained and certified in both anatomical pathology and clinical pathology, which allows them to supervise blood banks, <b>clinical</b> <b>chemistry</b> laboratories, and medical microbiology laboratories as well.|$|E
25|$|The Jaffe {{reaction}} is a colorimetric method used in <b>clinical</b> <b>chemistry</b> to determine creatinine levels {{in blood and}} urine. In 1886, Max Jaffe (1841–1911) wrote about its basic principles in the paper Über den Niederschlag, welchen Pikrinsäure in normalem Harn erzeugt und über eine neue Reaction des Kreatinins in which he described the properties of creatinine and picric acid in an alkaline solution. The color change that occurred was directly proportional to the concentration of creatinine, however {{he also noted that}} several other organic compounds induced similar reactions. In the early 20th century, Otto Folin adapted Jaffe's research into a clinical procedure. The Jaffe reaction, despite its nonspecificity for creatinine, is still widely employed as the method of choice for creatinine testing due to its speed, adaptability in automated analysis, and cost-effectiveness, and is the oldest methodology continued {{to be used in the}} medical laboratory. It is this nonspecificity that has motivated the development of new reference methods for creatinine analysis into the 21st century.|$|E

40|$|Chloropentafluorobenzene (CPFB) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a can-didate simulant for nonpersistent chemical warfare agents. Acute toxicity studies have shown that CPFB has limited adverse ef-fects on laboratory animals.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the subchronic toxicity of selected halomethanes which are drinking water contaminants.

Subchronic 14 -day gavage studies were {{performed with the}} use of doses encompassing one-tenth the LD 50 for the compounds. A 90 -day gavage study of one of the compounds, trichloromethane, was also done. Parameters observed included body and organ weights, histopathology, hematology, <b>clinical</b> <b>chemistries,</b> and hepatic microsomal enzyme activities. Toxicity to the humoral immune system was assessed by measuring the number of splenic IgM antibody-forming cells and the serum antibody level to sheep erythrocytes. Cell-mediated immunity was evaluated by measuring the delayed type hypersensitivity response and popliteal lymph node proliferation response to sheep red blood cells. The functional activity of the reticuloendothelial system, as measured by the vascular clearance rate and tissue uptake of 51 Cr sheep red blood cells was also determined. The major effects of the halomethanes were increased liver weights, elevations of SGPT and SGOT, decreased spleen weights and a {{decrease in the number of}} splenic IgM antibody-forming cells. The humoral immune system appeared to be an indicator of halomethane toxicity. There is evidence that subchronic 14 -day exposure may be of greater value than long-term studies in determining the toxicity of these compounds...|$|R
