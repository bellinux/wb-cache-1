5|$|Many of {{the free}} peasants of Anglo-Saxon society appear to have lost status and become indistinguishable from the non-free serfs. Whether this change was due entirely to the conquest is unclear, but the {{invasion}} and its after-effects probably accelerated a process already under way. The spread of towns and increase in nucleated settlements in the countryside, rather than scattered farms, was probably accelerated by {{the coming of the}} Normans to England. The lifestyle of the peasantry probably did not greatly change in the decades after 1066. Although earlier historians argued that women became less free and lost rights with the conquest, current scholarship has mostly rejected this view. Little is known about women other than those in the landholding class, so no <b>conclusions</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> drawn about peasant women's status after 1066. Noblewomen appear to have continued to influence political life mainly through their kinship relationships. Both before and after 1066 aristocratic women could own land, and some women continued {{to have the ability to}} dispose of their property as they wished.|$|E

25|$|Because the holotype is a {{hatchling}} {{of perhaps}} {{only a few}} days old, it is hard to determine the build of the adult animal but some general <b>conclusions</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> reliably made. Scipionyx was a small bipedal predator. Its horizontal rump was balanced by a long tail. The neck was relatively long and slender. The hindlimbs and especially the forelimbs were rather elongated. Dal Sasso & Maganuco considered it likely that a coat of primitive protofeathers was present, as these are also known from some direct relatives.|$|E
25|$|The {{test can}} be scored two ways. The number correct score is {{calculated}} {{based on an}} all-or-nothing approach; points are awarded if the reproduction of the design matches the original. The number error score, on the other hand, {{is calculated based on}} the number and type of errors made for each design. The major categories for these errors are omissions, distortions, perseverations, rotations, misplacements, and size errors. These scores are then be compared to several sets of normative data available in the manual, each representing different demographic characteristics, and <b>conclusions</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> drawn by the examiner. The two different methods of scoring allow for both quantitative and qualitative analysis of an individual's test.|$|E

25|$|No firm <b>conclusions</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> drawn, however, whether {{long-term}} use of quazepam {{does not produce}} tolerance as few, if any, long-term clinical trials extending beyond 4 weeks of chronic use have been conducted. Quazepam should be withdrawn gradually if used beyond 4 weeks of use to avoid {{the risk of a}} severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome developing. Very high dosage administration over prolonged periods of time, up to 52 weeks, of quazepam in animal studies provoked severe withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation, including excitability, hyperactivity, convulsions and the death of two of the monkeys due to withdrawal-related convulsions. More monkeys died however, in the diazepam-treated monkeys. In addition it has now been documented in the medical literature that one of the major metabolites of quazepam, N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam (N-desalkylflurazepam), which is long-acting and prone to accumulation, binds unselectively to benzodiazepine receptors, thus quazepam may not differ all that much pharmacologically from other benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Peter Fritsch and his coauthors {{decided to}} do a more {{comprehensive}} test for carnivory on P. minensis after they observed nematode worms on leaf surfaces. The similarity between the habitat for Philcoxia species and that of Genlisea and their similar subterranean leaves and stems spurred the team's decision to test for potential carnivory {{in the field and}} in situ. They tested for a protease enzyme {{that is one of the}} enzymes found in other carnivorous plants and is responsible for breaking down captured prey. They hypothesized that Philcoxia could be carnivorous, capturing nematodes and possibly soil microbes like Utricularia and Genlisea do. Ultimately, Fritsch's study concluded that while no protease activity was detected, this fact does not rule out the possibility that the genus may be carnivorous in some other way. They note that there are many possibilities, such as seasonal carnivory or the unusual growth form being an adaptation to the heat and sun, and more study is needed before precise <b>conclusions</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> reached.|$|E
500|$|The {{first study}} that gave {{empirical}} data about asexuals {{was published in}} 1983 by Paula Nurius, concerning the relationship between sexual orientation and mental health. 689 subjects—most of whom were students at various universities in the United States taking psychology or sociology classes—were given several surveys, including four clinical well-being scales. Results showed that asexuals {{were more likely to}} have low self-esteem and more likely to be depressed than members of other sexual orientations; 25.88% of heterosexuals, 26.54% bisexuals (called [...] "ambisexuals"), 29.88% of homosexuals, and 33.57% of asexuals were reported to have problems with self-esteem. A similar trend existed for depression. Nurius did not believe that firm <b>conclusions</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> drawn from this for a variety of reasons.|$|E

2500|$|Sheldrake debated {{biologist}} Lewis Wolpert on {{the existence}} of telepathy in 2004 at the Royal Society of Arts in London. Sheldrake marshalled evidence for telepathy while Wolpert argued that telepathy fits Irving Langmuir's definition of pathological science and that the evidence for telepathy has not been persuasive. Reporting on the event, New Scientist said [...] "it was clear the audience saw Wolpert as no more than a killjoy. (...) There are sound reasons for doubting Sheldrake's data. One is that some parapsychology experimenters have an uncanny knack of finding the effect they are looking for. There is no suggestion of fraud, but something is going on, and science demands that it must be understood before <b>conclusions</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> drawn about the results".|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} clear {{reference to}} the Avar ethnonym comes from Priscus the Rhetor (died after 472 AD). Priscus recounts that, c. 463, the Šaragurs, Onogurs and Ogurs were attacked by the Sabirs, who had been attacked by the Avars. In turn, the Avars had been driven off by people fleeing [...] "man-eating griffins" [...] coming from [...] "the ocean" [...] (Priscus Fr 40). Whilst Priscus' accounts provide some information about the ethno-political situation in the Don-Kuban-Volga region after {{the demise of the}} Huns, no unequivocal <b>conclusions</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> reached. Denis Sinor has argued that whoever the [...] "Avars" [...] referred to by Priscus were, they differed from the Avars who appear a century later, during the time of Justinian (who reigned from 527 to 565).|$|E

Meehan notes Borgonovo's {{detailed analysis of the}} IRA in Cork, and that Borgonovo disagreed profoundly with Hart's discounting the IRA's intelligence gathering capability. Borgonovo described it as [...] "irresponsible" [...] of Hart to discount IRA claims of the Dunmanway victims' guilt in the killing of suspected or known informers without offering an analysis of IRA intelligence-gathering operations. Commenting on Hart's work on the IRA in Cork, he wrote that [...] "While Dr. Hart's <b>conclusions</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> suspected, I do not believe they can be sufficiently documented." ...|$|E

2500|$|On physiology, {{the report}} finds {{that based on}} studies available, [...] "no {{definite}} <b>conclusions</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> drawn concerning the physiological activity of birds in response to force feeding" [...] because although [...] "force feeding induced hepatic steatosis in the duck or goose", [...] "hepatic steatosis in the waterfowl is a normal metabolic response" [...] {{and there was a}} low incidence of disease indicating lesions.

As an economic indicator the report states [...] "it is strongly {{in the interest of the}} farmer" [...] to avoid disease as the [...] "resulting fat liver is of no commercial value". It summarizes that [...] "some pathologists consider this level of steatosis to be pathological but others do not" [...] and recommends that research [...] "should be carried out into methods of producing fat liver which do not require the use of force feeding".|$|E
2500|$|However, Arrian {{describes}} the occasion when Alexander and Hephaestion publicly identified themselves with close friends Achilles and Patroclus. It happened {{right at the}} beginning of the campaign in Asia when Alexander led a contingent of the army to visit Troy, scene of the events in his beloved Iliad. He laid a wreath on the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion laid a wreath on the tomb of Patroclus and they ran a race, naked, to honour their dead heroes. Arrian discreetly draws no conclusions from this, but, according to Thomas R. Martin, by no means does the identification of Alexander and Hephaestion with Achilles and Patroclus equate to their being homosexuals as Homer, author of the Iliad, never suggested that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus were homosexual or that they had sexual relations. Martin further suggests this concept was theorized by unspecified [...] "later authors", who include however such eminent writers as Aeschylus and Plato that had lived before Alexander and Hephaestion's time. Thus, according to Robin Lane Fox quite different <b>conclusions</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> drawn: ...|$|E
2500|$|Depending {{on which}} {{component}} {{of sexual orientation}} is being assessed and referenced, different <b>conclusions</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> drawn about the prevalence rate of homosexuality which has real world consequences. Knowing {{how much of the}} population is made up of homosexual individuals influences how this population may be seen or treated by the public and government bodies. For example, if homosexual individuals constitute only 1% of the general population they are politically easier to ignore or than if they are known to be a constituency that surpasses most ethnic and ad minority groups. If the number is relatively minor then it is difficult to argue for community based same sex programs and services, mass media inclusion of gay role models, or Gay/Straight Alliances in schools. For this reason, in the 1970s [...] Bruce Voeller, the chair of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force perpetuated a common myth that the prevalence of homosexuality is 10% for the whole population by averaging a 13% number for men and a 7% number for women. Voeller generalized this finding and used it as part of the modern gay rights movement to convince politicians and the public that [...] "we [...] are everywhere".|$|E
