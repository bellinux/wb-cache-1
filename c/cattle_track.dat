5000|$|Curtis {{was born}} in Jackson, Michigan to Elise and George Curtis. He had three younger brothers: Harry, Malcolm (Mike) and Robert. A bone {{chilling}} fall through the ice on Vandercook Lake near Jackson during a hunting excursion when he was sixteen led to a serious illness and a year of bed rest. The after-effects of the illness were severe and painful arthritis for which Curtis sought relief throughout his life. Curtis looked on his arthritic condition philosophically, musing that the restrictions to his activities led to his contemplative life as a painter: [...] "I'm most comfortable sitting at the easel, so I credit my arthritis with making me happy with my situation." [...] He received a B.A. from Albion College where he was introduced to art through the newly formed art department {{in the person of}} the sole faculty member, Charlotte Swanson (later Cleeland). Following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, both judges, Curtis undertook the study of law at the University of Michigan beginning in the spring of 1930. He was conflicted and eventually art won out. In the fall 1932 he enrolled in Yale University's School of Fine Art. At Yale he followed a classical course of study with emphasis on painting and drawing from life with professors Francis Taylor, Eugene Savage and Lewis York. [...] He also studied mural painting, a skill that would stand him in good stead over the next decade. he painted portraits and worked on murals to support himself while he was at Yale. Although he left Yale after three years, he had been so often promoted to advanced classes that he was awarded a four-year certificate. [...] By October 1935, Curtis was living in an apartment on Orchard Street {{on the lower east side}} in New York City. He applied several times to the Works Progress Administration's Federal Arts Program. Curtis was among the applicants who did not need relief, so he was appointed as an assistant supervisor for the Manhattan mural works project. Among the artists he worked with were Stuart Davis, Arshile Gorky and Yasuo Kuniyoshi. [...] In March 1937, the WPA sent Curtis to Phoenix to start an arts center, which is today the Phoenix Art Museum. Following his success in Phoenix, the WPA sent Curtis to Iowa to start the Des Moines Art Center. The WPA came to an end in 1941 and Curtis enrolled in a museum administration program at the Fogg Museum at Harvard University. His studies were interrupted by the Second World War, and Curtis served his country as a member of the Office of Strategic Services in Washington, D.C. At the end of the war, Curtis returned to Phoenix and in 1948 met George Ellis, a civil engineer and contractor, and his wife Racheal Murdock Ellis, an elementary school teacher and costumer. The Ellises moved a converted barn from a nearby ranch onto their property (now called <b>Cattle</b> <b>Track)</b> in Scottsdale, Arizona as a house and studio for Phil and Marge. (Marjorie Yaeger 1917-2000, they met and married in Phoenix in 1937). For the rest of his life, Curtis lived in the little house next door to the Ellis family, which eventually grew to include their three children, David, Janie and Michael.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a period}} {{characterized}} by rainstorms, landslides and famine occurred the Miracle of the Wheat. 1753 {{was a year}} really fatal: 368 people died; well among them were 12 Priests, Sisters and Brothers of the Convent. Legend has it that ... swarms of locusts destroyed any agricultural product, the wells were practically dried up. Even fertile areas of Pomarico as Trincinaro, St. James and St. Lawrence for several years did not give {{the result of the}} hard work of the men. It was since 1680 that the country was suffering. There was a terrible famine to the wheat crop. In May of 1753 it is said that an Apulian trader had come to the Colle Sisto. Not knowing the country, he went to Pomarico going down a <b>cattle</b> <b>track</b> with fruit trees and oaks on either side. H was well vested, respectful and good-hearted. During his trip he awoke the curiosity of the Pomaricans he met on the street. He stopped by the local monastery to rest.Then he went into the Piazza Nuova (now Piazza V. Veneto) and it was there that he announced to the community he had come to town to deliver grain. The news went around the neighborhoods and districts, and all rushed there by any means available. The Pomaricans who arrived at Colle Sisto were astonished to see such an amount of wheat. There were at least 8 horse-drawn wagons filled with sacks of grain. People were hungry and {{there was no time to}} organize for the grain distribution so everyone tried to take what they could through shoving. In the general crush the people were fighting for a handful of grain. From that moment, in that humanly understandable act, was given the name [...] "The Fight" [...] so that the faithful, when they meet for the procession this year on 8 May evening (which that year became the feast day of the Patron Saint [...] ) go to honor one of the most important miracles of San Michele Arcangelo in Pomarico.After the FIGHT, subsided in part by gendarmes and the monks, there remained one towering load of grain which, together with the priests and the people, was escorted to the Mother Church in the churchyard where the bags were arranged in heaps and distributed to poor people who were not able to go or had not arrived in time. The Pomaricano after the fight and successful distribution of the remaining grain which happened in the churchyard of the Old Church met in the evening with the merchant. He told them that a few days before a good-looking gentleman was presented to him under the name of [...] "Michael Pomarico" [...] and he ordered the wheat be taken to a country town that was on a hill called Pomarico. Michele pledged his ring set with a diamond stone.The dealer, together with the authorities, went in Piazza V. Veneto, the new square of Pomarico, with its shops and its wineries, looking for some Michael who fit the description. When no-one did, at the suggestion of a villager, he decided to go to the mother church.The seller, looking at the statue of the Archangel Michael donated to the people of Pomarico by Francesco del Balzo, (now housed in the glass case at the entrance of the Mother Church) he recognized the face of the ring owner.Then everyone realized that the Holy finger was missing the ring with the diamond in it, donated by the magnificent Porfida Giannulli on May 3, 1713, which the statue of the saint is still wearing in the morning procession of 8 May.The merchant and the population suddenly realized and shouted to the miracle. The seller, then, excited and stunned put the ring on the Saints finger waiving fees agreed with St. Michael the Archangel. There was general commotion culminating in joyful applause. The small town, where life flowed calm and sleepy, was reanimated. For a week the streets and the alleys were crossed by people coming and going, their faces showing the signs of a joy never experienced before. All spoke of the miracle and felt proud to witness an extraordinary event. Since that year, the Patron Saint became more and more honored.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} field {{rainfall}} simulations {{were carried out}} to study the impact of different land-use and management techniques on sediment and nutrient movement in the southern Atherton Tableland. Both farm management techniques and landscape factors appear to influence sediment and nutrient loss in runoff. The highest sediment concentration was produced on a <b>cattle</b> <b>track</b> and was substantially higher than sediment concentrations produced at all other experimental plots. In general higher sediment concentrations were associated with beef farms where the soil was most heavily impacted by cattle trampling. Loss of dissolved nitrate was at its highest on dairy sites which had greater nutrient inputs through fertilisation and nitrogen fixation by leguminous plants than either beef or rainforest sites. Nitrate concentration in runoff on the organic dairy farm {{was similar to the}} concentration at the dairy farm where mineral fertiliser was used. The position in the landscape was found to influence nitrate concentration, with the highest concentrations being measured in the lower toeslopes. Results indicate that farms should be managed and designed according to landscape features. They also demonstrate the importance of undertaking landscape scale rather than point scale studies.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate the associations among direct and indirect indicators of land use by cattle and to understand the role of some environmental factors on the definition of these indicators. The study was carried out in two areas, Nature Reserve (63. 6 ha) and Private Area (30. 4 ha), with 53 Hereford animals in each area. Daytime observations of animals’ location were used as direct indicator of land use; while <b>cattle</b> <b>track</b> and dung pat distributions throughout the areas were used as indirect indicators. Environmental characteristics recorded were: terrain slope, prevalence of woody vegetation cover (forests, isolated tress and open grasslands), as well as the position of fences, water sources and salt blocks. Spatial correlations among the three indicators of land use were low (r < 0. 30). The environmental factors had lower predictive power of animals’ sightings distribution, followed by cattle tracks, and the highest predictive power occurred for dung pat distribution. We concluded that each one of the methods evaluated in this study addresses a different aspect of land use by cattle. The environmental factors assessed were useful to predict the dung pat distribution, but less valuable to predict the cattle tracks and animals’ sightings distributions...|$|E
60|$|A knotty {{point for}} Venters {{was the fact}} that the <b>cattle</b> <b>tracks</b> all pointed west.

For many years Oldring's mysterious entrance and exit to Deception Pass had been all-absorbing topics to sage-riders.|$|R
30|$|The {{conflicts}} the Fulani {{were seeking}} to avoid were of two types {{as reflected in}} the nature of the immigration. The first is a steady slow trickle of newcomers, gradually rising over the years. These are Fulani who are avoiding, mostly, non-violent natural resource conflicts and tensions arising from population increase and land pressure as well as antagonistic practices like the denial of herder access to land and water and the closure of <b>cattle</b> <b>tracks</b> and pastures by farmers. These restrictions convey the impression to the pastoralists that they are an unwanted nuisance (Majekodunmi et al. 2013). The second is sudden and massive immigration into the KGR by internally displaced people who fled from areas of violent conflicts and insecurity, often following personal experience of violence directed at and/or perpetrated by other Fulani.|$|R
