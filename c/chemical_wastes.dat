25|$|The {{land where}} the homes were being built {{was not part}} of the {{agreement}} between the school board and Hooker; thus, none of these residents knew the canal's history. There was no monitoring or evaluating of the <b>chemical</b> <b>wastes</b> stored under the ground. Additionally, the clay cover of the canal which was supposed to be impermeable began to crack. The subsequent construction of the LaSalle Expressway restricted groundwater from flowing to the Niagara River. After the exceptionally wet winter and spring of 1962, the elevated expressway turned the breached canal into an overflowing pool. People reported having puddles of oil or colored liquid in yards or basements. There were 410 children in the school in 1978.|$|E

50|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>Waste</b> Management, Inc had {{an on-site}} well-check system {{designed}} to test for any hazardous material leakage. It had a two part system check, although the EPA at the time had raised this requirement to three checks. <b>Chemical</b> <b>Waste</b> Management was in an interim stage where it had not installed the third check yet, but had not reached the required date of installment yet.

The school board then moved the school site eighty to eighty-five feet further north. The kindergarten playground also had to be relocated because it was directly on top of a chemical dump.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Whalen, then-New York's Health Commissioner, also visited Love Canal and {{believed}} that the Canal constituted an emergency, stating: [...] "Love Canal Chemical Waste Landfill constitutes a public nuisance and an extremely serious threat and danger to the health, safety and welfare of those using it, living near it or exposed to the conditions emanating from it, consisting among other things, of <b>chemical</b> <b>wastes</b> lying exposed on the surface in numerous places pervasive, pernicious and obnoxious chemical vapors and fumes affecting both the ambient air and the homes of certain residents living near such sites." [...] Whalen also instructed people to avoid going into their basements {{as well as to}} avoid fruits and vegetables grown in their gardens. [...] People became very worried because many had consumed produce from their gardens for several years. Whalen urged that all pregnant women and {{children under the age of}} two be removed from Love Canal as soon as possible.|$|E

Two types of steel and twenty-seven species different from wood wereused. The corrosive agent, constituted of 50 g of fresh sawdust (moist) mixed to 50 ml of distilledwater, it was prepared and placed inside of the plastic box, hermetically closed, on the samples ofsteel, which were totally immersed. The box was placed in a water bath pre-heated to 75 °C, that themedium temperature of reaction is considered, that affects the sheet of the sawblade in operation. Thisgroup was operated to 80 rotations per minute (rpm). The time of reaction was of four hours. Afterthat time the corrosive agent was discarded and the samples were washed, dried and weighed. At theend, each sample was processed by a total period of forty hours. The <b>chemical</b> <b>waste</b> was evaluated by the weight difference suffered from beginning {{at the end of the}} experiment.
