50|$|In Britain, the Post Office Packet Service used small, fast, lightly armed {{ships to}} carry state papers to {{overseas}} destinations {{on a regular}} schedule. This service operated from Tudor times until 1823, when the Admiralty assumed the responsibility for running the service. During the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars the packet ships were targets for privateers and warships seeking prize money. Although some were captured, others managed to fight back. In the 1850s the Post Office moved to using <b>contract</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The airline {{began as}} Boston-Maine Airways, founded as a Pan Am <b>contract</b> <b>carrier</b> on July 20, 1931, by the Boston and Maine Railroad and Maine Central Railroad, flying from Boston to Bangor via Portland. It flew only {{sporadically}} until August 11, 1933, {{when it began}} contract service for National Airways, an agreement which lasted four years. The name Northeast Airlines was adopted on November 19, 1940.|$|E
50|$|The term {{common carrier}} {{is a common}} law term, seldom used in {{continental}} Europe because it has no exact equivalent in civil-law systems. In continental Europe, the functional equivalent of a common carrier {{is referred to as}} a public carrier (or simply as a carrier). However, public carrier in continental Europe is different from public carrier in British English, where it is a synonym for <b>contract</b> <b>carrier.</b>|$|E

After the repair work is done, the gunsmith or the factory can ship the gun {{directly}} back to the customer.|$|E
50|$|With {{the end of}} the war, the Air Transport Command {{found itself}} in limbo. Senior USAAF {{authorities}} considered ATC to be a wartime necessity that was no longer needed, and expected its civilian personnel, including former airline pilots, to return to their peacetime occupations. Senior ATC officers, on the other hand, thought that ATC should be developed into a national government operated airline, an idea that was soundly opposed by the airline industry. While the war had firmly established the necessity of a troop carrier mission, most military officers believed the role performed by ATC should be provided by <b>contract</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|R
50|$|AirMed International, LLC, {{based in}} Birmingham, Alabama, is {{a fee for}} service air {{ambulance}} airline. The company was founded in 1987 as MEDjet International and renamed AirMed International in 2003. AirMed offers international service to all countries except for Iraq, North Korea, and Libya. The company formerly managed the fixed-wing component of Mayo MedAir, the air medical services for the Mayo Clinic, until Mayo dropped the contract and is now operating their own airplane. AirMed is also a <b>contracted</b> <b>carrier</b> for the U.S. Department of Defense. AirMed holds accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Systems (CAMTS) and the European Aero-medical Institute.|$|R
50|$|AMC analysts then {{continue}} to monitor the carrier's safety record, operations and maintenance status, contract performance, financial condition and management initiatives, summarizing significant trends in a comprehensive review every six months. In addition to this in-depth review, {{there are several other}} surveillance initiatives. These include safety preflight inspections of commercial aircraft by Department of Defense designated inspectors, periodic cockpit observations on operational flights by highly experienced pilots from AMC's Department of Defense Commercial Airlift Division, and an increase in the frequency of on-site surveys. These initiatives and the surveys are further supplemented by an open flow of information on all <b>contract</b> <b>carriers</b> between AMC and the FAA through established liaison officers.|$|R
50|$|The tramp ship is a <b>contract</b> <b>carrier.</b> Unlike a liner, {{often called}} a common carrier, {{which has a}} fixed {{schedule}} and a published tariff, the ideal tramp can carry anything to anywhere, and freight rates are influenced by supply and demand. To generate business, a contract to lease the vessel known as a charter party is drawn up between the ship owner and the charterer. There are three types of charters, voyage, time and demise.|$|E
50|$|The {{services}} were phased out {{due to a}} number of reasons that included lack of ridership, a lack of funding outside the five-country area, withdrawal of Conrail as a <b>contract</b> <b>carrier,</b> a small pool of aging equipment that needed replacement, and a lack of SEPTA-owned diesel maintenance infrastructure. The death knell for any resumption of diesel service was the Center City Commuter Connection tunnel project, which lacks the necessary ventilation for exhaust-producing locomotives.|$|E

50|$|C.H. Robinson’s {{entry into}} the {{trucking}} business came after the Federal Highway Act of 1956 expanded interstate commerce and the roadways of America. C.H. Robinson and other shippers had previously relied on trains to transport goods. In 1968, the firm entered the regulated truck business as a <b>contract</b> <b>carrier</b> named Meat Packers Express based in Omaha, Nebraska. Robco Transportation Inc. was formed by merging Meat Packers Express with additional carriers three years later and was sold in 1986.|$|E
50|$|The Motor Carrier Act of 1980 {{deregulated}} transportation {{industries in}} America and increased competition for logistics providers and shippers. C.H. Robinson created a <b>contract</b> <b>carrier</b> program, expanded its freight contract operations, and established {{itself as a}} middleman sourcing operation for virtually all shippable goods. The company’s average annual growth, measured by truckloads, doubled and C.H. Robinson posted more than $700 million in sale within five years. Forty per cent was generated by truck brokerage, with the remainder of revenue coming from produce sales.|$|E
50|$|Big Sky {{operated}} scheduled commuter {{passenger services}} to ten cities and maintained a hub at Billings Logan International Airport in Billings, Montana, {{from which the}} airline flew more of its nonstop routes than it did from any other airport. The airline was a crucial air link within the state of Montana, serving as the primary (and in some cases, only) commercial air carrier to several small airports in the state. The airline also began and ended service {{to a number of}} other locations over the years, often operating as a <b>contract</b> <b>carrier</b> under the federal government's Essential Air Service (EAS) program.|$|E
50|$|Scope clauses place {{restrictions}} {{on how many}} and what size of aircraft a regional airline may operate.

5000|$|Private {{carriage}} usually {{refers to}} trucking, {{but is also}} found in rail and water transportation, as well as communication. Private carriage is distinguished from independent carrier, which is an individual owner-operator or trucker who may make deals with private <b>carriers,</b> common <b>carriers,</b> <b>contract</b> <b>carriers,</b> or others as he or she wishes. Private carrier may also refer to communication or communication services. Certain frequencies which are restricted to use by law enforcement are sometimes called [...] "private carriers". Station class codes beginning with FB6 or FB7 are private carriers. In the telecommunications industry, defining [...] "private carrier" [...] and [...] "common carrier" [...] has become increasingly difficult with the growth of mobile phone service providers, VOIP, and other non-traditional means of delivering communication services.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Freight forwarders' {{aggregate}} shipments from {{a variety}} of sources to be put on common or <b>contract</b> <b>carriers</b> for transportation. Such entities are also commonly called transportation brokers. They perform two basic economic functions. One is making matches between transport demands and transport capacity on a flexible basis, calling on whatever carriers are available at a given time and place instead of being limited to the capabilities on just one or a few carrier organizations. The second function is providing a means of aggregating, or massing, a number of small demands from different entities into shipment sizes which can be efficiently and economically transported. This capacity allows smaller shippers to obtain transport arrangements more nearly equivalent to the arrangements available to larger shippers.|$|R
5000|$|Mountain Air Cargo (MAC) is an American cargo airline {{based in}} Denver, North Carolina. It {{is a major}} <b>contract</b> <b>carrier</b> for FedEx Express, {{operating}} in the eastern United States and the Caribbean region.

Its main maintenance facility is at Kinston Regional Jetport. [...] All of the ATR and C208 aircraft operated by Mountain Air are owned by Fedex Express, and are operated by MAC on a [...] "dry lease" [...] basis.|$|E
5000|$|On August 21, 2009, an {{incident}} occurred where passengers {{were forced to}} stay on a parked plane at Rochester, Minnesota for six hours with no food and overflowing toilets. The airline crew tried over thirty times to call the <b>contract</b> <b>carrier,</b> Delta Connection, (which services the Rochester airport) to let the passengers off. The agents for the regional Mesaba Airlines refused. The Department of Transportation cited {{the main cause of}} the incident as the Mesaba Airlines station's refusal to park the aircraft. [...] However, Continental Airlines and ExpressJet were also fined for the part they played in the incident.|$|E

50|$|Arrow <b>contracted</b> other <b>carriers</b> {{to handle}} its {{business}} during the crisis. British Airways, for example, handled the route between Columbus, Ohio, and Glasgow, Scotland.

5|$|Following the C-5 crash, {{and with}} the cause still unknown, the C-5 fleet was {{grounded}} and the MAC airlift was reduced to using C-141s and C-130s; rather than loading as many evacuees as possible, each evacuee required a seat and a seatbelt, {{reducing the number of}} passengers that could be carried on each flight. Each C-141 would carry 94 passengers while each C-130 would carry 75, although these restrictions were relaxed, and then ignored altogether as the pace of the evacuation quickened. Armed guards were also present on each flight to prevent the possibility of hijacking. American commercial and <b>contract</b> <b>carriers</b> continued to fly out of Tan Son Nhut, but with decreasing frequency. In addition, military aircraft from Australia, Indonesia, Iran, Poland, UK, France, and other countries flew in to evacuate their embassy personnel.|$|R
40|$|Federal {{regulators}} recently allowed {{natural gas}} pipelines to offer transmission services to their customers. Pipelines previously were merchant carriers that were required by regulatory decree {{to own the}} gas they transported. Now, pipelines can voluntarily choose to function as pure transportation firms (<b>contract</b> <b>carriers)</b> and their customers can use transportation to buy gas from suppliers connected to the pipeline network. A major aim {{of this research is}} {{to determine the extent to}} which pipelines have become interconnected transporters of gas and how competition works in an interconnected transmission network. The institutions created by market participants and the transactions that they now can make are examined in detail. Monthly and daily spot gas field prices are examined. The empirical results lead to the conclusion that pipeline transportation created a national market for natural gas...|$|R
