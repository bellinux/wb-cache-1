40|$|Corrosion {{protection}} of fully grouted rock bolts {{has been the}} subject of considerable research in recent years. Corrosion protection is studied focusing on quantitatively determining how much encapsulation coating affect the bolt/resin bond capacity. Resin coating results in reduction of rib height and in turn causes a decrease in interlocking effect with the grout annulus. The laboratory tests performed have shown that there was a wide range of reduction in bonding strength (from 5 to 40 %), depending on the type of the bolt and media in which the bolt had been installed. The reduction of rib height was also responsible for lower lateral dilation during bolt pullout tests. This effect will make the <b>confining</b> <b>medium</b> become an important parameter, since higher <b>confining</b> <b>medium</b> results in higher confining pressure on the bolt surface which in turn, controls the bond capacity...|$|E

Cooling of the jet material along such a flow increases Mach number and relative density relative to the <b>confining</b> <b>medium,</b> as distance from the origin increases; this leads to a rather rapid decrease in the maximum rate of growth and an increase in the maximally unstable wavelength, relative to the jet's radius, as the distance along such a jet increases.

Although boundaries between the different processes of synthesis are very tight, the in situ process can be subdivided into two groups, namely, (i) sorption followed by a redox and/or precipitation reaction, and (ii) impregnation followed by a precipitation and/or redox reaction. Sorption is followed by an in situ redox and/or precipitation reaction (Sarkar et al. 2012). In impregnation of the metal ion or the metal precursor does not involve any chemical interaction between the functional groups of the functional polymer, the metal ions, or a metal precursor.

The µLSF is a micro-plastic forming method {{with the}} laser-induced shock load {{generated}} by the plasma in <b>confined</b> <b>medium.</b> It is characterized in the high-pressure and ultra-high strain ratio.

It showed that there exists a threshold for magnitude of the laser energy. The forming depth increased {{with the increase of}} magnitude when the magnitude was smaller than the threshold. However, it decreased with the increase of magnitude when the magnitude was larger than the threshold. When the magnitude of the laser energy was chosen, the forming depth presented non-linear reduction with the increase of sheet thickness. ...|$|R

However, in real batteries, lithiation occurs simultaneously in clusters of Si in a <b>confined</b> <b>medium.</b> Hence, understanding how the individual Si structures interact during lithiation in a closed space is necessary. Here, we demonstrate physical and mechanical interactions of swelling Si structures during lithiation using well-defined Si nanopillar pairs. Ex situ SEM and in situ TEM studies reveal that compressive stresses change the reaction kinetics so that preferential lithiation occurs at free surfaces when the pillars are mechanically clamped. Such mechanical interactions enhance the fracture resistance of lithiated Si by lessening the tensile stress concentrations in Si structures. This study will contribute to improved design of Si structures at the electrode level for high-performance Li-ion batteries. open 1...|$|R

40|$|In this note, {{the profile}} {{concentration}} of diffusing particles inside a membrane has been calculated {{on the basis}} of the Fick diffusion equation modified by introducing a memory formalism. In highly heterogeneous systems, such as biological membranes, the intrinsic structural complexity of the medium restricts the applicability of continuum diffusion models and suggests that diffusion parameters could depend at a certain time or position on what happens at preceding times (diffusion with memory). Here, we deal with two particular cases, the diffusion of glucose across an erythrocyte membrane, when the concentration at both sides of the membrane are assigned, and the permeation transport of small molecular weight solute through an artificial hydrogel polymeric membrane. However, the present procedure can be easily extended to more general conditions. The knowledge of the concentration profile within a membranous structure, which is usually not easily experimentally accessible, completes the description of the rather complex phenomenon of the transport across a highly structured <b>confined</b> <b>medium</b> and can also lead to an improvement in controlled drug-delivery systems.

In this work, we have studied the growth of calcium carbonate particles on well-defined organic matrices that were formed by layer-by-layer (LbL) polyelectrolyte films deposited on phospholipid Langmuir-Blodgett films (LB). We were able to change the surface electrical charge density of the LB films by changing the proportions of a negatively charged lipid, the sodium salt of dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidyl acid (DMPA), and a zwitterionic lipid. dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE). This affects the subsequent polyelectrolyte LbL film deposition, which also changes the the nature of the bonding (electrostatic interaction or hydrogen bonding). This approach allowed for the formation of calcium carbonate particles of different final shapes, roughnesses, and sizes.

A transport model that assimilates the confinement {{to the presence of}} entropic barriers provides an efficient approach to quantify its effect on the particle current and the diffusion coefficient. We review the main peculiarities of entropic transport and treat two cases in which confinement effects play a crucial role, with the appearance of emergent properties. The presence of entropic barriers modifies the mean first-passage time distribution and therefore plays a very important role in ion transport through micro- and nano-channels. The functionality of molecular motors, modeled as Brownian ratchets, is strongly affected when the motor proceeds in a <b>confined</b> <b>medium</b> that may constitute another source of rectification.

If high power densities are used the recoil pressure can be high enough to induce compressive residual stresses on the target surface and to modify its mechanical properties.

40|$|We {{consider}} delayed, volumetric heating in a magnetized outflow {{that has}} broken {{out of a}} <b>confining</b> <b>medium</b> and expanded to a high Lorentz factor (Γ∼ 10 ^ 2 - 10 ^ 3) and low optical depth to scattering (τ_ T∼ 10 ^- 3 - 10 ^- 2). The energy flux at breakout {{is dominated by the}} magnetic field, with a modest contribution from quasi-thermal gamma rays whose spectrum was calculated in Paper I. We focus on the case of extreme baryon depletion in the magnetized material, but allow for a separate baryonic component that is entrained from a <b>confining</b> <b>medium.</b> Dissipation is driven by relativistic motion between these two components, which develops once the photon compactness drops below 4 × 10 ^ 3 (Y_e/ 0. 5) ^- 1. We first calculate the acceleration of the magnetized component following breakout, showing that embedded MHD turbulence provides significant inertia, the neglect of which leads to unrealistically high estimates of flow Lorentz factor. After re-heating begins, the pair and photon distributions are evolved self-consistently using a one-zone kinetic code that incorporates an exact treatment of Compton scattering, pair production and annihilation, and Coulomb scattering. Heating leads to a surge in pair creation, and the scattering depth saturates at τ_ T∼ 1 - 4. The plasma maintains a very low ratio of particle to magnetic pressure, and can support strong anisotropy in the charged particle distribution, with cooling dominated by Compton scattering. High-energy power-law spectra with photon indices in the range observed in GRBs (- 3 < β < - 3 / 2) are obtained by varying the ratio of heat input to the seed energy in quasi-thermal photons. We contrast our results with those for continuous heating across an expanding photosphere, and show that the latter model produces soft-hard evolution that is inconsistent with observations of GRBs.
