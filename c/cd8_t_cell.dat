50|$|CD8+ (CD8 positive) cell {{commonly}} {{refers to}} a T cell that expresses CD8 on its cells surface. Usually the terms CD8+, CD8+ cell, <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell,</b> and cytotoxic T cell are interchangeable.|$|E
50|$|The first {{evidence}} of cross-presentation {{was reported in}} 1976 by Michael J. Bevan after injection of cells carrying alloantigens into experimental animals. This resulted in <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> responses that were induced by antigen-presenting cells of the recipient, implying that these must have taken up and processed the injected cells. This observation was termed “cross-priming”.|$|E
50|$|This {{disorder}} {{is considered a}} combined immunodeficiency because it includes both decreased lymphocyte numbers and defective lymphocyte function. It can also be classified {{as a type of}} autosomal recessive hyperimmunoglobulinemia E syndrome. Laboratory manifestations include progressive lymphopenia that primarily affects CD4 and <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> subsets, reduced B cell and/or NK cell counts in some patients, eosinophilia, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Antibody responses to vaccines are frequently poor. Loss of Dock8 protein expression can be demonstrated by diagnostic intracellular flow cytometry testing.|$|E

5000|$|Mice models {{deficient}} for the β2 microglobulin gene {{have been}} engineered. These mice demonstrate that β2 microglobulin {{is necessary for}} cell surface expression of MHC class I and stability of the peptide binding groove. In fact, {{in the absence of}} β2 microglobulin, very limited amounts of MHC class I (classical and non-classical) molecules can be detected on the surface. In the absence of MHC class I, <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> cannot develop. (<b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> are a subset of <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> involved in the development of acquired immunity.) ...|$|R
50|$|Inovio is {{developing}} a synthetic multi-antigen DNA vaccine covering hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1a and 1b and targeting the HCV antigens nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) and 4A (NS4A), as well as NS4B and NS5A proteins. Inovio has the intent to initiate a phase I/IIa clinical study {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2013. Following immunization, rhesus macaques mounted strong HCV-specific T cell immune responses strikingly similar to those reported in patients who have cleared the virus on their own. The responses included strong HCV antigen-specific interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-2 (IL-2) induction, robust CD4 and <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation, and induction of polyfunctional T cells.|$|E
5000|$|Aside from {{dendritic}} cells, additional cell {{populations were}} identified, that {{are able to}} induce antigen-specific T cell tolerance. These are mainly the members of lymph node stromal cells (LNSCs). LNSCs are generally divided into several sub-populations based on the expression of gp38 (PDPN) and CD31 surface markers. Among those, only fibroblastic reticular cells and lymph node stromal cells were shown {{to play a role in}} the peripheral tolerance. Both of those populations are able to induce <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> tolerance by presentation of the endogenous antigens on MHCI molecules [...] and even the CD4 T cell tolerance by the presentation of the peptide-MHCII complexes, which they acquired from the DCs.|$|E
50|$|Some self-antigens (autoantigens) are cross-presented, {{resulting}} in the elimination of autoreactive <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> This mechanism to maintain self tolerance has been termed cross-tolerance.|$|R

50|$|At an {{equivalent}} dose a trifunctional antibody is more potent (more than 1,000-fold) in eliminating tumor cells than conventional antibodies. These drugs evoke {{the removal of}} tumor cells by means of (i) antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytoxicity, a process also described for conventional antibodies and more importantly by (ii) polyclonal cytotoxic <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> responses with emphasis on <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> These trifunctional antibodies also elicit individual anti-tumor immune responses in cancer patients treated with e.g. catumaxomab; i.e. autologous antibodies as well as CD4 and <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> directed against the tumor were detected. Furthermore, putative cancer stem cells from malignant ascites fluid were eliminated due to catumaxomab treatment.|$|R
50|$|While in {{most cases}} {{activation}} is dependent on TCR recognition of antigen, alternative pathways for activation have been described. For example, cytotoxic <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> {{have been shown to}} become activated when targeted by other <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> leading to tolerization of the latter.|$|R

50|$|In August 2007 Immutep {{announced}} its {{involvement in a}} Phase I study being conducted at the University Hospital of Lausanne in Switzerland where a group was working on adoptive <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> transfer after transient lymphodepletion associated with peptide vaccination. This study recruited 12 patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00324623, Immutep code name P007) where the patient's lymphocytes were depleted using chemotherapy, after which patients were given their own peripheral mononuclear cells, enriched with tumour-specific <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> During the immune reconstitution period the patients were given a cancer vaccine containing a peptide melanoma antigen called MART1, adjuvanted with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant and, in half the patients, IMP321. While there was no confirmed responses as per the RECIST criteria for the 12 patients recruited, the investigators noted a significant expansion of MART-1-specific <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in the IMP321 group, where {{there was also a}} higher proportions of effector cells and a significantly reduced expansion of regulatory <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> These results were published in the Journal of Translational Medicine in April 2014.|$|R
50|$|In a {{mouse model}} of {{intracellular}} infection, L. monocytogenes induced PD-L1 protein expression in <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> NK cells, and macrophages. PD-L1 blockade (using blocking antibodies) resulted in increased mortality for infected mice. Blockade reduced TNFα and nitric oxide production by macrophages, reduced granzyme B production by NK cells, and decreased proliferation of L. monocytogenes antigen-specific <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> (but not CD4 <b>T</b> <b>cells).</b> This {{evidence suggests that}} PD-L1 acts as a positive costimulatory molecule in intracellular infection.|$|R

5000|$|Cross-presentation is {{the ability}} of certain antigen-presenting cells to take up, process and present {{extracellular}} antigens with MHC class I molecules to <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> (cytotoxic <b>T</b> <b>cells).</b> Cross-priming, the result of this process, describes the naive cytotoxic CD8+ <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> stimulation. This process is necessary for immunity against most tumors and against viruses that do not readily infect antigen-presenting cells, or impair dendritic cell normal function [...] It is also required for induction of cytotoxic immunity by vaccination with protein antigens, for example, tumour vaccination.|$|R

50|$|The unphosphorylated moiety of fingolimod, {{which is}} the {{predominant}} form of the drug in the body, is also an active molecule. Unphosphorylated fingolimod impairs the ability of cytotoxic <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> to kill their target cells by a different mechanism that involves the arachidonic acid pathway, which is unrelated to sphigosine phosphate receptors. This has implications to both increasing susceptibility to viral infections as well as enhancing its therapeutic efficacy in multiple sclerosis.|$|R
25|$|Two {{commonly}} used CD molecules are CD4 and CD8, which are, in general, used as markers for helper and cytotoxic <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> respectively. These molecules are defined {{in combination with}} CD3+, as some other leukocytes also express these CD molecules (some macrophages express low levels of CD4; dendritic cells express high levels of CD8). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) binds CD4 and a chemokine receptor {{on the surface of}} a <b>T</b> helper <b>cell</b> to gain entry. The number of CD4 and <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in blood is often used to monitor the progression of HIV infection.|$|R
50|$|The {{association}} of AS with HLA-B27 suggests the condition involves <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> which interact with HLA-B. This interaction is not proven to involve a self-antigen, {{and at least}} in the related reactive arthritis, which follows infections, the antigens involved are likely to be derived from intracellular microorganisms. There is, however, a possibility that CD4+ T lymphocytes are involved in an aberrant way, since HLA-B27 appears to have a number of unusual properties, including possibly an ability to interact with <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptors in association with CD4 (usually CD8+ cytotoxic <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> with HLAB antigen as it is a MHC class 1 antigen).|$|R
50|$|The role of CD4+ <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in {{antitumor}} immunity is controversial. It {{was suggested}} that CD4+ <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> {{can have a}} direct role in antitumor immunity through direct recognition of tumor antigens presented {{on the surface of}} tumor cells in association with MHC class II molecules. Of note, results from recent reports suggest that direct recognition of tumors from tumor-antigen specific CD4+ <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> might not be always beneficial. For example, it was recently shown that CD4+ <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> primarily produce TNF after recognition of tumor-antigens in melanoma. TNF may in turn increase local immunosuppression and impair the effector functions of <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> (Donia M. et al., 2015).|$|R
50|$|Evidence also {{suggests}} that <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> lymphocyte <b>cells</b> mediate protection against Yersinia by production of cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF-alpha and gamma interferon IFN) and by killing bacteria-associated host cells to promote internalization by neighbouring phagocytes.|$|R
50|$|In HIV {{infected}} subjects, IL-21 {{has been}} reported to critically improve the HIV-specific cytotoxic <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> responses and NK cell functions. It has also been shown that HIV-specific CD4 <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> from “HIV controllers” (rare individuals who don’t progress to AIDS by controlling the virus replication without treatment) are able to produce significantly more IL-21 than those of progressors. In addition, IL-21 producing virus specific <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> were also preferentially found in HIV controllers. These data and the fact that IL-21 stimulated CD8 or NK cells are able to inhibit HIV viral replication in vitro, show that this cytokine could potentially be useful for anti-HIV therapeutics.|$|R
25|$|THαβ {{helper cells}} provide the host {{immunity}} against viruses. Their differentiation is triggered by IFN α/β or IL-10. Their key effector cytokine is IL-10. Their main effector cells are NK cells {{as well as}} <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> IgG B cells, and IL-10 CD4 <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> The key THαβ transcription factors are STAT1 and STAT3 as well as IRFs. IL-10 from CD4 <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> activate NK cells' ADCC to apoptose virus-infected cells and to induce host as well as viral DNA fragmentation. IFN alpha/beta can suppress transcription to avoid virus replication and transmission. Overactivation of THαβ against autoantigen will cause type 2 antibody-dependent cytotoxic hypersensitivity. Myasthenia gravis or Graves' disease belong to this category.|$|R
25|$|Th1 {{helper cells}} are the host {{immunity}} effectors against intracellular bacteria and protozoa. They are triggered by IL-12, IL-2 and their effector cytokine is IFN-γ. The main effector cells of Th1 immunity are macrophages {{as well as}} <b>CD8</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> IgG B cells, and IFN-γ CD4 <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> The key Th1 transcription factors are STAT4 and T-bet. IFN-γ secreted by CD4 <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> can activate macrophages to phagocytose and digest intracellular bacteria and protozoa. In addition, IFN-γ can activate iNOS to produce NOx free radicals to directly kill intracellular bacteria and protozoa. Th1 overactivation against autoantigens will cause Type 4 delayed-type hypersensitivity. Tuberculin reaction or Type 1 diabetes belong to this category of autoimmunity.|$|R
