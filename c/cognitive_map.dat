5|$|In Plans and the Structure of Behavior, Miller and his co-authors {{tried to}} explain through an artificial-intelligence {{computational}} perspective how animals plan and act. This was a radical break from behaviorism which explained behavior as a set or sequence of stimulus-response actions. The authors introduced a planning element controlling such actions. They saw all plans as being executed based on input using a stored or inherited information of the environment (called the image), and using a strategy called test-operate-test-exit (TOTE). The image was essentially a stored memory of all past context, akin to Tolman's <b>cognitive</b> <b>map.</b> The TOTE strategy, in its initial test phase, compared the input against the image; if there was incongruity the operate function attempted to reduce it. This cycle would be repeated till the incongruity vanished, and then the exit function would be invoked, passing control to another TOTE unit in a hierarchically arranged scheme.|$|E
25|$|Hermer and Spelke (1994) {{determined}} that when toddlers begin to walk, around eighteen months, they navigate by {{their sense of}} the world's layout. Indeed, {{it would seem that}} a sojourning toddler's world is a place of axial lines and contrasting boundaries. McNamara, Hardy and Hirtle identified region membership as a major building block of anyone's <b>cognitive</b> <b>map</b> (1989). Specifically, region membership is defined by any kind of boundary, whether physical, perceptual or subjective (McNamara et al., 1989). Boundaries are among the most basic and endemic qualities in the world around us. These boundaries are nothing more than axial lines which are a feature that people are biased towards when relating to space; for example one axial line determinant is gravity (McNamara & Shelton, 2001; Kim & Penn, 2004). Axial lines aid everyone in apportioning our perceptions into regions. This parceled world idea is further supported items by the finding that items that get recalled together are more likely than not to also be clustered within the same region of one's larger <b>cognitive</b> <b>map.</b> Clustering shows that people tend to chunk information together according to smaller layouts within a larger <b>cognitive</b> <b>map.</b>|$|E

25|$|The place {{cells that}} appear to operate based solely on non-spatial memory seem to have spatial components. Many lesioning {{experiments}} attempting to inflict non-spatial memory deficits in the hippocampus have been unsuccessful. In some cases, lesioning {{has been successful in}} inflicting non-spatial memory deficits, however, other structures besides the hippocampus were affected by lesioning. Therefore, the rat's non-spatial memory deficits could have been unrelated to place cells. Thus, based on information from studies thus far, the <b>cognitive</b> <b>map</b> theory seems to be most supported and non-spatial theories may fail to take spatial components into account.|$|E
25|$|In {{cognitive}} psychology and neuroscience, spatial memory {{is the part}} of memory responsible for recording information about one's environment and spatial orientation. For example, a person's spatial memory is required in order to navigate around a familiar city, just as a rat's spatial memory is needed to learn the location of food {{at the end of a}} maze. It is often argued that in both humans and animals, spatial memories are summarized as a <b>cognitive</b> <b>map.</b> Spatial memory has representations within working, short-term memory and long-term memory. Research indicates that there are specific areas of the brain associated with spatial memory. Many methods are used for measuring spatial memory in children, adults, and animals.|$|E
25|$|The visuo-spatial sketchpad {{is part of}} Baddeley and Hitch’s {{model of}} working memory. It is {{responsible}} for temporarily storing visual and spatial information, which is currently being used or encoded. It is {{thought of as a}} three-dimensional <b>cognitive</b> <b>map,</b> which contains spatial features about where the person is and visual images of the area, or an object being concentrated on. It is used in tasks such as mental image manipulation where a person imagines how a real object would look if it were changed in some way (rotated, flipped, moved, change of colour, etc.). It is also responsible for representing how vivid an image is. A vivid image is one which you have a high potential for retrieving its sensory details. The visuo-spatial sketchpad is responsible for holding onto the visual and spatial qualities of a vivid image in your working memory, and the degree of vividness is directly affected by the limits of the sketchpad.|$|E

500|$|The third {{important}} {{theory of}} hippocampal function relates the hippocampus to space. The spatial theory was originally championed by O'Keefe and Nadel, who {{were influenced by}} E.C. Tolman's theories about [...] "cognitive maps" [...] in humans and animals. [...] O'Keefe and his student Dostrovsky in 1971 discovered neurons in the rat hippocampus that appeared to them to show activity related to the rat's location within its environment. [...] Despite skepticism from other investigators, O'Keefe and his co-workers, especially Lynn Nadel, continued to investigate this question, {{in a line of}} work that eventually led to their very influential 1978 book The Hippocampus as a <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Map.</b> [...] There is now almost universal agreement that hippocampal function {{plays an important role in}} spatial coding, but the details are widely debated.|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} navigational {{cells in the}} brain that are either in the {{hippocampus}} itself or are strongly connected to it, such as the speed cells present in the medial entorhinal cortex. Together these cells form a network that serves as spatial memory. The first of such cells discovered in the 1970s were the place cells, {{which led to the}} idea of the hippocampus acting to give a neural representation of the environment in a <b>cognitive</b> <b>map.</b> When the hippocampus is dysfunctional, orientation is affected; people may have difficulty in remembering how they arrived at a location and how to proceed further. Getting lost is a common symptom of amnesia. Studies with animals have shown that an intact hippocampus is required for initial learning and long-term retention of some spatial memory tasks, in particular ones that require finding the way to a hidden goal. Other cells have been discovered since the finding of the place cells in the rodent brain that are either in the hippocampus or the entorhinal cortex. These have been assigned as head direction cells, grid cells and boundary cells. [...] Speed cells are thought to provide input to the hippocampal grid cells.|$|E
500|$|Every November, Vukovar's {{authorities}} hold {{four days}} of festivities to commemorate the town's fall, culminating in a [...] "Procession of Memory" [...] held on 18 November. This represents the expulsion of the town's Croat inhabitants and involves a five-kilometre (3.1 mile) walk from the city's hospital to the Croatian Memorial Cemetery of Homeland War Victims. It is attended by {{tens of thousands of}} people from across Croatia. Local Serbs have avoided participating in the Croatian commemorations, often preferring either to leave the town or stay indoors on 18 November. Until 2003, they held a separate, low-key commemoration at the Serbian military cemetery on 17 November. Such commemorations have been held on 18 November since then. The RSK-era term [...] "Liberation Day" [...] has been dropped, but Serbs also avoid using the Croatian terminology, instead calling it simply [...] "18 November". The issue of how to remember the Serb dead has posed particular difficulties. Local Serbs who died fighting alongside the JNA were buried by the Croatian Serb authorities on a plot of land where Croatian houses had once stood. The gravestones were originally topped with a sculptural evocation of the V-shaped Serbian military cap, or šajkača. After Vukovar's reintegration into Croatia, the gravestones were repeatedly vandalised. The Serb community replaced them with more neutral gravestones without overt military connotations. Vukovar Serbs report feeling marginalised and excluded from places associated with Croatian nationalist sentiment, such as war monuments. The Croatian sociologist Kruno Kardov gives the example of a prominent memorial, a large cross made from white stone, where the Vuka flows into the Danube. According to Kardov, Serbs rarely if ever go there, and they feel great stress if they do. A Serb boy spoke of how he wanted to know what was written on the monument but was too frightened to go and read the inscription; one day he got up the courage, ran to the monument, read it and immediately ran back to [...] "safety". As Kardov puts it, Vukovar remains divided by an [...] "invisible boundary line ... inscribed only on the <b>cognitive</b> <b>map</b> of the members of one particular group." ...|$|E
