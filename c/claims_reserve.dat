40|$|As {{commonly}} known, {{to evaluate}} the <b>claims</b> <b>reserve</b> (otherwise known as the provision for outstanding claims), the loss adjuster uses as a first component the <b>claims</b> <b>reserve</b> given by {{the sum of the}} estimated provision for each outstanding claim (known as case reserve). Traditional statistical-actuarial methods are used to control and/or asseverate the evaluation and recent developments have tended to ensure that these enable an independent assessment of the <b>claims</b> <b>reserve.</b> In some European countries, a large subset of motor liability claims is managed within a direct reimbursement (DR) scheme. In Italy, the introduction of the direct compensation CARD system for third-party liability insurance has resulted in greater attention in the use of these traditional methods due to the heterogeneity of the data available for evaluations. This paper presents the results of a study undertaken to define a calculation method that, using the different assumptions that describe the evolution of settlement mechanisms, is able to quantify the <b>claims</b> <b>reserve.</b> The proposed methodology reduces the loss adjuster’s discretion in applying statistical methods since all assumptions must be made explicit and can hence be monitored and controlled. Furthermore, a stress test can be performed on all the parameters that influence the settlement and thus the <b>claims</b> <b>reserve.</b> Finally, in a backtesting perspective, the proposed methodology enables an ex-post analysis of actual cash flow deviations compared to expected values, identifying the variables that lead to these differences. In particular, a calculation method is presented that using the different assumptions describing the evolution of the settlement of different claim handling procedures (Non-Card, Card, Handler Forfait and Debtor Forfait) is able to quantify the <b>claims</b> <b>reserve.</b> Via simulations, future payments, the expected value of the <b>claims</b> <b>reserve</b> and some indicators of variability are also estimated. The numerical application allows comparing the results obtained with those deriving from the application of traditional statistical methods. The problem of aggregating the four claim handling procedures is dealt with by using copulas with the goal of building a single distribution of the aggregate <b>claims</b> <b>reserve.</b> Furthermore, in a Solvency II perspective, the capital requirement is determined against the reserve risk based on the internal model proposed and is compared with the standard formula proposed by EIOPA...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{stochastic}} model for <b>claims</b> <b>reserving</b> that allows to combine claims payments and incurred losses information.

Using a Bayesian point of view for the parameter modelling we derive in this Bayesian PIC model the full predictive distribution of the outstanding loss liabilities.

The RJMCMC method described in this paper represents an improvement over the manual processes often employed in practice.

40|$|The claims reserving {{problem is}} {{currently}} {{one of the}} most debated in actuarial literature. The high level of interest in this topic {{is due to the fact}} that Solvency II rules will come into operation in 2014. Indeed, it is expected that quantile computations will be compulsory in the evaluation of company risk and for this reason we think that the construction of the <b>claims</b> <b>reserve</b> random variable distribution assumes a fundamental relevance. The aim of this paper is to present a method for constructing the <b>claims</b> <b>reserve</b> distribution which can take into account IBNyR (Issued But Not yet Reported) claims in a natural way. The construction of the distribution function for each time of the observed interval is done by means of a Monte Carlo simulation model applied on a backward time semi-Markov process. It should be pointed out that this is the first time that a simulation model based on semi-Markov with backward recurrence time has been presented. The method is totally different from the models given in the current literature. The most important features given in the paper are: 1) for the first time the Monte Carlo simulation method is applied to a backward semi-Markov environment; 2) the Monte Carlo simulation permits the construction of the random variable of the <b>claims</b> <b>reserve</b> for each year of the studied horizon in a natural way; 3) as already pointed out, the backward process attached to the semi-Markov process permits taking into account the evaluation of the IBNyR claims in a natural way.

40|$|The Benktander (1976) and Neuhaus (1992) {{credibility}} claims reserving {{methods are}} reconsidered {{in the framework}} of a credible loss ratio reserving method. As a main contribution we provide a simple and practical optimal credibility weight for combining the chain-ladder or individual loss ratio reserve (grossed up latest claims experience of an origin period) with the Bornhuetter-Ferguson or collective loss ratio reserve (experience based burning cost estimate of the total ultimate claims of an origin period). The obtained simple optimal credibility weights minimize simultaneously the mean squared error and the variance of the <b>claims</b> <b>reserve.</b> We note also that the standard Chain-Ladder, Cape Cod and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods can be reinterpreted in the credible context and extended to optimal credible standard methods. The new approach is inspired from Mack (2000). Two advantages over the Mack method are worthwhile to be mentioned. First, a pragmatic estimation of the required parameters leads to a straightforward calculation of the optimal credibility weights and mean squared errors of the credible reserves. An advantage of the collective loss ratio <b>claims</b> <b>reserve</b> over the Bornhuetter-Ferguson reserve in Mack (2000) is that different actuaries come always to the same results provided they use the same actuarial premium...|$|E
40|$|In old {{accounting}} tradition, {{non-life insurance}} companies have estimated nominal <b>claims</b> <b>reserves</b> for their outstanding loss liabilities. The new Solvency II developments require from non-life insurance companies that they go over to a market-consistent valuation of their insurance liabilities (full balance sheet approach) and that they prove solvency on a yearly basis. As a consequence non-life insurance companies need to consider discounted <b>claims</b> <b>reserves</b> {{and they need to}} yearly adjust these <b>claims</b> <b>reserves</b> for the outstanding loss liabilities according to the latest information available. In the present paper we study this one-year adjustment (one-year claims development result) for discounted <b>claims</b> <b>reserves</b> in a stochastic framework: For the purely insurance technical side the Bayes chain ladder model is used, the interest rate risk is described by an appropriate covariance matrix obtained from the Vasicek model. ...|$|R

40|$|A common {{approach}} to the <b>claims</b> <b>reserving</b> problem is based on generalized linear models (GLM). Within this framework, the claims in different origin and development years {{are assumed to be}} independent variables. If this assumption is violated, the classical techniques may provide incorrect predictions of the <b>claims</b> <b>reserves</b> or even misleading estimates of the prediction error. In this article, the application of generalized estimating equations (GEE) for estimation of the <b>claims</b> <b>reserves</b> is shown. <b>Claim</b> triangles are handled as panel data, where claim amounts within the same accident year are dependent. Since the GEE allow to incorporate dependencies, various correlation structures are introduced and some practical recommendations are given.

Moreover, an estimate for the mean square error of prediction for the <b>claims</b> <b>reserves</b> is derived in a nonstandard way and its advantages are discussed.

40|$|One of {{the main}} goals in {{non-life}} insurance is to estimate the <b>claims</b> <b>reserve</b> distribution. A generalized time series model, that allows for modeling the conditional mean and variance of the claim amounts, is proposed for the claims development. On contrary to the classical stochastic reserving techniques, the number of model parameters {{does not depend on}} the number of development periods, which leads to a more precise forecasting. Moreover, the time series innovations for the consecutive claims are not considered to be independent anymore. Conditional least squares are used for model parameter estimation and consistency of such estimate is proved. Copula approach is used for modeling the dependence structure, which improves the precision of the reserve distribution estimate as well. Real data examples are provided as an illustration of the potential benefits of the presented approach. Comment: Submitted on June 19, 201...|$|E

Specifically, the estimating process enables a company’s particular situation to be taken into account, by incorporating its approach to the consequences arising from estimation errors into the model.

For the bivariate situation, we have already developed robust solutions for the chain-ladder method by introducing two techniques for detecting and correcting outliers.

We show that a particular GLM allows obtaining the estimates of the claims development pattern suggested by Mack.

Therefore, insurers have to build up reserves enabling them to pay the outstanding claims and to meet claims arising in the future on the written contracts.
