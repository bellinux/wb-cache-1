2500|$|Graham [...] "Green" [...] Bailey, {{and would}} meet Steve Budd, closely {{involved}} with his band The Sound {{in their early}} years, in his early teens. Budd would later recall, [...] "We met when we were both 14. He {{was the only other}} kid I knew with an electric guitar. Even at 14 you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a genius". Borland played guitar left-handed.|$|E
2500|$|The Mikado {{has been}} admired by other composers. Dame Ethel Smyth wrote of Sullivan, [...] "One day he {{presented}} {{me with a}} copy of the full score of The Golden Legend, adding: 'I think this is the best thing I've done, don't you?' and when truth compelled me to say that in my opinion The Mikado is his masterpiece, he cried out: 'O you wretch!' But though he laughed, I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> disappointed." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} Jimmy had {{a little}} bit of trouble with the solo on [...] "Stairway to Heaven"... e hadn't completely figured it out. Nowadays you sometimes spend a whole day doing one thing. Back then, we never did that. We never spent a very long time recording anything. I remember sitting in the control room with Jimmy, he's standing there next to me and he'd done quite a few passes and it wasn't going anywhere. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> getting a bit paranoid and so I was getting paranoid. I turned around and said [...] "You're making me paranoid!" [...] And he said, [...] "No, you're making me paranoid!" [...] It was a silly circle of paranoia. Then bang! On the next take or two he ripped it out.|$|E
60|$|The {{second mate}} coughed, but Bill <b>could</b> <b>see</b> as <b>'e</b> <b>was</b> a bit pleased.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{the unfortunate}} {{individual}} came in sight. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> completely exhausted.|$|R
60|$|Again {{he looked}} where {{the waste of}} sea {{churning}} amongst the sunken rocks had <b>been.</b> <b>He</b> could hear the roaring of waters, the thunder of great waves beating on the iron-bound coast; but nothing <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>see.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> alone on the wild sea; in the dark.|$|R
60|$|But he {{grew tired}} of looking around, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{beginning}} to get frightened.|$|E
60|$|Coleyard tore it open hurriedly. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> agitated. His {{face grew}} white at once.|$|E
60|$|Mr. John came {{up by the}} car, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{in one of his}} moods.|$|E
60|$|Chauncey Dike {{stopped in}} his tracks and haw-hawed with laughter. But I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not very much pleased.|$|R
6000|$|... "Me! Me, of {{all people}} in the world!" [...] he {{repeated}} portentously. But I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> frightened. Such want of tact! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr Palliser!" [...] said she;--and {{though she}} made no scene, though she merely glanced upon him once, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> wrong.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} me very intently to see if I were mocking. He laughed. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> very much moved.|$|E
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> working rapidly {{with his}} hands. When he {{returned}} to me the sweat was heavy on his forehead.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Henry {{was in the}} steward's room, {{affecting}} employment, but I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> only {{impatient to}} hear of my errand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} George doubtfully. Harold {{looking down}} <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> holding the lantern {{above his head}} and staring at something very hard.|$|R
60|$|He {{nodded his}} head, {{and even in}} the gloom I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> smiling the gentle, wistful smile which I {{connected}} with him.|$|R
60|$|His {{face grew}} a trifle more animated; I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> recovering. The dumb stupor which had held his {{features}} rigid was passing away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah. Anybody <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a {{druggist}} {{from that}} line about the tinctures and syrups. It's a fine tribute to our profession." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{never looked}} up, though I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> getting excited under his dejection. He slapped the bench with his open palm.|$|E
60|$|Harmmed was the butler. When {{he entered}} I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> labouring under {{controlled}} excitement. He came {{at once to}} the point.|$|E
60|$|My ready {{acquiescence}} pleased him. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> relieved. I {{think he}} had expected me to jib {{at the prospect of}} actual work.|$|R
60|$|He {{placed the}} lantern upon an upright sack of mealies, and {{carefully}} balanced it before <b>he</b> answered. Jess <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{taking time to}} consider.|$|R
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> interested, and I {{knew that}} as I spoke {{he had looked}} {{through the window and}} seen the man writing the letter.|$|R
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not at ease, so I {{took his}} poor old {{wrinkled}} hand in mine {{and asked him}} to speak fully.|$|E
60|$|Jack was {{standing}} in the middle of the stall, and by the moonlight Tip <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> smiling just as jovially as ever.|$|E
60|$|He raised {{himself on}} his arms and crawled in with difficulty. His legs dragged after him. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in great pain. But still, he managed it.|$|E
60|$|I glanced {{towards the}} table. As I had expected, de Cartienne was {{watching}} us, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> straining every nerve to overhear our conversation.|$|R
60|$|She leant back in {{her chair}} and looked laughingly at the young man. She <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{genuinely}} cross, if at the same time slightly excited.|$|R
60|$|More {{than that}} Cummings would not say: but both the boys <b>could</b> plainly <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> very anxious, and all grew greatly distressed {{in mind as}} the hours wore on.|$|R
60|$|Now at this Laban grew angry, as I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{prone to}} do, and {{stretched}} out his hand as though to push Seti aside and seize Merapi.|$|E
6000|$|The Bellman himself {{they all}} praised to the skies-- [...] Such a carriage, such ease and such grace! [...] Such solemnity, too! One <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> wise, [...] The moment one looked in his face! ...|$|E
60|$|Uncle Ro laughed, but I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> confoundedly vexed; and, as I {{loved him}} {{with all my}} heart, though I did not love match-making, I turned the discourse, in a {{pleasant}} way, on our approaching departure.|$|E
60|$|He {{walked to}} the door, gave her another bow, and left the room, and Jane Gladys <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{laughing}} to himself as if very much amused.|$|R
6000|$|... "I trust so," [...] said Ben, but Bertha <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> losing {{hope and}} that his life was being darkened by the {{presence}} of the death angel.|$|R
60|$|He bowed, waved, and was {{off down}} the steps to his brougham. As he drove away, Lady Clara <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> already deeply absorbed in a paper-covered novel.|$|R
