40|$|Simultaneous {{occurrence}} of different harmful species in agricultural practice necessitates that different plant protection chemicals be applied {{at the same}} time (tank mix). Mix components differ in purpose, mode of action and/or formulation, while addition of nonpesticide components (complex fertilizers, adjuvants and wetting agents) is widely practiced today. However, data concerning the effects of water quality used for preparation of working liquids on the biological effects of pesticides is still scarce. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} determine insecticidal effects as depending on components used in mixes and water hardness. The effects of mixtures of thiametoxam (Actara 25 -WG 0, 07 kg/ha) with azoxystrobin (Quadris 0. 75 l/ha), mancozeb (Dithane M- 70 2. 5 kg/ha), a <b>complex</b> <b>fertilizer</b> (Mortonijc plus 3 kg/ha) and a wetting agent (Silwet L- 77), depending on the components and water hardness(slightly hard (15. 4 d°) - tap water from Novi Sad, and very hard (34. 7 d°) - well water from Adica, a Novi Sad suburb), were determined in a bioassay based on adult mortality rate of the first generation of Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say). The mixtures were applied by a flooding method. The trial was set up to include four replications. Insecticidal effects were determined 24 h and 48 h after exposure. Thiametoxam effectiveness 24 h and 48 h after application in slightly hard water was 100 % when the insecticide was applied alone and in double and triple mixes with the fungicides, <b>complex</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and wetting agent, showing no dependency on mix components. The tested adult population of Colorado potato beetle demonstrated high susmceptibility to thiametoxam, while the other components had no impact in slightly hard water.

40|$|Abstract: The Lechang Pb/Zn mine {{is located}} at the north of Guangdong Province, South of China. The {{tailings}} pond had been abandoned over five years, and revegetation was necessary for stabilizing the bare surface of the pond to reduce its environmental impact. Chemical analysis indicated the tailings contained high content of heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Cu and Cd) and low level of major nutrient elements (N, P and K) and organic matter, heavy metal toxicity and extreme infertility were the major constraints on revegetation. A field experiment was therefore conducted to compare the growth of Vertiveria zizanioides, Paspalum notatum, Cynodon dactylon and Imperata cylindraca var. major on the tailings. The tailings was amended with 10 cm domestic refuse + <b>complex</b> <b>fertilizer</b> (NPK) (Treatment A), 10 cm domestic refuse (Treatment B) and <b>complex</b> <b>fertilizer</b> (NPK) (Treatment C) respectively, and tailings without any amendment used as control (Treatment D).

For this work the following waters were used: well water from Bečej (slightly alkaline, slightly soft), well water from Adice (slightly alkaline, very hard), tap water from Novi Sad (neutral, slightly hard) and surface water from Sava and Karaš rivers (slightly alkaline, slightly hard). Surface tension of fungicide and insecticide spray liquids and their mixtures in mentioned waters was determined using tensiometer and suspensibility according to a standard method (CIPAC MT 15). The surface tension of all tested waters was high. However, the reduction of surface tension by 50 % (or more in water from Sava river) compared to the control waters, was achieved by adding the adjuvant (Sillwet L- 77) and insecticide formulated as emulsifiable concentrate (Cipkord EC- 20).

Evaluate the association between tissue Zn concentration and soil test Zn with the maize response to Zn fertilizer. Eleven experiments were carried out during the 2010, 2011 and 2012 growing seasons throughout eight states in the USA. Treatments consisted on four Zn rates of a physical blend of MAP + AS + ZnSO 4 (0, 2. 24, 4. 48, 6. 72, and 11. 2 kg/ha Zn) and MicroEssentials SZ at a Zn rate of 2. 24 kg/ha Zn. Nitrogen, phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) rates were balanced across treatments (40 kg/ha P, 22 kg/ha S) and fertilizers were broadcast and incorporated immediately prior to planting. Treatment and location main effects were significant (P< 0. 001) on corn yields, whereas the interaction treatment x location was not (P= 0. 33). Maize responded positively to Zn fertilization; average yields across locations increased from 10, 540 kg ha- 1 without Zn to 11, 530 kg ha- 1 with 11. 21 kg Zn ha- 1 applied as a physical blend.

40|$|Appropriate use of {{fertilizer}} in crop production {{to limit the}} environmental impact is essential for sustainable agriculture. While much {{is known about the}} environmental impact {{of fertilizer}} production only a limited amount of data is available covering the whole fertilizer supply chain. Up to now no comparison was done on the environmental impact of different fertilizer types (i. e., <b>complex</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> bulk blend fertilizer and single nutrient fertilizer). A cradle-to-field life cycle assessment (LCA) for the fertilizer supply chain in Germany, from extraction of raw materials, via fertilizer production, transportation and storage until final application in the field was carried out. Two different complex fertilizers were compared with single nutrient fertilizers (containing only one nutrient) and bulk blend fertilizers (containing more than one nutrient as a dry mixture). The five most relevant impact categories (i. e., climate change, acidification, eutrophication, fossil fuel depletion and resource depletion) were selected to cover different environmental impacts. Additionally, a scenario analysis was carried out focusing on nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions, as new catalytic reduction techniques for the manufacturing of nitrogen (N) containing fertilizers are available that can lead to drastic reductions of N 2 O emissions. Production of fertilizers causes high values in the impact categories climate change, fossil fuel depletion and acidification, whereas resource depletion is dominant for production and transportation. For the impact category eutrophication, the application of fertilizer is the most important factor. For a fertilizer strategy with low phosphorus application rate, a bulk blend or single nutrient fertilizer with calcium ammonium nitrate is the most sustainable choice, while for a fertilizer strategy with a balanced nutrient formula, a bulk blend or single nutrient fertilizer with calcium ammonium nitrate or a standard <b>complex</b> <b>fertilizer</b> are sustainable options. Scenario calculations with reduced N 2 O emission during the production process reveals that this reduction technique is not relevant for urea based fertilizers leading to the conclusion that products containing urea need different emission reduction techniques {{to keep up with the}} environmental improvements of other nitrogen fertilizers. With an optimized fertilization strategy the environmental burden can be reduced up to 15 %. As nitrogen application rates strongly affect the LCA results it is essential that the right amounts of N are used and that for N fertilizer production the best available technique should be installed. Furthermore, a careful consideration concerning the fertilizer product type should be part of every LCA of food and agricultural products, as this has a great impact on LCA results...|$|E

This paper {{presents}} the prospective line of studying such chemical process as granulation and {{the advantages of}} small universal vortex granulators usage in chemical processes, for example, {{for the production of}} nitrogen mineral <b>fertilizers,</b> <b>complex</b> mineral <b>fertilizers</b> and porous ammonium nitrate (PAN). The mathematical calculations for determining the hydrodynamic charac-teristics of gas flow movement, which ultimately affect the crystallization process in the workspace of the vortex granulator, are described. Components of a gas flow velocity and the granulator design impact on them are analytically determined. A comparison of theoretical and experimental studies is given...|$|R

Wet-process phosphoric acid {{was obtained from}} the Khibiny apatite concentrate (the Cola Peninsula, Russia) of composition: P 2 O 5 — 51.72, CaO— 0.67, MgO— 0.23, F— 1.33, SO 3 — 4.53, Fe 2 O 3 — 0.55, Al 2 O 3 — 0.90, SiO 2 — 0.43 % by mass by sulfuric acid attack. Phosphoric and nitric acids were mixed in a certain ratio and ammoniated in a reactor equipped with the agitator device, the reflux condenser and the water jacket, which allowed ammoniation to be carried out under near-isothermal conditions at 70  ±  2  °C.|$|R
