40|$|Abstract — Data Security is the {{practice}} of keeping data protected from corruption and unauthorized access. The focus behind Data Security is to ensure privacy while protecting personal or corporate data over the public network. Whereas, a SQL Injection or SQLi is a common programming error which generates quiet crushing results. Many successful hacking attacks start when a hacker discovers a vulnerability that gives an opportunity to inject SQL code. Paper elucidates that when a SQLi occurs, the database of the website is compromised {{and as a result}} the whole database is left at the mercy of potential hackers. Paper generates that if there is vulnerability found in the code, hackers can exploit it to gain access not only to that particular site and database but in extreme cases also to the entire Corporate Network. Impersonation could extremely destroy the personal or corporate databases. So this paper focuses on the disasters which a SQL Injection or SQLi attack can do to the Database. Moreover what preventions do the personal or corporate networks need for data security and privacy. Paper concludes with the details of <b>avoidance</b> <b>tools</b> which personnel or corporate could follow to protect database which could be compromised by the hackers through SQLi...|$|R
40|$|The Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) is the {{parachute}} system for NASA's Orion spacecraft. CPAS {{is currently in}} the Engineering Development Unit (EDU) phase of testing. The test program consists of numerous drop tests, wherein a test article rigged with parachutes is extracted from an aircraft. During such tests, range safety is paramount, as is the recoverability of {{the parachute}}s and test article. It is crucial to establish a release point from the aircraft that will ensure that the article and all items released from it during flight will land in a designated safe area. The Sasquatch footprint tool was developed to determine this safe release point and to predict the probable landing locations (footprints) of the payload and all released objects. In 2012, {{a new version of}} Sasquatch, called Sasquatch Polygons, was developed that significantly upgraded the capabilities of the footprint tool. Key improvements were an increase in the accuracy of the predictions, and the addition of an interface with the Debris Tool (DT), an in-flight debris <b>avoidance</b> <b>tool</b> for use on the test observation helicopter. Additional enhancements include improved data presentation for communication with test personnel and a streamlined code structure.

40|$|Automatic Identification System (AIS) is an {{autonomous}} and continuous communications system that exchanges maritime safety/security information between participating vessels and shore stations. In {{addition to providing}} a means for maritime administrations to effectively track the movement of vessels in coastal waters, AIS {{can also be a}} means to transmit information to ships inport or underway that contributes to safety-ofnavigation and protection of the environment. This paper discusses the development, test, and evaluation being carried out by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to examine the use of AIS Binary Messages for Enhanced Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) Operations. The AIS provides the mariner with two very import autonomous capabilities: 1) a collision <b>avoidance</b> <b>tool</b> providing other ship information and location and 2) a navigation tool providing important safety and security information. This effort focuses on the latter capability. The main approach to developing an AIS transmit capability was to perform a Requirements Study to determine the needs of the key stakeholders involved with this effort: • information providers, • VTS operators, • mariners and • shipboard system display manufacturers. The effort also includes government and industry working closely together through the Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM) to develop standards to transmit the binary messages. Finally, a test bed has been developed and implemented to provide the means to test and evaluate standards, operational requirements, and whether the system offers improvements to safety and efficiency of navigation within VTS areas...|$|R

I {{examine how}} the {{increasing}} ability of firms to target their advertise-ments to particular individuals influences market outcomes when consumers have access to advertising <b>avoidance</b> <b>tools.</b> Today firms possess an unprecedented and rapidly improving ability to discover details about individuals and reach them with advertising based on this information. For instance, as many readers know, an individual’s web browsing activities may be tracked via information stored in his browser {{as long as he}} “participates ” by not regularly deleting it, allowing ads to be customized to him upon visiting a web site. 1 Less well known may be that new technology allows Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to target ads by directly tracking which websites consumers visit, meaning that not participating is not an option for consumers. 2 Similarly, advances allow cable television operators to deliver highly customized ads to viewers. 3 For those who don’t utilize such services, it may be surprising to learn that the many millions of users of social networking tools such as Facebook and MySpace, 4 and of the popular email services of firms such as Yahoo and Google, allow ads to be served based on data generated by using the networking tools or gleaned from the contents of emails sent or received.

Owing {{to the emergence}} of global position system (GPS), some new collision avoidance and guidance systems have been developed and applied in many large-scale civil engineering projects. However, {{it is very difficult to}} find an optimal GPS-guidance transit route with safety and efficiency based on experience among complex three-dimensional working situations. Our objective is to make use of the artificial immune algorithm to optimize the GPS-guidance transit route for <b>cable</b> crane collision <b>avoidance</b> under two different working situations. A comprehensive evaluation function that merges the consideration of reliability, convenience and cost with respect to the GPS-guidance transit route has been established to assess the cable crane transit route. We used the engineering case of the Dagangshan hydropower station to test our algorithm. The results suggest that the artificial immune algorithm can effectively and stably determine the optimal route under a complex environment. The analysis of optimization performance indicates that the proposed optimization approach fully considers comprehensive performance. It reveals that the collision risk changes with the elevation of the cable crane within a three-dimensional space. These findings allow us to reasonably make use of the GPS-guidance function to achieve <b>cable</b> crane collision <b>avoidance</b> more efficiently.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Unstable {{prices have}} been a chronic problem in the U. S. hog {{industry}} during the past 15 years, and several studies illustrate the need for price risk <b>avoidance</b> <b>tools</b> for hog producers. One such price risk management tool {{is the use of}} live hog futures markets. This study explores if Pacific Northwest hog producer's could selectively utilize the live hog futures market and receive a return higher than the average cash price for barrows and gilts during the 1980 to 1986 time period. And, the study also explores whether these producers could reduce the related price uncertainty by utilizing these same selective hedging strategies. These strategies combine readily available price forecasts with localized futures market prices. A producer was assumed to hedge if the current futures market price adjusted for the appropriate basis was higher than the forecast cash price for a specific forecast time horizon. The lack of statistically different outcomes when different forecasts were utilized make it difficult to draw strong, definitive conclusions and subsequent marketing guidelines. However, {{the findings of this study}} are consistent with the findings of other studies which have shown that the combination of cash price forecasts and futures market quotations can be effective in increasing revenue while reducing price risk. This appears to be as true for hog producers in the Pacific Northwest as for producers located in the major Midwest Corn Belt. An important conclusion of this study is the fact that Pacific Northwest hog producers can utilize U. S. D. A.

Crew Resource Management (CRM) is a well-established application of Human Factors knowledge and as an error management and risk <b>avoidance</b> <b>tool</b> has given the industry opportunity to examine operational behaviours and the relationship of less favourable behaviours to accident causality. The identified behaviours can provide a guide for further training and development of standard operating procedures. The industry requires valid and reliable methodology to measure behaviours that evaluate behaviour using behavioural marking scales known as Behavioural Markers. The data collation possible with these measures can provide auditable data for safety measurement and training needs. This paper reports the results of a survey, conducted in 2002, of a sample of CRM practitioners in the Australian Airline industry. The survey sought their personal opinions on the proposed regulatory changes; their knowledge, skills and attitude to both CRM and Behavioural measures; and comment on the regulators’ role and suggestions for implementation. The results provide a snap shot of practitioner perceived skills and knowledge in evaluating CRM training and perceived organisational characteristics that resist change. Results indicate that measurement of CRM behaviours as a guide to safety is a well accepted concept and that although practitioners feel comfortable with their knowledge of Behavioural Markers they do not have the same confidence in the depth of knowledge in their respective organisations. The practitioners feel that organisational knowledge; culture and training cultures will hinder implementation. The practitioners also indicate less confidence in their skills for behavioural measures and assessor qualifications.

40|$|A {{major concern}} for the {{navigator}} during a voyage is collision avoidance. The IBS (Integrated Bridge System) has a large quantity of marine traffic data available. Complicated and congested traffic may challenge the navigational safety. It is of vital importance that the navigator is equipped with the necessary tools {{to be able to}} do a fast assessment of the situation. Visual observation, ARPA and AIS are the main information sources today. The introduction of a collision avoidance display that focus on real-time presentation of danger areas in true motion enables the navigator to judge collision risk for any acquired target and simultaneously identify suitable evasive manoeuvres. The simulator study focused on evaluating two collision avoidance displays, CDP (Collision Danger Presentation) and RTM (Room To Manoeuvre) versus standard ARPA. In addition CDP versus RTM was evaluated. The subjects consisted of experienced navigators from the Royal Norwegian Navy and final year marine cadets from the Royal Norwegian Naval Academy. The study was conducted on a full mission bridge simulator by three trial scenarios with increasing difficulty level. The evaluation was based on descriptive methods and parametric tests. A reflection on making decisions in collision avoidance is given in the thesis. The excellence of both collision avoidance displays was proven, where the major benefit was reduction in reaction time. Between the populations it was found that the cadets benefitted from the collision avoidance displays in both the simple and the congested scenario, whilst the experienced navigators mainly improved their performance in the congested scenario. The evaluation of CDP versus RTM indicated that the CDP display was preferred. As for the collision <b>avoidance</b> <b>tools</b> existing today, the CDP does not take into account the COLREGs. This aspect is, and will in the nearest future, be the navigator’s task to incorporate in his choice of evasive manoeuvres.

A boundary curve of the machined surface is subdivided into curve segments. Each segment works as a guide curve in the design method for developable Bézier surface that controls a developable patch for approximating the surface with available degrees of freedom. Geometric algorithms are proposed for calculating consecutive patches with G 1 continuity across the patch boundary. A tapered tool can move along the rulings of these patches without inducing local tool interference {{as a result of}} their developability. The machining deviation is controlled by the surface approximation error. A machining test is conducted with the generated CL data and the result verifies the feasibility of the proposed approach.

This research used actigraphy, self-reported sleep, and survey and questionnaire data to {{determine the amount of}} sleep that participants received and to assess whether differences existed between various groups, departments, and watch rotations. The Sleep, Activity, Fatigue, and Task Effectiveness Model-Fatigue <b>Avoidance</b> Scheduling <b>Tool</b> was used to predict the on-watch effectiveness of the participants.

Given the nature of responsibilities placed on U. S. Navy watchstanders, working under conditions of avoidable sleep deprivation is unacceptable. Using information gained from a predictive performance model instantiated in the Fatigue <b>Avoidance</b> Scheduling <b>Tool</b> (FAST), the optimal watch alternative plan to use is a 3 / 9 -watch rotation, where personnel stand three hours of watch followed by nine hours off. This thesis attempted to quantify the effects of sleep deprivation on performance and to determine how that performance is changed through the use of the 3 / 9 -watch rotation compared to a traditional four section 5 / 15 -watch. Results comparing performance to sleep showed performance did increase with higher sleep levels and indicated better performance for personnel standing watch at certain times of the day.

A simulated 21 -member Armidale Class Patrol Boat (ACPB) crew was constructed in the NMD to assess the NSWW. The NMD fatigue measurement tool and the Sleep, Activity, Fatigue and Task Effectiveness (SAFTE) model, and its software instantiation, the Fatigue <b>Avoidance</b> Scheduling <b>Tool</b> (FAST), were used to estimate risk for the periods of activity across the three weeks, resulting in comparison of the associated risk levels identified by the NMD fatigue tool and corresponding FAST scores. In the proposed RAN NSWW model, the category of maintenance most often exceeded its allocated hours, leading to the recommendation that further research on a larger sample might address whether the proposed NSWW should be customized to be platform and occupation specific. The NMD and FAST software tool comparisons resulted in statistically significant differences in predicted risk. The discussion speculates on why these discrepancies exist between the two software tools.

Supervisors must often extend employees' work hours considerably in order to meet mission (i. e., test) timelines. Supervisors at the BAF currently have no accurate means of identifying when an employee's work performance is at risk of decreasing due to sleep deprivation, unbalanced circadian rhythms, and/or fatigue. Therefore, the focus of this research was to create a method for supervisors to effectively gauge the work performance levels of employees placed at risk for sleep deprivation. Thus, individual sleep data were collected for one week on eight volunteers at the BAF using assigned sleep monitoring devices known as Actigraphs. Extensive questionnaires were developed to determine volunteers' sleep pattern, demographics, and sleep history. For analysis purposes, the Fast <b>Avoidance</b> Scheduling <b>Tool</b> (FAST), based on the Sleep, Activity, Fatigue, and Task Effectiveness (SAFTE) model was used to determine how the performance level of each volunteer differed based on the amount of sleep acquired.

30|$|Travel activity, even {{a simple}} one, {{consists}} {{a long list}} of travel subtasks. There are two main categories of the subtasks in travel activity that are mobility and environmental access [5]. Mobility itself can be divided in obstacle avoidance and orientation/navigation, while environment access consists of hazard minimization and information/sign. Most of subtasks in travel activity are based on the vision information. For this, sighted people mainly rely on their sense of sight. Visually impaired are only able to use their sense of sight to a limited extent or possibly not at all. Therefore, visually impaired people require support from assistive technology to carry out different travel activity subtasks. In our work, we focus on developing assistive technology for obstacle avoidance for visually impaired people, because it has always been considered a primary requirement for aided mobility. Obstacle avoidance technology needs to address two issues: obstacle detection and obstacle warning. The obstacle detection means the perception of potentially hazardous objects in the environment ahead of time, while the latter one concerns the manner to convey obstacle information to the visually impaired people. White cane can be considered as the first obstacle <b>avoidance</b> assistive <b>tool.</b> However, this tool is generally not used to detect obstacles above knee height.

This thesis seeks {{to determine the extent to}} which fatigue plays a part in human factors related to large truck mishaps. This study is conducted using the Large Truck Crash Causation Study data base and assesses drivers' predicted level of effectiveness employing the Sleep, Activity, Fatigue, and Task Effectiveness Model as instantiated in the Fatigue <b>Avoidance</b> Scheduling <b>Tool</b> (FAST). The entire population of truck crashes is categorized into two groups, those with human factors causes and those with non-human factors causes. A comparison of the two groups shows a statistically significant difference between the two groups in reported sleep and predicted levels of effectiveness. This result shows that fatigue is more prevalent and is potentially an important contributing factor to human factors related mishaps. Heightened levels of fatigue diminish situational awareness, judgment, and decision-making capabilities and can result in serious, sometimes even deadly consequences. It is recommended that fatigue avoidance strategies such as FAST be implemented in training and operational planning. Such strategies can assist in the development of more efficient and potentially safer sleep-work schedules. US Marine Corps (USMC) author...|$|R
40|$|Radar offers {{advantages}} as {{a robotic}} perception modality {{because it is}} not as vulnerable to the vacuum, dust, fog, rain, snow and light conditions found in construction, mining, agricultural and planetary-exploration environments. However radar has shortcomings such as a large footprint, sidelobes, specularity effects and limited range resolution [...] -all of which result in poor environment maps. The fusion of successive radar observations can alleviate radar shortcomings and improve map fidelity. Sensor models exist for the fusion of sonar, laser and stereo into evidence grids. However radar outputs richer data and cannot use those existing models. This paper presents a sensor model that uses constant false alarm for occupancy detection and incorporates heuristic rules to approach occlusions. The resulting radar-based map of outdoors can suit robot obstacle <b>avoidance,</b> navigation and <b>tool</b> deployment. The limited map detail achieved suggests the need for a more rigorous probabilistic approach to encode the dependencies and estimate the model parameters. Keywords: Millimeter-wave radar, evidence grids, robot sensing, mobile robots, FMCW radar. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} non-linear forced oscillations of sagged inclined cables under planar 1 : 1 internal resonance at avoidance. To {{account for}} frequency avoidance phenomena and associated hybrid modes actually distinguishing inclined cables from horizontal cables, asymmetric inclined static configurations are considered. Emphasis {{is placed on}} highlighting nearly tuned 1 : 1 resonant interactions involving coupled hybrid modes. The inclined cable is subjected to a uniformly distributed vertical harmonic excitation at primary resonance of a high-frequency mode. Approximate non-linear partial-differential equations of motion, capturing overall displacement coupling and dynamic extensibility effect, are analytically solved based on a multi-mode discretization and a second-order multiple scales approach. Bifurcation analyses of both equilibrium and dynamic solutions are carried out via a continuation technique, highlighting the influence of system parameters on internally resonant forced dynamics of <b>avoidance</b> <b>cables.</b> Direct numerical integrations of modulation equations are also performed to validate the continuation prediction and characterize non-linear coupled dynamics in post-bifurcation states. Depending on the elasto-geometric (cable sag and inclination) and control parameters, and on assigned initial conditions, the hybrid modal interactions undergo several kinds of bifurcations and non-linear phenomena, along with meaningful transition from periodic to quasi-periodic and chaotic responses. Moreover, corresponding spatio-temporal distributions of cable non-linear dynamic displacement and tension are manifested...|$|R
