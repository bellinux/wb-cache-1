5|$|Oslac's origins {{are unclear}} and no {{specific}} relationship with any previous known figure {{can be established}} from available sources. Oslac's name suggests to some historians {{that he was a}} Norseman. Dorothy Whitelock points out that the name Oslac is often an anglicisation of the Old Scandinavian name Áslákr, while the writers of the Biographical Dictionary of Dark Age Britain entry on Oslac <b>comment</b> <b>that</b> the name suggests an origin in the Danelaw, a suggestion supported by the fact that Thored, Oslac's son, held lands in Cambridgeshire.|$|E
5|$|Paulet was {{something}} of an eccentric. On one occasion, while his ship was moored at Spithead, he asked his admiral for permission to take leave to visit London. This was refused, with the <b>comment</b> <b>that</b> Paulet could travel as far on land as he could get in his barge. Thus challenged, Paulet loaded his barge onto a cart {{and went off to}} London anyway.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus {{is silent}} about archers on the Alamanni side. The Germans almost {{certainly}} did not have mounted archers, as this was an arm that evolved in the East and in any case, their longbows are unsuitable for use on horseback. As for the infantry, the archery capability of the Rhine Germans has traditionally been seen as negligible, due to the 6th-century writer Agathias's <b>comment</b> <b>that</b> the Franks {{did not know how}} to use bows. But this is contradicted by the archaeological record and by Ammianus himself in other parts of his account. It is virtually certain that there were a significant number of Alamanni foot archers at Strasbourg.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Schumacher later <b>commented</b> <b>that</b> {{he thought}} it was [...] "overly harsh" [...] on Montoya for the incident, while Montoya himself <b>commented</b> <b>that</b> it was [...] "very unfair" [...] and that he [...] "gave Michael room" [...] and <b>commented</b> <b>that</b> Schumacher [...] "understeered and touched him" [...] before adding that [...] "it was a racing incident".|$|R

25|$|Both Archibald Wavell in the 1930s and Sir John Dill as CIGS in 1941 (who <b>commented</b> <b>that</b> he {{no longer}} {{condemned}} Wilson ”so heartily as one used to”) <b>commented</b> <b>that</b> Wilson had illustrated that a general {{must be able to}} work effectively with politicians, and his modern biographer Keith Jeffery <b>comments</b> <b>that</b> this, rather than Robertson’s acrimonious insistence on military autonomy, has been the model since Wilson’s time.|$|R
5|$|Growing up {{as part of}} a lucha libre {{family the}} future Espanto Jr. decided he wanted to follow in the {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather at an early age. In a 2010 interview he recalled how he would be in the front row watching his father wrestle from the time he could walk. In 1996 his father suffered an injury during a match and was briefly clinically dead while in the ring until he was revived. While the injury left a big impression on the then-10 year old he later accepted that it was an accident and tried not to think about it, but did <b>comment</b> <b>that</b> his mother still worried about him every time he competed.|$|E
5|$|His knighthood {{involved}} some controversy, {{following his}} wife's public <b>comment</b> <b>that</b> {{he was the}} only Australian state governor without such an honour. As knighthoods were then conferred by the Queen on the recommendation of her Federal and State governments, and the Governor was the Queen's representative in the state, this was seen as highly inappropriate, especially given the Western Australian ALP State government of the day, led by John Tonkin had a policy of not recommending Imperial Honours. However, the Tonkin Government was defeated in April 1974 and the incoming Liberal Premier, Sir Charles Court, was happy to make the necessary recommendation.|$|E
5|$|In early 1936, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara (1913–1994), a 22-year-old blonde-haired, blue-eyed dancer of Irish descent. She had {{run away}} from home, intent on making a career in dance, and aged 18 joined the chorus line at the London Palladium. Introduced by Augustus John, Caitlin's lover, they met in The Wheatsheaf pub on Rathbone Place in London's West End. Laying his head in her lap, a drunken Thomas proposed. Thomas liked to <b>comment</b> <b>that</b> he and Caitlin were in bed {{together}} ten minutes after they first met. Although Caitlin initially continued her relationship with John, she and Thomas began a correspondence, {{and in the second}} half of 1936 were courting. They married at the register office in Penzance, Cornwall, on 11 July 1937. In early 1938 they moved to Wales, renting a cottage in the village of Laugharne, Carmarthenshire. Their first child, Llewelyn Edouard, was born on 30 January 1939.|$|E
5000|$|GameSpot's Cameron Davis {{called it}} a [...] "stopgap" [...] to appease players until the release of Gold and Silver, <b>commenting</b> <b>that</b> [...] "the new {{challenges}} are enough to fill the hole - but only just". GameDaily's Chris Buffa listed {{it as one of}} the best Pokémon games, <b>commenting</b> <b>that</b> while it was a rehash, there was enough that was new to warrant playing. Allgame's Brad Cook <b>commented</b> <b>that</b> for those who didn't play Red and Blue, Yellow was good; but otherwise, he advised that they wait until Gold and Silver. The Daily Telegraphs Steve Boxer <b>commented</b> <b>that</b> while it had good gameplay mechanics, it was held back by the lack of features. He described Nintendo's actions as avaricious, <b>commenting</b> <b>that</b> Yellow [...] "marks the point where Pokémon ceases to become a game and becomes a marketing exercise/obsession-satisfier".|$|R
5000|$|Lawrence Schick <b>comments</b> <b>that</b> [...] "The introductory-level {{rules are}} so loose, the game barely qualifies as an RPG." [...] He <b>commented</b> <b>that</b> the hand puppets [...] "have {{no bearing on}} play, but are nice to have".|$|R

5|$|In the 1970s and 1980s Utopia became {{well known}} for the design and {{production}} of batiks. By 1981 there were 50artists at Utopia creating batik works; 88 artists participated in a major design project supported by the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association. Although several sources <b>comment</b> <b>that</b> artistic activity at Utopia began with batik and only later moved to painting, they do not state whether or not Minnie was a textile artist before she took up the brush. The National Gallery of Victoria's brief biography suggests {{that she did not}} participate in the making of batik, but she was aware of it.|$|E
5|$|On January 3, 2013 {{the band}} {{announced}} their upcoming tour in Europe {{would be their}} last, leading to rumors that the band would be breaking up. This was later confirmed by a post on the band's Facebook page {{that they would be}} finished {{at the end of the}} year. The band also stated that they would like to set up an Australian tour during the summer and singer Brandan Schieppati stated in a reply to an Instagram <b>comment</b> <b>that</b> the band would have a final U.S. tour possibly starting in September. November 2013 the band announced final west coast dates will take place in 2014.|$|E
5|$|By then, {{there was}} already a {{movement}} within the Army General Staff to have Matsui removed from his post. Reports of the atrocities in Nanking had reached the Japanese government and some within the Army General Staff blamed Matsui for mishandling the crisis and causing Japan international embarrassment. Some even wanted him court-martialed for negligence. Even so, the Japanese government was not planning on dismissing Matsui solely because of the Nanking Massacre. The Foreign Ministry was displeased by anti-Western statements Matsui had made after becoming CCAA commander, including his <b>comment</b> <b>that</b> he did not recognize the neutrality of foreign concessions in Shanghai, and the Army General Staff was concerned about Matsui's severe personality conflicts with his subordinate commanders, which were interfering with the chain of command. The Army Minister Hajime Sugiyama told General Shunroku Hata that the inability of Matsui and his subordinates to coordinate and cooperate with one another was the reason he was being removed.|$|E

5|$|The Han-era Chinese {{discussed}} the illumination and shapes of heavenly bodies: were they flat and circular, {{or were they}} rounded and spherical? Jing Fang wrote in the 1st century BCE that Han astronomers believed the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical like balls or crossbow bullets. He also wrote that the Moon and planets produce no light of their own, are viewable to people on Earth only because they are illuminated by the Sun, and those parts not illuminated by the Sun would be dark on the other side. For this, Jing compared the Moon to a mirror illuminating light. In the 2nd century CE, Zhang Heng drew a similar comparison to Jing's by stating that the Sun is like fire and the Moon and planets are like water, since fire produces light and water reflects it. He also repeated Jing's <b>comment</b> <b>that</b> {{the side of the}} moon not illuminated by the Sun was left in darkness. However, Zhang noted that sunlight did not always reach the Moon since the Earth obstructs the rays during a lunar eclipse. He also noted that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon and Sun crossed paths to block sunlight from reaching earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} was {{refined and}} expanded from the version they used in Awakening. The My Castle feature was suggested by Maeda {{as an alternative}} activity for players, {{and to provide a}} means for getting to know the main characters outside battle. The amount of content included in the feature made some staff <b>comment</b> <b>that</b> it could be its own game. The social elements of My Castle were originally going to be exclusive to StreetPass, but it was suggested that players in areas with low StreetPass activity should be able to access the functions through a normal Internet connection. Some ideas thought up by Maeda for earlier titles, such as the Dragon Vein ability and the way skills were inherited by second generation characters, were also implemented. Due to the necessity for multiple versions, map designing became a larger task than anticipated, with very few maps being shared between versions. The Phoenix Mode was included to bring new fans into the series, a philosophy that they had neglected up until Awakening and improved for Fates. For {{the first time in the}} Fire Emblem series, the option for the main character to marry a character of the same sex was included: the potential male and female partners respectively appear in Conquest and Birthright, and both appear in Revelation. According to Nintendo, this move was done to reflect the diversity of their player base.|$|E

50|$|Anoop Gantayat, {{writer for}} IGN.com, <b>commented</b> <b>that</b> both titles, {{especially}} Bird & Beans, felt like Game & Watch titles, both lacking in frills. He also <b>commented</b> <b>that</b> {{they were great}} {{to play for a}} few minutes, and that he liked how quickly the game would load up, not having to wait for the game to go through various company logos. He <b>commented</b> <b>that</b> he would have preferred if the games weren't one-hit-kill games, saying that it hampers their replay values.|$|R
