5|$|The Party for Freedom's {{political}} platform often overlaps {{those of the}} assassinated Rotterdam politician Pim Fortuyn and his Pim Fortuyn List. After his death, Fortuyn's impact remained, {{as more and more}} politicians sought to gain political mileage by directly confronting topics such as a ban on immigration that were, from a politically correct point of view, considered unmentionable in the Netherlands until Fortuyn <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> and upended the Dutch tradition of consensus politics with an anti-immigration stance. Wilders would position himself to inherit Fortuyn's constituency. The Party for Freedom called for a €16billion tax reduction, a far stricter policy toward recreational drug use, investing more in roads and other infrastructure, building nuclear power plants and including animal rights in the Dutch constitution. In the 2006 Dutch parliamentary election, their first parliamentary election, the Party for Freedom won 9 out of the 150 open seats.|$|E
25|$|While with Crocodile, Bettesworth was {{involved}} in an unsuccessful claim for salvage rights to the American vessel Walker. A French privateer had captured Walker, but her crew had subsequently recaptured their ship when Crocodile <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> Crocodile then escorted Walker to Halifax. For this service, Bettesworth claimed salvage rights. The court did not agree.|$|E
25|$|James Knowles III, the Mayor of Ferguson, {{was slow}} to seek support and {{coordination}} from state and county authorities as violence and civil unrest developed in his municipality. Mayor Knowles did not receive {{a phone call from}} either the Governor or others as riots developed and even as others <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> no one appeared to take charge.|$|E

25|$|The Italians now <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> Asseb, a port {{near the}} {{southern}} {{entrance of the}} Red Sea, had been bought from the local sultan in March 1870 by an Italian company, which, after acquiring more land in 1879 and 1880, was bought out by the Italian government in 1882. In this year Count Pietro Antonelli was dispatched to Shewa {{in order to improve}} the prospects of the colony by treaties with Sahle Maryam of Shewa and the sultan of Aussa.|$|E
25|$|Rhône-Poulenc {{licensed}} chlorpromazine to Smith Kline & French (today's GlaxoSmithKline) in 1953. In 1955 it {{was approved}} in the United States {{for the treatment}} of emesis (vomiting). The effect of this drug in emptying psychiatric hospitals has been compared to that of penicillin and infectious diseases. But the popularity of the drug fell from the late 1960s as newer drugs <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> From chlorpromazine a number of other similar antipsychotics were developed. It also led to the discovery of antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|Another new England coach <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> in Glenn Hoddle and Ince {{kept his}} {{place for the}} next six internationals, which {{included}} five crucial qualifiers for the 1998 World Cup in France. England won four of them but lost 1–0 at home to Italy. During the first of these qualifiers against Moldova in Chişinău, a famous photograph of Ince was taken as he tried to climb a wall at the stadium, only for Gascoigne to pull his tracksuit trousers down, revealing Ince's bare buttocks in front of an army of cameras.|$|E

After a solo and a dance for Tiresias and male corps de ballet, priestesses and a young virgin <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> <b>The</b> Neophyte gives him a wand and departs. Tiresias spots two snakes copulating and in a rage he strikes the female snake with his staff and is thus changed into a woman.|$|R
25|$|On 3 January 1807 Scorpion, {{still under}} the command of Carteret, was chasing a cutter some 15 miles south of The Lizard. Pickle <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> made all sail, and succeeded in {{catching}} up with the quarry, with whom she exchanged two broadsides. Lieutenant Daniel Callaway of Pickle ran alongside the French vessel and his crew boarded and captured her. The French vessel was the privateer Favorite, of 14 guns and 70 men {{under the command of}} M. E. J. Boutruche. She was only two months old and had left Cherbourg two days before.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{eminence}} and influence, one criticism {{leveled against}} Yashovijaya {{is that he}} {{is best known for his}} Navya-Nyaya commentaries of earlier existing works rather than his own original works. Furthermore, his works on Yoga, dhyana, grammar and poetry did not gain much fame, as the works of Haribhadra and Hemacandra on these topics were already established and famous by the time Yashovijaya <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> His fame largely rests on his mastery of navyanyaya, for which he had no contemporary rival. This could be because, for almost six centuries between Hemacandra and Yashovijaya, Jainism did not produce any able scholar on philosophy of nyaya.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, Drs. Walter H. Schottky and Erwin Gerlach co-invented the first ribbon microphone. By turning the ribbon circuit in the {{opposite}} direction, they also invented the first ribbon loudspeaker. A few years later, Dr. Harry F. Olson of RCA started developing ribbon microphones using ﬁeld coils and permanent magnets. The RCA Photophone Type PB-31 was commercially manufactured in 1931, greatly impacting the audio recording and broadcasting industries. Condenser microphones at the time could not compare to its frequency response. Radio City Music Hall employed PB-31s in 1932. The following year, the 44A <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> Its tone and pattern control helped reduce reverberation. Many RCA ribbon models are still in use and valued by engineers.|$|E

25|$|Playing in a {{match at}} College Park (Trinity College) in Dublin for Dublin University against a London County XI in 1903 Harvey caught and bowled (for a duck!) W.G.Grace. Another future Bishop, Jack Crozier, {{performed}} a cartwheel as Grace walked reluctantly to the pavilion. Grace allegedly {{complained to the}} umpire that the crowd {{had come to see}} him bat and not to watch Harvey bowl. With the previous ball, Harvey had dismissed W.L. Murdoch, one time captain of Australia. Interestingly Harvey faced the three fastest bowlers in the world playing for Dublin University against Australia, Leicestershire & South Africa; they were Cotter, Kortright and Cootzee. He held that Cotter was a bodyline bowler long before Larwood <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|E
25|$|As part of Charles Lee's Advance Guard, Grayson's Detachment led the American {{column of}} march {{on the morning}} of the battle. After a skirmish, Philemon Dickinson's New Jersey militia was driven back by the Queen's Rangers. When Grayson's Detachment <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> the Queen's Rangers retreated eastward. Dickinson advised Grayson not to advance any farther because it would a put narrow bridge behind his troops with British troops {{hovering}} nearby. However, Lee created an ad hoc command made up of Grayson's Detachment, Butler's detachment, Henry Jackson's detachment, and Eleazer Oswald's four cannons and sent the troops forward under Wayne. Seeing British troops around 9:30 AM, Wayne ordered Butler and Jackson to engage them while keeping back Grayson's men to guard a key road intersection. Wayne's men skirmished with their adversaries.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, on 3 March, Severn {{destroyed}} the American privateer Ino. American accounts report that Ino grounded outside of Charleston on 7 March. As hr crew {{was attempting to}} free Ino, Severn <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> and launched her boats to board Ino. Inos crew, unaware that the war had ended on 15 February 1815, fired grapeshot and small arms at the British boats, causing them to shear off. Ino crew then set fire to her and took to their boats and some improvised rafts. A schooner that came out from Charleston rescued almost all. The Inos crew believed that Captain Nourse of Severn had known for some days that the war had ended. The delay of payment of the head money {{may have been due}} to the need to adjudicate the case.|$|E

40|$|Institutional {{review boards}} (IRBs) have evolved {{since the middle}} of the 1960 s as {{independent}} reviewers of research protocols that, if approved, will be funded by the U. S. government or will test drugs or devices regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. As their name suggests, IRBs began and developed at academic research institutions. More recently, independent, so-called “central ” IRBs have <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> <b>The</b> following two articles recap the history of IRBs and examine {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} local, institution-affiliated IRBs and central, non-affiliated IRBs...|$|R

25|$|Next day, two brigs, {{which turned}} out to be the Excise vessel Royal George and Sappho, were chasing a French lugger when Ariadne and Ringdove <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> Royal George, J.T. Currie (or Curry), Commander, then {{captured}} the French lugger, which was the privateer Eglee (or Eglé), under the command of M. Olivier. She was armed with 16 guns, all 3 or 4-pounders, and had left Dunkirk on 31 December. She had made one capture, the brig Gabriel, of Yarmouth, which she had taken the night before and scuttled. Captain A. Farquhar of Ariadne saw Gabriel still floating and dispatched Ringdove to investigate. Andrews reported that the brig was sinking so fast that it was impossible to save her. However, Gabriel's Master and crew were aboard Eglé. Farquhar then sent Trente et Quarante and Eglé into Yarmouth.|$|E
25|$|Pacthod's force {{departed}} from Vatry at dawn, having marched {{most of the}} night with the convoy. By 10:00 am Pacthod was in Villeseneux where he decided to rest his weary soldiers. At this time, the force came under attack from 1,200 dragoons and horse chasseurs supported by 12 guns under Fyodor Karlovich Korf. Pacthod anchored his right flank on Villeseneux while Amey's entire division in square formed his left flank and 16 French guns covered the front. Korff's cavalry corps belonged to Langeron's army corps. For 90 minutes, the French moved southwest deployed in six masses while easily fending off Korf's horsemen. At Clamanges Pacthod made the decision to abandon the convoy, taking the teams of horses to help haul his artillery pieces. More Russian cavalry arrived until Korf's force comprised 2,000 line cavalry and 1,000 Cossacks. Two horse chasseur regiments circled around to the west, blocking the French retreat toward Fère-Champenoise. One of Pacthod's brigades under Marie Joseph Raymond Delort formed attack columns and drove off the chasseurs. Between 2:00 and 3:00 pm the French reached Écury-le-Repos when more Allied cavalry <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|E
25|$|Enthused by {{the speech}} of Jathedar Tehal Singh, the entire Shaheedi Jatha {{followed}} him. By this time, another horseman messenger, Bhai Ram Singh, arrived. In vain did he too try to persuade Jathedar Tehal Singh and the Jatha to return. The Jatha soon entered Darshni Deohri of the Gurdwara and shut the main door from inside. While some of the devotees took their seats inside the Prakash Asthan, others sat on the platform and the Baran dari. Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali sat on Guru's tabia. Mahant Narayan Das came to know of the situation through the Jaikaras (victory slogans) of the Shaheedi Jatha. At first, he was utterly shocked thinking that {{the game was over}} but he soon recovered and ordered his mercenaries to kill everyone in the Jatha. They fired bullets at the Sangat in Gurdwara hall. Several bullets pierced through Sri Guru Granth Sahib. The hired gundas wielded swords, spears, hatchets and other lethal weapons to mercilessly slaughter the peaceful and unprovocative Sikhs within the very premises of the Gurdwara. The dead and dying Singhs were then dragged to a pile of logs which had been collected earlier and consigned to flame. By the time the police and local Sikhs <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> all the dead men had been consumed by the fire. Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali who was wounded with a gunshot was tied to a Jand tree and burnt alive. It was a butchery at its worst form.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, Say Zuzu {{released}} {{their most}} critically acclaimed album, Bull. The release of Bull signaled a more mature Say Zuzu than the band that had <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> in 1995, and earned them several nods from record companies {{as well as}} more commercial success in the US. The next year, the band released a live album entitled Live.|$|R

500|$|Although buyout firms {{generally}} {{had different}} aims and methods, {{they were often}} lumped in with the [...] "corporate raiders" [...] who <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> in the 1980s. The raiders were best known for hostile bids—takeover attempts that were opposed by management. By contrast, private equity firms generally attempted to strike deals with boards and CEOs, though in many cases in the 1980s they allied with managements that were already under pressure from raiders. But both groups bought companies through leveraged buyouts; both relied heavily on junk bond financing; and under both types of owners in many cases major assets were sold, costs were slashed and employees were laid off. Hence, in the public mind, they were lumped together.|$|E
500|$|Confessions falls {{mainly in}} the R genre. Usher commented that he chose to work with {{collaborators}} who know [...] "...how to interpret R from a jazz standpoint, an old school throwback standpoint, a new school point, a traditional classic standpoint..." [...] With producers and Usher set to produce such an album, however, other musical genres including hip hop were incorporated. While {{he wanted to do}} R, Usher also wanted his fans to experience hip hop at the same time: [...] "I try to think outside the box." [...] When Lil Jon <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> crunk was introduced to the R album, specifically on the Sean Garrett-penned song [...] "Yeah!". Usher said, [...] "'Yeah!' could be called the first consciously styled [...] "crunk R" [...] record." [...] The album also includes various slow jams.|$|E
