40|$|Abstract: This paper {{raises some}} of the ethical issues that have become {{relevant}} as academia has increasingly relied upon {{a greater proportion of}} industry sponsorship for research. First, we must acknowledge, discuss and de-clare the appearance of conflict of interest, taking care not to fuel a public perception of bias. Researchers must be guaranteed academic freedom and professional auton-omy, and contracts with undue <b>confidentiality</b> <b>clauses</b> should be avoided. Scrutiny by Research Ethics Boards (REBs) and standardization of policies in university depart-ments and scientific journals help guide and regulate this potentially dangerous interface.

40|$|The law {{relating}} to trade secrets and to enforcement of non-compete and <b>confidentiality</b> <b>clauses</b> in the post-termination phase {{impacts on the}} ability of employees to find new employment and to use knowledge accumulated in previous employment when they do. This article compares the approaches in select common law and civil law jurisdictions to these areas of law. The law is complex, not harmonized and often unpredictable, and a number of significant policy goals come into conflict. The article concludes that while calls for restricting non-competes have merit, they should be assessed {{in the context of the}} contiguous laws concerning other contractual clauses and trade secrets...|$|R
40|$|The {{notion of}} ‘decentred regulation’ {{from the field}} of {{regulatory}} theory is adopted in order to explore the idea that individual contractual clauses have the capacity to regulate the behaviour of both employers and employees. The focus here is on restraint of trade and <b>confidentiality</b> <b>clauses.</b> These make ideal exemplars because (a) one operates, to a large extent, during the course of employment while the other takes effect post employment and (b) because they are peripheral to the main clauses in a contract of employment. Using the concepts of norms and normative practices, and locating their use within the psychological contract, the article argues that individual clauses can regulate the behaviour of employers and employees as long as the existence of the obligations are emphasised and the normative basis for the clauses is communicated effectively...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Financial {{conflicts}} of interest (fCOI) can introduce actions that bias clinical trial results and reduce their objectivity. We obtained information from investigators about adherence to practices that minimize the introduction of such bias in their clinical trials experience. Methods Email survey of clinical trial investigators from Canadian sites to learn about adherence to practices that help maintain research independence across all stages of trial preparation, conduct, and dissemination. The main outcome was the proportion of investigators that reported full adherence to preferred trial practices for all of their trials conducted from 2001 - 2006, stratified by funding source. Results 844 investigators responded (76 %) and 732 (66 %) provided useful information. Full adherence to preferred clinical trial practices was highest for institutional review of signed contracts and budgets (82 % and 75 % of investigators respectively). Lower rates of full adherence were reported for the other two practices in the trial preparation stage (avoidance of <b>confidentiality</b> <b>clauses,</b> 12 %; trial registration after 2005, 39 %). Lower rates of full adherence were reported for 7 practices in the trial conduct (35 % to 43 %) and dissemination (53 % to 64 %) stages, particularly in industry funded trials. 269 investigators personally experienced (n = 85) or witnessed (n = 236) a fCOI; over 70 % of these situations related to industry trials. Conclusion Full adherence to practices designed to promote the objectivity of research varied across trial stages and was low overall, particularly for industry funded trials. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objectives To {{investigate}} {{the practice of}} post-marketing studies in Germany during a three year period and to evaluate whether these trials meet the aims specified in the German Medicinal Products Act. Design Survey of notifications submitted to German regulatory agencies before post-marketing studies were carried out, 2008 - 10. Setting Notifications obtained through freedom of information requests to the three authorities responsible for registering post-marketing studies in Germany. Main outcome measures Descriptive statistics of post-marketing studies, including the products under study, intended number of patients, intended number of participating physicians, proposed remunerations, study plan and protocol, and availability of associated scientific publications and reports on adverse drug reactions. Results Information was obtained from 558 studies, with a median of 600 (mean 2331, range 2 - 75 [*] 000) patients and 63 (270, 0 - 7000) participating physicians per study. The median remuneration to physicians per patient was € 200 (€ 441, € 0 -€ 7280) (£ 170, £ 0 -£ 6200; $ 215, $ 0 -$ 7820), with a total remuneration cost of more than € 217 m for 558 studies registered over the three year period. The median remuneration per participating physician per study was € 2000 (mean € 19 [*] 424), ranging from € 0 to € 2 [*] 080 [*] 000. There was {{a broad range of}} drugs and non-drug products, of which only a third represented recently approved drugs. In many notifications, data, information, and results were, by contract, strictly confidential and the sole property of the respective sponsor. No single adverse drug reaction report could be identified from any of the 558 post-marketing studies. Less than 1 % of studies could be verified as published in scientific journals. Conclusions Post-marketing studies are not improving drug safety surveillance. Sample sizes are generally too small to allow the detection of rare adverse drug reactions, and many participating physicians are strictly obliged to maintain confidentiality towards the sponsor. High remuneration and strict <b>confidentiality</b> <b>clauses</b> in these studies could influence the physicians’ reporting behaviours of adverse drug reactions. BMJ 2017; 356 :j 33...|$|R
