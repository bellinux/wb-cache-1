50|$|The {{severity}} of this epic storm remained in dispute {{for a long}} period within the meteorological <b>community.</b> <b>Official</b> observations classified this tornado as F4, but damage was consistent with an F5 tornado in five of the affected towns (Rutland, Holden, Worcester, Shrewsbury and Westborough). As a result of this debate, the National Weather Service took an unprecedented step and convened a panel of weather experts during the spring of 2005 to study the latest evidence on the wind strength of the Worcester tornado. The panel considered whether to raise its designation to F5, but decided during the summer of 2005 to keep the official rating as a strong F4. The reasoning for this was that the anchoring techniques used in many of the destroyed or vanished homes could never now be ascertained with certainty, and some of these structures (many of recent postwar construction) were possibly more vulnerable to high winds than older homes. Without a proper engineering qualification, it would be nearly impossible to determine with 100% accuracy which damage was F5 and which was F4, as appearances would be similar.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{automatic}} mechanism for bilingual (Spanish-English) alignment of anaphoric expressions. For this purpose, two anaphora resolution systems were used. Both {{are based on}} linguistic preferences and constraints, for Spanish (SUPPAR) and for English (MARS). These systems have been independently developed {{and each of them}} is presented individually with their evaluation results. The majority of the paper presents an automatic alignment method for pronominal anaphora in Spanish and English. Once an anaphor has been solved (in both languages) this method matches anaphoric expressions and antecedents from both texts. A bitext map method has been used for the alignment with a set of bilingual texts for the evaluation. These texts have been extracted from several European <b>Community</b> <b>Official</b> documents (EUR-lex database). The alignment mechanism can be applied to different tasks related to Machine Translation such us pattern learning for translation or evaluation for automatic generation of multilingual anaphora. 1...|$|E
40|$|Issues {{concerning}} {{youth and}} serious crime {{have been the}} focus of a great deal of research, debate and concern for police, politicians and the <b>community.</b> <b>Official</b> statistics both in Australia and in the US claim that crime rates for juveniles are increasing. Media reports abound on youth gangs, schoolyard violence, and the ever decr asing age of children accused of serious crimes. Recent hardline crime prevention initiatives have gained considerable attention worldwide. Zero-tolerance policing has been lauded for its success in significantly reducing crime rates in the United States, and its implementation is currently being considered by some jurisdictions in Australia. While, the literature on youth and crime in general is abundant, studies focussing specifically on crimes of a more significant nature are more scarce, both in Australia and internationally. So what do we really know about youth and serious crime? How much of a problem is it in Australasia? Are serious crimes committed by youth increasing? What is being done to address the problem? How successful have these efforts been? These and other questions are considered here. Knowledge about this specific group of offenders has important implications for police, politicians, health and welfare agencies, and the community. Reviewing an...|$|E
