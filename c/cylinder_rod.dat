A double acting engine, in which the steam acted alternately on {{the two sides of the}} piston was one. He described methods for working the steam [...] "expansively" [...] (i.e., using steam at pressures well above atmospheric). A compound engine, which connected two or more engines was described. Two more patents were granted for these in 1781 and 1782. Numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented. One of these included the use of the steam indicator which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume, which he kept as a trade secret. Another important invention, one which Watt was most proud of, was the parallel motion which was essential in double-acting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the <b>cylinder</b> <b>rod</b> and pump, from the connected rocking beam, whose end moves in a circular arc. This was patented in 1784. A throttle valve to control the power of the engine, and a centrifugal governor, patented in 1788, to keep it from [...] "running away" [...] were very important. These improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as efficient in its use of fuel as the Newcomen engine.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} global {{finite element}} simulations of a hydro-pneumatic riser tension cylinder used for tensioning and heave compensating of marine drilling risers. The global {{finite element models}} are made for use on a personal computer, which give some limits in available computational capacity, but convenient {{for use of the}} models. The main goal for the simulations is to find the contact forces acting between the <b>cylinder</b> <b>rod</b> surface layer and the bearing rings inside the stuffing box of the cylinder. This information is needed to understand the reasons for the excessive wear of surface layers that has been experienced and lead to costly damages of heave compensation systems. To establish the models a literature study of riser analysis, heave compensation and friction between surfaces modelling is done and described. Measurement of friction forces in order to identify the Stribeck curve for the bearing material has been done on a test cylinder, lubricated with a fire resistant water glycol hydraulic fluid. The friction force is measured as a function of contact pressure and speed at different temperature, which are the parameters needed to define the Stribeck curve for the actual system. The size of the bearing and the difference in friction force between boundary lubrication friction and mixed lubrication friction described by the Stribeck curve, bring in modelling issues for the time domain analysis. The size of the bearing requires small finite elements, which in turn requires very short time increments in order to obtain stable time integration when using an explicit method. The fast variation in friction force gives convergence issues also for the implicit integration method. Computational costs are therefore high for the applied type of simulation. The results show that metal to metal contact between <b>cylinder</b> <b>rod</b> and stuffing box may occur in certain situations even within the design limit of cylinder, due to high contact pressure and bending of the rod. The main contributing factors to this high contact pressure and bending are: • Bending moments in the cylinder and rod occur due to weight of the structure when it has a spatial inclination relative to the vertical. • Lateral accelerations of the cylinder ends due to vessel and drilling riser motions. • Low bending stiffness of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>rod</b> when the riser tension is low...|$|E

40|$|Generally, fault {{detection}} {{is the process}} of monitoring a physical dynamic system accompanied by confirmation and assessment of any degradation of system performance.

In this paper, a {{fault detection}} algorithm is developed to isolate and detect friction changes in a high precision positioning mechanism. The designed fault detection algorithm addresses dynamic model estimation, dynamic filtering and recursive parameter estimation techniques to monitor on-line friction changes. The procedure is illustrated on a high precision servo pneumatic cylinder that drives a translational air bearing apparatus, designed to permit the addition of friction.

40|$|The sealing {{efficiency}} {{and the extent}} of the friction force in an elastomeric seal - counterpart sliding contact depend highly on the contact characteristics at the interface. In particular, a deep knowledge of the interface contact pressure is needed. The work herein described deals with the design of a new test bench for an indirect contact pressure measurement. In particular, the radial force exerted by a rod seal sliding on a sensor-equipped portion of a <b>cylinder</b> <b>rod</b> is measured; during the seal displacement, the contact area between the seal and the sensorequipped rod increases, so that the radial force trend during time can be acquired. Taking the sliding velocity at a low constant value, contact pressure can be indirectly computed by differentiating the force signal. This way it is possible to perform measurements without introducing a third body between the seal and its counterpart, so avoiding any modification of the contact surface. Initially, the test bench working principle is described, highlighting all critical aspects related to the radial force transmission from the seal to the load sensor; subsequently, the test bench requirements were defined.
