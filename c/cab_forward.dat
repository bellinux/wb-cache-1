25|$|In France, {{the three}} Heilmann {{locomotives}} were built with a <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> design.|$|E
25|$|The only {{preserved}} <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> locomotive is Southern Pacific 4294 in Sacramento, California.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> {{design was}} {{characterized}} by the long, low slung windshield, and relatively short overhangs. The wheels were effectively pushed to {{the corners of the}} car, creating a much larger passenger cabin than the contemporaries of the time.|$|E
50|$|The Jeep Forward Control is a {{truck that}} was {{produced}} by Willys and then Kaiser Jeep from 1956 to 1965. It was also assembled in other international markets. The layout featured a <b>cab</b> over (<b>forward</b> control) design.|$|R
50|$|A {{locomotive}} of that length {{must be an}} articulated locomotive; meaning {{all have}} a joint {{between the first and}} second groups of driving wheels. All examples of this type are <b>cab</b> <b>forwards.</b> Normally, the leading truck sits under the smokebox and the trailing truck under the firebox. On a cab-forward, the leading truck supports the firebox and the trailing truck and smokebox are at the rear next to the tender. A 4-8-8-2 is effectively a 2-8-8-4 that always runs in reverse. Although commonly called Mallets these cab-forwards were built with simple expansion cylinders. The name stuck because the original classes of Southern Pacific cab-forwards were built as compound Mallets, though these were also eventually converted to simple expansion.|$|R
60|$|When the {{ceremony}} was over, and the mourners turned away {{to go back to}} the <b>cabs,</b> Madame pressed <b>forward</b> to Alvina.|$|R
25|$|The appearance, still {{based on}} the <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> {{exterior}} design of the 1987 Lamborghini Portofino concept, with its aerodynamic shape, made for little wind noise inside this large car. This sleek styling gives the Concorde a low drag coefficient which was ahead of its time.|$|E
25|$|The Chrysler Concorde {{is a large}} four-door, full-size, {{front wheel}} drive sedan that was {{produced}} by Chrysler from 1992 to 2004. It assumed the C-body Chrysler New Yorker's position as the entry-level full-size sedan in Chrysler's lineup. One of Chrysler's three original Chrysler LH platform models derived from the American Motors/Renault-designed Eagle Premier, it used revolutionary <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> design. The Concorde {{was related to the}} Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision, Chrysler 300M, Chrysler LHS, and the eleventh and final generation Chrysler New Yorker. It was on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for 1993 and 1994.|$|E
25|$|Cab {{arrangements}} vary by builder and operator. Practice in the U.S. {{has traditionally}} been for a cab {{at one end of}} the locomotive with limited visibility if the locomotive is not operated <b>cab</b> <b>forward.</b> This is not usually a problem as U.S. locomotives are usually operated in pairs, or threes, and arranged so that a cab is at each end of each set. European practice is usually for a cab at each end of the locomotive as trains are usually light enough to operate with one locomotive. Early U.S. practice was to add power units without cabs (booster or B units) and the arrangement was often A-B, A-A, A-B-A, A-B-B, or A-B-B-A where A was a unit with a cab. Center cabs were sometimes used for switch locomotives.|$|E
50|$|White-Freightliner {{introduced}} its first tilting cab-over design in 1958, which allowed the entire <b>cab</b> to tilt <b>forward</b> {{for access to}} the engine.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lower edge}} of the <b>cab</b> window <b>forward</b> of the driver's door and the lower {{edge of the}} driver's {{windscreen}} were horizontal, whereas on pre-war examples they curved downwards towards {{the corner of the}} cab. Also, the lower offside bodyside, behind the rear wheel, did not curve in, as it did ahead of the rear wheel.|$|R
50|$|Two {{vehicles}} out of {{the order}} of fifty were finished as Gun Carrier Cranes, salvage tanks with a hand-operated crane in the front but without the distinctive pair of <b>forward</b> <b>cabs.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Design {{work began}} in 1971. The rounded shape and large glass area were unusual {{compared}} with the three-box designs of the era. The Pacer's width is equal to full-sized domestic vehicles at the time, and this unique design feature was promoted by AMC as [...] "the first wide small car." [...] The Pacer was the first modern, mass-produced, U.S. automobile design using the <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> concept.|$|E
2500|$|Teague {{worked on}} the design of the 1975 AMC Pacer, the first car with <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> design. It was also the first 'wide-small' {{automobile}} that [...] "gave drivers the impression they were driving a conventional large American." [...] Its [...] "styling was different and appealing in an offbeat sort of way" [...] featuring large amounts of glass. The Pacer's low beltline prevented the side door window from lowering completely out of sight, so Teague designed the inner door panels with large bolsters." [...] , the designer of the Porsche 928 body was inspired by the Pacer.|$|E
2500|$|On May 3, 1939, C. P. Huntington {{participated in}} the grand opening ceremonies for the Los Angeles Union Station. Operating under her own steam, the Huntington was paraded past large, cheering crowds to the newly-completed {{passenger}} terminal, along with several other engines, including the famous 4-4-0, Virginia & Truckee 22, the Inyo (still painted in Union Pacific livery, from the filming of Cecil B. DeMille's 1939 movie of the same name, which premiered two days later), and Southern Pacific 4120, a massive AC-5 class 4-8-8-2 <b>cab</b> <b>forward.</b> The moment was captured on film by Disney animator and life-long train enthusiast, Ward Kimball, and may {{be some of the}} only known footage of the engine under steam.|$|E
5000|$|The AC-9 {{was one of}} two Southern Pacific Railroad's {{articulated}} {{steam locomotive}} class that ran smokebox forward after 1920. Twelve AC-9 class locomotives were built by Lima in 1939 and were Southern Pacific's largest and heaviest steam engines, partly a consequence of low quality coal these engines were designed to burn. The AC-9s were partially streamlined (the only articulated steam engines to be so equipped), having [...] "skyline casings" [...] inspired by Lima's GS series of 4-8-4's, also made for Southern Pacific, and were equipped with coal tenders, unlike the <b>cab</b> <b>forwards.</b> The wheel arrangement was 2-8-8-4, which was nicknamed [...] "Yellowstone". Between 1939 and 1952, all the twelve AC-9 engines were in service between Tucumcari, New Mexico, El Paso, Texas, and Tucson, Arizona, where they mainly pulled freight trains and occasionally also passenger trains such as the Golden State Limited. In 1952, they were converted to burn oil instead of coal, and moved to Southern Pacific's Modoc line between Sparks, Nevada, and Alturas, California, where they worked in freight service from 1953 until retirement in 1956.|$|R
50|$|In 1967, as Carpati and Bucegi types became old fashioned, {{a tender}} was {{launched}} {{for a new}} type featuring the following specifications: load capacity of 12-18 tons, diesel engine, a <b>forward</b> <b>cab,</b> observance of CEE-ONU standards.|$|R
50|$|In 1972 the INTRAC {{series of}} {{multi-role}} tractors was unveiled, with multiple automatic hitches for implements, a <b>forward</b> <b>cab</b> layout and a front lift and PTO, making them extremely effective in agricultural, civil and industrial applications alike.|$|R
2500|$|The Premier {{inspired}} {{many of the}} LH platform’s design features. François Castaing, formerly AMC's Vice President {{of product}} engineering and development, became Chrysler's Vice President of vehicle engineering in 1988, and as a result, the Premier was {{the starting point for}} Chrysler's new LH sedans. Although the <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> styling was quite different, the engines in the LH cars were mounted longitudinally, like the Premier. This was [...] "a hallmark of Renault's front-wheel-drive designs" [...] and unlike any other car built by Chrysler to that time. The LH platform's dedicated transmission, the A606, was also quite similar in design to the electronically controlled automatic featured in four-cylinder Premiers. The Premier's body shell was used for LH prototype development mules, under which the LH drivetrain was tested.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States on the Southern Pacific Railroad, {{a series}} of <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> {{locomotives}} were produced with the cab and the firebox {{at the front of}} the locomotive and the tender behind the smokebox, so that the engine appeared to run backwards. This was only possible by using oil-firing. Southern Pacific selected this design to provide air free of smoke for the engine driver to breathe as the locomotive passed through mountain tunnels and snow sheds. Another variation was the Camelback locomotive, with the cab situated halfway along the boiler. In England, Oliver Bulleid developed the SR Leader class locomotive during the nationalisation process in the late 1940s. The locomotive was heavily tested but several design faults (such as coal firing and sleeve valves) meant that this locomotive and the other part-built locomotives were scrapped. The cab-forward design was taken by Bulleid to Ireland, where he moved after nationalisation, where he developed the [...] "turfburner". This locomotive was more successful, but was scrapped due to the dieselisation of the Irish railways.|$|E
50|$|Southern Pacific Railroad's AC-1 {{class of}} <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> steam {{locomotives}} consisted of locomotives rebuilt from MC-1 and MC-2 class locomotives that were originally built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1909. The MC-2 class {{was the first}} class of locomotives built and delivered to SP as <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> locomotives. The AC-1 class {{was the first of}} the successful AC series of <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> locomotives that numbered nearly 200 in total on the SP. The #4002 of the Southern Pacific was Rebuilt in June 1923 as a <b>Cab</b> <b>Forward.</b>|$|E
50|$|Driver Training Tank (Fahrschulpanzer): The Leopard 2 Driver Training Tank, as {{the name}} implies, is a {{non-combatant}} Leopard 2 for instructing soldiers in {{the finer points of}} handling the tank. The turret is supplanted by a weighted and fixed observation <b>cab</b> with <b>forward</b> and side-facing windows and a dummy gun. The instructor rides in this cab, with override controls for critical systems, and space is provided for two other students to observe.|$|R
50|$|The {{truck was}} made from durable metals like {{stainless}} steel, so that the cab could be washed out with a hose. All four doors were designed to slide backwards and forward (much like minivan doors) rather than to swing outwards. It also features an extended <b>cab</b> pushed <b>forward</b> to create more room for passengers, and a truck bed that can be expanded from six feet to eight {{by means of an}} extending tailgate.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} raise money for the group, WSP took in {{contributions}} from individuals, sponsored benefits and also created several [...] "fund-raising stunts." [...] These included [...] "self-denial week" [...] where members saved money by eating ten-cent sandwiches, walked instead of hiring <b>cabs,</b> and <b>forwarded</b> the savings to the WSP. [...] "Sacrifice Day" [...] on August 7, 1914, saw women attending a luncheon where they donated jewelry and watches to further the cause. WSP did not use violent tactics to achieve their goals.|$|R
50|$|The Isuzu N-Series low <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> (LCF) truck {{family is}} {{consistent}} of class 3-5 trucks, {{and the only}} low <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> lineup that includes two diesel engines and a gasoline engine that is CNG/LPG capable.|$|E
50|$|Southern Pacific Railroad's MC-4 {{class of}} steam {{locomotive}} {{was the second}} class ordered and built as <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> locomotives. Southern Pacific (SP) found the MC-2 class sufficient for a proof-of-concept for <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> locomotives and sought to continue with now tested designs.|$|E
50|$|Had it {{not been}} for the {{negotiating}} efforts of the Railway and Locomotive Historical Society in the 1950s, 4294 likely would have been scrapped along with all of the other SP <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> locomotives. As a result, 4294 is the only SP <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> that has been preserved.|$|E
50|$|MAN’s TG {{range of}} trucks is entirely {{conventional}} in design, {{based on a}} C-section ladder-frame chassis mounting an all-steel forward-control cab. The <b>cab</b> tilts <b>forward</b> for engine access and can be supplied {{in a variety of}} compact to crew-cab sizes. Ressenig of Austria has developed an armour solution for the TGS cab. A variety of body types can be fitted throughout the TG range, and in addition to the standard troop carrying/cargo-type body can include fuel or water tankers, shelter/box-type bodies, load handling systems or recovery hampers. Tractor trucks are also available.|$|R
5000|$|... 372: Designed {{for high}} {{efficiency}} and driver comfort, {{this was the}} most aerodynamic [...] Peterbilt cabover ever built. The nose piece of the <b>cab</b> flipped <b>forward</b> (similar to the old 350 COE of the 1950s) allowing access to maintenance items. The 372 was in production from 1988 until 1993. The 372 proved that 10+ MPG can be achieved with a class 8 truck. The truck has the distinction of being the most unusual Peterbilt design offering a sinister Darth Vader look that some also thought looked like a motorhome (think Winnebago) or a football helmet.|$|R
50|$|Visibility {{is greatly}} {{improved}} from the cab, and fumes from the chimney do not fill a <b>forward</b> <b>cab</b> in tunnels. However, the crew's {{prospects in the}} event of a collision are worse, and if the driver and fireman are in separate places it is difficult for them to communicate, just as in autotrains.|$|R
5000|$|Southern Pacific class AC-12, a {{class of}} <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> steam {{locomotives}} ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Number 4000 {{before it}} was {{converted}} to a <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> locomotive.|$|E
50|$|In France, {{the three}} Heilmann {{locomotives}} were built with a <b>cab</b> <b>forward</b> design.|$|E
50|$|The {{medium sized}} truck series also {{included}} Volvo’s first forward control truck, LV75. The <b>cab</b> was moved <b>forward</b> {{so that the}} driver sat beside the engine instead of the gear box like a conventional truck. This gives a better weight distribution between {{the front and rear}} axle, resulting in reduced rear axle load.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicle is}} {{provided}} with a central tyre pressure regulation system (to allow its adaptation {{to the nature of}} the traversed ground), a headlight with white light on the <b>forward</b> <b>cab</b> roof and, if necessary, with a snow plough SSP 1000 or a dozer blade BZ-T to arrange its own emplacement or to remove obstacles.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} was {{altered by}} 'chopping' the front hood containing the dynamic brake components and altering the <b>cab</b> for better <b>forward</b> visibility. It was then renumbered as DA 822 and was painted in Tasman's orange-brown colours before it entered service at Kawerau. This allowed the Bagnall to be withdrawn, and later scrapped after briefly being {{offered to the}} Bay of Islands Vintage Railway.|$|R
