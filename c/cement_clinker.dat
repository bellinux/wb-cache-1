40|$|ABSTRACT: Tricalcium {{silicate}} (Ca 3 SiO 5) {{is heavily}} {{used in industry}} {{as it is the}} most predominant constituent in Portland <b>cement</b> <b>clinkers.</b> In this work, using ab-initio calculations, we assess the ability of a large selection of substitutions to modify the electronic structure in the M 3 polymorph of tricalcium silicate. We demonstrate the relation between electronic structure, hybridization of the impurity orbitals, and charge transfer from impurity atoms to the bulk material. Our work suggests that charge localization upon introducing impurities can passivate the reactive sites and several such substitutions are identified. Tricalcium silicate (Ca 3 SiO 5 or C 3 S) is considered to be the most predominant compound in ordinary Portland <b>cement</b> <b>clinkers,</b> at ∼ 50 − 70 wt %. 1, 2 C 3 S is usually chemically modified upon substituting with impurities, forming a solid solutio...|$|R

2500|$|Portland <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> {{is made by}} heating, in {{a cement}} kiln, a mixture of raw {{materials}} to a calcining temperature of above [...] and then a fusion temperature, which is about [...] for modern cements, to sinter the materials into clinker. The materials in <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> are alite, belite, tri-calcium aluminate, and tetra-calcium alumino ferrite. The aluminium, iron, and magnesium oxides are present as a flux allowing the calcium silicates to form at a lower temperature, and contribute little to the strength. For special cements, such as Low Heat (LH) and Sulfate Resistant (SR) types, {{it is necessary to}} limit the amount of tricalcium aluminate (3CaO·Al2O3) formed. The major raw material for the clinker-making is usually limestone (CaCO3) mixed with a second material containing clay as source of alumino-silicate. Normally, an impure limestone which contains clay or SiO2 is used. The CaCO3 content of these limestones can be as low as 80%. Secondary raw materials (materials in the raw mix other than limestone) depend on the purity of the limestone. Some of the materials used are clay, shale, sand, iron ore, bauxite, fly ash, and slag. When a cement kiln is fired by coal, the ash of the coal acts as a secondary raw material.|$|E

2500|$|In Portland <b>cement</b> <b>clinker,</b> calcium aluminoferrite {{occurs as}} an [...] "interstitial phase", {{crystallizing}} from the melt. Its presence in clinker is solely {{due to the}} need to obtain liquid at the peak kiln processing temperature (1400−1450°C), facilitating the formation of the desired silicate phases. Apart from this benefit, its effects on cement properties are little more than those of a diluent. Its forms an impure solid solution that deviates markedly in composition from the simple chemical formula. The calcium aluminoferrite phase acts as a repository for many of the minor elements in the clinker. Most of the transitional elements in the cement are found in the ferrite phase, notably titanium, manganese and zinc. There is also a substantial amount of magnesium and silicon, and because of this, oxides other than CaO, Al2O3 and Fe2O3 often make up 15% of the mass of the calcium aluminoferrite. This substitution reduces the melting point to around 1350°C.|$|E
