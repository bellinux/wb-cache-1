40|$|The aim of {{this review}} was to {{describe}} a patient with serotonin toxicity after an overdose of dextromethorphan and <b>chlorphenamine</b> and to perform a systematic literature review exploring whether dextromethorphan and <b>chlorphenamine</b> may be equally contributory {{in the development of}} serotonin toxicity in overdose. A Medline literature review was undertaken to identify cases of serotonin toxicity due to dextromethorphan and/or <b>chlorphenamine.</b> Case reports were included if they included information on the ingested dose or plasma concentrations of dextromethorphan and/or <b>chlorphenamine,</b> information about co-ingestions and detailed clinical information to evaluate for serotonin toxicity. Cases were reviewed by two toxicologists and serotonin toxicity, defined by the Hunter criteria, was diagnosed when appropriate. The literature was then reviewed to evaluate whether <b>chlorphenamine</b> may be a serotonergic agent. One hundred and fifty-five articles of dextromethorphan or <b>chlorphenamine</b> poisoning were identified. There were 23 case reports of dextromethorphan, of which 18 were excluded for lack of serotonin toxicity.

40|$|Background: The {{common cold}} and other viral airway infections are highly {{prevalent}} in the population, and their treatment often {{requires the use of}} medications for symptomatic relief. Paracetamol is as an analgesic and antipyretic; <b>chlorphenamine</b> is an antihistamine; and phenylephrine, a vasoconstrictor and decongestant. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination of paracetamol, <b>chlorphenamine</b> and phenylephrine in the symptomatic treatment of the common cold and flu-like syndrome in adults. Methods: This study enrolled 146 individuals aged 18 to 60 years who had moderate to severe flu-like syndrome or common cold. After clinical examination and laboratory tests, individuals were randomly assigned to receive the fixed-dose combination (73) or placebo (73), five capsules per day for 48 to 72 hours. The primary efficacy endpoint was the sum of the scores of 10 symptoms on a four-point Likert-type scale. To evaluate treatment safety, the occurrence of adverse events was also measured. Results: Mean age was 33. 5 (± 9. 5) years in the placebo group and 33. 8 (± 11. 5) in the treatment group. There were 55 women and 18 men in the placebo group, and 46 women and 27 men in the treatment group. Comparison of overall symptom scores in the two groups revealed a significantly greater reduction in the treatment group than in the placebo group (p = 0. 015). Analysis at the first 13 dose intervals (± 66 h of treatment) showed a greater reduction of symptom scores in the treatment group than in the placebo group (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Premedication with benzodiazepines {{has been}} thought to reduce patient anxiety, pain perception, and non-cath-eter-induced {{coronary}} spasms and may increase procedure-related complications. We used to routinely provide premedication with diazepam and chlorpheniramine before cardiac catheterization procedures. However the benefi ts {{of such a}} treatment are not well established here. Therefore, we designed this study to test whether the routine use of premedication during coronary angiography is needed. Methods: A total of 200 consecutive patients scheduled to undergo either diagnostic or therapeutic coronary angiographic procedures were randomized to receive either premedication with diazepam (5 mg) and chlorpheniramine (4 mg) 60 minutes prior to their proce-dures (n = 100) or no premedication (n = 100). The administration of intravenous midazolam during the procedures was permitted at the operator’s discretion. The primary endpoints were anxiety and pain perception during the procedure. Results: A total of 200 patients with similar baseline characteris-tics were randomized into two groups. The fi rst group received oral premedication with diazepam (5 mg) and <b>chlorphenamine</b> (4 mg) 60 minutes prior to their procedures, and the other group did not re-ceive premedication. We observed no differences in periprocedural pain perception (31 % in the premedicated group versus 29 % in the non-premedicated group; P = 0. 75) or anxiety (59 % in the premedi-cated group versus 50 % in the non-premedicated group; P = 0. 2). Interestingly, local pain was more pronounced in the premedicated patients than in the non-premedicated patients (30 % versus 16 %, respectively; P = 0. 018). There were no contrast-related reactions reported in either group.

In order to compare the exactitude of the different calibration methods, a one-way ANOVA test was performed. In these analyses, only the CLS calibration method produced a significantly different prediction.

It is examined whether smaller half-fractional and full factorial designs with fewer experiments tend to reliably predict retention {{times of the}} latter compounds as well. Simplified regression modelling, however, neglecting more first-order and interactive effects and disregarding pure second-order effects,, has to be set up. These smaller designs finally satisfy the prediction of the retention of MPHB, PPHB and PE also. Retention prediction of CPM is much less accurate. CPM has a pK(a) value of 4. 0, which is encompassed by the examined mobile phase pH limits 3. 9 and 5. 0. Since the largest retention shifts occur near the pK(a) value, retention prediction in this area becomes more complex.

A 34 -year-old woman presented to the emergency unit with severe chest pain from 2 h. She reported a medical history of asthma. On arrival, her heart rate was 125 beats/min and her systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 70 mmHg. A repeated electrocardiogram displayed dynamic changes with ST-segment elevation in D 1 -aVL leads and ST-segment depression in infero-posterior leads. Two episodes of ventricular fibrillation were observed. The coronary artery angiography showed multivessel coronary vasospasms. Intracoronary nitroglycerin was used to alleviate the coronary vasospasms. Contemporaneously, the patient's husband came to the hospital reporting a history of ketorolac consumption some hours before the onset of the acute event for headache symptoms.

40|$|Previously we have {{developed}} a transgenic zebrafish line (LiPan) with liver-specific red fluorescent protein (DsRed) expression under the fabp 10 a promoter. Since red fluorescence in the liver greatly facilitates the observation of liver in live LiPan fry, we envision that the LiPan zebrafish may provide a useful tool in analyses of hepatotoxicity based on changes of liver red fluorescence intensity and size. In this study, we first tested four well-established hepatotoxins (acetaminophen, aspirin, isoniazid and phenylbutazone) in LiPan fry and demonstrated that these hepatotoxins could significantly reduce both liver red fluorescence and liver size in a dosage-dependent manner, thus the two measurable parameters {{could be used as}} indicators of hepatotoxicity. We then tested the LiPan fry with nine other chemicals including environmental toxicants and human drugs. Three (mefenamic acid, lindane, and arsenate) behave like hepatotoxins in reduction of liver red fluorescence, while three others (17 β-estradiol, TCDD [2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin] and NDMA [N-nitrosodimethylamine]) caused increase of liver red fluorescence and the liver size. Ethanol and two other chemicals, amoxicillin (antibiotics) and <b>chlorphenamine</b> (pain killer) did not resulted in significant changes of liver red fluorescence and liver size. By quantitative RT-PCR analysis, we found that the changes of red fluorescence intensity caused by different chemicals correlated to the changes of endogenous fabp 10 a RNA expression, indicating that the measured hepatotoxicity was related to fatty acid transportation and metabolism. Finally we tested a mixture of four hepatotoxins and observed a significant reduction of red fluorescence in the liver at concentrations below the lowest effective concentrations of individual hepatotoxins, suggesting that the transgenic zebrafish assay is capable of reporting compound hepatotoxicity effect from chemical mixtures. Thus, the LiPan transgenic fry provide a rapid and convenient in vivo hepatotoxicity assay that should be applicable to high-throughput hepatotoxicity test in drug screening as well as in biomonitoring environmental toxicants...|$|E

Analyses of suspected product obtained from seven different batches were performed using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) with multiple data processing tools and multivariate analyses. In addition, 23 individual powdered herbs (12 as per label claim and 11 suspected herbs), 11 marker compounds of the labeled herbs and five suspected synthetic drugs as adulterants were also concurrently analyzed to have clear understanding of product composition. Based on our analysis, the major ingredients of studied product were found to be 5 synthetic compounds: caffeine, <b>chlorphenamine,</b> piroxicam, betamethasone and oxethazaine. Three of them have been found to exceed their recommended doses. From the herbal composition analysis, GanCao (Glycyrrhizae radix et rhizoma) was found to be the main ingredient, which is not among the claimed 12 herbs that were supposed to be in the product. Other herbs detected as minor ingredients were MuGua (Chaenomelis fructus), DangGui (Angelicae sinensis radix), and HuangQi (Astragali radix), which are among the 12 herbs that were supposed to be in the product. Based on our results we demonstrated that UPLC-QTOF MS is an effective and versatile tool for the analysis of herbal medicinal products. It is highly desirable to have a streamlined process with automatic workflow and fit-for-purpose database to increase efficiency and productivity of sample analysis. Results of this work also highlight the need for the better quality control and regulatory measures to protect consumers from the potentially harmful effects of such adulterated products...|$|E
30|$|MP, a 28  year old woman, P 0 [*]+[*] 1, on OCP since 14  years of age {{underwent}} laparoscopy and hysteroscopy for dysmenorrhoea and dyspareunia. It {{was noted}} that in childhood she had bladder/ureteric surgery and also suffered from mild asthma (but did not use any medication over the last twelve months). Laparoscopy was performed through left upper quadrant entry port, endometriosis was treated with diathermy and a Mirena IUD was inserted. A litre of Adept solution {{was left in the}} peritoneal cavity. Four hours later she complained of shortness of breath and chest pain radiating to her back. Her pulse was 80  bpm, BP 110 / 70, temperature 35.5 °C, oxygen saturation 100 % on air and chest was clear. The pain settled with analgesia. On the next day she developed another episode of shortness of breath with wheezing, cyanosis, uncontrolled shaking and angio-oedema. Her respiratory rate went up to 24 /minute, pulse 120  bpm, BP 90 / 40, oxygen saturation on air 92 %. There was marked bronchospasm with reduced air entry to the base of both lungs indicative of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction. Investigations which included blood gases, full blood count, urea and electrolytes, CRP and ECG were all normal. Her condition improved after administration of 2  mg of adrenaline, prednisolone and <b>chlorphenamine.</b> She had a chest X-ray which showed a raised right hemidiaphragm. On the second post-operative day she started coughing and choking. There was now marked facial angio-oedema and shortness of breath. She had another hypoxic episode despite administration of 10  litres/minute of oxygen with oxygen saturation of 92 % and pulse of 112  bpm. Adrenaline was administered again and her condition improved. A spiral CT and a V/Q scan excluded pulmonary embolism. She had a further episode of shortness of breath with tremors, which again responded to adrenaline. A neurologist attributed her tremors to possible hypoxia or hyperactivity reaction related to icodextrin (which has been reported in patients who are on chronic abdominal peritoneal dialysis with 7.5 % icodextrin). She had one last episode of shortness of breath with tachycardia, which settled with adrenaline and no further episodes after the fourth postoperative day. She was referred to the Royal Brompton Hospital for further investigations of her allergic reactions.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} what medicines related information children/young people or their parents/carers {{are able to}} recall following an out-patient clinic appointment. METHOD: A convenience sample of patients' prescribed at least one new long-term (> 6 weeks) medicine were recruited from a single UK paediatric hospital out-patient pharmacy. A face-to-face semi-structured questionnaire was administered to participants when they presented with their prescription. The questionnaire included the following themes: names of the medicines, therapeutic indication, dose regimen, duration of treatment and adverse effects. The results were analysed using Microsoft Excel 2013. RESULTS: One hundred participants consented and {{were included in the}} study. One hundred and forty-five medicines were prescribed in total. Participants were able to recall the names of 96 (66 %) medicines and were aware of the therapeutic indication for 142 (97. 9 %) medicines. The dose regimen was accurately described for 120 (82. 8 %) medicines with the duration of treatment known for 132 (91 %). Participants mentioned that they had been advised about side effects for 44 (30. 3 %) medicines. Specific counselling points recommended by the BNFc 1, were either omitted or not recalled by participants for the following systemic treatments: cetirizine (1), <b>chlorphenamine</b> (1), desmopressin (2), hydroxyzine (2), itraconazole (1), piroxicam (2), methotrexate (1), stiripentol (1) and topiramate (1). CONCLUSION: Following an out-patient consultation, where a new medicine is prescribed, children and their parents/carers are usually able to recall the indication, dose regimen and duration of treatment. Few were able to recall, or were told about, possible adverse effects. This may include some important drug specific effects that require vigilance during treatment. Patients, along with families and carers, should be involved in the decision to prescribe a medicine. 2 This includes a discussion about the benefits of the medicine on the patient's condition and possible adverse effects. 2 Treatment side effects {{have been shown to be}} a factor in treatment non-adherence in paediatric long-term medical conditions. 3 Practitioners should explain to patients, and their family members or carers where appropriate, how to identify and report medicines-related patient safety incidents. 4 However, this study suggests that medical staff may not be comfortable discussing the adverse effects of medicines with patients or their parents/carers. Further research in to the shared decision making process in the paediatric out-patient clinic when a new long-term medicine is prescribed is required to further support medicines adherence and the patient safety agenda...|$|E
