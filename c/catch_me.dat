5|$|<b>Catch</b> <b>Me</b> If You Can is a 2002 American biographical crime film {{directed}} and co-produced by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Jeff Nathanson.

His primary crime was check fraud; he became so experienced that the FBI eventually turned to him for help in catching other checking forgers. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, with Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, and Nathalie Baye in supporting roles.|$|E

50|$|Amazon {{reviewer}} Margot Mifflin observed:McCarthy's declarative style, sharpened with {{a jagged}} edge of irony, keeps Trouble Light free of sentimental indulgence.

A poem set on the Fourth of July ends with the poignant understatement (coming from a vet), 'The noise of fireworks <b>catches</b> <b>me</b> off guard.'Trouble Light is wistful and precise, suffused with the sensuality of nature, strewn with detritus of industry and haunted by the ghosts of war. Its power lies in its terrific restraint...|$|R
