In this paper, we study the succinctness of regular expressions (REs) extended with interleaving, intersection and counting operators. We show that in a translation from REs with interleaving to standard regular expressions a double exponential size increase <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be <b>avoided.</b> We also consider the complexity of translations to finite automata.

The wise man will act virtuously, since he will see it as the right thing to do. But the ignorant man <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>avoid</b> vice. The Stoic position held that a sage will possess all the virtues in their fullness. Aristo had argued that there is really only one virtue differentiated as somehow disposed in relation to something. This seemed to be too much like the Megarian position. Chrysippus thus came to see the virtues as distinct bodies, inseparable from each other somehow disposed in themselves and not in relation to something. Thus the need for the third category.|$|E

50|$|The film {{focuses on}} the late stages of life of Rikyū, during the highly {{turbulent}} Sengoku period of feudal Japan. It starts {{near the end of}} Oda Nobunaga's reign, with Rikyū serving as tea master to Nobunaga, and continues into the Momoyama Period. Rikyū is portrayed as a man thoroughly dedicated to aesthetics and perfection, especially in relation to the art of tea. While serving as tea master to the new ruler Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Rikyū finds himself in a uniquely privileged position, with constant access to the powerful feudal lord and the theoretical ability to influence policy, yet he studiously avoids deep involvement in politics while attempting to focus his full attention to the study and teachings of the way of tea. To the extent that he expresses himself, he does so diplomatically, in a way to avoid disrupting the harmony of his relationship with Hideyoshi. Yet, as society is changed violently and radically around him, also finding himself the focus of jealousy and misdirected suspicions, Rikyū ultimately <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>avoid</b> confronting larger social issues. He is compelled to express an opinion on Hideyoshi's military plans. This one breach of his studied isolation from world affairs leads quickly to tragic consequences.|$|E

Ian is amazed by the spectacles of heroism that is flashed before them as the Doctor recalls this, but the Doctor notes that there was also a dark side to this—recalling the many death which fell behind him, deaths which would lead to wars and more deaths. He recalls how we started the Time War inadvertently between his people and the Daleks, and how he had to end the war to save the universe. As Ian shows the Doctor all the good that he has done for the universe and all the lives that he has saved, the Doctor is finally able to accept himself for how the universe sees him and the pair escape the psychic realm.|$|E

Once all three are up, the pilot and copilot ignore Andre's plans and fugitives, and fugitives ignore the sudden change pilot so Robin decides armed hijack the plane. Therefore, the plane takes off and surprise the police orders to cancel the flight (thanks to Paulino puff), Robin in principle stands firm on keeping kidnapped the plane in which Carlos and Andres vainly trying to dissuade her. Captain Pinzón police orders to stop the plane but Robin requisition even taking orders pilot at gunpoint to ignore your calls and requires the aircraft to take off.
