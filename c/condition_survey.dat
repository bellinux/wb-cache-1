Some of the most important sources of information {{for the development of the}} EWCS questionnaire are the national <b>surveys</b> on working <b>conditions.</b> This compilation is a follow-up of a study of working <b>conditions</b> <b>surveys</b> commissioned by Eurofound in 2006 which covered both national and transnational working <b>conditions</b> <b>surveys</b> (Eurofound, 2007). The main goals of this inventory are to: update the background information on existing national working conditions surveys; create a source of basic information from national working <b>conditions</b> <b>surveys</b> related to methodologies, quality control procedures, fieldwork and findings; provide a practical resource for researchers, policymakers, social partners and others with a professional interest in working conditions...|$|R
