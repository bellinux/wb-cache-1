40|$|The {{quality of}} roll formed {{products}} {{is known to}} be highly dependent on the process design. In addition, unavoidable variations of material properties during mass production can have a significant deteriorating effect on the product quality. This study focuses on the question how to <b>compensate</b> for <b>product</b> defects while simultaneously minimizing the sensitivity for variation of material properties. This is achieved by using robust optimization techniques to determine the optimal process settings of adjustable tools in the final roll forming stand. The work covers both numerical analyses as well as experiments. Initial roll forming experiments of an Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) V-section profile showed a significant amount of longitudinal bow and springback in the final product. Finite Element (FE) simulations are subsequently performed to determine the relationship between adjustable process settings and uncontrollable variation of incoming material properties with respect to the product defects. The computationally expensive non-linear FE simulations are subsequently replaced by the best performing metamodel chosen from of a family of metamodels. Using these metamodels, the optimal robust process settings for the adjustable stand are determined and the effect on product quality analyzed. The results show that the effect of scattering material properties on the dimensional quality of the roll formed product is significant. Moreover, it is shown that the adjustment of the tooling in the final roll stand leads to a significantly improved <b>product</b> quality by <b>compensating</b> for <b>product</b> defects and minimizing the deteriorating effects of scattering variables...|$|R

Up to now, {{there is no evidence}} of any physiological mechanism leading to hatching sex ratio deviations. The primary follicles in prophase I are already supplied with considerable amounts of yolk and chromosomal segregation distortion appears to be highly constrained by the mechanism of meiotic division. Also, genetic interests of gametes strongly oppose any maternal attempt at control of the sex ratio. Hence, sex ratio manipulation by preferential ovulation of Z- or W-ova is argued to be implausible. More probably, to avoid any further loss of investment, sex ratio adjustment should take place early after ovulation and fertilisation via sex-specific termination of embryonic development before initiation of egg shell formation. I suggest that the widely reported influence of the position within the egg laying sequence on offspring sex could potentially serve as an explanation for a wide range of sex ratio effects found in birds. The sequence effect, in turn, might be caused by changes in concentrations of yolk testosterone over the laying sequence. This effect could be sex-specific if non-dosage <b>compensated</b> gene <b>products</b> of Z-chromosomes counteracted any adverse effects on embryonic survival of deviating testosterone levels...|$|R

Modern production theory is used to explain the quantity indicator by means of a productivity and activity effect. Lastly, the productivity indicator is broken down into operating efficiency, allocative efficiency and technical change.

40|$|Subsurface drip {{distribution}} {{is an important}} on-site wastewater treatment technique which is widely used with various soil types and restricted site conditions. It can distribute pretreated wastewater uniformly into soil. Some recent field applications showed low application uniformities, which was reflected in overloading of the field near the supply manifold while low emitter discharge rates occurred {{at the end of}} lateral. Designers are seeking appropriate operation pressures and drip zone configurations to improve system application uniformity. This research was conducted to test some popular wastewater drip products in both lab and field-scale experiments. The first goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate the performance of five subsurface drip products under eight operational pressures ranging from 0 to 310 kPa (45 psi). After evaluation of each group of 60 emitters, results showed that Netafim Bioline pressure compensating (PC) emitters exhibited a uniformity coefficient (UC) of 95 % with a coefficient of variance (Cv) of 4. 9 %. The average UC of Geoflow Wasteflow products is 94. 4 % and Cv value is 6. 8 %. Flow rate and pressure relationships (Q-H curves) were developed for each drip emitter tested. By analyzing low and normal operational pressure ranges, Q-H curves were fitted to the data and resulted in R 2 values ranging from 1. 000 to 0. 414. Geoflow pressure <b>compensating</b> <b>products</b> possess the features of non-pressure compensating emitters under low pressure head. Netafim PC products are characterized as pressure compensating over the full range of operational pressures and emit water with nominal uniformity during low pressure range. To evaluate drip zone configurations with respect to distribution uniformity, a field-scale experiment was set up and three drip tubing products were tested in different dosing and operation schemes. Three factors of wastewater drip system design were tested. System operation pressure (138 kPa/ 20 psi and 276 kPa/ 40 psi); different pressure control components (pressure regulator/recirculation valve) and schemes (continuous flushing/intermittent flushing); and supply line length (7. 6 m/ 25 ft, 15. 2 m/ 50 ft, and 30. 4 m/ 100 ft) were evaluated to compare their influence on water application uniformity. It was concluded that, for Geoflow PC and NPC products, among all three factors, system operational pressure has the greatest effect on drip system application uniformity; supply line length has the least influence. For Netafim PC tubing, pressure control scheme has the greatest effect on drip system application uniformity; supply line length has the least influence. The optimal combination of the three factors could save more than 10 minutes of dosing time to meet the required dosing application uniformity.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} for the deep-drawing process is springback. Generally, the deep-drawing tools are directly derived from {{the shape of the}} product. However, when the press is opened after forming, the product will spring back due to internal stresses. In order to produce a geometrically accurate product, the geometry of the tools is compensated. The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm to perform this task automatically, with the use of FE deep-drawing simulations. In this report the two main compensation algorithms are discussed that are mentioned in literature. Springback compensation is always the last step in the process planning of a deep drawn product. It is not always needed, in some cases the product can be made to fit the assembly by simply pushing it back into the right shape. To make the right decision, springback has to be measured and evaluated properly, which can be hard for complex shaped products. Today, manual springback compensation is applied, based on the measurements on prototype products. This is a time consuming process for which a lot of experience is needed. The use of FE simulations can speed up this process, but to fully use the detailed results of such a simulation, a compensation algorithm has to be used. The first algorithm is called the smooth displacement adjustment (SDA) method. The method is based on a direct comparison of the desired shape and the shape after springback. The idea is to compensate springback by reversing the springback deformation field and applying this to the product geometry. The method can also be applied iteratively by using the shape deviation field between the springback (actual) geometry and the reference (desired) geometry. A smoothing/extrapolation function has been added, so the new toolset can be derived directly from this <b>compensated</b> <b>product</b> geometry. The method has been tested on a real industrial part, a trunk-lid inner frame that has been adopted as a benchmark part for the NUMISHEET 2005 conference. The method was very successful, after compensation the mean shape deviation was lowered by 70 %. However, some large shape deviation was still present in the product flanges, showing that there is still room for improvement. The second algorithm is called the springforward (SF) method. The principle of the SF method is to compensate springback with the internal stresses that cause it, instead of applying direct geometric optimization, such as the DA method. The method was applied to an academic process, the plastic bending of a strip. It is explained that with the current definition of the algorithm, iterative application is not useful. This problem is solved by adding a push-back stage, so the compensation is linked to the desired geometry again. However, the actual calculation of the compensated geometry suffers from large principal and numerical problems, as was demonstrated using a simple industrial product. ...|$|R

On a second step a linear model computes the increments on the controllable variables to compensate small deviations in design assumptions, due to the variability of the manufacturing processes. In this model the in-plant controllable variables are adjusted (number of windings and wire diameters).

To improve crop production systems and labour management, a generic process modelling approach was developed enabling the impact of different scenarios on labour productivity to be assessed. The crop production system with crop handling processes {{is defined as a}} stochastic discrete event system. This paper demonstrates the model flexibility and transferability by adapting an existing model developed for a mobile rose production system to a model for a static growing system for cut roses. The paper describes the adaptation process. The adapted model was validated for the harvest process at a 3. 6 ha production site in the Netherlands. Work scenarios were simulated to examine effects of skill, equipment, and harvest management. The model reproduces the harvest process accurately. A seven workday validation for an average skilled harvester showed a relative root mean squared error (RRMSE) under 5 % for both labour time and harvest rate. A validation over 96 days for various harvesters showed a higher RRMSE, 15. 2 % and 13. 6 % for labour time and harvest rate respectively, mainly caused by the absence of model parameters for individual harvesters. The model was successfully used in scenario studies and indicated that worker skill was an important cost factor, differences associated with harvest trolley type are small, and that an extra harvest cycle per day is only feasible when <b>compensated</b> by <b>product</b> price. Overall, the generic model concept performs well for a static growing system when extended with system specific properties and process elements. (C) 2013 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The second type of phage-induced radioresistance requires the gam product of lambda and is observed in wild-type and polA strains. The lambda gam+ gene produce must be present immediately after irradiation to exert its full effect.

40|$|Among the obligate aerobic {{bacteria}}, {{acetic acid}} bacteria {{are well known}} for their powerful ability to oxidize alcohols, sugars, or sugar alcohols and to accumulate the corresponding oxidation products in the culture medium. These reactions are restricted to one-step incomplete oxidation (so-called oxidative fermentation) and are catalyzed by primary dehydrogenases located on the outer surface of the cytoplasmic membrane, the active sites of which face the periplasmic space. All enzyme activities are linked, without exception, to the terminal ubiquinol oxidase via ubiquinone in the respiratory chain of the organisms. The respective primary dehydrogenases working in the periplasmic sugar and alcohol respirations include many unique pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) -dependent dehydroge-nases (quinoproteins and quinoprotein–cytochrome c complexes) and fl avin ade-nine dinucleotide (FAD) -dependent dehydrogenases (fl avoprotein–cytochrome c complexes).

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] COX- 2 inhibitors are newly developed drugs which are widely used for controlling pain and inflammation. Blocking this enzyme impedes the production of the prostaglandins that cause pain and swelling. However certain prostaglandins are also important in maintaining blood flow to the kidneys. In addition to prostaglandins, nitric oxide is another vasodilator which is very important in modulating vascular tone and renal blood flow.

Macula densa is a specialized structure in the kidney which co-localizes these two enzymes and is very important in maintaining the renal blood flow.

Most farms in Ireland have a cattle enterprise, either alone or in combination with other land using enterprises.

Drip tapes tested in this study have design discharge rates of 4. 00 L/hr @ 206. 84 Kpa (1. 06 gph @ 30 psi), 1. 02 L/hr @ 55. 16 Kpa (0. 27 gph @ 8 psi), 3. 785 L/hr @ 172. 37 Kpa (1. 00 gph @ 25 psi), 3. 785 L/hr @ 172. 37 Kpa (1. 00 gph @ 25 psi), and 0. 984 L/hr @ 206. 84 Kpa (0. 26 gph @ 20 psi), respectively. All of them, except T-Tape, were pressure compensating (PC) emitters; the T-Tape was non-pressure compensating (NPC). For all products, except Toro, the emitter spacing was 0. 305 m (12 inches) and for Toro, it was 0. 46 m (18 inches). Mister_PS (MLD- 1 PC 25) was the point source (PS) emitter and all others were line source emitters. Drip products were tested with 15 different operating pressures ranging from 5. 97 KPa (0. 87 psi) to 344. 74 KPa (50. 00 psi). From an evaluation of 60 emitters from each product, the Toro brand showed an average uniformity coefficient (UC) of 91. 24 %, with a coefficient of variation (Cv) of 0. 06, T-Tape drip products showed an average UC of 96. 63 % with a Cv of 0. 04, Mister_ LS showed an average UC of 93. 12 % with a Cv of 0. 08, Mister_PS showed an average UC of 96. 33 % with a Cv of 0. 04, and Netafim showed an average UC of 97. 92 % with a Cv of 0. 02.
