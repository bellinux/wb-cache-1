The Mini Mode brand was {{not affected by}} the administration at this time. 111 stores <b>closed,</b> <b>shedding</b> 850 jobs, but the administrators remained hopeful that Adams would still find a buyer. 160 of the stores then remained. On 26 January, a further 36 stores were closed. 125 of the stores continued to trade, while the situation was assessed.|$|E

40|$|This {{has been}} the second Bioinformatics Workshop {{organized}} at Covenant University {{with the aim of}} bringing together Biologists and Bioinformaticians. The main goal of these workshops is to provide a way for specialists in both fields to get to-gether and exchange knowledge and experi-ence. The workshop is structured around a series of talks that introduce key concepts (of Biology for Bioinformaticians and of Bioinformatics for Biologists) and a series of hands-on practical ses-sions where relevant tools are demonstrated and tried first-hand by assistants. This basic scheme, provides a nurturing medium where specialists in both areas can talk, interact and get <b>closer,</b> <b>shedding</b> the seed of future collaborations...|$|R

50|$|The term {{shedding}} {{refers to}} the action of creating a shed. A shedding device is the device used to raise or open the shed. Creating the separation {{is referred to as}} raising or opening the shed, while the reverse is known as lowering or <b>closing</b> the <b>shed.</b>|$|R

50|$|By 1950 under British Railways, the {{combined}} depots of Cathays and Radyr (Code:88A), had a complement of 82 locomotives, all tank-types: 2x2-8-2T; 62x0-6-2T; 15x0-6-0T; 3x0-4-2T. In 1959 the shed was divided {{to cope with}} the introduction of diesel multiple units. In 1961 the <b>shed</b> <b>closed</b> to steam, and all steam locomotives were moved to Radyr. The <b>shed</b> <b>closed</b> completely in November 1964, {{with the opening of the}} newly diesel-redeveloped Cardiff Canton TMD. Shortly afterwards the site was cleared for redevelopment.|$|R
50|$|When {{no longer}} {{required}} for goods traffic goods sheds {{have often been}} converted for other uses, such as the booking office at Paignton railway station, or as housing. When many rural branch lines in New Zealand were <b>closed,</b> goods <b>sheds</b> along the <b>closed</b> branches often formed integral parts of the depots of road freight companies that replaced the railway.|$|R
50|$|Rodent {{control in}} and around the home remains the primary {{prevention}} strategy, as well as eliminating contact with rodents in the workplace and campsite. <b>Closed</b> storage <b>sheds</b> and cabins are often ideal sites for rodent infestations. Airing out of such spaces prior to use is recommended. Avoid direct contact with rodent droppings and wear a mask to avoid inhalation of aerosolized rodent secretions.|$|R

5000|$|Cavendish's {{equipment}} was remarkably sensitive for its time. The force involved in twisting the torsion balance was very small, , about [...] {{of the weight}} of the small balls. To prevent air currents and temperature changes from interfering with the measurements, Cavendish placed the entire apparatus in a wooden box about 2 ft thick, 10 ft tall, and 10 ft wide, all in a <b>closed</b> <b>shed</b> on his estate. Through two holes in the walls of the shed, Cavendish used telescopes to observe the movement of the torsion balance's horizontal rod. The motion of the rod was only about 0.16 in. Cavendish was able to measure this small deflection to an accuracy of better than one hundredth of an inch using vernier scales on the ends of the rod.Cavendish's accuracy was not exceeded until C. V. Boys' experiment in 1895. In time, Michell's torsion balance became the dominant technique for measuring the gravitational constant (G) and most contemporary measurements still use variations of it. This is why Cavendish's experiment became the Cavendish experiment.|$|R
