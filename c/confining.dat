5|$|All of Florida's {{abundant}} {{fresh water}} {{is the result of}} precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers. However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a <b>confining</b> layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the <b>confining</b> layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the <b>confining</b> layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible {{in the northern part of}} Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.|$|E

The hurricane's forward motion shifted to west-northwest, and forecast models indicated that Georges would re-attain Category 3 status before making landfall along the northern Gulf Coast. The slow motion of the storm led to an erratic track, mainly caused by westward wobbles of the eye.

5|$|Spinal disc {{herniation}} {{occurs when}} the Intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides.

Cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by <b>confining</b> the animal to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, and this can be accompanied by medication for the pain.

5|$|Studies {{suggest that}} the Af9 protein acts as a {{repressor}} of Tbr1 in the upper layers of the six-layer developing cerebral cortex, thereby <b>confining</b> Tbr1 to the lower cortical layers (preplate, subplate, layer VI). This process is regulated through interaction of Af9 with the methyltransferase DOT1L, which methylates histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79). Af9 association with DOT1L enhances methylation of H3K79 at the TBR1 transcription start site, thereby interfering with RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII) activity and reducing TBR1 expression. Mutants of Af9 experience increased dimethylation of H3K79 and increased TBR1 expression.|$|E
