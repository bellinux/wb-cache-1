'After that thou shalt cut it down.' Death, I say, is the axe, which God often useth, therewith to take the barren fig-tree out of the vineyard, out of a profession, and also {{out of the world}} at once. But this axe is now new ground, it cometh well-edged to the roots of this barren fig-tree. It hath been whetted by sin, by the law, and by a formal profession, and therefore must, and will make deep gashes, not only in the natural life, but in the heart and conscience also of this professor: 'The wages of sin is death,' 'the sting of death is sin' (Rom 6:23; 1 Cor 15:56). Wherefore death comes not to this man as he doth to saints, muzzled, or without his sting, but with open mouth, in all his strength; yea, he sends his first-born, which is guilt, to devour his strength, and to bring him to the king of terrors (Job 18:13,14).|$|E

5000|$|When {{deciding}} what feed rate {{to use for}} a certain cutting operation, the calculation is fairly straightforward for single-point cutting tools, {{because all of the}} <b>cutting</b> <b>work</b> is done at one point (done by [...] "one tooth", as it were). With a milling machine or jointer, where multi-tipped/multi-fluted cutting tools are involved, then the desirable feed rate becomes dependent on the number of teeth on the cutter, as well as the desired amount of material per tooth to cut (expressed as chip load). The greater the number of cutting edges, the higher the feed rate permissible: for a cutting edge to work efficiently it must remove sufficient material to cut rather than rub; it also must do its fair share of work.|$|E

50|$|Transport, and {{the railway}} in particular, {{had a huge}} impact on the {{development}} of Thornton Heath. The junction at the Pond was always going to command attention as a development core, due to the level of traffic that passed along the Sussex road. But it was the railway in the eastern district that became the more important catalyst to growth. An act was made in 1837 to drain the Croydon canal and convert the basin into the first proper suburban line from the City. As most of the <b>cutting</b> <b>work</b> was already done, it opened within two years. In 1851, the newly formed London and Brighton railway company planned to link London's West End to this line as part of a new service to the south coast. The most obvious place for a junction with the City's line was about 1 mi respectively to the north of Croydon and to the east of Thornton Heath, where the existing track split into the Brighton line and the Epsom line. The added advantage here was that a connection would form a commuter arc around south London between the West End and City. As a fairly level landscape is required for traction, and to avoid time-consuming and expensive cuttings, viaducts and tunnels, the most direct route was along the valleys of the Wandle and Graveney, via Wandsworth and Streatham, and straight through the eastern district of Thornton Heath.|$|E
40|$|In {{the study}} the authors {{determined}} the mechanical properties of pea stems, in the dynamic test, {{as well as}} the wall thickness of hollow stem (G) and cross-section area (S). The study was conducted on narrow-leaf pea varieties with varied resistance to lodging: Komandor (susceptible to lodging) and Brutus (resistant to lodging). For purposes of result comparison, also an older lodging-resistant variety - Piast - was included in the study. The strength characteristics of pea stems were obtained through determination of <b>cutting</b> <b>work</b> (Ed) and <b>cutting</b> <b>work</b> per unit of stem cross-section area (wd), with the help of Dynstat apparatus. The measurements were taken at five points on the stem height. It was demonstrated that the <b>cutting</b> <b>work</b> reaches the highest value in the middle of stem length, while the work per unit of stem cross-section area is the highest close to the root. The study showed that there is a differentiation of the mechanical properties of pea stems. Varieties resistant to lodging are characterized by much higher values of their mechanical parameters. On the basis of correlation coefficients a significant correlation was found between the <b>cutting</b> <b>work</b> and the stem wall thickness and cross-section surface area. Negative correlation coefficients were obtained for the correlation between the <b>cutting</b> <b>work</b> per unit of stem cross-section area and the geometrical parameters of the stems. On the basis of the <b>cutting</b> <b>work</b> and the <b>cutting</b> <b>work</b> per unit of stem cross-section area intervarietal differences were shown. At the same time, the study in which estimation was made of the absorption of X-ray radiation by stems {{on the basis of the}} parameter DOD, determined with the densitometric method, showed intervarietal differences. Complementary anatomical study, made on the basis of seven traits, showed cross-sections at the analysed heights on the stems of pea varieties, suggesting also the occurrence of intervarietal differences...|$|E

40|$|The present Bachelor {{thesis is}} written about a rock slide {{which took place}} in the {{southern}} part of Stockholm in the early 2000 s. The studied area is located relatively close to a steeply-dipping fault with NW-SE orientation. The field work was carried out by four students, with me and other student focussing on the rock slide slope and two scan lines N and E of the rock slide. The geological structures, which were assumed to be responsible for the rock slide, have been studied carefully during surface mapping. The data was analysed using two rock mass classifications and stereographic projection. Additionally, a digital elevation map of the area was analysed in terms of slope angle distributions using GIS. It was shown that the orientation of discontinuities at the site coincides with the direction of the <b>cutting</b> <b>work.</b> Thus, the rock slide was unavoidable since the <b>cutting</b> <b>work</b> was carried out subparallel to the fractures main orientation. ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{activity}} of effective cutting grains in <b>cutting</b> of <b>work</b> and {{the activity}} of effective cutting grains in generation of finished surface are described. The former was investigated by the measurement of wheel surface temperature immediately after grinding using infrared radiation pyrometer with an optical fiber and the latter was investigated by the measurement of finished surface roughness using three-dimensional surface roughness tracer respectively. These activity of cutting grains in the whole circumference of wheel surface was clarified. The results obtained are as follows: 1) Cutting grains which have effective concern with <b>cutting</b> of <b>work</b> certainly act in every rotation of wheel. 2) The number of effective cutting grains in <b>cutting</b> of <b>work</b> increases as wheel depth of cut increases. 3) Cross-sectional shape of scratch toward grinding direction on the finished surface accurately correspond in the every period of one circumference of wheel {{in the order of}} sub-micrometer. 4) Finished surface is generated by some identical cutting grains even when wheel depth of cut increases...|$|R

40|$|Abs t rac t. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of cooking time on the cooking quality and texture properties of spaghetti made with different raw materials. As a result of extension in the cooking time, an increase was observed in the amount of water absorbed by the products, with a si-multaneous increase in the index of pasta mass gain after cooking. A high significant correlation between weight increase index and moisture of cooked spaghetti was observed (r = 0. 97, p < 0. 0001). The dry matter losses, during 4 - 16 minutes cooking of spaghetti, were positively correlated with the distance for maximum cutting force and with the <b>cutting</b> <b>work.</b> The correlation coefficients were 0. 85 and 0. 51, re-spectively. The highest values of the cutting force and the <b>cutting</b> <b>work</b> characterised pasta cooked in the time immediately preceding the minimum cooking time. The application of cooking times longer than the minimum caused a decrease in the firmness of the pasta but the changes were relatively slight.
