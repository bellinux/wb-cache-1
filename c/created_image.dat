Soon after, she was recruited by the SFA {{to teach in the}} newly <b>created</b> <b>Image</b> and Design Department, also becoming its second director. Together with María de Mater O”Neill, López was responsible for revising and creating the curricula for the new program in 1993. After several years teaching in SFA, she created the publication project Orificio, as a way of getting students and professors to share their artistic and intellectual production. After leaving [...] SFA in 2002, she decided to keep the project going (...) , but this time as an independent art project periodical. After this, López published four more editions. Orificio #6, the last and most recent edition, was commissioned and exhibited in the Independent Publications section of the 2nda.Trienal Poli/gráfica de San Juan: América Latina y el Caribe, celebrated in Puerto Rico in 2009. Some of the artists that collaborated in the different Orificio editions are: Charles Juhasz-Alvarado, Elizam Escobar, Maryanne Hopgood-Santaella, José Luis Vargas, Jose Jorge Román, Julio Suárez, Ana Rosa Rivera Marrero, Joaquín Mercado, Kristine Serviá, Lilliam Nieves, Carmen Olmo-Terrasa, Freddy Mercado, Carlos Fajardo, Adal Maldonado, Ernesto Pujol, Garwin Sierra and Vimarie Serrano.|$|E
2500|$|The larger, {{advanced}} {{digital cameras}} offer a non-optical electronic through-the-lens (TTL) view, via an eye-level electronic viewfinder (EVF) {{in addition to}} the rear LCD. The difference in view compared with a DSLR is that the EVF shows a digitally <b>created</b> <b>image,</b> whereas the viewfinder in a DSLR shows an actual optical image via the reflex viewing system. An EVF image has lag time (that is, it reacts with a delay to view changes) and has a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder but achieves parallax-free viewing using less bulk and mechanical complexity than a DSLR with its reflex viewing system. Optical viewfinders tend to be more comfortable and efficient, especially for action photography and in low-light conditions. Compared with digital cameras with LCD electronic viewfinders, there is no time lag in the image: it is always correct as it is being [...] "updated" [...] at the speed of light. This is important for action or sports photography, or any other situation where the subject or the camera is moving quickly. Furthermore, the [...] "resolution" [...] of the viewed image is much better than that provided by an LCD or an electronic viewfinder, which can be important if manual focusing is desired for precise focusing, as would be the case in macro photography and [...] "micro-photography" [...] (with a microscope). An optical viewfinder may also cause less eye-strain. However, electronic viewfinders may provide a brighter display in low light situations, as the picture can be electronically amplified.|$|E

50|$|Thus, in the Orthodox {{tradition}} sin is not viewed {{primarily as}} a guilty stain on the soul {{that needs to be}} wiped out, but rather as a pervading sickness or a failure to achieve the goal of the truly human life, fulfilling one's Divine design and function as the <b>created</b> <b>image</b> of God. Sin, therefore, does not merely imply guilt for violating a commandment, but rather the impetus to become something other than what we are. Because each person's experience is unique, conquering one's sinful habits requires individual attention and correction. The ultimate goal for this salvific process is to become divinized, to reflect the Divine likeness by becoming Christ-like in one's thought life and behavior.|$|E

It is generally a typical mood for a variety of Yegorov’s marinas, even those that are filled with lightness and ease, although the carefree and weightless atmosphere is not characteristic for the painter’s works. Contrasts, which become visible under the extremely bright and blinding light, as well as the game of light and shade, highlight the density of the deadly water mass.The fundamentally roundish lines of the skyline are also a typical feature of Yegorov’s marinas.|$|E

5000|$|Through theoria (illumination with {{or direct}} {{experience}} of the Triune God), human beings come to know and experience {{what it means to}} be fully human, i.e., the <b>created</b> <b>image</b> of God; through their communion with Jesus Christ, God shares himself with the human race, in order to conform them to all that He is in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness. As God became human, in all ways except sin, he will also make humans [...] "God", i.e., [...] "holy" [...] or [...] "saintly", in all ways except his Divine Essence, which is uncaused and uncreated. St. Irenaeus explained this doctrine in the work Against Heresies, Book 5, Preface: [...] "the Word of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, Who did, through His transcendent love, become what we are, that He might bring us to be even what He is Himself." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{photoresist}} {{is selected}} which is {{resistant to the}} particular acid or other etching compound to be used. It may be a liquid applied by brushing, spraying, pouring or other means and then allowed to set, or it may come in sheet form and be applied by laminating. It is then exposed to light—usually strong ultraviolet (UV) light—through a photographic, mechanically printed, or manually <b>created</b> <b>image</b> or pattern on transparent film. Alternatively, a lens {{may be used to}} project an image directly onto it. Typically, the photoresist is hardened where it receives sufficient exposure to light, but some photoresists are initially hard and are then softened by exposure. A solvent is used to wash away the soft parts, laying bare the underlying material, which is then bathed in or sprayed with the acid or other etchant. The remaining photoresist is usually removed after the operation is complete.|$|E
5000|$|Later works {{gradually}} abandoned illusionism for {{an increased}} emphasis on the artificiality of the picture as <b>created</b> <b>image,</b> divorced from reality. This effect was achieved {{by the use of}} a limited range of colours and the expressive distortion of figures as well as space. [...] Example of works in this later style are the [...] (Groeningemuseum, Bruges) and the [...] (c. 1480, Gemäldegalerie, Berlin). Other characteristics imputed to these later works are a breakdown of space, a renunciation of still-life elements not directly related to the subject matter and an exaggerated agitation and an excess of expression in the figures. Early scholars saw the evolution as a reflection of the increasing mental instability of the artist. Later interpretations gave much weight to the artist's adherence to the Modern Devotion movement as an important influence. These interpretations see the later paintings as attempts by van der Goes to translate the ideas of this movement into a visual medium. In particular the movement's emphasis on meditation is seen as playing {{a key role in the}} artist abandoning illusionism.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas Aquinas {{defined the}} beatific vision {{as the human}} being's [...] "final end" [...] in which one attains to a perfect happiness. Thomas reasons that one is {{perfectly}} happy only when all one's desires are perfectly satisfied, {{to the degree that}} happiness could not increase and could not be lost. [...] "Man is not perfectly happy, so long as something remains for him to desire and seek."STh I-II, q., 3, a. 8. But this kind of perfect happiness cannot be found in any physical pleasure, any amount of worldly power, any degree of temporal fame or honor, or indeed in any finite reality. It can only be found in something that is infinite and perfect - and this is God. STh I-II, q. 2, a. 8. And since God is not a material thing but is pure spirit, we are united to God by knowing and loving him. Consequently, the most perfect union with God is the most perfect human happiness and the goal of the whole of the human life. But we cannot attain to this happiness by our own natural powers; it is a gift that must be given us by God, who strengthens us by the [...] "light of glory" [...] so that we can see him as he is, without any intermediary. (Thomas quotes Psalm 36:9 on this point: [...] "In your light we shall see light.")STh I, q. 12, a. 4. Further, since every <b>created</b> <b>image</b> or likeness of God (including even the most perfect [...] "ideas" [...] or [...] "images" [...] of God we might generate in our minds) is necessarily finite, it would thus be infinitely less than God himself.STh I, q. 12, a. 2. The only perfect and infinite good, therefore, is God himself, which is why Aquinas argues that our perfect happiness and final end can only be the direct union with God himself and not with any <b>created</b> <b>image</b> of him. This union comes about by a kind of [...] "seeing" [...] perfectly the divine essence itself, a gift given to our intellects when God joins them directly to himself without any intermediary. And since in seeing this perfect vision of what (and who) God is, we grasp also his perfect goodness, this act of [...] "seeing" [...] {{is at the same time}} a perfect act of loving God as the highest and infinite goodness.|$|E
