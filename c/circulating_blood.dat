5|$|Given that liver AVMs {{generally}} cause high-output cardiac failure, {{the emphasis}} is on treating this with diuretics to reduce the <b>circulating</b> <b>blood</b> volume, restriction of salt and fluid intake, and antiarrhythmic agents in case of irregular heart beat. This may be sufficient in treating the symptoms of swelling and breathlessness. If this treatment is not effective or leads to side effects or complications, the only remaining option is liver transplantation. This is reserved for those with severe symptoms, as it carries a mortality of about 10%, but leads to good results if successful. The exact point at which liver transplantion is to be offered is not yet completely established. Embolization treatment has been attempted, but leads to severe complications in a proportion of patients and is discouraged.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have known}} about the heart since ancient times, {{although}} its precise function and anatomy were not clearly understood. From the primarily religious views of earlier societies towards the heart, ancient Greeks are considered {{to have been the}} primary seat of scientific understanding of the heart in the ancient world. Aristotle considered the heart to be organ responsible for creating blood; Plato considered the heart as the source of <b>circulating</b> <b>blood</b> and Hippocrates noted blood circulating cyclically from the body through the heart to the lungs. Erasistratos (304–250 BCE) noted the heart as a pump, causing dilation of blood vessels, and noted that arteries and veins both radiate from the heart, becoming progressively smaller with distance, although he believed they were filled with air and not blood. He also discovered the heart valves.|$|E

50|$|Stroma-like theca {{cells are}} {{recruited}} by oocyte-secreted signals. They surround the follicle's outermost layer, the basal lamina, and undergo cytodifferentiation {{to become the}} theca externa and theca interna.

25|$|Class III Hemorrhage {{involves}} loss of 30-40% of <b>circulating</b> <b>blood</b> volume. The patient's {{blood pressure}} drops, {{the heart rate}} increases, peripheral hypoperfusion (shock), such as capillary refill worsens, and the mental status worsens. Fluid resuscitation with crystalloid and blood transfusion are usually necessary.|$|E
25|$|Deficient {{activity}} of this enzyme reduces {{the efficiency of}} cortisol synthesis, with consequent hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex and elevation of ACTH levels. ACTH stimulates uptake of cholesterol and synthesis of pregnenolone. Steroid precursors {{up to and including}} progesterone, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, and especially 17α-hydroxyprogesterone accumulate in the adrenal cortex and in <b>circulating</b> <b>blood.</b> Blood levels of 17OHP can reach 10-1000 times the normal concentration.|$|E

25|$|Bradykinin {{is rapidly}} inactivated in the <b>circulating</b> <b>blood,</b> and it disappears {{completely}} {{in a single}} pass through the pulmonary circulation. Angiotensin I also disappears in the pulmonary circulation because of its conversion to angiotensin II. Furthermore, angiotensin II passes through the lungs without any loss. The inactivation of bradykinin and the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the lungs was thought to be caused by the same enzyme. In 1970, Ng and Vane, using BPF provided by Ferreira, showed the conversion is inhibited during its passage through the pulmonary circulation.|$|E
25|$|One of Roman Vishniac's {{most famous}} endeavors {{in the field}} of photomicroscopy was his revolutionary {{photographs}} from the inside of a firefly's eye, behind 4,600 tiny ommatidia, complexly arranged. In addition, there were the images taken at the medical school of Boston University of the <b>circulating</b> <b>blood</b> inside a hamster's cheek pouch. Vishniac invented new methods for light-interruption photography and color photomicroscopy. His method of colorization, (developed in the 1960s and early 1970s) uses polarized light to penetrate certain formations of cell structure and may greatly improve the detail of an image.|$|E
25|$|Upper {{gastrointestinal}} bleeding is {{gastrointestinal bleeding}} {{in the upper}} gastrointestinal tract, commonly defined as bleeding arising from the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. Blood may be observed in vomit (hematemesis) or in altered form in the stool (melena). Depending on {{the severity of the}} blood loss, there may be symptoms of insufficient <b>circulating</b> <b>blood</b> volume and shock. As a result, upper gastrointestinal bleeding is considered a medical emergency and typically requires hospital care for urgent diagnosis and treatment. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding can be caused by peptic ulcers, gastric erosions, esophageal varices, and some rarer causes such as gastric cancer.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{scientists}} {{working on the}} problem appreciated the need to <b>circulate</b> <b>blood,</b> there was simply no effective means to do so.

The prevailing belief was described in a physician’s quote from 1890, [...] "We are powerless against paralysis of the circulation." ...|$|R
50|$|Impaired diastolic {{function}} {{can result}} from the decreased compliance of the ventricles, which means the heart cannot stretch as much during filling. This {{will result in a}} reduced end diastolic volume (EDV). According to Frank-Starling forces, a reduced EDV will lead to a reduced stroke volume, thus a reduced cardiac output. Over time, this decreased cardiac output will diminish the ability of the heart to <b>circulate</b> <b>blood</b> efficiently throughout the body.|$|R
50|$|The {{muscular system}} is an organ system {{consisting}} of skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscles. It permits {{movement of the}} body, maintains posture, and <b>circulates</b> <b>blood</b> throughout the body. The muscular system in vertebrates is controlled through the nervous system, although some muscles (such as the cardiac muscle) can be completely autonomous. Together with the skeletal system it forms the musculoskeletal system, {{which is responsible for}} movement of the human body.|$|R
25|$|Inflammatory {{responses}} to triggers such as TNF-α involve macrophages with components that include miR-155. miR-155 is overexpressed in atopic dermatitis {{and contributes to}} chronic skin inflammation by increasing the proliferative response of T(H) cells through the downregulation of CTLA-4. In Autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, miR-155 showed higher expression in patients' tissues and synovial fibroblasts. In multiple sclerosis, increased expression of mir-155 has also been measured in peripheral and CNS-resident myeloid cells, including <b>circulating</b> <b>blood</b> monocytes and activated microglia. It was also found that mir-155 is implicated in inflammation. Overexpression of mir-155 will lead to chronic inflammatory state in human.|$|E
25|$|Important {{differences}} exist between integrin-signaling in <b>circulating</b> <b>blood</b> cells and non-circulating cells such as epithelial cells; integrins of circulating cells are normally inactive. For example, cell membrane integrins on circulating leukocytes are maintained in an inactive state to avoid epithelial cell attachment; they are activated only {{in response to}} stimuli such as those received {{at the site of}} an inflammatory response. In a similar manner, integrins at the cell membrane of circulating platelets are normally kept inactive to avoid thrombosis. Epithelial cells (which are non-circulating) normally have active integrins at their cell membrane, helping maintain their stable adhesion to underlying stromal cells that provide signals to maintain normal functioning.|$|E
25|$|The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is {{a highly}} {{selective}} semipermeable membrane barrier that separates the <b>circulating</b> <b>blood</b> from the brain and extracellular fluid in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). The blood–brain barrier is formed by brain endothelial cells and it allows the passage of water, some gases, and lipid-soluble molecules by passive diffusion, as well as the selective transport of molecules such as glucose and amino acids that are crucial to neural function. Furthermore, it prevents the entry of lipophilic potential neurotoxins by way of an active transport mechanism mediated by P-glycoprotein. Astrocytes have been claimed to be necessary to create the blood–brain barrier. A few regions in the brain, including the circumventricular organs, do not have a blood–brain barrier.|$|E

The grant was renewed for a second year of research in August 2009. The Total Artificial Heart was created using two HeartAssist5 VADs, whereby one VAD pumps blood throughout {{the body and the}} other <b>circulates</b> <b>blood</b> to and from the lungs.|$|R

25|$|While {{previous}} thought {{held that}} compounds {{were added to}} the blood from glands in the ocular sinus cavity, current research has shown that the chemical compounds that make up the defense are already in the <b>circulating</b> <b>blood.</b> It is possible that their diet of large quantities of venomous Harvester Ants could be a factor; however, the origin and structure of the chemicals responsible are still unknown. The blood-squirting mechanism increases survival after contact with canine predators; therefore, it is probable that, while unorthodox, the trait could have provided an evolutionary advantage. Ocular autohemorrhaging has also been documented in other lizards, which suggests blood-squirting could have evolved from a less extreme defense in the ancestral branch of the genus. Recent phylogenic research supports this claim, so it appears as though the species incapable of squirting blood have lost the adaptation for reasons yet unstudied.|$|E
25|$|During each heartbeat, blood {{pressure}} varies between a maximum (systolic) and a minimum (diastolic) pressure. The {{blood pressure}} in the circulation is principally due to the pumping action of the heart. Differences in mean blood pressure are responsible for blood flow from one location to another in the circulation. The rate of mean blood flow depends on both blood pressure and the resistance to flow presented by the blood vessels. Mean blood pressure decreases as the <b>circulating</b> <b>blood</b> {{moves away from the}} heart through arteries and capillaries due to viscous losses of energy. Mean blood pressure drops over the whole circulation, although most of the fall occurs along the small arteries and arterioles. Gravity affects blood pressure via hydrostatic forces (e.g., during standing), and valves in veins, breathing, and pumping from contraction of skeletal muscles also influence {{blood pressure in}} veins.|$|E
25|$|A unique {{characteristic}} of the northern elephant seal {{is that it has}} developed the ability to store oxygenated red blood cells within its spleen. In a 2004 study researchers used MRI to observe physiological changes of the spleens of 5 seal pups during simulated dives. By 3 minutes, the spleens on average contracted to a fifth of their original size, indicating a dive-related sympathetic contraction of the spleen. Also, a delay was observed between contraction of the spleen and increased hematocrit within the <b>circulating</b> <b>blood,</b> and attributed to the hepatic sinus. This fluid-filled structure is initially expanded due to the rush of RBC from the spleen and slowly releases the red blood cells into the circulatory system via a muscular vena caval sphincter found on the cranial aspect of the diaphragm. This ability to slowly introduce RBC into the blood stream is likely to prevent any harmful effects caused by a rapid increase in hematocrit.|$|E
50|$|Peristaltic {{pumps are}} {{typically}} used to pump clean/sterile or aggressive fluids without exposing those fluids to contamination from exposed pump components. Some common applications include pumping IV fluids through an infusion device, apheresis, aggressive chemicals, high solids slurries {{and other materials}} where isolation of the product from the environment, and the environment from the product, are critical. It is also used in heart-lung machines to <b>circulate</b> <b>blood</b> during a bypass surgery as the pump does not cause significant hemolysis.|$|R

500|$|Thrombosis is a multifactorial {{problem because}} there are often {{multiple}} reasons why a person might develop thrombosis. These risk factors may include any combination of abnormalities in the blood vessel wall, abnormalities in the blood flow (as in immobilization), and abnormalities in {{the consistency of the}} blood. Thrombophilia is caused by abnormalities in blood consistency, which is determined by the levels of coagulation factors and other <b>circulating</b> <b>blood</b> proteins that participate in the [...] "coagulation cascade".|$|E
500|$|On {{physical}} examination {{there is usually}} clinical evidence of dehydration, such as a dry mouth and decreased skin turgor.

50|$|Diabetic {{cardiomyopathy}} is {{a disorder}} {{of the heart}} muscle in people with diabetes.

50|$|In each {{of these}} two types of {{shockable}} cardiac arrhythmia, the heart is electrically active, but in a dysfunctional pattern that does not allow it to pump and <b>circulate</b> <b>blood.</b> In ventricular tachycardia, the heart beats too fast to effectively pump blood. Ultimately, ventricular tachycardia leads to ventricular fibrillation. In ventricular fibrillation, the electrical activity of the heart becomes chaotic, preventing the ventricle from effectively pumping blood. The fibrillation in the heart decreases over time, and will eventually reach asystole.|$|R
