50|$|The primary {{advantages}} of a super-channel approach are increased spectral efficiency (a consequence of both <b>coherent</b> <b>detection</b> {{and the possibility of}} tight spectral packing of the subcarriers making up a super-channel), and operational scalability (the ability to bring larger units of long haul optical capacity into service for a given operational effort).|$|E
30|$|We {{especially}} varied stimulus parameters in the <b>coherent</b> motion <b>detection</b> {{experiment in}} order to assess if the seal’s performance would increase with experience. Note that learning can only explain the improvement of the seal’s performance documented between but not within experiments as in phase 1 and 2 of the <b>coherent</b> motion <b>detection</b> experiment the stimulus parameter under examination were varied over sessions instead of successively. Indeed, the seal’s thresholds decreased over the whole <b>coherent</b> motion <b>detection</b> experiment. It remains to be answered if this amelioration was due to an optimization of stimulus parameters, reflects a stabilization of performance with time and thus experience as has already been documented for e. g. mice (Douglas et al. 2006) and monkeys (Britten et al. 1992) or reflects a learning effect. Over time, the seal might have learnt {{to pay attention to the}} differential flickering of the positive stimulus in the <b>coherent</b> motion <b>detection</b> experiment and/or to local motion events. The latter is supported by the results of phase 1 of the <b>coherent</b> motion <b>detection</b> experiment demonstrating an improvement of performance the longer the dot lifetime.|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{an automatic}} target recognition (ATR) algorithm for {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) imagery {{that is based on}} <b>coherent</b> change <b>detection</b> techniques. The algorithm relies on templates created from training data to identify targets. Objects are identified or rejected as targets by comparing their SAR signatures with templates using the same complex correlation scheme developed for <b>coherent</b> change <b>detection.</b> Preliminary results are presented in addition to future recommendations...|$|R
40|$|<b>Coherent</b> change <b>detection</b> between {{multiple}} {{synthetic aperture}} sonar (SAS) images is reliant on the images being co-registered with sub-pixel accuracy. In this paper we suggest a technique using available navigation data {{to reconstruct the}} images onto a common grid. Data obtained using the MUD SAS system is used to demonstrate this method. We show that even with high quality navigation data {{there is still a}} misregistration which causes a loss of coherence. Additional data-driven alignment is required in order to use the images for <b>coherent</b> change <b>detection.</b> © 2013 IEEE...|$|R
5000|$|Detector, {{with the}} {{relatively}} low levels of available power, {{in the order of}} 1 µW, a sensitive detector is required to ensure a reasonable signal to noise ratio. Si bolometers provide a solution for in-coherent instruments. Alternatively a second photomixer device {{can be used as a}} detector and has the advantage of allowing <b>coherent</b> <b>detection.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Coherent Technology used on {{the system}} mainly consist of four major elements: high order amplitude/phase modulation, {{polarization}} multiplexing, <b>coherent</b> <b>detection</b> using a local oscillator laser in the receiver, and high-speed ADCs and sophisticated digital signal processing in the receiver, 100G Coherent Technology can overcome various fiber impairments, such as chromatic dispersion (CD) and polarization mode dispersion (PMD).|$|E
5000|$|In general {{there are}} two kinds of lidar {{detection}} schemes: [...] "incoherent" [...] or direct energy detection (which principally measures amplitude changes of the reflected light) and <b>coherent</b> <b>detection</b> (which is best for measuring Doppler shifts, or changes in phase of the reflected light). Coherent systems generally use optical heterodyne detection, which, being more sensitive than direct detection, allows them to operate at a much lower power but at the expense of more complex transceiver requirements.|$|E
50|$|Conversely, if the Doppler spread {{is large}} while the delay spread is small, then a shorter symbol period may permit <b>coherent</b> tone <b>detection</b> and the tones must be spaced more widely to {{maintain}} orthogonality.|$|R
25|$|Hyperspectral imaging {{can detect}} {{disturbed}} earth and foliage. In concert with other {{methods such as}} <b>coherent</b> change <b>detection</b> radar, which can precisely measure changes in {{the height of the}} ground surface. Together, these can detect underground construction.|$|R
40|$|The {{emission}} of a quantum cascade laser can be synchronized to the repetition rate of a femtosecond laser {{through the use}} of coherent injection seeding. This synchronization defines a sampling coherence between the terahertz laser emission and the femtosecond laser which enables <b>coherent</b> field <b>detection.</b> In this letter the sampling coherence is measured in the time-domain {{through the use of}} <b>coherent</b> and incoherent <b>detection.</b> For large seed amplitudes the emission is synchronized, while for small seed amplitudes the emission is non-synchronized. For intermediate seed amplitudes the emission exhibits a partial sampling coherence that is time-dependent...|$|R
50|$|Like other M-ary {{orthogonal}} schemes, {{the required}} Eb/N0 ratiofor a given {{probability of error}} decreases as M increases {{without the need for}} multisymbol <b>coherent</b> <b>detection.</b> In fact, as M approaches infinity the required Eb/N0 ratio decreases asymptotically to the Shannon limit of -1.6 dB. However this decrease is slow with increasing M, and large values are impractical because of the exponential increase in required bandwidth. Typical values in practice range from 4 to 64, and MFSK is combined with another forward error correction scheme to provide additional (systematic) coding gain.|$|E
5000|$|The core of {{both the}} SAR and the phased array {{techniques}} is that the distances that radar waves travel to and back from each scene element consist of some integer number of wavelengths plus some fraction of a [...] "final" [...] wavelength. Those fractions cause differences between the phases of the re-radiation received at various SAR or array positions. <b>Coherent</b> <b>detection</b> is needed to capture the signal phase information {{in addition to the}} signal amplitude information. That type of detection requires finding the differences between the phases of the received signals and the simultaneous phase of a well-preserved sample of the transmitted illumination.|$|E
50|$|The most {{challenging}} case {{is when the}} delay and Doppler spreads are both large, i.e., the coherence bandwidth and coherence time are both small. This is more common on auroral and EME channels than on HF, but it can occur. A short coherence time limits the symbol time, or more precisely, the maximum <b>coherent</b> <b>detection</b> interval at the receiver. If the symbol energy is too small for an adequate per-symbol detection SNR, then one alternative is transmit a symbol longer than the coherence time but to detect it with a filter muchwider than one matched to the transmitted symbol. (The filter should instead be matched to the tone spectrum expected at the receiver). This will capture much of the symbol energy despite Doppler spreading, but it will necessarily do so inefficiently. A wider tone spacing, i.e., a wider channel, is also required. Forward error correction is especially helpful in this case.|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{indicated}} a key role for dorsal stream processing in lexical decoding. To examine this relationship further, performance on orthographic and phonological reading tests was compared with both steady-state visual evoked potentials and a putative behavioral measure of dorsal stream processing, <b>coherent</b> motion <b>detection.</b> Frequency analysis of the visual evoked potential data showed power at the second harmonic to be largely confined to dorsal stream regions, and significantly correlated with motion detection thresholds. Regression analyses showed that orthographic processing {{was significantly associated with}} the second harmonic power. Although consistent with previous reports, there remains a question as to why the orthographic visual evoked potential power relationship did not extend to include the <b>coherent</b> motion <b>detection</b> measures...|$|R
30|$|Flickering as a {{secondary}} cue was eliminated {{in the last}} two experiments, in which the seal was asked to assess the direction of coherent motion, because the flicker was present at both sides of the stimulus and thus should not have provided any information about the motion direction of the signal dots. The seal could directly transfer its experience from <b>coherent</b> motion <b>detection</b> to a discrimination of coherent motion direction within one session. This contradicts the hypothesis that differential flickering had been crucial for decision. However, the resulting threshold is worse than the final thresholds of the <b>coherent</b> motion <b>detection</b> experiment, which could be explained by the absence of flickering, if it had guided the seal’s responses to some extent in the previous experiments. Alternatively, the threshold might be worse in the coherent motion direction discrimination experiment using random direction noise as compared to the best thresholds in the <b>coherent</b> motion <b>detection</b> experiment as the seal had to cope with a totally new experimental situation including a different experimental procedure and direction of stimulus movement. There is evidence from other studies (Britten et al. 1992) that threshold performance does not necessarily transfer to new experimental conditions.|$|R
30|$|During experiments, six {{levels of}} {{stimulus}} intensity {{were presented in}} each session chosen to span the prospective threshold range. The experimental animal was presented with more stimuli above the putative threshold than below in order to assure a high motivation level. The position of the positive stimulus was changed {{from left to right}} (<b>coherent</b> motion <b>detection</b> experiment) or the direction of motion was varied between rightward and leftward stimulus motion (coherent motion direction discrimination experiments) in pseudorandom order after Gellermann (Gellermann 1933). In each session, the positive stimulus occurred equally often on the right {{as well as on the}} left side (<b>coherent</b> motion <b>detection</b> experiments), rightward and leftward stimulus motion was equally often presented (coherent motion direction discrimination experiments). In the <b>coherent</b> motion <b>detection</b> experiment, in which in one phase dot lifetime and in another phase dot density was varied, dot lifetime and dot density was constant for a session but was varied according to a predetermined schedule over sessions in order to assure that motivation changes of our subjects or training dependent shifts in performance affected all stimulus levels tested in that dimension in similar ways.|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} for combining equalization and differentially <b>coherent</b> <b>detection</b> is proposed {{for use in}} wireless communication when carrier phase recovery is difficult. A decision-feedback differentially coherent scheme, which generates an improved reference phase, is combined with a linear equalizer and the LMS algorithm is used to adapt the equalizer to an unknown channel. In addition, the proposed receiver is simulated for various two-dimensional signal constellations over multipath channels. It is shown that for high SNR, the degradation of this structure is negligible with respect to combined <b>coherent</b> <b>detection</b> and equalization. Therefore, this equalized differentially <b>coherent</b> <b>detection</b> scheme can be used when carrier phase tracking (i. e. <b>coherent</b> <b>detection)</b> is difficult and intersymbol interference is a major obstacle...|$|E
40|$|<b>Coherent</b> <b>detection</b> {{which has}} the best {{performance}} in ideal channels suffers in environments where there is significant phase noise (e. g. fading channels). In this thesis, we developed channel models for noisy phase reference and Rician fading channels and assuming that partially <b>coherent</b> <b>detection</b> could be an alternative, we derived metric expressions for partially <b>coherent</b> <b>detection</b> of signals in general and applied it to PSK signals. Simulation programs were run using the developed channel models {{and the results were}} compared to other detection schemes under same conditions...|$|E
40|$|Closed-form {{expressions}} of {{bit error rate}} (BER) are derived for space-time block codes (STBC) based on Alam-outi’s scheme and utilizing M-ary phase shift keying (MPSK) modulation. The analysis is carried out for the slow, flat Rayleigh fading channel with <b>coherent</b> <b>detection</b> and with non-coherent differential encoding/decoding. The BER expression for <b>coherent</b> <b>detection</b> is exact, while for differential detection it is an approximation for high signal to noise ratio.

40|$|AbstractVisual motion {{processing}} {{in typical}} and atypical readers has suggested aspects {{of reading and}} motion processing share a common cortical network rooted in dorsal visual areas. Few {{studies have examined the}} relationship between reading performance and visual form processing, which is mediated by ventral cortical areas. We investigated whether reading fluency correlates with <b>coherent</b> motion <b>detection</b> thresholds in typically developing children using random dot kinematograms. As a comparison, we also evaluated the correlation between reading fluency and static form detection thresholds. Results show that both dorsal and ventral visual functions correlated with components of reading fluency, but that they have different developmental characteristics. Motion coherence thresholds correlated with reading rate and accuracy, which both improved with chronological age. Interestingly, when controlling for non-verbal abilities and age, reading accuracy significantly correlated with thresholds for <b>coherent</b> form <b>detection</b> but not <b>coherent</b> motion <b>detection</b> in typically developing children. Dorsal visual functions that mediate motion coherence seem to be related maturation of broad cognitive functions including non-verbal abilities and reading fluency. However, ventral visual functions that mediate form coherence seem to be specifically related to accurate reading in typically developing children...|$|R
30|$|A {{systematic}} variation of dot density in phase 2 of the <b>coherent</b> motion <b>detection</b> experiment {{led to an}} increase in performance of the seal with increasing dot density. This result is in line with previous studies reporting that e. g. global direction discrimination improved as the amount of direction information is increased e. g. by increasing dot density (Watamaniuk 1993). In phase 2 of the <b>coherent</b> motion <b>detection</b> experiment, the seal even achieved a very low threshold of 4.7 % coherence. His coherence thresholds did not further improve, when dot density was increased from 500 dots to 1000 dots per stimulus area, which probably indicates that the seal had reached his personal best performance at least under the respective experimental conditions.|$|R

40|$|FSK {{is widely}} used for the {{transmission}} of data over passband channels due to the simplicity of implementation using noncoherent detection schemes. Better BER performance can achieved with accurate phase synchronization using <b>coherent</b> <b>detection</b> scheme. By using the fast Fourier transform (FlT), {{it is possible to}} implement spectrum based detection : complex sinusoid and complex square wave. The BER performance is slightly lower than <b>coherent</b> <b>detection.</b> Unlike <b>coherent</b> <b>detection,</b> phase synchronization is not critical for the spectrum based detection.

40|$|Proposed {{method of}} {{reception}} of multiple-phase-shift-keyed (MPSK) radio signals involves multiple-symbol, partially <b>coherent</b> <b>detection.</b> Instead {{of attempting to}} determine phase of transmitted signal during each symbol period as in <b>coherent</b> <b>detection,</b> receiver acquires signal data during multiple-symbol observation interval, then produces maximum-likelihood-sequence estimate of phases transmitted during interval.

This laser has undergone modification and characterization for inherent performance capabilities {{as a model}} of <b>coherent</b> <b>detection.</b> While characterization results show good overall performance that is in agreement with theoretical predictions, frequency-stability and pulse-length limitations severely limit the laser's use in <b>coherent</b> <b>detection...</b>|$|E
30|$|For {{the first}} {{coherent}} motion direction discrimination experiment, {{we used the}} same principal design of motion signal and noise as in the <b>coherent</b> motion <b>detection</b> experiment, however, we eliminated flicker as a secondary cue. In the <b>coherent</b> motion <b>detection</b> experiment, the subject might have not discriminated the stimuli using the pattern of motion signals the stimuli contained but by the pattern of flicker {{at the edges of}} the stimulus areas. Since in the positive stimulus of the <b>coherent</b> motion <b>detection</b> experiment the <b>coherent</b> dots left the stimulus area at the top edge and were reintroduced at the bottom edge, the pattern of flicker created by the disappearing and reappearing dots differed between the two stimuli with the amount of flicker in the positive stimulus being higher at the bottom/top edges than at the left/right edges. To eliminate flicker the test situation was changed such that there was only one stimulus area of 6, 400  deg 2 (80  deg × 80  deg) size and the direction of the coherently moving dots was horizontal, either left- or rightwards. Under these conditions, the direction of the coherent motion signal was the only cue for the subjects to rely on, since the pattern of flicker was identical under both stimulus conditions.|$|R
40|$|This report investigates {{techniques}} for detecting fine scale scene changes using repeat pass Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. As SAR is a coherent imaging system {{two forms of}} change detection may be considered, namely incoherent and <b>coherent</b> change <b>detection.</b> Incoherent change detec-tion identifies changes in the mean backscatter power of a scene typically via an average intensity ratio change statistic. <b>Coherent</b> change <b>detection</b> on the other hand, identifies changes in both the amplitude and phase of the trans-duced imagery using the sample coherence change statistic. <b>Coherent</b> change <b>detection</b> thus {{has the potential to}} detect very subtle scene changes to the sub-resolution cell scattering structure that may be undetectable using inco-herent techniques. The repeat pass SAR imagery however, must be acquired and processed interferometrically. This report examines the processing steps required to form a coherent image pair and describes an interferometric spot-light SAR processor for processing repeat pass collections acquired with DSTO Ingara X-band SAR. The detection performance of the commonly used average intensity ratio and sample coherence change statistics are provided as well as the performance of a recently proposed log likelihood change statistic. The three change statistics are applied to experimental repeat pass SAR data to demonstrate the relative performance of the change statistics...|$|R
30|$|We {{develop a}} method for the {{automated}} detection and tracking of elephants in wildlife video. The method does not make any assumptions about {{the environment and the}} recording setting. In a first step we learn a color model of the elephants from a small set of annotated training images. Learning the model does not include domain knowledge and explicitly specified constraints about elephants and their environment. The trained model is applied to individual frames of wildlife video sequences to identify candidate detections. Next, we track the candidate detections over time and join temporally <b>coherent</b> <b>detections</b> in consecutive frames. As a result we obtain spatiotemporally consistent detections which provide additional (stronger) clues for the detection of elephants. At the same time we obtain all information necessary to track the elephants in space and time.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of <b>coherent</b> <b>detection</b> to indoor optical free-space communications is considered here. Analytical expressions are derived {{for a wide}} line-of-sight (W-LOS) optical link which determine the coverage area and the required photo-detection area given different binary digital transmission schemes and a given bit rate. The coverage area is maximised for systems using both metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) and PIN photo-detectors. Results show that MSM photo-detectors, due to their inherently lower capacitance per unit photo-detection area, result in a greater coverage area than their PIN counterparts.

This report describes the development of the folded compact range configuration, as well as the initial set of <b>coherent</b> change <b>detection</b> measurements made with the system. These measurements have been highly successful, and have demonstrated the viability of the folded compact range concept in simulating SAR CCD measurements.

40|$|Differential {{distributed}} space-time coding (D-DSTC) {{technique has}} been considered for relay networks to provide both diversity gain and high throughput {{in the absence of}} channel state information. Conventional differential detection (CDD) or two-symbol non-coherent detection over slow -fading channels has been examined and shown to suffer 3 - 4 dB loss when compared to <b>coherent</b> <b>detections.</b> Moreover, it has also been shown that the performance of CDD severely degrades in fast-fading channels and an irreducible error floor exists at high signal-to-noise ratio region. To overcome the error floor experienced with fast-fading, a nearly optimal "multiple-symbol" differential detection (MSDD) is developed in this paper. The MSDD algorithm jointly processes a larger window of received signals for detection and significantly improves the performance of D-DSTC in fast-fading channels. The error performance of the MSDD algorithm is illustrated with simulation results under different fading scenarios...|$|R
