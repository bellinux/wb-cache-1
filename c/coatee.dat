25|$|The 1st {{regiment}} {{was divided}} into the Old Guard and Young Guard squadrons, with the first two wearing a uniform of the hussars, also sometimes known as Hussards Éclaireurs, and the others wearing a <b>coatee</b> similar to the Chasseurs a Cheval.|$|E
25|$|The Governor-General is {{entitled}} to a special court uniform, consisting of a dark navy wool double-breasted <b>coatee</b> with silver oak leaf and fern embroidery on the collar and cuffs trimmed with silver buttons embossed with the Royal Arms and with bullion edged epaulettes on the shoulders, dark navy trousers with a wide band of silver oak-leaf braid down the outside seam, silver sword belt with ceremonial sword, bicorne cocked hat with plume of ostrich feathers, black patent leather Wellington boots with spurs, etc., that is worn on ceremonial occasions. There is also a tropical version made of white tropical wool cut in a typical military fashion worn with a plumed helmet.|$|E
25|$|Officers were {{responsible}} for providing (and paying for) their own uniforms. Consequently, variable styles and decorations were present, according to the officer's private means. Officers in the Infantry wore scarlet coattees with long tails fastened with turnbacks. Close-fitting white pantaloons, tucked into tall Hessian or riding boots were worn, often covered with grey wool and leather overalls on campaign, {{in addition to a}} dark blue, later grey, double-breasted greatcoat. After 1811, officers were permitted to wear a short tailed <b>coatee,</b> grey pantaloons or trousers and low field boots on campaign. Officers generally wore silver or gold epaulettes (depending on regimental colours), with regimental badge to designate rank. An 1810 order stipulated that subalterns wore one epaulette, on the right shoulder, while captains wore one of a more ornate pattern on the right shoulder. Field officers wore one on each shoulder, badged with a star (for majors), a crown (lieutenant colonels) or star and crown (colonels). Grenadier, fusilier and light infantry officers wore more ornate versions of the shoulder wings their men wore on both shoulders; trimmed with lace, chain or bullion. Generals, from 1812, wore an aiguillette over the right shoulder, and rank was denoted by the spacing of buttons on the coatee: Major generals wore their buttons in pairs, lieutenant generals in threes and full generals wore their buttons singly spaced.|$|E

50|$|For Privy Counsellors, on both levée {{and full}} dress <b>coatees</b> the {{embroidery}} had a purl edging; the cocked hat {{was similar to}} that of the 1st class, but with additional hangers on the gold tassels.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{might leave}} our <b>coatees</b> behind us, and go only in our shirts and breeches; and give {{out that we}} had been attacked, and robbed of our money and coats by footpads," [...] Desmond said.|$|R
500|$|Infantry {{units in}} 1809 {{wore a black}} polrock or [...] "Polish coat", a type of frock coat derived from a Lithuanian garment called a litewka which had six pairs of black lace {{fastenings}} down the front. A tall collar showed the regimental colour. Trousers were black with a blue stripe; footwear was black shoes with buttoned gaiters. They wore a shako on their heads, with the skull or a hunting horn badge for light infantry, also a black feather or horsehair plume. The shako, backpack and other equipment were of Austrian design and manufacture. The Sharpshooter companies wore a dark green Prussian-style <b>coatee</b> and a tall hat of Austrian origin with an elongated brim turned-up at one side. In the Peninsular War, the polrock {{was replaced by a}} short black koller or cavalry-style tunic. Equipment and badges of rank were of British pattern.|$|E
500|$|Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana, died at Badajoz on 23 January 1811 {{in a fit}} of apoplexy, seized at {{the moment}} when he was leaving his house to concert a plan of {{military}} operations with Lord Wellington. In the Siege of Badajoz, a detachment of the 45th Regiment of Foot (later amalgamated with the 95th to form the Sherwood Foresters Regiment) succeeded in getting into the castle first and the red <b>coatee</b> of Lt. James MacPherson of the 45th regiment was hoisted in place of the French flag to indicate the fall of the castle. This feat is commemorated on 6 April each year, when red jackets are flown on regimental flag staffs and at Nottingham Castle. Volume 23 of the Museum of Foreign Literature, Science and Art, published in 1833, described Badajoz as [...] "one of the richest and most beautiful towns in the south of Spain, whose inhabitants had witnessed its siege in silent terror for one and twenty days, and who had been shocked by the frightful massacre." [...] On 5 August 1883 there was an attempted revolt by the armed forces when a climate of confusion and chaos prevailed.|$|E
2500|$|Black, {{or other}} solid colour, {{barathea}} jacket with silver buttons — Regulation Doublet, Prince Charlie (<b>coatee),</b> Brian Boru, Braemar, and black mess jackets are suitable. There is some contention {{about whether the}} Duke of Montrose and Sheriffmuir doublets are too formal for black-tie occasions. The Argyll jacket is a popular alternative choice; however, it should be worn with a three button waistcoat rather than the five button vest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. I don't {{think that}} it will make any difference, for the rope is strong enough to hold the three of us together. However, here goes. We may as well leave our <b>coatees</b> behind us. They might get us into difficulties, if we took them." ...|$|R
5000|$|Before 1970, the 180 Pontifical Gendarmes wore {{elaborate}} ceremonial uniforms of 19th-century origin. These included bearskin headdresses {{with red}} plumes, black <b>coatees</b> with white-fringed epaulettes, white doeskin breeches and knee-high riding boots. In service dress bicornes and blue trousers were substituted. [...] The present-day Vatican City gendarmes wear dark blue modern police uniforms.|$|R
50|$|Most {{infantry}} wore scarlet <b>coatees</b> or tailless jackets, with greatcoats {{for cold}} weather. White cotton dress {{was used for}} summer wear in hot climates, particularly in India. The highland regiments wore elements of traditional Scottish highland dress, such as the kilt. The Rifle regiments (the King's Royal Rifle Corps and the Rifle Brigade) wore dark green (almost black) uniforms.|$|R
2500|$|Just as cadets did nearly 200 years ago, today's cadets give up such comforts as beds, instead lying upon cots colloquially {{referred}} to as [...] "hays". These hays {{are little more than}} foam mats that must be rolled every morning and aired every Monday. Further, cadet uniforms have changed little; the <b>coatee</b> worn in parades dates to the War of 1812. [...] New cadets, known as [...] "Rats", experience even further deprivations; for example, they are not permitted to watch TV, listen to music, or use the telephone unsupervised.|$|E

6000|$|... "The man and {{his wife}} {{expressed}} such sympathy that I did not hesitate to say: 'I {{want to get rid of}} my <b>coatee,</b> and of this cloak. The <b>coatee</b> would be of no use to you, and you had best burn it, but the cloak, if you alter it, might be useful; or, if you cut it up, will make a cover for your bed. I will give you that and a gold piece--it is a French one I got in the wars, but you can change it easily enough, when you go into the town marketing--if you will give me a suit of your clothes.' ...|$|E
5000|$|There {{was only}} one major deficiency; Scott {{had been unable to}} obtain enough {{regulation}} blue uniforms for his men. Although they had been manufactured and sent to the northern theater, they had been diverted to Plattsburgh and Sackets Harbor. The United States Army's Commissary General, Callender Irvine, hastily ordered 2,000 uniforms to be made and despatched to Buffalo for Scott's other units, but because there was insufficient blue cloth, short jackets (roundabouts) of grey cloth were used instead. When Scott received the grey roundabouts, he gathered up the blue <b>coatees</b> belonging to his brigade and gave them to the 21st US Infantry (one of the units in Brigadier General Eleazer Wheelock Ripley's brigade), because [...] "the black <b>coatees</b> of the 21st are a disgrace to the uniform and soldier of the army of the United States" [...] (G.O. 16, Winfield Scott, May 24, 1814).|$|R
50|$|The shell {{jacket was}} first {{introduced}} to European armies {{toward the end of}} the 18th Century. Up to then, soldiers, infantry, cavalry and artillery had worn open dress uniform coats with turn-back lapels over either coloured or white sleeved-waistcoats and breeches. The advent of closed uniform <b>coatees,</b> i.e. waist- length jackets with standing collars and tails, buttoned from throat to waist, meant that sleeved waistcoats could not be worn underneath and therefore fell redundant. However, in order to save damage or staining to dress <b>coatees</b> while on fatigue duties, etc., a new, relatively plain coloured waist-length jacket was introduced. The term “shell” jacket is of British origin, appearing during the 1790s, when Light Dragoons adopted a dark blue short jacket with a decorative sleeveless over- jacket, or “shell” on top. Though short-lived, the name stuck and was later to be applied to short, sleeved fatigue jackets from about 1800. Through the British Army adopted coloured shell jackets (red for infantry and heavy cavalry, dark blue for artillery and light cavalry), Foot-Guards and Highland regiments adopted a white shell-jacket, referred to as a sleeved-waistcoat. During the first half of the 19th Century, the British Army wore dress <b>coatees</b> in battle against European or American enemies, but tended to wear shell jackets on colonial campaigns. However, the shell jacket was discontinued by the British in the 1870s (other than by certain cavalry regiments) in favour of a second, plainer skirted tunic. Guards and Highland regiments continued to wear white shell jackets for “walking out” until 1914.|$|R
50|$|The {{class and}} {{category}} of the dress was indicated by the width of gold oak-leaf embroidery on the coatee: 1st class had 5 in, 2nd class had 4 in, 3rd class had 3 in, 4th class 2 in, and 5th class 3/8 in each for full and levée dress gold lace. On both levée and full dress <b>coatees</b> the embroidery had a wavy edging for 1st class, and saw edge for lower classes.|$|R
6000|$|... "And hardly that," [...] Terence laughed, [...] "for the {{adjutant}} {{was down}} upon you pretty sharply; your <b>coatee</b> was all buttoned up wrong; your hair {{had not been}} brushed, and stuck up all ways below your shako; your sword-belt was all awry, and you looked worse than you did when I brought you home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before {{he could}} recover, I had {{stripped}} off his <b>coatee</b> and cloak; then I tied {{his hands and}} feet, fastened the gag firmly in his mouth, and dragged him in between two huts, where {{he would not be}} found till morning. Then I took off my own coat and threw it over him, for the night was chilly, and put on his cloak and shako, and took his place.|$|E
60|$|He {{then opened}} his <b>coatee,</b> took {{out some of}} the white wool with which it was padded, formed this into a loose ball, in the centre of which the note was fastened, and all being in readiness, waited patiently, until, just as the city clock struck ten, they heard a low whistle. The ball had already been {{attached}} {{to the end of the}} thread, and Desmond at once lowered it down.|$|E
50|$|The {{painting}} has {{a highly}} finished surface, reflecting Thompson's academic training, but she eschewed the traditional pyramidal composition of history paintings focusing on one prominent individual, such as Benjamin West's The Death of General Wolfe or John Singleton Copley's The Death of Major Pierson, {{in favour of}} a more democratic linear arrangement, emphasising the common soldier. The coldness of the winter is evoked by the dominant tones of black, grey, white and brown, contrasting with small splashes of red from <b>coatees</b> and flags. It measures 93.3 xx 183.5 cm.|$|R
50|$|Red coats {{were first}} worn by British sea-going regiments when adopted by The Prince of Denmark's Regiment in 1686. Thereafter red <b>coatees</b> became the normal parade and battle dress for marine infantry, {{although}} the staining effects of salt spray meant that white fatigue jackets and subsequently blue undress tunics were often substituted for shipboard duties. The Royal Marine Artillery wore dark blue from their creation in 1804. The scarlet full-dress tunics of the Royal Marine Light Infantry were abolished in 1923 {{when the two}} branches of the Corps were amalgamated and dark blue became the universal uniform colour for both ceremonial and ordinary occasions.|$|R
50|$|During the 18th century {{a series}} of revised dress {{regulations}} made for repeated changes in the facing colours of individual infantry regiments. The Swiss and Irish mercenary regiments retained their red coats throughout this period, while other foreign units generally wore medium blue. Cavalry wore a variety of green, blue or red regimental uniforms, largely according to the whim of individual colonels. The regiments of the Royal Household were similarly variegated, although dark blue dominated. The change from the white or off-white uniforms, traditionally associated with the line infantry of the royal army, to dark blue was completed in 1793 after {{the overthrow of the}} monarchy. White uniforms were restored after the Bourbon Restoration, although modified for a more modern appearance, introducing trousers rather than breeches, taller shakos, and Fleur-de-lis insignia. Dark blue <b>coatees</b> were adopted in 1819.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's glad I am {{to be on}} {{the move}} again, Captain Kennedy," [...] the soldier said, as they rode away. [...] "Sure, your honour, idleness is not good for a man, {{especially}} when he has lashings of the best of food and drink. When I came to buckle on my sword belt, this morning, I found it would not meet within three inches, and the <b>coatee</b> is so tight that I feel as if I was suffocated." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{tore off}} {{the portion of}} the bill on which the message was written, twisted off two of the buttons of his <b>coatee,</b> folded them in the paper, and took his place at the window again. The man who had been {{watching}} was standing some sixty feet from the foot of the wall. His back was towards them. Presently he turned, carelessly looked up at the window, and then, as if undecided what to do, took off his cap and scratched his head.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} tell me about it, Terence. I was expecting it. Didn't I spake to ye the day before about it, and didn't I feel sure that {{something}} would come of it? When that row began last night, I looked at you hard and saw you wink at that young spalpeen, Dicky Ryan; and sure {{all the time that}} we were standing there, formed up, I well-nigh burst the buttons off me <b>coatee</b> in holding in me laughter, when everyone else was full of excitement.|$|E
6000|$|When {{you have}} ceased looking--even staring--at the {{black women and}} their ways, you {{become aware of the}} strange variety of races which people the city. Here passes an old Coolie Hindoo, with nothing on but his lungee round his loins, and a scarf over his head; a white- bearded, delicate-featured old gentleman, with {{probably}} some caste- mark of red paint on his forehead; his thin limbs, and small hands and feet, contrasting strangely with the brawny Negroes round. [...] There comes a bright-eyed young lady, probably his daughter-in-law, hung all over with bangles, in a white muslin petticoat, crimson cotton-velvet jacket, and green gauze veil, with her naked brown baby astride on her hip: a clever, smiling, delicate little woman, who is quite aware of the brightness of her own eyes. And who are these three boys in dark blue <b>coatees</b> and trousers, one of whom carries, hanging at one end of a long bamboo, a couple of sweet potatoes; at the other, possibly, a pebble to balance them? As they approach, their doleful visage betrays them. Chinese they are, without a doubt: but whether old or young, men or women, you cannot tell, till the initiated point out that the women have chignons and no hats, the men hats with their pigtails coiled up under them. [...] Beyond this distinction, I know none visible. Certainly none in those sad visages--'Offas, non facies,' as old Ammianus Marcellinus has it.|$|R
60|$|As {{the last}} thought passed through his brain, Bracebridge's little mustang slouched past the window, ridden (without a saddle) by a {{horseman}} whom {{there was no}} mistaking for no one but the immaculate colonel, the chevalier sans peur et sans reproche, dared to go about the country 'such a figure.' A minute afterwards he walked in, in a student's felt hat, a ragged heather-coloured <b>coatee,</b> and old white 'regulation drills,' shrunk half-way up his legs, a pair of embroidered Indian mocassins, and an enormous meerschaum at his button-hole.|$|E
60|$|Even in that dreadful {{hour the}} seaman's {{faith in his}} {{physical}} invincibility, and in the terrible power of his fists, did not altogether fail. Although he wore a cutlass, and had used it that day with tremendous effect, he did not now draw it. He preferred to engage supernatural enemies with the weapons that nature had given him, and entered the cave on tiptoe with slow cautious steps; his fists tightly clenched and ready for instant action, yet thrust {{into the pockets of}} his <b>coatee</b> in a deceptively peaceful way, as if he meant to take the ghosts by surprise.|$|E
6000|$|... "The guards set to, to {{run after}} me, {{and when they}} got in sight of me fired their guns; but they were flurried, and the bullets flew past without one of them {{touching}} me. Then I felt pretty safe. If they stopped to load their muskets, I should get clean away. If, as I expected, they would not stop for that, {{they would not have}} a chance with me, carrying their muskets and cartridge boxes and belts. I had taken off my <b>coatee</b> and boots, while I was waiting for the start, and went up the hill like a deer.|$|E
60|$|Not {{until after}} all was over was Fergus {{aware of the}} escapes he had had. A bullet had cut away an {{ornament}} from his headdress, one of his reins had been severed {{at a distance of}} an inch or two from his hand, a bullet had pierced the tail of his <b>coatee</b> and buried itself in the cantle of his saddle, and the iron guard of his claymore had been pierced. However, on his return to the king after carrying a despatch, he was able to curb his own excitement and that of his horse, and to make the formal military salute as he reported, in a calm and quiet voice, that he had carried out the orders with which he had been charged.|$|E
60|$|As for us men, {{buckskin}} {{formed the}} principal material of our garments. We all wore buckskin breeches, and gaiters, and moccasins. The latter, however, had the white-man's soles; though Guert took a pair or two {{with him that}} were of the pure Indian manufacture. Each of us had a <b>coatee,</b> made of common cloth; but we all carried hunting-shirts, to be worn {{as soon as we}} entered the woods. These hunting-shirts, green in colour, fringed and ornamented garments, of the form of shirts to be worn over all, were exceedingly smart in appearance, and were admirably suited to the woods. It was thought that the fringes, form, and colour, blended them so completely with the foliage, as to render them in a manner invisible to one at a distance; or at least, undistinguished. They were much in favour with all the forest corps of America, and formed the usual uniform of the riflemen of the woods, whether acting against man, or only against the wild beasts.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is very ungracious, Conway. Mr. Regan is {{a retired}} pork {{merchant}} of Cork. He has given up his business and bought an estate here, and settled down as a country gentleman. They say {{his father was a}} pig-driver in Waterford. That's why he has bought a place {{on this side of the}} county. But people have been rather shy of them; because, though he could buy three-fourths of them up, his money smells of pork. Still, as the election is coming on, they have relaxed a bit. He's got the militia band, and there will be lashings of everything; and his girls are nice girls, whether their father sold pork or not. And it would be nothing short of cruel if we, the representatives of his majesty's army, did not put in an appearance; especially as we have doubtless eaten many a barrel of his salt pork at sea. So put on your number one <b>coatee</b> and let's be off." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{uniform of}} the {{trumpeters}} from 1804 consisted of a helmet with a red or white mane, a blue single-breasted <b>coatee</b> with cuffs and a collar edged with silver or white lace, and white lace at buttonholes on the front. Before 1810, the trumpeters of the 1st and 4th trumpeters had a white helmet mane, a red plume, a red <b>coatee,</b> red collar and cuffs edged silver, white turnbacks with red grenades, seven laces on the chests, and red epaulettes. The 6th regiment in circa 1810-1812 wore a white helmet mane and red plume, a blue <b>coatee</b> with orange edged silver cuffs and collar, red epaulettes with a white crescent, and orange laces on the chest. The 7th regiment wore a yellow <b>coatee</b> and the 8th regiment wore an orange one. The 13th regiment, in 1812, wore a white helmet mane, a wine red <b>coatee</b> with five white laces in front. They did not wear the cuirass and were mounted on white and gray horses.|$|E
50|$|Remarkably, {{a uniform}} <b>coatee</b> {{of a man}} of the RNSR still exists. This <b>coatee</b> is one of the {{earliest}} surviving military uniforms known to exist in Canada, and is currently held at the Army Museum at the Halifax Citadel. It confirms that the RNSR wore red coats with royal blue facings, with plain white lace for other ranks, and buttons in pairs. Given the wings on the shoulders, this would have been the <b>coatee</b> of {{a man of the}} grenadier or the light infantry company. This uniform would have been worn circa 1798.|$|E
