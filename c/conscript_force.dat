5|$|World War I was {{the most}} devastating in British {{military}} history, with nearly 800,000 men killed and over twomillion wounded. Early in the war, the BEF was virtually destroyed and was replaced first by volunteers and then a <b>conscript</b> <b>force.</b> Major battles included those at the Somme and Passchendaele. Advances in technology saw {{the advent of the}} tank (and the creation of the Royal Tank Regiment) and advances in aircraft design (including the creation of the Royal Flying Corps) which would be decisive in future battles. Trench warfare dominated Western Front strategy for most of the war, and the use of chemical weapons (disabling and poison gases) added to the devastation.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman force {{prepared}} to repel a landing {{on either side}} of the Straits was the 5th Army. This force, which initially consisted of five divisions with another en route, was a <b>conscript</b> <b>force,</b> commanded by von Sanders. Many of the senior officers in the 5th Army were also German. Ottoman commanders and senior German officers debated the best means of defending the peninsula. All agreed that the best defence was to hold the high ground on the ridges of the peninsula. There was disagreement as to where the enemy would land and hence where to concentrate forces. Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Kemal was familiar with the Gallipoli peninsula from his operations against Bulgaria in the Balkan Wars and forecast that Cape Helles (the southern tip of the peninsula) and Gaba Tepe were the likely areas for landing.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{advised that}} the German Reichswehr be a {{voluntary}} {{rather than a}} <b>conscript</b> <b>force</b> (the French preference), and that the French Occupation of the Rhineland be temporary rather than permanent. Hankey was impressed by advice from Wilson that harsh financial terms might drive Germany to Bolshevism and thence to alliance with Russia and Japan, and had Wilson repeat his presentation to the Prime Minister at a special “away weekend” at Fontainebleau (March 1919), where he was sceptical of the League of Nations and urged a strong Anglo-French Alliance, perhaps even accompanied by {{the building of a}} Channel Tunnel. These proposals were written up as the “Fontainebleau Memorandum” outlining Lloyd George’s preferred peace terms.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{within the}} Kingdom of the Netherlands, there are small local <b>conscript</b> <b>forces</b> {{on the islands}} of Aruba (Arumil) and Curaçao (Antmil). These operate {{under the auspices of}} the Royal Netherlands Navy and Marines.|$|R
50|$|Military districts (also called {{military}} regions) are formations of a state's {{armed forces}} (often of the Army) which {{are responsible for}} a certain area of territory. They are often more responsible for administrative than operational matters, and in countries with <b>conscript</b> <b>forces,</b> often handle parts of the conscription cycle.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, the Army of the United States {{was formed}} as a {{successor}} to the National Army. The Army of the United States operated on the same principles as its predecessor, combining Regular Army, National Guard, and <b>conscript</b> <b>forces</b> into one fighting unit. The Army of the United States also incorporated Reserve forces.|$|R
50|$|The Army of Burkina Faso (L'Armée de Terre - Ground Forces or LAT) is a {{skeletonized}} {{force structure}} of some 5,800-6,000 officers and men, augmented by a <b>conscript</b> <b>force</b> or People's Militia of some 45,000 men and women. Unlike {{the police and}} security forces, the Army and the People's Militia are organized along Soviet/Chinese models and precepts. The Army is equipped with light wheeled armored cars, some mounting cannon.|$|E
50|$|World War I was {{the most}} devastating in British {{military}} history, with nearly 800,000 men killed and over two million wounded.

5000|$|When the South Korea-led {{international}} investigation's {{report on}} the sinking was released on 20 May 2010 there was international condemnation of the North's actions. China was an exception as they simply termed the incident [...] "unfortunate" [...] and [...] "urged stability on the peninsula." [...] This was speculated to be China's concern for instability on the Korean peninsula. Christian Oliver stated in The Financial Times that South Korea needs to explain why its navy started shooting northwards immediately, thus risking starting a war, and give reassurance on the competence of predominantly <b>conscript</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Torah ark had the {{capacity}} to house 50 Torah scrolls and was built on two levels. It was flanked by four Corinthian columns surrounded by baroque woodcuts depicting flowers and birds. The Ark, together with its ornamental gates, were taken from the Nikolayevsky Synagogue in Kherson, Russia, which had been used by Russian Jewish <b>conscripts</b> <b>forced</b> to spend twenty-five years in the Imperial Russian Army. Directly above the Ark was a triangular window with rounded points. To the right and in front of the ark was the cantor's podium, which was designed as a miniature version of the two-level Ark.|$|R
50|$|The {{content of}} Questions and Replies differs {{strongly}} {{from the other}} six Military Classics. The armies that existed {{by the time of}} the Tang dynasty consisted of infantry, crossbowmen, and cavalry. The use of the chariot had long since ceased to have any military application, and weapons were exclusively made from iron and steel. Large number of local, cohesive units provided a great degree of flexibility to large-scale deployments. Professional units were supplemented by disciplined and well-armed <b>conscript</b> <b>forces.</b> Weapons and unit sub-types were highly specialized. The recognition of the military value of speed and mobility was widespread, with flanking and other indirect maneuvers preferred over direct, frontal engagements.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The Armenian Armed Forces is {{moving from a}} <b>conscript</b> <b>force</b> to a volunteer force. They {{are based on a}} soviet-era military structure, but are attempting to adopt a Western-style of force structure, similar to the U. S. and U. K. A key element in this is the establishment of a professional NCO corps within the Armenian Army. As they seek to develop the senior enlisted ranks, as well as move to an all-volunteer force, they have identified the need to re-evaluate their current military pay and compensation structure. This must all be done with an eye toward long-term personnel costs, which is currently not happening. This project developed a cost model to examine the various life cycle costs of the military compensation system for the Armenian Army. The focus is on the structure of the Armenian Army peacekeeping brigade and incorporates the new, proposed professional NCO corps into a new rank and pay structure. The model allows the Armenians to adjust criteria to look at the cost implications of various manpower policy decisions. It also provides total compensation costs on an annualized basis, allowing policy makers to make informed budgeting decisions. The results show the costs at different manpower and rank mixes.

40|$|This paper forcuses on a key {{military}} institution in eighteenth-century Britain - the New Militia - {{and argues that}} it was of fundamental political and social importance as well. The militia {{was the product of}} a republican political culture that distrusted 'standing armies' and instead placed its faith in armed citizens for home defence. As well as being safer (and cheaper) than professional armies, the militia was lauded in terms of masculinity and domestic feeling: a citizen soldier would be more motivated than a mercenary, as he was fighting for family, property and country. Indeed, the New Militia was formed during a panic {{about the state of the}} nation's men and morals in the Seven Years War. The resulting institution, however, was very different to this vision of citizen soldiers: effectively a <b>conscript</b> <b>force</b> drawn from the poor that was led by local elites, where military rank mirrored social and political standing. This paper therefore thinks about how far the idea of the 'citizen soldier' survived in practice in the militia between the 1750 s and the 1810 s. Looking at the life writings of privates and officers alike, it will explore political and national identities in terms of gender, suggesting that there is an important martial strain in political masculinities...|$|E

25|$|This can be {{compared}} to an estimated 670,000, with 210,000 conscripts, in 1995–96. These numbers should be treated with caution, however, due to the difficulty for those outside Russia to make accurate assessments, and confusion even within the General Staff on the numbers of <b>conscripts</b> within the <b>force.</b>|$|R
25|$|The only active units {{immediately}} {{available in}} an emergency were those of the standing alert force of some 15,000 career soldiers supplemented by eight-month <b>conscripts.</b> The <b>force</b> was organized as a mechanized division consisting of three armoured infantry brigades. Each brigade was composed of one tank battalion, one mechanized infantry battalion, and one selfpropelled artillery battalion. Two of the brigades had antitank battalions equipped with self-propelled weapons. The divisional headquarters was at Baden near Vienna; the three brigades were based in separate locations, also in the northeast of the country.|$|R
50|$|After World War II the Austrian Armed Forces (Bundesheer) were {{reestablished}} as a <b>conscript</b> military <b>force.</b> A {{basic part}} of it is the milita, which is a regular reservists force of the Bundesheer, comparable to the national guard units of the United States. The conscript soldiers of the milita have to store their military equipment at home, to be mobilized quite fast within a few days in case of emergency. The system was established during the Cold War and still exists, but the members of the militia now are volunteers only.|$|R
50|$|In April 1915, the Ottoman {{government}} began the systematic extermination of its minority Armenian subjects, {{known as the}} Armenian Genocide. The genocide carried out during and after World War I was implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through executions and subjection of army <b>conscripts</b> to <b>forced</b> labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly and infirm on death marches towards the Syrian Desert. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived {{of food and water}} and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre.|$|R

5000|$|Joy McCorriston took a {{slightly}} different viewpoint: It is clear that early (800-400 bc) political authority resided with one leader - a mlk, or king of his own ethnic tribe ...appointed as mukarrib of a council of tribal leaders. The mukarrib issued edicts that carried out decisions by the council and presided over building projects, ritual hunts, and sacrifices. Some {{of the most famous}} inscriptions record the military conquests of mukarribs, who were evidently quite successful in confederating tribal groups through the rites of pilgrimage (at Jabal al-Lawdh, for example) and then using such social cohesion to <b>conscript</b> military <b>forces.</b>|$|R
