5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of genuine opposition, the liberalized {{election}} format allowed for various power struggles to be played out, primarily between the <b>communist</b> <b>party</b> candidates. A particularly notable case was the rivalry between certain candidates from the main <b>communist</b> <b>party</b> (PZPR) {{and one of the}} lesser communist parties (ZSL).|$|E
5|$|Editor Larssen and subeditor Solbakken both {{joined the}} <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> in 1923 and {{continued}} running the newspaper. As Olav Larssen {{was asked by}} the party to be the acting editor of Norges Kommunistblad in the winter of 1924–1925, Fredrik Monsen, Evald Solbakken, and Knut Olai Thornæs were acting editors between 1924 and 1925. Larssen eventually drifted away from the mainstream of the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> In late 1926 and early 1927 he voiced his opinion in columns that the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> should contribute to the imminent merger of the Labour Party and the Social Democratic Labour Party. A local party convention strongly rebuked this opinion. Larssen was thus replaced in January 1927 and left the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> and Solbakken soon followed suit. Fredrik Monsen left the party at the same time.|$|E

40|$|The article {{builds on}} Ishiyama's (1998) seminal study of <b>Communist</b> {{successor}} <b>parties</b> [Ishiyama, J. T., 1998.

The article outlines four paths undertaken by <b>Communist</b> <b>parties</b> in former <b>Communist</b> states: those countries that rapidly transformed <b>Communist</b> <b>parties</b> into center-left parties; countries that were slower at achieving this; countries with imperial legacies; and Eurasian autocracies. The fate of successor <b>Communist</b> <b>parties</b> is discussed within the parameters of previous regime type, political opposition in the Communist era and the nationality question...|$|R
5|$|In the 1945 election, the Communists were unopposed {{because the}} other parties abstained. Once in power, the Communists {{introduced}} a single-party political system, in which the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of Yugoslavia was the ruling party and the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of Croatia was its branch. In 1971, the Croatian national movement, which sought greater civil rights and the decentralisation of the Yugoslav economy, culminated in the Croatian Spring, which was suppressed by the Yugoslav leadership. In January 1990, the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> fragmented along national lines; the Croatian faction demanded a looser federation.|$|E
5|$|Media in the Eastern Bloc was {{an organ}} of the state, {{completely}} reliant on and subservient to the <b>communist</b> <b>party,</b> with radio and television organizations being state-owned, while print media was usually owned by political organizations, mostly by the local <b>communist</b> <b>party.</b> Soviet propaganda used Marxist philosophy to attack capitalism, claiming labor exploitation and war-mongering imperialism were inherent in the system.|$|E
5|$|Pablo and Mandel {{aimed to}} counter the {{opposition}} of the majorities inside the British Revolutionary <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> and French Internationalist <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> Initially, they encouraged party members to vote out their leaderships. They supported Gerry Healy's opposition in the RCP. In France, they backed elements, including Pierre Frank and Marcel Bleibtreu, opposed to the new leadership of the PCI albeit for differing reasons.|$|E
50|$|There are multi-party {{states with}} <b>Communist</b> <b>parties</b> leading the government.

25|$|Gay {{men were}} {{sometimes}} denied membership or expelled from <b>communist</b> <b>parties</b> {{across the globe}} during the 20th Century, as most <b>communist</b> <b>parties</b> followed the social precedents set by the USSR. However, {{this was not the}} case in the West.|$|R
25|$|While the <b>Communist</b> <b>parties</b> of {{the world}} {{no longer had a}} formal {{international}} organization, they continued to maintain close relations with each other through a series of international forums. In the period directly after dissolution of Comintern, periodical meetings of <b>Communist</b> <b>parties</b> were held in Moscow. Moreover, World Marxist Review, a joint periodical of the <b>Communist</b> <b>parties,</b> {{played an important role in}} coordinating the communist movement up to the break-up of the Socialist Bloc in 1989-1991.|$|R

He was also a candidate member of the Central Committee of the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> between 1986 and 1990. During the March 1989 Soviet Union legislative election, the first relatively free Soviet elections, Snetkov, who was backed by the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> lost his seat, which represented a district in Yaroslavl, to reformist Lieutenant Colonel Viktor Podziruk, in a campaign focused {{on the issue of}} the existence of the Soviet draft.|$|E
5|$|The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) is {{the highest}} internal-control {{institution}} of the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of China (CPC), tasked with enforcing internal rules and regulations and combating corruption and malfeasance in the Party.

5|$|A {{month after}} Arbeideren went defunct, the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> gave {{its name to}} a new {{newspaper}}, which was set up as the new main newspaper of the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> in 1930. This new paper was based in Oslo as the replacement of Norges Kommunistblad, which had been liquidated as well. Olav Larssen and Evald Solbakken found a new outlet in Hamar Arbeiderblad, which {{had been set up}} as the new Hamar organ of the Labour Party in 1925. The <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> later tried to create a weekly newspaper in Hamar, Rød Front, but it was short-lived and existed only between 1932 and 1933. The Oslo version of Arbeideren went defunct in 1940, and many years after that, the name was used from 1951 to 1953 for a third newspaper, published in Brumunddal, not far from Hamar city.|$|E

5|$|After {{attending}} the Far Eastern People's Conference in the Soviet Union, Nosaka returned to Japan in 1922, and {{helped found the}} Japanese <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (JCP) that same year. Nosaka was more secretive {{about his relationship with}} the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> than he had been in Britain, and kept his membership a secret from Bunji Suzuki and other moderate labour leaders. After his return, Nosaka worked as a trade unionist and editor of the JCP's official newspaper, Musansha Shimbun.|$|E
5|$|Arbeideren ("The Worker") was a Norwegian newspaper, {{published}} in Hamar, Hedmark county. It {{was started in}} 1909 as the press organ of the Labour Party in Hedemarken and its adjoining regions, and was called Demokraten ("The Democrat") until 1923. It was issued {{three days a week}} between 1909 and 1913, six days a week in 1914, three days a week again between 1914 and 1918 before again increasing to six days a week. It was renamed to Arbeideren in 1923, and in the same year it was taken over by the Norwegian <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> The <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> incorporated the newspaper Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad into Arbeideren in 1924, and until 1929 the newspaper was published under the name Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad. After Arbeideren had gone defunct, the name was used by the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> for other newspapers elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, 1923, the Labour Party {{broke out of}} the Comintern. Subsequently the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> {{broke away from the}} Labour Party. The local chapter of the Labour Party in Hamar decided to side with the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> in November 1923, in a 123–22 vote. Arbeideren was then taken away from Labour, as the {{supervisory}} council decided by a 65 to 5 vote that it should follow the Communists. Arbeideren was one of thirteen Labour newspapers that broke away from the party and followed the Communists (one, Nordlys, later returned to Labour). Since 15 February 1924 the newspaper was published under the name Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad, as the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> had seen fit to merge Arbeideren with Lillehammer-based Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad.|$|E

She joined the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> at the age of 18, and in 1929 traveled to the Soviet Union as a Scottish delegate to a gathering of young communists. She founded a local children's wing of the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> carried out a successful agitation to declare 1 May a school holiday, and worked for communist Member of Parliament Willie Gallacher. She retired from active politics at the age of 60, but continued to give talks and write her memoirs, published in 1991 as A Miner's Lass.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis took {{advantage}} of the fire to advance their own political aims. The Reichstag Fire Decree, passed the next day on Hitler's urging, suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. Activities of the German <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> were suppressed, and some 4,000 <b>communist</b> <b>party</b> members were arrested. Göring demanded that the detainees should be shot, but Rudolf Diels, head of the Prussian political police, ignored the order. Some researchers, including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock, are of the opinion that the NSDAP itself was responsible for starting the fire.|$|E

5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt {{proved to be}} a further blow to relations between the Parchamites and Khalqists. The Parchamites deny that they ever planned to assassinate the Khalqist leadership, but historian Beverley Male argues that Karmal's subsequent activities give credence to the Khalqist view of events. Because of the Parchamite {{assassination attempt}}, Amin pressed the Khalqist PDPA to seize power in 1976 by ousting Daoud. The majority of the PDPA leadership voted against such a move. The following year, in 1977, the Parchamites and Khalqists officially reconciled, and the PDPA was unified. The Parchamite and Khalqist PDPAs, which had separate general secretaries, politburos, central committees and other organisational structures, were officially unified in the summer of 1977. One reason for unification was that the international communist movement, represented by the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of India, Iraqi <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> and the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of Australia, called for party unification.|$|E
5|$|The post-World War II Sabor {{developed}} from the National Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Croatia (ZAVNOH), formed in 1943. In 1945, ZAVNOH transformed itself into the National Sabor of Croatia, preserving the continuity of Croatian sovereignty. After the war, the Communists ran unopposed in the 1945 elections; all opposition parties boycotted the elections due to coercion and intimidation by the OZNA secret police and the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> aimed at eliminating electoral dissent. Once in power, the Communists introduced a single-party political system, with the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of Yugoslavia as the ruling party and the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of Croatia as a branch party. In January 1990, the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> fragmented along national lines, with the Croatian faction demanding a looser federation. During Communist rule, the Sabor went from a unicameral parliament as specified by the 1947 constitution, to bicameral in 1953, changing again in 1963 {{to as many as}} five chambers, and then to three in 1974. The constitutional amendments of 1971 established the Presidency of the Sabor, and one of its functions became representing Croatia, as the Yugoslav constituent republics were essentially viewed as nation-states generally surrendering only their foreign and defence policies to the federation; the federal bodies were no longer independent of, but instead formed by, the republics.|$|E
5|$|Tohari's second novel, Kubah {{was written}} in two months {{and based on the}} events {{surrounding}} the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> and the 30September Movement coup in 1965. Published in 1980 by Pustaka Jaya, Kubah came at a time when literary works with similar themes– the victimisation of <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> members– were scarce. The novel has also been characterised as dawah (Islamic preaching). Reception of Kubah was mostly mixed; critics praised the novel for its subject matter and criticised it for its predictability. It received a literary award in 1981, and in 1986 it was translated into Japanese.|$|E
