40|$|In practice, {{to reduce}} default risks, a {{retailer}} frequently offers its bad credit customers a partial trade credit, {{in which the}} retailer requests its customers to pay {{a portion of the}} purchase amount at the time of placing an order as a <b>collateral</b> <b>deposit,</b> and then grants a permissible delay {{on the rest of the}} purchase amount. By contrast, the retailer usually provides a full trade credit to its good credit customers without the collateral deposits. For generality, in this paper, I establish an economic order quantity (EOQ) model for a retailer who receives a full trade credit by its supplier, and offers either a partial or a full trade credit to its customers. The proposed model is in a general framework that includes numerous previous models as special cases. I then analyze the characteristics of the optimal solution, and provide an easy-to-use closed-form optimal solution. Finally, I use a real-world inventory problem to illustrate the proposed model and its optimal solution. Inventory EOQ Partial trade credit Permissible delay in payments...|$|E
40|$|I, {{like so many}} {{of those}} who fi lled the fi rst ranks of family practice, often {{described}} my career choice as a calling, a vocation, something more than a meal ticket. It was a source not only of pride and conviction but also resentment and resistance to change. By mid career I was largely out of step with new movements in family medicine that veered from the generalist approach toward focused fel-lowships, added qualifi cations, and offi ce practices that opted out of obstetrics and hospital work. As often happens, it was a patient of mine who brought the issue into focus and showed me the potential that lay in each encounter.

5000|$|Central {{counterparty}} clearing, {{also referred}} to as central counterparty (CCP), is a financial institution that provides clearing and settlement services for trades in foreign exchange, securities, options and derivative contracts. A clearing house stands between two clearing firms (also known as member firms or participants). Its purpose is to reduce the risk a member firm failing to honor its trade settlement obligations. A CCP reduces the settlement risks by netting offsetting transactions between multiple counterparties, by requiring <b>collateral</b> <b>deposits</b> (also called [...] "margin deposits"), by providing independent valuation of trades and collateral, by monitoring the credit worthiness of the member firms, and in many cases, by providing a guarantee fund {{that can be used to}} cover losses that exceed a defaulting member's <b>collateral</b> on <b>deposit.</b> The advantages of a central counterparty clearing arrangement are greater transparency of the risks, reduced processing costs, and greater certainty in cases of default by a member.Once a trade has been executed by two counterparties, it is submitted to a clearing house, which then steps between the two original traders' clearing firms and assumes the legal counterparty risk for the trade. For example, a trade between member firm A and firm B becomes two trades: A-CCP and CCP-B. This process is called novation.|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} system remains vulnerable to weak governance in smaller banks {{and also to}} weaknesses in banks’ balance sheets. Banking is characterized by high real interest rates, large spreads, and a limited appetite for lending. Stress tests indicate that the banking system is relatively resilient to the direct effects of individual shocks, with credit risk having the greatest impact. Deficiencies in the framework for banks’ liquidity management are developmental in nature but {{need to be addressed}} to avoid systemic problems.

25|$|The Initial Margin {{is the sum}} {{of money}} (or <b>collateral)</b> to be <b>deposited</b> by a firm to the {{clearing}} corporation to cover possible future loss in the positions (the set of positions held is also called the portfolio) held by a firm. Several popular methods are used to compute initial margins. They include the CME-owned SPAN (a grid simulation method used by the CME and about 70 other exchanges), STANS (a Monte Carlo simulation based methodology used by the OCC), TIMS (earlier used by the OCC, and still being used by a few other exchanges).|$|R
50|$|Margin {{requirements}} are reduced for positions that offset each other. For instance spread traders who have offsetting futures contracts {{do not have}} to <b>deposit</b> <b>collateral</b> both for their short position and their long position. The exchange calculates the loss in a worst-case scenario of the total position. Similarly an investor who creates a collar has reduced risk since any loss on the call is offset by a gain in the stock, and a large loss in the stock is offset by a gain on the put; in general, covered calls have less strict requirements than naked call writing.|$|R

40|$|The broad aim of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} knowledge of Islamic banking theories and practices to banking and finance scholars and practitioners in Nigeria, as well as draw some useful insights on Islamic banking in Nigeria. Prohibition of interest, low consumer lending, profit and loss sharing and high real sector investing are primary characteristics of Islamic banks. Islamic banks operate the three conventional deposit accounts. They also engage in investment financing, trade financing, lending, and other financial services. Differences between Islamic and conventional banks lie in prohibition of interest, emphasis on Islamic principles of morality, emphasis on <b>collateral,</b> certainty of <b>deposits</b> and returns, liquidity risk and solvency risk; while similarities between Islamic and conventional banks lie in profit-making objective and nature of banking services. Though there is a dearth of Islamic banks in Nigeria, Islamic banking has become a fast growing concept.

2500|$|An {{originally}} classified 1984 US interagency {{intelligence assessment}} states that {{in both the}} preceding 1970s and 80s, the Soviet and US military were already following the [...] "existing trends" [...] in warhead miniaturization, of higher accuracy and lower yield nuclear warheads, this is seen when assessing the most numerous physics packages in the US arsenal, which in the 1960s were the B28 and W31, however both quickly became less prominent with the 1970s mass production runs of the 50 Kt W68, the 100 Kt W76 and in the 1980s, with the B61. This trend towards miniaturization, enabled by advances in inertial guidance and accurate GPS navigation etc., was motivated by a multitude of factors, namely the desire to leverage the physics of equivalent megatonnage that miniaturization offered; of freeing up space to fit more MIRV warheads and decoys on each missile. Alongside the desire to still destroy hardened targets but while reducing the severity of fallout <b>collateral</b> damage <b>depositing</b> on neighboring, and potentially friendly, countries. As {{it relates to the}} likelihood of nuclear winter, the range of potential thermal radiation ignited fires was already reduced with miniaturization. For example, the most popular nuclear winter paper, the 1983 TTAPS paper, had described a 3000 Mt counterforce attack on ICBM sites with each individual warhead having approximately one Mt of energy; however not long after publication, Michael Altfeld of Michigan State University and political scientist Stephen Cimbala of Pennsylvania State University argued that the then already developed and deployed smaller, more accurate warheads (e.g. W76), together with lower detonation heights, could produce the same counterforce strike with a total of only 3 Mt of energy being expended. They continue that, [...] if the nuclear winter models prove to be representative of reality, then far less climatic-cooling would occur, even if firestorm prone areas existed in the target list, as lower fusing heights such as surface bursts, would also limit the range of the burning thermal rays due to terrain masking and shadows cast by buildings, while also temporarily lofting far more localized fallout when compared to airburst fuzing – the standard mode of employment against un-hardened targets. This logic is similarly reflected in the originally classified 1984 Interagency Intelligence assessment, which suggests that targeting planners would simply have to consider target combustibility along with yield, height of burst, timing and other factors {{to reduce the amount of}} smoke to safeguard against the potentiality of a nuclear winter. Therefore, as a consequence of attempting to limit the target fire hazard by reducing the range of thermal radiation with fuzing for surface and sub-surface bursts, this will result in a scenario where the far more concentrated, and therefore deadlier, local fallout that is generated following a surface burst forms, as opposed to the comparatively dilute global fallout created when nuclear weapons are fuzed in air burst mode.|$|R
