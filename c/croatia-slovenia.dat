5|$|Since 2003, Croatian {{foreign policy}} has focused on {{achieving}} the strategic goal of becoming a member state of the European Union (EU). In December 2011, Croatia completed the EU accession negotiations and signed an EU accession treaty on 9 December 2011. Croatia joined the European Union on 1 July 2013 marking {{the end of a}} process started in 2001 by signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and Croatian application for the EU membership in 2003. A recurring obstacle to the negotiations was Croatia's ICTY co-operation record and Slovenian blocking of the negotiations because of <b>Croatia–Slovenia</b> border disputes. The latter was resolved through an Arbitration Agreement of 4 November 2009, approved by national parliaments and a referendum in Slovenia.|$|E
5|$|The {{land border}} {{disputes}} pertain to comparatively small strips of land. The <b>Croatia–Slovenia</b> border disputes are: along the Dragonja River's lower course where Slovenia claims three hamlets on the river's left bank; the Sveta Gera peak of Žumberak where exact territorial claims were never made {{and appear to}} be limited to a military barracks on the peak itself; and along the Mura River where Slovenia wants the border to be along the current river bed instead of along a former one and claims a (largely if not completely uninhabited) piece of land near Hotiza. These claims are likewise {{in the process of being}} settled by binding arbitration.|$|E
5|$|In early 2000, Croatia and Serbia {{set up a}} {{commission}} tasked with determining the border, but in its first ten years it convened only once or twice. Since 2010, the issue has gained increasing prominence in the disputing countries. Plans for construction of a port in Apatin, {{on a piece of}} territory claimed by Croatia, added fuel to the dispute. After years of inactivity the inter-governmental commission established to identify and determine the border between Croatia and Serbia met in Zagreb in April 2010, only to conclude that there was a difference of opinions on the matter. Later that month, the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) proposed a National Assembly resolution which would require that Serbian officials resolve the dispute in compliance with the Serbian claim. Months later, Radoslav Stojanović, a former legal representative of Serbia and Montenegro in the Bosnian Genocide Case and former ambassador to the Netherlands, likened the dispute to the <b>Croatia–Slovenia</b> border dispute in the Gulf of Piran. Stojanović said that the position held by Croatia in its dispute with Slovenia was favourable for Serbia and warned that Serbia might be in a disadvantageous position if Croatia joined the European Union (EU) before Serbia—which would allow it to impose its conditions to the process of accession of Serbia to the EU.|$|E
50|$|<b>Croatia-Slovenia</b> is {{a one-day}} cycling race {{that has been}} held {{annually}} since 2008. It is part of UCI Europe Tour in category 1.2. It was formerly known as Ljubljana-Zagreb and Zagreb-Ljubljana.|$|E
50|$|In the {{following}} months, the party helped organize an antifascist demonstration against far-right groups celebrating the Nazi collaborator in Croatia, Ante Pavelić, during a church mass for Pavelić. The protest was assaulted by {{supporters of the}} Croatian far-right. Soon after that, Workers' Front staged the first organized cutting of the razor wire planted along the <b>Croatia-Slovenia</b> border, together with Slovenian activists in a cross-border demonstration of solidarity. The action was widely reported by regional media.|$|E
50|$|<b>Croatia-Slovenia</b> {{relations}} are foreign relations between Croatia and Slovenia. Croatia has an embassy in Ljubljana and two honorary consulates in Maribor and Koper. Slovenia has an embassy in Zagreb and an honorary consulate in Split. The countries share 670 km of common border. Relations between Slovenia and Croatia are {{generally considered to}} be friendly, as they have been historically, equally by both sides, but plagued with a series of unresolved border disputes and other vestiges from the time when both countries were the northernmost part of SFR Yugoslavia.|$|E
50|$|Bossman's {{campaign}} {{focused on}} {{encouraging people to}} drive electric cars, building a golf course to promote tourism, and promoting local products. He has also pledged to work to try to improve <b>Croatia-Slovenia</b> relations, which have been recently strained {{over a number of}} minor border disputes. Bossman has stated that race was not much of an issue during the election, although he did receive criticism on account of his supposed lack of fluency in Slovene. He has stated that a friend, a professor of Slovene, has offered to give him additional lessons.|$|E

40|$|The {{beginning}} of the year 2015 was marked by numerous refugee deaths in the Mediterranean sea. As a consequence, an already existing path called the Balkan Route gained more importance. Slovenia is one of the countries on this route, and even before the first refugees came to <b>Croatia-Slovenia</b> border, the Antiracist Front Without Borders was established. As explained by the interviewees, the activities of the Front took place in three phases: the first phase was marked by solidarity protests and the second by activities on the borders of the Balkan Route. In the third phase, the Front initiated a network and started to organize activities with the refugees who have applied for asylum in Slovenia. Interviewees also speak about self-organization and mutual learning, integration, humanitarianism and existing asylum policy...|$|E
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{reconstruct}} two crucial phases {{in the management}} of the protracted territorial conflict between Croatia and Slovenia over the common State border: (i) The causal mechanisms of the genesis of the Arbitration Agreement during the Croatian accession negotiations with the EU 2008 / 2009, and (ii) the conflict dynamics during the subsequent arbitration procedure before the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) 2012 - 2017. The method employed is process tracing based on elite interviews (politicians and civil servants) and informal documents. The arbitral award from 29 June 2017 is the end of a formal process, but not of the substantive dispute. Bilateral conflict between an EU Member State (Slovenia) and a Candidate Country (Croatia at the time) creates de facto add-on political conditionality. The <b>Croatia-Slovenia</b> case has profound implications on the SFRY successor States and EU enlargement in the Western Balkans...|$|E

40|$|Purpose was {{to examine}} if chronic {{exposure}} of feral fish to elevated Pb concentrations in the river water (up to 1 μg L- 1), which are still lower than European recommendations for dissolved Pb in surface waters (7. 2 μg L- 1; EPCEU 2008), would result in Pb accumulation in selected fish tissues. Lead concentrations were determined by use of HR ICP-MS in the gill and hepatic soluble fractions of European chub (Squalius cephalus) caught in the Sutla River (<b>Croatia-Slovenia).</b> At the site with increased dissolved Pb in the river water soluble gill Pb levels (17. 3 μg L- 1) were approximately 20 times higher compared to uncontaminated sites (0. 85 μg L- 1), whereas the ratio between contaminated (18. 1 μg L- 1) and uncontaminated sites (1. 17 μg L- 1) was lower for liver (15. 5). Physiological variability of basal Pb concentrations in soluble gill and hepatic fractions associated to fish size, condition, sex or age was not observed, excluding the possibility that Pb increase in chub tissues at contaminated site could be the consequence of studied biotic parameters. However, in both tissues of Pb-exposed specimens, females accumulated somewhat more Pb than males, making female chubs potentially more susceptible to possible toxic effects. The fact that Pb increase in gill and hepatic soluble fractions of the European chub was not caused by biotic factors and was spatially restricted to one site with increased dissolved Pb concentration in the river water points to the applicability of this parameter as early indicator of Pb exposure in monitoring of natural waters...|$|E
