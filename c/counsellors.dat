5|$|The Sovereign is {{traditionally}} advised by various <b>counsellors,</b> including the peers of the realm. After the Norman conquest of England, peers were summoned {{to form the}} magnum concilium, or Great Council, {{which was one of}} the four councils belonging to the Sovereign. The other three were the Privy Council, Parliament (which was called the commune concilium, or Common Council), and judges (who are considered <b>counsellors</b> of the Sovereign on legal matters).|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the {{national}} education system of Romania exists a network of offices that support school work school counse llors. According to legislation, a <b>counsellor</b> serves a total of 800 students. Economic situation really makes a <b>counsellor</b> to work with over 1000 students, plus parents and teachers. The aim is to identify the role of school <b>counsellor</b> in Romania and to identify the perception of students {{on the importance of}} activities undertaken by school <b>counsellor,</b> using an questionnaire-based survey. The research revealed that the main obstacles in the school <b>counsellor's</b> activity are related to management of schools, limited material resources and large number of beneficiaries. The results show that the relationship with the <b>counsellor,</b> students primarily want trust and discretion. School <b>counsellor</b> is often exceeded by the large number of beneficiaries and the multitude of problems faced. Students perceive positively his activity, but is still insufficient awareness of its role in school and what services are offered (for free) by the school <b>counsellor...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{balance of}} Privy <b>Counsellors</b> is largely {{made up of}} politicians. The Prime Minister, Cabinet ministers and the Leader of HM Opposition are {{traditionally}} sworn of the Privy Council upon appointment. Leaders of major parties in the House of Commons, First Ministers of the devolved assemblies, some senior Ministers outside Cabinet, and on occasion other respected senior parliamentarians are appointed Privy <b>Counsellors.</b>|$|E
5|$|British {{political}} institutions include the Westminster system, the Commonwealth of Nations and Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Although the Privy Council {{is primarily a}} British institution, officials from other Commonwealth realms are also appointed to the body. The most notable continuing instance is the Prime Minister of New Zealand, its senior politicians, Chief Justice and Court of Appeal judges are conventionally made Privy <b>Counsellors,</b> as the prime ministers and chief justices of Canada and Australia used to be. Prime Ministers of Commonwealth countries which retain the British monarch as their sovereign continue to be sworn as Privy <b>Counsellors.</b>|$|E
5|$|Few Privy <b>Counsellors</b> are {{required}} to attend regularly. The settled practice is that day-to-day meetings of the Council are attended by four Privy <b>Counsellors,</b> usually the relevant Minister to the matters pertaining. The Cabinet Minister holding the office of Lord President of the Council, currently the Rt Hon. Andrea Leadsom , invariably presides. Under Britain's modern conventions of parliamentary government and constitutional monarchy, every order made in Council is drafted by a Government Department and has already {{been approved by the}} Minister responsible—thus actions taken by the Queen-in-Council are formalities required for validation of each measure.|$|E

5|$|Although the Privy Council is {{primarily}} a British institution, officials from some other Commonwealth realms are also appointed. By 2000, the most notable instance was New Zealand, whose Prime Minister, senior politicians, Chief Justice and Court of Appeal Justices were traditionally appointed Privy <b>Counsellors.</b> However, appointments of New Zealand members have since been discontinued. The Prime Minister, the Speaker, the Governor-General and the Chief Justice of New Zealand are still accorded the style Right Honourable, but without membership of the Council. Until the late 20th century, the Prime Ministers and Chief Justices of Canada and Australia were also appointed Privy <b>Counsellors.</b> Canada also has its own Privy Council, the Queen's Privy Council for Canada (see below). Prime Ministers of some other Commonwealth countries that retain the Queen as their sovereign continue to be sworn of the Council.|$|E

40|$|Professional {{education}} {{is integral to}} the life of a profession. This article offers an historical review of <b>counsellor</b> education in Aotearoa New Zealand {{from the point of view}} of educators in one programme. It suggests that inquiry about what has been might contribute to shaping what might ensue in <b>counsellor</b> education. Suggesting that <b>counsellor</b> education might be described as on the verge of entering a third phase, the article traces the first two phases, reviewing influences of government policy, the wider profession, other stake-holders, and <b>counsellor</b> educators themselves on the directions and forms that <b>counsellor</b> education has taken. Following these traces through history, the article looks toward a third phase, offering a series of questions about the possible opportunities and leadership responsibilities available to counselling education and educators. By ending with inquiry, the article seeks to make a contribution to a dialogue among <b>counsellor</b> educators that might actively contribute to shaping the future of <b>counsellor</b> education.

5|$|It was {{formerly}} regarded by the Privy Council as criminal, and possibly treasonous, {{to disclose the}} oath administered to Privy <b>Counsellors</b> as they take office. However, the oath was officially made public by the Blair Government in a written parliamentary answer in 1998, as follows. It had also been read out in full in the House of Lords during debate by Lord Rankeillour on 21 December 1932.|$|E
5|$|Privy <b>Counsellors</b> {{have the}} right to sit {{on the steps of the}} Sovereign's Throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords during debates, a {{privilege}} which was shared with heirs apparent of those hereditary peers who were to become members of the House of Lords before Labour's partial Reform of the Lords in 1999, diocesan bishops of the Church of England yet to be Lords Spiritual, retired bishops who formerly sat in the House of Lords, the Dean of Westminster, Peers of Ireland, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery and the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. While Privy <b>Counsellors</b> {{have the right}} to sit on the steps of the Sovereign's Throne they do so only as observers and are not allowed to participate in any of the workings of the House of Lords. Nowadays this privilege is rarely exercised. A notable recent instance of the exercising of this privilege was used by the Prime Minister, Theresa May, who watched the opening of the debate of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill 2017 in the House of Lords.|$|E

50|$|Although a republic, Finland has a {{tradition}} of awarding titles for distinguished citizens. The available titles are listed in the presidential decree on titles (381/2000). The titles are classified in 16 categories of precedence. The two highest titles are valtioneuvos/statsråd (State <b>Counsellor)</b> and vuorineuvos/bergsråd (Mining <b>Counsellor).</b> The former is usually awarded to most distinguished, retired politicians, while the latter is meant for the CEOs of the largest Finnish companies. Less distinguished titles span different walks of life. Curiosities include liikenneneuvos (traffic <b>counsellor),</b> kotiseutuneuvos (home district <b>counsellor)</b> and nuorisoasiainneuvos (youth affairs <b>counsellor).</b> In total, there are about 100 different titles. A Finnish title is purely honorary, causing no responsibilities and giving no privileges. All Finnish titles are non-hereditary.|$|R

5|$|In the 13th century, Newcastle upon Tyne had a {{population}} of around 4,000; and {{it was difficult for}} the four parish churches to care for the needs of such a large population. The priests were expected to be educators, doctors and <b>counsellors,</b> as well as meeting the spiritual needs of their parishioners. Therefore, in 1291 land was donated by William Baron of Wark on Tweed to found an Augustinian friary on the land on which the museum now stands.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Ulysses (in Greek, Odysseus) has been explored widely in literature. The adventures of Odysseus were first recorded in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey (c. 800–700 BC), and Tennyson draws on Homer's narrative in the poem. Most critics, however, find that Tennyson's Ulysses recalls Dante's Ulisse in his Inferno (c. 1320). In Dante's re-telling, Ulisse is condemned to hell among the false <b>counsellors,</b> both for {{his pursuit of}} knowledge beyond human bounds and for creating the deception of the Trojan horse.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCounsellor trainee self-efficacy {{explains}} {{the capability of}} performing the role of <b>counsellor.</b> Being able to practice their role {{as well as to}} apply counselling skills whilst performing counselling practicum promotes trainee perceived self-efficacy. The counselling practicum provides opportunities for trainees to practice their knowledge and skills with the real clients as well as to gain experience for future work. Despite this, the counselling practicum involves fulfilling the required tasks. Being able to fulfil the required task may contribute to their self-efficacy and promote their development as a <b>counsellor.</b> The aim {{of this article is to}} explore self-efficacy experienced by <b>counsellor</b> trainees, and in what ways those experiences promote development. Qualitative methods involving a series of semi-structured interviews, journal writing, observation and review of related documents were employed with ten participants during the counselling practicum. The findings of the study reveal that self-efficacy among <b>counsellor</b> trainees develops during their counselling practicum. The stories of the trainees indicate that development of efficacy among <b>counsellor</b> trainees involves acceptance of the tasks and roles, openness to new experiences as well as realistic perceptions of the situation. Whilst development of the <b>counsellor</b> trainees during the counselling practicum is not a smooth process, their perceived self-efficacy is increased continuously. Performing the role of <b>counsellor</b> and engaging in the counselling practicum creates opportunities to test and be tested in their ability as a <b>counsellor,</b> which promotes their perceived self-efficacy and impacts their development as a <b>counsellor...</b>|$|R

5|$|On the {{question}} of images, Elizabeth's initial reaction was to allow crucifixes and candlesticks and the restoration of roods, {{but some of the}} new bishops whom she had elevated protested. In 1560 Edmund Grindal, one of the Marian exiles now made Bishop of London, was allowed to enforce the demolition of rood lofts in London and in 1561 the Queen herself ordered the demolition of all lofts. Thereafter, the determination to prevent any further restoration was evidenced by the more thoroughgoing destruction of roods, vestments, stone altars, dooms, statues and other ornaments. The queen also appointed a new Privy Council, removing many Roman Catholic <b>counsellors</b> by doing so. Under Elizabeth, factionalism in the Council and conflicts at court greatly diminished. The Act of Supremacy was passed without difficulty.|$|E

While Pyrrhus {{and most of his}} <b>counsellors</b> interpreted the dream as indicating that they would seize Sparta by storm, his friend Lysimachus warned him that places struck by thunderbolts were usually avoided and that Pyrrhus was destined not to enter Sparta. Pyrrhus dismissed this interpretation and buoyed by what he deemed to be a portentous sign, he prepared his men for a further assault.|$|E

He told the Viceroy that he intended to remain neutral and could not take any actions that were overtly pro-British. Indian intelligence became aware—after the expedition had already been Kabul for some time—that they carried with them highly inflammatory letters from the Kaiser and the Turkish Sultan.
