30|$|In this study, {{the five}} {{different}} types of <b>contractors,</b> namely: building, civil, mechanical, electrical, and specialist <b>contractors</b> were differentiated. However, this study only focuses on two categories of <b>contractors,</b> namely, building and civil <b>contractors</b> due to their big number of registration but with poor growth trends (National Bureau of Statistics 2013). For example, registered <b>contractors</b> for building and civil works were 5418 (which is 80 %) out of all registered 6762 <b>contractors</b> in Tanzania {{by the end of}} year 2012. The remaining 20 % of the registered companies belong to electrical, mechanical, and specialist <b>contractors.</b> It is important to consider the number of <b>contractors</b> registered until 2012 because the number of <b>contractors</b> does change at some points with some new companies being registered while others which are not complying with the CRB’s requirements are deleted from the list of <b>contractors.</b> Consequently, firms’ activities were determined by asking respondents to “indicate the firm’s main line of business” (Varukolu and Park-Poaps 2009), which is building works or civil works (or both) in this case.|$|R

5|$|As {{part of the}} US Department of Labor’s (DOL) governmentwide {{implementation}} of the Davis-Bacon Act, federal regulations require that all laborers and mechanics who work for a <b>contractor</b> or subcontractor on federally financed construction contracts over $2,000 must be paid wages not less than those the DOL established for the project location (i.e., the prevailing wage). This Compliance Requirement was created to assure that recipients oblige contractors {{to comply with the}} Davis-Bacon Act, by including in their construction contracts with a <b>contractor</b> or subcontractor a clause or requirement to comply with the Davis-Bacon Act and the DOL regulations. The clause should also include a requirement for the <b>contractor</b> or subcontractor to submit to the recipient weekly (e.g., for each week in which any contract work is performed) a copy of the construction payroll accompanied by statement of compliance. This report is commonly referred to as “certified payrolls”, and is often done using Optional Form WH-347 (OMB No. 1215-0149), a standard form pre-designed by the OMB.|$|E

40|$|For a long time, foreign <b>contractors</b> have {{dominated}} construction business in Tanzania. Foreign <b>contractors</b> who constitute less than 3 % of all registered <b>contractors</b> {{in the country}} execute about 70 % of large and medium-sized contracts. These foreign <b>contractors</b> come and go depending on the business climate, which dictates work opportunities. As a result, lack of exposure, erosion of capital and eventual loss of confidence have stifled {{the growth of the}} domestic <b>contractors.</b> If this trend is allowed to continue, the local construction capacity will continue to dwindle and eventually perish. CRB is now working out various strategies designed to improve the performance of local <b>contractors,</b> thus increasing their share of the local construction market. These measures include structured training in business management and marketing strategies, promotion of partnerships between local and foreign <b>contractors</b> as a means of providing on-the-job training, policy review and promotion of <b>contractors</b> associations...|$|R
