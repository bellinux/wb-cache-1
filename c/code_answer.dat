This paper shows how these rules facilitate inter-object communication and enable frequently occurring design patterns to be implemented {{in a way that}} leads to more understandable, maintainable and reusable <b>code.</b> <b>Answer</b> Overview ANSWER (Automatic Network Surveillance with Expert Rules) can be understood by viewing its input/output behavior: it receives alarms from 4 ESS switches and outputs alerts when it believes human action may be warranted. ANSWER's intelligent decision making is controlled by its knowledge base [...] - which has been implemented in R++. The 4 ESS has a well defined object model and hence ANSWER was able to benefit from object-oriented rules. The object model is based on the view of a 4 ESS switch as a hierarchical [...] ...|$|E

The Polynomics Telecommunication Regulation Index 2012 aims to provide such a measure for telecommunications.

40|$|The Web {{has changed}} the {{dynamics}} of programming. We are in an era where reusing code from the Web is frequently the norm, not the exception. In this era, programmers use question and answer (Q&A) sites like StackOverflow to pose coding questions and receive <b>coding</b> <b>answers.</b> Programmers using these sites often engage in a complex code foraging process of understanding and adapting the code snippets they encounter to determine their fitness for use. While search still dominates modern code retrieval, search alone offers little support for validating search results for fitness of use. This is, in large part, due to the inherently questionable quality of online source code. Most online source code is not guaranteed to be good, to work properly, or to be trustworthy.

Source Code Curation is a blend of filtering, refinement, and validation activities.

40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} {{various ways}} in which users can indicate their location while using an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) service. Using an IVR survey, 71 low-income users of a live IVR service in India conveyed their location in three different ways: a postal code, a fixed line area code, and a free response. In each configuration, users spoke their location and a human transcribed the result, thereby eliminating any dependence on DTMF input proficiency or speech recognition accuracy. The analysis of survey responses suggests that people are aware and capable of representing their location with a postal code and fixed line area code. However, using the free response data as ground truth, there was higher accuracy using fixed-line area <b>codes</b> (72 % <b>answered</b> correctly) versus postal <b>codes</b> (55 % <b>answered</b> correctly).

40|$|Classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes {{were first}} {{introduced}} by Robert Gallager in the 1960 's and have reemerged {{as one of}} the most influential coding schemes. We present new families of quantum low-density parity-check error-correcting codes derived from regular tessellations of Platonic 2 -manifolds and from embeddings of the Lubotzky-Phillips-Sarnak Ramanujan graphs. These families of quantum error-correcting <b>codes</b> <b>answer</b> a conjecture proposed by MacKay about the existence of good families of quantum low-density parity-check codes with nonzero rate, increasing minimum distance and a practical decoder. For both families of codes, we present a logarithmic lower bound on the shortest noncontractible cycle of the tessellations and therefore on their distance. Note that a logarithmic lower bound is the best known in the theory of regular tessellations of 2 -manifolds. We show their asymptotic sparsity and non-zero rate. In addition, we show their decoding performance with simulations using belief propagation. Furthermore, we present a general geometrical model to design non-additive quantum error-correcting codes for the amplitude-damping channel. Non-additive quantum error-correcting codes are more general than stabilizer or additive quantum errorcorrecting codes, and in some cases non-additive quantum codes are more optimal. As an example, we provide an 8 -qubit amplitude-damping code, which can encode 1 qubit and correct for 2 errors. This violates the quantum Hamming bound which requires that its length start at 9. by Reina Riemann. Thesis (Ph. D.)
