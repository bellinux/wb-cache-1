50|$|A {{variant of}} the <b>Chukka</b> <b>boot</b> is the desert boot, but these always have crepe rubber soles and they {{typically}} have suede uppers. Desert boots were popularized in the 1950s by UK shoe company C. & J. Clark.|$|E
50|$|According to shoe {{historian}} June Swann, {{the essential}} <b>chukka</b> <b>boot</b> is ankle-high, open-laced, and unlined, with {{two to three}} pairs of eyelets, thin leather soles, calfskin suede uppers in two parts (each from {{a single piece of}} leather; quarters sewn on top of vamp), and rounded toes.|$|E

50|$|Daily colours vary per term {{but usually}} {{consist of a}} short-sleeved khaki shirt, khaki shorts, knee-length grey socks, and <b>chukka</b> <b>boots.</b> This is worn to the classroom, the dining hall, on weekends, and during social hours. The key {{differences}} between summer and winter daily colours are that a green safari hat is often worn in summer (instead of the cap) and the school's sweatshirt, gloves and scarf may be worn during the winter term. In wet seasons, the boys may be allowed to wear Wellington <b>boots</b> instead of <b>chukka</b> <b>boots.</b>|$|R

50|$|They are {{sometimes}} considered light boots, and can essentially {{be considered a}} subset of <b>chukka</b> <b>boots</b> or desert boots although vellies {{tend to have a}} lower topline. Veldskoen soles {{are sometimes}} cut from old car tyres rather than crepe rubber.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Chukka</b> <b>boots</b> (...) are ankle-high {{leather boots}} with suede or leather uppers, leather or rubber soles, and open lacing {{with two or}} three pairs of eyelets. The name chukka {{possibly}} comes from the game of polo, where a chukka is a period of play.|$|R
50|$|Mark McNairy New Amsterdam — Recently, McNairy has {{launched}} an English and American inspired footwear range {{as the first}} component of his eponymous label. The shoes — which are made in Northamptonshire, England — are split into two sections. The first group, called Red Brick Soul, features a selection of dirty bucks, saddle shoes, <b>chukka</b> <b>boots</b> and loafers that all sport the red brick colored sole. Alternatively, the New England Collection features a selection of more formal designs that mix traditional English and American styles in a rather tongue-in-cheek manner.|$|R
5000|$|The summer term usually commences {{one week}} after each new year. During this term, new boys (known as [...] "lighties") join the school whilst {{existing}} boys progress to the next grade, which requires moving into a new dormitory house ("dorms"). Unlike the other two terms, all boys must take part in compulsory cross country running every morning and sometimes in the afternoon too. Junior boys (grades 3 and 4) complete a 3 kilometre course known as the [...] "sadac" [...] because its route winds around SADC headquarters, while senior boys (grades 5 to 7) take a longer route colloquially {{referred to as the}} [...] "dip tank" [...] which is approximately 5 kilometres. Most boys participate in track and field athletics and long-distance running, with few taking part in racquet sports such as tennis. The daily uniform in summer consists of short-sleeved khaki shirts, khaki shorts, knee-length grey socks, veldskoen <b>chukka</b> <b>boots</b> and, on weekends, a safari hat. This is worn to lessons, the dining hall, and during social time but is substituted for full colours for Sunday chapel service.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the history}} of the desert boot can trace its lineage back to the basic brown leather <b>Chukka</b> type <b>boots</b> worn by British and Australian {{commonwealth}} forces of North Africa in WWII, current modern incarnations of the boot did not come until the 1970s from nations like Saudi Arabia, who fielded the first traditional direct molded sole, camel-skin beige style boot for use by the Royal Saudi Land Force, with the [...] "zig-zag" [...] sole of the boots inspired directly by the American made black leather [...] "McNamara boot".|$|R
50|$|Though Red Wing Shoes {{is known}} {{primarily}} for their leather boots intended for heavy work, {{in recent years}} the company has expanded its line-up to include athletic-styled work shoes and footwear designed for specific job applications (such as slip-resistant shoes designed for the service industry and boots ideal for the mining industry that utilize a metatarsal guard). The company produces Oxfords, <b>chukkas,</b> hiking <b>boots,</b> and logger styles, as well as 6-inch and 8-inch work boots. While the core of Red Wing's focus is on work boots, in 2008 Red Wing Shoes added a Heritage catalog and also has experimented with more fashion-oriented shoes.|$|R
