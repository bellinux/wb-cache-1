SLD is estimated from sound velocity profiles (SVP) which is in turn obtained from temperature and salinity (T/S) profiles. Given the limited availability of salinity data in comparison to temperature, SVPs need to be obtained from alternate methods. In the present work, to make use of voluminous temperature data sets from XBT, CTD and other source for estimating SLD, we propose a method of utilizing XBT measurements and World Ocean <b>Atlas</b> <b>climatological</b> salinities to compute SVP and then extract SLD. This approach is demonstrated by utilizing T/S data from Argo floats in the Arabian Sea (40 0; &#x 2013; 80 0; E and 0 &#x 2013; 30 0; N). SLD is estimated from SVP obtained from Argo T/S profiles first and again by replacing the Argo salinity with climatological salinity. It is found that in more than 90 % of cases, SLD matched exactly, with the root mean square deviation ranging from 3 &#x 2013; 12 m with an average of 7 m...|$|R
40|$|Session - Tropical Cyclone Intensity 5 : External Influences on Tropical Cyclone IntensityThe {{relationship}} between empirical maximum potential intensity (MPI) of tropical cyclone and sea surface temperature (SST) {{has been applied}} widely to tropical cyclone intensity forecast models in the literature and real time forecast. Several authors have attempted {{in the past to}} develop the relationship for different ocean basins. However, due to the use of different datasets and treatment of data, it is still uncertain whether there is a universal empirical equation that relates MPI to SST in all ocean basins. We re-examine this problem by using a uniform method of processing data from all 7 ocean basins, and evaluate the effects of the choice of different SST datasets on the MPI-SST relations. This study further assesses the uncertainty of maximum surface wind speed in SST bins where the number of observations is small and suggests ways for improvement. This study shows {{that there is not a}} uniform relationship linking SST to MPI for the entire globe, and each ocean basin has its own MPI-SST relationship. There are two types of MPI-SST relation a) exponential, and b) (nearly) linear. The choice of the SST dataset and study period also affects the MPI-SST relation. The MPI-SST relations are relatively consistent between ERA-interim and JRA- 55 reanalysis data, but the relationship derived using the World Ocean <b>Atlas</b> <b>climatological</b> SST is different. Furthermore, if the number of observations in an SST bin is limited (e. g. 10), the percentage error of the sampled maximum intensity is worse than 40 %. Thus MPI is not a robust statistics, and similarly for the MPI-SST relations. An alternative 99 th percentile intensity-SST relation is proposed, which is more robust and less sensitive to the choice of dataset and the number of observations. postprin...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} MEDAR/MEDATLAS II {{project was}} to archive and rescue {{multidisciplinary}} in-situ hydrographic and bio-chemical data of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea through a wide cooperation of countries and to produce a <b>climatological</b> <b>atlas</b> of 12 core parameters, which include temperature and salinity, dissolved oxygen, hydrogen sulphur, alkalinity, phosphate, ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, silicate, chlorophyll and pH. Gridded fields have been computed using the Variational Inverse Model and calibrated by Generalized Cross Validation, by making usual assumptions on the statistical distribution of data and errors. They have been produced for both the Mediterranean and the Black Sea and several additional sub-basins including the Alboran Sea, the Balearic Sea, the Gulf of Lyons and the Ligurian Sea, the Sicily Strait, the Adriatic Sea, the Aegean Sea, the Marmara Sea and the Danube shelf area at climatic, seasonal and monthly scale when relevant. Inter-annual and decadal variability of T/S for both basins have been computed as well. The resulting atlas is made available, free of charge, at "[URL] and on CD-Rom. We discuss here some technical issues relating {{to the use of}} coastal data in the objective analysis and provide a few examples of features appearing in the climatology.

40|$|Sea surface {{temperature}} (SST), at {{the interface between}} the atmosphere and the ocean, is {{an important element in}} the global climate system. Accurate estimates of past SSTs are indispensable for studying global climate and for validating the numerical models used for projections of future climate. SSTs prior to the instrumentation era could be reconstructed using climatically sensitive biomarkers such as alkenones and glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs). Herein I use marine sediments, both core-tops and long piston cores, to further examine the applicability of organic SST proxies derived from the aforementioned biomarkers, with an emphasis on the relatively under-studied subantarctic Southeast Pacific. The appraisal of these proxies is based on the correlation of the core-top proxy index values with present-day climatological SST, and the comparison of the SST records inferred from these proxies with other regional SST records. The alkenone index (UK 37 and UK 37) values in the South Pacific core-tops display linear relationships with <b>climatological</b> World Ocean <b>Atlas</b> 2009 (WOA 09) SST at low temperatures (1 - 12 °C), with equally high r 2 values (> 0. 93). These results suggest that both alkenone indices are highly correlated to SST even at high latitudes, rendering them appropriate for reconstructing SST in the subantarctic Pacific. However, these indices yield different Pleistocene SST patterns for study sites in the subantarctic sector of the Southern Ocean. Judging from the better structural fit of UK 37 SST records with other subantarctic surface proxy records, including foraminiferal &# 61540; 18 O and SST records inferred from diatom- and foraminiferal assemblages, it appears that the UK 37 index results in more plausible paleo SST records in this region, as opposed to the commonly used UK 37 index. The GDGT index (TEX 86 and TEX 86 L) values in the subpolar and polar core-tops (with overlying SSTs of - 2 to 17 °C) are not highly correlated (r 2 values < 0. 3) to the annual mean WOA 09 SST. Plotting these indices against seasonal SSTs and water temperatures at various hydrographic boundaries does not improve the correlation. Nevertheless, when these data are combined with previously published core-top data (n = 630) spanning a SST range of - 2 to 30 °C, the r 2 values of these relationships improve to ~ 0. 8, with a better correlation for the TEX 86 compared to TEX 86 L. The TEX 86 calibration yields SST estimates that are in better agreement with the WOA 09 SST for subpolar and polar regions, rendering it a better SST index in these regions. Meanwhile, applying the GDGT index on a Southeast Pacific sediment core yields SSTs that are colder than those inferred from the alkenones, and the GDGT-derived interglacial SSTs are ~ 3 °C colder than annual mean WOA 09 SST. Given the lack of seasonality in the archaeal abundance here, the cold-biased GDGT estimates probably reflect sub{{surface temperature}} instead of SST. The three SST records presented here allow for further understanding of the surface oceanographic variability in the subtropical and subantarctic Southeast Pacific over the past 700 kyr. The extent of glacial cooling increases with latitude, up to ~ 8 °C in the subantarctic as opposed to the ~ 4 °C in the subtropics. Intense cooling at high latitudes results in larger latitudinal SST gradients during glacials than interglacials. The alkenone-inferred SSTs along the latitudinal range of the Peru-Chile Current (PCC) imply massive equatorward migrations of the Southern Ocean frontal systems and increased equatorward transport of subantarctic waters owing to a stronger PCC during glacials. In addition, GDGT-derived temperatures suggest enhanced subsurface warming during MIS 11 and 13 in the subtropical Southeast Pacific, plausibly due to water column reorganization analogous to that occurring during modern-day El-Niño conditions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{evaluate}} a technique for filtering out clouds in order to obtain vertical temperature and moisture profiles over Brazil using Advanced TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (ATOVS). This evaluation consists of a sequence of tests using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) infrared images and the Mask AVHRR for Inversion ATOVS (MAIA) algorithm. Two distinct versions of this algorithm were used, namely, forecast (F) and climatology (C). Precipitable water (PW) and surface temperature data as forecast by a global numerical weather prediction model were used in the former case, while a <b>climatological</b> <b>atlas</b> of PW was used in the other. In both cases PW was estimated using Advanced Microwave Sensor Unit (AMSU) data over ocean areas. The results show that MAIA does evidence coherence between the areas classified as cloudy and those ones sorted as cloudy according to a visual (subjective) comparison of images. The two versions of the cloud mask algorithm yielded similar results mainly over the southwest Atlantic Ocean. However, over continental areas it was observed a small increase in areas given as clear when the F version was used. Furthermore, it was also observed that the cloud mask is highly sensitive to changes in the threshold values based on the brightness temperature standard deviation in oceanic areas...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEvapotranspiration {{is a key}} {{parameter}} {{for water}} stress assessment as it {{is directly related to}} the moisture status of the soil-vegetation system and describes the moisture transfer from the surface to the atmosphere. With the launch of the Meteosat Second Generation geostationary satellites and the setup of the Satellite Application Facilities, it became possible to operationally produce evapotranspiration data with high spatial and temporal evolution over the entire continents of Europe and Africa. In the frame of this study we present an evaluation of the potential of the evapotranspiration (ET) product from the EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis (LSA-SAF) for drought assessment and monitoring in Europe. To assess the potential of this product, the LSA-SAF ET was used as input for the ratio of ET to reference evapotranspiration (ET 0), the latter estimated from the ECMWF interim reanalysis. In the analysis two case studies were considered corresponding to the drought episodes of spring/summer 2007 and 2011. For these case studies, the ratio ET/ET 0 was compared with meteorological drought indices (SPI, SPEI and Sc-PDSI for 2007 and SPI for 2011) as well as with the anomalies of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (fAPAR) derived from remote sensing data. The meteorological and remote sensing indicators were taken from the European Drought Observatory (EDO) and the CARPATCLIM <b>climatological</b> <b>atlas.</b> Results show the potential of ET/ET 0 to characterize soil moisture variability, and to give additional information to fAPAR and to precipitation distribution for drought assessment. The main limitations of the proposed ratio for drought characterization are discussed, including options to overcome them. These options include the use of filters to discriminate areas with a low percentage vegetation cover or areas that are not in their growing period and the use of evapotranspiration without water restriction (ETwwr), obtained as output of the LSA-SAF model instead of ET 0. The ET/ETwwr ratio was tested by comparing its accumulated values per growing period with the winter wheat yield values per country published by Eurostat.
