This question arises when claims are based on such internationally mandatory rules, but the parties submitted their contract to a foreign law. The specific problems of conflicts of economic regulation are illustrated and discussed on the basis of Belgian and German court decisions relating to <b>commercial</b> distribution and <b>agency</b> <b>agreements.</b> European courts have adopted a restrictive practice of denying the efficacy of such tandems of choice-of-law and arbitration clauses if there is a strong probability that their internationally mandatory rules will not be applied in foreign procedures. This article shows that neither this approach nor the much more pro-arbitration biased solutions proposed by critics are convincing. It elaborates a third solution, which allows national courts to reconcile their legislator’s intention to enforce a given public policy with the parties’ original intention to arbitrate and to optimize the effectiveness of both public interests and arbitration...|$|R

40|$|Franchise {{agreements}} are instruments {{of the global}} economy and a clear example of business expansion. In this sense, agreements such as the <b>commercial</b> <b>agency</b> and franchising help to meet the objectives of the entrepreneurs to reach more consumers in more countries. However, in cross-border business transactions, we may encounter norms which restrict private autonomy as the norms which regulate the termination of the <b>agency</b> <b>agreement</b> in the Code of Commerce of Colombia. In some countries the franchising model is not explicitly regulated, for instance, in Colombia private autonomy plays a prevalent role, that is, the franchisee must be fully aware of the provisions agreed to avoid unfair contracts.

40|$|<b>Commercial</b> <b>Agency</b> Contract The {{subject of}} this thesis is the <b>commercial</b> <b>agency</b> contract, as {{regulated}} by Sections 2483 to 2520 of Act No 89 / 2012, the Civil Code, as amended, giving businesses the opportunity not only to net new customers, but also to raise general awareness of their merchandise or services. Under a <b>commercial</b> <b>agency</b> contract, a <b>commercial</b> agent - as an independent business entity - undertakes to engage long term in activities for the other party (the principal) aimed at the sealing of {{a certain type of}} deal by the principal or at negotiating deals in the name and on behalf of the principal. Under a <b>commercial</b> <b>agency</b> contract, the principal, for its part, agrees to pay the commercial agent commission for the activities carried out. Against this background, a <b>commercial</b> <b>agency</b> contract gives a business the opportunity to make use of a third party who, unlike an employee, is autonomous yet works with the business and acts in its interests. This thesis intends to deliver a lucid analysis and description of a <b>commercial</b> <b>agency</b> contract from the perspective of current legislation set out in the Civil Code, the enactment of which endowed the concept of <b>commercial</b> <b>agency</b> (compared to the previous provisions on <b>commercial</b> <b>agency</b> set out in Sections 652 to 672 a of Act No 513 / 1991, the [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Micro-sized <b>commercial</b> <b>agencies</b> face a poor {{electronic}} and mobile sales support. Most {{of the sales}} information systems are built for the usage within larger-sized companies. Problems particularly appear when processes of multiple suppliers have to {{be integrated into the}} sales processes of the <b>commercial</b> <b>agencies.</b> The paper addresses the issue of process optimization in form of a mobile multi-supplier sales information system for micro-sized <b>commercial</b> <b>agencies.</b> Two major areas of improvements can be realized: Firstly, by an optimized business process integration of multiple SME suppliers and their sales representatives in micro-sized <b>commercial</b> <b>agencies</b> (internal supplier oriented sales processes), and secondly, by an increased mobility in connection with an optimization of sales processes outside of the office infrastructure (external customer sales processes). The paper examines the common processes in <b>commercial</b> <b>agencies</b> and derives relevant processes as well as the appropriate IT-support in form of use cases. The relevant processes and the use cases depend strongly on certain key parameters of a <b>commercial</b> <b>agency's</b> business relationships with its suppliers. Therefore, the paper introduces a branch independent concept for the sales cockpit with the focus on selected sales scenarios, relevant business processes, and derived use cases depending on selected key parameters. By funding the research project M 3 V, the German Ministry of Economies and Technology aims to create a secure, mobile, multi-supplier sales information system as a service for micro-sized <b>commercial</b> <b>agencies...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} study {{is designed to}} analyze the vertical coordination barriers that are present between humanitarian organizations and <b>commercial</b> <b>agencies</b> in times of emergency situation when delivering aid. The main aim of this {{research study}} is to identify those barriers that hinder coordination between both entities. The methodology of this research study {{is based on a}} deductive theoretical approach. This research is qualitative and exploratory in nature. Primary data has been collected through interviews, and secondary data has been collected through libraries, and websites. Data gathered was analyzed in light of the literature review in the frame of reference. Conclusions arrived from this study reflect the answers from the humanitarian organizations and <b>commercial</b> <b>agencies</b> that have been interviewed. Research from the perspective of humanitarian organizations indicate that humanitarian agencies lag behind when it comes to managing their supply chains in times of disaster, whereas, literature from the <b>commercial</b> <b>agencies</b> indicate that <b>commercial</b> <b>agencies</b> manage their supply chains efficiently and effectively. Moreover, humanitarian organizations and <b>commercial</b> <b>agencies</b> have different organizational objectives and manage their supply chains differently and for different purposes. The research shows that humanitarian organizations speak a different language in the sense where humanitarian organizations are not concerned with making profit, as their main goal is to provide aid and assistance to beneficiaries in times of disaster, where this statement is not true for <b>commercial</b> <b>agencies</b> since their end aim is to generate profit. This can be the cornerstone of their main differences and causes of barriers when coordinating together and delivering aid in times of disaster. Based on the conducted interviews and literature review it becomes obvious that there are many vertical coordination barriers between humanitarian organizations and <b>commercial</b> <b>agencies,</b> thus hindering the process of efficient aid delivery to areas struck by disaster. Also, this research study findings suggest that there is an obvious and vast demand for humanitarian organizations to coordinate with <b>commercial</b> <b>agencies</b> and learn from their supply chain practices {{especially when it comes to}} logistical capabilities and services...|$|R

40|$|It is {{a long-standing}} {{antitrust}} principle that agency relationships {{are exempt from}} price-fixing violations. But the agency relationship must be "genuine. " To discern genuine <b>agency</b> <b>agreements,</b> the prevailing approach adopted in both the United States and the European Union focuses on whether the agent has incurred any specific risk or cost {{in relation to the}} distribution of the manufacturer's goods. Yet this approach has tended to obscure the economic nature of agency relationships. The real question to ask is not whether the agent has incurred any specific cost or risk, but instead whether, in a given case, an agency model, rather than a distribution model, actually constitutes a more efficient form for organizing distribution functions between the contracting parties. In fact, over {{a quarter of a century}} ago, Judge Richard Posner proposed a business justification approach for analyzing <b>agency</b> <b>agreements</b> in Morrison v. Murray Biscuit. Building on Morrison, and on the economic literature of property rights and agency problems, this article explores the fundamental question of how parties choose to enter into an optimal contractual form, and, moreover, proposes an economic approach to discern genuine <b>agency</b> <b>agreements.</b> It also calls for revision of the current EU Vertical Guidelines on <b>agency</b> <b>agreements,</b> which are so stringent that they deter businesses unnecessarily from entering into agency arrangements.
