5|$|Cantor {{developed}} important {{concepts in}} topology and {{their relation to}} cardinality. For example, he showed that the Cantor set is nowhere dense, but has the same cardinality as the set of all real numbers, whereas the rationals are everywhere dense, but <b>countable.</b> He also showed that all <b>countable</b> dense linear orders without end points are order-isomorphic to the rational numbers.|$|E
5|$|A Markov {{chain is}} a type of Markov process that has either {{discrete}} state space or discrete index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies. For example, it is common to define a Markov chain as a Markov process in either discrete or continuous time with a <b>countable</b> state space (thus regardless of the nature of time), but it is also common to define a Markov chain as having discrete time in either <b>countable</b> or continuous state space (thus regardless of the state space).|$|E
5|$|More formally, a {{tessellation}} or tiling is a {{cover of}} the Euclidean plane by a <b>countable</b> number of closed sets, called tiles, such that the tiles intersect only on their boundaries. These tiles may be polygons or any other shapes. Many tessellations are formed from {{a finite number of}} prototiles in which all tiles in the tessellation are congruent to the given prototiles. If a geometric shape {{can be used as a}} prototile to create a tessellation, the shape is said to tessellate or to tile the plane. The Conway criterion is a sufficient but not necessary set of rules for deciding if a given shape tiles the plane periodically without reflections: some tiles fail the criterion but still tile the plane. No general rule has been found for determining if a given shape can tile the plane or not, which means there are many unsolved problems concerning tessellations.|$|E
25|$|A {{product of}} at most countably many {{separable}} spaces is separable. A <b>countable</b> product of second-countable spaces is second <b>countable,</b> but an uncountable product of second-countable spaces need {{not even be}} first <b>countable.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{exists a}} model of ZF¬C in which real numbers are a <b>countable</b> union of <b>countable</b> sets.|$|E
25|$|Every <b>countable</b> theory {{which is}} satisfiable {{in a model}} is also satisfiable in a <b>countable</b> model.|$|E
25|$|Every <b>countable</b> {{vector space}} over the rationals (or over any <b>countable</b> field) has a basis.|$|E
25|$|For every <b>countable</b> {{signature}} σ, every σ-sentence {{which is}} satisfiable is satisfiable in a <b>countable</b> model.|$|E
25|$|<b>Countable</b> {{models are}} used in set theory. In 1922, Thoralf Skolem proved that if the axioms of set theory are consistent, then they have a <b>countable</b> model. Since this model is <b>countable,</b> its set of real numbers is <b>countable.</b> Skolem {{explained}} why this does not contradict Cantor's uncountability theorem: the model considers its set of real numbers to be uncountable because it contains no one-to-one correspondence between this set and its set of positive integers. The one-to-one correspondence between these sets exists outside the model. In 1963, Paul Cohen used <b>countable</b> models to prove his independence theorems.|$|E
25|$|Every <b>countable</b> theory {{which is}} satisfiable {{in a model}} M, is satisfiable in a <b>countable</b> {{substructure}} of M.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} countability led to <b>countable</b> {{operations}} and {{objects that are}} used in various areas of mathematics. For example, in 1878, Cantor introduced <b>countable</b> unions of sets. In the 1890s, Émile Borel used <b>countable</b> unions in his theory of measure, and René Baire used <b>countable</b> ordinals to define his classes of functions. Building on the work of Borel and Baire, Henri Lebesgue created his theories of measure and integration, which were published from 1899 to 1901.|$|E
25|$|While <b>countable</b> torsion abelian {{groups are}} well {{understood}} through simple presentations and Ulm invariants, {{the case of}} <b>countable</b> mixed groups is much less mature.|$|E
25|$|Any {{union of}} countably many <b>countable</b> sets is itself <b>countable</b> (because it is {{necessary}} to choose a particular ordering for each of the countably many sets).|$|E
25|$|The set of {{transcendental}} {{numbers is}} uncountably infinite. Since the polynomials with rational coefficients are <b>countable,</b> and since each such polynomial has {{a finite number}} of zeroes, the algebraic numbers must also be <b>countable.</b> However, Cantor's diagonal argument proves that the real numbers (and therefore also the complex numbers) are uncountable. Since the real numbers are the union of algebraic and transcendental numbers, they cannot both be <b>countable.</b> This makes the transcendental numbers uncountable.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sense}} of cardinality, {{most members of the}} Cantor set are not {{endpoints}} of deleted intervals. The construction steps, which are <b>countable,</b> each introduce a finite number of endpoints. Therefore the endpoints are also <b>countable,</b> while the whole Cantor set is not.|$|E
25|$|Ulm's theorem for <b>countable</b> reduced Abelian groups.|$|E
25|$|The group S1 of all {{rotations}} of {{a circle}} (the circle group) is not cyclic. Unlike the infinite cyclic group, {{it is not even}} <b>countable.</b> There also exist other infinite rotation groups (such as the set of rotations by rational angles) that are <b>countable</b> but not cyclic.|$|E

25|$|Every <b>countable</b> {{commutative}} ring has a maximal ideal.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} {{resource}} requirement for SNAP, although eligibility requirements vary slightly from state to state. Generally speaking, households may have up to $2,250 in a bank account or other <b>countable</b> sources. If {{at least one person}} is age 60 or older and/or has disabilities, households may have $3,250 in <b>countable</b> resources.|$|E
25|$|Any <b>countable</b> set of real numbers has Lebesgue measure 0.|$|E
25|$|Some {{results in}} {{constructive}} set theory use the axiom of <b>countable</b> choice or the axiom of dependent choice, {{which do not}} imply {{the law of the}} excluded middle in constructive set theory. Although the axiom of <b>countable</b> choice in particular is commonly used in constructive mathematics, its use has also been questioned.|$|E

25|$|In the {{infinite}} version, {{the collection of}} balls can be <b>countable</b> or uncountable.|$|E
25|$|Even in <b>countable</b> graphs, a {{depth-first search}} might {{not succeed in}} {{eventually}} exploring the entire graph, and not every normal spanning tree can be generated by a depth-first search: to be a depth-first search tree, a <b>countable</b> normal spanning tree must have only one infinite path or one node with infinitely many children (and not both).|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of an algebraic closure for a <b>countable</b> field (but not its uniqueness).|$|E
25|$|If p is an {{isolated}} {{point in the}} Stone space, i.e. if {p} is an open set, {{it is easy to}} see that every model realizes p (at least if the theory is complete). The omitting types theorem says that conversely if p is not isolated then there is a <b>countable</b> model omitting p (provided that the language is <b>countable).</b>|$|E
25|$|Not every {{infinite}} graph has {{a normal}} spanning tree. For instance, a complete graph on an uncountable set of vertices {{does not have}} one: a normal spanning tree in a complete graph can only be a path, but a path has only a <b>countable</b> number of vertices. However, every graph on a <b>countable</b> set of vertices does have a normal spanning tree.|$|E
