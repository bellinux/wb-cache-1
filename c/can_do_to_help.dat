At {{the end of the book}} he discusses the possibility that his forecasts may be wrong, a fact which he felt he must acknowledge as a scientist. However, he believes that humanity will only be better off if it follows his prescriptions, so that even if he is incorrect it is the right course of action.|$|E

Instead of accepting the award herself, she had a twenty-two-year-old homeless {{man by the name of}} Jesse collect it for her. She had met him at My Friend’s Place, an organization that helps homeless youth find shelter, work, health care and education. His acceptance speech encouraged musicians to learn more about homeless youth in Los Angeles and what they <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> at Cyrus's Facebook page. Cyrus then launched a Prizeo campaign to raise funds for the charity. Those who made donations were automatically entered into a sweepstake for a chance to meet Cyrus on her Bangerz Tour in Rio de Janeiro that September.|$|E

Medication can reduce pain and discomfort, and also reduce damaging inflammation.|$|E
