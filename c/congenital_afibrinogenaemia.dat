40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{substantial}} progress made {{in understanding the}} molecular basis of inherited afibrinogenaemia (or <b>congenital</b> <b>afibrinogenaemia),</b> an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by the complete absence of detectable fibrinogen. The identification in 1999 of the first genetic defect, recurrent homozygous deletions of approximately 11 kb of the fibrinogen alpha-chain (FGA) gene, revealed that the disease was caused by defective fibrinogen synthesis, {{and led to the}} subsequent analysis of the three fibrinogen genes in other affected individuals with the identification of numerous causative mutations. Combined analyses of more than thirty unrelated afibrinogenaemia families from various ethnic groups have shown that the majority of patients have truncating mutations in the FGA gene although intuitively all three fibrinogen genes might be equally implicated. These results will facilitate molecular diagnosis of the disorder, permit prenatal diagnosis for families who so desire, and pave the way for new therapeutic approaches such as gene therapy...|$|E

Several mutations have also been identified in patients with hypofibrinogenaemia; many of these are heterozygous carriers of afibrinogenaemia null mutations. OBJECTIVE: To report the case of a patient from Slovakia diagnosed with hypofibrinogenaemia characterised by fibrinogen concentrations of around 0. 7 g/l. RESULTS: The patient was found to be heterozygous for a novel missense mutation W 253 C (W 227 C in the mature protein) in the C-terminal globular domain of the fibrinogen gamma chain. Co-expression of the W 253 C FGG mutant cDNA (fibrinogen Bratislava) in combination with wild-type FGA and FGB cDNAs showed that fibrinogen molecules containing the mutant gamma chain can assemble intracellularly but are not secreted into the media, confirming the causative nature of the identified mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Current analysis of fibrinogen Bratislava indicates that the domains important for the processes of hexamer assembly and hexamer secretion should not be considered as strictly restricted to one or other fibrinogen chain...|$|E
40|$|Hypodysfibrinogenaemia due to {{production}} of mutant fibrinogen alpha-chains lacking fibrinopeptide A and polymerisation knob 'A' VORJOHANN, Silja, et al. Inherited disorders of fibrinogen are rare and affect either the quantity (hypofibrinogenaemia and afibrinogenaemia) or {{the quality of}} the circulating fibrinogen (dysfibrinogenaemia) or both (hypodysfibrinogenaemia). Extensive allelic heterogeneity has been found for all these disorders: in <b>congenital</b> <b>afibrinogenaemia</b> for example more than 40 mutations, the majority in FGA, have been identified in homozygosity or in compound heterozygosity. Numerous mutations have also been identified in patients with hypofibrinogenaemia, many of these patients are in fact heterozygous carriers of afibrinogenaemia mutations. Despite the number of genetic analyses performed, the study of additional patients still allows the identification of novel mutations. Here we describe the characterization of a novel FGA intron 2 donor splice-site mutation (Fibrinogen Montpellier II) identified in three siblings with hypodysfibrinogenaemia. Functional analysis of RNA produced by the mutant minigene in COS- 7 cells revealed that the mutation led to the in-frame skipping of exon 2.

40|$|<b>Congenital</b> <b>afibrinogenaemia</b> is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder characterised by the {{complete absence of}} detectable fibrinogen. We previously identified the first known causative mutations for this disorder in a non-consanguineous Swiss family. The four affected male individuals (two brothers and their first two cousins) were shown to have homozygous deletions of approximately 11 kb of the fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA) gene. Haplotype data suggested that the deletions occurred on three distinct ancestral chromosomes, implying that the FGA region of the fibrinogen locus is susceptible to deletion by a common mechanism, but the sequences responsible for the recombination remained to be identified. Here, we report the detailed characterisation of the deletion by nucleotide sequence analysis of all three deletion junctions and comparison with normal sequences. We found that all three deletions were identical to the base-pair and probably resulted from non-homologous (illegitimate) recombination. The centromeric and telomeric deletion junctions featured both a 7 bp direct repeat, AACTTTT, situated in FGA intron 1 and in the FGA-FGB intergenic sequence {{and a number of}} inverted repeats which could be involved in the generation of secondary structures. Analysis with closely linked flanking polymorphic markers revealed the existence of at least two haplotypes, further suggesting independent origins of the deletions in this family...|$|E
40|$|Frequent {{arterial}} and venous thromboembolism {{in patients}} with <b>congenital</b> <b>afibrinogenaemia</b> (CA) is neither understood nor is a safe and effective treatment established. It was our objective {{to report on the}} clinical observations and laboratory data contributing {{to the understanding of the}} frequency, physiopathology, prognosis and treatment of CA. We observed the long-term clinical course and laboratory data in a cohort of four patients with CA and thromboembolic complications, and conducted a systematic review retrieving all available data. Four patients with CA developed recurrent and extensive arterial and venous thromboembolism (TE) from an age of 25 - 38 years. In two patients, a treatment strategy targeting at maintaining constantly measurable Fbg levels (≥ 0. 5 g/l) either by regular Fbg replacement or by orthotopic liver transplantation resulted in long-term remissions. Radiological imaging documented resolved arterial thrombi after 6 - 12 months. In contrast, recurrent thromboembolic events were observed in two other patients with infrequent Fbg replacement. A systematic review of the literature revealed 48 reports of TE {{in patients with}} CA (median age at first event 31 years), and a favourable outcome in most patients with frequent application of Fbg, aimed at constant measurable trough levels. Present data suggests that patients with CA are at high risk of arterial and venous thromboembolic events, probably caused by thrombin excess owing to lack of thrombin scavenging by Fbg/fibrin. Regular low-dose Fbg replacement might be a safe and effective treatment option in patients with CA and thromboembolic complications...|$|E

40|$|Afibrinogenaemia is an {{autosomal}} recessive disease {{with an estimated}} prevalence of approximately one in a million. The most common symptoms of afibrinogenaemia are umbilical cord bleeding, bleeding into skin, mouth, muscles, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts and the central nervous system. Other recognized complications include; haemarthroses, spontaneous splenic rupture, epistaxis, menorrhagia, recurrent abortion and venous and arterial thromboembolism. Bone cysts have also {{been described as a}} rare complication of afibrinogenaemia. The aim {{of this study was to}} conduct a systematic literature review, summarize the reported cases and to report two new cases. Three electronic databases were searched for relevant publications: PubMed, Medline and EMBASE. The following search criteria were used: '(bone cysts OR intraosseous haematoma OR intraosseous haemorrhage) AND (afibrinogenaemia OR fibrinogen deficiency) '. The reference lists of the selected papers were searched for more relevant literature. In total, eight patients had bone cysts as complication of afibrinogenaemia and six of them suffered from pain in their extremities. Bone cysts were primarily located in the vicinity of the cortex or trabeculae in the diaphysis of the long bones, especially in the femora, tibiae and humeri. Some were regressive, probably due to reactive bone remodelling. A number of cysts were filled with serosanguinous fluid. It might be useful to check for bone cysts when patients with <b>congenital</b> <b>afibrinogenaemia</b> complain of 'rheumatic' pains in their extremities. Whole body magnetic resonance imaging is the diagnostic imaging technique of choice. Recurrent episodes of pain, but not radiological deterioration, appear to benefit from prophylactic therapy with fibrinogen concentrate...|$|E
