50|$|A {{report of}} the {{building}} at Millbank Wharf was drawn up by professional valuers in December 1900 {{in anticipation of the}} proposed incorporation of the company following year. The report stated that the main building comprised a three-room office, two storerooms, five cement kilns, two plaster ovens, a lime mill, a rending store, a circular saw bench, an iron store, a <b>cement</b> <b>store</b> and two engine room complete with boilers. Other buildings included lime kilns, coal stores, cement sheds, brick sheds, iron stores, slurry pits, a cement-drying building, a lime house and a chimney shed. The yard had a frontage to the River Itchen of nearly 400 ft and a rear frontage of 460 ft. The value of the whole property was estimated at £6670 freehold.|$|E
50|$|The {{preparations}} at South Queensferry {{were of a}} {{much more}} substantial character, and required the steep hillside to be terraced. Wooden huts and shops for the workmen were put up, {{as well as more}} substantial brick houses for the foremen and tenements for leading hands and gangers. Drill roads and workshops were built, as well as a drawing loft 200 by 60 ft to allow full size drawings and templates to be laid out. A cable was also laid across the Forth to allow telephone communication between the centres at Queensferry, Inchgarvie, and Fife, and girders from the collapsed Tay Bridge were laid across the railway to the west in order to allow access to the ground there. Near the shore a sawmill and <b>cement</b> <b>store</b> were erected, and a substantial jetty around 2100 ft long was started early in 1883, and extended as necessary, and sidings were built to bring railway vehicles among the shops, and cranes set up to allow the loading and movement of material delivered by rail.|$|E

Both types of cement took up water with net uptake varying with the storage solution. Uptake was greatest with KCl and lowest for 0. 9 % NaCl. By comparison with an immature (1 hour old) specimen of each cement, specimens generally showed a distinct increase in bound/unbound water at 6 weeks, though for specimens stored in 0. 9 % NaCl, there was an apparent reduction in this ratio, which is attributed to greater dissolution than uptake in this solution. Specimens stored in the artificial saliva solution Biotene contained significantly lower amounts of unbound water after 6 weeks than in all other solutions. Water was thus shown to become bound within these cements during a relatively slow process, and a mechanism for this water-binding is proposed...|$|R

40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} cements (CPCs) are synthetic {{bone grafting}} materials {{that can be}} used in fracture stabilization and to fill bone voids after, e. g., bone tumour excision. Currently there are several calcium phosphate-based formulations available, but their use is partly limited by a lack of knowledge of their mechanical properties, in particular their resistance to mechanical loading over longer periods of time. Furthermore, depending on, e. g., setting conditions, the end product of acidic CPCs may be mainly brushite or monetite, which have been found to behave differently under quasi-static loading. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the compressive fatigue properties of acidic CPCs, as well as the effect of phase composition on these properties. Hence, brushite <b>cements</b> <b>stored</b> for different lengths of time and with different amounts of monetite were investigated under quasi-static and dynamic compression. Both storage and brushite-to-monetite phase transformation was found to have a pronounced effect both on quasi-static compressive strength and fatigue performance of the cements, whereby a substantial phase transformation gave rise to a lower mechanical resistance. The brushite cements investigated in this study had the potential to survive 5 million cycles at a maximum compressive stress of 13 MPa. Given the limited amount of published data on fatigue properties of CPCs, this study provides an important insight into the compressive fatigue behaviour of such materials. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the Electrochemical Chloride Extraction (ECE) is to remove the chloride ions (Cl-) which are embedded in concrete, since these ions are considered to result in accelerating the process of corrosion in steel reinforcement.

In this paper we present the results of mortar samples made in the laboratory.

40|$|The {{water uptake}} and water loss {{behaviour}} {{in three different}} formulations of zinc oxy-chloride cement have been studied in detail. Specimens of each material were subjected to a high humidity atmosphere (93 % RH) over saturated aqueous sodium sulfate, and a low humidity desiccating atmosphere over concentrated sulfuric acid. In high humidity, the cement formulated from the nominal 75 % ZnCl 2 solutions gained mass, eventually becoming too sticky to weigh further. The specimens at 25 % and 50 % ZnCl 2 by contrast lost mass by a diffusion process, though by 1 week the 50 % cement had stated to gain mass and was also too sticky to weigh. In low humidity, all three cements lost mass, again by a diffusion process. Both water gain and water loss followed Fick's law for a considerable time. In the case of water loss under desiccating conditions, this corresponded to values of Mt/MĄ well above 0. 5. However, plots did not go through the origin, showing {{that there was an}} induction period before true diffusion began. Diffusion coefficients varied from 1. 56 x 10 - 5 (75 % ZnCl 2) to 2. 75 x 10 - 5 cm 2 /s (50 % ZnCl 2), and appeared to be influenced not simply by composition. The drying of the 25 % and 50 % ZnCl 2 cements in high humidity conditions occurred at a much lower rate, with a value of D of 2. 5 x 10 - 8 cm 2 /s for the 25 % ZnCl 2 cement. This cement was found to equilibrate slowly, but total water loss did not differ significantly from that of the <b>cements</b> <b>stored</b> under desiccating conditions. Equilibration times for water loss in desiccating conditions were of the order of 2 - 4 hours, depending on ZnCl 2 content; equilibrium water losses were respectively 28. 8 [25 % ZnCl 2], 16. 2 [50 %] and 12. 4 [75 %] which followed the order of ZnCl 2 content.

Bacterial survival was measured 24 hours after inoculation. All the strains survived in plain cements. In the pre-elution gentamicin-loaded cements only the most gentamicin-resistant strain, CN 5115, survived, but in post-elution samples more strains did so, depending on the cement tested. Although high concentrations of gentamicin were demonstrated in the gaps only the gentamicin-sensitive strains were killed.

40|$|The Intermediate Level Wastes (ILW), {{produced}} during the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, are commonly encapsulated in a {{blast furnace slag}} (BFS) and Portland cement (PC) composite and stored in repositories. These cements are required to safely immobilise these wastes for long durations of time. Additives {{are used in the}} cementitious wastes to further enhance them for example superplasticisers are used in general cement industry to increase fluidity, resulting in large reductions of water required for mixing, giving high early strength development, a decrease in permeability and ultimately significant reduction in costs. However superplasticisers contain molecules that can complex insoluble radioelements such as plutonium and uranium increasing their solubility and in turn mobility. This can be problematic while the cementitious wastes are stored. The standard storage conditions in the UK are that a <b>cement</b> is <b>stored</b> in a steel canister, then a backfill cement such as NRVB (Nirex Reference Vault Backfill cement) is poured over this cement, allowed to set after which the container is sealed. These conditions expose the waste forms to potential contact with ground water in the event of damage to the container. It is therefore important to study the leaching behaviour of these cementitious waste forms and simulate any resultant degradation that would occur over the very long durations they are expected to be stored. The impact of superplasticisers on these leaching behaviours is also investigated to understand the impact these additives have.

Consequently, the mosquito indices exceed the target indices for dengue control with the Breteau Indices of 201 and 113, and Container Indices of 25 and 28 in rural and urban areas, respectively. The containers most fre-quently infested with larvae were rectangular <b>cement</b> containers <b>storing</b> water for bathing (rural: 37. 2 %; urban: 35 %) and flushing the toilets (rural: 35. 7 %; urban: 34. 3 %). Keeping fish [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) : 0. 08 – 0. 16] was the most effective methods of control. Correctly covering containers with lids was similarly effective (AOR: 0. 10 – 0. 25) when used on jars for storing drinking water. However, frequent use of containers reduced the effectiveness of lids. Temephos was effective only in dragon jars in urban areas (AOR: 0. 46) where a standard package of temephos were available. Weekly cleaning of containers was an effective method for larval control in most types of containers. A combination of control methods increased effectiveness. conclusion This study highlights the complex interaction of household water use and larval control practices as well as the importance of determining the most effective control measures compatible with water practices for implementing control promotion...|$|R
40|$|Objectives : Because of poor {{bond between}} resin cement and {{zirconia}} ceramics, laser surface treatments {{have been suggested}} to improve adhesion. The present study evaluated the effect of CO 2 and Nd:YAG lasers on the shear bond strength (SBS) of resin cement to zirconia ceramic. Materials and Methods : Ninety zirconia disks (6 × 2 mm) were randomly divided into six groups of 15. In the control group, no surface treatment was used. In the test groups, laser surface treatment was accomplished using CO 2 and Nd:YAG lasers, respectively (groups two and three). Composite resin disks (3 × 2 mm) were fabricated and cemented to zirconia disks with self-etch resin <b>cement</b> and <b>stored</b> in distilled water for 24 hours. In the test groups four-six, the samples were prepared as in groups one-three and then thermocycled and stored in distilled water for six months. The SBS tests were performed (strain rate of 0. 5 mm/min). The fracture modes were observed via stereomicroscopy. Data were analyzed with one and two-way ANOVA, independent t and Tukey’s tests. Results : The SBS values of Nd:YAG group (18. 95 ± 3. 46 MPa) {{was significantly higher than}} that of the CO 2 group (14. 00 ± 1. 96 MPa), but lower than that of controls (23. 35 ± 3. 12 MPa).

Purpose of this study: was to measure retention of cast restorations cemented with zinc phosphate cement after cleaning the fitting (internal) surfaces from residues of zinc oxide-eugenol provisional cement using different cleaning methods. Material and methods: Sixty standard stainless steel models {{of a standard}} complete crown preparation were prepared. Cast crowns using Type III dental alloy (Midas, Jclenko, N. Y, USA) were fabricated then cemented on their respective models using zinc oxide-eugenol cement (Temp Bond, Kerr, CA, USA). They were stored in artificial saliva at 37 ° for 7 days. The castings were separated from their models using a universal testing machine (Model 1197, Instron, UK). Cleaning of all models was done with a spoon excavator. Specimens were then equally divided into 6 groups of different cleaning methods of residues of zinc oxide-eugenol cement on the fitting surfaces of the cast restorations (hand cleaning, hand cleaning/ultrasonic cleaning, airborne-particle abrasion/ultrasonic cleaning, hand cleaning/ steam cleaning, airborne-particle abrasion/steam cleaning and chemical cleaning). Castings were cemented back using zinc phosphate <b>cement</b> then <b>stored</b> in artificial saliva at 37 ° for 7 days. Retention was measured using a universal testing machine. Data were statistically analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis, non-parametric one-way ANOVA and post-Hoc, non-parametric Tukey Type test. (Alpha value was set at 0. 05). Results: Airborne-particle abrasion/ultrasonic cleaning showed the highest crown retention among other methods. Only airborne-particle abrasion/ultrasonic cleaning, hand cleaning/ultrasonic cleaning and hand cleaning/steam cleaning showed significantly higher crown retention than that of only hand cleaning (P= 0. 027).

Finding little {{employment}} in Brisbane for a plasterer, James opened a small store in George Street, retailing building materials obtained from Sydney. Moreton Bay was passing through a recession at this period, and Campbell's first venture failed. He took odd jobs - timbergetting, fencing, carpentering, painting, bricklaying - until in 1854 {{he was able to}} acquire land in Creek Street, at the corner of Charlotte Street, where he erected a single-storeyed building and commenced business as City Lime, <b>Cement</b> and Plaster <b>Stores</b> - the business which ultimately became James Campbell and Sons. Campbell's business prospered steadily through the 1850s and 1860s. In 1857 he bought additional land in Charlotte Street and in 1864 purchased 36 perches in Creek Street, opposite the city wharves, where he erected a 2-storeyed timber store and residence which remained the firm's headquarters until replaced in 1909 by an imposing five-storeyed brick warehouse. From the early 1860s, Campbell is understood to have operated lime kilns at Breakfast Creek and Lytton, supplied with shell and coral collected from Moreton Bay by sub-contractors.|$|R

Thirty extracted human permanent maxillary molars were endodontically treated. Standardized preparations {{were done with}} 2 -mm intracoronal extensions of the endocrowns into the pulp chamber. Teeth were divided into three groups (n= 10); each group was restored with standardized CAD/CAM fabricated endocrowns {{using one of the}} three tested materials. After cementation with resin <b>cement,</b> specimens were <b>stored</b> in distilled water at 37 °C for one week, subjected to thermocycling, and immersed in a 5 % methylene-blue dye solution for 24 hours. A compressive load was applied at 35 degrees to long axis of the teeth using a universal testing machine until failure. Failure load was recorded, and specimens were examined under a stereomicroscope for modes of failure and microleakage. Results were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni post hoc multiple comparison tests (α= 0. 05). LU showed significantly (p< 0. 05) higher fracture resistance and more favorable fracture mode (ie, fracture of the endocrown without fracture of tooth) as well as higher dye penetration than CB and EX. In conclusion, although using resin nanoceramic blocks for fabrication of endocrowns may result in better fracture resistance and a more favorable fracture mode than other investigated ceramic blocks, more microleakage may be expected with this material...|$|R
40|$|Doble titulacióThe project aims at the {{development}} of silicon doped tricalcium phosphate (Si-α- TCP) and at {{the preparation of the}} corresponding cements for bone tissue engineering applications. There are two principal objectives into this project: First, to optimize the parameters of a wet milling method in order to obtain Si-α- TCP with high purity. Then, to use the Si-α-TCP produced as the main reactant to prepare calcium phosphate cements doped with silicon. The formation of Si-CDHA as final phase is evaluated. The Si-α-TCP is prepared by milling hydroxyapatite and silicon oxide with water, followed by a heat treatment. In order to maximize the preparation of Si-α-TCP phase, some conditions have to be optimized: the reactants ratio, the milling process and the thermal treatment. The study carried out shows that a single stabilized α-TCP phase is produced when hydroxyapatite and silicon oxide, are milled according to a 0. 48 SiO 2 /HA molar ratio, and heat treated at 1250 °C during 2 hours. The fact that silicon stabilizes the α-phase is revealed by the obtaining of this phase while no quench was performed. A grinding process is carried out with the Si-α-TCP prepared to lead to the powder phase for cements. Finally, cement is prepared by mixing a calcium phosphate powder with water. The liquid to powder ratio is also adjusted in order to obtain cements with appropriate properties to be used for bone regeneration. <b>Cement</b> samples are <b>stored</b> under body simulated conditions and are evaluated at different time points. The Si-α-TCP powder reacted with water with similar reaction kinetics than α-TCP powder free of silicon. Furthermore, cements prepared from Si-α-TCP powder have the same physic-chemical properties than cements prepared from α-TCP powder free of silicon. The studies performed were not conclusive on the silicon incorporation into the CDHA, and future studies will be required in order to evaluate this incorporation...|$|R
40|$|In this study, an {{alternative}} fixation technique to affix thin cortical bone fragments to osteosynthesis plates in the surgical therapy of midfacial fractures is presented. The current surgical therapy involves internal fixation in which bone fragments are fixed in their anatomical positions with osteosynthesis plates and corresponding screws until bone healing is complete. This often causes new fractures to fragile bones while drilling pilot holes {{or trying to}} insert screws. The punctually adhesive fixation of osteosynthesis plates using a common cement based on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and methacrylate (MMA) applying through the screw holes of the plate could offer a viable alternative for fixing the plates without screws. However, adhesion forces cannot be built up because of the different wetting properties of the hydrophilic bone and the hydrophobic MMA monomers of the cement. Therefore, a new amphiphilic bone bonding agent was developed, similar in composition to the dentin bonding agents being in clinical use for years, which is able to bond with both hydrophilic bone and hydrophobic MMA monomers of cement. In order to allow the initiation of polymerisation determined individually {{through the use of}} light, as it is desired in the fixation of osteosynthesis plates, the common PMMA cement was modified with a photoinitiator. Osteosynthesis plates with screw holes of 1. 3 mm diameter were punctually fixed to cortical bone samples of bovine femur and also to the cortical cranium of rabbits using the bone bonding agent and the modified lightcuring PMMA <b>cement.</b> After <b>storing</b> the samples up to 8 weeks in a 0. 9 % saline solution at 37 °C in vitro tension tests were implemented {{in order to determine the}} adhesive bonding strengths. For the cortical bone samples of bovine femur bonding strengths of 7. 2 MPa up to 29. 9 MPa were measured. For the cranium of rabbits the bonding strengths were 18. 8 MPa up to 28. 9 MPa. Reference samples, prepared without bone bonding agent, showed 0. 2 MPa or less. Other reference samples were prepared fixing the plates on the cranium of rabbits with screws. The detected average pull out strength was 20. 9 MPa. The results of the present in vitro investigations show that the deleloped amphiphilic bone bonding agent establishes an interlayer between the hydrophilic bone surface and the hydrophobic PMMA cement which results in adhesive bonding between them. The bonding is also stable against hydrolysis. Reference samples confirmed that adhesive bonding between hydrophilic and hydrophobic bonding partners is impossible without the amphiphilic bonding agent. This new method of the adhesive fixing of osteosynthesis plates could have important clinical meaning in cases where conventional fixation of screws and plates find their limitations, as seen in comminuted fractures. With the detected adhesion forces of 7 to 28 MPa, it is to be assumed that the adhesive fixation system is able to secure bone fragments from the non-load bearing midfacial regions in their orthotopic positions until fracture consolidation is complete...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} different surface treatments on shear bond strength between a metallic alloy (Co-Cr-Mo - Remanium CD) and a resin cement (Rely X TM) and to {{evaluate the}} mode of fracture after testing, forty couples of metallic-alloy disks were melted, regularized, polished, submitted to four thermal cycles (Vacuum, 960 ºC, 8 minutes) and randomly separated into four groups. Each group received {{a different type of}} treatment: Group PSP: Polished with sandpaper 600; Group PCP: Polished with sandpaper 600 and application of the metal primer Alloy Primer (Kuraray); Group JSP: Sandblasted with 100 µm aluminum oxide; Group JCP: Sandblasted with 100 mm aluminum oxide and treated with a metal Primer. The groups were <b>cemented</b> and <b>stored</b> in distilled water at 37 ºC for 36 hours and submitted to the shear bond strength test. The mean and standard deviation (in Kgf/cm²) obtained for each group was: PSP 4. 0 / 0. 4; PCP 88. 9 / 33. 6; JSP 163. 2 / 27. 6; JCP 144. 5 / 54. 0. After the statistical analysis the authors concluded that: the highest values were obtained for the sandblasted groups (JSP, JCP), regardless of the primer application; the Alloy Primer increased the retention between the Rely X cement and the polished surface of the Co-Cr-Mo alloy, yet its bond strength was not greater than that obtained with sandblasting; all specimens showed adhesive failures in the tested interface. Para avaliar o efeito de diferentes tratamentos superficiais sobre a resistência ao cisalhamento da união entre uma liga metálica (Co-Cr-Mo - Remanium CD) e um cimento resinoso (Rely X TM) e analisar o tipo de fratura durante a separação dos espécimes, quarenta pares de discos metálicos foram fundidos, regularizados e polidos, submetidos a quatro ciclos térmicos (vácuo, 960 ºC, 8 minutos) e divididos aleatoriamente em quatro grupos. Cada grupo recebeu um tipo de tratamento: Grupo PSP: Polimento com lixa d'água Nº 600; Grupo PCP: Polimento com lixa 600 e aplicação do condicionador metálico Alloy Primer (Kuraray); Grupo JSP: Jato de óxido de alumínio de 100 µm, e Grupo JCP: Jato de óxido de alumínio de 100 mm, e aplicação do Alloy Primer. Os grupos foram cimentados e armazenados em água destilada a 37 ºC por 36 horas e submetidos ao ensaio de resistência ao cisalhamento. A média e o desvio padrão (em kgf/cm²) obtidos para cada grupo foram: PSP 4, 0 / 0, 4; PCP 88, 9 / 33, 6; JSP 163, 2 / 27, 6; JCP 144, 5 / 54, 0. Após a análise estatística os autores concluíram que: os maiores valores foram produzidos pelos grupos jateados (JSP, JCP), independentemente da aplicação do primer; o Alloy Primer aumentou a retentividade entre o cimento Rely X e a superfície polida da liga de Co-Cr-Mo, entretanto sua força de união não superou a alcançada através do jateamento; todos os espécimes apresentaram falha adesiva na interface testada...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Titanium {{has become}} the {{material}} of choice with greater applications in dental implants. The success of the dental implant does not only depend on {{the integration of the}} implant to the bone but also on the function and longevity of the superstructure. The clinical condition that demands long-term interim prosthesis is challenging owing to the decreased bond between the abutment and the veneering material. Hence, various surface treatments are done on the abutments to increase the bond strength. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the bond strength between the abutment and the provisional veneering materials by surface treatments such as acid etching, laser etching, and sand blasting of the abutment. Materials and Methods: Forty titanium alloy abutments of 3 mm diameter and 11 mm height were grouped into four groups with ten samples. Groups A, B, C, and D are untreated abutments, sand blasted with 110 μm aluminum particles, etched with 1 % hydrofluoric acid and 30 % nitric acid, and laser etched with Nd: YAG laser, respectively. Provisional crowns were fabricated with bis-acrylic resin and cemented with noneugenol temporary luting cement. The shear bond strength was measured in universal testing machine using modified Shell–Nielsen shear test after the <b>cemented</b> samples were <b>stored</b> in water at 25 °C for 24 h. Load was applied at a constant cross head speed of 5 mm/min until a sudden decrease in resistance indicative of bond failure was observed. The corresponding force values were recorded, and statistical analysis was done using one-way ANOVA and Newman–Keuls post hoc test. Results: The laser-etched samples showed higher bond strength. Conclusion: Among the three surface treatments, laser etching showed the highest bond strength between titanium alloy implant abutment and provisional restorations. The sand-blasted surfaces demonstrated a significant difference in bond strength compared to laser-etched surfaces. The results of this study confirmed that a combination of surface treatments and bond agents enhances the bond strength...|$|R
