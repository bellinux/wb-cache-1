5|$|However, the Imme {{began to}} develop problems, {{especially}} with the single-sided <b>crankshaft</b> bearings and the freewheel for the kick starter. Riedel corrected the problem beginning with the Model D version, which had a conventional <b>crankshaft</b> with two bearings. However, the profit from sales {{was not enough to}} cover the warranty expenses, and, by the end of 1950, Riedel AG went bankrupt with debts of 1.25millionDeutschmark.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{new engine}} was plagued with problems, such as {{failure of the}} {{accessory}} gear trains and coolant jackets, and several different construction methods were tried before the basic design of the Merlin was set. Early production Merlins were also unreliable: Common problems were cylinder head cracking, coolant leaks, and excessive wear to the camshafts and <b>crankshaft</b> main bearings.|$|E

50|$|<b>Crankshafts</b> can be {{monolithic}} (made in {{a single}} piece) or assembled from several pieces. Monolithic <b>crankshafts</b> are most common, but some smaller and larger engines use assembled <b>crankshafts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{more common}} layout uses two <b>crankshafts,</b> with the <b>crankshafts</b> geared together, or even three geared <b>crankshafts</b> in the Napier Deltic diesel engines. The Deltic uses three <b>crankshafts,</b> one at each corner, {{to form the}} three banks of {{double-ended}} cylinders arranged in an equilateral triangle. These were used in railway locomotives (British built Class 55 and Class 23) and to power fast patrol boats. Both types are now largely obsolete, although the Royal Navy still maintains some Deltic-powered Hunt-class mine countermeasure vessels.|$|R
2500|$|Each eight-cylinder {{bank was}} made up of two cast iron four-cylinder blocks; the <b>crankshafts</b> were each made up of two {{standard}} four-cylinder <b>crankshafts</b> joined end to end by a fine taper cone joint. [...] To reduce overall length, these <b>crankshafts</b> were undercut: a typical Bugatti approach, where only their unlimited budget and attention to detail could afford such complexities.|$|R
5|$|Further {{improvements}} {{were introduced}} throughout the Merlin range: 1943 saw {{the introduction of}} a Bendix-Stromberg pressure carburettor that injected fuel at 5 pounds per square inch (34kPa; 0.34 bar) through a nozzle directly into the supercharger, and was fitted to Merlin 66, 70, 76, 77 and 85 variants. The final development, which was fitted to the 100-series Merlins, was an S.U. injection carburettor that injected fuel into the supercharger using a fuel pump driven as a function of <b>crankshaft</b> speed and engine pressures.|$|E
5|$|The Straight Eight was {{the first}} car in series {{production}} in the United States with a straight-eight engine. The engine had a cast iron block, a detachable cast iron cylinder head, and an aluminum lower crankcase and oil pan. The <b>crankshaft</b> ran in three main bearings. While the prototype Straight Eight shown at the model's introduction had horizontal valves of the type used in earlier Duesenberg-designed marine and racing engines, the model that entered production had a shaft-driven single overhead camshaft which used rockers to operate two valves per cylinder in a hemispheric combustion chamber.|$|E
5|$|Ralf Schumacher {{opened a}} gap of 6.1 seconds over Barrichello by his {{one and only}} pit stop on lap 35 and rejoined in fourth. de la Rosa was the last {{one-stop}} driver to pit on lap 36 from fifth, which he maintained upon rejoining the track. Michael Schumacher made his second pit stop on lap 40, and dropped behind Ralf Schumacher. Montoya moved back into the lead position when Barrichello made a pit stop on lap 41 and rejoined right behind Ralf Schumacher. At the completion of lap 42, with the scheduled pit stops completed, the order was Montoya, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Michael Schumacher, de la Rosa, Villeneuve, Räikkönen, Alesi, Panis, Fisichella, Heidfeld, Bernoldi, Enge, Alonso and Yoong. Further down the field, Enge passed Bernoldi for twelfth on lap 43. Barrichello ran in the slipstream of Ralf Schumacher down the start/finish straight and Schumacher cut the Variante Goodyear chicane after attempting to defend his position, allowing Barrichello to take over second on lap 47. Yoong retired from the race on the same lap after he spun his car into a gravel trap. Bernoldi became the final retirement of the race when his car developed a <b>crankshaft</b> sensor problem on the same lap.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. At present, <b>crankshafts</b> {{with larger}} size are {{finished}} mostly by abrasive cloth and manual steel brush, {{which is not}} ideal on finishing quality, efficiency and cost, especially cleanness degree does not meet design and use request. So horizontal spindle barrel finishing has been developed and has good finishing effects for <b>crankshafts</b> with small size. But this process has bad uniformity for connecting rod journal of <b>crankshafts</b> with larger size by simulation experiments. Aimed at the size, shape and weight of <b>crankshafts</b> with larger size, theoretic research is done, and main factors for finishing uniformity are analyzed. Finally its finishing project is defined and experiments are done. The research indicates that this process is very effective for <b>crankshafts</b> with larger size, and has also positive influence on efficiency and auto product line...|$|R
50|$|<b>Crankshafts</b> can {{be forged}} from a steel bar usually through roll forging or cast in ductile steel. Today {{more and more}} {{manufacturers}} tend to favor the use of forged <b>crankshafts</b> due to their lighter weight, more compact dimensions and better inherent damping. With forged <b>crankshafts,</b> vanadium microalloyed steels are mostly used as these steels can be air cooled after reaching high strengths without additional heat treatment, with exception to the surface hardening of the bearing surfaces. The low alloy content also makes the material cheaper than high alloy steels. Carbon steels are also used, but these require additional heat treatment to reach the desired properties. Iron <b>crankshafts</b> are today mostly found in cheaper production engines (such as {{those found in the}} Ford Focus diesel engines) where the loads are lower. Some engines also use cast iron <b>crankshafts</b> for low output versions while the more expensive high output version use forged steel.|$|R
5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium alloy castings and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with chain-driven single overhead camshafts. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall <b>crankshaft,</b> Daimler or Chevrolet connecting rods and specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is water-cooled, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E
5|$|The Ford Cosworth DFV was {{produced}} by Cosworth in Northampton and {{had been used in}} Formula One since 1967. It is a 2,993cc (183cu in) normally aspirated four-stroke engine with two banks of four cylinders at 90degrees to each other in a 'V8' configuration. It has an aluminium alloy engine block with cylinder liners. Each of its crossflow cylinder heads has a single spark plug and four valves, activated by gear-driven double overhead camshafts. This, combined with the flat-plane <b>crankshaft,</b> provides a relatively simple exhaust layout, in which the exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block. The engine is water-cooled, with water and oil radiators mounted in the left and right sidepods respectively. In 1980, a revised version of the DFV was introduced in which ancillaries such as the water and oil pumps were reduced in size and grouped further forwards on the flanks of the engine to provide more clearance for ground effect tunnels under the cars.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} no records as to the designs of the early steam engines {{produced}} by the Mars Works, Evans's most famous engine design appeared around 1812. Called the Columbian Engine as a patriotic gesture, it {{would prove to be}} the most advanced and successful steam engine design created by Evans—he brought to bear his now extensive experience in designing and building high-pressure steam engines. This horizontally oriented engine allowed the <b>crankshaft</b> and piston rod to work closely together {{at one end of the}} machine, thus reducing the need for a heavy working beam like those required for conventional engines. The piston rod itself was kept working to a straight line while by a new type of linkage wherein two sets of pivoted bars guided the movements of the working bar. This linkage is still known as the Evans straight-line linkage, though it was superseded within a few years by more precise straight line mechanisms. The Columbian was also the culmination of the grasshopper-style of steam engine. Perfected designs like the Columbian saw a popularization of the grasshopper-style and its wide use in a range of applications. In 1813 he made the decision to introduce a condenser to the Columbian design. This significantly cut the running cost to the engine, and at this point his engines were as efficient and powerful as low-pressure Watt-Boulton designs, yet far cheaper to build and smaller in size. Within a year 27 Columbian engines were operating or under construction in applications ranging from sawmilling and grain milling to the manufacturing of paper, wire and wool.|$|E

5|$|Roberts {{announced}} that the 1983 season would be his final year in Grand Prix competition. Yamaha team manager Giacomo Agostini {{had been unable to}} agree on a contract with rider Graeme Crosby, so AMA Superbike champion Eddie Lawson was brought in as Roberts' new teammate. The 1983 battle for the championship between Roberts and Honda's Spencer would be considered one of the greatest seasons in motorcycle Grand Prix history, along with the 1967 500cc duel between Mike Hailwood and Giacomo Agostini. Roberts began the season with his YZR500 having problems with overheating and rear suspension, while Spencer started strongly, winning the first three races and five out of the first seven. Roberts was leading the second race in France, when his Yamaha split an expansion chamber causing it to lose power as Spencer won, with Roberts falling to fourth place. In Round 3 at Monza, Roberts crashed while leading Spencer three laps from the finish. Roberts came back to win the German Grand Prix, but then finished second to Spencer in Spain in a race Spencer called one of the toughest of his career. Things began to go Roberts' way at the Austrian Grand Prix as Roberts won while Spencer's Honda suffered a <b>crankshaft</b> failure. In the Yugoslavian Grand Prix, Roberts' Yamaha failed to start immediately, while Spencer charged to an early lead, leaving Roberts to fight through the field to finish in fourth place. Roberts then went on a three-race winning streak with victories in the Netherlands, Belgium and England, while Spencer stayed close with a third place and two second-place finishes.|$|E
