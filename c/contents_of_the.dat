And then nitrogen control measures such as low-nitrogen steel melting technology, optimization of deoxidization, protective casting technology is raised. After that nitrogen <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aimed steel was reduced and nitrogen absorption during tapping and in <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> after refining to before casting was effectively controlled, nitrogen <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finished steel was stably controlled in 50 × 10 - 6, <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> nitrogen on property of steel is reduced...|$|R

40|$|In “How Facts Make Law” (Greenberg 2004), I {{argue that}} non-normative {{contingent}} facts {{are not sufficient}} to determine <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. In the present paper, I take up a challenge raised by Enrique Villanueva (2005). He suggests that, to put it very briefly, descriptive facts can be reasons. Therefore, even if <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law depends on reasons, {{it does not follow}} that law practices cannot themselves determine <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. Villanueva proposes a value-neutral criterion – textualism. In other words, he suggests that the descriptive facts about <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> legal texts are themselves reasons that determine <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> law practices to <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. This suggestion depends on too shallow a conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> requirement <b>of</b> reasons. For <b>the</b> law to be rationally determined, it is not enough that there be some value-neutral criterion that specifies that law practices have certain consequences for <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. There have to be reasons that explain why that criterion, as opposed to all others, is the legally correct one – the one that, in the relevant legal system, determines <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> law practices to <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. Normative facts are the best candidates for such reasons. And, in fact, Villanueva’s textualist criterion derives its appeal from normative facts. Reasons {{play a central role in}} <b>the</b> ontology <b>of</b> law. <b>The</b> determinants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law, which include law-determining practices such as statutes and judicial decisions, influence <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law in a systematic way. But their influence on <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law cannot be brute: there have to be reasons that explain why the determinants have the particular significance that they have. These reasons are part <b>of</b> what makes <b>the</b> determinants have that significance. Hence, the reasons are part <b>of</b> what makes <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law what it is. Descriptive facts cannot themselves provide the necessary reasons: given any descriptive fact that is a candidate reason, its significance itself depends on reasons – and, unlike normative facts, descriptive facts cannot determine their own significance. Descriptive facts therefore cannot alone determine <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law...|$|R

A positive correlation exists between <b>the</b> amino-acid <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> root and <b>the</b> amino-acid concentration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bleeding sap, but the amino-acid and <b>the</b> sugar <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> root are negatively correlated. 4. Succinic acid given to the root, may act not only as an amino-acid precursor but also as an energy source and as such it may, if sugar is limiting, increase the bleeding rate. 5. <b>The</b> nitrogen source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nutrient solution is important; ammonium increases <b>the</b> amino-acid <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> root more than nitrate does. 6. Both the transpiration stream and the phloem stream influence <b>the</b> amino-acid <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> root; the transpiration stream by transporting amino-acids out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> root and the phloem stream by supplying sugars to the root. 7. Fruiting decreases vegetative growth; the amino-acid and sugar <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> root is decreased in fruiting plants and these facts influence in their turn the amino-acids, transported in the bleeding sap. 8. Environmental conditions, such as <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> light, given to the shoot, the composition and <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> nutrient solution, influence the sugar and keto-acid <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> root and, consequently, the amino-acid content.
