40|$|The {{application}} of ligninolytic fungi and enzymes {{is an option}} to overcome the issues related with the production of biofuels using <b>cotton</b> <b>wastes.</b> In this dissertation, the ligninolytic fungus and enzymes were evaluated as pretreatment for the biochemical conversion of Cotton Gin Trash (CGT) in ethanol and {{as a treatment for}} the transformation of <b>cotton</b> <b>wastes</b> biochar in other substances. In biochemical conversion, seven combinations of three pretreatments (ultrasonication, liquid hot water and ligninolytic enzymes) were evaluated on CGT. The best results were achieved by the sequential combination of ultrasonication, hot water, and ligninolytic enzymes with an improvement of 10 % in ethanol yield. To improve these results, alkaline-ultrasonication was evaluated. Additionally, Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) and principal component analysis (PCA) were employed as fast methodology to identify structural differences in the biomass. The combination of ultrasonication-alkali hydrolysis, hot liquid water, and ligninolytic enzymes using 15 % of NaOH improved 35 % ethanol yield compared with the original treatment. Additionally, FT-IR and PCA identified modifications in the biomass structure after different types of pretreatments and conditions. In thermal conversion, this study evaluated the biodepolymerization of <b>cotton</b> <b>wastes</b> biochar using chemical and biological treatments. The chemical depolymerization evaluated three chemical agents (KMnO 4, H 2 SO 4, and NaOH), with three concentrations and two environmental conditions. The sulfuric acid treatments performed the largest transformations of the biochar solid phase; whereas, the KMnO 4 treatments achieved the largest depolymerizations. The compounds released into the liquid phase were correlated with fulvic and humic acids and silicon compounds. The biological depolymerization utilized four ligninolytic fungi Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Ceriporiopsis subvermispora, Postia placenta, and Bjerkandera adusta. The greatest depolymerization was obtained by C. subvermispora. The depolymerization kinetics of C. subvermispora evidenced the production of laccase and manganese peroxidase and a correlation between depolymerization and production of ligninolytic enzymes. The modifications obtained in the liquid and solid phases showed the production of humic and fulvic acids from the cultures with C. subvermispora. The results of this research are the initial steps for the development of new processes using the ligninolytic fungus and their enzymes for the production of biofuels from <b>cotton</b> <b>wastes...</b>|$|R

The Germans issued their troops with small gauze pads filled with <b>cotton</b> <b>waste,</b> and bottles of a bicarbonate solution with which to dampen the pads. Immediately following the use of chlorine gas by the Germans, instructions were sent to British and French troops to hold wet handkerchiefs or cloths over their mouths. Simple pad respirators similar to those issued to German troops were soon proposed by Lieutenant-Colonel N. C. Ferguson, the A.D.M.S. of the 28th Division. These pads were intended to be used damp, preferably dipped into a solution of bicarbonate kept in buckets for that purpose, though other liquids were also used. Because such pads could not be expected to arrive at the front for several days, army divisions set about making them for themselves. Locally available muslin, flannel and gauze were used, officers were sent to Paris to buy more and local French women were employed making up rudimentary pads with string ties. Other units used lint bandages manufactured in the convent at Poperinge. [...] Pad respirators were sent up with rations to British troops in the line as early as the evening of 24 April.|$|E

In 1913, the company had started making the synthetic fibre viscose rayon, made from cellulose derived from imported wood pulp or <b>cotton</b> <b>waste.</b> Courtaulds in September 1919 bought the old Muspratt Alkali factory in Flint from United Alkali Co Ltd and called it Castle Works, where after conversion they started production in 1922 of manufactured viscose rayon yarn. Courtaulds also in December 1927 bought the Holywell Textile Mill in Flint which they called Deeside Mill and after reconstruction and alterations was used for yarn processing. At its height Courtaulds employed over 10,000 people at four sites. At Greenfield, some [...] further down the Dee estuary, two additional large rayon production facilities existed from 1936 onwards, named Number 1 and Number 2. These mills employed over 3,000 people. Textile production declined from 1950, and Aber works shut initially in 1957, opened for rayon in 1966, and pulled down in 1984. Castle works closed in 1977 and Deeside Mill in 1989. The number 1 facility at Greenfield was mothballed in 1978, and the entire site was decommissioned in the mid 1980s.|$|E

On the other hand, this province is producing huge amounts of solid biomass wastes everyday. Some of them are re-used, but mostly they are land-filled. With innovative, applied research these biomass wastes can be turned into more value added products for the mining industry. For example, wood wastes/saw dust, waste paper and <b>waste</b> <b>cotton</b> are some solid wastes that can easily be converted into high-tech biomaterials (bioadsorbents) for gold recovery from a dilute solution. Those solid wastes are cellulosic, they have a strong affinity to gold when converted to its functional group in a very simple and cheap process. In this project, we have carried out some innovative applied research to produce bioadsorbents derived from solid biomass wastes, such as <b>waste</b> paper, <b>waste</b> <b>cotton</b> and <b>waste</b> wood/saw dust, which are abundantly available in this province and need proper management to increase their life-cycle.
