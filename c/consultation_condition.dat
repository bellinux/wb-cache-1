40|$|This study {{examines}} whether adding psychologically focused group consulta-tion {{to a standard}} 1 -day continuing-education workshop on Group Drug Counseling (GDC), a group therapy with evidence of effectiveness {{in the treatment of}} substance abuse problems, improves GDC adoption. Counselors who had taken a 1 -day workshop were randomly assigned to an 8 -week course of group consultation that met for 1. 5 hr per session (n 16) or to no addi-tional contact (n 14). The group con-sultation used Relapse Prevention and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy principles to help participants over-come psychological barriers to the adoption of GDC. Results showed that the 1 -day workshop resulted in attempts by trainees to implement the new ther-apy, but that the <b>consultation</b> <b>condition</b> maintained significantly higher levels of adoption and 2 - and 4 -month follow-ups. Additionally, those in the group <b>consultation</b> <b>condition</b> reported a higher sense of personal accomplish-ment at the 4 -month followup.

40|$|Abstract Background This paper details a {{model for}} {{consulting}} with mothers and infants, and drug treatment staff used in a residential drug treatment program and relevant to other treatment settings. The role of parent-infant consultation based on the Neonatal Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) was evaluated. Methods A sequential cohort model was used to assign participants to 1. NNNS consultation versus 2. standard care. The effects of NNNS consultation were evaluated using the Parenting Stress Index and NNNS summary scores. Results Participants in the NNNS <b>consultation</b> <b>condition</b> had significantly less stress overall, and less stress related to infant behavior than participants in standard care. There were no differences in infant behavior on the NNNS Summary scores. Conclusion The implications for NNNS consultation in drug treatment programs is outlined. The importance of prevention/intervention to establish satisfactory mother-infant interaction in recovery programs which include a central parenting component is indicated. </p...|$|E

Construct validity of func-tional behavioral assessment (FBA) was assessed with a multifunction-multimethod matrix that showed excellent convergent and divergent agreement with combined FBA methods and functional analysis results.

The efficiency of teachers ’ implementation effected treatment validity. Effect sizes showed that regardless of treatment condition that interventions with good fidelity realized the largest effect (d 1. 14). Social and habilitative validity was assessed with telephone interviews conducted a year after treatment. Sixty-five percent attributed the students’ problem behaviors to their thoughts or feelings, whereas only 25 % attributed it to classroom variables.

30|$|We {{believe that}} the {{classification}} of the data above shows {{significant differences in the}} degree of property rights protection during the process of mergers and reorganizations. These differences are most clearly demonstrated between the first category and fourth category. In the first category, the campaign led to the shutting down of privately run coal mines, indicating that privately run coal mines received rather poor property rights protection. Firstly, private coal mines in these provinces were not only deprived of industry access, but they had to face either closure or merger with a state-owned coal mine. Secondly, concerning price valuation and compensation, since the owners of privately run coal mines did not have any choice in the matter, they did not receive the same kind of <b>consultation</b> <b>conditions</b> as government or state-owned coal mines did. Hence, it was difficult for them to achieve a fair valuation price or to obtain reasonable compensation.|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} was conducted primarily {{to determine whether}} making the problem solving process more overt to consultees increased consultees 2 ̆ 7 ability to learn behavior modeled during initial consultation sessions. Secondarily, the effect of enhancing consultees 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of consultants 2 ̆ 7 expertise was also examined. Subjects were 195 college undergraduate women {{randomly assigned to one}} of six treatment conditions. Subjects viewed videotapes of one of three types of consultation conditions: (a) traditional consultation, (b) process overt consultation, or (c) irrelevant <b>consultation</b> (control <b>condition).</b> Consultant expertise was manipulated by varying the consultants 2 ̆ 7 introductions. Consultants received either an enhanced or nonenhanced introduction. Ability to define children 2 ̆ 7 s problems in behavioral terms and to describe the process for defining children 2 ̆ 7 s classroom problems constituted the dependent variables for this study. ^ Data analyses indicated that subjects exposed to process overt consultation were able to write problem definitions which were significantly more behavioral than subjects in either the traditional <b>consultation</b> or control <b>conditions.</b> Results also indicated that significantly more subjects in the process overt and traditional <b>consultation</b> <b>conditions</b> than in the control condition provided goals for the child 2 ̆ 7 s behavior as part of their problem definitions. In addition, it was found that as the problem solving process was made more overt, subjects were significantly better able to describe the process for defining children 2 ̆ 7 s problems. No significant differences were found between level of consultant expertise on any of the dependent variables. ^ Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. Most importantly, data from this study provide support for the preventive component of consultation. Results indicate that consultee 2 ̆ 7 s problem solving behavior can be modified through exposure to consultation, particularly process overt consultation. The results strongly suggest that the use of overt process statements during initial consultation sessions is an effective approach for helping consultees learn process skills and apply these skills when attempting to identify or define students 2 ̆ 7 needs. Limitations of the study and suggestions for further research are also discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To develop {{explanations}} for the quantitative findings of an RCT by systematically interrogating data from the nested qualitative study. Design: Qualitative study (narrative interviews and framework analysis) nested within an RCT. Participants: A total of 27 RCT participants were purposively selected to interview, to encompass all treatment conditions. Setting: The single-blind RCT examined the efficacy of real acupuncture for pain relief in hip and knee osteoarthritis. Patients were randomised to 3 treatment conditions (real acupuncture vs 2 placebo treatments) and 2 <b>consultation</b> <b>conditions</b> (empathic vs non-empathic). The study involved 3 experienced acupuncturists who delivered all interventions. Findings: Interviewees were active participants who sought to make meaning of their experiences in the trial. They wanted to try acupuncture and thought it might benefit them, thus subverting patient equipoise. Interviewees sought {{to determine whether they}} were receiving real treatment and drew on cues including perceived outcomes, treatment sensations, and practitioner behaviours. Evidence for a reciprocal process is outlined in which interviewees’ perceptions of treatment veracity and outcomes were mutually reinforcing. The most successful practitioner was seen as an authoritative doctor. Interviewees reported colluding with practitioners in non-empathic consultations, and inferred empathy from experiences associated with the trial but outside the protocol treatments. Conclusions: This nested qualitative analysis offered novel insights into the RCT findings {{that would not have been}} possible from the quantitative data alone. Conceptualising and understanding RCT subjects as active participants has important implications for trial design particularly for interventions such as acupuncture when equipoise is unlikely. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Research into {{acupuncture}} {{has shown}} that individuals continue to report favourable clinical effects {{despite the lack of}} systematic evidence supporting a point specific therapeutic effect for real acupuncture treatment. This thesis presents a qualitative study, nested within a large randomised controlled trial of acupuncture specifically designed to investigate both specific and non-specific effects of western acupuncture for osteoarthritis pain. The aim was to explore the non specific effects of acupuncture in a trial context from the participants’ perspective, in particular the therapeutic relationship and any additional influences on the patient experience that might lead to non-specific effects on outcomes. Participants were recruited from hip or knee joint replacement waiting lists and randomised to one of three treatments (real acupuncture or 2 placebo controls) and one of two <b>consultation</b> <b>conditions</b> (empathic or non- empathic). The qualitative methodology was grounded theory. Data collection combined 27 post trial audio taped, semi structured interviews with post treatment debriefing, participant and non participant observation and personal reflections. The findings of this study identified a core category of ‘forging a conviction’ and a substantive theory of ‘active trial participation’ was developed. Participants gave reasons for entering the trial and for maintaining their commitment to it, despite numerous barriers. These experiences helped to forge convictions about the trial interventions and their effects. As a result a combination of specific and non specific influences appeared to impact on the participants’ reporting of outcomes, leading to discrepancies between the quantitative and qualitative data. This theory of ‘active participation’ in clinical trials challenges some of the basic assumptions of randomized controlled trials, most notably that participants are passive recipients of an intervention and report its effects factually.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} a UK-based {{ethnography}} of prenatal screening for Down’s syndrome across two hospitals. By studying the mundane and routine practices of the clinic, I initially capture how Down’s syndrome screening is organised and how its sedimentation as a taken-for-granted aspect of pregnancy contributes to the procedure being ‘downgraded’. This downgrading accomplishes hierarchies of valued/valueless work and professional specialities and also, therefore, of certain professional identities. In what follows, I explore the conduct of care and how professionals detach from Down’s syndrome screening by assigning responsibility for decision-making to parents-to-be. Professionals’ devotion to the rhetoric of ‘informed choice’ and ‘non-directive care’ also naturalises screening as a ‘normal’ part of pregnancy, this routinisation being extended by parents-to-be (often with professionals) privileging the ‘social’ rather than ‘medical’ dimension of ultrasound scanning. I continue by analysing how Down’s syndrome itself is constituted {{both inside and outside}} screening encounters. During <b>consultations,</b> the <b>condition</b> is rarely discussed and is substituted with dominant discourses of ‘risk’, ‘problem’, and ‘abnormality’. The condition is subsequently constructed as a negative pregnancy outcome. This intersects with the production and reproduction of ideas around perfection in the social practices and cultural materials of the clinic and how, if a diagnosis is established, the unborn ‘baby’ is recast as a ‘foetus’. By making this move, the unborn baby is denied personhood and a termination of pregnancy is made possible. To conclude, I highlight how the routine practice of prenatal screening for Down’s syndrome has transformed antenatal medicine, invigorated parental expectations, shaped issues around reproductive politics, and cultivated certain body-society relations...|$|R
40|$|The {{delivery}} of school psychological services has {{in recent years}} centered increasingly on the consultative role. The implementation of the consultative approach {{in the school setting}} can be greatly facilitated by a variety of psychologist-initiated activities. Inservice training for teachers is one extremely valuable tool in this regard for the development of skills necessary for effective consultation and implementation of classroom-based intervention plans. It was {{the purpose of this study}} to evaluate the relative effectiveness of two teacher training packages under two analogue <b>consultation</b> dependent measure <b>conditions</b> in a 2 x 2 completely randomized factorial design. Subjects included 56 elementary school teachers in the Amphitheater School District in Tucson, Arizona. The packages evaluated focused on (1) training in classroom behavior modification and consultation, and (2) training in consultative service delivery procedures and general multidisciplinary team process (a non-specific training control). The analogue <b>consultation</b> dependent measure <b>conditions</b> included (1) specific and (2) general Problem Identification, Problem Analysis, and Problem Evaluation behavioral consultation elicitors. The effectiveness of these training packages was evaluated relative to knowledge of behavior modification principles and concepts, and relative to the frequency of specific categories of consultee verbal behaviors (Bergan, 1977). The results of this study suggest that the experimental training package was effective in increasing teacher knowledge of behavioral procedures. This training was also found to be effective in increasing the frequency of teacher verbalizations regarding overt child behaviors, behavioral observation techniques, and behavioral intervention plans during the Problem Identification and Problem Analysis phases of analogue consultation. It was found that even after training, specific consultant questions were important in eliciting consultee statements related to environmental conditions surrounding behavior. The use of more general types of consultant verbal behaviors, on the other hand, resulted in significantly more vague, unspecified, and irrelevant types of consultee verbalizations. Consultee training should be an integral part of the school consultation process. The results of this study indicate that teacher training in the skills necessary for effective identification, analysis, intervention, and evaluation of child learning and behavior problems in the classroom is a very viable approach...|$|R
40|$|Aims: The primary {{aim of this}} randomised-controlled {{trial was}} to {{evaluate}} the effect of an exercise <b>consultation</b> (experimental <b>condition)</b> compared with standard exercise information (control condition) on maintenance of physical activity six and 12 months following completion of a phase III hospital-based exercise programme. Secondary aims included assessing the effect of an exercise consultation compared with exercise information on physiological and psychological variables at six and 12 months. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the exercise consultation was more effective than exercise information in maintaining self-reported physical activity for 12 months after completion of a phase III exercise programme. However, the change in CSA accelerometer readings over the 12 -month study period did not parallel the significant decrease in self-reported physical activity observed in the control group. The exercise consultation was not effective in maintaining exercise capacity for 12 months after completion of phase III. Significant decreases in peak VO 2 from baseline to 12 months were observed in both groups. In contrast, an improvement in the VO 2 at the lactate threshold, which is an index of submaximal endurance capacity, was recorded {{in the experimental group}} compared to the control group from baseline to follow-up. Finally, the exercise consultation had no significant effect on processes of exercise behaviour change, lipid profile and psychological function. These variables were normal at baseline and were maintained over the study period in both groups. The results of this study demonstrate that the exercise consultation may be an effective intervention for maintaining physical activity after completion of phase III hospital-based exercise programmes. The exercise consultation is a minimal intervention that could be delivered by physiotherapists to patients at the end of phase III or by British Association of Cardiac Rehabilitation (BACR) trained exercise instructors to patients in phase IV.

A study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of two brief multi-strategic child health nurse delivered interventions in: decreasing the prevalence of infants exposed to SHS; decreasing the prevalence of smoking amongst parent/carers of infants and increasing the prevalence of household smoking bans. Methods: This study was a 3 arm, cluster randomised controlled trial. Clusters were 39 community based well child health clinics in one local area health service. Clinics were stratified according to annual number of client appointments and then randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio, (Intervention 1 : Intervention 2 : Control), with 13 clinics in each cluster. Parents/carers of infants in the intervention groups received a brief multi-strategic intervention from child health nurses during clinic <b>consultations.</b> Treatment <b>condition</b> 1 included computer delivered risk assessment and feedback and nurse brief advice. Treatment condition 2 included all elements of Treatment condition 1 {{with the addition of}} biochemical feedback of infant SHS exposure. Results: When compared to the Control group at 12 months, no significant differences in the prevalence of infant exposure to SHS were detected from baseline to follow-up for Treatment condition 1 (OR 1. 16, 95 % CI 0. 73 – 1. 85, p = 0. 53) or Treatment condition 2 (OR 1. 30, 95 % CI 0. 88 – 1. 92, p = 0. 19) Similarly, no significant differences were detected in the proportion of parent/carers who reported that they were smokers (T 1 :OR 0. 95, 95 % CI 0. 78 – 1. 15, p = 0. 58 and T 2 :OR 0. 97, 95 % CI 0. 80 – 1. 18, p = 0. 77), or in the proportion of households reported to have a complete smoking ban (T 1 :OR 1. 21, 95 % CI 0. 89 – 1. 64, p = 0. 23 and T 2 :OR 1. 06, 95 % CI 0. 79 – 1. 43, p = 0. 68).

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} primary care {{in the management of}} HIV and estimate primary care-associated costs at a time of rising prevalence. Methods: Retrospective cohort study between 1995 and 2005, using data from general practices contributing data to the UK General Practice Research Database. Patterns of consultation and morbidity and associated consultation costs were analysed among all practice-registered patients for whom HIV-positive status was recorded in the general practice record. Results: 348 practices yielded 5504 person-years (py) of follow-up for known HIV-positive patients, who consult in general practice frequently (4. 2 consultations/py by men, 5. 2 consultations/py by women, in 2005) for a range of <b>conditions.</b> <b>Consultation</b> rates declined in the late 1990 s from 5. 0 and 7. 3 consultations/py in 1995 in men and women, respectively, converging to rates similar to the wider population. Costs of consultation (general practitioner and nurse, combined) reflect these changes, at £ 100. 27 for male patients and £ 117. 08 for female patients in 2005. Approximately one in six medications prescribed in primary care for HIV-positive individuals has the potential for major interaction with antiretroviral medications. Conclusion: HIV-positive individuals known in general practice now consult on a similar scale to the wider population. Further research should be undertaken to explore how primary care can best contribute to improving the health outcomes of this group with chronic illness. Their substantial use of primary care suggests there may be potential to develop effective integrated care pathways...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Nurses {{increasingly}} manage {{acute illness}} in United Kingdom (UK) general practice. Few data exist about patients routinely consulting with these nurses. There are concerns that providing this additional service will lower thresholds for consulting {{with an overall}} increase in workload. Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is the commonest reason for consulting. Inappropriate antibiotics promote resistant bacteria. Nurse management of URTI is an ideal opportunity to promote self-care and nonantibiotic management. AIMS: To describe {{the effects of a}} specially trained practice nurse managing URTI in a general practice in Cardiff, UK. METHODS: Descriptive study. RESULTS: Data were collected on 132 patients consulting with the nurse. We also collected data on 234 patients consulting general practitioners (GPs) in the same practice. Patients seen by the nurse were younger and less likely to be given antibiotics {{at the time of their}} index illness than those who saw GPs (7 % vs. 93 %; P < 0. 001). During the year following the consultation with the nurse, patients consulted slightly less often and received antibiotics for URTI less often compared with the year preceding this consultation (P= 0. 02). Their consultation rate for all conditions did not change. The consultation rates for URTI of the patients managed by the GPs remained constant and <b>consultations</b> for all <b>conditions</b> increased (P < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Nurse management of URTI did not lower patients' threshold for future consulting, and patients who saw her were prescribed antibiotics less often...|$|R
40|$|Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the intensity of previously experienced labor pains in the context of self-evaluated intensity of discopathy-related low back pain in female patients. Participants and procedure The retrospective study included 57 women who received neurosurgical <b>consultation</b> under ambulatory <b>conditions.</b> The intensity of low back pain experienced by every patient was scored using the 11 -grade Numeric Rating Scale (NRS- 11; ranging from 0 to 10 points). Simultaneously, an obstetrical history was collected from every patient (year of delivery, intensity of labor pain assessed with NRS- 11). Results Overall, 57 women, aged between 27 and 88 years (mean 52. 8 ± 15. 6 years), were examined. The age at delivery ranged between 17 and 35 years (mean 25. 6 ± 5. 6 years). The patient-reported intensity of pain in the lumbosacral spine, assessed with NRS- 11, ranged between 5 and 10 points (mean 7. 9 ± 1. 7 points), while the intensity of labor pain ranged between 3 and 10 points (mean 8. 6 ± 1. 9 points). Labor pain was perceived as more significantly intense than low back pain localized in the lumbosacral spine. In four cases (7 %), the intensity of low back pain was re-scored upon asking about the intensity of previous labor pain. Conclusions Labor pain experienced during full-term vaginal delivery is characterized by significantly higher intensity as compared to low back pain. The memory of pain experienced during previous labors can attenuate the intensity of discopathy-related low back pain...|$|R
40|$|AbstractChronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is a disease}} state characterized by chronic airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, with a precise definition varying between different management guidelines. The burden of COPD is considerable from all relevant viewpoints. From the perspective of society, the mortality is already considerable, {{and it is likely}} to increase from the sixth to the third most common cause of death worldwide by 2020. From the patient's perspective, COPD is responsible for disability that restricts many everyday activities, such as walking up stairs. The burden of COPD on physicians includes increasing <b>consultations</b> for the <b>condition.</b> From the perspective of healthcare payers, COPD represents an increasing burden, primarily due to the costs incurred when exacerbations require hospital treatment. Despite this considerable burden, there are many signs that the impact of COPD is not recognized. Research on COPD is currently underfunded in relation to the impact of the disease; patients only present late with symptoms; physicians may fail to diagnose the condition and healthcare payers may be failing to support treatment approaches that could reduce the number of costly hospital exacerbations. Reasons for this overall poor recognition of the burden of COPD include lack of recognition of the disease, difficulties in diagnosis, poor knowledge of COPD and nihilistic attitudes towards the condition and its treatment. Awareness of COPD could be improved with education of the public and healthcare professionals. Long-term epidemiological studies showing the impact on morbidity and mortality of different treatment approaches would also influence the setting of priorities by healthcare payers...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} health and {{environmental}} concerns of parents living close to opencast coal mines in the UK and characterises parental risk perceptions in relation to children's asthma status. This qualitative research was undertaken in tandem with an epidemiological investigation aiming to establish whether opencast coal mining adversely affected children's respiratory health. Using a social construction approach, the centrality of health claims in environmental health disputes becomes apparent {{for a number of}} claims-makers. We focus on claims of non-activist participants in an epidemiological study, hitherto unknown and unexplored. In all but one case health claims were anticipated rather than realised. No link was found between children's asthma and exacerbation of the condition although some parents of children with asthma had greater concerns during the opencast planning stage. In fact, parents' discourses on children's health largely mirrored the epidemiological findings which showed increased dust, no increase in asthma prevalence but higher rates of general practitioner (GP) <b>consultations</b> for respiratory <b>conditions</b> suggesting that the commonly observed lack of convergence between lay and expert knowledge should not be taken for granted. In spite of this overall lack of an experienced health effect, the sociological data highlight respondents' recognition of the place-specificity of exposures, hence, the reasons why opencast proposals are likely to continue to be met with opposition. Environmental health studies which incorporate epidemiological and social approaches simultaneously {{have a better chance of}} arriving at conclusions meaningful to affected communities and facilitate greater understanding of environmental disputes.

40|$|Background and Objective: Chest pain is {{a common}} and {{important}} admission complaint of patients in the emergency department (ED). The differential diagnosis {{especially in terms of}} acute coronary syndrome (ACS) should be done carefully by emergency physicians. The present study aims to identify patients with chest pain according to presence of ACS in the ED. Material and Methods: The patients who admitted to the ED of a university hospital in a year period with chest pain complaint were enrolled into the study prospectively. The information that include age, gender, type of chest pain, duration of pain, medical history, transporting way to the ED, duration time of electrocardiography (ECG) recording, main diagnosis, <b>consultation</b> status, last <b>condition</b> of patients and length of stay of patients were recorded. The data were analyzed by SPSS 17. 0 program. Results: Totally 325 patients with chest pain complaint were enrolled into the study. 24. 3 % of patients with chest pain were diagnosed as ACS. It was found that most of the patients (42. 5 %) came to ED by the ambulance. 110 (33. 8 %) of 325 patients with chest pain were consulted with cardiologists. The older age was found to be related with ACS significantly (p< 0. 001). Additionally; compressive, burning and squeezing types of chest pain were associated with ACS (p< 0. 040). The length of stay in the ED was found shorter in ACS+ group than ACS- group (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: The presented study indicates the role of emergency physicians on the management of patients with chest pain. The early and true diagnosis of patients is very important and essential particularly for the management of ACS in the ED. [J Contemp Med 2016; 6 (1. 000) : 30 - 34...|$|R
40|$|Cardiac tachyarrhythmias are {{recurrent}} {{or chronic}} {{and in some}} cases life-threatening conditions. Heart rhythm disturbances are often highly symptomatic and the psychological impact of the disease can be significant. Patients 2 ̆ 7 beliefs and knowledge about their health (and illness), medications, and healthcare they receive are important determinants of whether or not they accept recommended treatments; influence their coping responses to their illness and treatment; adherence to recommended therapy; and ultimately affects health outcomes. Incorporation of patients 2 ̆ 7 values and preferences for therapy should now be considered {{as an integral part of}} the decision-making process and treatment strategy. It is important to acknowledge and understand the impact of cardiac tachyarrhythmias on the patient. To address this issue, a Task Force was convened by the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), and endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), Asia-Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS), and Sociedad Latinoamericana de Estimulación Cardíaca y Electrofisiología (SOLEACE), with the remit to comprehensively review the published evidence available, to publish a joint consensus document on patient values and preferences for the management of cardiac tachyarrhythmias, and to provide up-to-date consensus recommendations for use in clinical practice. Hence this unique consensus document focuses on patients, summarizing the available literature on patients 2 ̆ 7 experiences of living with various cardiac tachyarrhythmias and their treatment preferences, and identifies gaps in knowledge which will help to inform clinical practice and future research. The document will also summarize key points for discussions with patients during <b>consultations</b> regarding their <b>condition,</b> treatment options, disease trajectory, treatment goals, and outcomes. Finally, this document provides links to useful resources and patient advocacy groups and organizations and professional societies relevant to each group of cardiac tachyarrhythmias...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{answer the}} {{question}} whether living near opencast coal mining sites affects acute and chronic respiratory health.  METHODS—All 4860  children aged 1 - 11 from five socioeconomically matched pairs of communities close to active opencast sites and control sites away from them were selected. Exposure was assessed by concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 10 µm (PM 10), residential proximity to active opencast sites, and particle composition. PM 10 was monitored and sampled for 6  weeks in four pairs, and for 24  weeks in one pair. A postal questionnaire collected data on health and lifestyle. Daily health information was collected by a symptom diary (concurrently with PM 10 monitoring) and general practitioner (GP) records were abstracted (concurrently with PM 10 monitoring and 52  weeks before the study). Outcomes were the cumulative and period prevalence (2  and 12  months) of wheeze, asthma, bronchitis, and other respiratory symptoms, and the prevalence and incidence of daily symptoms and GP consultations.  RESULTS—Patterns of the daily variation of PM 10 were similar in opencast and control communities, but PM 10 was higher in opencast areas (mean ratio 1. 14,  95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 13  to 1. 16, geometric mean 17. 0  µg/m 3 v 14. 9  µg/m 3). Opencast sites were a measurable contributor to PM 10 in adjacent areas. Little evidence was found for associations between living near an opencast site and an increased prevalence of respiratory illnesses, asthma severity, or daily diary symptoms, but children in opencast communities 1 - 4 had significantly more respiratory consultations (1. 5  v 1. 1  per person-year) than children in control communities for the 6  week study periods. Associations between daily PM 10 concentrations and acute health events were similar in opencast and control communities.  CONCLUSIONS—Children in opencast communities were exposed to a small but significant amount of additional PM 10 to which the opencast sites were a measurable contributor. Past and present respiratory health of children was similar, but GP <b>consultations</b> for respiratory <b>conditions</b> were higher in opencast communities during the core study period.    Keywords: opencast coal mining; respiratory health; PM 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis are the Stroke and the Protocol of a Stroke for Emergency Medical Services of the South Bohemian Region. The teoretical {{part of this}} thesis {{includes}} basic anathomy and pathophysiology facts of brain necessary for understanding of a cerebrovascular accident. Afterwards the chapters {{are focused on the}} CVA itself. First of all are described the definition and a basic division of Strokes. In the next chapter are described possible high-risk factors leading to an inception of a cerebrovascular accident. The following topic is the Clinical Picture of Ischemic and Hemorrhaging CVA, diagnostic method used in a hospital facility. The important chapter is the therapy of a cerebrovascular accident in a preliminary medical care, there is also described the Protocol of a Stroke and potential patient's aiming to an acute medical treatment. The two last chapters are focused on a hospital medical treatement and after-care. The intention of this thesis is the maping of theoretical knowledge and differences in application of the Protocol of a Stroke aplicated by paramedics and nurses working in the Emergency Medical Service of the South Bohemian Region. We also wanted to evaulate a cooperation with Stroke Centers that can help to get the patient to undergo a medical performance as fast as it is possible which is essential for the patient and improves many times a future quality of life. Practical part tooks place by the method of a qualitative research. There were used semi-structured interviews with paramedics and nurses employed by Emergency Medical Services of the South Boheminan Region. The interviews included twelve questions concerning theoretical knowledge about the Cerebrovascular Accident, knowledge of the Stroke Protocol and filling in of of it, evaulation of co-operation and a telephonic consultation with Stroke Centers in the South Bohemian Region. Furthermore there was led a semi-structured interview with the doctor of the Complex Cerebrovascular Centre in České Budějovice and with the doctor of the Stroke Centre in Písek. The interviews consited of five questions concerning primarily a frequency of occurrence of the Stroke Protocol during the submittig of the patient and the evaulation of the <b>consultation</b> of patient's <b>condition</b> using the Stroke Telephone. Transcribed interviews are the component of practical part. The evaulated answers were catalogued into the charts for a better arrangement and orientation...|$|R
