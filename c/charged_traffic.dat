30|$|With these pricing {{policies}} in mind, let us study the charges for V M I 1. Of concern to us here is traffic consumption and resource consumption.

In addition, V M I 1 will be <b>charged</b> for <b>traffic</b> (Data Transfer–In and Data Transfer–Out) consumed on the channel that links V M I 1 {{to the client}} application, as the latter is outside the Amazon cloud. There are no <b>charges</b> for the <b>traffic</b> consumed by the interaction against E B S 1 as the traffic consumed by the interaction between VMIs and EBSs is free.

50|$|The Government of Mongolia {{does not}} fully comply with the minimum {{standards}} {{for the elimination of}} trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government sustained partnerships with NGOs on anti-trafficking prevention measures.

The government’s lack of adequate guidance {{on the use of the}} country’s amended anti-trafficking article of law continues to cause courts to <b>charge</b> <b>trafficking</b> offenders under a lesser offense, resulting in shorter sentences. Corruption remains a key barrier to anti-trafficking progress.|$|R
