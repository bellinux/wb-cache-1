The commonly used models in engineering practices are the Winkler’s model, elastic half space model and finite <b>compressible</b> <b>layer</b> model. Among these models, the finite <b>compressible</b> <b>layer</b> model is widely used in the designing of raft foundation. As the finite <b>compressible</b> <b>layer</b> model can not reflect {{the nature of the}} in situ soil and the nonlinear settlement, in this paper we try to modify the elastic modulus E by the secant modulus in order to improve the soil model of finite <b>compressible</b> <b>layer...</b>|$|E

It has suffered serious groundwater drawdown and land subsidence due to groundwater exploitation. This study aimed to introduce geographical distribution measure methods into land subsidence research characterizing, geographically, land subsidence, groundwater drawdown, and <b>compressible</b> <b>layer</b> thickness. Therefore, we used gravity center analysis and standard deviational ellipse (SDE) methods in GIS to statistically analyze their concentration tendency, principle orientation, dispersion trend, and distribution differences in 1995 (1999), 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013. Results show {{that they were all}} concentrated in Chaoyang District of Urban Beijing. The concentration trend of land subsidence was consistent with that of groundwater drawdown. The principle orientation of land subsidence was SW–NE, which was more similar with that of the static spatial distribution of the <b>compressible</b> <b>layer.</b> The dispersion tendency of land subsidence got closer to that of the <b>compressible</b> <b>layer</b> with its increasing intensity. The spatial distribution difference between land subsidence and groundwater drawdown was about 0. 2, and that between land subsidence and <b>compressible</b> <b>layer</b> thickness it decreased from 0. 22 to 0. 07, reflecting that the spatial distribution pattern of land subsidence was increasingly close to that of the <b>compressible</b> <b>layer.</b> Results of this study are useful for assessing the distribution of land subsidence development and managing groundwater resources...|$|E

40|$|The {{technical}} {{focus of}} this doctoral thesis:"Experimental Research of a <b>Compressible</b> Shock-Shear <b>Layer</b> Interaction in Supersonic Flows", is a Scramjet engine. This is a Ramjet engine in which fuel is injected, mixed and burned in a supersonic air flow. Supersonic combustion in a Ramjet is necessary for a fight velocity higher than Mach number M = 5. This thesis deals with supersonic mixing. Supersonic <b>compressible</b> shear <b>layers</b> {{and the influence of}} shocks on shear layers were experimentally investigated. The Scramjet combustion chamber model has a central fuel injection element, which injects hydrogen gas with a Mach number M = 2 parallel to the supersonic air flow. In this investigation the air flow was accelerated to the Mach number M = 2. The <b>compressible</b> supersonic shear <b>layers</b> were investigated using the following measurement methods: Schlieren optics, pitot tubes, Laser-Two-Focus system (L 2 F), Laser-Induced-Fluorescence (LIF) and Rayleigh scattering. The convective Mach number Mc, a characteristic number for <b>compressible</b> shear <b>layers</b> in supersonic flows, was varied in the range from Mc = 0, 7 to 1, 34. The compressible growth rate was normalized with the incompressible growth rate of the shear layer. The experiment shows, that the normalized growth rate of the <b>compressible</b> shear <b>layer</b> strongly decreases with increasing convective Mach number and that the normalized growth rate moves toward 0, 3. Similar to the incompressible shear <b>layers,</b> the <b>compressible</b> shear <b>layer</b> also shows big vortex structures. These structures were compressed and stretched vertically with increasing convective Mach numbers. Defined shocks with different strengths were induced on the <b>compressible</b> shear <b>layer</b> with a wedge on the upper model combustion chamber, and the shock-shear layer interaction was investigated. Shocks locally improve the mixing near the interaction zone in the <b>compressible</b> shear <b>layer.</b> With a shock-shear layer interaction the normalized growth rate increased up to + 50 %.

Piles installed through soft <b>compressible</b> soil <b>layers</b> are subjected to Negative Skin Friction (NSF) as a result of consolidation of the soft <b>compressible</b> <b>layers</b> due to placing fills, lowering of the ground water table, pile driving etc. The NSF, or commonly referred to as the drag force, is generally estimated from the skin frictional resistance due to the consolidating layer and layers above it. However, it is shown by the researchers [Bjerrum et al. (1969) and Endo et al. (1969) ] that the NSF is not developed up {{to the bottom of the}} consolidating layer but only upto a point, referred as the neutral point, above the bottom of the consolidating layer. Moreover, the results of full scale field tests conducted by researchers clearly indicates that the development ofNSF is not due to the total stress but due to the effective stress acting on the pile shaft. Moreover, it is experimentally shown that the development of the ultimate NSF requires very small relative displacement between the pile and the soil. Furthermore, it is experimentally shown that the action of short-term live loads reduces the developed NSF. Therefore, the NSF and short-term live loads are not simultaneously acting on the pile...|$|R

This paper discusses the performance of ground improvement by pre-compression and vertical drain implemented {{for the construction of}} permanent campus of Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP) in Kuala Pahang, Pekan. The comparison was made in terms of engineering properties of the soil such as shear strength and compressibility characteristics before and after improvement and the achievement of criteria in terms of time and post construction settlement. The soil investigation showed that subsoil profile consisted of four layers whereby the thickness of <b>compressible</b> <b>layer</b> varies from 6 to 14 m. Settlement monitoring showed that the required pre-construction settlement was achieved in less than six months after the completion of ground improvement by pre-compression. Installation of the vertical in swampy area further reduced the consolidation time to about one month. The undrained shear strength (Su) of the soft <b>compressible</b> <b>layer</b> increased from 6 - 30 kPa to about 67 kPa while the compression index (Cc) decreased from about 0. 2 - 0. 6 to about 0. 33.

The applicability of the hyperbolic form as a representation of the settlement-time response of sabkha soils was further ascertained by analyzing settlement records measured under the center of an instrumented test embankment. The laboratory test results indicated that the experimental settlement-time response could reasonably be represented by the rectangular hyperbolic relationship. The settlements determined as the inverse of the initial portion multiplied by the slope of the theoretical curve underestimated the total settlements because of the prominent secondary compression behavior of the tested sabkha soil. However, the inverse of the slope of the final linear segment gave excellent estimates of the total settlements.

This project aims at the investigation of the transition process in <b>compressible</b> boundary <b>layers</b> at transonic Mach numbers. For this, direct numerical simulations of spatially growing disturbances in <b>compressible</b> boundary <b>layers</b> are used. The numerical methods for the solution of the 3 D Navier-Stokes equations have been developed in project LFK 8611 / 3. The transition development initiated by different types of disturbances at Mach numbers up to 1. 6 has been simulated and explored. For subsonic Mach numbers (up to 0. 8) we observed similar evolutions as for incompressible boundary layers. For supersonic Mach numbers (M= 1. 6), a new type of breakdown to turbulence initiated by only a pair of oblique waves was found that was not observed before in other investigations.

The obtained results are compared with those obtained from ERS/ENVISAT data belonging to the same period and validated with pre-existing information. Subsidence data reveal average rates of subsidence for the whole area up to − 5 mm/year with local values that reach − 35 mm/year. These results are analyzed with respect to the main factors that control subsidence mechanisms: the thickness of the <b>compressible</b> <b>layer,</b> the presence of pumping wells, and the water table variation.

For simplicity, an ideal gas equation of state is used with a pressure-dependent reaction rate that results in a stable detonation wave structure. The detonation is initiated as an ideal Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) detonation with a one-dimensional structure, and then allowed to propagate into a finite diameter or thickness layer of explosive surrounded by an inert layer. The yielding confinement of the inert layer results in the detonation wave decaying to a sub-CJ steady state velocity or failing entirely. Simulations are performed with different values of the reaction rate pressure exponent (n = 2 and 3) and different impedance confinement (greater than, less than, and equal to the confinement of the explosive). The velocity decrement and critical dimension (critical diameter or thickness) are determined, and a 2 : 1 scaling between the cylinder diameter and slab thickness results is confirmed, in good agreement with curvature-based models of detonation propagation. The measured shock front curvature and detonation velocity relation agrees with the classic model of Wood and Kirkwood. The computational simulations are compared to a simple, analytic model that treats {{the interaction of the}} confinement with the detonation products via Newtonian theory and a model that assumes a continuous variation in shock front curvature with the shock angle at the interface with the confinement matching the angle determined by shock polar analysis.
