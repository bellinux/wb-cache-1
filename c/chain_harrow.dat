40|$|We studied big {{sagebrush}} {{plant community}} {{responses to a}} two-way <b>chain</b> <b>harrow</b> and broadcast seeding of herbaceous species at eight Wyoming big sagebrush sites with the same ecological site classification; five were cultivated for dryland wheat production during the 1950 - 1980 s, then seeded with introduced forage grasses and reverted back to grazing lands, while three had not been previously cultivated. Five years after treatment, densities of sagebrush seedlings and snakeweed plants increased in cultivated sites during {{the second and third}} year after treatment. In addition, perennial forb cover increased for cultivated sites, while perennial grass biomass increased for non-cultivated sites. Plant community change after treatment also varied between non-cultivated and cultivated sites, and response to treatment was most strongly correlated with reductions in sagebrush cover, increases in the perennial grass bulbous bluegrass, and increases in 10 herbaceous species—four of which were seeded. Our results emphasize that broad variability in plant community responses to sagebrush reduction is possible within the same ecological site classification, and that cultivation history can leave long- lasting legacy effects...|$|E

Seed was hand broadcasted and <b>chain</b> <b>harrowed</b> to complete the seeding. Seedling counts were taken in June, July, August, and September 2005, and again in June of 2006. Mature perennial species, annual frequency, and soil moisture were also monitored in each plot. Concurrently, forage samples of winterfat, squirreltail, creeping wildrye (Leymus triticoides (Buckl.), and Nuttall’s saltbush (Atriplex nuttallii (S. Wats.)) were collected for the months of November through April. Above ground biomass and fecal samples were also collected. Winterfat seedling emergence and survival was highest in the tilled treatments. Tilling treatments had the highest amount of soil moisture and reduced mature perennials and annual frequency better than the ripping, tilling, and control treatments. Squirreltail seedling emergence and survival did not differ between the treatments. However, surface roughness not provided by the tilled treatment may play {{a large role in}} capturing and providing microsite conditions necessary for natural recruitment.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of no-till farming systems has greatly reduced energy and machinery inputs while significantly improving soil health and productivity. However, {{the control of}} crop weeds and diseases in no-till (NT) systems has become increasingly difficult for landholders in Australia’s northern grains regions, with occasional strategic tillage (ST) being considered as a potential management option. This study investigated the effects of occasional ST on physical, chemical and biological soil properties, productivity, and weed control on five long-term (7 – 44 years) NT-managed soils. The study area extended from Biloela (Vertosol, 666 mm annual rainfall), Condamine (Sodosol, 624 mm annual rainfall), Moonie (Dermosol, 636 mm annual rainfall) and Warwick (Vertosol, 675 mm annual rainfall) in Queensland to Wee Waa (Vertosol, 582 mm annual rainfall) in New South Wales. Tillage treatments included chisel, offset disc and prickle–disc chain with various timings and frequencies. Soil samples (0 – 0. 3 m) obtained 3 and 12 months after occasional ST were analysed for total and particulate organic carbon (TOC, POC), available phosphorus (P), bulk density, soil water, and microbial enzymatic activity. In-crop weed density was also recorded. One-time tillage, with chisel tines, offset disc or <b>chain</b> <b>harrows,</b> in long-term NT helped to control winter weeds in the first year, with variable results in the second year. Grain yield overall showed no significant impact in either year, except on the Brown Sodosol (P = 0. 08) in the first year. The initial impacts of strategic tillage on soil water were largely restricted to the 0 – 0. 1 m depth range, with slight, non-significant decreases occurring. Available P, TOC, POC and total microbial enzymatic activity were not significantly impacted by either cultivation frequency or implement type. The use of an occasional ST {{for the purpose of}} weed control could be utilised as a viable management option for NT systems in the region without impacting on long-term productivity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Virtually all {{horses are}} {{infected}} with helminth parasites. For some decades, the control of parasites of Swedish horses {{has been based on}} routine treatments with anthelmintics, often several times per year. Since anthelmintic resistance is becoming an increasing problem it is essential to develop more sustainable control strategies, which are adapted to different types of horse management. The aim {{of this study was to}} obtain information on practices used by Swedish horse owners for the control of endoparasites. Methods A questionnaire with 26 questions about management practices and parasite control routines was posted to 627 randomly selected horse establishments covering most types of horse management in Sweden. Results The response rate was good in all categories of respondents (66 – 78 %). A total of 444 questionnaires were used in the analyses. It was found that virtually all horses had access to grazing areas, usually permanent. Generally, pasture hygiene was infrequently practiced. Thirty-six percent of the respondents clipped or <b>chain</b> <b>harrowed</b> their pastures, whereas weekly removal of faeces from the grazing areas was performed by 6 % of the respondents, and mixed or rotational grazing with other livestock by 10 %. The number of anthelmintic treatments per year varied from 1 – 8 with an average of 3. 2. Thirty-eight percent considered late autumn (Oct-Dec) to be the most important time for deworming. This finding, and an increased use of macrocyclic lactones in the autumn, suggests a concern about bot flies, Gasterophilus intestinalis. Only 1 % of the respondents stated that faecal egg counts (FEC) were performed on a regular basis. The relatively high cost of FEC analyses compared to purchase of anthelmintics was thought to contribute to the preference of deworming without a previous FEC. From the study it was evident that all categories of horse owners took advice mainly from veterinarians. Conclusion The results show that routines for endoparasite control can be improved in many horse establishments. To increase the knowledge of equine endoparasite control and follow the recommendations for how to reduce the spread of anthelmintic resistance, a closer collaboration between parasitologists and veterinary practitioners is desirable. </p...|$|R
50|$|Tine harrows {{are used}} to refine {{seed-bed}} condition before planting, to remove small weeds in growing crops and to loosen the inter-row soils to allow for water to soak into the subsoil. The fourth is a <b>chain</b> disk <b>harrow.</b> Disk attached to chains are pulled at an angle over the ground. These harrows move rapidly across the surface. The chain and disk rotate to stay clean while breaking up the top surface to about 1 in deep. A smooth seedbed is prepared for planting with one pass.Chain harrowing {{can be used on}} pasture land to spread out dung, and to break up dead material (thatch) in the sward, and similarly in sports-ground maintenance a light chain harrowing is often used to level off the ground after heavy use, to remove and smooth out boot marks and indentations. Used on tilled land in combination with the other two types, chain harrowing rolls remaining larger soil clumps to the surface where weather breaks them down and prevents interference with seed germination.|$|R
40|$|Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse) {{currently}} occupy {{an estimated}} 56 % {{of the potential}} range-wide pre-European settlement habitat. Population declines have been largely attributed to direct habitat loss and fragmentation related to anthropogenic activities that promote wildfires and the subsequent spread of invasive plants. Vegetation manipulations, including the seeding of plant species, such as forage kochia (Bassia prostrata), {{have been identified as}} potential strategies to mitigate the risk of wildfire and enhance sage-grouse habitat in areas at risk to wildfires. I evaluated the composition changes that occurred in a lower elevation sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) plant community within the Grouse Creek Watershed in western Box Elder County, Utah, USA, in response to prescribed vegetation manipulations (green-stripping through chain harrowing, juniper mastication, seeding forage kochia, applying Plateau® herbicide) and studied the effect of these changes on sage-grouse habitat-use patterns and vital rates. I monitored 53 radio-collared sage-grouse throughout the Grouse Creek watershed from 2010 - 2012. Seasonal movements suggested local individual bird adaptations to annual variations in weather and habitat fragmentation. Sage-grouse selected for untreated areas; however, treated areas were used to expand the size of the lek. Untreated areas exhibited a higher percent composition of shrubs compared to areas that were <b>chain</b> <b>harrowed</b> to prepare a seedbed. Sage-grouse nest success and adult male survival rates during this study were relatively low compared to range-wide population estimates. Nest predation was higher for nests located closer to roads. The forage kochia seeded in the firebreaks emerged the season after seeding (2011). Using microhistological techniques, I detected small quantities of forage kochia in sage-grouse fecal pellets. Nutrient analysis confirmed that forage kochia samples collected from the sites exhibited a high protein content and low secondary metabolite content, similar to black sagebrush (Artemisia nova). Although greenstripping with forage kochia in lower elevation sagebrush communities may prove to be a beneficial technique for protecting rangelands from wildfire and provide a dietary source for wildlife, site preparation should be conducted to minimize the impact on existing sagebrush canopy cover habitats. Long-term monitoring should be implemented to determine extended effects of greenstripping treatments on sagebrush habitat and sage-grouse vital rates. Although individual sage-grouse demonstrated local adaptations to fragmentation and seasonal variations in weather, increased fragmentation and climate change {{in this part of the}} Great Basin may increase meta-population extirpation risks inhabiting lower elevation sagebrush areas in the Grouse Creek Watershed...|$|R
