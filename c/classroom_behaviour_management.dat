High attrition rates {{in the first five}} years of teaching appear largely attributable to emotional exhaustion relating to a perception of an inability to cope with behavioural challenges within the classroom. There are many studies focused on this emotional exhaustion and extensive studies and theories regarding behavioural problems in students. This study, however aimed to provide data on a largely overlooked gap in understanding teachers' perspectives on <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>management.</b> How confident teachers feel, which strategies they believe useful and additionally the desirability of professional development in this area. A response was received from 200 teachers of year 1 to year 4 classes. Of these 200 teachers, 110 completed the entire survey and it is these responses that this study is based on. The results of this survey indicate a requirement for a comprehensive <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>management</b> programme to be utilised (particularly for teacher trainees).

This article describes the <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>management</b> (CBM) content on offer in Australian undergraduate primary education programs. To date, no nationwide studies exist that report the CBM instruction on offer in pre-service teacher education programs. Thirty-five primary teacher preparation programs were reviewed. Thirty programs (85. 7 %) contained mandatory course-work in CBM, 108 units contained relevant content, 33 of those were stand-alone CBM units (30. 6 %). More units were found with CBM content embedded within methods or inclusion units than stand-alone CBM units. The mean hours of CBM instruction per mandatory stand-alone unit was 31. 46 hours, 25. 5 for stand-alone electives, and 2. 3 hours within embedded units. The content of CBM units is reported {{as well as the}} research interests of the unit convenors and instructors. Implications of the major findings are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Pupils’ misbehaviour {{has been}} {{attracting}} {{the attention of}} media, educators and policy makers in many countries {{over the past several}} decades. The literature on the subject is extensive and ranges across different disciplines, foci and methodologies. However, the call for new understanding is still strong, as the interest in the topic seems not to abate. The present study adds to the literature by exploring how secondary school teachers manage incidents of minor misbehaviour in class. A case study methodology has been used, including classroom observations and interviews of six subject teachers, teaching the same year 8 bottom-set class, within one comprehensive secondary school. A third source of data is constituted by relevant school documents. Analysis of the six cases suggests a theory (the Congruence Hypothesis), which might explain why some teachers are more effective than others in tackling minor misbehaviour in school. Relying on evidence from the data, the hypothesis suggests that, among the many factors influencing pupils' behaviour, a significant element is the degree of congruence between the teachers' belief system, their classroom conduct and the school culture. The theory builds upon a social ecological perspective – which considers the individual, organization, community, and culture as spheres nested into one another like Russian dolls (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) - and takes into consideration two of those spheres: the individual (called the personal congruence level) and the organization (the institutional congruence level). It is hypothesized that the more the teachers are congruent at both personal and institutional level, the less likely it is that pupils will engage in minor misbehaviour. The concept of congruence finds sparse application within the educational field and makes almost no appearance in the area of pupils' misbehaviour. Consequently, the thesis can be considered as pioneer work. However, the aim of the study is not to present a definitive statement, but to put forward a model that could serve as a framework for further reflection and understanding. The findings are a useful addition to the knowledge-base relating to effective teaching on matter of <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>management.</b> Potentially they have implications for a range of stakeholders in both the informal and formal educational sectors, ranging from teachers and school leaders to governors, teachers' trainers and policy maker...|$|E

Also of interest {{was to investigate the}} possibility of developmental trajectories of academic motivation and <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> throughout adolescence. However, the focus within each {{study was to examine the}} sex differences in these constructs and trajectories. Chapter 2 revealed sex differences in academic motivation and <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> in adolescents with girls reporting significantly higher levels of positive dimensions of academic motivation in addition to higher levels of uncertain control and anxiety. Teachers’ reports of negative <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> revealed that boys engaged more in negative <b>behaviour</b> in the <b>classroom.</b> Interestingly, there was also a closer relationship between boys’ academic motivation and <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour.</b> It was found that variation in academic motivation was better predicted by gender identity than sex. For both males and females, identification with feminine traits was more closely associated with academic motivation. Variation in negative behaviour was predicted by both sex and gender identity (in particular a masculine identity). Chapter 4 examined sex differences in age-related trajectories of academic motivation and negative <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Boys were generally less motivated and exhibited more behavioural problems than girls throughout adolescence. However, girls showed a substantial decline in academic motivation between early and mid-adolescence. The results from Chapter 5 revealed relationships between mental toughness, motivation and behaviour.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a way of analyzing how beginner teachers talk about the <b>management</b> of <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> to reveal how they are thinking about their practice. Considerable reference {{is made in the}} literature about the factors that impact on the development of knowledge about teaching but very little is known about how it actually takes place, particularly in relation to managing <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour.</b> My thesis adds to our understanding of how this is taking place. Specifically, this thesis provides insights into how beginner teachers are developing strategies for managing behaviour within a performativity culture promoted by governments that prioritizes competence over transformation. Beginner teachers come to ITE equipped with beliefs, preconceptions and prior experiences of education, teaching and classroom management. This research provides case-study evidence of the different reasons that beginner teachers have for managing behaviour, that in turn, frames the kind of knowledge they develop and ultimately, the strategies they use. A theoretical model and set of conceptual tools are developed to analyze interview and observation data collected from five beginner teachers. The data collection spanned a twoyear period between September 2007 and July 2009. The model is used to chart the beginner teachers’ development of strategies over time and in different contexts. The outcomes of the analysis indicate that beginner teachers developed schemas that allowed them to adapt to new contexts by utilizing their pre-emptive plans rather than acting reflexively. The study contributes to the knowledge in the fields of <b>behaviour</b> <b>management</b> and teacher development in a number of ways. The model and the conceptual tools contribute to the theoretical understanding of how the personal and contextual factors influence beginner teachers’ development of strategies over time. The empirical part of the study provides insights into how these factors facilitate and impede the development of the beginner teachers’ strategies for managing <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{objectives of}} this study were to explore the influence of students’ perceptions of teachers’ <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> on their level of foreign language anxiety and motivation. The study also examined the interrelationships between students’ foreign language anxiety, motivation and achievement and students’ perceptions of teachers’ <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour.</b> In addition, students’ and teachers’ perceptions of teachers’ <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> were compared. A mixed method design was employed in this study. The quantitative data were obtained by utilising established questionnaires to measure students’ foreign language anxiety level and motivation at Time 1 (the beginning of the semester) and at Time 2 (10 weeks later) and students’ perceptions of teachers’ <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> at Time 2. Teacher participants completed a parallel teacher <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> questionnaire. At the end of the semester, students sat the Preliminary English Test (PET) to measure their achievement. Qualitative aspects were student interviews and classroom observations. A total of 344 students from two senior secondary schools, an International Standard School (ISS) and a non-International Standard School (non-ISS), and eight teachers (four from each school) participated in the study. Statistical analyses included repeated-measures MANOVA, repeated-measures ANOVA, one-way ANOVA and Pearson Product–Moment correlations. The study found: (1) The level of students’ language anxiety changed over an instructional semester and some of these changes were influenced by their perceptions of teachers’ <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Students’ perceptions of two teachers’ <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours,</b> negativity and unclear structuring of the class contributed to the increase in students’ anxiety level. (2) The level of students’ motivation to study English was affected by their perception of teachers’ <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours</b> and other aspects of learning. The dimensions of teachers’ behaviours which affected students’ motivation positively were structure and relatedness and a negative influence was teacher negativity. Factors other than teachers’ <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> were their teaching skills and classroom management, mastery of English, teaching materials and ISS school type. (3) Students’ perceptions of teachers’ <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> showed an inverse relationship with foreign language anxiety but positively correlated with students’ motivation and achievement. Students’ foreign language anxiety was negatively correlated with their motivation. (4) There were discrepancies between students’ and teachers’ perceptions of the teachers’ <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> due to teachers rating themselves more positively than their students did. The limitations of this research were acknowledged. The main limitation in research design was employing self-reported questionnaires to obtain the level of students’ foreign language anxiety and motivation as students {{may not be able to}} precisely rate their emotional and motivational states. In addition, students may not respond truthfully to questions concerning their teachers’ <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours</b> due to concern about the possibility that teachers may discover their answers, although prior explanation about confidentiality of the data was provided. The number of teachers participating in the study was relatively limited and the xiii fact that all teachers were female gives rise to an issue in terms of variance. Future research suggestions are to examine the effects of students’ perceptions of teachers’ <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours</b> on students’ test anxiety and whether gender differences exist in students’ perceptions of relatedness with the teacher and how it affects motivation to study. Research on students’ language anxiety in lower education levels is also encouraged to obtain a comprehensive picture of foreign language anxiety in different stages of learning...|$|R

The focus of this thesis is troublesome <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> and the behavioural interactions between teachers and students in secondary school. Following a review of the extant research literature, Section A of the thesis reports a study examining the perceptions of 145 secondary teachers from New South Wales with regard to behaviours they find troublesome in their classrooms. Talking out of turn was clearly identified as the <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> of most concern, most frequently occurring and, importantly, the main misbehaviour of the most troublesome individual students. In two studies completed in parallel, it was similarly shown that teachers who identified themselves as having particular difficulties with <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour,</b> or who had identified ten percent or more of their class as troublesome, experienced higher levels of stress related to <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> and their students perceived the classroom environment to be characterised by differential treatment of students. Section B of the thesis comprises observational studies of teachers and <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> with a substantial focus on student and teacher gender. Reviews of the literature on teachers' "natural" use of approval and disapproval and on differential teacher behaviour towards boys and girls were followed by two parallel studies. The first study, involving 79 New South Wales secondary school teachers and their classes, showed that while teachers typically responded to students with more approval than disapproval, almost all approval was reserved for academic behaviour whereas approval for appropriate <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> was very infrequent. Teachers typically reprimanded students for inappropriate behaviour at a very high rate. The second study showed that boys attracted far more teacher responses than girls but that most of this involved reprimands for inappropriate behaviour. Section C of the thesis relates teacher perceptions to observed <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour.</b> It was concluded that in classes with larger numbers of troublesome students there was reduced academic feedback to students and where teachers' rates of negative responding were higher there was a reduced perception of participation by students.

It {{is important to remember that}} a whole school approach to <b>behaviour</b> <b>management</b> is essential to support cohesive well running <b>classrooms.</b> Fewer <b>behaviour</b> concerns mean less stress and that means more opportunities for teachers and students to experience schools as they should be - positive, productive and stimulating centres of learning. 5 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} the relationship among structural empowerment in academia, nurse educators’ self-efficacy for teaching, and {{their perceptions of the}} types and frequencies of uncivil <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Methods: 56 participants, registered with the College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO), responded to a mail-out survey package containing four tools corresponding to each study variable. The analysis includes study descriptives, ANOVA analyses, correlations of total and subscales, and mediation analyses of the major study variables. Results: A moderate level of structural empowerment and a high level of self-efficacy for teaching was found within the study. A significant indirect relationship was seen between informal power, self-efficacy for classroom management, and the perceived frequency of low-level uncivil <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours</b> reported by nurse educators. Conclusions: Results show the importance of collegiality in nursing academia as it can influence educator confidence in managing uncivil <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{analyses of}} gender differences in <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours</b> (e. g., attentiveness and task persistence) and early academic outcomes. Data are drawn from Growing Up in Australia: The Longitudinal Study of Australian children (LSAC). In these analyses, data from Wave 1 data collection (2004) and Wave 2 data collection (2006) for the Kindergarten Cohort are used. A sample of 2, 315 children who were in Year 1 of school at Wave 2 data collection are the focus for the analyses reported. The analyses draw on teacher ratings of children’s literacy and language competence and mathematical thinking in Year 1 of school; as well as ratings of children’s self-regulatory <b>behaviour</b> in the <b>classroom</b> and level of problem behaviours. Girls were rated by their teachers as having better literacy and language outcomes that were predicted by more positive <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Results are discussed {{with respect to the}} influence of children’s <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours</b> on academic learning at the beginning of formal schooling...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the effects of}} a karate intervention on the cognition, executive function and <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours</b> of secondary school pupils. Participants were six year eight students (12. 7 ±. 5 years) from a bottom set mathematics class of a secondary school in the south of England. Cognitive measures and <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours</b> were assessed prior to, throughout {{and at the end of}} the intervention, using a logic and reasoning task, Stroop Colour-Word test and adapted Direct Behaviour Rating scale. The intervention was a six week karate program lead by the participants’ Physical Education teacher who is a qualified martial arts instructor. A social validation interview was conducted after all the data was collected. To assess the effects of the karate the raw data was reported for each participant. Responses to the measures, as a result of the karate, varied between the participants, with some significant positive and negative deviations from group trends. Links were shown between the responses in the incongruent condition of the Stroop Colour-Word test and <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours</b> for four of the participants, as a consequence of the karate. The results show that karate may be a mediator of executive function and <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour,</b> so interventions such as this may be used in schools in the future. It further reinforces the need for Physical Education in the curriculum where the physical activity directly impacts on other aspects of learning...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{the early}} school years, {{children}} need positive attitudes {{to school and}} experiences that promote academic and social competence. Positive relationships between children and teachers make {{a significant contribution to}} school achievement and social competence. Girls are more likely to display positive <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours</b> and positive approaches to learning than boys. Gender differences have also been noted in teacher-child relationships. This study investigated the relationship between gender differences in <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviour</b> and gender differences in teacher-child relationships in the early years. Method: Data were drawn from The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). LSAC is a cross-sequential cohort study funded by the Australian Government. In these analyses, Wave 1 (2004) and Wave 2 (2006) data for 4464 children in the Kindergarten Cohort were used. Children, at Wave 2, were {{in the early years of}} formal school. They had a mean age of 6. 8 years (SD= 0. 24). Measures included a 6 -item measure of Approaches to Learning (task persistence, independence) and teacher ratings on the SDQ. Teachers rated their relationships with children on the short form of the STRS. Results: Girls were found to have more positive relationships with their teachers and to display more positive <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours</b> than boys. Teachers described their relationships with boys as less close than their relationships with girls and rated girls as displaying more positive approaches to learning and fewer problem behaviours than boys. Positive teacher – child relationships were significantly related to more positive <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours.</b> The quality of the teacher-child relationship at time 1 (Wave 1) was the best predictor of the quality of the teacher-child relationship at time 2 (Wave 2). Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of developing positive learning related <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours</b> in understanding successful school transition and the key role played by early positive teacher-child relationships in promoting school adjustment. ...|$|R
40|$|Although student {{motivation}} {{has been}} a major focus of basic and applied research in educational psychology for a long time, not many studies have been reported on teacher motivation until recently. Researchers highlight the absence of a sound theoretical framework as the main reason for the lack of research in this area. The current study presents an integrated perspective on teacher motivation by incorporating two different constructs from extant theories (teachers’ self-efficacy from social cognitive theory and goal orientations from achievement goal theory) under the overarching framework of expectancy-value theory. The study analyses the influence of teachers’ self-efficacy (efficacies for classroom management, student engagement, and instructional strategies), and goal orientations (mastery, relational, and work-avoidance) on the selected four dimensions (expectation, structure, relatedness, and autonomy support) of their <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours.</b> A sample of 257 Victorian primary (n = 115), and secondary (n = 132), school teachers responded to the survey on an 11 -point response scale (0 - 100). Data on teachers’ self-efficacy were collected using Teachers’ Sense of Efficacy Scale (Tschannen-Moran & Woolfolk Hoy, 2001); Goal Orientations for Teaching Scale (Butler, 2012) was used to collect data on teachers’ goal orientations. Data on behavioural dimensions were collected using two scales: Teacher Style Scale (Watt & Richardson, 2007 b) and Teacher As Social Context Questionnaire (Belmont, Skinner, Wellborn, & Connell, 1988). The analyses of the data included confirmatory factor analysis (AMOS 20), Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), and, simple, multiple, and canonical correlation analyses (SPSS 20). Paired sample t-tests confirmed the significance of changes in teachers’ self-efficacy during the early career stage. Stepwise multiple regression analyses tested the moderation effects, and structural equation modelling (LISREL) was used to develop the model showing the relationships between the dependent and independent variables in the study. Results indicated positive relationships between teachers’ self-efficacy and their <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours,</b> further emphasising teachers’ self-efficacy as a key predictor of their <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours.</b> The malleable nature of self-efficacy was also supported by the data. The negative relationship between teachers’ work-avoidance goal orientations and their <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours,</b> and the positive association of teachers’ mastery and relational goal orientations with their <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours</b> were evident with the current data. The data supported the development and testing of a valid structural model relating teachers’ self-efficacy, goal orientations, and <b>classroom</b> <b>behaviours</b> underscoring the significance of expectancy-value theoretical framework in teacher motivation research...|$|R
