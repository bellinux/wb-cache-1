50|$|It was {{designed}} by Kohn Pedersen Fox and Goldstein, Hill & West Architects. Martin Brudnizki Design Studio is responsible for designing the interiors. The base is built from granite in order to resemble other buildings in the Flatiron District. Above the base {{there will be a}} <b>cantilevered</b> <b>tower</b> that becomes progressively wider as the tower becomes taller. DeSimone Consulting Engineers is the structural engineering firm for the project. The structural system of the building comprises cast-in-place concrete slabs and columns with lateral load resisting shear wall cores.|$|E
50|$|Similar to Calatrava's Puente del Alamillo in Seville, Spain, {{the bridge}} {{makes use of}} an angled <b>cantilever</b> <b>tower</b> to absorb some of the load and {{reduce the number of}} cable stays needed. The bridge {{consists}} of a single pylon counterbalancing a 160 m span with lengths of cables, making a dramatic architectural statement. While this is Calatrava's 40th bridge, it is the first he has designed to carry both train and pedestrian traffic.|$|R
2500|$|Dismantling {{was delayed}} by the {{presence}} of nesting cormorants. [...] As of mid November, the main-span portion of the western (left) <b>cantilever</b> and its <b>tower</b> had been almost completely removed and temporary supports were erected beneath the right portion of the eastern cantilever. As of May 2015, only a third of the rightmost span remained and by June 12, 2015 the task was completed On November 14, 2015 the concrete cellular foundation of pier E3 (which supported the eastern <b>cantilever</b> <b>tower)</b> was explosively demolished with the debris falling into the steel caisson below the mud bay bottom. Numerous sequentially detonated charges and an all-around air bubble curtain were used to reduce underwater shock waves in order to protect marine life.

50|$|The Sundial Bridge is a {{cantilever}} spar cable-stayed bridge, {{similar to}} Calatrava's earlier {{design of the}} Puente del Alamillo in Seville, Spain (1992). This type of bridge does not balance the forces by using a symmetrical arrangement of cable forces {{on each side of}} its support tower; instead, it uses a <b>cantilever</b> <b>tower,</b> set at a 42-degree angle and loaded by cable stays on only one side. This design requires that the spar resist bending and torsional forces and that its foundation resists overturning. While this leads to a less structurally efficient structure, the architectural statement is dramatic. The bridge is 700 ft in length and crosses the river without touching the water, a design criterion that helps protect the salmon spawning grounds beneath the bridge. The cable stays are not centered on the walkway but instead divide the bridge into a major and minor path.|$|R
50|$|Campbell-Hicks House is a {{historic}} home located at Huntington, Cabell County, West Virginia. It was built in 1896, and is a 2 1/2 story, masonry dwelling in the Queen Anne style. It features a slender, two story <b>cantilevered</b> rounded <b>tower.</b> It also has a full front porch with a roof upheld by five sets of paired fluted columns with Ionic order capitals.|$|R
5000|$|Wright {{nicknamed the}} Price Tower, {{which was built}} on the Oklahoma prairie, [...] "the tree that escaped the crowded forest," [...] {{referring}} not only to the building's construction, but also to the origins of its design. The Price Tower is supported by a central [...] "trunk" [...] of four elevator shafts which are anchored in place by a deep central foundation, as a tree is by its taproot. The nineteen floors of the building are cantilevered from this central core, like the branches of a tree. The outer walls hang from the floors and are clad in patinated copper [...] "leaves." [...] The building is asymmetrical, and like a tree, [...] "looks different from every angle." [...] Wright had championed these design ideas, which other architects had put to use before the construction of the Price Tower, as early as the 1920s in his design for an apartment complex of four <b>cantilevered</b> <b>towers</b> for St. Marks-in-the-Bowerie in downtown New York City. Following the effects of the Great Depression, the project was shelved and adapted by Wright for the Price Company in 1952. Wright, therefore, plucked his [...] "tree" [...] out of the [...] "crowded forest" [...] of Manhattan skyscrapers {{and placed it on the}} Oklahoma prairie where it continues to stand uncrowded by neighboring tall buildings.|$|R
40|$|Three {{designs of}} a guyed {{cylindrical}} tower and its foundation for an intermediate size horizontal axis {{wind turbine generator}} are discussed. The primary difference in the three designs is the configuration of the rotor. Two configurations are two-blade rotors with teetering hubs - one with full span pitchable blades, the other with fixed pitch blades. The third configuration is a three-bladed rotor with a rigid hub and fixed pitch blades. In all configurations the diameter of the rotor is 38 meters and the axis of rotation is 30. 4 meters above grade, and the power output is 200 kW and 400 kW. For each configuration the design is based upon for the most severe loading condition either operating wind or hurricane conditions. The diameter of the tower is selected to be 1. 5 meters (since it was determined that this would provide sufficient space for access ladders within the tower) with guy rods attached at 10. 7 meters above grade. Completing a design requires selecting the required thicknesses of the various cylindrical segments, the number and diameter of the guy rods, the number and size of soil anchors, {{and the size of the}} central foundation. The lower natural frequencies of vibration are determined for each design to ensure that operation near resonance does not occur. Finally, a cost estimate is prepared for each design. A preliminary design and cost estimate of a <b>cantilever</b> <b>tower</b> (cylindrical and not guyed) and its foundation is also presented for each of the three configurations...|$|R
25|$|The Queensboro Bridge is an {{important}} piece of <b>cantilever</b> architecture. The <b>towers</b> of the Brooklyn Bridge are built of limestone, granite, and Rosendale cement. Their architectural style is neo-Gothic, with characteristic pointed arches above the passageways through the stone towers. This bridge was also the longest suspension bridge in the world from its opening until 1903, and the first steel-wire suspension bridge. The Manhattan Bridge, Throgs Neck Bridge, Triborough Bridge, and Verrazano Bridge are all examples of Structural Expressionism.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower was}} {{designed}} by {{the architects of the}} Ministry of Public Building and Works: the chief architects were Eric Bedford and G. R. Yeats. Typical for its time, the building is concrete clad in glass. The narrow cylindrical shape was chosen because of the requirements of the communications aerials: the building will shift no more than 25 cm in wind speeds of up to 150 km/h (95 mph). Initially the first 16 floors were for technical equipment and power. Above that was a 35-metre section for the microwave aerials, and above that were six floors of suites, kitchens, technical equipment and finally a <b>cantilevered</b> steel lattice <b>tower.</b> To prevent heat build-up the glass cladding was of a special tint. The construction cost was £2.5 million.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} investigation {{aimed to}} {{the evaluation of}} the state of damage of historic brick masonry structure, referred to as The Bellevue Tower, is presented. The tower was built {{at the beginning of the}} 16 th century as part of the Ferrero Palace-Masserano-La Marmora, on the highest part of Biella, in the Italian region of Piedmont, and became the city landmark. The tower has a square plan for the first three lower floors from the ground level and an octagonal plan for the remaining four floors, ending with a stone-decorated <b>cantilevered</b> crowning. The <b>tower</b> was a part of a public Palace from which it was separated, in terms of property, at the beginning of the 20 th century. This separation altered the use and conservation path of the tower, that nowadays suffers from a severe state of damage and requires an immediate intervention and rehabilitation of the masonry structures and overhanging elements for safety reasons. A methodology is put forward for combining laboratory and non-destructive testing methods with a monitoring system in order to evaluate the potential for conservation of this historic tower and its sustainability, in view of an effective intervention design...|$|R
40|$|The {{issues of}} {{collapse}} of steel-truss transmission towers are {{addressed in the}} thesis. The collapse of one or several consecutive towers causes loss of electricity supply. Consequently, a part of income from energy supply may be lost. In addition, collapse of tower cause high direct costs of restoration of transmission line. In the theoretical part of the thesis, the most frequent collapse patterns due to extreme action on conductors, as well as possible solutions for protection of the towers against collapse are presented. The practical part of the thesis, which addresses electric transmission tower NC 74 of the 2 × 110 kV transmission line, involves definition of the design action according to standard EN 50341 - 1 and redesign of critical elements of the existing tower {{on the basis of}} linearelastic analysis. Follow nonlinear static analysis for sleet-based load cases, which represented the most critical action for design of the tower. The results of nonlinear static analysis indicated that overstrength due to redundancy of such towers is minor. The estimated overstrength of the tower is thus primarily consequence of the utilization rate of the structural elements in the design. In {{the last part of the}} thesis, capacity design procedure is applied to the transmission tower in order to prevent global collapse of structure. The diagonals and the vertical elements of the tower were protected against failure, whereas <b>cantilevers</b> of the <b>tower</b> were selected as week parts of the structure. In order to meet this requirement, the diagonals and vertical elements of the tower were strengthened, and the element of the cantilever, which had the largest utilization rate, was weakened by selecting smaller cross-section of the structural element of the cantilever. This design procedure prevents global collapse of structure for the price of increased mass of the structure, which was in this case approximately 14...|$|R
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{detecting}} the along-channel density gradient, along-channel variability in lateral circulation and stratification, and helping to resolve the local spatial variability in wind forcing, two sparser cross-estuary arrays were placed a tidal excursion landward and seaward of the primary dense array. These were identified as the northern (N) array and the southern (S) array. See “WINDSTATIONSCHEMATICSversion 9. 0. pdf” for description of each station within the all three transects. The primary cross-estuary instrument array, the main (M) array, consisted of stations equipped with bottom-mounted ADCPs equipped with temperature-salinity (T-S) recorders. Stations were marked with surface buoys equipped with meteorological sensors and surface temperature-salinity recorders. Additional T/S sensors were {{be placed in the}} middle of the water column on the inner 3 moorings to monitor pycnocline variability. At the instrumented tower station, a vertical array of 6 ADVs and 6 temperature-salinity recorders was deployed to provide direct measurements of velocity, momentum flux, turbulent dissipation, water column stability and surface wave statistics. The tower was an open-lattice structure designed for rigidity and to minimize flow disturbance. Taut cables from a 4 -anchor array were attached to a winch platform near the top of the tower through sheaves located at approximately 60 % of the tower height above the bottom. The ADVs were <b>cantilevered</b> away from <b>tower</b> perpendicular to the along-channel flow to minimize the potential for flow disturbance. Turbulence measurements collected at the tower were complemented with bottom tripod mounted ADVs at five additional locations to provide detailed near-bed turbulence measurements at five locations in the cross section. A sonic anemometer package was mounted to a platform on top of the tower with its measurement volume positioned to avoid any structural turbulent wakes. The apparatus was mounted on the same tower set to sample all three axes of wind velocity at 10 Hz for 30 min every hour. Temperature and relative humidity sensors were mounted just below the sonic anemometer. The topmost ADV was mounted approximately 1 m below MLW, and was set to sample both velocity and pressure at 4 Hz for approximately 9 min every 0. 5 hr for estimation of subsurface turbulent momentum flux, surface wave characteristics, and tidal height. All 11 of the other surface buoys were equipped with standard sensors for measuring wind velocity and temperature; the sensors were mounted 3 - 5 m above water, depending on the size of the buoy. Raw and processed data from each VIMS owned instrument are zipped in a folder, or series of folders, identified by the type and serial number of the instrument. See DEPLOYMENT 1 INSTRUMENTLIST. xlsx and “Wind Station Array V 6 Modified with VIMS deployed serial numbers. pdf” for a detailed list of all instruments deployed. “VIMS deployment logbook. pdf” and “VIMS retrieval logbook. pdf” provide detailed deployment and retrieval information for each VIMS instrument. ADV Burst data is too large for inclusion here so the data archived here includes only burst averages and statistics. Original Burst data is available upon request. All times are Eastern Standard Time (EST). While the project is a collaborative effort involving several researchers from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS), the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES) and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), the data archive here is primarily from VIMS owned instrumentation deployed as part of the project. A series of instruments were deployed in three transects in Upper Chesapeake Bay, South of the Choptank River from March to May 2012. This dataset was collected with autonomously deployed Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP), Acoustic Doppler Velicometers (ADV), and Conductivity and Temperature Sensors (CT).
