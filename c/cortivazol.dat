50|$|<b>Cortivazol</b> is a high-affinity agonist ligand for the {{glucocorticoid}} receptor {{and consequently}} {{is classified as}} a glucocorticoid.|$|E
30|$|Two {{intra-articular}} corticosteroids were studied: <b>cortivazol</b> 3.75  mg/ 1.5  ml (Altim®, Laboratoire Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France) and {{triamcinolone hexacetonide}} 40  mg/ 2  ml (Hexatrione®, laboratoires DEXO, Saint Cloud, France).|$|E
30|$|Whatever the {{dilution}} and {{the added}} molecule were, viscosity of the cross-linked viscosupplement remained {{much higher than}} that of the linear one. Addition of PBS at a ratio 1 : 1 caused a dramatic decrease (up to 97.5  %) of HA viscosity. <b>Cortivazol</b> and lidocain had a similar effect than PBS on linear HA. Both were much deleterious on cross-linked HA viscosity. Among corticosteroids, triamcinolone decreased much less HA viscosity than <b>cortivazol.</b> The effect of meglumine ioxaglate was dose-dependent. Up to a ratio 1 : 1 viscosity of the linear HA remained above the dilution effect. On the cross-linked HA, the deleterious effect of the contrast agent was evident as soon as a ratio 1 : 1 and became very marked at 1 : 2.|$|E
30|$|The {{rheological}} behavior {{of both a}} linear and a cross-linked HA, was studied before and after mixing with different volumes (ratio 1 : 0.5 – 1 : 4) of the following compounds: phosphate buffered saline (PBS, as a control), <b>cortivazol,</b> triamcinolone hexacetonide, lidocain chlorhydrate and meglumine ioxaglate. The flow curve of the different samples was obtained using a measuring method based on a constant shear rate.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Background: Glucocorticoids are {{the most}} {{important}} group of drugs used in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), however, resistance to this group remains the main obstacle in curing the disease. One of the possibilities to circumvent glucocorticoid resistance is the use of new compounds, such as <b>cortivazol</b> (CVZ), which has two binding sites for the glucocorticoid receptor. Aim: Analysis of ex vivo sensitivity to <b>cortivazol</b> and other glucocorticoids in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as well as the relationship to anticancer therapy outcome. Patients and Methods: Leukemic samples from 60 children with ALL were tested by the MTT assay for glucocorticoid resistance. Cell cycle before and after ex vivo glucocorticoid treatment was analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: Although all tested glucocorticoids presented significant cross-resistance, CVZ showed high antileukemic activity. The equivalent activity of CVZ was 165 -fold higher than prednisolone, 7. 5 -fold higher than dexamethasone and 2. 8 -fold higher than betamethasone. CVZ showed relatively better cytotoxicity than other glucocorticoids in prednisolone-poor-responders. CVZ, like other glucocorticoids, caused cell cycle arrest in the G 1 -phase, and increased the percentage of apoptotic cells {{to a greater extent than}} other glucocorticoids. The results of antileukemic therapy were strongly related to the ex vivo resistance to all tested glucocorticoids. Conclusion: <b>Cortivazol</b> has potent antileukemic activity in childhood ALL. Its activity is related to cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Glucocorticoids {{are the most}} important agents used in the therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children (1, 2). Resistance to this group of drugs is regarded as a one of the strongest prognostic factors, both in in vivo (3, 4) and in vitro conditions (5, 6). The mechanisms of antileukemic glucorticoid activity are related, in general, to activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (2, 7), heat shock proteins (2, 8), transcription factors (NF-Î B, AP 1) (9), transactivation or transrepression of genes (10) and induction of apoptosis (10). Most investigations on the antileukemic activity of glucocorticoids have been carried out on prednisolone and dexamethasone. A number of clinical studies in childhood ALL were also based on methylprednisolone (11) and high dose of dexamethasone (12) ...|$|E
30|$|The second {{lesson is}} that the 2 tested corticosteroids, both {{frequently}} used {{in the treatment of}} OA, have differential effects on the viscosupplement properties. <b>Cortivazol</b> has no significant impact on HA properties. The decrease in viscosity is only slightly greater than that obtained with PBS. Conversely triamcinolone hexacetonide seems to stabilize the viscosupplement, suggesting that the increase in viscosity, results from the existence of favourable interactions between HA and triamcinolone. Thus, if a corticosteroid should be injected together with a viscosupplement, it seems logical to favour the second rather than the first, as long as it has not been demonstrated this does not affect the clinical outcome.|$|E
30|$|For {{therapeutic}} injections, steroids {{are most}} commonly employed. Triamcinolone acetonide (40 mg/ml) or methylpredinosolone acetate (40 mg/ml) {{are widely used}} in North America at a dose ranging from 10 mg or less for small articulations to 40 mg for large articulations. In Europe, <b>cortivazol</b> (3.75 mg/ 1.5 ml) is the most frequently administered formulation. These different steroids {{have a tendency to}} form particles, which can be source of deleterious effects or complications. For this reason, it is recommended to substitute a non-particulate steroid, such as dexamethasone sodium phosphate (10 mg/ml), in specific circumstances that are {{beyond the scope of this}} paper [7]. Steroids can be mixed with a liberal amount of local anaesthetic.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTransforaminal {{injections}} {{are widely}} used. Serious complications including strokes and paraplegia {{have been reported}} after transforaminal injections of corticosteroids, and the Afssaps (2011) has issued a warning about their use [1]. The needle must be positioned in the posterior aspect of foramen, and its correct placement validated by an injection of contrast product. It is preferable to choose <b>cortivazol</b> (Altim®) as the corticoid for injection. This procedure is simple, reproducible, and durably effective in 60 to 70 % of cases. Complications and adverse effects are rare but potentially serious: allergies, blood pressure surge, vasovagal syncope, transient exacerbation of pain, infection, stroke, and paraplegia. The aim of this course is to stress the need for rigor — in the indication, the technical performance of the procedure, and the overall management of the patient...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Glucocorticoids (GC's) play an {{integral}} role in treatment strategies designed to combat {{various forms of}} hematological malignancies. GCs also are powerful inhibitors of the immune system, through regulation of appropriate cytokines and by causing apoptosis of immature thymocytes. By activating the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), GCs evoke apoptosis through transcriptional regulation of a complex, interactive gene network {{over a period of}} time preceding activation of the apoptotic enzymes. In this study we used microarray technology to determine whether several disparate types of hematologic cells, all sensitive to GC-evoked apoptosis, would identify a common set of regulated genes. We compared gene expression signatures after treatment with two potent synthetic GCs, dexamethasone (Dex) and <b>cortivazol</b> (CVZ) using a panel of hematologic cells. Pediatric CD 4 +/CD 8 + T-cell leukemia was represented by 3 CEM clones: two sensitive, CEM-C 7 – 14 and CEM-C 1 – 6, and one resistant, CEM-C 1 – 15, to Dex. CEM-C 1 – 15 was also tested when rendered GC-sensitive by several treatments. GC-sensitive pediatric B-cell leukemia was represented by the SUP-B 15 line and adult B-cell leukemia by RS 4; 11 cells. Kasumi- 1 cells gave an example of the rare Dex-sensitive acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). To test the generality of the correlations in malignant cell gene sets, we compared with GC effects on mouse non-transformed thymocytes. Results We identified a set of genes regulated by GCs in all GC-sensitive malignant cells. A portion of these were also regulated in the thymocytes. Because we knew that the highly Dex-resistant CEM-C 1 – 15 cells could be killed by CVZ, we tested these cells with the latter steroid and again found that many of the same genes were now regulated as in the inherently GC-sensitive cells. The same result was obtained when we converted the Dex-resistant clone to Dex-sensitive by treatment with forskolin (FSK), to activate the adenyl cyclase/protein kinase A pathway (PKA). Conclusion Our results have identified small sets of genes that correlate with GC-sensitivity in cells from several hematologic malignancies. Some of these are also regulated in normal mouse thymocytes. </p...|$|E
