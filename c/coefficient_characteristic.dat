This model of a dimer enzyme activated by the reaction product accounts quantitatively for glycolytic periodicities observed in yeast and muscle. The Hill <b>coefficient</b> <b>characteristic</b> of enzyme-substrate interactions is determined in the model, both at the steady state {{and in the course}} of sustained oscillations. Positive cooperativity is a prerequisite for periodic behavior. A necessary condition for oscillation in a dimer K system is a Hill coefficient larger than 1. 6 at the unstable stationary state. The analysis suggests that positive as well as negative effectors of phosphofructokinase inhibit glycolytic oscillations by inducing a decrease in enzyme cooperativity.

Here, we applied a similarity network-based methodology for the representation and analysis of protein sequences and structures sets using a non-redundant set of 311 proteins and three different information criteria based on sequence-derived features, sequence local alignment and structural alignment. A wide set of measurements, like network degree, clustering <b>coefficient,</b> <b>characteristic</b> path length and vertex centrality were utilized to characterize the networks’ topology. Protein similarity networks were found medium or highly interconnected and the existence of both clusters and random edges classified their fully connected versions as Small World Networks (SWNs).

Recently reported ancestral elements, like the α/β class and certain folds, were remarkably found to act as hubs in the networks. Additionally, the moderate information value of sequence-derived features when used for fold and class assignment was shown on a network basis.

The LED voltage drop features negative temperature <b>coefficient</b> <b>characteristic</b> and is subject to change depending on the forward current and the thermal resistivity of a given package.
