25|$|In {{medieval times}} the {{westerly}} {{end of the}} mound was dug away and a boundary ditch was laid out. Therefore, when looters dug into the apparent centre during the sixteenth century, they missed the real centre: nor <b>could</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> foreseen that the deposit lay very deep {{in the belly of}} a buried ship, well below the level of the land surface.|$|E
500|$|Whence, in {{the name}} of Count Buffon and Baron Cuvier, came those dogs that I saw in Typee? Dogs!—Big hairless rats rather; all with smooth, shining, {{speckled}} hides—fat sides, and very disagreeable faces. Whence <b>could</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> come? That they were not the indigenous production of the region, I am firmly convinced. Indeed they seemed aware of their being interlopers, looking fairly ashamed, and always trying to hide themselves in some dark corner. It was plain enough they did not feel at home in the vale—that they wished themselves well out of it, and back to the ugly country from which they must have come.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} {{alleviate}} Cebes' {{worry that the}} soul might perish at death, Socrates introduces his first argument for the immortality of the soul. This argument is often called the Cyclical Argument. It supposes that the soul must be immortal since the living come from the dead. Socrates says: [...] "Now if it be true that the living come from the dead, then our souls must exist in the other world, for if not, how <b>could</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been born again?". He goes on to show, using examples of relationships, such as asleep-awake and hot-cold, that things that have opposites come to be from their opposite. One falls asleep after having been awake. And after being asleep, he awakens. Things that are hot can become cold and vice versa. Socrates then gets Cebes {{to conclude that the}} dead are generated from the living, through death, and that the living are generated from the dead, through birth. The souls of the dead must exist in some place for {{them to be able to}} return to life.|$|E

2500|$|Taylor {{met with}} John Battle, then the Member of Parliament for Leeds West, in 1987 {{to present his}} findings, and Battle raised the matter in a House of Commons debate. Along with Leeds City Council, {{he called for a}} public inquiry into the deaths at Armley, but the {{incumbent}} Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher rejected the request, {{on the grounds that it}} [...] "would cause needless concern, that it was impossible to discover what had happened at Roberts, and that no one could then have imagined that the dust could have harmed residents." [...] Battle submitted to the House: [...] "I cannot believe that those who owned and ran Roberts can have gone in and out without seeing the dust everywhere on the surrounding streets and pavements. If they knew that their workers within had to be protected from the asbestos dust, how <b>could</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> ignored the position of their neighbours who lived with that dust outside? It was not rendered neutral or innocuous as it left their premises. If they knew, why did they knowingly continue to ask not only their employees but local residents for a generation to pay the price with their lives for the profits of continued asbestos production? ...Should not the company be responsible for that deadly legacy? The Armley asbestos tragedy cannot remain private and hidden because it is not yet over." ...|$|E

60|$|Both {{the girls}} felt their faces glow and their pulses throb; both {{knew they would}} do no good by rushing down into the mêlée.

40|$|Introduction: Although {{most studies}} report high {{frequencies}} of consent to HIV tests, {{critics argue that}} clients are subject to pressure, that acceptors later indicate <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> refused, and that provider-initiated HIV testing raises serious ethical issues. We examine the meaning of consent and why clients think <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> refused. Methods: Clients in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Malawi and Uganda were asked about consenting to HIV tests, whether <b>they</b> thought <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> refused and why. Textual responses were analyzed using qualitative and statistical methods. Results: Among 926 respondents, 77 % reported <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> said no, but in fact, 60 % actively consented to test, 24 % had no objection and only 7 % tested without consent. There were few significant associations between categories of consent and their covariates. Conclusions: Retrospectively asking clients if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> refused to test for HIV overestimates coercion. Triangulating qualitative and quantitative data suggests a considerable degree of agency...|$|R

His {{disappointment}} and grief were too deep for anything but silence, and Hazard, who felt likewise, never opened his mouth as he fed the horses, nor once laid his head against their arching necks or passed caressing fingers through their manes. The two boys were blind, also, to the manifold glories of Mirror Lake which reposed at their very feet. Nine times, had they chosen to move along its margin the short distance of a hundred yards, <b>could</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> seen the sunrise repeated; nine times, from behind as many successive peaks, <b>could</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> seen the great orb rear his blazing rim; and nine times, had they but looked into {{the waters of the}} lake, <b>could</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> seen the phenomena reflected faithfully and vividly. But all the Titanic grandeur of the scene was lost to them. They had been robbed of the chief pleasure of their trip to Yosemite Valley. They had been frustrated in their long-cherished design upon Half Dome, and hence were rendered disconsolate and blind to the beauties and the wonders of the place.|$|E
