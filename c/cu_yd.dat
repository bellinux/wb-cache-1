40|$|Beach {{nourishment}} has {{not been}} a proactive tool for rebuilding lost sea turtle nesting habitat, yet much habitat may be missing owing to beach erosion caused by the long history of harbor and inlet engineering. To estimate the potential loss of nesting habitat, a century of dredge and fill data for the east coast of Florida was extracted from two online databases (US Army Corps of Engineers and Duke University). The records show removal of over 150 million <b>cu</b> <b>yd</b> of material from the sand budget by disposal at offshore and at upland sites. The volume of harbors and channels was increased by a little over 62 million <b>cu</b> <b>yd.</b> Little of the lost material has been returned, and much of the remaining sand has become redistributed, with a possible loss of dunes and the dry berm in which sea turtles build nests. Allowing the deepened harbors and inlets to refill may further erode beaches and dunes. Assuming the depth is maintained, and that 30 % of the material removed was never part of the sand sharing system in the first place, in 2003 a sand deficit remained of a little more than 60 million <b>cu</b> <b>yd.</b> This is enough sand for a layer 2 yd deep, 100 yd wide and 185 miles long. Improvements in engineering theory and practice and diligence on the part of sea turtle managers have reduced the short term impacts on turtles, and increased the durability of restored beaches. It may now be appropriate to incorporate beach nourishment as a tool in the restoration of critical nesting habitat for sea turtles. Replacing the amount of sand missing may restore all currently unsuitable nesting beaches to full sea turtle production capacity. Finding enough sand of appropriate quality to import into the system is an immediate concern. The increasing cost of fuel is another. Failure to act now may mean the opportunity for humanity to restore sea turtle nesting habitat will be lost...|$|E

BACKGROUND; The Corps of Engineers must dredge about 300 million <b>cu</b> <b>yd</b> of sediments from the nation's harbors and navigation channels each year to accomplish its mission of keeping the waterways open for navigation. Some of this material, especially in industrial harbors, is contaminated by pollut-ants, either residual materials in treated discharges from cities and indus-tries or materials washed from farms, streets, parking lots, or industrial areas by runoff. In many cases, contaminated dredged material may not be dis-posed of in open water, but must be placed on land in a confined disposal The effluent from these large sedimentation basins/storage areas is 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Con-area. considered a discharge under Section trol Act, which requires a permit. Certification must be obtained from or waived by the state under Section 401 such that the effluent discharge will not violate applicable water quality standards. Section 401 also requires the certification to set forth necessary effluent limitations and monitoring requirements. A National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) per-mit is not required, so NPDES monitoring should not be imposed.

40|$|Structure {{dimension}} monitoring The individual {{structures were}} surveyed twice during the testing period. The first survey occurred after construction was complete {{and the second}} survey occurred after test completion when the river water had fully receded from the test site. The method of survey used was a total station theodolite referenced to benchmarks at the site. The elevation data were corrected to National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) 1988. Figures 3 - 17 through 3 - 26 represent the survey data and dimensioned layouts for the four structures. Volume calculations were made for each structure by creating two surfaces from the survey data, using AutoCAD Land Desk Top Developer&. The first surface was created with the perimeter measurements of each structure. The second surface was created using the outside and top measurements of each structure. The software allows the user to display the different surfaces common to the same footprint for calculating the total internal volume. The grid cell size of 1 sq ft was chosen for simplicity. The resulting volume was converted to cubic yards and is shown on the following figures for each structure. All structures except Portadam had an internal volume. Figure 3 - 17.

The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate optimal dredging volumes and intervals, and to determine the beach placement volume and renourishment interval to maintain two Shore Protection Projects. The Coastal Modeling System (CMS) was applied to analyze the morphological impact on the sediment dynamics for ebb-tidal delta mining at St. Augustine Inlet over 1. 4 -year simulations. Results determined that dredging scenarios under 4 Mill <b>cu</b> <b>yd</b> removed did not significantly modify the ebb-tidal delta. The CMS modeling results on sustainable dredging volumes, combined with historical infilling rates, provided constraints with which to develop dredging and beach fill scenarios for GenCade, a 1 -D numerical model that predicts shoreline change. GenCade was applied to evaluate sediment management alternatives for dredging intervals of 5, 7 and 10 years, and varying beach fill volumes and placement lengths. Results indicate that imposing a 10 -year dredging interval to the navigation project and ebb delta with the maximum dredging quantity of 3 million cubic yards will yield the best performance of the regional projects of St. Johns County. GenCade calculates future sediment budgets for various management scenarios, and can provide an essential benefit in determining optimal dredging periods for coordinated regional efforts to save in mobilization and demobilization costs for dredging and beach fill placement...|$|E
