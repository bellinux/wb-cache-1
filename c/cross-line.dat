El-Amra is the first site where this culture group was found unmingled with the later Gerzean culture group, but this period is better attested at the Naqada site, so it also is {{referred}} to as the Naqada I culture. Black-topped ware continues to appear, but white <b>cross-line</b> ware, a type of pottery which has been decorated with close parallel white lines being crossed by another set of close parallel white lines, is also found at this time.

2500|$|The Amratian {{culture is}} named after the site of el-Amreh, about [...] south of Badari. El-Amreh was the first site where this culture was found unmingled with the later Gerzeh culture. However, this period is better attested at Nagada, and so is also {{referred}} to as the [...] "Naqada I" [...] culture. Black-topped ware continued to be produced, but white <b>cross-line</b> ware, a type of pottery decorated with close parallel white lines crossed by another set of close parallel white lines, began to be produced during this time. The Amratian period falls between S.D. 30 and 39. Newly excavated objects indicate that trade between Upper and Lower Egypt existed at this time. A stone vase from the north was found at el-Amreh, and copper, which is not present in Egypt, was apparently imported from the Sinai Peninsula or perhaps Nubia. Obsidian and an extremely small amount of gold were both definitively imported from Nubia during this time. Trade with the oases was also likely.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 34-40 mm. The moth is olive-green coloured, with broader forewings. Its <b>cross-lines</b> and {{bands are}} usually more evenly and extensively whitish. The ground colour of the forewings is olive-green or grey green. There is a paler central band and a pale basal area. The <b>cross-lines</b> and chevron bands form an intricate pattern. The sub marginal line is white. The hind wings are pale grey {{with a dark}} discal spot.|$|R
60|$|It is {{the popular}} day, the {{shilling}} day, {{and of the}} fast arriving excursion trains two from different directions enter the two contiguous railway stations at almost the same minute. One, like several which have preceded it, comes from London: the other by a <b>cross-line</b> from Aldbrickham; and from the London train alights a couple; a short, rather bloated man, with a globular stomach and small legs, resembling a top on two pegs, accompanied by a woman of rather fine figure and rather red face, dressed in black material, and covered with beads from bonnet to skirt, that made her glisten as if clad in chain-mail.|$|E
60|$|We {{then walked}} {{to the top of}} Gloucester Street, expecting to see the Duke of Edinburgh's memorial. I left it an arch of sticks and timber {{spanning}} this main <b>cross-line,</b> which leads to Government House. The temporary was to be supplanted by a permanent marble arc de triomphe, commemorating the auspicious occasion when the black colony first looked upon a live white Royal Highness. At once 700l. was subscribed, and only 800l. was wanting; but all those interested in the matter died, and the 350l. which remained in the chest was, I believe, transferred to the 'Willyfoss.' The august day is still kept as a public holiday, for the people are, after their fashion, loyal-mouthed in the extreme. But the memorial is clean forgotten, and men stare if you ask about it. Half-way up the street is the post-office, whose white chief is not a whit more civil than the negro head in 1862.|$|E

Then there is a cross-mark which would show a change. Some good fortune befell you. Then the lines darken. Things go {{from bad to worse}} as they proceed. You took to a vice--cards or horse-racing. Here are evil associates, but there is a white line that runs through them. There is a girl somewhere, with fair hair and blue eyes, who loves you, and whom you love, and whose happiness is imperiled by this vice and these associates. Beyond, there is another <b>cross-line</b> and signs of a conflict. What happens after will depend upon yourself. Either the white line and the true love will prove too powerful for the bad influences or these will end in ruin and--ah! sudden and violent death. Your future, therefore, depends upon yourself, and it is for you to say which influence must triumph. That is all." ...|$|E

This modular have fine crossed lines indication of 1. 2 mm sharpness at 5 m distance, and simultaneously ranging accuracy of 3 mm {{up to the}} range of 100 m. The theoretical derivation, CAD/CAM design, and lens design together with experimental results will be presented in detail. Intorduction Target indication {{is very important in}} many applications. There are enormous laser indicator products commercial available in <b>cross-lines</b> and multiple <b>cross-lines</b> indications.

[1],[2] The best and rather expensive laser indicators with fine sharpness only down to 1. 5 mm line width at 5 m distance. We have designed and demonstrated our laser indication modular achieved the fine sharpness down to 1. 2 mm line width at 5 m distance, using inexpensive aspherical lens. What is more, the laser indication simultaneously measure the accurate distance is more useful in many applications. We have developed a laser range finder modular using this fine sharpness <b>cross-lines</b> as target marking and effectively achieved the laser ranging capabilities. Our laser rang...|$|R

It is shown that an more pricise method for gaining polarization data of the coated steel in seawater is the electrochemical measurement carried out by COLT system and the method of scratching <b>cross-lines</b> or cathodic polarization for coating damage is simple and convenient for estimating the polarization data of a new coated hull that {{is closely related to}} the coating properties...|$|R

On a map, the text that is chosen should be consistent. Generally, serif fonts are utilized to give a more regimented block body of textâ€”similar to those used in traditional printing.
