25|$|On tilled soil a {{one-piece}} roller has {{the disadvantage}} that when turning corners the outer {{end of the}} roller has to rotate much faster than the inner end, forcing one or both ends to skid. A one-piece roller turned on soft ground will skid up a heap of soil at the outer radius, leaving heaps, which is counter-productive. Rollers are often made {{in two or three}} sections to reduce this problem, and the <b>Cambridge</b> <b>roller</b> overcomes it altogether by mounting many small segments onto one axle so that they can each rotate at local ground-speed.|$|E

[...] "It owns {{a team of}} horses, cart, horse-hoe, plough, ridger, harrow, <b>Cambridge</b> <b>roller,</b> marker; and hires other implements as required; it insures, buys, and sells co-operatively. This year (for patriotic reasons) wheat and potatoes form the chief crop, with sufficient oats, barley, beans and mangolds to feed the horses and the pigs, {{of which there are}} many. The society last year marketed more fat pigs {{than the rest of the}} village and adjoining farms put together.|$|E

40|$|The {{regulation}} of water {{regime in the}} soil {{is the most important}} task in semi-humid climate with not even precipitation distribution conditions. Reduced or minimum tillage may change soil hydrological properties. The objectives of this study were to investigate the possibilities to manage soil water regime during the whole soil tillage system for sugar beet, which are especially sensitive for water deficit or abundance. Five field experiments were carried out at the Ex-perimental Station of the Lithuanian University of Agriculture (Aleksandras Stulginskis University since 2011) (54 ˚ 52 'N, 23 ˚ 49 'E) during 1995 - 2010. The soil of the experiments was silty loam Luvisol. In this study we highlighted the reduction of primary soil tillage from deep annual soil ploughing to shallow ploughing, deep and shallow cultivation and no till, comparison of soil ploughing and subsoiling, presowing ploughed or unploughed soil tillage with different cultivators—S-tine, complex, rotary and others, soil compressing with <b>Cambridge</b> and spur <b>rollers</b> before and after sugar beet sowing investigations. According to the results of experiments, reduction of primary soil tillage conserved soil water. The highest storage of soil water in spring was observed in non-reversibly tilled or not tilled soil. Subsoiling led higher water infiltration rate, and top layer of subsoiled soil consisted less moisture content than ploughed. Suga...|$|R
