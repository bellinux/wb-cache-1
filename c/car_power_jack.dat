50|$|Compaq Presario 1200 laptops {{are often}} found with damaged <b>power</b> <b>jacks.</b> Some of these <b>power</b> <b>jacks</b> {{appear to have}} been blown in half due to some sort of short; others rip their copper traces off of the {{motherboard}} due to stress placed on the <b>power</b> <b>jack.</b> Presario 1200 laptops typically have four tiny copper rings embedded in the motherboard behind the <b>power</b> <b>jack</b> {{that can be used to}} reattach a slightly damaged <b>power</b> <b>jack</b> and repair the failing unit.The LCD Power Inverter cable (which runs through the hinge from the base to the screen), is very susceptible to damage, given the strain of bending when closing the lid. The cable is a 6-strand ribbon variety, and therefore soldering is all but impossible.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Various prototypes have {{demonstrated}} the feasibility of light <b>cars</b> <b>powered</b> with solar energy. While the case of <b>cars</b> <b>powered</b> only by the sun seems not yet feasible for practical uses, {{the concept of a}} small electric hybrid car assisted by solar cells appears more realistic. In the paper, a systematic study on the sizing and the performance of a vehicle combining thermal engine, electric motor and generator, battery and solar cells is presented, in order to evaluate their features in terms of <b>car</b> <b>power,</b> weight and fuel savings...|$|R

50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{infrastructure}} operator Railtrack ordered 25 two-car {{units in}} 1998. The first 25 trainsets {{had only one}} driving <b>car</b> <b>powered.</b> An additional order for 7 more trainsets was placed in 2000 - these units had both end <b>cars</b> <b>powered</b> giving {{a top speed of}} 75 mph.

2500|$|<b>Power</b> <b>cars</b> 001 to 020 and 501 to 520 had {{conventional}} power converters. All other <b>power</b> <b>cars</b> (051 to 090 and 551 to 591) have power converters that use GTO thyristors which {{are responsible for}} the distinctive [...] "melody" [...] when the <b>power</b> <b>car</b> is brought up to speed. <b>Power</b> <b>cars</b> with conventional <b>power</b> converters weigh about 80.4t, those with GTO power converters two and a half tons less. In October 2007, Deutsche Bahn tendered refitting two <b>power</b> <b>cars</b> with IGBT <b>power</b> converters instead of the GTOs. After field testing, up to 36 additional <b>power</b> <b>cars</b> were converted.|$|R

5000|$|... i.Link is Sony's {{name for}} IEEE 1394; the port is {{compatible}} with 4 pin FireWire cables, and is unpowered. 6 pin firewire cables will need an adapter. The i.Link port on the docking station additionally has a <b>power</b> <b>jack</b> next to the 4 pin jack, used only for Sony compatible CD and DVD drives. Only drives compatible with this extended <b>power</b> <b>jack</b> are capable of booting CDs and DVDs on the U-series. Other drives may work once booted into the OS, but will not boot setup CDs or DVDs. There are at least four Sony drives that will work: PCGA-CRWD2, PCGA-DVRW1, PCVA-DRW3, and PCGA-DVD1/A.|$|R
5000|$|While an {{electric}} <b>car's</b> <b>power</b> source is not explicitly an on-board battery, electric <b>cars</b> with motors <b>powered</b> by other energy sources are generally {{referred to by}} a different name: {{an electric}} car carrying solar panels to power it is a solar car, and an electric <b>car</b> <b>powered</b> by a gasoline generator {{is a form of}} hybrid car. Thus, an electric car that derives its power from an on-board battery pack is a form of battery electric vehicle (BEV). Most often, the term [...] "electric car" [...] is used to refer to battery electric vehicles.|$|R

In 1834, Vermont blacksmith Thomas Davenport built a similar contraption which operated on a short, circular, electrified track. In 1834, Professor Sibrandus Stratingh of Groningen, the Netherlands and his assistant Christopher Becker created a small-scale electrical <b>car,</b> <b>powered</b> by non-rechargeable primary cells.|$|R
