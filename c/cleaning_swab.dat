40|$|Introduction: {{cleaning}} validation is {{an integral}} part of current good manufacturing practices in pharmaceutical industry. The main purpose of cleaning validation is to prove the effectiveness and consistency of cleaning in a given pharmaceutical production equipment to prevent cross contamination and adulteration of drug product with other active ingredient. Objective: a rapid, sensitive and specific reverse phase HPLC method was developed and validated for the quantitative determination of irinotecan hydrochloride in <b>cleaning</b> validation <b>swab</b> samples. Method: the method was validated using waters symmetry shield RP- 18 (250 mm x 4. 6 mm) 5 µm column with isocratic mobile phase containing a mixture of 0. 02 M potassium di-hydrogen ortho-phosphate, pH adjusted to 3. 5 with ortho-phosphoric acid, methanol and acetonitrile (60 : 20 : 20 v/v/v). The flow rate of mobile phase was 1. 0 mL/min with column temperature of 25 °C and detection wavelength at 220 nm. The sample injection volume was 100 µl. Results: the calibration curve was linear over a concentration range from 0. 024 to 0. 143 µg/mL with a correlation coefficient of 0. 997. The intra-day and inter-day precision expressed as relative standard deviation were below 3. 2 %. The recoveries obtained from stainless steel, PCGI, epoxy, glass and decron cloth surfaces were more than 85 % and there was no interference from the cotton swab. The detection limit (DL) and quantitation limit (QL) were 0. 008 and 0. 023 µg ml- 1, respectively. Conclusion: the developed method was validated with respect to specificity, linearity, limit of detection and quantification, accuracy, precision and solution stability. The overall procedure can be used as part of a cleaning validation program in pharmaceutical manufacture of irinotecan hydrochloride...|$|R
40|$|Biofilm {{formation}} on {{food processing}} surfaces {{has been well}} documented. Plastic cutting boards used in the foodservice/commercial food preparation kitchen setting would be ideal surfaces for a biofilm to form. The purpose of this experiment {{was to determine if}} biofilms were capable of forming on cutting boards that were used in a foodservice/commercial food preparation kitchen. Three 25 cm 2 surface areas were randomly selected on 15 plastic cutting boards (n = 45) from a food preparation kitchen to be swabbed before and after proper <b>cleaning</b> and sanitizing. <b>Swabs</b> were diluted in buffered peptone water, serial dilutions made on Plate Count Agar and incubated for 48 hours at 37 °C. The average aerobic plate count for the plastic cutting boards before sanitation was 1. 31 x 10 E 4 + 2. 00 x 10 E 4 CFU/ 25 cm 2. After sanitation of the plastic cutting boards, the average aerobic plate count was 1. 35 x 10 E 3 + 1. 91 x 10 E 3 CFU/ 25 cm 2.

40|$|Abstract: In the {{pharmaceutical}} industry, {{an important step}} consists in the removal of possible drug residues from the involved equipments and areas. The cleaning procedures must be validated and methods to determine trace amounts of drugs have, therefore, to be considered with special attention. An HPLC–UV method for the determination of digoxin residues on stainless steel surfaces was developed and validated {{in order to control}} a <b>cleaning</b> procedure. Cotton <b>swabs,</b> moistened with methanol were used to remove any residues of drugs from stainless steel surfaces, and give recoveries of 85. 9, 85. 2 and 78. 7 % for three concentration levels. The precision of the results, reported as the relative standard deviation (RSD), were below 6. 3 %. The method was validated over a concentration range of 0. 05 – 12. 5 µg mL- 1. Low quantities of drug residues were determined by HPLC–UV using a Symmetry C 18 column (150 × 4. 6) mm, 5 µm) at 20 °C with an acetonitrile–water (28 : 72, v/v) mobile phase at a flow rate of 1. 1 mL min- 1, an injection volume of 100 µL and were detected at 220 nm.

40|$|Background: Skin {{autofluorescence}} (SAF) is a noninvasive {{marker of}} accumulation of advanced glycation end products. It predicts cardiovascular complications and mortality in diabetes and renal failure. We assessed {{the influence of}} potential common confounders in SAF measurement, by determining the effects of endogenous and exogenous local dermal changes by body creams, hyperemia, vasoconstriction, and hydration. Methods: SAF was measured before and after local administration of body lotion, day cream, sunscreen, or self-browning cream and after attempts to remove these effects with alcohol swabs and washing. SAF was measured before and during three hyperemia maneuvers: vasoconstriction and on a dry and wet skin. Results: The body lotion increased SAF by 18 %. Day cream, sunscreen, and self-browning cream gave an increase of > 100 %. Except for body lotion, subsequent <b>cleaning</b> with alcohol <b>swabs</b> and washing with soap did not return SAF to baseline values. The effect of self-browning cream persisted for 2 weeks and that of sunscreen for 4 days. Hyperemia caused by a hot bath, capsicum cream, or postocclusive reactive hyperemia gave a decrease in SAF of, respectively, 18 %, 22 %, and 2. 3 %. Vasoconstriction caused by immersing the arm in cold water gave a 10 % increase. Hydration state did not influence SAF. Conclusions: Measurement of SAF is strongly affected by several skin creams. This effect was often not fully corrected by alcohol swabs and washing with soap and may persist for many days. Marked hyperemia and vasoconstriction also influence SAF. We advise avoiding these potential error sources...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether osseointegration can occur on a surface which {{had previously been}} coated with dental plaque. The mandibular premolar regions of four young adult Labrador dogs {{were used for the}} study. The lower premolars (P 1, P 2, P 3, and P 4) were extracted {{on either side of the}} mandibles. Following a 12 -week healing period, three 3. 75 mm x 13 mm commercially pure titanium implants (Nobel Biocare®AB, Gothenburg, Sweden) were partially inserted in one side of each mandible. This resulted in some threads protruding from the tissues into the oral cavity. Plaque was allowed to accumulate on the exposed implant surfaces. Following a 5 -week healing period, the contaminated parts of each implant were treated using three different <b>cleaning</b> techniques: (1) <b>swabbing</b> with supersaturated citric acid for 30 s on a cotton pellet followed by rinsing with physiological saline, (2) cleansing with a toothbrush and physiological saline only for 1 min, and (3) swabbing with 10 % hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) on a cotton pellet for 1 min followed by rinsing with physiological saline. The treated implants and one previously unused implant (control) were then placed into freshly prepared tapped sites to the full implant length on the contralateral sides of the mandibles. Following 11 weeks of healing, biopsies were obtained and ground sections prepared for histomorphometric analysis. All treatment modalities were associated with direct bone to implant contact on the portion of implant surface previously exposed to the oral environment. In conclusion, The results demonstrate that osseointegration can occur to surfaces that were plaque contaminated and cleaned by different methods. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Cleaning and {{disinfection}} of {{the broiler}} stable environment {{is an essential}} part of farm hygiene management. Adequate cleaning and disinfection is essential for prevention and control of animal diseases and zoonoses. The goal of this study was to shed light on the dynamics of microbiological and non-microbiological parameters during the successive steps of cleaning and disinfection and to select the most suitable sampling methods and parameters to evaluate cleaning and disinfection in broiler houses. The effectiveness of cleaning and disinfection protocols was measured in six broiler houses on two farms through visual inspection, adenosine triphosphate hygiene monitoring and microbiological analyses. Samples were taken at three time points: 1) before cleaning, 2) after cleaning, and 3) after disinfection. Before cleaning and after disinfection, air samples were taken in addition to agar contact plates and swab samples taken from various sampling points for enumeration of total aerobic flora, Enterococcus spp., and Escherichia coli and the detection of E. coli and Salmonella. After <b>cleaning,</b> air samples, <b>swab</b> samples, and adenosine triphosphate swabs were taken and a visual score was also assigned for each sampling point. The mean total aerobic flora determined by swab samples decreased from 7. 7 +/- 1. 4 to 5. 7 +/- 1. 2 log CFU/ 625 cm(2) after cleaning and to 4. 2 +/- 1. 6 log CFU/ 625 cm(2) after disinfection. Agar contact plates were used as the standard for evaluating cleaning and disinfection, but in this study they were found to be less suitable than swabs for enumeration. In addition to measuring total aerobic flora, Enterococcus spp. seemed to be a better hygiene indicator to evaluate cleaning and disinfection protocols than E. coli. All stables were Salmonella negative, but the detection of its indicator organism E. coli provided additional information for evaluating cleaning and disinfection protocols. Adenosine triphosphate analyses gave additional information about the hygiene level of the different sampling points...|$|R
40|$|Jennifer Jae GutierrezInkjet {{prints are}} a new medium {{in the field of}} art {{conservation}} in relation to other art forms. In order to establish why inkjet prints should be cared for, familiarity with the history and current uses of inkjet prints is necessary. An understanding of the materials which create inkjet prints is essential in determining protocol for their care and treatment. Inkjet prints may be damaged by a variety of sources, and the longevity of inkjet prints may vary based upon which combination of materials has been chosen. Establishing protocol for surface cleaning inkjet prints is a need within the field of art conservation, and was determined to be the goal of this project. The materials tested are widely used to create fine-art inkjet prints. The Epson Stylus Pro 4800 printer was chosen for this reason, and because it employs the K 3 Ultrachrome ink set, which is pigment based. Two different microporous inkjet papers, Epson Ultra Premium Photo Paper Luster and Ilford Galerie Gold Fibre Silk, were tested. A digital file, or ???target,??? was designed using well-known color space values, and used to create twelve sample prints. Preliminary quantitative measurements of changes in color were made, as well as qualitative analysis of surface sheen and dye migration. This analysis was repeated after testing. The cleaning solutions tested were deionized water, a water and ethanol solution, and a PhotoFlo and water solution. These materials were chosen because they are common cleaning agents which are likely {{to be found in the}} labs of most photograph conservators. Two cleaning techniques were tested; application with a cotton swab and full immersion. Results suggest that two of the cleaning materials used may be acceptable for future treatment of inkjet prints. Ethanol and water was determined to be inappropriate for cleaning the inkjet materials tested in this study, and immersion was determined to be inappropriate for prints created on Ilford Galerie Gold Fibre Silk. <b>Cleaning</b> with cotton <b>swabs</b> produced noticeable changes in surface sheen in paper white areas, but this technique may be acceptable for image areas. Further research of alternative cleaning methods and materials is suggested to yield conclusive results. Alumni Relations at the University of Delaware and Undergraduate Research Program.
