30|$|Generally, tissue {{engineering}} (TE) consists of 2 main approaches: cellular and acellular. Cellular approach employs small units of living cells {{for the construction}} of 3 D tissues.

40|$|Periodontitis is an {{infectious}} and inflammatory oral disease, which damages the tooth supporting structures {{and is one}} of the major causes of tooth loss in adults. Thus, periodontal diseases hinder the patient’s quality of life in terms of oral health and functions leading to significant socio-economic outbreak worldwide. Since the periodontium has extremely limited and restricted capability for self-renewal, conventional treatments have not been influential in creating significant outcomes. These limitations have opened pathways for searching new approaches for periodontal regeneration. In recent years, periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) have been considered to be the promising cell source for periodontal regeneration in cell-based tissue engineering approaches. PDLSCs have been experimentally used for the regeneration of periodontal tissues and eventually demonstrated significant results in general. <b>Cell</b> <b>sheet</b> technology steps into tissue engineering and regenerative medicine as a novel approach by overcoming many drawbacks coupled with traditional tissue engineering methods. Using this approach, cells could be harvested as an intact <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> by adjusting the dish surface temperature. In this study, PDLSCs and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used to create three-dimensional (3 -D) <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> constructs to assess the periodontal regeneration potential in vitro and in vivo. PDLSCs were characterized for their “stemness” and multilineage differentiation potentials. PDLSCs and HUVECs were used to create 3 -D <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> constructs and unraveled the synergistic effects in different ratios of these cells. The present study suggested that co-culture groups exhibited higher level of osteo/odontogenic gene expressions compared to monoculture <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> groups. Moreover, vessel-like structures were observed in a <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> assembly in vitro. Further studies would be necessary to evaluate the exact parameters required for the development of such vessel-like structures and angiogenesis in 3 -D <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> constructs in vitro. In vivo assessment of tooth-root coated with three different combinations of triple-layered <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> groups (PDLSCs-PDLSCs-PDLSCs, PDLSCs-HUVECs-PDLSCs and Co-culture group) showed periodontal ligament like tissue regeneration around implanted roots compared with control groups. Positive immunohistochemical staining for periostin and bone sialoprotein further confirmed periodontal regeneration, cementogenesis, and osteogenesis in <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> groups. Immunohistochemistry for human mitochondrial antibody was used to verify the cells of human origin. Vessel-like structures were observed in periodontal compartment of transplanted <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> groups (PDLSCs-HUVECs-PDLSCs and co-culture) facilitating the successful integration of host vasculature with transplanted <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> constructs. In summary, the results suggested that HUVECs enhanced the osteo/odontogenic potentials of PDLSCs in 3 -D <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> model with formation of rudimentary vessel-like structures in vitro. Furthermore, following the transplantation of these <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> constructs with tooth roots into the subcutaneous space of immunodeficient mice, periodontal ligament like tissues were observed around transplanted constructs with the positive sign of cementogenesis and osteogenesis. In translational terms, current accumulated data would be a preliminary foundation for future studies and this novel 3 -D PDLSCs-HUVECs cell sheet-based approach may be potentially beneficial and thus encourage for future periodontal regenerative therapy. It is evidently proven that the use of above approach might unleash the potential beyond the stipulated and conventional frameworks of dentistry. published_or_final_versionDentistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

There is considerable morphologic diversity among adherens junctions. Those that tie cells to one another are seen as isolated streaks or spots, or as bands that completely encircle the cell. The band-type of adherens junctions is associated with bundles of actin filaments that also encircle the cell just below the plasma membrane. Spot-like adherens junctions help cells adhere to extracellular matrix both in vivo and in vitro where they are called focal adhesions.

50|$|Regional {{specification}} is {{initiated by}} the presence of cytoplasmic determinants {{in one part of the}} zygote. The cells that contain the determinant become a signaling center and emit an inducing factor. Because the inducing factor is produced in one place, diffuses away, and decays, it forms a concentration gradient, high near the source cells and low further away. The remaining cells of the embryo, which do not contain the determinant, are competent to respond to different concentrations by upregulating specific developmental control genes. This results in a series of zones becoming set up, arranged at progressively greater distance from the signaling center. In each zone a different combination of developmental control genes is upregulated. These genes encode transcription factors which upregulate new combinations of gene activity in each region. Among other functions, these transcription factors control expression of genes conferring specific adhesive and motility properties on the cells in which they are active. Because of these different morphogenetic properties, the cells of each germ layer move to form sheets such that the ectoderm ends up on the outside, mesoderm in the middle, and endoderm on the inside. Morphogenetic movements not only change the shape and structure of the embryo, but by bringing <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> into new spatial relationships they also make possible new phases of signaling and response between them.|$|E
50|$|The main {{processes}} {{involved in}} the embryonic development of animals are: regional specification, morphogenesis, cell differentiation, growth, and the overall control of timing explored in evolutionary developmental biology. Regional specification refers to the processes that create spatial pattern in a ball or sheet of initially similar cells. This generally involves the action of cytoplasmic determinants, located within parts of the fertilized egg, and of inductive signals emitted from signaling centers in the embryo. The early stages of regional specification do not generate functional differentiated cells, but cell populations committed to develop to a specific region {{or part of the}} organism. These are defined by the expression of specific combinations of transcription factors. Morphogenesis relates to the formation of three-dimensional shape. It mainly involves the orchestrated movements of <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> and of individual cells. Morphogenesis is important for creating the three germ layers of the early embryo (ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm) and for building up complex structures during organ development. Cell differentiation relates specifically to the formation of functional cell types such as nerve, muscle, secretory epithelia etc. Differentiated cells contain large amounts of specific proteins associated with the cell function. Growth involves both an overall increase in size, and also the differential growth of parts (allometry) which contributes to morphogenesis. Growth mostly occurs through cell division but also through changes of cell size and the deposition of extracellular materials. The control of timing of events and the integration of the various processes with one another is the least well understood area of the subject. It remains unclear whether animal embryos contain a master clock mechanism or not.|$|E

Each <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> area was 4, 500 mm 2. Dispersion analysis of all plaque counts in the study revealed that the percentage error, in the absence of overcrowding, fluctuated within a range of 7 to 36 % about a mean value of about 17 %, which is close to what is expected from purely statistical variation in sampling. Overcrowding with Mahoney virus, a mixture of particles producing either rapidly or slowly expanding plaques, resulted primarily from the obscuring effect produced as rapidly expanding plaques obliterated infected foci produced by virus particles responsible for slow-forming plaques. Overcrowding occurred at plaque levels in excess of 35 to 40 per <b>cell</b> <b>sheet.</b> Overcrowding with Mahoney LP virus, a strain derived from a rapidly expanding Mahoney plaque which produced uniformly expanding plaques, did not occur until counts in excess of 60 to 70 per <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> were reached.

Titanium-reinforced osteogenic cell sheet construction was conditional on various technical and material factors: <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> needed to be double-sided and sandwich the titanium plate, and the titanium plates needed to be micro thin and contain apertures to allow close apposition of the two <b>cell</b> <b>sheets.</b> Critically, titanium plates needed to be UV-photofunctionalized to ensure adherence and retention of <b>cell</b> <b>sheets.</b> Single-sided <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> or double-sided <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> on as-made titanium contracted and deformed within 4 days of incubation.

Precise measurements of the rate of migration for 5 day showed that the cells accelerated at a uniform rate of 0. 24 micrometer. hr- 2 and, by extrapolation, possessed an apparent initial velocity of 2. 8 micrometer. hr- 1 at the time of wounding.

Method: Human PDLSCs were isolated and characterized by flow-cytometry, and HUVECs were used for construction of <b>cell</b> <b>sheet.</b> Both types of cells were seeded on temperature responsive culture dishes with PDLSCs alone, HUVECs alone, and various ratios of these cells (1 : 1, 2 : 1, 5 : 1 and 1 : 5) to obtain confluent <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> layers. The expression of odontogenic pathway markers including ALP, BSP, RUNX 2 were analyzed at 3 and 7 days using RT-PCR. Further ALP protein quantification was done at 7 and 14 days using alkaline phosphatase assay. The calcium nodule formation was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively by Alizarin Red assay. Histological evaluations of three <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> constructs treated with different combinations (PDLSCs-PDLSCs-PDLSCs/PDLSCs-HUVECs-PDLSCs/Co-Culture 2 : 1 PDLSCs-HUVECs) were performed with H&E and immunofluorescence straining. Statistical analysis was done by t-test(p< 0. 05). Result: Significantly higher ALP gene expression was observed at 3 days in 1 : 1 (PDLSCs:HUVECs) (2. 52 ± 0. 67) and 5 : 1 (4. 05 ± 1. 07) co-culture groups compared with other groups(p< 0. 05), being consistent with ALP protein quantification. However, BSP and RUNX 2 genes expressions were higher at 7 days compared to that detected at 3 days. Significant calcium mineralization was detected and quantified by Alizarin red assay at 14 days in 1 : 1 (1323. 55 ± 6. 54 µm) and 5 : 1 (994. 67 ± 4. 15 µm) co-cultures as compared with mono-culture cell sheets(p< 0. 05).

These results suggest that autologous hiPSC-RPE <b>cell</b> <b>sheets</b> may serve as a useful form of graft for use in tissue replacement therapy for AMD...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring Drosophila embryogenesis, a <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> movement, dorsal closure, allows {{establishment}} of the dorsal epidermis. In this morphogenetic process, lateral epithelia undergo a dramatic movement toward the dorsal midline. In the mutant hemipterous (hep), spreading of the epithelia is blocked; in genetically sensitized hep embryos, <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> movement can be arrested at any time, indicating hep requirement in maintaining this morphogenetic activity. Further, hep is required for expression in the dorsal epithelium edges of another dorsal closure gene, puckered. The HEP protein is homologous to the Jun kinase kinase (JNKK) group of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs). These data suggest that hep functions in a novel Drosophila MAPK pathway, controlling puckered expression and morphogenetic activity of the dorsal epidermis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 17 Heart failure (HF) is {{the leading}} cause of death in {{developed}} countries. Regenerative 18 medicine has the potential to drastically improve treatment for advanced HF. Stem 19 cell-based medicine has received attention as a promising candidate therapy over the past 20 decade; however, it has not yet realized this potential in terms of reliability. The <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> 21 is an innovative technology for constructing aligned graft cells, and several cell sources 22 have been investigated for making a feasible <b>cell</b> <b>sheet.</b> The most representative thus far 23 is skeletal myoblast, although such cells raise the issue of arrhythmogenicity. 24 Regenerative cardiomyocytes (CM) derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSC), such as 25 embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells, are the most promising, because a 26 myocardial <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> (MCS) constructed with regenerative CM can potentially enable 27 contraction recovery and electromechanical coupling with host CM. The functional 28 outcomes of experimental MCS are reduction of ventricular wall stress and paracrine 29 effects rather than contraction recovery. Several technical obstacles still hamper the 30 clinical application of MCSs, with graft survival the most pivotal issue. Ischemia, 3...|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} {{of stem cell}} technology and <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> engineering improved the potential use of <b>cell</b> <b>sheet</b> products in regenerative medicine. This review will discuss the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in cell sheet-based tissue engineering. Besides their adhesiveness to plastic surfaces and their extensive differentiation potential in vitro, MSCs are easily accessible, expandable in vitro with acceptable genomic stability, and few ethical issues. With all these advantages, they are extremely well suited for cell sheet-based tissue engineering. This review {{will focus on the}} use of MSC sheets in osteogenic tissue engineering. Potential application techniques with or without scaffolds and/or grafts will be discussed. Finally, the importance of osteogenic induction of these MSC sheets in orthopaedic applications will be demonstrated...|$|R
