40|$|The waste {{management}} is transforming {{in a more}} and more complex effort, with environmental and economic relief. The urban solid wastes are mainly produced in {{the final phase of}} the consumption, particularly by the food packaging increasing. As concerns materials recovery and recycling, a key condition for the development of selective wastes collection is the capability of recycling plants. The limitation {{in the use of the}} secondary raw materials, in fact, is due to their quality, however lower than the primary raw materials one. In the case <b>of</b> <b>cullets,</b> it is necessary to assure a high quality level. The technological characteristics of the glass produced by using recycled materials are deeply influenced by the chemical composition <b>of</b> <b>cullets</b> and the presence of extraneous items in the recycled mixture. The recognition <b>of</b> <b>cullets</b> produced by crushing is important in order to recycle the glass for the industrial uses. The aim of this work is to evaluate the correspondence between the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>cullets</b> and the characteristics of the corresponding original bottles, in order to identify in cullets the physical and mechanical properties of glass that constitutes the bottles. A feasible analytical procedure able to associate the cullets characteristics to the original bottles, independently from the effect produced during the crushing, has been pointed out...|$|R

Additionally, the activation <b>of</b> <b>cullet</b> pastes with NaOH solution has been examined. For comparative reasons complementary samples using Lignite Fly Ash were made. The chemical behaviour between the cement and cullet was determined by XRD and SEM observations. Further measurements of the compressive strength of the pastes and the pozzolanic activity <b>of</b> the <b>cullet</b> were carried out {{as well as the}} properties of the fresh mortars.

40|$|Due to the {{imperative}} need for recycling, {{the present study}} was focused on the exploitation of domestic and industrial waste and particularly of finely ground glass cullet in three applications of structural materials. Firstly, the possible use <b>of</b> glass <b>cullet</b> in cementitious materials either as a binder, aggregate or filler was studied. A second study sector was the utilization <b>of</b> glass <b>cullet</b> for the production of foam glass.

30|$|Recycled glass {{aggregate}} {{is potentially}} able to improve resistance to freeze–thaw attack, drying shrinkage and abrasion of mortars and concretes (Carsana et al. 2014), {{thanks to the}} low porosity and water absorption capacity. Moreover, waste glass can also improve the resistance to high temperatures (Guo et al. 2015; Rashad 2014). Since the increasing demands in construction as functional, aesthetic, economic and insulating criteria has to be fulfilled, the use <b>of</b> <b>cullet</b> <b>of</b> different colours in cementitious materials is a good alternative.|$|R

In the early 16th and 17th centuries glassmaking (the manufacture of glass from raw materials) and glassworking (the creation of objects from glass) occurred within the same glasshouse.

40|$|Issue: Glass {{container}} {{manufacturers are}} using increasing amounts <b>of</b> recycled glass <b>cullet.</b> While reducing {{the demand for}} natural resources, the use <b>of</b> <b>cullet</b> is also cost-effective from a manufacturing standpoint. Cullet melts at a lower temperature than raw materials, reducing the demand for energy and lowering production costs. Further energy savings {{can be achieved by}} using furnace exhaust gases to preheat the <b>cullet.</b> One method <b>of</b> preheating involves direct transmission of furnace exhaust through a cullet medium. Another approach involves passing the cullet through a vertical funnel that is heated externally by the furnace exhaust. Preheating cullet also helps to promote a longer furnace life. This best practice explains the benefits <b>of</b> using preheated <b>cullet</b> in the manufacturing of glass containers. Preheater designs using direct and indirect heat transmission are also discussed. Best Practice: Typical glass container manufacturing furnaces are capable of producing from 100 to 400 tons of glass per day. Because recycled glass melts at lower temperatures than raw batch materials, it requires less furnace energy during production. Studies show that every 10 % increase in the amount <b>of</b> <b>cullet</b> used reduces melting energy by about 2 %. Reducing the energy input reduces fuel consumption, and ultimately helps reduce the level of nitrogen emissions produced by the furnace. Preheating cullet with the furnace exhaust gas allows further reduction in the melting energy. The exac...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, soda-lime-silica amber glasses with {{coloured}} (green and amber) cullet content up to 65 % were produced. The glasses were characterised optically, mechanically and chemically. The maximum percentages <b>of</b> coloured <b>cullet</b> {{used in the}} amber glass production were determined so that the final colour would fall within the acceptable colour limits of the amber area. The content of tire reducing components, such as carbon, in the batch were modified correspondingly.

The redox of all the batches was calculated according to Simpson & Myers((1)) factors.

40|$|ERCo has {{developed}} a laser-based technology for rapid compositional measurements of batch, real-time sorting <b>of</b> <b>cullet,</b> and in-situ measurements of molten glass. This technology, termed LIBS (Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy) can {{determine whether or not}} the batch was formulated accurately in order to control glass quality. It {{can also be used to}} determine if individual batch ingredients are within specifications. In the case <b>of</b> <b>cullet</b> feedstocks, the sensor can serve as part of a system to sort cullet by color and ensure that it is free of contaminants. In-situ compositional measurements of molten glass are achieved through immersing a LIBS probe directly into the melt in a glass furnace. This technology has been successfully demonstrated in ERCo’s LIBS laboratory for batch analysis, cullet sorting, and glass melt measurements. A commercial batch analyzer has been operating in a PPG fiberglass plant since August 2004. LIBS utilizes a highly concentrated laser pulse to rapidly vaporize and ionize nanograms of the material being studied. As this vapor cools, it radiates light at specific wavelengths corresponding to the elemental constituents (e. g. silicon, aluminum, iron) of the material. The strengths of the emissions correlate to the concentrations of each of the elemental constituents. By collecting the radiated light with a spectrometer capable of resolving and measuring these wavelengths, the elemental composition of the sample is found...|$|R
40|$|Issue: Glass {{aggregate}} {{can include}} 100 % glass cullet, or a mixture <b>of</b> <b>cullet</b> and natural aggregate.

40|$|Issue: Recycled glass {{aggregate}} is {{a relatively}} new construction material. To promote its use, studies have been conducted to determine its engineering performance and environmental impact. The studies suggest that cullet aggregate is strong, clean, and safe to use. However, because cullet aggregate remains a relatively unfamiliar material, safety concerns surrounding the use of “crushed glass ” may discourage its use. These concerns generally involve the potential for skin cuts and punctures, and exposure to glass dust during transportation, handling, and placement. In order to ease concerns and to maintain a safe working environment, information about necessary precautions is needed. Best Practice: The most common health concern regarding the use <b>of</b> <b>cullet</b> aggregates is the potential for skin cuts or penetration. Workers may come into physical contact with cullet particles during transportation or placement <b>of</b> the <b>cullet.</b> Experience has shown that cullet 3 / 4 inch or smaller presents no greater cut or penetration hazard than fractured natural aggregates such as crushed rock. Therefore, the same safety precautions for working with natural aggregates should also be followed when working with cullet. Exposure to glass dust is another health concern with cullet aggregate. Studies have been conducted to determine whether glass dust contains crystalline silica, a known carcinogen. These studies have found tha...|$|R
40|$|Issue: Ceramic {{contaminants}} in recycled glass cullet {{can result in}} inclusions in finished glass products. Ceramic inclusions can lead to eventual fracturing or breakage of the glass container, especially if the container is filled with a pressurized liquid like soda or beer. Providing a <b>cullet</b> supply free <b>of</b> ceramic contaminants is generally {{the responsibility of the}} materials recovery facility (MRF). Many MRFs physically remove ceramic contaminants from the cullet, either manually or with automated systems. An alternative to complete ceramic removal is to reduce the entire cullet supply to No. 12 mesh or smaller. Called “fine-sizing”, this size reduction enables most ceramics to melt in the furnace. This Best Practice describes some prevalent technologies for fine-sizing cullet. Best Practice: This best practice considers two approaches to fine-sizing glass cullet: vertical shaft grinding and flexible impact pulverizing. Moisture control is also discussed.

40|$|Issue: Fiberglass {{insulation}} manufacturing {{has grown}} {{to be one of}} the largest uses for recycled glass. Because fiberglass does not have glass’s clarity, there is an assumption among some that fiberglass raw materials can tolerate higher levels of contaminants than container manufacturing. In fact, metal, organic, and ceramic contaminants can be costly to fiberglass quality and production equipment. Best Practice: During fiberglass production, raw batch materials and glass cullet are continuously added to the furnace. After melting and “fining, ” the molten glass is spun into fibers by a process called fiberizing. To ensure production <b>of</b> consistent fibers, <b>cullet</b> must meet specifications for major and minor oxide chemical composition, color consistency, and contaminant levels. Major and Minor Oxide Chemical Composition. The chemical composition <b>of</b> <b>cullet</b> as raw batch material for fiberglass should fall within the ranges listed in the table. Variations in major oxide concentration can affect both the viscosity and emissivity of the glass melt. Viscosity is a measure of flow resistance, while emissivity is the ability of a material to emit heat through radiation. Both of these properties affect the attenuation ability of the molten glass during fiber formation. In addition, a shift in a major oxide concentration can cause fluctuations in the electrical resistivity of the melt. This requires an adjustment of transformer settings controlling the power input to the furnace, as well as creating changes in heat flow patterns, current paths, and temperature distribution, all of which are undesirable during stable furnace operations. Minor and trace oxide composition <b>of</b> the batch <b>cullet</b> is also very important. Oxides such as CoO, Cr 2 O, and FeO can influence infrared heat transmission, heat transfer during melting, and rate of fiber cooling. These factors will affect fiber attenuation, leading to variability in the fiber diameters and lengths...|$|R

40|$|Issue: Container {{manufacturing}} is {{the primary}} market for recycled glass cullet in the United States. Although all container manufacturers use some recycled cullet in glass batches, {{there is a lack}} of uniform specifications for both recycled glass and furnace-ready cullet. This can represent a significant market barrier to processors of recycled glass seeking to access the primary market. Often processors design systems to meet the needs of specific manufacturers. This can leave processors vulnerable to changes in the consumption patterns of a single manufacturer. Industry-wide quality requirements are needed to ensure that suppliers have equal access to container manufacturing markets. Further, specifications written at the corporate level are subject to interpretation at the plant level. Plant engineers may have expectations <b>of</b> <b>cullet</b> that are more or less stringent than the written specifications. As a result, the quality assurance procedures undertaken by those managers may tend to be more subjective than specifications suggest. Best Practice: The next page contains a specification derived from existing specifications and interviews with processors and users. It may serve to educate those unfamiliar with cullet specifications and as a starting point for development of uniform specifications. Implementation:Incipient trading in recycled glass on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) may help to open an industry-wide discussion for the establishment of uniform specifications. Whether or not CBOT trading succeeds, that discussion should continue within the glass manufacturing industry. Benefits: The existence of well-defined industry specifications can potentially be a benefit to both processors and users <b>of</b> furnace-ready <b>cullet.</b> Processors can design their systems knowing that they are not subject to the whims of a single buyer.
