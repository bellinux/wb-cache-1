2500|$|The {{investigation}} {{focused on}} the foam strike from the very beginning. Incidents of debris strikes from ice and foam causing damage during take-off were already well known, and had damaged orbiters, most noticeably during STS-45, STS-27, and STS-87. After the loss of Columbia, NASA concluded that mistakes during installation were the likely cause of foam loss, and retrained employees at Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana to apply foam without defects. Tile damage had also been traced to ablating insulating material from the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fuel</b> tank in the past. The composition of the foam insulation had been changed in 1997 to exclude the use of freon, a chemical that is suspected to cause ozone depletion; while NASA was exempted from legislation phasing out CFCs, the agency chose to change the foam nonetheless. STS-107 used an older [...] "lightweight tank" [...] (a design that was succeeded by the [...] "superlightweight tank", both being upgrades from the original space shuttle external tank) where the foam was sprayed on to the larger cylindrical surfaces using the newer freon-free foam. However, the bipod ramps were manufactured from BX-250 foam which was excluded from the EPA regulations and did use the original freon formula. The composition change did {{not contribute to the}} accident. In any case, the original formulation had shown frequent foam losses, as discussed earlier in this article.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cryogenic</b> <b>fuels</b> can {{be placed}} into two categories: inert and {{flammable}} or combustible. Both types exploit the large liquid to gas volume ratio that occurs when liquid transitions to gas phase. The feasibility of <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fuels</b> is associated with {{what is known as}} a high mass flow rate. With regulation, the high-density energy of <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fuels</b> is utilized to produce thrust in rockets and controllable consumption of fuel. The following sections provide further detail.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cryogenic</b> <b>fuels</b> are fuels {{that require}} storage at {{extremely}} low temperatures {{in order to}} maintain them in a liquid state. These fuels are used in machinery that operates in space (e.g. rocket ships and satellites) because ordinary fuel cannot be used there, due to absence of an environment that supports combustion (on earth, oxygen is abundant in the atmosphere, whereas in human-explorable space, oxygen is virtually non-existent). <b>Cryogenic</b> <b>fuels</b> most often constitute liquefied gases such as liquid hydrogen.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the liquid}} oxygen/liquid methane {{bipropellant}} mix is considerably easier and safer to handle than hydrazine, the propellants can catch fire and <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fuel</b> tanks and Dewars can explode.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cryogenic</b> <b>fuels</b> are non-pollutants and therefore, if spilled, are no {{risk to the}} environment. There will be no need {{to clean}} up {{hazardous}} waste after a spill.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cryogenic</b> <b>fuels</b> are {{environmentally}} {{cleaner than}} gasoline or fossil fuels. Among other things, the greenhouse gas rate {{could potentially be}} reduced by 11%-20% using LNG as opposed to gasoline when transporting goods.|$|R

50|$|In 1966, General Motors {{developed}} the concept vehicle Electrovan, {{based on the}} GMC Handi-Van. The vehicle used a Union Carbide <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fuel</b> cell to power a 115-horsepower electric motor. It never went into production due to cost issues and safety concerns.|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{non-toxic}} tendencies, <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fuels</b> are denser than air. As such, {{they can}} lead to asphyxiation. If leaked, the liquid will boil into a very dense, cold gas and if inhaled, could be fatal.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cryogenic</b> <b>fuels</b> have {{a higher}} mass flow rate than fossil fuels and {{therefore}} produce more thrust and power when combusted for use in an engine. This means that engines will run farther on less fuel overall than modern gas engines.|$|R

50|$|The Tupolev Tu-244 was a {{proposed}} supersonic transport (SST) aircraft, {{developed from the}} Tu-144. It implemented novel features such as <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fuel</b> to enable flight distances of up to 10,000 km (6,214 mi) and would have carried up to 300 passengers.

50|$|A {{cryogenic}} {{rocket engine}} is a rocket engine {{that uses a}} <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fuel</b> or oxidizer, that is, its fuel or oxidizer (or both) are gases liquefied and stored at very low temperatures.

50|$|There was {{a concept}} study {{for a new}} medium-size {{launcher}} based on Vega and Ariane 5 elements. This launcher would use an Ariane 5 P230 first stage, a Vega P80 second stage and an Ariane 5 third stage using either storable or <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fuel.</b> The addition of Soyuz to the Arianespace launch vehicle lineup removed momentum from this initiative.|$|E
50|$|Relative {{to their}} mass, {{traditional}} hypergolic propellants are less energetic than such cryogenic propellant combinations as liquid hydrogen / liquid oxygen or liquid methane / liquid oxygen. A launch vehicle that uses hypergolic propellant must therefore carry a greater mass of fuel {{than one that}} uses these <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fuels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{support systems}} {{included}} storage dewars for <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fuels</b> {{and a large}} water reservoir. Smaller buildings included a block house for observation, a pump house, a helium compressor shelter, and a liquid hydrogen pump vaporizer shelter.

50|$|Various {{advanced}} reusable spacecraft and {{hypersonic aircraft}} designs {{have been proposed}} to employ heat shields made from temperature-resistant metal alloys that incorporated a refrigerant or <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fuel</b> circulating through them.

The second was an Ariane 4 derivative called H-25. It {{was based on an}} H10 upper stage with a Vinci rocket engine and 25 tonnes ST of <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fuel.</b> Depending on the method of deceleration, the payload to SSO is between 1481 and 2788 kg. The third was a large cryogenic upper stage, called H-185, based on an alternative, yet-to-be-developed Ariane 5 main stage with 185 tonnes ST of <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fuel.</b> Its payload to SSO is 5000 kg.|$|E
50|$|Some rocket engines use {{regenerative}} cooling, {{the practice}} of circulating their <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fuel</b> around the nozzles before the fuel is pumped into the combustion chamber and ignited. This arrangement was first suggested by Eugen Sänger in the 1940s. The Saturn V rocket that sent the first manned missions to the moon used this design element, which is still in use today.|$|E
50|$|Another use of <b>cryogenics</b> is <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fuels</b> for rockets {{with liquid}} {{hydrogen}} {{as the most}} widely used example. Liquid oxygen (LOX) is even more widely used but as an oxidizer, not a fuel. NASA's workhorse space shuttle used cryogenic hydrogen/oxygen propellant as its primary means of getting into orbit. LOX is also widely used with RP-1 kerosene, a non-cryogenic hydrocarbon, such as in the rockets built for the Soviet space program by Sergei Korolev.|$|R

50|$|Vulcain is {{a family}} of European first stage rocket engines for Ariane 5 and the future Ariane 6. Its {{development}} began in 1988 and the first flight was completed in 1996. The updated version of the engine, Vulcain 2, was first successfully flown in 2005. Both {{members of the family}} use liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fuel.</b> The new version under development for Ariane 6 will be called Vulcain 2.1.|$|E
50|$|The {{exposure}} on {{the surface}} that this procedure entailed was the great weakness of the Atlas F. It was exposed and vulnerable during this time. Titan II and Minuteman missiles could be launched from within their silos, thereby eliminating this vulnerability. Also, since the Titan did not use a <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fuel</b> or oxydizer, and the Minuteman was a solid fuel rocket, they could be stored fully fueled and ready to launch within a few minutes.|$|E
5000|$|Transfer {{of liquid}} {{propellants}} in microgravity {{is complicated by}} the uncertain distribution of liquid and gasses within a tank. Propellant settling at an in-space depot is thus more challenging than in even a slight gravity field. ULA plans to use the DMSP-18 mission to flight-test centrifugal propellant settling as a <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fuel</b> management technique that might be used in future propellant depots.
