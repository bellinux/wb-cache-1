40|$|Phosphorescent organic light {{emitting}} diodes are perspective in lighting technologies due to high efficient electroluminescence. Not only phosphorescent dyes but also host materials are important aspect to be considered in the devices where they are a problem for blue {{light emitting}} phosphorescent molecules. Carbazole derivative 3, 6 -di(9 -carbazolyl) - 9 -(2 -ethylhexyl) carbazole (TCz 1) is a good candidate and has shown excellent results in thermally evaporated films. This paper presents the studies of electrical properties and energy structure in thin films of spin-coated TCz 1 and thermally evaporated tris[2 -(2, 4 -difluorophenyl) pyridine]iridium(III) (Ir(Fppy) 3). The 0. 46 eV difference of electron <b>conduction</b> <b>level</b> between TCz 1 and Ir(Fppy) 3 compounds was obtained from the cyclic voltammetry and photoconductivity measurements. Temperature modulated space charge limited current (TM-SCLC) method is used to measure the local trapping states for charge carrier in the energy gap. The TM-SCLC measurements for the system TCz 1 + 8 wt. % Ir(Fppy) 3 show a trapping state with the value of 0. 4 eV which is comparable to the <b>conduction</b> <b>level</b> difference of these materials. It allows to conclude that Ir(Fppy) 3 molecules act as electron traps in the TCz 1 matrix and the TM-SCLC method is applicable to investigate dopants as trapping states. To show the trap effect, an organic light emitting diode was made where the electroluminescent layer was a spin-coated host-guest system of TCz 1 with incorporated 8 wt. % Ir(Fppy) 3...|$|E

The lateral {{size of the}} dots ranges from 7 to 62 nm. The emissions from the dots with 26, 52 and 62 nm size have a blue shift under pressure, indicating that these quantum dots have the normal type-I structure with lowest conduction band at the Gamma -valley.

METHODS: Patients with fibromyalgia (n= 48) were given a clinical interview in a randomized 2 × 2 design, in which interviewer empathic or inattentive behavior (scenario A) and the emotional or neutral content of the interview (scenario B) were manipulated. Electrodermal activity (EDA) was measured during the interview. The patients' affective state (PANAS) and patient satisfaction were also assessed. RESULTS: In scenario A {{a significant main effect}} of empathy was found, indicating an increased tonic EDA (skin <b>conduction</b> <b>level,</b> SCL) during the empathy condition (p<. 05). In scenario B there was a main effect of empathy (p<. 01) and a significant empathy×content interaction effect (p<. 01). There was a strong positive association between empathy and patient satisfaction (p<. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: Empathic statements by the interviewer were associated with increased SCL in patients, most so in interviews with emotional content.

The Zeeman splitting of the electron ground states is almost isotropic. The Zeeman splitting of the hole ground states is highly anisotropic, with an anisotropy factor of 918 at B= 0. 1 T. The Zeeman splittings {{of some of the}} electron and hole excited states are also highly anisotropic. It is because of the spin-orbit coupling which couples the spin states with the anisotropic space-wave functions due to the anisotropic shape. It is found that when the magnetic quantum number of total orbital angular momentum is nearly zero, the spin states couple with the space-wave functions very little, and the Zeeman splitting is isotropic. Conversely, if the magnetic quantum number of total orbital angular momentum is not zero, the space-wave functions in the degenerate states are different, and the Zeeman splitting is highly anisotropic. The electron and hole Stark shifts of oblate quantum dots are also highly anisotropic. The decrease of band gap with increasing nitrogen composition is much more obvious in the smaller radius case because the lowest <b>conduction</b> <b>level</b> is increased by the quantum confinement effect and is closer to the nitrogen level.

In recent years, vertically aligned one-dimensional ZnO nanostructures have gained great interest for dye-synthesized solar cells [4, 5], as a promising alternative to mesoporous TiO 2 films [6]. Both ZnO and TiO 2 have similar bandgaps, while the higher electron mobility and direct electrical pathways provided by vertically aligned ZnO nanorods/nanowires are favorable for electronic transport [4]. Low cost and large-scale chemical solution-based techniques have been developed to synthesize anisotropic single crystalline ZnO nanostructures on a variety of substrates [5]. Despite the expected advantages, the use of ZnO nanostructures in combination with dyes has been hampered due to their instability in acidic dyes leading to the formation of Zn 2 +/dye agglomerates, an insulating layer blocking the electron injection efficiency from the dye molecules to ZnO [4]. On the other hand, semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots (QDs) [7] have been considered as promising photosensitizers for TiO 2 and ZnO-based quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) [8] due to their intrinsic attractive properties: bandgap tunable both by the choice of material and by the size offering the possibility to match the solar spectrum, and to align energy levels both in respect to the <b>conduction</b> <b>level</b> of the electron-conducting nanostructure and to redox potential of the electrolyte, and high extinction coefficients [8 – 12].

40|$|Electroluminescence {{excitation}} mechanisms {{have been}} investigated in epoxy resin under divergent and uniform field situations. Metallic wires embedded in the resin were used to produce field divergence whereas film samples were metallised to obtain a uniform field. Electroluminescence under divergent field was stimulated by an impulse voltage. Light was emitted on {{the positive and negative}} fronts of the square pulses when the field exceeded 20 kV/mm at the wire surface, with equal intensity and without polarity dependence. There was evidence of space charge accumulation around the wires in multiple-pulse experiments. Charge injection and extraction occurring at both fronts of the pulse provide the condition for EL excitation. Further excitation of the EL during the plateau of the voltage pulse is prevented by the opposite field of the trapped charge. Field computation with and without space charge supports the proposed interpretation. A DC voltage was used for the uniform field experiments. A continuous level of electroluminescence is found at 175 kV/mm. Charging/discharging current measurements and space charge profile analyses using the pulsed electro-acoustic (PEA) technique were performed at different fields up to the EL level. Dipolar orientation generates a long lasting transient current that prevents the <b>conduction</b> <b>level</b> being reached within the experimental protocol (one hour poling time). The continuous EL emission is nevertheless associated with a regime where the conduction becomes dominant over the orientational polarization. Polarization and space charge contribute to the PEA charge profiles. Homo-charge injection at anode and cathode is seen at 20 kV/mm and a penetration of positive space charge in the bulk is detected above 100 kV/mm, suggesting an excitation of the continuous EL by bipolar charge recombination. 2...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess, in {{otosclerosis}} surgery, {{whether the}} vein or the tragal perichondrium in stapedotomy with interposition yields the better long-term hearing outcome. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review of prospectively collected audiometric data of 452 ears. SETTING: Academic tertiary otology-neurotology referral center. PATIENTS: Four hundred fifty-two stapedotomies with interposition were performed in 412 patients (bilateral in 40 patients) by the senior author (R. C.) between 1987 and 1998. A tragal perichondrium graft {{was used in}} 314 cases and a vein graft was used in 138 cases as sealing material of the oval window. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Audiometric data were recorded at 4 months, at 1 year, and at 3 years after surgery after American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines, except for thresholds at 3 kHz, which were not available and which were replaced with those at 4 kHz. RESULTS: There were no significant intergroup differences in initial or late postoperative hearing outcome with regard {{to change in the}} pure-tone average bone conduction and air-bone gaps, or sensorineural hearing loss. Ears treated with a vein graft showed statistically better postoperative 2 -kHz air-bone gap closure (p = 0. 0157), but the pure-tone average air-bone gap difference was not significant. Postoperative air-bone gap closure to within 10 dB was achieved in 91 % of cases in the vein group and in 76 % of cases in the perichondrium group. Specific study of the bone <b>conduction</b> <b>level</b> at 4 kHz showed a sensorineural hearing loss greater than 10 dB in 8 % of cases in the vein group and in 11 % of cases in the perichondrium group.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this dissertation is centered around the phenomena of correlations between members of a system, and how these correlations lead to unique effects which the system is in a non-equilibrium state. The systems described in this work are divided into two sections: dynamical systems and networks. The work on dynamical systems is focused on how correlated systems can gradually evolve when strongly driven. The work on networks is focused on how percolation is affected by correlations. Dynamical systems focuses on the motion of particles {{in the presence of}} an external driving force, specifically focusing on nonlinear effects observable in three different examples of correlated systems which are strongly driven by an external field which is rapidly oscillating in time. The first system is a classical system of coupled oscillators, the second is a quantum system with avoided level crossings and the third is the <b>conduction</b> <b>level</b> of a semiconductor. All three systems are strongly driven and specifically driven far from an initial equilibrium. It is posited that these strongly driven systems will reach quasi-stationary states, where the effects of the external driving can be classified on two time scales, slow evolution and rapid oscillation. The classical system is studied as a classical field theory, the effects of the strong driving force is observed in the qualitative properties of the system's effective potential. In the presence of a strong driving force this effective potential will exhibit points whose stability will change depending on the parameters of the driving force. In the quantum systems the effects of the external driving are seen in the Floquet quasienergy spectrum. In the third system, the strong driving force results in a renormalization of the bandwidth. If the driving force is strong enough the band can be completely inverted. Again working in the Floquet representation, the inverted band will exhibit multiplication of the driving frequency, specifically the third harmonic will become the dominant frequency and the fundamental frequency will be suppressed. Correlations in networks have many different aspects, correlations can affect how a network is formed (via attachment models) or how a random process is able to percolate across a random graph. The effects of correlated percolation is discussed {{in the second part of}} this dissertation, where a process can affect single sites on a graph or a cluster of sites simultaneously. It is shown that a lower bound on the percolation threshold can be established, and this bound is dependent on the size of clusters present...|$|E

The {{dependence of the}} structural properties (e. g., NC volume variations) on the surface chemistry is discussed by considering two different surface coverages (dissociated water and hydrogens). Both prevent a pronounced reconstruction of the surface, thus ensuring a better crystalline organization of the atoms {{with respect to the}} bare NC. In particular, the results for the hydrated NC do show the largest overlap with the experimental findings. The band-gap blueshift with respect to the bulk shows up for both the bare and the hydrated NC, whereas hydrogen coverage or oxygen desorption from the bare NCs induce occupied electronic states below the <b>conduction</b> <b>levels</b> thus hindering the gap opening due to quantum confinement. These states are spatially localized in a restricted region and can be progressively annihilated by oxygen adsorption on undercoordinated surface titanium atoms. Formation energy calculations reveal that surface hydration leads to the most stable NC, in agreement with the experimental finding that the truncated bipyramidal morphology is typical of the moderate acidic environment. Oxygen desorption from the bare NC is unfavorable, thus highlighting the stabilizing role of surface oxygen stoichiometry for TiO 2.

Whereas one cannot find counterpropagating, spin-polarized states in the normal regime, below the crossover point between the uppermost (electron-like) valence and lowest (hole-like) <b>conduction</b> Landau <b>levels,</b> one can still observe such states at finite magnetic fields in the inverted regime, although these states are no longer protected by time-reversal symmetry.

We find that for fixed chemical potentials as well as for fixed carrier densities, the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility in both the normal and the inverted regimes exhibit de Haas-van Alphen oscillations, whose amplitude decreases with increasing temperature. Moreover, if the band structure is inverted, the ground-state magnetization (and consequently also the ground-state susceptibility) is discontinuous at the crossover point between the uppermost valence and lowest <b>conduction</b> Landau <b>levels.</b> At finite temperatures and/or doping, this discontinuity is canceled by the contribution from the electrons and holes and the total magnetization and susceptibility are continuous.

40|$|Traumatic pneumolabyrinth is a {{relatively}} rare entity. We report {{the case of a}} unilaterally deaf woman with pneumolabyrinth who had suffered penetrating injury 15 years ago. This past history indicated that the case was late pneumolabyrinth occurring from undiagnosed old posttraumatic perilymphatic fistula. In Japan, most cases of traumatic pneumolabyrinth are caused by penetrating injury with an ear pick. Dizziness often improves within several months. Immediate surgical intervention is recommended for hearing loss, but the hearing outcome is not satisfactory. An appropriate strategy should be selected based on the interval to surgery, bone <b>conduction</b> hearing <b>level</b> at disease onset, stapes lesions, and location of air...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} study of electronic transport through a 1, 4 ben-zene-dithiolate (BDT) ion chemically bonded to two gold leads. The model {{consists of a}} sin-gle BDT attached to two Au clusters, which are in turn attached to ideal one-dimensional leads. Extended Hückel theory is used to model the electronic structure and the Lipp-mann-Schwinger equation is solved for the lead-to-lead transmission. The current-voltage characteristics of the system are calculated using the finite temperature, finite voltage Lan-dauer formula. Different atomic configurations of the Au clusters are examined including the effects of thermally induced positional disorder of the Au atoms. We find that while in some cases there is conduction via states derived from the BDT HOMO and LUMO <b>levels,</b> <b>conduction</b> due to <b>levels</b> derived from hybrid Au cluster-BDT states often predominate. The current-voltage characteristics {{are found to be}} sensitive to the specific configuration of the Au clusters, BDT and ideal leads. I...|$|R
