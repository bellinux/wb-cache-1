2500|$|Data {{scientist}} Azhar Hamdan, {{working to}} explain the paradoxes the 2016 outcome, [...] "chief among them {{the discrepancy between the}} popular vote, which Hillary Clinton won by 2.8 million votes, and the electoral college, where Trump won 304-227", compared Trump's 30 states against Clinton's 20 states and the District of Columbia. He said that Trump outperformed Mitt Romney's 2012 results, while Clinton only just matched Barack Obama's 2012 totals. Hamdan also said that Trump was [...] "the highest vote earner of any Republican candidate ever," [...] exceeding George W. Bush's 62.04 million votes in 2004, though neither reached Clinton's 65.9 million, nor Obama's 69.5 million votes in 2008, the overall record. He concluded, with help from The Cook Political Report, that the election hinged not on Clinton's large 2.8 million overall vote margin over Trump, but rather on about 78,000 votes from only three <b>counties</b> <b>in</b> <b>Wisconsin,</b> Pennsylvania, and Michigan.|$|E
