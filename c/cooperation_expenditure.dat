40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to document {{some of the}} sources of tension which exist at both the institutional and personal level when universities and school systems attempt to collaborate on common problems. The analysis contains three malor selections: (1) sources of tension endemic in interorganizational collaboration (accepting increased possibilities of exposure, deVeloping new arrangements and learning new habits, giving up old ways of doing things, and confronting differences which may cause misunderstanding or even resentment); (2) tensions deriving from fundamental differences between the goals of school systems and the goals of universities; and(3) tensions deriving from nonessential differences between the two (differences with regard to policymaking, the written word, daily activities, attitudes toward <b>cooperation,</b> <b>expenditure</b> of funds, research and development, personnel matters, personal commitment to organization, relative status, educational and political and social views).

40|$|Its highly {{fragmented}} {{structure of}} {{local governments and}} serious horizontal fiscal imbalances make Switzerland a surprisingly powerful model for Eastern European countries that are currently facing the challenge of fiscal decentralization. In spite of the substantial differences in the tradition and current practice of intergovernmental fiscal relations, transition economies may learn valuable lessons from the Swiss case {{in the fields of}} direct democracy, horizontal <b>cooperation,</b> <b>expenditure</b> and revenue assignment, and fiscal discipline. Among other conclusions, the authors suggest that subnational authorities can effectively fend off recentralization attempts of the central government if they engage in spontaneous cooperation to enhance the efficiency of public service provision. Together with an adequate fiscal equalization scheme, interjurisdictional cooperation also permits the reconciliation of the objective of an increasing devolution of powers with the existing regional disparities. The authors also show that the principle of subsidiarity can best be safeguarded by anchoring the expenditure and revenue powers of subnational governments in the constitution or in a similarly strong law. With regard to fiscal discipline, the combination of a"golden rule"with direct democratic instruments of budget control is proven to be successful in enhancing the accountability of local politicians toward their constituencies. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper derives a three-stage Cournot duopoly {{game for}} {{research}} <b>cooperation,</b> research <b>expenditures,</b> and product-market competition. The amount of knowledge firms can absorb is made {{dependent on their}} own research efforts, e. g., firms' absorptive capacity is treated as an endogenous variable. It is shown that cooperating firms invest more in R&D than noncooperating firms if spillovers are sufficiently large. The degree of market competition is a key determinant {{of the effects of}} research cooperation on research efforts, implying that existing models, which usually assume perfect competition, might be too restrictive. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a three stage oligopoly game for R&D <b>cooperation,</b> R&D <b>expenditure</b> and product market competition. In the first stage, firms {{decide whether or}} not to conduct R&D in cooperation with other firms. In the second stage the level of R&D investment is determined. Finally, firms compete in a Cournot?oligopoly product market. While earlier models on R&D cooperation only considered process innovation, the model presented here also takes product innovation into account. It is shown that the optimal R&D investment has virtually the same structure for both process and product innovation. The main hypothesis of our theoretical model are tested in the empirical part of this paper. [...] R&D cooperation,R&D intensity,spillovers,nested logit model,Minimum Distance Estimator...|$|R
40|$|We analyse the {{relationships}} of health, education and income per capita in developed and developing countries in year 2005, {{as well as the}} main conclusions of more than sixty studies published by our Association for the period 2001 - 2009, applied to OECD countries, Latin America, Africa, Asia and World comparisons. We analyse the relationship between Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL) and health expenditure per capita in OECD countries and the conclusions show that the initiatives to increase coverage of health care to all the population in the United States is an important step to lower the relatively high value of YPLL in this country in comparison with other developed countries of Europe and other areas. Regarding developing countries we call attention to the role education to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and thus recommend to increase international <b>cooperation.</b> Health <b>Expenditure,</b> Education and Development, YPLL...|$|R

The subgame perfect equilibria of the three stage Hotelling-type model are characterized under two institutional arrangements: independant decision making at stage 2 or a joint marketing organization. The two firms will gain hum marketing <b>cooperation</b> implying more <b>expenditure</b> on advertising & marketing due to the specification of the model that both firms benefit from advertising & marketing of either firm.

40|$|This paper uses {{a survey}} of French firms active in R&D to {{identify}} the determinants of R&D outsourcing and of the ensuing trade-off between R&D subcontracting and R&D <b>cooperation.</b> Internal R&D <b>expenditures</b> increase both the probability of outsourcing {{and the number of}} R&D partners. Investment in fundamental R&D, group belonging, and the sector’s high R&D intensity positively influences the probability of R&D outsourcing but have less impact on the number of partners. R&D subcontracting is more likely than R&D cooperation when the relationship deals with generic, standardized R&D processes, as reflected in the influence of several qualitative proxies. R&D cooperation, R&D subcontracting, organizational choices. ...|$|R
40|$|The current {{development}} agenda envisages {{a substantial}} increase in volumes of development assistance along with changes in other policies which affect developing countries, including trade, debt and migration. Successful and sustainable international development <b>cooperation</b> policies and <b>expenditures</b> are believed to require a constituency for aid in donor countries. The paper explores the question of how public support for international development cooperation in donor countries can be built and nurtured. It attempts to identify factors which determine public attitudes towards development assistance and measures that can be undertaken by state authorities to exploit these factors to the advantage of a greater support for development cooperation. It reviews rationales and arguments which can be used to explain to the publics of donor countries the need of transferring a part of their national income to developing countries. It also presents approaches which have been developed by donors in order to enhance public understanding of the need for development cooperation and to strengthen support for development assistance...|$|R
40|$|Innovation performance. The fourth part {{is divided}} into three chapters. The first evaluates the inputs and outputs of {{innovation}} performance according to the main sectors of the national innovation system. The second chapter focuses on the characteristics of the business innovation performance and its effects and barriers. The third chapter evaluates the characteristics of the business IT development in the Czech Republic in the context of global trends in information society. Inputs and outputs of innovation performance (Anna Kadeřábková, Michal Beneš, Karel Muller) : The evaluation is based on the concept of national innovation system according to its inputs, specific infrastructural preconditions and outputs (scientific and technical performance). The analy-sis of inputs includes the characteristics national research and development system, describes the dynamics and structural changes of research and development sectors and specific problems of their internal structuration and mutual interfaces. The scope of inputs covers also broader factors influencing innovation performance, like the availability of the highly qualified experts, the level of scientific and technological activities, level and growth rate of government <b>expenditures,</b> <b>cooperation</b> between universi-ties with companies, availability of venture capital. Business innovation performance (Michal Beneš, Michal Pazour) : The chapter evaluates the key aspects of innovation performance of Czech enterprises, particularly using the results of latest Community Innovation Survey (2003 - 2005). The types of innovation (including non-technical), innovation activities, their effects and hamper-ing factors are studied more thoroughly. The attention is also given to the extent and type of cooperation in the innovation process and the significance of alternative information sources. The more complex view on the innovation inputs and outputs evaluate...|$|R
