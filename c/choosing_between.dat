5|$|This {{same period}} saw Royal Oak star {{alongside}} fourteen other Royal Navy {{vessels in the}} 1937 British film melodrama Our Fighting Navy, the plot of which centres around a coup in the fictional South American republic of Bianco. Royal Oak portrays a rebel battleship El Mirante, whose commander forces a British captain (played by Robert Douglas) into <b>choosing</b> <b>between</b> his lover and his duty. The film was poorly received by critics, but gained some redemption through its dramatic scenes of naval action.|$|E
5|$|After Justinian died in 565, his successor, Justin II {{refused to}} pay the large tribute to the Persians. Meanwhile, the Germanic Lombards invaded Italy; {{by the end of}} the century only a third of Italy was in Byzantine hands. Justin's successor, Tiberius II, <b>choosing</b> <b>between</b> his enemies, awarded {{subsidies}} to the Avars while taking military action against the Persians. Though Tiberius' general, Maurice, led an effective campaign on the eastern frontier, subsidies failed to restrain the Avars. They captured the Balkan fortress of Sirmium in 582, while the Slavs began to make inroads across the Danube.|$|E
5|$|The {{album is}} the band's first after joining the main Victor Entertainment roster, after {{releasing}} two albums with Victor sub-label BabeStar. After {{the release of}} Night Fishing, the band began {{looking for a new}} management company to sign a contract with. Originally, the members did not want to leave Sapporo, especially guitarist Motoharu Iwadera and bassist Ami Kusakari. Of the five management companies they were <b>choosing</b> <b>between,</b> none of them needed the band to relocate, except for Hipland Management. Vocalist Ichiro Yamaguchi realized that staying in Sapporo was against the band's goal of making music for a much wider group of listeners, and was surprised when all of the members agreed with him. In Spring 2008, the band moved to Tokyo from Hokkaido.|$|E

5|$|In November 1994, Walford {{resident}} Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney) {{takes in}} a dog he assumes to be a stray, naming him Wellard. The dog's owner, Mr Hammond, locates him and demands him back, but Wellard later returns to Albert Square {{of his own}} accord. Robbie realises he has been mistreated and has run away. Mr Hammond admits to neglecting Wellard, and allows Robbie to keep him. Wellard fathers puppies with Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp); however, the puppies are stillborn. When Robbie begins {{a relationship with a}} woman allergic to dogs, she gives him the ultimatum of <b>choosing</b> <b>between</b> her and Wellard: Robbie chooses Wellard. Several years later, when Robbie is due to leave Walford to live in India, Wellard is run over, delaying Robbie's departure. He is cared for by Robbie's sister Sonia (Natalie Cassidy), who gives him to her friend Gus (Mohammed George) after Robbie's departure. When Gus is involved in a minibus crash, Wellard is able to save his owner by leading him to a spot from where he can call the emergency services.|$|E
5|$|Similar to its predecessor, Watch Dogs 2 is an action-adventure {{game with}} stealth {{elements}} and played from a third-person perspective as protagonist Marcus Holloway, a young hacker, the game features an open world environment {{set in a}} fictionalized version of the San Francisco Bay Area, an area {{more than twice as}} large as the Chicago setting from Watch Dogs. The Bay Area consists of four different areas: San Francisco, Oakland, Marin, and Silicon Valley, all of which have different characteristics and aesthetics. Players can navigate the game's world on-foot or by the various vehicles featured in the game, such as cars, trucks, buses, cable cars, motorcycles, quad bikes and boats. The driving mechanic was overhauled and designed to be more accessible. The players can shoot their weapons while driving. Marcus also has improved acrobatic skills, and the ability to parkour around the city. Players can use different methods to approach the game's missions, <b>choosing</b> <b>between</b> the aggressive approach, in which they defeat enemies with guns which are made with a 3D printer; explosives, like mines; or Marcus' own melee weapon, a billiard ball attached to a bungee cord. Alternatively, players can use the stealth approach, in which they can evade enemies or paralyze them temporarily with Marcus' taser. Players can also complete the game through hacking alone. When players commit too many crimes, the police officers will become alerted and will attempt to arrest the player. The game upgrades system is a returning feature, with items being divided into three categories: Ghost, Aggressor, and Trickster. Players can choose their upgrades in accordance with their own playstyle.|$|E

25|$|Piotroski and Srinivasan (2008) {{examine a}} {{comprehensive}} sample of international companies that list onto U.S. and U.K. stock exchanges {{before and after}} the enactment of the Act in 2002. Using a sample of all listing events onto U.S. and U.K. exchanges from 1995â€“2006, they find that the listing preferences of large foreign firms <b>choosing</b> <b>between</b> U.S. exchanges and the LSE's Main Market did not change following SOX. In contrast, they find that the likelihood of a U.S. listing among small foreign firms <b>choosing</b> <b>between</b> the Nasdaq and LSE's Alternative Investment Market decreased following SOX. The negative effect among small firms is consistent with these companies being less able to absorb the incremental costs associated with SOX compliance. The screening of smaller firms with weaker governance attributes from U.S. exchanges is consistent with the heightened governance costs imposed by the Act increasing the bonding-related benefits of a U.S. listing.|$|E
