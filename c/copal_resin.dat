By the 18th century, Europeans found it to be a {{valuable}} ingredient in making a good wood varnish. It became widely used in the manufacture of furniture and carriages. It was also sometimes used as a picture varnish. By the late 19th and early 20th century varnish manufacturers in England and America were using it on train carriages, greatly swelling its demand.|$|E

In order to determine their botanical origin, resin samples from eight certified botanical species from Mexican Bursera were studied. The chromatographic study of their triterpenic composition allowed to establish a botanical origin related either to Bursera bipinnata or Bursera stenophylla species which triterpenic composition is identical.

50|$|The trees {{also make}} hard resins {{that are used}} to {{manufacture}} varnish, especially the resin from Hymenaea courbaril (jatobá) in Brazil. The resin that is produced in Brazil is known as South American copal, and Hymenaea verrucosa {{is the source of the}} valuable Zanzibar <b>copal.</b> <b>Resin</b> may be collected from living trees, or from the soil near the place where a tree once stood. Throughout its American range, indigenous peoples use the resin for incense and as a cement. Resin from the extinct species Hymenaea protera is the source of Dominican amber, while the extinct Hymenaea mexicana produced the resin which is the source of Mexican amber.|$|E

The recent methods have been inappropriate therefore, modification of the treatment was necessary. The dammar and <b>copal</b> <b>resin,</b> important restoration materials, {{were used in the}} experiment. HPLC-MS, HPLC-ELSD, GC-FID, GC-MS and pyrolysis GC- MS were applied. The concentration of fatty acids in the historical sculpture was determined by GC-MS, and it was compared to the content of fatty acids inside an egg. For identification of monosaccharide in the gum, GC-MS (hexamethyldisilazan, trimethylchlorsilan, and pyridine) is the suitable method. GC-MS determines the same composition of dammar resin as stated in the cited sources. The simple process for the samples' treatment was designed...|$|E
5000|$|An alkyd is a {{polyester}} {{modified by}} the addition of fatty acids and other components. They are derived from polyols and a dicarboxylic acid or carboxylic acid anhydride. The term alkyd is a modification of the original name [...] "alcid", reflecting {{the fact that they are}} derived from alcohol and organic acids. The inclusion of the fatty acid confers a tendency to form flexible coating. Alkyds are used in paints and in moulds for casting. They are the dominant resin or [...] "binder" [...] in most commercial [...] "oil-based" [...] coatings. Approximately 200,000 tons of alkyd resins are produced each year. The original alkyds were compounds of glycerol and phthalic acid sold under the name Glyptal. These were sold as substitutes for the darker colored <b>Copal</b> <b>resins,</b> thus creating alkyd varnishes which were much paler in colour. From these, the alkyds we know today were developed.|$|R

50|$|Resins {{that are}} used in {{varnishes}} include amber, kauri gum, dammar, <b>copal,</b> rosin (pine <b>resin),</b> sandarac, balsam, elemi, mastic, and others. Shellac is also a resin. In the 1900s in Canada, resins from local trees were used to finish pianos. As a result, these now antique pianos are considered difficult to refinish. However, shellac can be used over the existing resins provided sufficient time is allowed for thin coats to cure. Thus the original finish can be returned to its original lustre while preserving the color and age-related crackle.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, {{especially}} in the Late Medieval and Renaissance era, sandarac was used to make varnish. When [...] "varnish" [...] was spoken of in Renaissance Italy (Italian vernice) it usually meant sandarac. <b>Copal</b> and other <b>resins</b> displaced it as equally good, less expensive varnishing materials. Nevertheless the sandarac varnish is still valued today {{for use as a}} protective coating on paintings and antiques. It gives a coat which is hard, lustrous and durable. The varnish is made by melting the resin and mixing it with (e.g.) linseed oil. Sandarac resin melts at about 150°C. to a colourless or slightly yellow liquid. Its specific gravity is about 1.04.|$|R
5000|$|Gum copal, {{also known}} as manila <b>copal,</b> is a <b>resin</b> {{produced}} by the sap of the forest tree (Daniellia sp.), due to common impurities and differences in regions, gum copal ranges in colors from blacks to yellows to whites. Gum copal, along with ivory and slaves, was a significant export from East Africa in the nineteenth century. Gum copal exists in a state {{very similar to that}} of amber but with some primary differences. It is commonly mistaken for amber and oftentimes sold at gem shows or other areas as amber. Unlike amber, gum copal is usually only 100-1,000 years old and it has not yet fossilized. [...] Gum copal usually sells for $750-$1500 USD per metric ton in rock form and $1500-$6500 USD Per metric ton in powder form.|$|R
40|$|Dominican amber is an {{important}} source for Early Miocene bryophytes. We report the moss Macromitrium richardii Schwagr., an extant representative of the Orthotrichaceae, from the Dominican amber collection of the American Museum of Natural History. This species is currently a widespread Neotropical epiphyte. The specimen includes several gametophytes and sporophytes, and represents the first fossil record of Orthotrichaceae. Alongside the Macromitrium shoots we observed several fragments of the liverworts Cheilolejeunea antiqua and Frullania sp. The unusual thermal behavior of the resin sample initially led to doubts about the Miocene age of the specimen, but chemical analyses of the Hymenaea resin provides evidence that the specimen represents a highly oxidized sample of Miocene Dominican amber rather than an artificially thermally-treated subfossil <b>resin</b> (<b>copal).</b> Our inclusion demonstrates the exceptional preservation potential of tree resin, but our observations also suggest that provenance (including any possibility that a modern resin has been thermally treated {{to make it appear}} older) should be scrutinized when single pieces with atypical thermal behavior and exceptionally well-preserved extant morphotypes come to light...|$|R
50|$|An {{offering}} to a folk saint might include the same votive candles and ex-votos (tributes of thanks) {{left at the}} shrines to canonized saints, but they also frequently include other items that reflect something of the spirit's former life or personality. Thus, Difunta Correa, who died of thirst, is given bottles of water; Maximón {{and the spirit of}} Pancho Villa are both offered cigarettes and alcohol; teddy bears and toys are left at the tomb of a little boy called Carlitos in a cemetery in Hermosillo, Mexico. Likewise, prayers to folk saints are often paired with or incorporate aspects of the Rosary but (as with many canonized saints) special petitions have been composed for many of them, each prayer evoking the particular characteristics of the saint being addressed. Other local or regional idiosyncrasies also creep in. In parts of Mexico and Central America, for example, the aromatic <b>resin</b> <b>copal</b> is burned for the more syncretic spirits like Maximón, a practice that {{has its roots in the}} offerings made to indigenous deities.|$|R
40|$|Since pre-Hispanic times, <b>copal</b> (Bursera bipinnata <b>resin)</b> {{has been}} used for {{different}} purposes, from medical to ritual or religious, which promoted its transportation from what is now the state of Guerrero to Morelos, Puebla, and Mexico City, as has been verified by ethnographic studies. During the Late Post-classic period, the resin was transported to Tenochtitlan where it was transformed into different objects such as bars, spheres, conglomerates, bases of sacrificial knives, anthropomorphic figurines and diverse amorphous fragments. The macroscopic and microscopic study of more than 300 copal objects from the offerings of the Great Temple archaeological zone (Templo Mayor) permitted the establishment of a methodology in the manufacturing processes of several formal groups, which were then corroborated by Computerized Axial Tomography, more commonly known by its abbreviated names, CT scan or CAT scan. This radiological tech-nique, created for the study of living human organisms, is very effective in archaeological applications, since it is not invasive but still allows observation of the surface of an object as well as its interior by means of virtual slices. Additionally, it allows the detection of different densities of the components of the object, making it possible to know the composition of different materials...|$|R
40|$|A {{new species}} of paedogenetic gall midge, Neostenoptera appalachiensis sp. nov., (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae: Winnertziinae: Heteropezini) from the eastern United States is {{described}} and illustrated, and pertinent collection and biological data are also provided. It is compared to its congeners, N. kiefferi (Meunier), a subfossil described from African copal, and N. congoensis Gagné, from the Congo. This rare, exciting discovery is the first record of the genus Neostenoptera in the New World. While conducting research in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) (North Carolina and Tennessee, USA) (Ferro et al. 2012), MLF collected numerous unidentifi able fl ies as bycatch from an emergence chamber used to collect beetles (Coleoptera) from dead wood. A specimen was photographed and placed on Bugguide. net under the title “Mystery Fly” (Fig. 1) (bugguide. net/node/view/ 786101 /). Several years later, JDP noticed the image and thought it bore a resemblance to the paedogenetic Neostenoptera Meunier (1902) in the subfamily Winnertziinae (Gagné and Jaschhof 2014). Neostenoptera (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae: Winnertziinae: Heteropezini) is otherwise known from two African species, N. kiefferi (Meunier, 1901) described from African <b>copal,</b> a subfossil <b>resin</b> (Grimaldi 1996), and N. congoensis Gagné (1979) described from specimens collected in a Malaise trap in the People’s Republic of the Congo. This new species represents the fi rst record of this unusual genus in North America. Upon contacting Raymond J. Gagné, Systematic Entomology Laboratory, USDA, Washington, DC about our discovery, he notifi ed us that the USNM collection had some additional specimens of Neostenoptera from the southeastern United States that we might like to study. We found these {{to be the same}} species as the specimens from GSMNP. The specimens loaned to us from the USNM were invaluable as they enabled us to see certain characters obscured in our original slide preparations...|$|R
40|$|The Heiligkreuz-Santa Croce Formation (also {{known as}} Du¨ rrenstein Formation, Upper Triassic) in the Dolomites {{contains}} {{one of the}} most ancient and substantial Triassic amber deposits in the world. The amber is found in sandstones and paleosols. It has an affinity to the conifer family Cheirolepidiaceae, and amber samples fromthe Julian and Carnic Alps (Southern Alps) also show an affinity to this family. Physico-chemical investigations of the amber from the Dolomites by solid-state Fourier-transform infrared analysis (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), pyrolysis-gaschromatography / mass-spectrometry (pyr-GC/MS), thermogravimetry (TG), differential thermogravimetry (DTG), and automatized elemental analysis yielded a complete characterization of the amber, and allowed comparison with other ambers and younger <b>resins</b> (<b>copals).</b> FTIR revealed absorption bands typical of all fossil resins, and the spectrum region from 8 – 10 mmprovided a fingerprint of the Triassic amber that differs from other known resins. The NMR spectrum also shows a typical pattern for fossil resins, but peculiar peak abundances permitted further characterization of the Triassic amber, both in the saturated (10 – 70 ppm) and unsaturated carbon region (100 – 160 ppm). The amber also lacks exomethylene resonances found in younger resins at 110 and 150 ppm. Pyrolysis-gas-chromatography / mass-spectrometry (pyr-GC/MS) experiments showed the amber was of class II, with some components of Class I. Thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermogravimetric (DTG) analyses of combustion behavior of Triassic amber indicated a main exothermal event near 4378 C, higher than that of other known resins. The elemental composition of Triassic amber is consistent with wellknown constituents of natural resins, although the sulfur content was higher, likely due to high sulfur content in the embedding sediment. Triassic amber from the Dolomites appears to be a new kind of fossil resin with unique stratigraphical and physico-chemical characteristics...|$|R
