25|$|Leakage is {{equivalent}} to a resistor in parallel with the capacitor. Constant exposure to heat can cause dielectric breakdown and excessive leakage, a problem often seen in older vacuum tube circuits, particularly where oiled paper and foil capacitors were used. In many vacuum tube circuits, interstage coupling capacitors are used to conduct a varying signal from the plate of one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage. A leaky capacitor can cause the grid circuit voltage to be raised from its normal bias setting, causing excessive current or signal distortion in the downstream tube. In power amplifiers this can cause the plates to glow red, or <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>resistors</b> to overheat, even fail.

This enhanced definition of breakdown {{is based on the}} average rate of change of the leakage current with increasing voltage, rather than a simple current threshold, avoiding ambiguous association with anomalies in current traces. For tests that continuously monitor leakage current, breakdown can be detected by a transition from negligible current to an ohmic slope defined by the circuit’s <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>resistors.</b> In practice, a fixed current threshold is inadequate to define dielectric breakdown.

The measured voltage {{on the upper}} plot shows gradual decrease, {{which is due to}} the change of the capacitance between the pad and the ITO.

In addition, in contrast to the previous work [11], there was no residual output in the estimated value after the haptic voltage turned off.

Typical boost converters, such as these, have a reference voltage of 1. 2 V. Since {{this is a}} current sourcing application, the more straightforward approach of directly sensing the boost converter’s reference voltage (Vref), which is 1. 2 V, across a sense resistor would dissipate too much power at the currents required to drive high−power White LED’s. Also, the lot−to−lot forward voltage variation is too high to simply regulate at a fixed voltage with a <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>resistor.</b> Therefore, this paper describes a technique that reduces both the power loss in the sense resistor and the lot−to−lot variation effect of the LED.

40|$|At {{high enough}} {{electrostatic}} fields or after long exposure times, insulators can break down, causing large current {{flow through the}} material: this breakdown is called electrostatic discharge (ESD). ESD is a permanent, catastrophic failure of a dielectric material: what was an insulator is now essentially a conductor. Previous tests done by the USU Materials Physics Group (MPG) using our ESD custom vacuum chamber have found that, for the polymeric materials biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP), polyimide (PI), and low density polyethylene (LDPE), the electrostatic field strength at breakdown depends on the ramp rate of voltage applied across some materials, but possibly not others. We present more extensive ramp rate data for rates from the standard 500 V/s to two orders of magnitude slower, which are more representative of actual spacecraft charging scenarios. The voltage was incrementally increased at a constant rate across the samples until breakdown occurred.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{considerations}} in designing intrinsically safe electronics devices: reducing or eliminating internal sparking, controlling component temperatures, and eliminating component spacing {{that would allow}} dust to short a circuit. Elimination of spark potential within components is accomplished by limiting the available energy in any given circuit and {{the system as a}} whole.

However at the higher luminosities projected for the HL-LHC, operation of the FCal may be compromised. Beam heating in the FCal could lead to the formation of argon bubbles in the detector, the ionization rate will result in space charge effects that will reduce the signal and the current draw will result in a voltage drop across the HV <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>resistors.</b> Two possible solutions are being considered to maintain FCal operation at HL-LHC. One is a complete replacement of the FCal system. A replacement FCal would have a similar design to the current calorimeter except for the addition of cooling loops, lower value HV protection resistors and the use of smaller ionization gaps, as small as 100 microns in the first compartment. The second solution is the installation of a small warm calorimeter, referred to as the Mini-FCal, to be placed in front of the FCal.

In the transmit mode, TX B+ {{is applied to the}} circuit to bias the diodes “on”. The shunt diode (CR 161) shorts out the receiver port, and the pi network, which oper-ates as a quarter wave transmission line, transforms the low impedance of the shunt diode to a high imped-ance at the input of the harmonic filter. In the receive mode, the diodes are both off, and hence, there exists a low attenuation path between the antenna and receiver ports. The harmonic filter consists of part of C 122, L 121, and C 123. This filter attenuates the harmonic of the module to a level better than- 55 dBc. To optimize the transmitter and receiver performance into the antenna, a network is used to match the antenna’s impedance to the harmonic filter. The net-work is made up of C 125 and L 122. The power control circuit consists of the networks associated with U 151, Q 151, Q 155, and U 111. U 111 is a directional coupler which detects the forward power of the power module U 101. The couple has 21 dB 1 dB coupling at port 2. The RF voltage at the cou-pler port 2 is rectified by CR 111, C 111, R 114, C 112, and is applied to U 151 A. This signal is amplified by U 151 A and applied to summing and integrator amplifier U 151 B. The voltage at the second input of the summing amp is supplied by DAC U 400 -P 9. This DAC is controlled by the microprocessor and provides the reference voltage for the control loop. The error voltage at the input of U 151 B- 13 produces a voltage at its output which is in turn applied to the drivers Q 151, Q 152.

A replacement FCal would have a similar design to the current calorimeter except for additional cooling, lower value HV protection resistors and the use of smaller ionization gaps; as small as 100 microns in the first compartment. There {{have been a number of}} recent studies of the effectiveness of small gap FCal style detectors for high luminosity environments. The drawback to the complete replacement of the FCal is the mechanical difficulty of extracting the current detector from its cryostat, relocating the highly radioactive detector and installing a new detector in a limited time window. These concerns led to the development of a second option which is the installation of a small warm calorimeter to be placed in front of the FCal which has been named the Mini-FCal. This addition would reduce the ionization load in the first FCal compartment at small radius by up to a factor of three, which would keep a larger region of the FCal active and reduce the heat load to an acceptable level. The current concept for the Mini-FCal is a standard parallel plate calorimeter with 12 copper disc absorbers and 11 layers of sensors. The key to the design of the Mini-FCal is the selection of a sensor technology that will produce an adequate signal for a significant number of years at HL-LHC intensities. The first choice for this is the use of diamond detectors due to their inherent radiation resistance.
