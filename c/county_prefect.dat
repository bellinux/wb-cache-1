5|$|The {{number of}} members of the councils is defined by the councils themselves, based on {{applicable}} legislation. Electoral committees are then tasked with determining whether the national ethnic minorities are represented on the council as required by the constitution. Further members who belong to the minorities may be added to the council in no candidate of that minority has been elected through the proportional representation system. Election silence, as in all other types of elections in Croatia, when campaigning is forbidden, is enforced the day before the election and continues until 19:00 hours on the election day when the polling stations close and exit polls may be announced. Six nationwide local elections have been held in Croatia since 1990, the most recent being the 2009 local elections to elect county prefects and councils, and city and municipal councils and mayors. In 2009, the HDZ-led coalitions won a majority or plurality in fifteen county councils and thirteen <b>county</b> <b>prefect</b> elections. SDP-led coalitions won a majority or plurality in five county councils, including the city of Zagreb council, and the remaining county council election was won by IDS-SDP coalition. The SDP won four <b>county</b> <b>prefect</b> elections and the city of Zagreb mayoral election, the HSS won three <b>county</b> <b>prefect</b> elections, and the HNS and the HDSSB won a single <b>county</b> <b>prefect</b> election each.|$|E
5|$|The same {{procedure}} applies to local elections, except that council-election lists require 100, 150 and 500 endorsements for town, city and county-council lists respectively. The city of Zagreb council {{is treated as}} a county council under election law. The number of voter signatures on mayoral and <b>county</b> <b>prefect</b> candidate nominations ranges between 50 (for mayoral elections in towns of up to 1,000 residents), 100 (for other town mayoral candidates), 500 (for mayoral elections in cities of up to 35,000 residents), 1,000 (in cities with populations between 35,000 and 100,000) and 2,000 endorsements for cities of 100,000 residents or more (with the exception of Zagreb). <b>County</b> <b>prefect</b> election candidates require 2,500 endorsements, and candidates running for mayor of Zagreb need 5,000 voter endorsements for their nominations to become valid.|$|E
5|$|With these reforms, kings {{were reduced}} to being nominal heads of their fiefs, gaining a {{personal}} income from {{only a portion of}} the taxes collected in their kingdom. Similarly, the officials in the administrative staff of a full marquess's fief were appointed by the central government. A marquess's Chancellor was ranked as the equivalent of a <b>county</b> <b>Prefect.</b> Like a king, the marquess collected a portion of the tax revenues in his fief as personal income.|$|E
50|$|The {{elections}} {{were held to}} elect members of city councils, mayors, members of county councils and <b>county</b> <b>prefects.</b> These were the first elections in which mayors and <b>county</b> <b>prefects</b> were elected directly by popular vote, rather than by a majority coalition in the council. The new system allowed many independent politicians to run against big party nominees. Many cities elected independent mayors, most notable being Split, Croatia's second largest city and Kaštela. As a result many cities and counties elected opposite lists for mayoral and council elections causing a larger amount of cohabitation local governments.|$|R

5|$|Han society {{below the}} level of kings was divided into twenty ranks, which awarded certain {{privileges}} such as exemption from certain laws, the nineteenth being a marquess and the twentieth being a full marquess—the difference being the former was only given a pension while the latter was given a marquessate (houguo 侯國)—typically the size of a county. If the kings' sons were grandsons of the emperor, they were made full marquesses; if not, they were considered commoners. However, this rule was changed in 127 BC so that all the kings' sons were made full marquesses. It is unknown whether early Western-Han marquessates enjoyed the same level of autonomy as early Western-Han kingdoms; by 145 BC, all marquessates' staff were appointed by the central government. The marquess had no administrative role over his marquessate; he merely collected a portion of the tax revenues. His Chancellor was the equivalent of a <b>county</b> <b>Prefect.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1866, Domnitor Cuza was {{replaced}} with Carol of Hohenzollern. Apparently, Pantazi Ghica had played a secondary part in the conspiracy that toppled Cuza, as a local commander of the Citizens' Guard. Ghica was subsequently assigned the office of Buzău <b>County</b> <b>prefect</b> by {{the first of his}} brother's cabinets. The appointment was welcomed by Vasile Alecsandri, who was keeping a detailed correspondence with both brothers. However, his time in office was cut short, allegedly because he came to be disliked by Carol. He returned to the capital, where he purchased a villa on Cometei Street (the present-day Căderea Bastiliei Street), nearby Piaţa Romană. For a second time in eight years, he was exposed to public scrutiny for having failed to honor his debts: in 1868, his possessions in Buzău were sequestrated. Late in the year, he was Alecsandri's representative during a legal conflict with the peasants residing on his domain (after winning the trial, Alecsandri reciprocated by introducing Ghica to his friend, Minister of the Interior Mihail Kogălniceanu).|$|E
25|$|In {{parallel}} to his writing, Theodorian advanced through with his bureau jobs, working as second inspector for State Monopolies in 1896, and being assigned a clerical position at Bucharest Police Headquarters in 1897. In April 1898, while commanding the police unit in Gara de Nord, he apprehended {{a ring of}} mail thieves who had thrived on transited Western merchandise. Later that year, he became head of police in Râmnicu Vâlcea, mediating between his politically ambitious brother and the Vâlcea <b>County</b> <b>prefect</b> (1900). He married Ana Iancovescu in 1899, and had two daughters from her—Emma and Alice. From 1901 to 1903, he was a deputy prefect in Northern Dobruja, moving between Babadag, Sulina, Cataloi and Măcin. He was again in Vâlcea as a village inspector on the Lotru (1904), putting out the magazine Râmnicul (1906). Following the peasants' revolt of March 1907 and the cession of power to a National Liberal cabinet, he became for a while director of the Vâlcea prefecture. During this interval, he played host to an informal gathering of writers, including Victor Eftimiu, Octavian Goga, and Ilarie Chendi. According to Eftimiu, {{it was here that}} Chendi showed the first signs of a debilitating mental disease.|$|E
