30|$|A {{differential}} two-wheeled robot is {{a mobile}} robot whose movement {{is based on}} two separately driven wheels placed {{on either side of}} the robot body. It can thus change its direction by varying the relative rate of rotation of its wheels and hence does not require an additional steering motion. One or more free wheels (or ‘castor’ wheels) assure the robot equilibrium. Each <b>castor</b> <b>wheel</b> is independently mounted on a vertical non-drive axis of the body and it is automatically and freely aligned on the route as a result of the forces developed by the two ‘drive wheels’. If both wheels are driven in the same direction and at the same speed, the robot will go in a straight line. Otherwise, depending on the speed of rotation and its direction, the centre of rotation may fall anywhere in the line that joins the two wheels. Since the direction of the robot is dependent on the rate and direction of rotation of the two driven wheels, these quantities should be sensed and controlled precisely. This usually creates some problem. If both wheels are turned with equal speed in opposite directions, the robot will rotate about the central point of the axis.|$|E
40|$|Wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) {{have been}} widely used for {{navigation}} purposes as well as industrial applications such as path tracking and obstacle detections. Differential drive robot (DDR) is one type of WMRs with a specific wheel configuration where two fixed wheels are controlled by the motors and a <b>castor</b> <b>wheel</b> is added to mechanically support its translational and rotational movements. For tracking purposes, the controller plays a very important role to ensure it does not deviate far from the targeted locations or path. In this project, a DDR is built with two DC motors. As most motors exhibit nonlinear behavior, they are modeled as a multivariable Hammerstein-Wiener structure which contains static nonlinearities and a linear system in series with each other. The identification of the linear model is performed via time response analysis with different types of inputs, whereas the nonlinearities are estimated via several tests in MATLAB Simulink. This work also focuses on both dynamic and kinematic models of the DDR where a proportional-integral (PI) controller is designed to achieve the desired specifications in the linear region. In order to account for the nonlinear effects from the DC motor model which is mainly influenced by its bounded velocity capability, a static anti-windup compensator (AWC) is implemented which is activated when the controller output exceeds the bound. Via this strategy, a significant improvement on the tracking performance of the DDR can be observed via simulations especially when the desired path involves sharp corners or turns. ...|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. Electrical Engineering. Wheeled Mobile Platforms have {{considerable}} acceptance and {{dominance in the}} field of transportation. While most of these platforms have been designed for able users, very few special designs are available for the physically disabled persons. With increasing numbers of disabled peoples around the world, accommodative and safer displacement means are called for. A normal wheelchair platform with two front <b>castor</b> <b>wheel</b> and two independently driven rear wheels is therefore considered in this study for modelling and control. Based on the nature of persons using wheelchairs, better and much easy to control wheelchair platforms are necessitated. To achieve such objective, this research is focused on two main threads: dynamic modelling and control. In modelling, the aim is to present a dynamic model of wheelchair platform that takes into account slipping parameters and frictional/traction forces experienced on motion. It also intends to account for the effects of gravitational forces that would be experienced by the wheelchair and its effect on the platforms during uphill and downhill movements. Lagrange formalism is utilised in the design of this dynamic model. In control, the objective is to ensure that the platform tracks the reference linear velocity and the reference angular orientation as desired. With such control commands, a simple access device may be employed to ensure that people with severe disability also have a chance of controlling the wheelchair. Since no zero dynamics arise with linear velocity and angular orientation as the platforms outputs, standard input-output feedback linearisation is considered and applied in the linearisation of the model and {{in the development of the}} control law. Successfully simulated results demonstrating the performance of the proposed dynamic model and control law are presented for verification. The entire dynamic model and the controller are simulated in a software tool MATLAB and SIMULINK...|$|E

40|$|A self-navigating, path {{following}} and obstacle avoiding mobile robot {{is difficult to}} realize especially when its sensors are strongly effected by noise. This MSc thesis is aimed at investigating a realistic scenario of an autonomous mobile robot simulated in the MatLab environment. The robot system is able to follow a given reference path by utilizing its onboard sensors and decision making capabilities to avoid collisions with arbitrarily placed obstacles along its path. A novel navigational algorithm based on modifying the robot’s way-points using the run-time sensory data is developed and used to go around obstacles and then rejoin the original travel path as needed. The thesis work explores the impact of varying noise in the sensory data and ways of improving the navigational accuracy via signal processing. The study is done in two major sections, the first focusing on the navigational aspects of the mobile robot and the second exploring the sensory data analyses issues. The robot considered has a triangular shape with two differentially driven wheels at the rear left and rear right corners for skid steering control and one <b>castor</b> <b>wheel</b> in the front corner for balance purposes. The sensing system of the mobile robot includes infrared range finders with viewing angles of 180 degrees placed on {{the corners of the}} robot, which are able to detect obstacles all around the robot allowing effective path planning to be carried out via the special-purpose developed navigational algorithms. A reference path in an obstacle cluttered environment is assumed to be available for the robot to follow while avoiding randomly placed obstacles as the two wheels are driven to navigate the robot along the path using the robot kinematics. For making the navigation mobility of the robot as realistic as possible, practical infrared sensors have been studied experimentally to determine their noise characteristics to include in the simulation studies and the noise levels easily varied to simulate low and high noise levels and assess their effects on the overall navigational precision. Signal processing methods are used to show that improvements in the navigational performance can be achieved when the noise levels are high...|$|E
40|$|Currently, wheelchairs in {{developing}} countries are supplied both through donations from NGOs and local wheelchair workshops in these countries. A popular type of wheelchair manufactured by these workshops is a three-wheeled wheelchair, which has a long wheel base and third <b>castor</b> <b>wheel</b> {{in front of the}} chair. These wheelchairs perform better in the rough terrain of the developing world, but do not have a folding frame, and thus cannot be transported. This severely diminishes the ability of the wheelchair's user to travel far distances and generate income. Because of this problem, this project aims at developing a frame for the three-wheeled wheelchair that folds into small dimensions similar to a traditional four-wheeled wheelchair. (cont.) The major considerations when designing this wheelchair were weight, cost, and local availability of materials. All materials used for the wheelchair {{can be found in the}} majority of developing countries, as they consist of mild steel, bicycle parts, ABS plastic, and canvas for the seat. After evaluation of designs, a double L-brace, which very closely resembles the x-braces used in traditional four-wheeled wheelchairs, was decided upon. Being similar to these wheelchairs will increase user acceptance of this wheelchair. Analysis optimized the dimensions of the L-brace, and found all forces and moments on the wheelchair, so that the size of mild steel piping could be minimized, thus reducing both the weight and cost. The maximum moment in the center rod of the wheelchair was found to be 236. 0 Nm and in the L-brace the maximum moment was 315. 9 Nm. With the application of a safety factor, these values lead to the selection of mild steel piping with a diameter of 48. 25 mm and a thickness of 1. 5 mm for the center rod and a diameter of 60 mm and a thickness of 1. 2 mm for the rest of the frame. Using these materials give a final material cost of $ 89. 01, significantly less than the current cost of $ 230. The final weight is estimated to be 55. 1 pounds, which is much higher than the current weight of only 45 pounds. This will be an important feature to look at in future work, and hopefully this new design can be reduced to about 45 pounds. by Amanda Joy Maguire. Thesis (S. B.)

30|$|A growing {{issue in}} the paralympic {{movement}} {{is the impact of}} equipment on performance. In this systematic review, equipment was defined as a covariate in relation to the study goal. Athletes are competitive by nature and will try to enhance their performance as well as limit the impact of impairment on performance by using optimised equipment. This use of equipment is sport specific and often based on experience. However, the equipment permitted in wheelchair court sports shows similarities across sports [12 - 14]. Studies in this review explored the use of belts and straps, wheelchair set up, seating configuration and functional electrical stimulation (FES). Two studies assessed the possible influence of equipment in relation to trunk impairment [36, 38] though equipment that is not used for wheelchair court sports was tested [13, 16]. The only study that assessed equipment used in court sports found that multidirectional reach improves in athletes with SCI by the use of a thigh or trunk belt [31]. Reach {{is only one of the}} many relevant activities for wheelchair court sport, and in addition to belting, the chair set up (position of the seat and the backrest and height of the backrest) is also believed to impact on reach [16]. In one study, FES of the trunk extensor muscles was used to improve unsupported seating and to lift objects with different weights [39]. Functional electrical stimulation primarily impacts on impairment in muscle strength. The use of implanted electrodes as a piece of equipment is new to moment in the paralympic movement. So far, there is no consensus if this equipment should be allowed during sport performance and whether or not this equipment should be part of athlete evaluation in classification [43]. On the other hand, in the study exploring the effect of trunk impairment on acceleration in wheelchair racing, athletes used their own custom designed wheelchair. It must be noted that a racing wheelchair seating configuration is quite different from the configuration of a wheelchair for court sports. Opposite to wheelchairs used for court sports, the racing wheelchair does not have rear castor wheels to prevent tipping when maximum force is applied on the wheel [44]. As a consequence of the absence of the <b>castor</b> <b>wheel,</b> the racing athletes in this study may not have been able to use maximum force in accelerating, because of the risk of tipping backward. This limits the generalisation of the results of this study regarding the impact of trunk impairment on acceleration to wheelchair court sports. Additional research is necessary to examine the acceleration in a court sports wheelchair with the typical rear castor wheels to determine if trunk muscle strength does impact on acceleration when tipping of the chair is prevented.|$|E

40|$|Control of {{wheeled chassis}} does not {{constitute}} {{a problem in the}} area of mobile robotic solely. Rather, it can be encountered in transportation, both at close range and long range. In this thesis, mobile chassis are characterized as kinematic models. These models prove to be erroneous at high speed, whereas they sufficiently accurately represent the real robotic system in situations when slow, autonomous motion of the robot is desired. In comparison with dynamic models, both their project and implementation are simpler, too. The first part of this thesis is focused on a basic description of the motion of a robot in-plane. In the next part, five, most frequently used wheels in robotics are described and characterized - standard fixed wheels, standard steering <b>wheels,</b> <b>castor</b> <b>wheels,</b> multidirectional wheels and omnidirectional wheels. The motion conditions are deduced from each type of wheel. There are two methods of projecting the mobile robot model – full modelling and generic modelling. Based on these two methods, six models of mobile robots with different motion properties are proposed and described. The last and most extensive part of this thesis deals with simulator of robot motion created in Matlab/Simulink. It includes users guide which allows the configuration of random chassis and various trajectories of motion.

40|$|In this research, a new {{approach}} to develop an object pushing system with a simple mobile robot with two DC servo motor driven <b>wheels</b> and two <b>castor</b> <b>wheels</b> are introduced. This is an attempt to design and develop a system with less number of sensors to detect the reaction force generated on the mobile robot while pushing an object. The robot behavior is such that it always tends to push the object towards the center of the pusher attached to the robot. This is achieved by rotating one driving wheel of the robot by a fixed amount of rotation. This rotation is such that the motor torque is increased continuously by increasing the motor driving positive pulse width of the pulse width modulated signal from its neutral position until the required amount or rotation is obtained. At this moment the motor stops and the wheel attached to the other motor follows the same operation. This motion creates a zigzag movement on the pushing plate attached in front of the robot. This zigzag motion always moves the object towards the centre of the pusher. When the object comes close to the centre of the pusher the force applied from both motors becomes equal. Detection of this force is done by using the positive pulse width of the motor and the encoder pulses generated by the optical encoder attached to both wheels of the robot. The test results are given to support the proposed approach...|$|R
