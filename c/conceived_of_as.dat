40|$|Abstract: Framing {{prostitution}} as {{an economic}} exchange, this paper evaluates some of the consequences <b>of</b> <b>conceiving</b> <b>of</b> sex <b>as</b> a commodity rather than <b>as</b> an aspect <b>of</b> an intimate interpersonal relationship among the customers of prostitutes. Subjects were 700 men arrested while trying to hire street prostitutes. Questionnaires were administered prior to intervention programs designed to discourage re-offense in San Francisco, California (N= 588); Portland, Oregon (N= 82); and Las Vegas, Nevada (N= 30). Significant predictors <b>of</b> <b>conceiving</b> <b>of</b> sex <b>as</b> a commodity included being unmarried, having served in the military, and more frequent visits to prostitutes. <b>Conceiving</b> <b>of</b> sex <b>as</b> a commodity significantly predicted rape myth acceptance, attraction to violent sexuality, less frequent use of condoms while with prostitutes, support for prostitution, and the attitude that prostitution is positive for women. We argue that that <b>conceiving</b> <b>of</b> sex <b>as</b> a commodity {{has a number of}} negative implications for the men involved, their sexual partners, and for gender relations in general...|$|R
5|$|Jains {{believe that}} karma is a {{physical}} substance that is everywhere in the universe. Karma particles are attracted to the soul {{by the actions of}} that soul. Karma particles are attracted when we do, think, or say things, when we kill something, when we lie, when we steal and so on. Karma not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also <b>conceived</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā). Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.|$|E
5|$|Market Forces was {{science fiction}} author Richard K. Morgan's third novel. His first two novels, Altered Carbon (2002) and Broken Angels (2003), {{were the first}} two parts of a trilogy later {{completed}} with Woken Furies (2005). That Takeshi Kovacs trilogy, hardboiled detective fiction set in the 25th century, gave Morgan a reputation for writing excellent action sequences along with a Philip K. Dick Award. Before the third part of the trilogy was published, Morgan worked on his idea for Market Forces, which he <b>conceived</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> a short story, then developed as a film script, then as a novel. At the time, Morgan was 38 years old living in Glasgow, Scotland. He has sold the filming rights to Altered Carbon to Warner Bros. (he would also sell the rights to Market Forces to Warner Bros.) allowing him to leave his job as an English teacher at the University of Strathclyde to focus on his writing career.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps each source has {{preserved}} {{a part of}} {{the same}} truth and Sessrúmnir was <b>conceived</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> both a ship and an afterlife location in Fólkvangr. 'A ship in a field' is a somewhat unexpected idea, but it is strongly reminiscent of the stone ships in Scandinavian burial sites. 'A ship in the field' in the mythical realm may have been conceived as a reflection of actual burial customs and vice versa. It is possible that the symbolic ship was thought of as providing some sort of beneficial property to the land, such as good seasons and peace brought on by Freyr’s mound burial in Ynglinga saga.|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{research}} on transnationalism and transmigrants has contemporary examples of divergence and criticism <b>of</b> methodological nationalism <b>as</b> an enduring practice in scholarship. Recent studies in transnationalism have <b>conceived</b> <b>of</b> the nation-state <b>as</b> one agent {{in a complex}} relationship with many global actors. Migration Studies that <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> society <b>as</b> extending beyond national boundaries, then, sever this link between nation-state and society.|$|R
5|$|Using one of {{the above}} definitions, dinosaurs can be {{generally}} described as archosaurs with hind limbs held erect beneath the body. Many prehistoric animal groups are popularly <b>conceived</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> dinosaurs, such as ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and pelycosaurs (especially Dimetrodon), but are not classified scientifically as dinosaurs, and none had the erect hind limb posture characteristic of true dinosaurs. Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic, especially the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Other groups of animals were restricted in size and niches; mammals, for example, rarely exceeded {{the size of a}} domestic cat, and were generally rodent-sized carnivores of small prey.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the thirteenth century, the Bilwis is less and less {{frequently}} treated as the personification of a supernatural power but becomes increasingly identified as a malevolent human being, a witch. Still later, with the rise of the witch persecution {{at the end of the}} Middle Ages, the Bilwis was demonized; she becomes an incarnation of the devil for the witch and sorcerer. A final development has taken place since the sixteenth century, especially in northeast Germany, the Bilwis has been <b>conceived</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> a grain spirit bringing wealth; yet this latest manifestation of the Bilwis has its harmful side, the Bilwis-cutter, who is blamed for the unexplained patterns that are formed among the rows of standing grain. The cutter is a sorcerer or witch that cuts down the corn with sickles that are fastened to its feet. He is classified as an essentially malevolent Corn Spirit. Thus, the Bilwis is exceedingly polymorphous, taking on many appearances and meaning in all German-speaking areas throughout the Middle Ages. The Bilwis is one of the strangest and most mysterious beings in all folklore; its varying forms reflect the concerns of a farm culture, and it serves to explain the eerie appearance of turned-down rows of plants in cornfields.|$|E

50|$|Governmental {{policies}} often {{reflect the}} tension between two contrasting types of language ideologies: ideologies that <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> language <b>as</b> a resource, problem, or right and ideologies that <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> language <b>as</b> pluralistic phenomena. The language-related policies that emerge in such instances often reflect the compromise that is reached between {{these two types of}} ideologies. According to Blommaert and Verschueren, this compromise is often reinterpreted as a single, unified ideology, evidenced by the many European societies characterized by a language ideological homogenism.|$|R

40|$|This study explores an {{interpretation}} <b>of</b> mysticism <b>as</b> a way <b>of</b> {{life that is}} a response to what the mystic <b>conceives</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> ultimate reality. The suggestion is that what lies at the centre of reality is the sense of a dynamic non-dialectic absence/presence. Mysticism is suggested to be an exploration of this centre of reality that {{takes the form of a}} conjoined movement of transcending and integrating. The argument of the study is developed in light of the contemporary approach that has made mysticism either totally grounded in the mystic's socio-linguistic context (Steven T. Katz) or detached from it in a 'pure consciousness event' (Robert K. C. Forman et al), both of which are primarily driven by a focus on mysticism as an experience. What is judged to have been overlooked in the contemporary discussion is that which is argued as being most endemic to mysticism, that is, the explorative life-enactment of that which the mystic <b>conceives</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> ultimate reality.

25|$|In monotheistic thought, God is <b>conceived</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> the Supreme Being and the {{principal}} object of faith. The concept of God, as described by theologians, commonly includes the attributes of omniscience (all-knowing), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), divine simplicity, and as having an eternal and necessary existence. Many theologians also describe God as being omnibenevolent (perfectly good) and all loving.|$|E
25|$|The {{essence of}} deep-rooted spirit lore is that {{supposed}} spirits {{of one kind or}} another – spirits of the dead, phantasms of the living, wraiths, or nature entities like fairies move through the physical landscape along special routes. In their ideal, pristine form, at least, such routes are <b>conceived</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> being straight, having something in common with ley lines.

25|$|On the inscribed healing amulets of the Near Eastern and European magico-medical tradition, {{illness or}} affliction is often personified and {{addressed}} directly; the practitioner may be instructed to inscribe or chant {{a phrase that}} orders the ailment to depart: for example, “Flee, Fever!” The ailment may also be <b>conceived</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> caused by a demon, who must be identified correctly by name and commanded to depart.

25|$|Sometimes {{there is}} a kind of {{redundancy}} whereby the referent of the whole kenning, or a kenning for it, is embedded: barmi dólg-svölu “brother of hostility-swallow” = “brother of raven” = “raven” (Oddr breiðfirðingr: Illugadrápa 1); blik-meiðendr bauga láðs “gleam-harmers of the land of rings” = “harmers of gleam of arm” = “harmers of ring” = “leaders, nobles, men of social standing (<b>conceived</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> generously destroying gold, i.e. giving it away freely)” (Anon.: Líknarbraut 42).|$|E
