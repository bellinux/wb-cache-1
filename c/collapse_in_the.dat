5|$|Though oil has {{historically}} dominated the state's economy, a <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> energy industry during the 1980s {{led to the}} loss of nearly 90,000 energy-related jobs between 1980 and 2000, severely damaging the local economy. Oil accounted for 35 billion dollars in Oklahoma's economy in 2007, and employment in the state's oil industry was outpaced by five other industries in 2007. , the state's unemployment rate is 4.4%.|$|E
5|$|Tibet {{was once}} a strong power {{contemporaneous}} with Tang China (618–907). Until the Tibetan Empire's <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 9th century, it was the Tang's major rival in dominating Inner Asia. The Yarlung rulers of Tibet also signed various peace treaties with the Tang, culminating in a treaty in 821 that fixed the borders between Tibet and China.|$|E
5|$|By November 1998, UBS's {{losses from}} its {{exposure}} to LTCM were estimated {{at the level}} of approximately CHF 790million. UBS would prove to be the largest single loser in the LTCM collapse, ultimately writing off CHF 950million. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a bailout of US$3.625billion by the hedge fund's major creditors to avoid a wider <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> financial markets. UBS contributed US$300million to the bailout effort, which would largely be recovered. In the aftermath of the LTCM collapse, Mathis Cabiallavetta resigned as chairman of UBS, along with three other executives.|$|E

5|$|Engineering {{requirements}} {{resulted in}} significant {{changes to the}} specification of the XJ220, most notably replacement of the Jaguar V12 engine by a turbocharged V6 engine. The changes to the specification and a <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> price of collectible cars {{brought about by the}} early 1990s recession resulted in many buyers choosing not to exercise their purchase options. A total of just 275 cars were produced by the time production ended, each with a retail price of £470,000 in 1992 making it their most expensive car during its debut.|$|E
5|$|In Hong Kong, Krovanh's outer rainbands brought squally weather, {{coupled with}} strong winds. Rainfall in the Hong Kong area peaked at 232mm (9.13in) on High Island, Hong Kong, {{much of which}} {{occurred}} on August25. Other rainfall totals of at least 70mm (2.75in) were measured over {{a majority of the}} country. Gusts peaked at 144km/h (89mph) on Cheung Chau. The strong winds and gusts uprooted trees and caused scaffolding at an estate to <b>collapse.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> province, 11people were injured due to effects from Krovanh. A ferry service and four bus routes were temporarily suspended following the storm.|$|E
5|$|On 5 July 2015, the {{citizens}} of Greece voted decisively (a 61% to 39% decision with 62.5% voter turnout) to reject a referendum {{that would have given}} Greece more bailout help from other EU members in return for increased austerity measures. As a result of this vote, Greece's finance minister Yanis Varoufakis stepped down on 6 July. Negotiations between Greece and other Eurozone members will continue in the following days to procure funds from the European Central Bank in order to prevent an economic <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country.|$|E

5|$|Pattle claimed four {{victories}} during five sorties on 14 April. One Bf 109, one Ju 88 and a Bf 110 were {{claimed as}} destroyed. His final victory was an Italian SM.79 in the afternoon. The day took his tally to 40 enemy aircraft. As {{the wreckage of}} some old Greek aircraft and a captured SM.79 was being cleared up after the attack on 13 April, John D'Albiac, Air Officer Commanding British Forces in Greece, arrived to warn him of the Allied <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north. After seeing the AOC off in a Lysander aircraft escorted by five squadron Hurricanes, Pattle evacuated his squadron to Eleusis.|$|E
5|$|There {{was another}} {{pollution}} incident in March 2008 when twenty {{miles of the}} river turned orange. Iron oxide from old mine workings near the source at Irwell Springs had polluted the water since 1969 and in 1997 a Coal Authority survey identified the stretch as having the fourth worst case of minewater pollution in the country. A treatment plant was built in 1999 to remove the pollution {{at a cost of}} £1M; however, it is thought that there was a <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mine after heavy rains in the spring of 2008. Although the water was stained with ochre, no damage to wildlife was reported.|$|E

5|$|Advancements {{in weapons}} {{technology}} enhanced by gunpowder, including {{the evolution of}} the early flamethrower, explosive grenade, firearm, cannon, and land mine, enabled the Song Chinese to ward off their militant enemies until the Song's ultimate <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 13th century. The Wujing Zongyao manuscript of 1044 was the first book in history to provide formulas for gunpowder and their specified use in different types of bombs. While engaged in a war with the Mongols, in 1259 the official Li Zengbo wrote in his Kezhai Zagao, Xugaohou that the city of Qingzhou was manufacturing one to two thousand strong iron-cased bomb shells a month, dispatching to Xiangyang and Yingzhou about ten to twenty thousand such bombs at a time. In turn, the invading Mongols employed northern Chinese soldiers and used these same types of gunpowder weapons against the Song. By the 14th century the firearm and cannon could also be found in Europe, India, and the Islamic Middle East, during the early age of gunpowder warfare.|$|E
5|$|After the referendum, Lukashenko {{convened a}} new {{parliamentary}} assembly from those {{members of the}} parliament who were loyal to him. After between ten and twelve deputies withdrew their signature from the impeachment petition, only about forty deputies of the old parliament were left and the Supreme Soviet was dismissed by Lukashenko. Nevertheless, international organizations and many Western countries do not recognize the current parliament given {{the way it was}} formed. At the start of 1998, the Central Bank of Russia suspended trading in the Belarusian ruble, which led to a <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> value of the currency. Lukashenko responded by taking control of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus, sacking the entire bank leadership and blaming the West for the free fall of the currency.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{came out}} to bat halfway through the middle session on the second day, after England had ended on 363. Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia with only one {{specialist}} opener, Morris. Johnson—a bowler—was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener and fell for one. On the third morning, Barnes {{came out to}} bat upon Keith Miller's dismissal at 4/135, {{even though he had}} collapsed from the aftereffects of his injury while practising in the nets. Barnes had refused to stay in hospital and returned to the ground despite his ribs being discoloured from the bruising. Bradman was not aware of Barnes's <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nets, but had told all rounder Sam Loxton to bat before Barnes to give the bruised opener more rest. Loxton told Barnes of Bradman's wishes, but when Miller was dismissed, Barnes defied team orders and walked out to bat, shaking Pollard's hand at the start of his innings.|$|E

5|$|Corzine also chaired {{a presidential}} {{commission}} on capital budgeting for Bill Clinton {{and served as}} Chairman of the U.S. Treasury Department's borrowing committee. As the Goldman Sachs senior partner, he helped develop a private sector plan to rescue the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management when the leveraged fund's <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fall of 1998 threatened contagion across the U.S. financial system. According to U.S. News & World Report, Corzine did not get along with co-CEO Henry Paulson, who came from the other major area of the bank, investment banking. When Corzine participated in structuring the bailout, Paulson seized control of the firm. As co-chairman of the firm, he oversaw its expansion into Asia. When Goldman Sachs went public after Corzine's departure, Corzine made $400million.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the gravity}} of this rebellion, the Illyrians went on, {{alongside}} their neighbours the Thracians, to become {{the backbone of the}} Roman army. By the 2nd century, with roughly half the Roman army deployed on the Danube frontier, the auxilia and legions alike were dominated by Illyrian recruits. In the 3rd century, Illyrians largely replaced Italians in the senior officer echelons of praefecti of auxiliary regiments and tribuni militum of legions. Finally, from AD 268 to 379, virtually all emperors, including Diocletian and Constantine the Great were Romanised Illyrians from the provinces of Dalmatia, Moesia Superior and Pannonia. These were members of a military aristocracy, outstanding soldiers who saved the empire from <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> turbulent late 3rd century.|$|E
5|$|Fleury {{missed the}} first two months of the season before being reinstated. While out with {{teammates}} in January 2003, he was involved in a drunken brawl with bouncers at a strip club in Columbus, Ohio, that left him bloodied; he has no memory of the night and described it as among the lowest points of his life. He was not suspended, but the incident contributed to a <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> standings by the Blackhawks, and they placed him on waivers in March. No team claimed him, and Fleury finished the season with the Blackhawks, recording 12goals and 21assists in 54games. Following the season, in April 2003, he was suspended again by the league for violations of its substance abuse program. The suspension ended his NHL career.|$|E

5|$|From a low base at the {{beginning}} of the sixteenth century, trade expanded in the 1530s, but suffered from the English invasions of the Rough Wooing in the 1540s. From the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland experienced a decline in demand for exports of cloth and wool to the continent. Scots responded by selling larger quantities of traditional goods, increasing the output of salt, herring and coal. The fortunes of Scottish burghs in the export trade changed across the century. Haddington, which had been one of the major centres of trade in the late Medieval period, saw its share of foreign exports <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sixteenth century. Aberdeen's share of trade remained stable for most of the century, but slumped in the last decade. The small Fife ports grew in significance and Edinburgh took an increasing share of trade through its port of Leith. This forced smaller ports to diversify into other commodities and to undertake more coastal trading. Overall there was an increase in foreign trade from the 1570s, of which Edinburgh received the major share.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{situation}} {{improved in}} May 1119 when he enticed Fulk to switch sides by finally agreeing to marry William Adelin to Fulk's daughter, Matilda, and paying Fulk {{a large sum}} of money. Fulk left for the Levant, leaving the County of Maine in Henry's care, and the King was free to focus on crushing his remaining enemies. During the summer Henry advanced into the Norman Vexin, where he encountered Louis's army, resulting in the Battle of Brémule. Henry appears to have deployed scouts and then organised his troops into several carefully formed lines of dismounted knights. Unlike Henry's forces, the French knights remained mounted; they hastily charged the Anglo-Norman positions, breaking through the first rank of the defences but then becoming entangled in Henry's second line of knights. Surrounded, the French army began to <b>collapse.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> melee, Henry {{was hit by a}} sword blow, but his armour protected him. Louis and William Clito escaped from the battle, leaving Henry to return to Rouen in triumph.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield became {{involved}} with Matt Cimber (a.k.a.

She married him on September 24, 1964, in Mulegé, Baja California Sur, Mexico. The couple separated on July 11, 1965, and filed for divorce on July 20, 1966. Cimber took over the management of her career during their marriage, and guided her {{through a series of}} increasingly tawdry projects like Promises, Promises and The Las Vegas Hillbillys. Mansfield's marriage to Cimber began to <b>collapse</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wake of her alcohol abuse, open infidelities, and her disclosure to Cimber that she had been happy only with her former lover, Nelson Sardelli. Work on Mansfield's film, Single Room Furnished directed by Cimber (1966), was suspended.|$|E
