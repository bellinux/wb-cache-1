The reporter then steered the sky-cycle to One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Street. There he crossed the East River again and then hovered over Greenpoint. The reporter flew the sky-cycle until almost dark and landed safely at the property of P. B. Gupther in Yonkers.

25|$|At 2330 hours Laake {{was warned}} by {{chief of the}} general staff Rasmus Hatledal that foreign {{warships}} were intruding on Norwegian territorial waters. Before Laake <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to Oslo minister of defence Ljungberg, the latter had left the general staff's offices to attend a cabinet meeting. The top officers of the Norwegian Army were gathering at the general staff in Oslo. In {{the early hours of}} 9 April 1940, Hatledal repeatedly attempted to get in contact with defence minister Ljungberg, and confusion reigned in the general staff as no orders from the politicians came. No attempts were made by the general staff at preparing for mobilization by warning the telegraph offices, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, or the newspapers. General Laake was of the opinion that it served no purpose to prepare for mobilization, as the mobilization itself would take at least three days to carry out in any case. The situation remained uncertain, with no declarations of war from Germany.|$|E

25|$|American Motors' major stockholder, Renault, {{was itself}} {{experiencing}} financial trouble in France. The investment in AMC (including {{construction of a}} new Canadian assembly plant in Brampton, Ontario) forced cuts at home, resulting in the closure of several French plants and mass layoffs. Renault was down to just three alternatives regarding its American holdings: (1) They could declare AMC officially bankrupt thereby lose its investment; (2) They could come up with more money, but Renault management perceived AMC as a bottomless pit; or (3) AMC could be put up for sale and the French <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> part of their investment. Against these detractions, Renault's chairman, Georges Besse, continued to champion the French firm's future in the North American market; pointing to the company's completion of the newest and most-advanced automotive assembly plant in North America, then known as Bramalea Assembly, as well as the recent introduction of the thoroughly modern, fuel-injected 4.0L and 2.5L engines. In addition, Jeep vehicles were riding an unprecedented surge in demand. It seemed to Besse and others that AMC was on course for profitability.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{the day at}} 80/0, Australia {{lost both}} Simon Katich and Shane Watson LBW in quick {{succession}} within the first five overs. Ponting and Hussey then built an impressive partnership, sharing a stand of 127 runs before Ponting was run out by a direct hit from Andrew Flintoff fielding at mid-off, which marked an important {{turning point in the}} match. Michael Clarke was then run out in the very next over following some sharp fielding from Andrew Strauss at slip, while Marcus North was next to go when he left his ground to reach for a Greame Swann delivery but missed, allowing keeper Matt Prior to stump him before he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>back.</b> Hussey and Haddin steadied the innings as Hussey reached his first century in 28 Test innings after earlier being dropped by Paul Collingwood on 55, but Haddin was eventually out for 34 attempting a big shot over mid-wicket, where he was caught in the deep by Strauss. Harmison took the wicket of Mitchell Johnson for a duck in the next over, and then removed Siddle and Clark in consecutive balls. Hilfenhaus survived the hat-trick ball, but the match only lasted another two overs as Hussey was caught by Cook at short leg off the bowling of Swann. England won the match by 197 runs, to claim a 2–1 series win.|$|E
500|$|A soldier {{under the}} command of Colonel Garnons Williams wrote an account of his {{commanding}} officer's death, which puts the date of his death as 27 September. Col Garnons Williams was in temporary command of the 12th Royal Fusiliers when on 25 September he led his battalion in an attack on German trenches. However, the flanks were exposed and on 27 September, Garnons Williams gave the order to retreat. He was at that moment shot in the head from a house nearby. The soldier who gave the account said: [...] "I was very sorry for him, as we could not have had a better, braver officer. He was with us {{all the time in the}} front trench, and looked after us as well as he could; no man could have done better. Nobody <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to him." [...] The following evening, the battalion was relieved, Garnons Williams being declared officially wounded and missing in action, unofficially reported killed.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{the test}} audience, {{television}} critics generally reacted positively to the pilot, viewing it as original and innovative, USA Today critic Tom Green summarized {{the show as}} a [...] "crisply funny blend of stand-up routines interwoven with more traditional sitcom stuff". Eric Mink of St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote he thought the show was unusual and intriguing, yet [...] "quite funny". Joe Stein of the San Diego Evening Tribune commented [...] "Not all standup comedians fit into a sitcom format, but Seinfeld does". A more negative response came from a The Fresno Bee critic, that stated [...] "I liked the concept, but Seinfeld 's jokes were so dull that you hoped the standup stuff would fly by so you <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to the story". Though the critic praised Alexander's acting he commented that his performance {{was not enough to}} keep the show [...] "from being just another piece of summer drivel offered up by a major commercial network".|$|E
500|$|At the February 19, 2011, date of The Monster Ball Tour, Gaga {{performed}} [...] "Born This Way" [...] as {{a second}} encore, using the same general attire and choreography as the Grammy performance, however the incubation vessel was not present and slight alterations {{were made in the}} outfits of her dancers. The track was then added to the set-list of the concert tour. Tris McCall from The Star-Ledger was most impressed with the performance, calling it {{one of the highlights of}} the concert. He added that [...] "reinterpretation of the single, which was far more Laura Nyro than Madonna, was such an improvement over the mechanized, tricked-out hit version that it was hard not to wish she <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to the studio and re-cut it before the album comes out." [...] Gaga performed an acoustic version on The Oprah Winfrey Show, in May 2011, along with another song from Born This Way, [...] "You and I". Sitting atop a high stool, Gaga—in a red leather blazer, a floppy mask-like hat and see-through leopard bodysuit—played a piano made out of a wire high-heel structure.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Café Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro {{is a type of}} eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; [...] "bistro" [...] means [...] "quickly" [...] in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks throughout the day.|$|E

500|$|Although the {{characters}} were separated on screen, they had gained a fan {{base on the}} Internet that believed Martha should be with Jack and wanted the pair to reunite. Gordon herself backed the pairing, stating that she believed they should be together. She said: [...] "I actually love Jack and Martha together, I'm a sucker for romance so, I want {{want them to be}} together [...] I want them to continue on, [...] the timing is not right, they are not mature enough. Jack's in a relationship with someone else as Martha is, there just seems to be things {{getting in the way of}} them getting back together all the time." [...] Gordon also hoped for a happy ending for the two characters if they were to ever leave the serial adding: [...] "If I had it my way, and I got to write the scripts then I'd make it happily ever after, Martha and Jack riding off into the sunset." [...] Gordon has spoken of her understanding from the audiences point of view, that together Jack and Martha are [...] "the ultimate couple". She also reiterated her belief that it would be to tough at the time of Martha's downward spiral for them to work together, but if Martha is to get through her troubles and have a happy ending, that it would be with Jack. The Daily Telegraph commented on the Martha and Jack situation, saying it is played out in a [...] "classic soapie technique". They said [...] "Bring {{the characters}} together, push them apart, but always leave open the possibility that they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> together.

500|$|When {{football}} season {{arrived in the}} fall, Chappuis {{was one of many}} veterans who returned to college and the gridiron after serving in the war. Many of the returning veterans were not in prime football condition {{at the start of the}} 1946 season, and Coach Fritz Crisler [...] "predicted it might be November before ex-servicemen were adjusted physically and mentally to play their top game." [...] Chappuis later recalled that he was 23years old when he returned to school, and some of the returning veterans [...] "didn't know if they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> into the rah-rah of college football, but Fritz took care of that. He really whipped us into shape." [...] Despite any difficulties in re-adjusting to civilian life and football, Chappuis broke Otto Graham's Big Nine Conference record for total offensive yards during the 1946 {{football season}}. Though reports differ as to Chappuis' total yards gained, University of Michigan records show that Chappuis gained 1,284yards in 1946—734yards passing, 501yards rushing and 49yards receiving. Chappuis set the new offensive mark in 1946 with a fractured bone in his wrist that he did not report until after the season had ended, at which time an operation was performed. Chappuis later said he knew the x-ray would reveal a fracture, and he would be benched before he even began. He delayed the examination until the season was over because [...] "the time to break into the lineup is prior to the first game. If I hadn't, there were so many capable candidates around who could have made good behind our front wall that I'd never have become a first-stringer by returning in the middle of the season." [...] Accordingly, Chappuis played the 1946 season with a fractured wrist and without even bothering to tape the wrist.|$|E

The EU's health commissioner, John Dalli, had formally criticised Germany earlier that day for rushing out [...] "premature conclusions" [...] about the source of an outbreak, and only helped to spread alarm among the public and farmers and untimely leading to the damaging the EU's agriculture sector. John Dalli also told the EU parliament in Strasbourg that claims had to be scientifically sound, unbiased, and fool-proof in nature before it was publicised in future.|$|E

[...] This was a major morale boost to the defenders. [...] However, no one <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> out to inform others of the success. [...] The Song officials considered that reinforcement lost and Xiangyang, doomed to fall {{from the lack of}} supplies, did not send more Song reinforcements afterwards. The high casualties and low success rates ended the transportation of further supplies.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1910, {{while he}} was working in Wilmington, Delaware, Fish met a 19-year-old man named Thomas Kedden. He took Kedden {{to where he was}} staying, and the two began a sadomasochistic relationship; it is unclear whether or not Fish forced Kedden to do these things, but in his {{confession}} he implies that the man was intellectually disabled. After ten days, Fish took Kedden to [...] "an old farm house", where he began to torture him. The torture took place over two weeks. Fish eventually tied Kedden up and cut off half of his penis. [...] "I shall never forget his scream, or the look he gave me," [...] Fish later recalled. He originally intended to kill Kedden, cut up his body, and take it home, but he feared the hot weather would draw attention to him; instead, Fish poured peroxide over the wound, wrapped it in a Vaseline-covered handkerchief, left a $10 bill, kissed Kedden goodbye, and left. [...] "Took first train I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> home. Never heard what become of him, or tried to find out," [...] Fish said.|$|E

Over the years, he went from being the crew's best friend and just being grateful for the work and all of that to realizing that he was going to be a movie star and wanting to move on. Part of that was because of his strained relationship with Cybill. That sometimes made the set a very unpleasant place to be. Cybill – I got along with her very well at times, other times I’d have to be the one who said you have to come out of the trailer and go to work. In fairness to her, she was in the makeup chair at six thirty in the morning with pages of dialogue she hadn’t seen before, she'd work very long hours, and then be back in the makeup chair at six thirty the next morning." ...|$|E

2500|$|Livsey's debut for Hampshire came on 30 June 1913 against Oxford University CC at the County Ground, Southampton. He scored 11* and 7*, {{taking two}} catches and making one stumping.

Batting at number ten in the order, Livsey was not out on many occasions, 20 of his 37 innings during this season alone and across his whole career he was not out on 137 occasions. He scored only 130 runs in the 1914 season, with a high score of 42* and an average of 7.64, however he took 39 catches and completed 23 stumpings.
