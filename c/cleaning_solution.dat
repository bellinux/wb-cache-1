5|$|Upon her joining, {{however, the}} members of the group are {{targeted}} and murdered one by one. All of their deaths relate to their fears: Mark falls down an elevator shaft, trying to escape from the darkness when the lights go out, and is torn in half. Paul accidentally consumes a cockroach while eating a bag of chips; he is given <b>cleaning</b> <b>solution</b> by a masked figure, and upon drinking it, burns a hole in his throat. Laura begins to suspect these deaths are not accidental. The hospital loses power, leaving Laura, Alison, Darren, Nicky, Dr. Jessica Ryan, and the receptionist Gloria in the dark. Gloria goes to the basement to turn the lights back on, but once the patients return to their rooms, Alison is tied to her bed by the Boogeyman. He places maggots on her arms, which burrow into her skin via her self-inflicted incisions, and she kills herself attempting to cut them out.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this study, various <b>cleaning</b> <b>solutions</b> {{containing}} {{chelating agents}} with carboxyl acid group (COOH), such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, citric acid and oxalic acid, were developed for post-poly-Si CMP cleaning. The chelating agent and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) were simultaneously added into 2 % ammonium hydroxide alkaline solution {{to promote the}} removal efficiency on particles and metallic impurities. The effectiveness of various cleaning recipes and their interaction mechanism with poly-Si surface were studied. We could explain the surface behavior of various <b>cleaning</b> <b>solutions</b> by the different molecular size and charge of chelating agents. Based on the mechanism, the behavior of surface particle and metallic impurity can be realized. The co-existence of TMAH with citric acid or oxalic acid in the alkaline <b>cleaning</b> <b>solutions</b> can significantly enhance the electrical property for the capacitor.

50|$|Beside high {{mechanical}} energy, higher cleaning {{temperatures are}} one of the most effective methods of improving the cleaning results in a parts washer. In general, a 10 to 15 °F (5 to 8 °C) rise doubles the chemical reaction of the detergent. The increased chemical reaction between the greases and oils and the detergent delivers faster cleaning cycles and cleaner parts. Additionally, all greases and oils exhibit a lower viscosity at higher temperatures. <b>Cleaning</b> <b>solution</b> temperatures of 170 F and above softens or melts most oils and greases causing them to flow like water so they are easily removed resulting in faster cleaning, better results and cleaner parts. Many parts washers are not capable of maintaining this operating temperature due to the lack of amply heating systems. Additionally, careful design is required of the pumping system so it can pull in and deliver <b>cleaning</b> <b>solution</b> at temperatures that approach boiling in the parts washer. All centrifugal pumps require a net positive suction head (NPSHr) in order to be able to pump solution. As the temperature of the solution approaches the NPSHr, the pump stops pumping because the <b>cleaning</b> <b>solution</b> flashes to steam in the pump intake. Careful design of the pump is required to minimize NPSHr and allow pumping of high temperature <b>cleaning</b> <b>solution.</b>|$|E
