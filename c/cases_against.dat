5|$|In 1994 and 2004 Croatian {{authorities}} filed {{two separate}} <b>cases</b> <b>against</b> {{a total of}} 17 persons, including Devetak, and indicted them on charges of genocide and war crimes committed against the civilian population of Lovas. The group included fifteen who were tried in absentia. In 2009, the process was split for Milan Tepavac and Ilija Vorkapić who were available to Croatian authorities, and once more a year later when Tepavac was judged not fit to stand trial. Vorkapić was acquitted in 2012.|$|E

In 2009, two separate documents from Jilin province and Liaoning Province described how legal <b>cases</b> <b>against</b> Falun Gong practitioners {{must be approved}} and/or audited by the 610 Office. The 610 Office's organizational proximity to the CPC's Political and Judicial Committee better enables it to exercise influence with the Supreme People's Court and Ministry of Justice, both at the central level and with their counterparts at local levels.|$|E
5|$|On August 30, 1972, all {{the cases}} were {{consolidated}} into a single case to determine liability. The <b>cases</b> <b>against</b> the United States, Hughes Airwest, and Hughes Air Corporation were consolidated into a single class-action lawsuit in October 1972. On April 5, 1973, Hughes Airwest and the US Government agreed not to contest the issue of liability. Most claimants settled by December 1973 for payments of various negotiated amounts.|$|E

5|$|After relegation from Scotland's top flight, East Stirlingshire was {{controversially}} {{merged with}} Clydebank Juniors in 1964. The new club was renamed East Stirlingshire Clydebank– often E.S. Clydebank for short– and relocated to Kilbowie Park in Clydebank against fans' wishes. However, the merge lasted only one season, with East Stirlingshire shareholders winning several court <b>cases</b> <b>against</b> it {{and thus the}} club reverted to its original legal status and moved back to Falkirk. During the single season as E.S. Clydebank, the club set a record attendance at Kilbowie Park when 14,900 spectators attended a Scottish Cup first round replay against Hibernian in February 1965.|$|E
5|$|Heydrich's widow Lina won {{the right}} to a pension {{following}} a series of court <b>cases</b> <b>against</b> the West German government in 1956 and 1959. She was declared entitled to a substantial pension as her husband was a German general killed in action. The government had previously declined to pay due to Heydrich's role in the Holocaust. The couple had four children: Klaus, born in 1933, killed in a traffic accident in 1943; Heider, born in 1934; Silke, born in 1939; and Marte, born shortly after her father's death in 1942. Lina wrote a memoir, Leben mit einem Kriegsverbrecher (Living With a War Criminal), which was published in 1976. She remarried once and died in 1985.|$|E

5|$|Mansfield {{ordered a}} hearing for 22 January 1772. Following an adjournment, {{the case was}} not heard until 7 February 1772. In the meantime, the case had {{attracted}} {{a great deal of}} attention in the press, and members of the public were forthcoming with donations to fund lawyers for both sides of the argument. An activist layman, Granville Sharp, who continually sought test <b>cases</b> <b>against</b> the legal justifications for slavery, was Somersett's real backer. When the case was heard, no fewer than five advocates appeared for the slave, speaking at three separate hearings between February and May. These lawyers included William Davy SL, John Glynn SL, James Mansfield and Francis Hargrave, who was later to become a noted barrister based on his work in this case. Charles Stewart was represented by John Dunning and James Wallace.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{both parties}} were {{concerned}} {{with the growth of}} the power of trusts and monopolies, {{and one of the first}} acts of the 51st Congress was to pass the Sherman Antitrust Act, sponsored by Senator John Sherman of Ohio. The Act passed by wide margins in both houses, and Harrison signed it into law. The Sherman Act was the first Federal act of its kind, and marked a new use of federal government power. While Harrison approved of the law and its intent, his administration was not particularly vigorous in enforcing it. However, the government successfully concluded a case during Harrison's time in office (against a Tennessee coal company), and had initiated several other <b>cases</b> <b>against</b> trusts.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} effect of Peterloo was {{a crackdown on}} reform. The government instructed the police and courts {{to go after the}} journalists, presses and publication of the Manchester Observer. Wroe {{was arrested and charged with}} producing a seditious publication. Found guilty he was sentenced to twelve months in prison and fined £100. Outstanding court <b>cases</b> <b>against</b> the Manchester Observer were rushed through the courts and a continual change of sub-editors was not sufficient defence against a series of police raids, often on the suspicion that someone was writing a radical article. The Manchester Observer closed in February 1820.|$|E

5|$|Three {{days after}} taking office, Alfonsín sent {{a bill to}} the Congress to revoke the self-amnesty law {{established}} by the military. This {{made it possible for}} the judiciary to investigate the crimes committed during the Dirty War. During the campaign, Alfonsín had promised that he would do this while Luder had been non-committal. Alfonsín also ordered the initiation of judicial <b>cases</b> <b>against</b> guerrilla leaders Mario Firmenich, Fernando Vaca Narvaja, Ricardo Obregón Cano, Rodolfo Galimberti, Roberto Perdía, Héctor Pardo and Enrique Gorriarán Merlo; and military leaders Jorge Videla, Emilio Massera, Orlando Agosti, Roberto Viola, Armando Lambruschini, Omar Graffigna, Leopoldo Galtieri, Jorge Anaya and Basilio Dami Dozo. He also requested the extradition of guerrilla leaders who were living abroad.|$|E
5|$|When The Daily Californian {{published}} {{excerpts from}} the Argonne letter on June 11, the DOE obtained {{a court order to}} prevent further publication. Undeterred, The Daily Californian published the letter in its entirety on June 13. In September, the DOE declared the Hansen letter to be classified and obtained a temporary restraining order prohibiting The Daily Californian from publishing it, but the Hansen letter was published by the Madison Press Connection on September 16. The government then moved to dismiss their <b>cases</b> <b>against</b> both The Progressive and The Daily Californian as moot.|$|E
5|$|As president, Zardari {{remained}} a strong U.S. {{ally in the}} war in Afghanistan, despite prevalent public disapproval of the United States following the Raymond Davis incident and the Nato attack in Salala in 2011. Domestically, Zardari achieved the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment in 2010, which constitutionally reduced his presidential powers. His attempt to prevent the reinstatement of Supreme Court judges failed in the face of massive protests led by his political rival Nawaz Sharif. The restored Supreme Court dismissed the PPP's elected Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani for contempt in 2012, after Gillani refused to write to the Government of Switzerland to reopen corruption <b>cases</b> <b>against</b> Zardari. Zardari's tenure was also criticised for mishandling nationwide floods in 2010, and growing terrorist violence. Following multiple bombings of Hazaras in Quetta in early 2013, Zardari dismissed his provincial government in Balochistan.|$|E

5|$|Crowley left Busch and {{returned}} to London, where he took Pearl Brooksmith as his new Scarlet Woman. Undergoing further nasal surgery, it was here in 1932 that {{he was invited to}} be guest of honour at Foyles' Literary Luncheon, also being invited by Harry Price to speak at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research. In need of money, he launched a series of court <b>cases</b> <b>against</b> people whom he believed had libelled him, some of which proved successful. He gained much publicity for his lawsuit against Constable and Co for publishing Nina Hamnett's Laughing Torso (1932) – a book he thought libelled him – but lost the case. The court case added to Crowley's financial problems, and in February 1935 he was declared bankrupt. During the hearing, it was revealed that Crowley had been spending three times his income for several years.|$|E
5|$|Customs, {{traditions and}} moral {{principles}} based on Buddhism {{were used as}} the bases of law. Specific laws were eventually developed and adopted. Samantapasadika, a 5th-century commentary, gives details of complex regulations on the theft of fish. The chief judicial officer was known as viniccayamacca and there were several judicial officers under him, known as vinicchayaka. Apart from them, village headmen and provincial governors were also given the power to issue judgments. The king was the final judge in legal disputes, and all <b>cases</b> <b>against</b> {{members of the royal}} family and high dignitaries of the state were judged by him. However, the king had to exercise this power with care and after consulting with his advisers. Udaya I recorded judgments that were regarded as important precedents in the royal library in order to maintain uniformity in judicial decisions.|$|E
5|$|Henry III {{decided that}} Bedford Castle should be {{returned}} to its original owner, William de Beauchamp, and became increasingly frustrated with Falkes' refusal to do so; matters came to a head when Falkes' castellans imprisoned Henry of Braybrooke, a royal judge who was hearing law <b>cases</b> <b>against</b> Falkes. When Falkes refused to release the judge, Henry mobilised an army, supported by the Church in the form of Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and advanced to Bedford. Falkes had left the castle, along with around eighty men, in charge of his brother, William de Breauté, who refused to surrender it to the king. Falkes was probably hoping that if the castle held on long enough, his efforts to convince Pope Honorius III to intervene against Henry would succeed. The Archbishop excommunicated William and the siege began.|$|E
