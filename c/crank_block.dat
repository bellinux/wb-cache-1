40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, due to {{the huge}} energy consumption, the {{energy-saving}} problems of the product have been emphasized with many designers. In this paper, informed by the modular design method, the total energy performance in modular product can be analyzed and separated into the energy performances of basic modules. And with the physical analysis of basic modules, the energy equations are established with the band graphs theory. Then, the physical parameters, which could influence the energy consumption, are identified as “energy factor”. Thus, the energy consumption of the modules could be optimized with adjusting design factors, and the energy-saving design scheme for the whole product is obtained in the optimized model. Finally, the model and the method in this paper are demonstrated by an instance of the <b>crank</b> <b>block</b> pump...|$|E
50|$|By 1966 {{all major}} engine parts - <b>block,</b> <b>crank,</b> rods, pistons and {{flywheel}} were {{unique to the}} Lotus engine. By the end of production, some 55,000 units had been built.|$|R
50|$|Lotus used Ford Kent engines on Lotus Mk.VII to {{establish}} its corporate foundation, and subsequently used {{most of the}} Cosworth early racing engines for the legendary success in motorsport. Lotus also built the successful Lotus TwinCam engine for Lotus Elan on the Kent <b>block,</b> <b>crank</b> and conrods.|$|R
40|$|When {{multifunctional}} pipeline repair machinery (MPRM) {{is used in}} {{the deep}} sea area, it is difficult to grip the pipeline and ensure concentricity between the cutter heads and the pipeline during its operation. In view of this, a new system of two-arm holding self-centering pipeline clamping device was proposed. The system is composed of two groups of parallelogram double-rocker mechanism and <b>cranking</b> <b>block</b> mechanism which are symmetrically distributed on the frame. The geometric parameter solutions of the clamping device were analyzed with motion and transmission as the constraints. A mechanical model was established to associate the friction torque of clamping points with the driving force. Clamping device and machinery were designed and manufactured for the Ø 304. 8 – 457. 2  mm pipelines used in this test. ADAMS simulation experiments were conducted underwater, and the cutting and beveling tests were carried out onshore. The following results are achieved. First, the smaller the pipe diameter, the smaller the transmission angle of the oscillating slider mechanism; the longer the hydraulic cylinder stroke, the greater the transmission angle of the double rocker mechanism. Second, the driving force of the clamping device increases with the increase of the pipe diameter. When the diameter reaches 457. 2  mm, the hydraulic cylinder driving force of the clamping device should be greater than 10219  N. Third, the feed rate of the cutters increases suddenly due to the slight shaking of the machinery which occurs {{at the beginning of the}} pipe cutting, so it is necessary to adopt a small feed rate. And fourth, onshore experiment results agree well with the theoretical design and simulation results, proving the rationality of the system. The research results in this paper provide technical basis for the research and development of similar engineering prototypes...|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} Packards to date, the Model G's engine was {{placed under the}} driver's bench and {{laterally}} mounted, the crank protruding out of the right side. As mentioned, it {{was derived from the}} single-cylinder variant for which Packard already had a good reputation. Construction consisted of two single-cylinder engines that were connected in a horizontal opposed position and worked on a common <b>crank</b> shaft. <b>Blocks</b> were cast iron with non-detachable cylinder heads. Cylinders had a bore and stroke of 6 x 6 1/2 in. (152.4 × 165.1 mm) each, resulting in a displacement of 184 c.i (3,015 cm³) per cylinder and huge 368 c.i. (6,030 cm³) for the whole engine. Packard used a Longuemar float-feed carburetor for each cylinder. Ignition advance was manual. Power rating (following then-actual practice) was 24 H.P.|$|R
5000|$|Toyota {{never made}} a wide-valve angle [...] "7A-GE" [...] based on the 7A, but many enthusiasts have created one using a {{combination}} of 7A-FE parts (<b>block</b> and <b>crank),</b> 4A-GE parts (head, pistons) and custom connecting rods. The '7A-FE' has a smaller crank journal, and smaller wrist pins (press fit) so a few companies have made special rods to accommodate these builds. Likewise, an unofficial supercharged [...] "7A-GZE" [...] has also been built from 7A-FE parts (<b>block,</b> <b>crank),</b> 4A-GZE parts (head, pistons) and custom connecting rods.|$|R
50|$|In Japan, {{as well as}} a {{few other}} export locations, the VTi was offered with two {{different}} motors: the B16A2/3 (160 PS DOHC VTEC) and the D15B (130 PS SOHC VTEC). The D15B shares the same head as the US Civic Si (D16Z6) but features a unique <b>block,</b> <b>crank,</b> and rods. the car shared the 1.5 L displacement of the other D15 blocks, but the rods were the same length as the D16's (137mm) and a better rod to stroke ratio (1.63) rather than the normal D15's ratio of 1.59. Despite this, the crank and bearing sizes were not the same.|$|R
5000|$|The C2 /1 2.7 {{used the}} 325e eta model engine <b>block,</b> <b>crank</b> and rods, but with custom flat head pistons {{provided}} by MAHLE. Originally Alpina modified the [...] "200" [...] casting number cylinder head {{specific to the}} 325e with bigger intake valves, larger air intake ports, and redesigned the valve chamber for better flow. A more aggressive camshaft was used, with higher lift and duration, and harder valve springs were installed. Compression ratio was increased to 10.2:1. The C2/1 2.7 made 210 bhp with 267 Nm of torque and was the fastest E30 {{available at the time}} (227 km/h top speed). 108 cars were built.|$|R
5000|$|Adhering to Sir William Lyons' maxim of [...] "grace, {{pace and}} space", the Mark 2 was a fast and capable saloon. It {{came with a}} [...] , [...] or [...] Jaguar XK engine. The 3.8 {{is similar to the}} unit used in the 3.8 E-Type (called XKE in the USA), having the same <b>block,</b> <b>crank,</b> {{connecting}} rods and pistons but different inlet manifold and carburation (two SUs versus three on the E-Type in Europe) and therefore [...] less. The head of the six-cylinder engine in the Mark 2 had curved ports compared to the straight ports of the E-Type configuration. The 3.4 Litre and 3.8 Litre cars were fitted with twin SU HD6 carburettors and the 2.4 Litre with twin Solex carburettors.|$|R
50|$|The FP is {{very close}} to the FS in many ways and shares a large {{percentage}} of parts but has its own FP specific <b>block,</b> <b>crank,</b> rods, pistons and timing belt. The pistons for the FS produce a compression ratio of 9.1:1 (USDM) but when FP pistons are used in the FS they yield 9.7:1 compression ratio. The biggest performance difference is that the European 1.8L FP & 2.0L FS both have maximum compression of 15.0 bar (213 PSI) vs the North American 2.0L FS which has a maximum compression of 11.5 bar (170 PSI). The KL & FS ATX engines both require 10° BTDC ignition timing while the FS MTX & FP require 12° BTDC. The FP does not share the same G25M-R transmission as the FS. In the Protegé it uses a F25M-R instead.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the rifle}} ready to fire, {{pressing}} the trigger would cause movement of a connector bar extending forward toward the magazine well; the connector bar movement would then cause the sear {{to move out}} of engagement with the striker and cause the chambered round to fire. (In common with bullpup rifles, which also separate the trigger from the firing mechanism, the T1 was reported to suffer from a relatively poor trigger pull feel; during at least one series of tests the connector bar broke). When the breech block mechanism cycled, the <b>crank</b> would momentarily <b>block</b> the line of sight (Army riflemen testing this rifle apparently got used to this effect quickly, but there were negative comments in the test reports regarding the crank striking the edge of the Brodie helmet then standard issue in the U.S. Army as well as damaging the brims of the felt campaign hats then worn as part of the field uniform).|$|R
40|$|This {{treatise}} {{investigates the}} underlying {{factors that are}} hindering the improvement of Overall Equipment Effectiveness at the Ford Struandale Engine Plant. In January of 2008 the Ford Motor Company announced plans to invest more than R 1. 5 billion to expand operations {{for the production of}} Ford's next-generation compact pickup truck and the PUMA diesel engine. Ford will use the investment to expand operations both in Silverton for the production of 75 000 units of a new bakkie and in Port Elizabeth for 220 000 units of its new-generation PUMA diesel engines ([URL] / 2008 / 01 / 31 /ford-to-invest- 209 m-in-south-africa-for-new-ranger-pickup/). Only five Ford plants globally will be producing the PUMA engine (Turkey, UK, Thailand, Argentina and South Africa – Ford Struandale Engine Plant). The Ford Struandale Engine Plant will be the only plant which will have the I 4 assembly, I 5 assembly and 3 C (<b>Crank,</b> Cylinder <b>Block,</b> and Cylinder Head) machining and the expectations of operating in a lean environment is high. The management team at the Ford Struandale Engine Plant needs to understand what the underlying factors that are hindering the improvement of Overall Equipment Effectiveness of the plant or, in other words, they need to be informed of the total benefits of TPM. A literature review was conducted to determine what the theory reveals about Overall Equipment Effectiveness, the three factors of OEE (Availability, Performance Efficiency, and Quality), the influence of Six Big Losses on each of the factors and the role of Total Productive Maintenance in improving OEE by eliminating these Six Big Losses. A Ford literature study was conducted to reveal the current literature being applied at Ford. This was then followed by an empirical survey conducted within the Ford Struandale Engine Plant. In addition, a task team formed to analyse the current maintenance operating strategy. Finally, the findings from discussions with the task team, the empirical survey, Ford Struandale Engine Plant literature survey and a general literature survey were amalgamated to draw conclusions relating to the Ford Struandale Engine Plant. These conclusions indicate what the underlying factors are that are hindering the improvement of Overall Equipment Effectiveness of the Ford Struandale Engine Plant facilities and equipment. Then recommendations are made as to how the Ford Struandale Engine Plant can improve the Overall Equipment Effectiveness of its facilities and equipmen...|$|R

40|$|Closed-loop {{combustion}} control (CLCC) in gasoline engines can improve efficiency, calibration effort, and performance using different fuels. Knowledge of in-cylinder pressures {{is a key}} requirement for CLCC. Adaptive cylinder pressure reconstruction offers a realistic alternative to direct sensing, which is otherwise necessary as legislation requires continued reductions in CO 2 and exhaust emissions. Direct sensing however is expensive and may not prove adequately robust. A new approach is developed for in-cylinder pressure reconstruction on gasoline engines. The approach uses Time-Delay feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks trained with the standard Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The same approach {{can be applied to}} reconstruction via measured crank kinematics obtained from a shaft encoder, or measured engine cylinder block vibrations obtained from a production knock sensor. The basis of the procedure is initially justified by examination of the information content within measured data, which is considered to be equally important as the network architecture and training methodology. Key hypotheses are constructed and tested using data taken from a 3 -cylinder (DISI) engine to reveal the influence of the data information content on reconstruction potential. The findings of these hypotheses tests are then used to develop the methodology. The approach is tested by reconstructing cylinder pressure across a wide range of steady-state engine operation using both measured <b>crank</b> kinematics and <b>block</b> accelerations. The results obtained show a very marked improvement over previously published reconstruction accuracy for both crank kinematics and cylinder block vibration based reconstruction using measurements obtained from a multi-cylinder engine. The paper shows that by careful processing of measured engine data, a standard neural network architecture and a standard training algorithm can be used to very accurately reconstruct engine cylinder pressure with high levels of robustness and efficiency...|$|R
