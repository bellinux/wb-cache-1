40|$|Diarrhea in {{suckling}} piglets caused by Clostridium perfringens type A was diagnosed in industrial (technified) swine farms {{of the states}} of Minas Gerais and SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil), based on isolation and identification of bacterium by biochemical tests, detection of alpha toxin in animal bioassays, and PCR. This {{seems to be the}} first report of <b>clostridial</b> <b>enterotoxaemia</b> in piglets by C. perfringens type A in Brazil and allowed specific procedures to control the disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} investigation arose out of {{the observation}} of a high mortality rate in lambs belonging to a "closed" flock of Leccese sheep reared in Apulia region. The {{most common cause of}} death in the flock (34 out of 42 lambs) was enterotoxaemia caused by Clostridum perfringens. Due to the high inbreeding level in this population, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether inbreeding in Leccese lambs decreases their resistance to <b>clostridial</b> <b>enterotoxaemia.</b> All the animals were initially grouped into two classes (outbred, inbred) on the basis of their inbreeding coefficient. The percentage of dead lambs in outbred class was significantly different if compared to that found in inbred class (7. 14 % vs 71. 43 % respectively, P< 0. 001). No significant difference was observed by comparing animals with different inbreeding coefficient (F< 10 % vs F? 10 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Nine eastern black {{rhinoceroses}} (Diceros bicornis michaeli) developed clinical <b>clostridial</b> <b>enterotoxaemia</b> between May and July 2010 in the Pyramid Black Rhino Sanctuary {{within the}} Ol Jogi Conservancy, Laikipia, Kenya. The rhinos {{presented with a}} peracute syndrome characterised by severe abdominal pain manifested by struggling and rolling on the ground, laboured breathing and died within three hours after being sighted sick. Necropsy and histopathology revealed severe pathology in the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT). Grossly, the small and large intestines were congested and oedematous. All the rhinos had variable amounts of hemorrhagic fluid in the intestines. Microscopically, the most characteristic lesion was severe necrotising-haemorrhagic enteritis. Numerous gram-positive rod-shaped bacterial colonies that were identified to be Clostridium spp were occasionally seen in the intestinal mucosa. Clostridium perfringens type A was isolated from the stomach contents. C. perfringens was postulated as the aetiological agent with the infection triggered probably by change of habitat following a prolonged period of drought {{that was followed by}} above normal rainfall...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out in the South of Italy to assess the role of clostridia in {{neonatal}} diseases of lambs and kids. Eighty-seven lambs and 15 kids belonging to 25 flocks were examined and Clostridium perftingens was the microorganism most commonly identified. C perfringens isolates were analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), {{in order to determine the}} prevalence of the genes cpa, cpb, cpb 2, etx, iap and cpe. The most prevalent toxin-type of C perfringens was found to be type A found in 84 % of the cases with <b>clostridial</b> <b>enterotoxaemia.</b> No C perfringens type B, C or E were found. C peifringens type D was isolated in 16 % of the cases. About 24 % of the isolates were cpb 2 positive. The prevalence of cpb 2 across the different C perfringens types varied. The beta(2) -toxin gene cpb 2 was detected in 4 / 21 (191 / 0) type A isolates, in 1 / 2 type D isolates, and in 1 / 2 type DE (cpe-carrying type D) isolates. The high rate of positivity to cpb 2 among the isolates suggests that a vaccine based on the beta(2) -toxin, should be included in the vaccination schedule of the animals to confer adequate protection and to prevent the disease...|$|E
