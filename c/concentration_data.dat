This allows for a simple parameter to test the ultra-low fouling capabilities of polymer films. Another parameter for protein resistance is the film thickness. Also measured by ellipsometry, a film thickness too small or too large results in increased protein adsorption, indicating that some optimal value unique to the surface must be reached to achieve ultra-low fouling.|$|E

50|$|In {{determining}} bioequivalence, for example, {{between two}} {{products such as}} a commercially available Brand product and a potential to-be-marketed Generic product, pharmacokinetic studies are conducted whereby each of the preparations are administered in a cross-over study to volunteer subjects, generally healthy individuals but occasionally in patients. Serum/plasma samples are obtained at regular intervals and assayed for parent drug (or occasionally metabolite) concentration. Occasionally, blood concentration levels are neither feasible or possible to compare the two products (e.g. inhaled corticosteroids), then pharmacodynamic endpoints rather than pharmacokinetic endpoints (see below) are used for comparison. For a pharmacokinetic comparison, the plasma <b>concentration</b> <b>data</b> are used to assess key pharmacokinetic parameters such as area under the curve (AUC), peak concentration (Cmax), time to peak concentration (Tmax), and absorption lag time (tlag). Testing should be conducted at several different doses, especially when the drug displays non-linear pharmacokinetics.|$|E
50|$|Typically the eluent of the SEC {{column is}} allowed to pass through both a {{refractive}} index detector (that gives measures for the concentration in the solution as a function time) and through a laser scattering cell. The scattered intensity is measured {{as a function of}} time under a small angle with respect to the laser beam. The low-angle light scattering data can be analyzed if one assumes that the low-angle data {{is the same as the}} scattering at zero angle. For the relevant equations, see the article on static light scattering. Under these conditions the laser signal together with the <b>concentration</b> <b>data</b> can be translated into a curve that yields both the Mn and the Mw, the molar mass weighted by number and by weight respectively. The combination of those two data gives information on the linearity of the polymer.|$|E
50|$|Probabilistic {{models are}} based on the Monte Carlo method where {{distributions}} of data from various sources are randomly sampled from to calculate percentile statistics. Such probabilistic techniques typically utilise product or consumption survey data from a sample population combined with distributions of substances that may be found within those foods or products. For example, The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggest that the estimation of intake of substances in food can be probabilistically conducted through food consumption surveys (NHANES/CSFII) from sample populations combined with distributions of substance <b>concentration</b> <b>data</b> to calculate the Estimated Daily Intake. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) funded the Monte Carlo Risk Assessment (MCRA) tool to estimate usual intake exposure distributions based on statistical models which utilise the EFSA Comprehensive Database, which contains detailed food consumption survey data. EFSA also funded Creme Global to develop a model and databases of European food consumption on which statistical models can be run to assess intake and exposure on a pan-European basis.|$|E

50|$|The {{concentration}} of a vapor {{in contact with}} its liquid, especially at equilibrium, is often {{expressed in terms of}} vapor pressure, which will be a partial pressure (a part of the total gas pressure) if any other gas(es) are present with the vapor. The equilibrium vapor pressure of a liquid is in general strongly dependent on temperature. At vapor-liquid equilibrium, a liquid with individual components in certain concentrations will have an equilibrium vapor in which the concentrations or partial pressures of the vapor components have certain values depending on all of the liquid component concentrations and the temperature. The converse is also true: if a vapor with components at certain concentrations or partial pressures is in vapor-liquid equilibrium with its liquid, then the component concentrations in the liquid will be determined dependent on the vapor concentrations and on the temperature. The equilibrium {{concentration of}} each component in the liquid phase is often different from its concentration (or vapor pressure) in the vapor phase, but there is a relationship. The VLE <b>concentration</b> <b>data</b> can be determined experimentally, or computed or approximated with the help of theories such as Raoult's law, Dalton's law, and Henry's law.|$|E
5000|$|Because an organism’s {{metabolome}} {{is largely}} defined by its genome, different species will have different metabolomes.

Furthermore, different tissues, different organs and biofluids associated with those organs and tissues can also have distinctly different metabolomes. The fact that different organisms and different tissues/biofluids have such different metabolomes has {{led to the development of}} a number of organism-specific of biofluid-specific metabolome databases.
