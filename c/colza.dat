25|$|The burners for {{the lights}} were changed from <b>colza</b> oil to {{paraffin}} oil in 1876. The original system was in use for 60 years, and in 1925, the optical apparatus was upgraded to a second order dioptric lens with an incandescent oil burner. This changed the light output to three flashes in quick succession every 30 seconds. A diesel electric plant was installed in 1954, and electrical operation of the beam started in October of that year. The diesel generator was replaced in 1970. In September 1999, the light was replaced again, {{this time with a}} rotating beacon, with a 35-watt halogen bulb as the light source. The energy comes from solar panels and a battery bank.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} {{illumination}} had generally been wood pyres or burning coal. The Argand lamp, invented in 1782 by the Swiss scientist, Aim√© Argand, revolutionized lighthouse illumination with its steady smokeless flame. Early models used ground glass which was sometimes tinted around the wick. Later models used a mantle of thorium dioxide suspended over the flame, creating a bright, steady light. The Argand lamp used whale oil, <b>colza,</b> olive oil or other vegetable oil as fuel which was supplied by a gravity feed from a reservoir mounted above the burner. The lamp was first produced by Matthew Boulton, {{in partnership with}} Argand, in 1784 and became the standard for lighthouses for over a century.|$|E
60|$|But when Mr Rubb came, {{she went}} down to see him. How much Mr Rubb knew of her affairs,--how far he might be in Miss <b>Colza's</b> confidence,--she did not know; but his conduct to her had not been offensive, {{and she had been}} pleased when she learned that the first half year's {{interest}} had been paid to her sister-in-law.|$|R
60|$|But {{now they}} descended, each gentleman taking his allotted lady, and <b>Colza's</b> voice was again heard. At {{the bottom of}} the stairs, just behind the dining-room door, stood the tyrant, looking very great, {{repressing}} with his left hand the housemaid who was behind him. She having observed Sarah {{at the top of the}} kitchen stairs telegraphing for assistance, had endeavoured to make her way to her friend while Tom Mackenzie and Mrs Slumpy were still upon the stairs; but the tyrant, though he had seen the cook's distress, had refused and sternly kept the girl a prisoner behind him. Ruat dinner, fiat genteel deportment.|$|R
6000|$|The other {{cultivated}} {{forms of}} the genus Brassica are descended, according to the view adopted by Godron and Metzger (9/75. Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 54; Metzger 'Kohlarten' s. 10.), from two species, B. napus and rapa; but according to other botanists from three species; whilst others again strongly suspect that all these forms, both wild and cultivated, ought to be ranked as a single species. Brassica napus {{has given rise to}} two large groups, namely, Swedish turnips (believed to be of hybrid origin) (9/76. 'Gardener's Chronicle and Agricult. Gazette' 1856 page 729. See more especially ibid 1868 page 275: the writer asserts that he planted a variety of cabbage (B. oleracea) close to turnips (B. rapa) and raised from the crossed seedlings true Swedish turnips. These latter plants ought, therefore, to be classed with cabbages or turnips, and not under B. napus.) and <b>Colzas,</b> the seeds of which yield oil. Brassica rapa (of Koch) has also given rise to two races, namely, common turnips and the oil-giving rape. The evidence is unusually clear that these latter plants, though so different in external appearance, belong to the same species; for the turnip has been observed by Koch and Godron to lose its thick roots in uncultivated soil; and when rape and turnips are sown together they cross {{to such a degree that}} scarcely a single plant comes true. (9/77. 'Gardener's Chronicle and Agricult. Gazette' 1855 page 730.) Metzger by culture converted the biennial or winter rape into the annual or summer rape,--varieties which have been thought by some authors to be specifically distinct. (9/78. Metzger, 'Kohlarten' s. 51.) ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} form of train lighting {{was provided}} by <b>Colza</b> oil lamps. The next stage was gas lighting, using compressed gas stored in cylinders under the coaches. [...] Finally, electric lighting was introduced.|$|E
2500|$|The {{light was}} visible for [...] {{and had a}} {{characteristic}} five-second flash followed by a 55-second eclipse. [...] The entire apparatus rotated once every two minutes. [...] It was operated by a clockwork mechanism and the lamps consumed 3 gallons of coconut oil per week. [...] In 1862, <b>colza</b> oil {{and later in the}} century, [...] kerosene were used as fuel. The octagonal lantern was [...] high, and glazed with 160 panes of [...] thick glass.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} apparatus was {{a revolving}} first order Chance Brothers apparatus which showed a light characteristic of one white flash every two minutes, visible for [...] The light source was an Argand lamp fueled by <b>Colza</b> oil or Rapeseed oil. Rotation {{was achieved by}} a clockwork mechanism {{that had to be}} wound regularly. Also built in the station were quarters for the head keeper and three assistant keepers, and their families, built of timber framed weather board and iron roofs.|$|E
2500|$|The tower on Chantry Island is [...] tall, with a {{focal plane}} height of [...] It {{is made of}} {{limestone}} reinforced with lumber, and the top section is made of granite for extra rigidity. There are 115 steps from the bottom to the lantern room. According to the Heritage Character Statement from the Government of Canada, the tower's design is very strong. The report discusses the [...] "magnificent twelve-sided polygonal lantern" [...] and the various ornate features. The gallery at the top is a round tapered and corbelled base that houses the 12-sided polygonal Fresnel lantern, which includes three rows of rectangular glass panes. The Fresnel lens was originally developed for lighthouses by French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel. All of the lenses for the Imperial Towers were [...] manufactured by the Louis Saulter Company of Paris. The powerful (second-order) lens was installed by specialist workmen from France. In 1859, Sperm oil was burned to illuminate the lamps but in 1860, a switch was made to <b>colza</b> oil since it was less expensive and more reliable in the coldest weather.|$|E
60|$|On the Monday {{she went}} to the house in Gower Street, and communicated to them {{the fact that she had}} left the Cedars. Miss <b>Colza</b> was in the room with her {{sister-in-law}} and nieces, and as it was soon evident that Miss <b>Colza</b> knew the whole history of her misfortune with reference to the property, she talked about her affairs before Miss <b>Colza</b> as though that young lady had been one of her late brother's family. But yet she felt that she did not like Miss <b>Colza,</b> and once or twice felt almost inclined to resent certain pushing questions which Miss <b>Colza</b> addressed to her.|$|E
60|$|The {{conversation}} {{was interrupted by}} Miss <b>Colza,</b> who came and stood opposite to them.|$|E
60|$|Then Margaret {{understood}} why Miss <b>Colza</b> had desired {{to know whether}} she had quarrelled with all the Balls. In her open and somewhat indignant speech in the drawing-room at the Cedars, she had declared before Mr Maguire, in her aunt's presence, that she was engaged to marry her cousin, John Ball. Mr Maguire had now enlisted Miss <b>Colza</b> in his service, and had told Miss <b>Colza</b> what had occurred. But still Miss Mackenzie did not thoroughly understand the matter. Why, she asked herself, should Mr Maguire trouble himself further, now that {{he knew that she}} had no fortune? But, in truth, it was not so easy to satisfy Mr Maguire on that point, as it was to satisfy Miss Mackenzie herself. He believed that the relatives of his lady-love were robbing her, or that they were, at any rate, taking advantage of her weakness. If it might be given to him to rescue her and her fortune from them, then, in such case as that, surely he would get his reward. The reader will therefore understand why Miss <b>Colza</b> was anxious to know whether Miss Mackenzie had quarrelled with all the Balls.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I {{ought not}} {{to call it a}} party, for there are only one or two coming. There's Dr Slumpy and his wife; I don't know whether you ever met Dr Slumpy. He has {{attended}} us for ever so long; and there is Miss <b>Colza,</b> a great friend of mine. Mademoiselle <b>Colza</b> I ought to call her, because her father was a Portuguese. Only as she never saw him, we call her Miss. And there's Mr Rubb,--Samuel Rubb, junior. I think you met him at Littlebath." ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Mackenzie {{declined}} to discuss the subject, and assured Mrs Tom that she only recommended the banishment of Miss <b>Colza</b> because of her apparent unwillingness to pay.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Mackenzie {{seemed to}} be having [...] "a good time" [...] with her {{neighbour}} Samuel Rubb, junior, and Miss <b>Colza,</b> who was a woman of courage, could not see that and not make an effort. It cannot be told here what passages there had been between Mr Rubb and Miss <b>Colza.</b> That there had absolutely been passages I beg the reader to understand. [...] "Mr Rubb," [...] she said, stretching across the table, [...] "do you remember when, in this very room, we met Mr and Mrs Talbot Green?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then came in Mr Rubb, and Miss <b>Colza</b> at once {{turned her}} {{attention}} to him. But Mr Rubb shook Miss <b>Colza</b> off almost unceremoniously, and seated himself by Miss Mackenzie. Immediately afterwards arrived the doctor and his wife. The doctor was a very silent man, and as Tom Mackenzie himself was not given to much talking, it was well that Miss <b>Colza</b> should be there. Mrs Slumpy could take her share in conversation with an effort, when duly assisted; but she could not lead the van, and required more sprightly aid than her host was qualified to give her. Then there was a whisper between Tom and Mrs Tom and the bell was rung, and the dinner was ordered. Seven had been the time named, and a quarter past seven saw the guests assembled in the drawing-room. A very dignified person in white cotton gloves had announced the names, and the same dignified person had taken the order for dinner. The dignified person had then retreated downstairs slowly, and what was taking place for the next half-hour poor Mrs Mackenzie, in the agony of her mind, could not surmise. She longed to go and see, but did not dare. Even for Dr Slumpy, or even for his wife, had they been alone with her she would not have cared much. Miss <b>Colza</b> she could have treated with perfect indifference--could even have taken her down into the kitchen with her. Rubb, her own junior partner, was nothing, and Miss Mackenzie was simply her sister-in-law. But together they made a party. Moreover she had on her best and stiffest silk gown, and so armed she could not have been effective in the kitchen. And so came a silence for some minutes, in spite of the efforts of Miss <b>Colza.</b> At last the hostess plucked up her courage to make a little effort.|$|E
60|$|During {{this period}} {{she saw her}} {{sister-in-law}} once or twice, who on those occasions came down to Arundel Street. She herself would not go to Gower Street, {{because of the presence}} of Miss <b>Colza.</b> Miss <b>Colza</b> still continued to live there, and still continued very much in arrear in her contributions to the household fund. Mrs Mackenzie did not turn her out, because she would,--so she said,--in such case get nothing. Mrs Tom was by this time quite convinced that the property would, either justly or unjustly, go into the hands of John Ball, and she was therefore less anxious to make any sacrifice to please her sister-in-law.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Ball is {{the lady}} of Sir John Ball, Baronet," [...] said Miss <b>Colza,</b> whose good nature made her desirous of {{standing}} up for the honour of the family with which she was, for the time, domesticated.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm come in here," [...] said Mrs Tom, again apologising, [...] "because the {{children}} had {{to come out of}} the room behind the drawing-room. Miss <b>Colza</b> is staying with us, and she and Mary Jane have your room." ...|$|E
60|$|It may be {{presumed that}} the flirting {{had not gone}} to any perilous extent, as there were three or four {{children}} present. Nevertheless Miss <b>Colza</b> and Mr Rubb were somewhat disconcerted, and expressed their surprise at seeing Miss Mackenzie.|$|E
60|$|Mr Rubb at {{this time}} had settled down into so {{pleasant}} a little series of whispers with his neighbour, that Miss <b>Colza</b> resolved once more to exert herself, not with the praiseworthy desire of assisting her friend Mrs Mackenzie, but with malice prepense in reference to Miss Mackenzie.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thought {{there was}} {{something}} wrong with the blooming thing," [...] said the Sergeant, [...] "but couldn't turn it up, as it hasn't got a screw, without which these old-fashioned <b>colza</b> oils never were no good. Hullo! Doctor, there goes yours," [...] and as he spoke, go it did.|$|E
60|$|The older, her bezique {{cards and}} counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositious wealth, her lapses of {{responsiveness}} and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of <b>colza</b> oil before {{the statue of}} the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is a mean, false, greedy man," [...] she said, {{and then}} paused a moment; [...] "and {{he has been}} the cause of my ruin." [...] She would not, however, explain what she meant by this, and left the house, without going back to the room in which Miss <b>Colza</b> was sitting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I do," [...] said Miss <b>Colza.</b> [...] "But Mrs Talbot Green {{was not at}} all {{the person}} that Mr Rubb has described; we all thought her very nice-looking. Mr Rubb, do you {{remember}} how you would go on talking to her, till Mr Talbot Green did not like it at all?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then Miss <b>Colza</b> ceased, having {{finished}} that effort. But {{she made}} others {{from time to}} time as long as they remained in the dining-room, and by no means gave up the battle. There are women who can fight such battles when they have not an inch of ground on which to stand.|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} was Sunday, and the church bells had little rest; indeed, I do not think I {{remember}} anywhere else so great a choice of services as were here offered to the devout. And while the bells made merry in the sunshine, all the world with his dog was out shooting among the beets and <b>colza.</b>|$|E
60|$|Miss Mackenzie, {{having some}} kindly feeling towards Mr Rubb, would have {{preferred}} to hear that Miss <b>Colza</b> was likely to become Mrs Maguire. During these visits, Mrs Tom got more than one five-pound note from her sister-in-law, pleading the difficulty she had in procuring breakfast for lodgers without any money for the baker. Margaret protested against these encroachments, but, still, the money would be forthcoming.|$|E
60|$|The {{conversation}} was desired for purposes appertaining {{solely to the}} convenience of the widow. She wanted some money, and then, with tears in her eyes, she demanded {{to know what was}} to be done. Miss <b>Colza</b> paid her eighteen shillings a week for board and lodging, and that was now two weeks in arrear; and one bedroom was let to a young man employed in the oilcloth factory, at seven shillings a week.|$|E
60|$|Late in November {{yet another}} gentleman {{came to see}} her, but when he came she was {{unfortunately}} out. She had gone {{up to the house}} in Gower Street, and had there been so cross-questioned by the indefatigable Miss <b>Colza</b> that she had felt herself compelled to tell her sister-in-law that she could not again come there as long as Miss <b>Colza</b> was one of the family. It was manifest to her that these questions had been put on behalf of Mr Maguire, and she had therefore felt more indignant than she would have been had they originated in the impertinent curiosity of the woman herself. She also informed Mrs Mackenzie that, in obedience to instructions from Mr Slow, she intended to postpone her purpose with reference to the hospital till some time early in the next year. Mr Slow had sent a clerk to her to explain that till that time such amicable arrangement as that to which he looked forward to make could not be completed. On her return from this visit to Gower Street she found the card,--simply the card,--of her cousin, John Ball.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Mackenzie {{is making}} a long visit at the Cedars," [...] said Miss <b>Colza,</b> [...] "that is all we know at present. I am told the Balls are very nice people, but perhaps a little worldly-minded; that's to be expected, however, from people who live out of the west-end from London. I live in Finsbury Square, or at least, I did before I came here, and I ain't a bit ashamed to own it. But of course the west-end is the nicest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all; and I {{might as}} well say {{how it will be}} now. Mr Rubb will take you down to dinner. Tom will take Mrs Slumpy, and the doctor will take me. Young Tom,"--Young Tom was her son, who was now {{beginning}} his career at Rubb and Mackenzie's,--"Young Tom will take Miss <b>Colza,</b> and Mary Jane and Susanna will come down by themselves. We might have managed twelve, and Tom did think of asking Mr Handcock and one of the other clerks, but he did not know whether you would have liked it." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was found}} {{at the bottom of}} a {{detached}} shaft which had been sunk and abandoned at the commencement of the work for the new electric railway near Baker Street Station. His arm and leg and two ribs were broken. The shaft is protected by a hoarding nearly 20 feet high, and over this, incredible as it seems, Mr. Bessel, a stout, middle-aged gentleman, must have scrambled in order to fall down the shaft. He was saturated in <b>colza</b> oil, and the smashed tin lay beside him, but luckily the flame had been extinguished by his fall. And his madness had passed from him altogether. But he was, of course, terribly enfeebled, and at the sight of his rescuers he gave way to hysterical weeping.|$|E
60|$|But after {{a quarter}} to two he had vanished. Up to that hour {{witnesses}} were multitudinous. Dozens of people had seen him, fled from him or pursued him, and then things suddenly came to an end. At {{a quarter to}} two he had been seen running down the Euston Road towards Baker Street, flourishing a can of burning <b>colza</b> oil and jerking splashes of flame therefrom at {{the windows of the}} houses he passed. But none of the policemen on Euston Road beyond the Waxwork Exhibition, nor any of those in the side streets down which he must have passed had he left the Euston Road, had seen anything of him. Abruptly he disappeared. Nothing of his subsequent doings came to light in spite of the keenest inquiry.|$|E
60|$|But some further {{annoyance}} he {{did give}} to Griselda. He managed to induce Mrs Tom Mackenzie {{to take him}} in as a lodger in Gower Street, and Margaret very nearly ran into his way in her anxiety to befriend her sister-in-law. Luckily she heard from Mr Rubb {{that he was there}} on the very day on which she had intended to visit Gower Street. Poor Mrs Mackenzie got the worst of it; for of course Mr Maguire did not pay for his lodgings. But he did marry Miss <b>Colza,</b> and in some way got himself instituted to a chapel at Islington. There we will leave him, not trusting much in his connubial bliss, but faintly hoping that his teaching may be favourable to the faith and morals of his new flock.|$|E
