5|$|Following {{the release}} of Extra Mile, a band from Kentucky {{threatened}} to sue Shenandoah {{over the use of}} the name Shenandoah. After a financial settlement was made with the Kentucky band, two other bands filed lawsuits over Shenandoah's name. The lawsuits depleted the money earned by the band on the road, which led to the band asking the label and their production company to all pay one-third of their legal costs. The production company refused, and Shenandoah was forced to filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early 1991 after paying more than 2 million dollars on <b>court</b> <b>settlements</b> and legal fees. Although the lawsuits allowed Shenandoah to keep its name, the bankruptcy filing terminated the contract with Columbia after a 1992 Greatest Hits package. The production company's officials then filed a lawsuit against the band, claiming that it had tried to void its agreement with them. After Shenandoah's departure, there were no other bands on Columbia's Nashville division; as a result, producer Larry Strickland assembled three musicians to create a new band called Matthews, Wright & King in an attempt to keep a commercially successful band on the label.|$|E
2500|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Nez Perce War led to additional problems for the governor. [...] Lacking legal basis for creation of a militia, Brayman was forced to rely upon General Oliver O. Howard's response to the hostilities. [...] This caused anger among residents of the northern counties who lacked the means to defend themselves against the hostile tribe. [...] Additional problems came for the governor following a visit to Rocky Bar courthouse in Alturas County. [...] The court faced a large backlog of cases involving mining disputes, and the delays thus caused were affecting the local economy. [...] Brayman suggested involved parties come to out of <b>court</b> <b>settlements</b> {{as a means of}} speeding resolution. [...] Chief Justice Madison Hollister, presiding justice and member of the Boise Ring, took this suggestion as a personal affront. [...] The Ring in turn used the incident as an excuse to seek Brayman's disbarment. [...] Brayman prevailed during the disbarment hearing but was publicly humiliated in the process.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the author offers {{analysis}} of rules regulating the challenging of a <b>court</b> <b>settlement</b> {{in light of}} the evolution and legal nature of the <b>court</b> <b>settlement</b> in domestic and comparative law (Austrian, German, and Hungarian laws). The method of the procedural challenge depended on the understanding whether the settlement is an agreement (contract) between parties before the court or it is a decision of the court (on acceptance or rejection of the proposal of the parties to reach a settlement). In the earlier instance the method of challenge is by filing of an action, and in the latter instance it represents a form of a legal remedy, most often extraordinary legal remedy - request for repetition of a trial, against final and binding decision of the court by which the settlement was either accepted or rejected. Theoretical dilemma about the legal nature of the <b>court</b> <b>settlement,</b> had an effect on normative regulations, as well as on court practice. In the Serbian law, this dilemma was resolved by enactment of the Civil Procedure Code which explicitly regulates that <b>court</b> <b>settlement</b> is challenged by an action before the court. As a result of this, the idea of a <b>court</b> <b>settlement,</b> as a form of an agreement, prevailed in the legal system. However, considerable procedural effects of the <b>court</b> <b>settlement</b> cannot be ignored. The principal procedural effect is that the litigation is terminated. Further, the <b>court</b> <b>settlement</b> represents a form of an executive title...|$|R
