40|$|The Health Service Executive (HSE) Palliative Care Programme Briefing Document (2012) {{identified}} {{the development of}} a Palliative Care <b>Competence</b> <b>Framework</b> as a key objective for the coming year. The Health Service Executive’s Palliative Care Programme convened a Project Steering Group to support, guide and oversee the development of the Palliative Care <b>Competence</b> <b>Framework.</b> The steering group comprises members from the Health Service Executive (HSE), All Ireland Institute of Hospice and Palliative Care (AIIHPC), the Irish Association for Palliative Care (IAPC) and the Irish Hospice Foundation (IHF). The purpose of this project was to develop a Palliative Care <b>Competence</b> <b>Framework</b> for health and social care professionals working in various health care settings. The framework is intended to provide for core competences in palliative care whilst also detailing individual competences for each health and social care discipline. It is envisioned that the framework will inform academic curricula and professional development programs, and so will enhance the care of people with a life-limiting condition, fostering greater inter-professional and inter-organizational collaboration in palliative care provision. The Palliative Care <b>Competence</b> <b>Framework</b> reflects a move to standardisation of undergraduate and postgraduate education in Europe and how this relates to the development of competence using the Tuning Approach. The Tuning Approach provides a guide for attainment of knowledge, skills and attributes for practice in the health and social care professions. The Palliative Care <b>Competence</b> <b>Framework</b> was developed using the Tuning Approach which provided flexibility and autonomy to develop both core and discipline specific competences for generalist and specialist palliative care. The outcome is a clear framework for evidence-based, safe and effective palliative care for generalist and specialist practitioners irrespective of place of practice...|$|E

40|$|How has {{the role}} of teacher <b>competence</b> <b>frameworks</b> been defined {{recently}} in educational debates and policy in Europe and globally?Why does it have {{pride of place in}} international policy discourse?What are its links with other key education policy areas? What are the key aspects and issues of teacher competences and professional standards according to research? Is there a consensus on defining key features of teacher competences and is this possible beyond diverse cultures of education and schooling? What common ground can be found across wide international diversity of policy practices? And how can this translate into an educational reform that is able to make a difference — beyond paying lip service to official policy discourse?Which key issues and achievements in this policy field are highlighted by examples from national contexts in Europe? Can any patterns be traced and lessons learnt that can be of interest for policy experts, stakeholders and decision makers? This article begins by outlining the European and global policy scenario, providing several reasons for mainstream competence-informed perspectives in education policies worldwide and their central role for the teaching profession. Research-informed views on the teacher competence concept strive to find common ground beyond different cultural traditions, defining key knowledge, skills and attitudes that can be required of teachers, {{the role of}} professional standards, and basic characteristics of teacher expertise. There follows an analysis of policy implications at the crucial stage of implementing teacher <b>competence</b> <b>frameworks</b> at national levels — the shift from policy discourse to policy practice.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a study of the requirements for developing a Digital <b>Competence</b> <b>Framework</b> {{in the context of a}} digital marketplace in the EU. Consumer digital competence is defined as the competence consumers need to function actively, safely and assertively in the digital marketplace. This framework will define the skills, knowledge and attitudes that consumers need to navigate the complex digital environment. The research project to create the Digital <b>Competence</b> <b>Framework</b> for Consumers is a joint action of DG Justice and Consumers (JUST), and the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the Commission’s science and knowledge service. The work, carried out between 2015 - 2016, aimed to achieve the goals set out by the European Commission in its two recent Communications: “A New Skills Agenda For Europe - Working together to strengthen human capital, employability and competitiveness” (European Commission, 2016) and “A Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe” (European Commission, 2015). Both these Communications focus on the importance of citizens’ digital skills and their capacity to participate more deeply in our digital society and economy. The study presented in this report is designed to elicit user requirements in order to support the development of the Digital <b>Competence</b> <b>Framework</b> for Consumers. The study was commissioned by the Joint Research Centre and it is a result of collaborative work between the authors of the report. Further consultation on requirements was carried out with DG JUST in which experts on various topics gave their input and contributed to the text. The literature and the hot-button issues described in this report reflect the state-of-play in 2015, when the study was carried out. The methodology used to clarify the requirements for a consumer digital <b>competence</b> <b>framework</b> had four main steps. First, a ‘broad-but-shallow’ look into important emerging issues in the field of online shopping and advertisement was taken. In this phase of the study, a number of European Commission working documents on the issue were reviewed. The focus was also on current relevant literature, both academic and grey literature. Second, the existing terms and major work in consumer competence was reviewed and links were made to behavioural insights. It emerged that lack of digital competence can make consumers vulnerable in today’s complex digital environment. Third, part of the work consisted of testing the suitability of the existing Digital <b>Competence</b> <b>Framework</b> for Citizens (DigComp) in an expert workshop to further prompt requirements for the new framework. Lastly, to finalise the process of requirement gathering, a gap analysis was conducted on a number of prominent sources of educational material for consumer competence. The study found that the DigComp framework was a suitable starting point and confirms that it could be adapted to the new context of the digital marketplace. However, the analysis also showed that not all competencies are covered by the existing framework, in particular with regards to emerging digital trends and issues outlined. The final product of the project, the Digital <b>Competence</b> <b>Framework</b> for Consumers, is described in a JRC Science for Policy publication by Brecko & Ferrari (2016).
