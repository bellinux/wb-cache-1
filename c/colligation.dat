60|$|There is, however, between <b>Colligation</b> and Induction, a real correlation, {{which it}} is {{important}} to conceive correctly. <b>Colligation</b> is not always induction; but induction is always <b>colligation.</b> The assertion that the planets move in ellipses, was but a mode of representing observed facts; it was but a colligation; while the assertion that they are drawn, or tend, toward the sun, was the statement of a new fact, inferred by induction. But the induction, once made, accomplishes the purposes of <b>colligation</b> likewise. It brings the same facts, which Kepler had connected by his conception of an ellipse, under the additional conception of bodies acted upon by a central force, and serves, therefore, as a new bond of connection for those facts; a new principle for their classification.|$|E

40|$|Data-Driven Learning (DDL) is the pedagogic {{application}} of corpus linguistics in classrooms. This study examines {{the impact of}} guided DDL (paper-based and online searching) on law undergraduates’ colligational competence, i. e. <b>colligations</b> of prepositions, {{one of the most}} essential lexico-grammatical components in legal texts. Firth’s (1957 b) contextual theory of meaning and Vygotsky’s scaffolding theory (1978) become the premises of this study. Forty semester three law undergraduates in the Faculty of Law and International Relations (FLAIR), UniSZA, Malaysia took part in the seven-week experimental study. Data were collected from the pretest and posttest and analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test to find differences between the two group scores. A post- experimental interview was later conducted with 10 respondents in the experimental group to gain their perceptions of the DDL approach. The findings show that the students in the DDL group performed significantly better than the students in the comparison group in the knowledge of the form and meaning of <b>colligations</b> of prepositions, but not in the production. The results of the study indicate that multiple exposures to DDL during the seven-week experimental course impacted the respondents’ receptive knowledge but not the production (single-sentence) of <b>colligations</b> of prepositions. Meanwhile, the results from the post-course interview show {{that the majority of the}} 20 respondents had positive attitudes towards DDL. It was concluded that explicit exposure to DDL may affect greatly the knowledge of <b>colligations</b> of prepositions among ESP or law students. However, before the input becomes output (spoken or written production), it requires a lot of time and practice. The learners’ positive attitudes towards DDL can be explained in terms of inductive and motivating approach that DDL brings to classrooms. This study recommends explicit teaching of <b>colligations</b> of prepositions via paper-based and guided DDL online as opposed to the conventional approach and ‘hard DDL’ (independent online searching) to enhance law students’ colligational competence...|$|R

The {{descriptive}} operation {{which enables}} {{a number of}} details to {{be summed up in}} a single proposition, Dr. Whewell, by an aptly chosen expression, has termed the <b>Colligation</b> of Facts. In most of his observations concerning that mental process I fully agree, and would gladly transfer all that portion of his book into my own pages. I only think him mistaken in setting up this kind of operation, which according to the old and received meaning of the term, is not induction at all, as the type of induction generally; and laying down, throughout his work, as principles of induction, the principles of mere <b>colligation.</b>|$|E
60|$|How {{far this}} {{tentative}} method, so indispensable {{as a means}} to the <b>colligation</b> of facts for purposes of description, admits of application to Induction itself, and what functions belong to it in that department, will be considered in the chapter of the present Book which relates to Hypotheses. On the present occasion we have chiefly to distinguish this process of <b>Colligation</b> from Induction properly so called; and that the distinction may be made clearer, it is well to advert to a curious and interesting remark, which is as strikingly true of the former operation, as it appears to me unequivocally false of the latter.|$|E
60|$|In every way, therefore, it {{is evident}} that to explain {{induction}} as the <b>colligation</b> of facts by means of appropriate conceptions, that is, conceptions which will really express them, is to confound mere description of the observed facts with inference from those facts, and ascribe to the latter what is a characteristic property of the former.|$|E

60|$|Dr. Whewell’s remark, therefore, is philosophically correct. Successive {{expressions}} for the <b>colligation</b> of observed facts, or, {{in other}} words, successive descriptions of a phenomenon as a whole, {{which has been}} observed only in parts, may, though conflicting, be all correct {{as far as they}} go. But it would surely be absurd to assert this of conflicting inductions.|$|E
60|$|What more may usefully be said on {{the subject}} of <b>Colligation,</b> or of the {{correlative}} expression invented by Dr. Whewell, the Explication of Conceptions, and generally {{on the subject of}} ideas and mental representations as connected with the study of facts, will find a more appropriate place in the Fourth Book, on the Operations Subsidiary to Induction: to which I must refer the reader for the removal of any difficulty which the present discussion may have left.|$|E
60|$|The <b>Colligation</b> of Facts, therefore, {{by means}} of hypotheses, or, as Dr. Whewell prefers to say, {{by means of}} Conceptions, instead of being, as he supposes, Induction itself, takes its proper place among {{operations}} subsidiary to Induction. All Induction supposes that we have previously compared the requisite number of individual instances, and ascertained in what circumstances they agree. The <b>Colligation</b> of Facts is no other than this preliminary operation. When Kepler, after vainly endeavoring to connect the observed places of a planet by various hypotheses of circular motion, at last tried the hypotheses of an ellipse and found it answer to the phenomena; what he really attempted, first unsuccessfully and at last successfully, was to discover the circumstance {{in which all the}} observed positions of the planet agreed. And when he in like manner connected another set of observed facts, the periodic times of the different planets, by the proposition that the squares of the times are proportional to the cubes of the distances, what he did was simply to ascertain the property in which the periodic times of all the different planets agreed.|$|E

60|$|The mental {{operation}} which {{extracts from}} a number of detached observations certain general characters in which the observed phenomena resemble one another, or resemble other known facts, is what Bacon, Locke, and most subsequent metaphysicians, have understood by the word Abstraction. A general expression obtained by abstraction, connecting known facts by means of common characters, but without concluding from them to unknown, may, I think, with strict logical correctness, be termed a Description; nor do I know in what other way things can ever be described. My position, however, does not depend on the employment of that particular word; I am quite content to use Dr. Whewell’s term <b>Colligation,</b> or the more general phrases, “mode of representing, or of expressing, phenomena:” provided it be clearly seen that the process is not Induction, but something radically different.|$|E
60|$|Further, the {{descriptions}} which are improperly confounded with induction, are nevertheless a necessary preparation for induction; no less necessary than correct {{observation of the}} facts themselves. Without the previous <b>colligation</b> of detached observations by means of one general conception, we could never have obtained any basis for an induction, except {{in the case of}} phenomena of very limited compass. We should not be able to affirm any predicates at all, of a subject incapable of being observed otherwise than piecemeal: much less could we extend those predicates by induction to other similar subjects. Induction, therefore, always presupposes, not only that the necessary observations are made with the necessary accuracy, but also that the results of these observations are, so far as practicable, connected together by general descriptions, enabling the mind to represent to itself as wholes whatever phenomena are capable of being so represented.|$|E
60|$|Since, therefore, {{all that}} is true and to the purpose in Dr. Whewell’s {{doctrine}} of Conceptions might be fully expressed by the more familiar term Hypothesis; and since his <b>Colligation</b> of Facts by means of appropriate Conceptions, is but the ordinary process of finding by a comparison of phenomena, in what consists their agreement or resemblance; I would willingly have confined myself to those better understood expressions, and persevered to the end in the same abstinence which I have hitherto observed from ideological discussions; considering the mechanism of our thoughts to be a topic distinct from and irrelevant to the principles and rules by which the trustworthiness {{of the results of}} thinking is to be estimated. Since, however, a work of such high pretensions, and, it must also be said, of so much real merit, has rested the whole theory of Induction upon such ideological considerations, it seems necessary for others who follow to claim for themselves and their doctrines whatever position may properly belong to them on the same metaphysical ground. And this is the object of the succeeding chapter.|$|E

60|$|The conceptions, then, {{which we}} employ for the <b>colligation</b> and methodization of facts, do not develop {{themselves}} from within, but are impressed upon the mind from without; {{they are never}} obtained otherwise than by way of comparison and abstraction, and, in {{the most important and}} the most numerous cases, are evolved by abstraction from the very phenomena which it is their office to colligate. I am far, however, from wishing to imply that it is not often a very difficult thing to perform this process of abstraction well, or that the success of an inductive operation does not, in many cases, principally depend on the skill with which we perform it. Bacon was quite justified in designating as one of the principal obstacles to good induction, general conceptions wrongly formed, “notiones temerè à rebus abstractæ;” to which Dr. Whewell adds, that not only does bad abstraction make bad induction, but that, in order to perform induction well, we must have abstracted well; our general conceptions must be “clear” and “appropriate” to the matter in hand.|$|E
60|$|Every great advance which marks an epoch in the {{progress}} of science, has consisted in a step made toward the solution of this problem. Even a simple <b>colligation</b> of inductions already made, without any fresh extension of the inductive inference, is already an advance in that direction. When Kepler expressed the regularity which exists in the observed motions of the heavenly bodies, by the three general propositions called his laws, he, in so doing, pointed out three simple suppositions which, instead of a much greater number, would suffice to construct the whole scheme of the heavenly motions, {{so far as it}} was known up to that time. A similar and still greater step was made when these laws, which at first {{did not seem to be}} included in any more general truths, were discovered to be cases of the three laws of motion, as obtaining among bodies which mutually tend toward one another with a certain force, and have had a certain instantaneous impulse originally impressed upon them. After this great discovery, Kepler’s three propositions, though still called laws, would hardly, by any person accustomed to use language with precision, be termed laws of nature: that phrase would be reserved for the simpler and more general laws into which Newton is said to have resolved them.|$|E
6000|$|In {{different}} stages of the progress of knowledge, philosophers have employed, for the <b>colligation</b> of the same order of facts, different conceptions. The early rude observations of the heavenly bodies, in which minute precision was neither attained nor sought, presented nothing inconsistent with {{the representation of the}} path of a planet as an exact circle, having the earth for its centre. As observations increased in accuracy, facts were disclosed which were not reconcilable with this simple supposition: for the <b>colligation</b> of those additional facts, the supposition was varied; and varied again and again as facts became more numerous and precise. The earth was removed from the centre to some other point within the circle; the planet was supposed to revolve in a smaller circle called an epicycle, round an imaginary point which revolved in a circle round the earth: in proportion as observation elicited fresh facts contradictory to these representations, other epicycles and other eccentrics were added, producing additional complication; until at last Kepler swept all these circles away, and substituted the conception of an exact ellipse. Even this is found not to represent with complete correctness the accurate observations of the present day, which disclose many slight deviations from an orbit exactly elliptical. Now Dr. Whewell has remarked that these successive general expressions, though apparently so conflicting, were all correct: they all answered the purpose of colligation; they all enabled the mind to represent to itself with facility, and by a simultaneous glance, the whole body of facts at the time ascertained: each in its turn served as a correct description of the phenomena, so far as the senses had up to that time taken cognizance of them. If a necessity afterward arose for discarding one of these general descriptions of the planet’s orbit, and framing a different imaginary line, by which to express the series of observed positions, it was because a number of new facts had now been added, which it was necessary to combine with the old facts into one general description. But this did not affect the correctness of the former expression, considered as a general statement of the only facts which it was intended to represent. And so true is this, that, as is well remarked by M. Comte, these ancient generalizations, even the rudest and most imperfect of them, that of uniform movement in a circle, are so far from being entirely false, that they are even now habitually employed by astronomers when only a rough approximation to correctness is required. “L’astronomie moderne, en détruisant sans retour les hypothèses primitives, envisagées comme lois réelles du monde, a soigneusement maintenu leur valeur positive et permanente, la propriété de représenter commodément les phénomènes quand il s’agit d’une première ébauche. Nos ressources à cet égard sont même bien plus étendues, précisément à cause que nous ne nous faisons aucune illusion sur la réalité des hypothèses; ce qui nous permet d’employer sans scrupule, en chaque cas, celle que nous jugeons la plus avantageuse.”(104) ...|$|E

60|$|In the {{progress}} of geological speculation, the same laws of thought are displayed. We have dogmas that were more than half false, passing current for a time as universal truths. We have evidence collected in proof of these dogmas; by and by a <b>colligation</b> of facts in antagonism with them; and eventually a consequent modification. In conformity with this improved hypothesis, {{we have a better}} classification of facts; a greater power of arranging and interpreting the new facts now rapidly gathered together; and further resulting corrections of hypothesis. Being, as we are at present, {{in the midst of this}} process, it is not possible to give an adequate account of the development of geological science as thus regarded: the earlier stages are alone known to us. Not only, however, is it interesting to observe how the more advanced views now received respecting the Earth's history, have been evolved out of the crude views which preceded them; but we shall find it extremely instructive to observe this. We shall see how greatly the old ideas still sway both the general mind and the minds of geologists themselves. We shall see how the kind of evidence that has in part abolished these old ideas, is still daily accumulating, and threatens to make other like revolutions. In brief, we shall see whereabouts we are in the elaboration of a true theory of the Earth; and, seeing our whereabouts, shall be the better able to judge, among various conflicting opinions, which best conform to the ascertained direction of geological discovery.|$|E
6000|$|... § 4. We observed, in {{the second}} chapter, that the {{proposition}} “the earth moves in an ellipse,” {{so far as it}} only serves for the <b>colligation</b> or connecting together of actual observations (that is, as it only affirms that the observed positions of the earth may be correctly represented by as many points in the circumference of an imaginary ellipse), is not an induction, but a description: it is an induction, only when it affirms that the intermediate positions, of which there has been no direct observation, would be found to correspond to the remaining points of the same elliptic circumference. Now, though this real induction is one thing, and the description another, we are in a very different condition for making the induction before we have obtained the description, and after it. For inasmuch as the description, like all other descriptions, contains the assertion of a resemblance between the phenomenon described and something else; in pointing out something which the series of observed places of a planet resembles, it points out something in which the several places themselves agree. If the series of places correspond to as many points of an ellipse, the places themselves agree in being situated in that ellipse. We have, therefore, by the same process which gave us the description, obtained the requisites for an induction by the Method of Agreement. The successive observed places of the earth being considered as effects, and its motion as the cause which produces them, we find that those effects, that is, those places, agree in the circumstance of being in an ellipse. We conclude that the remaining effects, the places which have not been observed, agree in the same circumstance, and that the law of the motion of the earth is motion in an ellipse.|$|E
6000|$|... § 2. But it {{does not}} {{therefore}} follow that these general conceptions must have existed in the mind previously to the comparison. It is not a law of our intellect, that in comparing things {{with each other and}} taking note of their agreement we merely recognize as realized in the outward world something that we already had in our minds. The conception originally found its way to us as the result of such a comparison. It was obtained (in metaphysical phrase) by abstraction from individual things. These things may be things which we perceived or thought of on former occasions, but they may also be the things which we are perceiving or thinking of on the very occasion. When Kepler compared the observed places of the planet Mars, and found that they agreed in being points of an elliptic circumference, he applied a general conception which was already in his mind, having been derived from his former experience. But this is by no means universally the case. When we compare several objects and find them to agree in being white, or when we compare the various species of ruminating animals and find them to agree in being cloven-footed, we have just as much a general conception in our minds as Kepler had in his: we have the conception of “a white thing,” or the conception of “a cloven-footed animal.” But no one supposes that we necessarily bring these conceptions with us, and superinduce them (to adopt Dr. Whewell’s expression) upon the facts: because in these simple cases every body sees that the very act of comparison which ends in our connecting the facts by means of the conception, may be the source from which we derive the conception itself. If we had never seen any white object or had never seen any cloven-footed animal before, we should {{at the same time and}} by the same mental act acquire the idea, and employ it for the <b>colligation</b> of the observed phenomena. Kepler, on the contrary, really had to bring the idea with him, and superinduce it upon the facts; he could not evolve it out of them: if he had not already had the idea, he would not have been able to acquire it by a comparison of the planet’s positions. But this inability was a mere accident; the idea of an ellipse could have been acquired from the paths of the planets as effectually as from any thing else, if the paths had not happened to be invisible. If the planet had left a visible track, and we had been so placed that we could see it at the proper angle, we might have abstracted our original idea of an ellipse from the planetary orbit. Indeed, every conception which can be made the instrument for connecting a set of facts, might have been originally evolved from those very facts. The conception is a conception of something; and that which it is a conception of, is really in the facts, and might, under some supposable circumstances, or by some supposable extension of the faculties which we actually possess, have been detected in them. And not only is this always in itself possible, but it actually happens in almost all cases in which the obtaining of the right conception is a matter of any considerable difficulty. For if there be no new conception required; if one of those already familiar to mankind will serve the purpose, the accident of being the first to whom the right one occurs, may happen to almost any body; at least in the case of a set of phenomena which the whole scientific world are engaged in attempting to connect. The honor, in Kepler’s case, was that of the accurate, patient, and toilsome calculations by which he compared the results that followed from his different guesses, with the observations of Tycho Brahe; but the merit was very small of guessing an ellipse; the only wonder is that men had not guessed it before, nor could they have failed to do so if there had not existed an obstinate a priori prejudice that the heavenly bodies must move, if not in a circle, in some combination of circles.|$|E
