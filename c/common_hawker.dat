50|$|In Singapore, pig's organ soup is a <b>common</b> {{feature of}} <b>hawker</b> centres. Due to Singapore's {{proximity}} and ethnic makeup, {{many of the}} items written for Indonesia and Malaysia above are also found in Singapore.|$|R
50|$|The {{cries of}} hawkers and costermongers could once {{be heard in}} every city in the world, though their use {{as a basis for}} song is {{particularly}} notable in South America and the Caribbean. In Cuba, ethnologist, Miguel Barnet, noted that cross-fertilization was <b>common</b> as <b>hawkers</b> also often based their pregones on rural tunes or popular genres such as son and guaracha. The Cuban music historian, Cristóbal Díaz Ayala, has compiled a list of nearly five hundred examples of popular tunes based on hawker songs ‒ most from Cuba, but also from other Latin American countries such as Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Panama, Venezuela, Peru, Argentina, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico.|$|R
50|$|Koseze Pond is {{now used}} as a {{recreation}} area by local residents. In the summer it is used for racing radio-controlled model boats and fishing. Swimming is prohibited due to the poor quality of the water, which is also contaminated by cyanobacteria. In the winter it is used for skating. Koseze Pond is a natural habitat for the edible frog, migrant <b>hawker,</b> <b>common</b> bulrush, and common reed.|$|R
50|$|The ponds {{among the}} dunes {{are home to}} many dragonflies {{including}} the <b>common</b> <b>hawker</b> - which is rare in Norfolk.|$|E
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>hawker,</b> moorland hawker or sedge darner (Aeshna juncea) {{is one of}} {{the larger}} species of hawker dragonflies. It is native to Palearctic (from Ireland to Japan) and {{northern}} North America. The flight period is from June to early October.|$|E
50|$|Around 90 {{species of}} bird have been {{recorded}} as breeding on the reserve, and six species of bat, including the pipistrelle and brown long-eared bat. Butterfly species include purple hairstreaks, commas and peacocks. Dragonflies include golden ringed, <b>common</b> <b>hawker</b> and four spotted chaser.|$|E
60|$|I {{should not}} have given the publick or myself the trouble of this vindication, if my name had not been made use of by several persons, to whom I never lent it; one of which, a few days ago, was pleased to father on me a new sett of predictions. But I think those are things too serious to be trifled with. It grieved me to the heart, when I saw my labours, which had cost me so much thought and watching, bawl'd about by <b>common</b> <b>hawkers,</b> which I only {{intended}} for the weighty consideration of the gravest persons. This prejudiced the world so much at first, that several of my friends had the assurance to ask me whether I were in jest? To which I only answered coldly, that the event would shew. But it is the talent of our age and nation, to turn things of the greatest importance into ridicule. When {{the end of the}} year had verified all my predictions, out comes Mr. Partridge's almanack, disputing the point of his death; so that I am employed, like the general who was forced to kill his enemies twice over, whom a necromancer had raised to life. If Mr. Partridge has practised the same experiment upon himself, and be again alive, long may he continue so; that does not in the least contradict my veracity: But I think I have clearly proved, by invincible demonstration, that he died at farthest within half an hour of the time I foretold, and not four hours sooner, as the above-mentioned author, in his letter to a lord, hath maliciously suggested, with design to blast my credit, by charging me with so gross a mistake.|$|R

Species include the broad-bodied chaser (Libellula depressa), <b>common</b> <b>hawker</b> (Aeshna juncea), emperor (Anax imperator) and ruddy darter (Sympetrum sanguineum), {{as well as the}} first Cheshire {{sighting}} of the migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta).|$|E
50|$|The {{relatively}} small area of open water {{is dominated by}} floating pondweeds (Potamogeton sps), and has some water lilies Nuphar lutea. The <b>Common</b> <b>Hawker</b> or Sedge Darner (Aeshna juncea) breeds at the site. An extensive woodland of willow and birch extends towards Lowhouse Farmlands. Extensive areas of rushes (Juncus sps) are present.|$|E
50|$|Some {{insects and}} {{dragonfly}} {{to be seen}} on the river include banded demoiselle, emerald damselfly, scarce emerald damselfly, large red damselfly, red-eyed damselfly, small red-eyed damselfly, azure damselfly, common blue damselfly, blue-tailed damselfly, migrant hawker, southern hawker, brown hawker, emperor dragonfly, four-spotted chaser, broad-bodied chaser, black-tailed skimmer, keeled skimmer, common darter, ruddy darter, <b>common</b> <b>hawker,</b> Norfolk hawker, hairy dragonfly, red-veined darter, yellow-winged darter, black darter and the variable damselfly.|$|E
50|$|Fry {{of smooth}} newt was {{reported}} in 2000, the only amphibian reported by the lake. An inventory of damselflies in 1997 resulted in a list of emerald damselfly, red-eyed damselfly, variable damselfly, southern hawker, brilliant emerald, four-spotted chaser, eastern white-faced darter, and black darter. A second inventory in 2000 produced the following list interpreted as a normal amount of species: <b>common</b> <b>hawker,</b> brown hawker, Irish damselfly, variable damselfly, downy emerald, red-eyed damselfly, northern white-faced darter, brilliant emerald, and black darter.|$|E
50|$|This small lochan (0.214 acres) {{is located}} on the south-facing slopes of Cuff Hill and may be artificial, as {{suggested}} by the number of old whinstone quarries in the vicinity. It is marked on the 1858 OS map and was deepened and modified for use as a reservoir, with a sluice and filter bed, probably once serving The Cuff Farm below it. The site is rich in wildlife, including <b>Common</b> <b>Hawker</b> dragonflies. The rare climbing corydalis Ceratocapnos claviculata grows amongst gorse nearby.|$|E
5000|$|Insects were abundant, {{particularly}} butterflies {{such as the}} red admiral, peacock, fritillary, {{cabbage white}} and large [...] "hawking" [...] species of dragonflies, such as the <b>common</b> <b>hawker</b> (Aeshna juncea). This last species was common {{in the area of}} the old duck pond. Wasp nests were a common occurrence in the old hedge walls and both red ants and black ants were to be found under stones beside the pathways. Mammals included hedgehogs, shrews, mice and bats (pipistrelles), which were common, as were grey squirrels. Amphibian species were frogs and toads in wetter places such as the old pampas on the front lawn.|$|E
50|$|Whooper swans {{and many}} other watefowl use the site. Roe deer use the {{surrounding}} scrub area and water lilies are {{a feature of the}} western end of the loch. Mute swans, heron, tufted duck, great crested grebe, and kingfisher are also present. Feeding and breeding in the surrounding wetland scrub are a variety of finches and even reed warblers, a notable species on the red data list. Meadow Brown butterflies are seen here as well as Common Blue Damselflies in the water vegetation at the west end of the loch with <b>Common</b> <b>Hawker</b> and Large Red Damselflies in drier habitat at the east end.|$|E
50|$|Another {{species of}} note, {{found in the}} wet flushed areas, is the nationally {{uncommon}} keeled skimmer dragonfly (Orthetrum coerulescens). This is a species of southern wet heathlands whose larvae develop in the wet mud of base-enriched flushes or bog pools. The valley is particularly rich in Odonata species: dragonflies recorded include the emperor (Anax imperator), golden-ringed (Cordulegaster boltonii), broad-bodied chaser (Libellula depressa), four-spotted chaser (Libellula quadrimaculata), southern hawker (Aeshna cyanea), <b>common</b> <b>hawker</b> (Aeshna juncea), black-tailed skimmer (Orthetrum cancellatum), common darter (Sympetrum striolatum), and black darter (Sympetrum danae); damselflies include the large red (Pyrrhosoma nymphula), azure (Coenagrion puella), emerald (Lestes sponsa), common blue (Enallagma cyathigerum), blue-tailed (Ischnura elegans), scarce blue-tailed (Ischnura pumilio), and beautiful demoiselle (Calopteryx virgo).|$|E
50|$|Was {{built around}} 1722 and {{had one of}} the largest wheels in the valley with a {{diameter}} of 15 ft. It was owned by the Windle brothers between 1818 and 1852 who used it for grinding knives and razors, after which it was sold to the Water Company. The mill was in regular use until 1918, but a survey in 1934 revealed that the internal machinery had been dismantled. The pond that served the Wolf Wheel is still in fine condition and has received much attention from the RVCG. It is one of four dams that are used by fishermen in the valley and surrounding wildlife includes Dragonfly's such as the common darter Sympetrum striolatum and the <b>common</b> <b>hawker,</b> Aeshna juncea. Other wildlife includes Kingfisher's, great diving beetles and amphibians such as the common frog and palmate newt.|$|E
