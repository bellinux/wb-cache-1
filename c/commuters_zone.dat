The political ‘distance’ between the northern <b>commuter</b> <b>zone</b> of the KMA (part of the Russian partition in the 19 th c.) {{and the rest of the}} KMA, decreased significantly. The suburban zone of Kraków also changed over the course of the study period by becoming significantly similar to the city in terms of voting behaviour. This political change was largely due to substantial social and economic changes in the rural parts of the metropolitan area. Urban areas in the KMA were much more stable in their voting patterns and tended to politically resemble one another much more than rural areas.

50|$|This {{model was}} the first to explain {{distribution}} of social groups within urban areas. Based on one single city, Chicago, it was created by sociologist Ernest Burgess in 1924. According to this model, a city grows outward from a central point in a series of rings. The innermost ring represents the central business district. It is surrounded by a second ring, the zone of transition, which contains industry and poorer-quality housing. The third ring contains housing for the working-class and is called the zone of independent workers' homes. The fourth ring has newer and larger houses usually occupied by the middle-class. This ring is called the zone of better residences. The outermost ring is called the <b>commuter's</b> <b>zone.</b> This zone represents people who choose to live in residential suburbs and take a daily commute into the CBD to work.|$|R

40|$|Suburbanisation {{today is}} not {{necessarily}} {{what it used to}} be: rather than suburbs being outer urban <b>commuter</b> <b>zones</b> for people who work in the central business district, people living in new suburbs are increasingly likely to work in those suburbs, or to commute to other outer suburbs as their places of work. At one level, such trends affirm the analyses of the ‘Los Angeles School’ of urban geographers about the shift from the classical modernist city, with radial zones spreading out from a city centre where core businesses were located, to a more decentralised, ‘postmodern’ city. But they increasingly move beyond this postmodern perspective, in that the many suburbs are themselves centres of work and industry, and not simply centres of lifestyle and consumption.

40|$|Efforts {{to manage}} Canadian cities through smart growth {{policies}} {{emphasize the importance}} of integrated public transit system and bicycle-transit integration. The goal {{of this paper is to}} review the impact of planning policies that promote utilitarian cycling on the provision of bicycle facilities (pathways, bikeways and parking) in Calgary. The focus is on new suburban communities built since the 1990 s, where new policies and standards affecting cycling have been implemented. The methodology draws on literature review, content analysis of major planning policies affecting utilitarian cycling, GIS spatial analysis of three case study areas and key informant interviews to holistically assess levels of bicycle-transit integration in Calgary. The research applies a straightforward and relatively robust framework for analysis of bicycle-transit integration using a number of quantitative indicators to assess levels of provision/accessibility and connectivity in transit <b>commuter</b> <b>zones.</b> The spatial analysis confirms that newer communities have better developed commuter-oriented cycling networks, bicycle facilities and integration with the light transit system compared to older ones. Despite area-specific challenges, findings indicate that the shift in planning policies in Calgary has a positive impact over the level of provision of bicycle infrastructure, which have the potential to increase utilitarian cycling in the future...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{historic}} {{myths and}} folklore, cities have always dominated Australia’s settlement patterns and its economy. This {{is evidenced by}} the continued drift of capital and labour to the faster moving urban environments from outlining regional areas. The nature and physical manifestation of regions continues to change like in areas of South-East Queensland. In spite all that, peri-urban expansion theories may prove inadequate to explain such patterns. The state capital, Brisbane dominates; however other centres in the region are now gaining relative importance and adding new dimensions to the region as a whole. The development of a multi-node into greater regions may bring into question relevance of the ‘optimum city size’ concept, particularly as locational trade-offs and interactions between existing and emerging nodes evolve. A close definition of what constitutes ‘peri-urban’ areas in such a spatial layout is difficult to establish. To be of greater use, the concept needs to go beyond the traditional definition of simply being the edge of existing development stretching out from a single node and rather to describe it as the balance of any region outside the existing principal centre. As such, the dynamic mixture of dormitory and <b>commuter</b> <b>zones</b> can come together with the recently created ‘activity nodes’ which {{is quite different from the}} traditional centre. This paper summarises research undertaken in South-east Queensland, Australia, one of the fastest growing urban area in the country. It challenges both concepts of optimum size and traditional definitions of peri-urban and describes how the new linkages between existing, dominant cities and distinct, new regional nodes are evolving. It is based on a literature review and structured interviews with key informants together with the author’s recent high level involvement both in the state government’s 30 -year vision called the Queensland Plan and the Sunshine Coast Regional Economic Development Strategy 2013 − 2033. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} research studies the housing behavior {{of young adults}} within a post-Fordist society. More specifically, it discusses the way young adults build up their housing career within the current society and how the post-Fordist context influences their housing behavior. Therefore, the research takes place on two different levels, namely the macro-social or societal level {{on the one hand}} and the level of the households on the other hand. Nevertheless, both levels interact constantly. Individual activities are always influenced by the society in which they take place, but conversely, a society can only exist when individual activities take place within a certain time and space. The purpose of this research is thus twofold. First of all, it investigates in what way the current societal developments shape the housing careers of young adults. Besides, it also examines the way in which the housing careers of young adults influence the society in which they take place and in what way they design the urban space. To reach these goals, the research starts by investigating in what way the Belgian society evolved from a Fordist to a post-Fordist society. Next, it continues by looking into detail to the developments that took place during the last decennia of post-Fordism. Specific attention is given to the evolution of migration dynamics and housing preferences since the beginning of the 1990 s. In general, one can conclude that since the end of the Second World War, a shift took place from a standardized and stable society which was characterized by a period of economic growth in which the family took a central position to a destandardized, flexible, diverse and individualistic society. Besides, the results show that until the first half of the 1990 s, housing choices were strongly related to the economical status of a certain period. Phases of economical growth went hand in hand with a reinforced suburbanization movement while this last process weakens during periods of economical recession. Nevertheless, from the second half of the 1990 s, this relationship doesnt coincide any more. Since then, suburbanization and urban interest seem to go hand in hand. But there where the city centre is especially attractive by the youngest young adults and non-Belgian population groups, the opposite is true for the suburban zones. Especially native (middle class) persons of 35 years and older opt for an suburban living environment. Remarkable to this last process is the increasing interest in the urban fringe and the <b>commuter</b> catchment <b>zone</b> instead of the classical suburbs as place of arrival. Empirical research to the individual housing behavior of middle class young adults show that the preferences concerning the housing type are very similar to that of their parents. The final goal is still the purchase of a single family dwelling with a private garden wich keeps on being encouraged by the government. As far as the preferred region concerns, the longer the more young adults seem to appreciate an urban living environment. But as the pursuit of the desired housing type is esteemed more important than the region where one will end up, lots of young adults exchange the city for the suburbs because of the lack (and thus the very high prices) of their preferred housing type within the city. This way, even today, suburbanization processes keep on going constantly. Nevertheless, even middle class young adults cannot afford a house in the oldest, classical but residential suburban areas anymore. Therefore, they are forced to go and look for alternative living environments or ways of living. This results in the rise of several housing strategies like second-hand suburbanization and suburbanization on a longer distance of town. Yet, the increased attractiveness of the city centre on young adults and non-Belgians, leads also to the shooting up of prices in these areas, especially in the very popular gentrification neighborhoods. Therefore, the latter region is spatially expanding in the direction of the cheaper urban working class areas which results in the rise of a so-called tension zones where middle class young adults start taking in the houses of the original but generally poorer inhabitants. As a consequence, the latter population group gets more and more excluded from its original home base and is forced to move to cheaper but often rather problematic neighborhoods. Looking to the social-economic profile of the young adults, the research shows that especially those groups which are typical for and clearly rising in number during the post-Fordist period, experience most difficulties. In general, we have to conclude that the mentality of young adults as well as the urban policies and the offer on the housing markets are still very Fordist of nature. At the same time, on the demographical, economical and socio-cultural level, society clearly evolves in a post-Fordist way. Building up an independent housing career in such an unbalanced society is not obvious. Nevertheless, the tensions resulting from this imbalance will finally force both the young adults as the policy makers and the housing market to adjust their behavior and offer according to the current needs. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{issues have}} large impacts on both {{developed}} and developing economies. In this dissertation, I focus on three environmental issues, assess their impacts, and {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} related remedies, using both ex-post evaluation and ex-ante forecasting methods. Using individual travel diary data collected before and after the rail transit coverage expansion in urban Beijing, the first chapter estimates the impact of rail accessibility improvement on the usage of rail transit, automobiles, buses, walking, and bicycling, measured as percent distance traveled by each mode in an individual trip. My results indicate that the average rail transit usage significantly increased, by 98. 3 % for commuters residing in the zones where the distances to the nearest station decreased because of the expansion, relative to <b>commuters</b> in the <b>zones</b> where the distances did not change. I also find that auto usage significantly decreased, by 19. 8 %, while the impact on bus usage was small and not statistically significant. Average walking and bicycling distance (combined) increased by 11. 8 %, indicating that walking and bicycling are complements to urban rail transit, instead of substitutes. Furthermore, I find that estimated changes in auto usage and rail transit usage vary significantly with auto ownership and income. Based on a coauthored paper with Peter Berck and Jintao Xu, the second chapter studies the collective forest tenure reform in China. In this reform, the Chinese government allowed collective village forest land to pass into individualized ownership. The government's purpose was to alleviate rural poverty, stimulate investment in forests, and improve forest conservation. Using data collected from 288 villages, in eight provinces, over three years, this chapter measures the effect of the individualization on one aspect of forest investment, forestation. Because villages voted on the reform, we identify the causal effect of the reform by an instrumental variable estimator based on the countywide decision to offer the reform package. We find an increase in forestation of 7. 87 % of forest land in the year of the reform, and no significant change in harvesting. It implies that the individualization of the village forestlands is on track to meet the societal goals concerning forest conditions. The third chapter is based on a coauthored paper with Sarah Lewis, Maximilian Auffhammer, and Peter Berck. In this chapter, we study crop coverage adaption to climate change. In the face of warming weather, famers may grow different crops that better fit in the new landscape. This type of adaptation may offset the negative effects of climate change. However, adaptation may be restricted by soil conditions, which determine crop yields and whether the substitution crops could fit in. The feasible amount of adaptation could be small, {{even in the face of}} substantial warming. Therefore, the negative effects of climate change can be offset only to a limited extent. In this paper, we pair a 10 -year panel of satellite-based crop coverage and soil data with a fine-scale weather data set that incorporates the whole distribution of temperatures within each day and across all days in the 10 -year period. Combining a proportion type model with local regressions, we simultaneously address the econometric issues of proportion dependent variables and spatial correlation of unobserved factors. Based on the estimates of crop choices, we predict future crop maps under several climate change scenarios. We find that rice and cotton spread toward the north, corn share increases, and soy share decreases on average. We also find that crop shifting patterns vary across quality levels of soils. There is less crop adaptation on better soils than on soils with lower quality...|$|R
