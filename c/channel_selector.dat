500|$|The ZX81 was {{designed}} to be small, simple, and above all cheap, using as few components as possible to keep the cost down. Video output was to a television set rather than a dedicated monitor. Programs and data were loaded and saved onto audio tape cassettes. It had only four silicon chips on board and a mere 1KB of memory. The machine had no power switch or any moving parts (with the exception of a VHF TV <b>channel</b> <b>selector</b> switch present on early [...] "ZX81 USA" [...] models and the Timex-Sinclair 1000) and used a pressure-sensitive membrane keyboard for manual input. The ZX81's limitations prompted the emergence of a flourishing market in third-party peripherals to improve its capabilities. Such limitations, however, achieved Sinclair's objective of keeping the cost of the machine as low as possible. Its distinctive case and keyboard brought its designer, Rick Dickinson, a Design Council award.|$|E

50|$|Conventional radios {{operate on}} fixed RF channels. In {{the case of}} radios with {{multiple}} channels, they operate on one channel at a time. The proper channel is selected by a user. The user operates a <b>channel</b> <b>selector</b> (dial or buttons) on the radio control panel to pick the appropriate channel.|$|E

50|$|The System/360 <b>selector</b> <b>channel</b> was {{followed}} by the System/370 block multiplexor channel which could operate as a <b>selector</b> <b>channel</b> to allow attachment of legacy subsystems.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{progress}} of a call the setting-up apparatus first connected the caller to a register equipment and later connected the caller to their correspondent {{by way of the}} [...] "highway" [...] switch, a <b>channel</b> <b>selector</b> choosing a free channel suitable for the call, that was, one available to both subscribers.|$|E
50|$|Options allow {{emergency}} {{messages to}} always be sent over a specific channel rather than the channel set by the operator using the <b>channel</b> <b>selector.</b> For example, a system with two channels could be programmed to send all emergency messages on channel 2. This reduces interruption of the primary dispatch channel if an emergency button is pressed.|$|E
5000|$|Speciality store - {{speciality}} good. The consumer {{has both}} {{a preference for}} a particular store and a specific brand. It would be naïve for the <b>channel</b> <b>selector</b> to assume that his/her market would not fall into only one or perhaps two of the various categories. He/she must study the market to see where his/her consumers concentrate {{in terms of the}} nine.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{for larger}} IBM System/360 computers, {{and even for}} early System/370 models, the <b>selector</b> <b>channels</b> and the {{multiplexor}} channels still were bulky and expensive separate processors, such as the IBM 2860 <b>Selector</b> <b>channel</b> (one to three <b>selector</b> <b>channels</b> in a single box), the IBM 2870 Byte multiplexor channel (one multiplexer channel, and, optionally, one selector subchannel in a single box) and the IBM 2880 Block multiplexor channel (one or two block multiplexor channels in a single box).|$|R
50|$|Rotary {{switches}} {{were used}} as <b>channel</b> <b>selectors</b> on television receivers until the early 1970s, as range selectors on electrical metering equipment, as band selectors on multi-band radios and other similar purposes. In industry, rotary switches are used for control of measuring instruments, switchgear, or in control circuits. For example, a radio controlled overhead crane may have a large multi-circuit rotary switch to transfer hard-wired control signals from the local manual controls in the cab to the outputs of the remote control receiver.|$|R
50|$|<b>Selector</b> <b>channels</b> enabled I/O to {{high speed}} devices. These storage devices were {{attached}} to a control unit {{and then to the}} channel. The control unit let clusters of devices be attached to the channels. On higher speed models, multiple <b>selector</b> <b>channels,</b> which could operate simultaneously or in parallel, improved overall performance.|$|R
50|$|Some radio users had {{selected}} the wrong channels. For example, on the Repeater 7 channel, a unit was heard to call Manhattan dispatch and Citywide. Although {{the circumstances that}} lead to the user selecting the wrong channel are not known, this can occur when the user is trapped in darkness or smoke and cannot see the radio. Users will typically try to count steps in a rotary switch <b>channel</b> <b>selector</b> starting {{from one end of the}} switch's travel.|$|E
50|$|Each 8-track tape {{contained}} four game programs, and {{the system}} featured a <b>channel</b> <b>selector</b> dial on the top to chose which program to play. After inserting a tape and adjusting volume via a slider on top next to the <b>channel</b> <b>selector,</b> each player participating would need to press enter. Subsequently, players would be asked questions played back from the tape. Players would then be asked to answer {{as quickly as possible}} (indicated by dashes on the display), by selecting the correct colour, number, or spelling out a word and pressing Enter. Players were then awarded typically between 1 and 4 points, with typically the first player receiving an additional point for answering first. The Jeopardy cartridge varied from this scoring system, following {{along the lines of the}} Jeopardy scoring system from the first rounds of a game. After all players answered, the correct answer would be revealed and the points on the displays updated. At the end of the game the winning player would be indicated. Occasional music interludes (such as in the Password Plus game) would occur while the tape played to the correct location to continue gameplay. Occasionally the display of the player with the leading score would also flash.|$|E
50|$|In {{the simple}} {{case of the}} taxi company, each radio had a {{manually}} operated <b>channel</b> <b>selector</b> knob to tune to different frequencies. As the drivers moved around, they would change from channel to channel. The drivers knew which frequency covered approximately what area. When they did not receive a signal from the transmitter, they would try other channels until they found one that worked. The taxi drivers would only speak one at a time, when invited by the base station operator. This is, in a sense, time division multiple access (TDMA).|$|E
40|$|Cala-gopher is a library-level Scala {{implementation}} of communication sequence process constructs: <b>channels,</b> <b>selectors</b> (similar to analogical constructs in Limbo or Go) transputers (similar to Occam proc) {{and a set}} of high-level operations on top of akka and SIP- 22 async. The framework integrates CSP-style programming into standard Scala concurrency environment via idiomatic API. This allows usage of communication patterns, well known in Go world, but not easy expressable in mainstream scala concurrency frameworks, along with algebraic approach for composing computation builders.

50|$|The ARC-164 is a {{military}} UHF AM aircraft station that operates between 225-399.975 MHz and transmits at 10 watts. It features a separate guard receiver for monitoring 243 MHz while simultaneously monitoring the active channel selected, an ECCM slice capable of storing multiple Word-of-Day patterns for Havequick operation, and can {{also serve as a}} <b>channel</b> <b>selector</b> and audio demodulator for separate UHF DF systems. There are 2 common installations: remote and panel. With a remote installation, the R/T is in a remote location, while the panel installation features an all-in-one R/T and control panel.|$|E
50|$|There are group virtual channels, where {{groups of}} mobile and hand held radios are {{addressed}} {{based on their}} system and group (virtual <b>channel</b> <b>selector)</b> setting. On a commercial system, a typical group might be a small business such as a towing company. On a government system, a typical group might be {{a group of people}} in a department with similar tasks such as the city street department. When any user in the group talks, all radios with their selector set to that group meet on a virtual channel and can communicate. When the conversation ends, radios immediately begin a search for another call.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{conventional}} radios use, or have {{an option}} for, a talk-back-on-scan function. If the user transmits when the radio is in a scan mode, it may transmit {{on the last}} channel received instead of the selected channel. This may allow users of multi-channel radios to reply to the last message without looking at the radio to see which channel it was on. Without this feature, the user would {{have to use the}} <b>channel</b> <b>selector</b> to switch to the channel where the last message occurred. (This option can cause confusion and users must be trained to understand this feature.) ...|$|E
5000|$|A block {{multiplexer}} channel {{is capable of}} concurrently running multiple channel programs, but only {{one at a time}} can be active. The control unit can request suspension {{at the end of a}} channel command and can later request resumption. This is intended for devices in which there is a mechanical delay after completion of data transfer, e.g., for seeks on moving-head DASD. The {{block multiplexer}} channel was a late addition to the System/360 architecture; early machines had only byte multiplexer <b>channels</b> and <b>selector</b> <b>channels.</b> The block multiplexer channel was an optional feature only on the models 85 and 195. The block multiplexor channel was also available on the later System/370 computers.|$|R
5000|$|There were {{initially}} {{two types of}} channels; byte-multiplexer channels (known at the time simply as [...] "multiplexor channels"), for connecting [...] "slow speed" [...] devices such as card readers and punches, line printers, and communications controllers, and <b>selector</b> <b>channels</b> for connecting high speed devices, such as disk drives, tape drives, data cells and drums. Every System/360 (except for the Model 20, which was not a standard 360) had a byte-multiplexer channel and 1 or more <b>selector</b> <b>channels.</b> The smaller models (up to the model 50) had integrated channels, while for the larger models (model 65 and above) the channels were large separate units in separate cabinets, such as the IBM 2860 and 2870. (The 60, 62, and 70 had allowed only for 2860 <b>selector</b> <b>channels,</b> {{on the assumption that}} they would all have smaller 360s attached, which would do the slow-speed work.) ...|$|R

50|$|The WaveBird {{controller}} {{maintains the}} same overall aesthetic design {{as the standard}} GameCube controller. The components (analog sticks, buttons, and triggers) and layout remain the same, while adding wireless functionality and space for two standard AA batteries. It is somewhat larger and heavier than a standard GameCube controller, with a <b>channel</b> <b>selector</b> dial, an on/off switch, and an orange LED power indicator {{on the face of}} the controller in place of the gap between the D-pad and the C-stick. Functionally, the only feature the WaveBird controller lacks compared to the standard controller is the rumble feature, the motors of which would reduce battery life.|$|E
5000|$|The 27 MHz Class C {{channels}} are not officially numbered by the FCC. R/C enthusiasts usually designate them by color, and fly different-colored flags from the antenna to show {{who is on}} which channel. [...] On the other hand, some CB operators illegally use these channels for voice communications, and usually {{refer to them as}} an alternate of the closest voice channel below them (such as 3A, as shown in the table). In CB radios whose <b>channel</b> <b>selector</b> was a multiple-gang rotary switch that presented a binary number to the tuning electronics, it was a common illegal modification to add a toggle switch (or rewire an existing switch, such as the [...] "PA" [...] switch that coupled the microphone to an outside speaker) to modify the low-order bit and thus gain access to the R/C channels.|$|E

The game cartridge socket is no longer angled, but is mounted vertically on the board. 2600A model differences - revisions 14 and 15Revisions 14 and 15 contain the model differences described above, and in addition have new components on the TIA lines, LM1 and Sync. There are two 1N914 diodes to prevent feedback on the lines and two additional pull-up resistors to insure the signal is at +5v. To compensate for any signal loss, R215 and 217 have been changed to 47K (R215) and 24K (R217).2600A model differences - revisions 16 and upRevisions 16 and up contain the model differences described above; they also include a timer chip (A205) added to the reset circuitry of the MPU chip.

Pye found themselves with high stocks and low cash flow {{at a time when}} industrial relations were poor, the economy was ailing and there was little scope for cost reduction. Foundering, the Pye group of companies was bought outright by Philips in 1976. The Lowestoft factory was subsequently sold to Sanyo and Philips moved the manufacture of Pye televisions to Singapore. Prior to the manufacturing offshoring, the company produced a range of televisions branded 'Pye Chelsea'. The range were teak-clad with stainless steel 'feet' and sported three large <b>channel</b> <b>selectors.</b> Whilst unsuitable for the reception of the oncoming Channel 4, the equipment would operate through early video recorders, machines with larger channel capability. The Chelsea range were popular with TV rental companies such as Radio Rentals, Rumbelows and Wigfalls. Maintenance of these sets continued well into the 1980s, with the northern rental chain Wigfalls being the last to withdraw them in 1988.|$|R

It used a disk operating system and had either a 300 or 600 lines per minute printer, a card reader, optionally a card punch, a console (Uniscope 100), attached disk drives that had removable disk packs, several 1600 or 6250 BpI tape drives, and an optional communications controller supporting up to 16 terminals (later 32) The standard disk drive was the 8416 which held a multi-layer platter removable disk pack that held approximately 29 million bytes. The 8418 drive was an enhanced version that supported both 29MB and [...] "double-density" [...] 58MB disk packs. These disk drives operated on the IDA (Integrated Disk Adapter). There was also an optional 8430 drive with a 100MB capacity that operated on a separate high speed <b>selector</b> <b>channel.</b> Available tape drives were the Uniservo 10 (Mux Channel) and Uniservo 14 (<b>Selector</b> <b>channel).</b> The optional <b>Selector</b> <b>Channel</b> also enabled the use of other high speed devices such as the 1200 lpm 0776 printer or the 2000 lpm 0770 printer.
