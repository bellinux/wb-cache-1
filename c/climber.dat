5|$|Lobatus gigas has {{an unusual}} means of locomotion, first {{described}} in 1922 by George Howard Parker (1864–1955). The animal first fixes the posterior {{end of the}} foot by thrusting {{the point of the}} sickle-shaped operculum into the substrate, then it extends the foot in a forward direction, lifting and throwing the shell forward in a so-called leaping motion. This way of moving is considered to resemble that of pole vaulting, making L.gigas a good <b>climber</b> even of vertical concrete surfaces. This leaping locomotion may help prevent predators from following the snail's chemical traces, which would otherwise leave a continuous trail on the substrate.|$|E
5|$|Most boulderers use {{gymnastics}} chalk {{on their}} hands to absorb sweat. It is stored in a small chalkbag which can be tied around the waist, allowing the <b>climber</b> to reapply chalk during the climb. Brushes are used to remove excess chalk and other debris from boulders in between climbs; they are often attached {{to the end of}} a stick, pipe, or other straight object in order to reach higher holds. Crash pads, also referred to as bouldering mats, are foam cushions placed on the ground to protect climbers from falls.|$|E

5|$|Bouldering {{is a form}} of rock {{climbing}} that is performed on large boulders, small rock formations or artificial rock walls, without the use of ropes or harnesses. While it can be done without any equipment whatsoever, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry and provide a firmer grip, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls. Unlike free solo climbing, which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (the path that a <b>climber</b> takes in order to complete the climb) are usually less than 6 meters (20ft.) tall. Artificial climbing walls allow boulderers to train indoors in areas without natural boulders. Bouldering competitions, which employ a variety of formats, take place in both indoor and outdoor settings.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1930s, {{more than}} a dozen {{different}} climbing routes had been established on Grand Teton including the northeast ridge in 1931 by Glenn Exum. Glenn Exum teamed up with another noted <b>climber</b> named Paul Petzoldt to found the Exum Mountain Guides in 1931. Of the other major peaks on the Teton Range, all were climbed by the late 1930s including Mount Moran in 1922 and Mount Owen in 1930 by Fritiof Fryxell and others after numerous previous attempts had failed. Both Middle and South Teton were first climbed on the same day, August 29, 1923, by a group of climbers led by Albert R. Ellingwood. New routes on the peaks were explored as safety equipment and skills improved and eventually climbs rated at above 5.9 on the Yosemite Decimal System difficulty scale were established on Grand Teton. The classic climb following the route first pioneered by Owen, known as the Owen-Spalding route, is rated at 5.4 due a combination of concerns beyond the gradient alone. Rock climbing and bouldering had become popular in the park by the mid 20th century. In the late 1950s, gymnast John Gill came to the park and started climbing large boulders near Jenny Lake. Gill approached climbing from a gymnastics perspective and while in the Tetons became the first known <b>climber</b> in history to use gymnastic chalk to improve handholds and to keep hands dry while climbing. During the latter decades of the 20th century, extremely difficult cliffs were explored including some in Death Canyon, and by the mid-1990s, 800 different climbing routes had been documented for the various peaks and canyon cliffs.|$|E

The runners were divided into two groups based on their climbing level, according to the International Rock Climbing Research Association (IRCRA). Elite <b>climbers</b> represented a 8 b- 8 c Rotpunkt (RP) climbing level (n = 6), and advanced <b>climbers</b> represented an 7 c+- 8 a RP level (n = 14). The following measurements were assessed: height, weight, lean body mass, upper limb length, arm span, and forearm, arm, thigh and calf circumference. The BMI, Rohrer ratio, and Ape Index were also measured. The following motor tests were assessed: a specific test for finger strength, an arm strength test, and a test of muscle endurance (hanging from 2. 5 and 4 cm ledges). In addition, pull ups were used to measure muscle resistance to fatigue. Elite <b>climbers</b> recorded significantly higher values for finger strength than advanced <b>climbers</b> (129. 08 vs. 111. 54 kg; t(18) = 2. 35, p = 0. 03) and arm endurance (33. 17 vs. 25. 75 pull ups; t(18) = 2. 54, p = 0. 02).
