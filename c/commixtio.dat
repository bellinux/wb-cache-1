Personal property may be acquired by occupancy (including the accessio, <b>commixtio,</b> and confusio of Roman law), by invention, as patent and copyright, or by transfer, either by the act of the law (as in bankruptcy, judgment and intestacy), or by the act of the party (as in gift, contract and will).|$|E
5000|$|In the Cistercian Missal {{before the}} reform of Claude Vaussin, there were wide divergences between the Cistercian and Roman rites. The psalm [...] "Judica" [...] was not said, but in its stead was recited the [...] "Veni Creator"; the [...] "Indulgentiam" [...] was {{followed}} by the [...] "Pater" [...] and [...] "Ave", and the [...] "Oramus te Domine" [...] was omitted in kissing the altar. After the [...] "Pax Domini sit semper vobiscum", the [...] "Agnus Dei" [...] was said thrice, and was followed immediately by [...] "HÃ¦c sacrosancta <b>commixtio</b> corporis", said by the priest while placing the small fragment of the Sacred Host in the chalice; then the [...] "Domine Jesu Christe, Fili Dei Vivi" [...] was said, but the [...] "Corpus Tuum" [...] and [...] "Quod ore sumpsimus" [...] were omitted. The priest said the [...] "Placeat", and then [...] "Meritis et precibus istorum et onmium sanctorum. Suorum misereatur nostri Omnipotens Dominus. Amen", while kissing the altar; and then, as again now in the Roman Rite, ended Mass with the sign of the Cross. Outside of some minor exceptions in the wording and conclusions of various prayers, the other parts of the Mass were the same as in the Roman Rite. Also in some Masses of the year the ordo was different; for instance, on Palm Sunday the Passion was only said at the high Mass, at the other Masses a special gospel only being said. However, since the time of Claude Vaussin the differences from the Roman Mass became insignificant.|$|E
