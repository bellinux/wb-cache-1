40|$|The non-shrinking {{property}} of silicon-infiltrated silicon carbide (SiSiC) makes it ideal {{for the production}} of larger and complex shaped ceramic components. However, its industrial realisation often fails due to the high level of manufacturing expenditure, based on process-related uncertainties and high device-related expenses. The focus of this thesis is the creation of scientific and technical requirements for the development of innovative manufacturing processes for such structural ceramics. These have to guarantee a high degree of process reliability and reproductibility as well as to hold its ground in the economic competition with other technologies. The crucial issue is the implementation of polymer concrete casting techniques on <b>ceramic</b> <b>moulding</b> during the manufacturing process. Hereby, a polymer concrete formation consisting of a mixture of SiC powders and a special binding agent was developed. This formation can be casted in an open mold without pressure followed by a curing stage. After curing, the polymer concrete can be converted into SiSiC by a pyrolisis and a reaction bonding process with liquid silicon. This casting technique enables the easy production of large and complex shaped components especially with undercuts and wall thickness differences. In addition to the production method, this work also discusses the mechanical properties of the resulting ceramics and demonstrates possible applications with a realisation of a ceramic radial flow pump impeller...|$|E
40|$|In the {{previous}} decades, {{the investigation of}} the optical properties of materials has lead to a number of important developments like the laser, optical fibre cables and high precision spectrometers. In 1987, Yablonovich and John suggested a possibility to tailor the optical properties of a material {{in a way that the}} flow of electromagnetic waves could be controlled by the creation of a band structure for allowed and forbidden states: the so called "electromagnetic bandgap". It was found out that such structures could exhibit improved properties that could not be achieved with conventional treatment of light waves, for example higher quality factors, low radiation losses in sharp bends in waveguides, low dispersion waveguiding and frequency selective substrates. Another feature of EBG materials was that their properties could be scaled to an arbitrary frequency range by rescaling the lattice constant of the dielectric lattice. This scalability makes them interesting for possible applications in the frequency range in between the microwave and optical ranges, the so called "Terahertz gap". In the frame of this work, the suitability of electromagnetic bandgap structures for possible applications as integrated passive element in circuits from the microwave up to the millimetre wave range has been investigated. It has been taken advantage from the scalability of the EBG properties, which makes it possible to investigate structures at low frequencies where fabrication, assembly and measurement are relatively easy and to scale up the results that have been found. In the first part of this work, a theoretical description of the behavior of electromagnetic waves in periodic dielectric media is given, and thus the basic properties of EBG structures are derived from the appropriate solutions of Maxwell's equations. A number of EBG lattice structures are presented, and described by band structure calculations. Furthermore the behavior of point and line defects in the lattice, is investigated, and a slab structure that can provide a three dimensional confinement is presented. In the second part, a number of fabrication schemes for EBG structures from microwave up to millimetre wave frequencies are presented, which have been investigated in the frame of this work, in collaboration with partners. Different ways of fabricating have been investigated such as mechanical treatment, moulding techniques and microfabrication techniques (laser machining and Silicon etching) and different material systems are employed. In the third part of this work, the simulated and fabricated structures have been investigated experimentally at frequencies of 10, 20, 30 and 100 GHz with respect to a possible application as passive transmission line elements and high quality factor resonant structures. For frequencies of 10 GHz, it has been shown that in a 2 D EBG structure for TM waves the strength of the coupling to a defect resonance could be tuned and optimised by size variation of adjacent lattice elements to yield low insertion loss. Furthermore, a broadband waveguiding with little reflection by line defects with a width of one and three lattice periods could be shown. A three dimensional confinement of modes has been demonstrated in both simulation and experiment for a 3 D EBG structure with a band gap at 20 GHz. For frequencies around 30 GHz, the creation of a band gap in a 2 D EBG structure that was prepared by a <b>ceramic</b> <b>moulding</b> technique with a band gap for TM waves has been demonstrated and a resonant cavity mode with moderate quality factor could be observed. Two different structures with band gaps at frequencies around 100 GHz were investigated and it was shown that a 2 D interconnected structure could exhibit a band gap for TM waves and provide a high mechanical stability without the need for a backfilling material. A 2 D slab structure could provide a three dimensional confinement of defect modes by a combination of both band gap guiding and index guiding. A broadband waveguiding by a line defect mode in this slab structure was shown, and it was demonstrated that a localised mode in a point defect could act as a high quality factor cavity in both band pass and band reject configuration...|$|E

In the ceramic slurry, quartz sand was applied as ceramic aggregate, silica sol containing 30 % silicon dioxide as bonder, and the weight ratio of quartz sand to silica sol was 2. 69; the dispersed fibers changed from 0 to 0. 24 vol. %. The mould samples were formed after the slurry was poured and gelled at room temperature, and then sintered at different temperatures ranging from 100 to 800 ℃ to measure the tensile strength and shrinkage rate. The results show that, with the aluminum silicate fiber addition increasing from 0 to 0. 24 vol. %, the tensile strength increases linearly from 0. 175 MPa to 0. 236 MPa, and the shrinkage rate decreases linearly from 1. 75 % to 1. 68 % for the <b>ceramic</b> <b>mould</b> sintered at 400 ℃, from 1. 37 % to 1. 31 % for the <b>ceramic</b> <b>mould</b> at room temperature.

The C-E transition is fundamental phenomenon {{that can be applied}} to characterize massive cast steel ingots produced by the casting house. The mentioned ratio is created spontaneously due to the rate of heat transfer towards the <b>ceramic</b> <b>mould</b> and then to the environment. The <b>ceramic</b> <b>mould</b> operates as an isolator. So that the thickness of the mould together with a growing solid fraction control the heat transfer and finally the ratio of the columnar structure area to the equiaxed structure area. At first the increase of heat accumulation within the <b>ceramic</b> <b>mould</b> is observed. Next the stationary state for heat transfer is created and finally a gentle abatement of the mould temperature associated with the heat output to the environment is expected. The steep thermal gradients correspond to the increase of heat accumulation in the <b>ceramic</b> <b>mould.</b> The steep thermal gradients are required to promote the columnar structure formation. The full heat accumulation in the mould corresponds well with the C-E transformation while the appearance of the moderate thermal gradients is referred to the gentle temperature abatement within the <b>ceramic</b> <b>mould.</b> The equiaxed structure is expected within this period of heat transfer behavior. The steep thermal gradients involve the activity of viscosity gradient in the liquid. As the result a sedimentary cones are formed {{at the bottom of the}} ingot. The C-E transformation is associated with competition between columnar and equaixed structure formation. At the end of competition a fully equiaxed structure is formed. The viscosity gradient is replaced by the thermophoresis which is the driving force for the deposition of some equiaxed grain layers onto the surface of C+E zone. The convection together with the gravity allow the layers to be uniform along the whole height of the ingot. Some equiaxed grain layers are also deposited at the bottom of ingot onto the surface of sedimentary cones due to activity of the gravity. Additionally, some macro-segregation effects are observed in the ingot. There are “A” – type macro-segregation phenomenon and „V” – type macro-segregation phenomenon. Both mentioned phenomena result from the so-called canal micro-segregation which appears due to the deposition of the equiaxed grains onto the bottom of ingot. Micro-fissures, porosity and micro-shrinkage are the result of the segregation phenomena occurring during the ingot solidification. Three ranges within the temperature filed created in the <b>ceramic</b> <b>mould</b> are to be distinguished:a/ for the formation of columnar structure (the C – zone) : (0 T and steep thermal gradients in the liquid),b/ for the EC transition (columnar to fully equiaxed structure) : (0 T and the so-called critical thermal gradient in the liquid),c/ for the formation of fully equiaxed structure (the E – zone) : (0 T and moderate thermal gradients in the liquid) ...|$|R
