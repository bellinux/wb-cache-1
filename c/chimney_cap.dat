5000|$|In 1916, the SAR ordered six {{narrow gauge}} Pacific tender {{locomotives}} from Baldwin Locomotive Works. They had outside bar frames and Walschaerts valve gear and became {{popularly known as}} the Sixties, based on their engine number range. Typically American in appearance, with an ornate <b>chimney</b> <b>cap</b> and steam dome {{as well as a}} separate engine number on a disk {{on the front of the}} smokebox door, they were the only narrow gauge Pacific tender locomotives to see service on the SAR. Later designated Class NG10, they were placed in service on the Langkloof line between Port Elizabeth and Avontuur in the Eastern Cape, where they spent most of their working lives. In 1948, two of them were transferred to South West Africa (SWA). All six were withdrawn from service by 1962 as a direct result of the widening of the narrow gauge lines in SWA to [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{royal blue}} of the Great Eastern livery, with its scarlet lining, was embellished with a copper <b>chimney</b> <b>cap,</b> and brass {{beadings}} round {{the rim of the}} safety valve casing, the front and side cab windows, {{the top and bottom of}} both cylinders of the Westinghouse brake compressor, the coupled wheel splashers, and the four openings that had been cut in subsidiary coupling rod splashers - in London and North Western Railway style - to give access to the coupling rod pins when the rods were up. In contrast with the blue livery was the vermilion in which the buffer beam and coupling rods were painted. Another feature of great distinction, begun by James Holden with the Claud Hamiltons, was the broad steel ring, polished bright, that encircled the smokebox door, and made it possible to dispense with the usual straps across the door. Before very long, the painted representation of the GER coat-of-arms on the driving splashers was replaced by a replica cast in relief and picked out in colour. The tenders were replaced with standard GER ones when oil firing came to an end. The cab windows were round.|$|E
40|$|Smoke {{and toxic}} gases emitted from {{chimneys}} present health hazard. Their concentration should be minimised {{before reaching the}} ground. The wind lowers the concentration before it reaches the surface. However, heavier than air toxic gases flow downward which is particularly problematic {{in the case of}} low wind speeds in high-density populated areas. Two effective solutions are to extend the height of the chimney or to employ a filter but generally these solutions are not practical or economical for residential applications. An innovative low-cost <b>chimney</b> <b>cap</b> is proposed to dilute toxic gases within the chimney before ejection. The configuration of the cap is inspired from chambers which are currently used to generate fire-whirl in the laboratory. The cap consists of two identical half cylinders which are placed off-centre {{at the top of the}} chimney. The previous experiments indicate that the entrained air swirls around the central vertical axis of the chamber and generates a whirling motion. The chimney discharge and the exhaust concentration are computed by modelling the cap. The computational results indicate that such a configuration not only is able to reduce the concentration of the discharge, but also is able to increase the discharge at low wind speeds. ...|$|E
50|$|The two-story {{rectangular}} {{building measures}} 50 by 143 ft, {{and it has}} a full basement. The foundation and walls are made of concrete. The front facade is of tan-colored brick paired with darker brown brick above the storefront, its window pairs, and its decorative horizontal corbel courses. Strong vertical elements include pilasters that extend above the roof line and are topped with imitation <b>chimney</b> <b>caps.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{northeast}} face {{is similar}} to the southwest; the gable has the same window, stone shields, and [...] "I"-shaped band. The belt course continues around the facade, and six 10/15 windows are arrayed at ground level. At the building's north corner is a rectangular brick <b>chimney,</b> <b>capped</b> by stone with a quoin at each corner. The corner also features five windows with a limestone course at the window head.|$|R
50|$|In {{comparison}} to the NGR version, the IMR locomotives were more ornate. In true military tradition, the domes, <b>chimney</b> <b>caps</b> and boiler bands were of polished brass. A weatherboard was affixed to the coal bunker to offer better protection to the crew while travelling bunker forward. The practice of polished brasswork was followed on all new IMR locomotives and was continued even after the railways became the Central South African Railways (CSAR) {{at the end of}} the war.|$|R

50|$|Greenlawn, {{also known}} as the Outten Davis House and William Brady House, was a {{historic}} home located at Middletown, New Castle County, Delaware. It was built about 1810, and radically altered about 1860. It was a two-story, five bay, brick dwelling with cross-gable roof with dormers. It had a rear brick ell with attached wing. It featured a three-bay front porch, large brackets, a widow's walk on the roof, and ornate <b>chimney</b> <b>caps.</b> It was originally built in the Late Georgian style, then modified with Late Victorian details.|$|R
50|$|The Nathan A. Woodworth House is a {{historic}} house at 28 Channing Street in New London, Connecticut. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with asymmetrical massing and a busy roof line characteristic of the Queen Anne style. It {{has a number of}} different types of projections and roof gables, decorative <b>chimney</b> <b>caps,</b> and a front porch with turned posts and balustrade. The house was built in 1890 for Nathan Woodworth, who was in the paper milling business in nearby Waterford; its design appears to be an adaptation from an architectural pattern book.|$|R
50|$|While the IMR {{locomotive}} {{was identical}} in construction to those {{built for the}} NGR, it had a weatherboard affixed to the coal bunker to offer the crew better protection against the elements when travelling bunker forward. The locomotives were more ornate than those in Natal and, in true military style, their brass domes, <b>chimney</b> <b>caps</b> and boiler bands were polished. The practice of polished brasswork was a trade mark of the IMR and was done with all their new locomotives. It was continued on the Central South African Railways (CSAR) after the IMR was disbanded.|$|R
50|$|The Bucknam House is {{a modest}} 1-1/2 story wood frame Cape house, five bays wide, {{with a side}} gable roof, {{clapboard}} siding, and a granite foundation. Oriented to face the northwest, the main facade has a center entry with a wooden fan above, and Doric pilasters at the sides, topped by carved reliefs of wooden urns. A kitchen ell extends to the northeast. Both main block and ell have <b>chimneys</b> <b>capped</b> by distinctive arched brick covers. The interior of the house has exquisitely-detailed woodwork, including beaded moldings, friezes, fireplace mantels, and door frames. The main parlor still has its original wallpaper.|$|R
50|$|The Croul-Palms house boasts {{irregular}} massing, contrasting materials, and {{a picturesque}} roofline, all details characteristic of Queen Anne style architecture. The house is 2½ stories, and is constructed from red brick on a rock-faced stone foundation. There are additional curved stone details, {{as well as}} stone banding and stone window hoods. The house has bay windows stretching the full three stories, and the multi-level roof boasts projecting gables and decorative <b>chimney</b> <b>caps.</b> The exterior {{of the house is}} original but for the demolition of front and side porches and a small third-floor balconet, and the replacement of the slate roof.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} of the hotel was punctuated with numerous Cambridge finial topped turrets, dormers, gables of varying sizes and red brick <b>chimneys</b> <b>capped</b> with classic Victorian cowls. The exterior walls were clad primarily in scalloped gingerbread wood siding with an almost castle-like brick foundation wall that stood over six feet high. Hundreds of double hung windows ensured that every room was “touched by the Sun” {{at some point in}} the day. Windows throughout the third floor level were 15-over-1 style. The upper pane was divided into a central pane surrounded by 14 smaller framed panes. Second floor windows were simple double-hung panes with no grids.|$|R
5000|$|Daniel Harrison House, {{also known}} as Fort Harrison, is a {{historic}} home located near Dayton, Rockingham County, Virginia. It was built in 1748, and is a two-story, three bay limestone dwelling with a brick extension added in the early 1800s. It has a steep gable roof and wide <b>chimney</b> <b>caps.</b> It was originally surrounded by a palisade and stories of an underground passage to the nearby spring. During the French and Indian War, the legislature of Virginia designed the house [...] "Fort Harrison."

5000|$|The Ironwood City Hall was a two-story, rectangular, vernacular Richardsonian {{structure}} with an exterior of tan brick with smooth brownstone belt cornices on {{a foundation of}} rough cut brown sandstone. [...] The hip roof was covered in steel, and an eighty-foot-high tower, originally capped with a pagoda-roofed open turret, was located on one corner. There were several ground-floor entrances, including a tower entrance, a double door for fire equipment, and entrances {{to the police station}} and library. The windows were rectangular and symmetrically arranged, with decorative windows in wall dormers on the upper story. Decorative trim, including gable pilasters and finials, <b>chimney</b> <b>caps</b> and cornices, appeared bulbuous and weighty.|$|R
25|$|The Lake–Peterson House {{is one of}} the U.S. {{state of}} Illinois' finest {{examples}} of Gothic Revival architecture, specifically Victorian Gothic. The asymmetrical two-story residence is constructed of yellow brick and sits upon a stone foundation. Its steeply pitched roof is clad in slate tiles and each of the four sides of the original home features a decorative gable. The house also features tall brick chimneys with corbelled <b>chimney</b> <b>caps,</b> dormers, bay windows and a large veranda. The architect, if there was one, is unknown, though it is probable that Lake himself was the builder. One possibility is that John Lake obtained the architectural plans in England, his native land, where he had returned from as construction on the house began in 1873.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} {{designed}} as a Mediterranean Revival style house with Italian and Spanish motif. The entrance has an ornate semi-circular wrought iron door leading into a large foyer. The front entry hall opens into a large living room and a smaller parlor. A formal staircase rises to an open landing and to a study. The second story bedrooms are used as offices for Alumni and Foundation staff. The rear consists of a formal dining room, kitchen, and pantry. The building has three <b>chimneys</b> <b>capped</b> with campaniles that resemble Italian bell towers. The residence's exterior is framed by concrete planters and topped by a wrought iron balcony outside of the second floor French windows. The roof is low-pitched red-barrel tile.|$|R
5000|$|The Cady-Lee was {{designed}} in the Shingle Style that was popular {{on the east coast}} of the United States in the 1880s. The three-story structure is asymmetrical in design and is built over a basement. It contains 22 rooms, has 50 windows, 12-foot ceilings, seven gables and turreted sleeping porch. [...] The main façade is dominated by a tower-like bay on the northeast corner. On the second story the dormer and the gable ends are covered in scalloped shaped shingles. They extend down the house to form the porch and veranda roofs. The roofline is varied and reflects the Shingle Style. It consists of gables and cross gables that are topped by finials and two brick chimneys with corbelled <b>chimney</b> <b>caps.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Their {{most notable}} {{project is the}} Harvey Graham Beach House, built in 1953. It {{was seen as a}} vanguard of post-war {{residential}} architecture. The design itself was in typical Hayes & Scott style with a slab-on-ground construction, flat roof and floor-to-ceiling glazing. The project was influenced by architects such as Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Due to similar characteristics, it has also been said that the design of the Beach House was strongly influenced by the drawings of the Case Study House by Charles Eames. Along with the modernist design came the murals which portrayed the partnership’s developmental approach to colour. Their love of using black on everything [...] "against the sky" [...] (e.g. eaves, gutters, <b>chimney</b> <b>caps,</b> etc.) is also seen.|$|R
50|$|The Hawthorn Leslie {{locomotives}} {{were blue}} with brass dome covers and <b>chimney</b> <b>caps.</b> Once the LSWR had absorbed the PD&SWJR, nos. 3-5 were repainted in LSWR livery and renumbered 756-8; this process took several months, completed with no. 757 Earl of Mount Edgcumbe in October 1923. They were repainted in SR livery between March 1926 and April 1927, and their LSWR numbers were prefixed {{with the letter}} E, denoting Eastleigh Works, which had been responsible for their maintenance following the cessation of repairs at Callington Road in mid-1923. The E prefix was dropped on the SR's 1931 renumbering. British Railways livery and numbers were applied to 757 (30757) in May 1949 and 758 (30758) in December 1950, but 756 was withdrawn in October 1951 without being renumbered. 30757 and 30758 were withdrawn in December 1957 and December 1956 respectively.|$|R
50|$|The side {{elevations}} {{are mostly}} similar in treatment. The north facade has four-over-four frosted {{glass in the}} second and fourth bays at both levels and the south has a large, two-level arched window in the center bay with two six-over-six windows. In the rear the balustrade has five solid marble panels. The <b>chimney,</b> brick <b>capped</b> with marble, rises from the roof just south of the northeast corner.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} was originally a single storey {{with a second}} storey added on much later. The buildings also have massed informal windows, recessed doors, rendered <b>chimneys</b> with moulded <b>caps</b> and a cantilevered box verandah.|$|R
25|$|The Clarence Moore House is {{a classic}} example of the Beaux Arts {{architectural}} style and features a Louis XV-style exterior. The -story structure includes a basement and comprises brick walls, a concrete floor, and a steel roof. The building measures 79.5 feet (24.2m) in height and the walls are made of Roman brick. A limestone Tuscan entablature with a bracket cornice separate the third and fourth floors. The building's north entrance on Massachusetts Avenue has a 6x6foot (1.8x1.8m) stoop flanked by limestone balustrades. Above the entrance and ground floor windows are limestone corbels and guttae. The corbels support limestone second floor balconies and a vase balustrade. The third floor balconies are made of limestone and feature cast iron railings. The second, third, and fourth floor window and architraves are set in a quoined limestone ground. Six limestone <b>chimneys,</b> <b>capped</b> with Tusance entablature, are visible from the ground level. Two chimneys are located at the front and back of the house and a chimney is located on the eastern and western sides. The slate mansard roof has a limestone and metal ridge.|$|R
50|$|Mary Lambart Swale {{died at the}} age of 25 {{and gave}} the Toronto diocese a gift of 5,000 {{sterling}} to build a church. She requested that the church in the Gothic style, that the name be Holy Trinity, that the reading desk and pulpit not be placed as to obstruct the view of patrons, and that the pews were to be free for everyone forever. Along with the original gift she also gave a Font that can still be found in the church today. The Gothic style chosen for The Church of the Holy Trinity was the late medieval Tudor Style. The four pointed arch (also known as the Tudor Arch) in combination with the tall and narrow oriel windows are of Tudor style. The decorative <b>chimney</b> <b>caps</b> on most of the eleven chimneys are also in the style of Tudor architecture. The two towers flanking the west entrance of the church became a landmark of Toronto in the mid-nineteenth century and could be seen throughout the city.|$|R
