Because of the underlying spin liquid state, we can assume the existence of a short-ranged antiferromagnetic order for some range of parameters in the lightly doped case.

The <b>continum</b> limit of this model consists of two kinds of Dirac fermions which are coupled to the O(3) non-linear sigma model in terms of the gauge coupling with opposite sign of ”charges”. There is another kind of attractive force between these Dirac fermions. We show that the latter is essential to determine the low energy properties of lightly doped two-leg t-J ladders.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} how {{to model the}} toppling activity in avalanching systems by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The theory is developed as a generalization of the classical mean field approach to sandpile dynamics by formulating it as a generalization of Itoh’s SDE. This equation contains a fractional Gaussian noise term representing the branching of an avalanche into small active clusters, and a drift term reflecting the tendency for small avalanches to grow and large avalanches to be constricted by the finite system size. If one defines avalanching to take place when the toppling activity exceeds a certain threshold the stochastic model allows us to compute the avalanche exponents in the <b>continum</b> limit as functions of the Hurst exponent of the noise. The results are found to agree well with numerical simulations in the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld and Zhang sandpile models. The stochastic model also provides a method for computing the probability density functions of the fluctuations in the toppling activity itself. We show that the sandpiles {{do not belong to}} the class of phenomena giving rise to universal non-Gaussian probability density functions for the global activity. Moreover, we demonstrate essential differences between the fluctuations of total kinetic energy in a two-dimensional turbulence simulation and the toppling activity in sandpile...|$|E

The influence of the length to width ratio of a beam, subjected to a central concentrated load, on contact force distribution is also investigated. Laboratory model tests have been conducted on finite beams of different flexibility which rest on a granular subgrade.

It has been {{observed}} that the concept of tradition reflects itself in the works of Saygun as one of the main characteristics of composer’s musical identity and the view of aesthetics. However, the materials taken from Turkish traditional music have been used in a very personal way in the music of Saygun. The richness of the harmonic language becomes the overall platform for the presentation of these Non-European musical elements. This kind of creative approach to the usage of the materials of traditonal Turkish music gives the most unique sound of the piece, which forms a continous change.

The complexes were selective towards tertiary C-H bonds in saturated alkanes but were almost inactive towards secondary C-H bonds. However, they were reactive towards aromatic hydrocarbons and the second-order rate constants (k 2) for the oxidation of ethylbenzene and cumene by [Ru(tpp) O 2] (tpp = 5, 10, 15, 20 -tetraphenylporphyrinate) were 2. 21 × 10 - 4 and 3. 16 × 10 - 4 dm 3 mol- 1 s- 1 respectively. A kinetic isotope effect (KH/KD) of 11. 7 {{was found for}} the allylic oxidation of cyclohexene by [Ru(tpp) O 2]. The major organic products of the oxidation of alkenes in CH 2 Cl 2 -MeOH mixtures were epoxides and [Ru(tpp) O 2] gave a monomeric product formulated as [RuIV(tpp) O]·EtOH. or [RuIV(tpp) (OH) 2 ·]EtOH. Similar reactions with [RuVI(oep) O 2] (oep = 2, 3, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18 -octaethylporphyrinate) gave [{RuVI(oep) (OH) } 2 O] in non-co-ordinating solvents.

40|$|The first X-ray {{observation}} of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 5252 is reported. ASCA collected ∼ 4000 photons/detector enough to perform an accurate spectral analysis of this source. The luminosity of NGC 5252 is L_ X(0. 7 - 10 keV) ≃ 2. 6 × 10 ^ 43 erg s^- 1, typical of a Seyfert 1 galaxy. A simple description of the spectrum with a single power law is ruled out by the SIS data which shows a strong soft excess at E 1. 2 keV. The spectrum is best fitted by models assuming either partial covering of the central source or scattering of the X-ray continuum. The best-fit partial covering model results in a flat (Γ≃ 1. 45 ± 0. 2) power law continuum emitted by a source almost completely covered (at ∼ 94 - 97 %) by neutral matter (N_ H≃ (4. 3 ± 0. 6) × 10 ^ 22 cm^- 2). The detected iron line is remarkably weaker (EW ∼ 90 ± 60 eV) than normally found from Seyfert 2 galaxies.

The "dual-absorber" model, representing nonuniform (density) absorption along the line of sight, may provide an alternative explanation for the flatness of the spectrum, with no constraints on the Fe K emission line.

Methods: A six-basic-emotion <b>continum</b> with 30 morphed emotional faces across happiness-surprise-fear-sadness-disgust-anger-happiness was developed. A labeling task with these morphed emotional faces was administered to measure the ability of recognizing the emotional expressions. Results: A group of 12 cases with prefrontal lesions, showed a gross impairment of recognition of expressions across all 6 basic emotions (the correct scores for 6 basic emotions are 18. 41, 16. 58, 11. 08, 15. 67, 12. 92 and 15. 33 respectively, P < 0. 01). Case 1 (with lesion in bilateral hippocampus) showed normal ability in recognizing all emotional faces, but an obvious impairment of episodic memory. Case 2 (with bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus lesions and a very small lesion in the right amygdale) manifested a robust deficit in recognition of fearful expressions (the correct score for fear is 4. 67, P < 0. 01 in comparison with normal and schizophrenic controls) sparing other emotions except disgust processing (barely borderline different from normal controls). Many cases had shown that unilateral lesion in the amygdala, whether left or right, was not enough to impair fear processing. Although case 2 had a very small lesion in the right amygdala, the result of his performance suggested that bilateral cingulate gyrus, like bilateral amygdala, were selectively involved in fear processing. Conclusions: It is suggested that bilateral amygdala and cingulate gyrus be all selectively involved in fear processing (in parallel or at different levels), while the prefrontal cortex functions as unselective processor for processing of all emotions. It is also possible that hippocampus be involved in the episodic memory, but not in emotional process. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{investigations of}} electron swarms moving in an unbounded gas in electric and magnetic fields {{is a topic}} of great interest both as a problem in basic physics and for its potential for application to modem technology such as plasma processing. One of the major challenges in these investigations is an accurate representation of temporal and spatial relaxation of electrons. From a purely physical point of view, the knowledge of temporal relaxation is essential for {{a better understanding of}} electron-molecule interaction in short time intervals as well as a better understanding of transient transport phenomena in gases such as transient negative electron mobility. The correct estimation of relaxation times for electron swarm transport parameters is important in experimental swarm physics, e. g., for design of the drift tubes. On the other hand, from an applied point of view, studies of temporal relaxation play a vitally important role in modeling of low-temperature, non-equilibrium plasmas. As an illustrative example, the relaxation times of the electron transport properties are necessary input data for fluid plasma models such as the relaxation <b>continum</b> model. With these remarks as background, the groups at the Institute of Physics in Belgrade and James Cook University of Townsville have undertaken a program to understand the transient kinetic behavior of electron swarms under the combined action of electric and magnetic fields. The scope of this program covers a variety of hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic studies on the electron swarm relaxation by using a fully kinetic Monte Carlo simulation code and multi-term theory for solving the Boltzmann equation. In this work we study the temporal relaxation problem for the electron swarm in electric and magnetic fields crossed at arbitrary angles. Similar studies have been published previously for neon using the two-term approximation. We extend these studies by overcoming the inherent inaccuracies of the two-term approximation and addressing the temporal relaxation of spatial inhomogenities through a study of the diffusion tensor...|$|E
