5|$|In 1949 the Central Committee {{established}} the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI). It differed from its predecessors in several respects. It was responsible to the Politburo and its local organisations {{were responsible for}} their corresponding party committees, despite the committees' authority to restrict their behaviour. In reality, the CCDI was established to <b>check</b> <b>all</b> party organisations except the central leadership.|$|E
5|$|The first {{plutonium}} core, {{along with}} its polonium-beryllium Urchin initiator, was transported {{in the custody of}} Project Alberta courier Raemer Schreiber in a magnesium-field carrying-case designed for the purpose by Philip Morrison. Magnesium was chosen because it does not act as a tamper. The core departed from Kirtland Army Air Field on a C-54 transport aircraft of the 509th Composite Group's 320th Troop Carrier Squadron on 26 July, and arrived at North Field on Tinian on 28 July. Three Fat Man high-explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, were picked up at Kirtland on 28 July by three B-29s; two, Luke the Spook and Laggin' Dragon, from the 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron plus one from the 216th AAF Base Unit, and transported to North Field, arriving on 2 August. Upon arrival, F31 was partly disassembled in order to <b>check</b> <b>all</b> its components. F33 was expended near Tinian during a final rehearsal on 8 August, and F31 was the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. F32 presumably would have been used for a third attack or its rehearsal.|$|E
5|$|The only clue {{found at}} the scene is a Lucky Boy {{employee}} button. Mulder and Scully <b>check</b> <b>all</b> of the employees and discover {{that one of the}} clerks, Derwood Spinks, is missing his button. Scully suspects Spinks after it is discovered he has a criminal record. Mulder, however, believes that the victim's brain was removed by a proboscis, and suspects another employee, Rob Roberts, of committing the murder. Rob, who is actually a mutant human who wears a disguise to hide his true physical body, subsists on brains in order to survive. When Rob's landlady, Sylvia Jassey, is trailed by a private investigator (Steve Kiziak), Rob kills him and eats in order to placate his hunger, which begins to get more and more uncontrollable.|$|E

25|$|In 2000 the Gauteng Transport Department ordered PUTCO to <b>check</b> <b>all</b> its {{vehicles}} for roadworthiness. This followed a crash which left thirteen people dead near Pretoria. The accident, which also left twenty-seven people injured, occurred when a PUTCO bus {{collided with a}} minibus taxi on the Moloto road near Kameeldrift.

25|$|The working {{world of}} the 21st century is mainly based on Total Quality Management. This is derived from quality control. In {{contrast}} to Taylorism, by which products are produced in the shortest possible time without any form of quality control and delivered to the end customer, the focus {{in the 21st century}} is on quality control at TQM. In order to avoid error rates, it is necessary to hire specialists to <b>check</b> <b>all</b> the products which have been manufactured before they are delivered to the end customer. The quality controls have improved over time, and incorrect partial processes can be detected in time and removed from the production process.|$|E
25|$|Dean Corso (Johnny Depp), a New York City {{rare book}} dealer, makes his living conning people into selling him {{valuable}} antique books for a low price, and then re-selling them to private collectors. Corso meets with wealthy book collector Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), who has recently acquired {{a copy of}} the (fictional) book The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows by 17th-century author Aristide Torchia, one of only three extant copies. The book is an adaptation of one written by the Devil himself and purportedly contains the means to summon the Devil and acquire invincibility and immortality. Balkan believes two of the copies are forgeries. He hires Corso to <b>check</b> <b>all</b> three and acquire the legitimate one by any means necessary.|$|E
25|$|Billed {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} teams of all time, the 1990–91 squad became the first team in 12 seasons to go undefeated in the regular season (27–0). A perfect record of 18–0 captured the Big West crown and earned the Rebels the No. 1 seed in the West Region. UNLV also flexed its muscles in a 112–105 victory over then–No. 2 Arkansas in Fayetteville. The Rebels rolled through regional play with wins over Montana, Georgetown, Utah and Seton Hall before a showdown with Duke in the Final Four at the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis. Grant Hill, Bobby Hurley, and Christian Laettner kept the Rebels in <b>check</b> <b>all</b> evening and ended UNLV’s dreams of back–to–back championships and the first perfect season since Indiana in 1976. The 79–77 loss ended UNLV’s season with a record of 34–1. The team was inducted into the UNLV Athletic Hall of Fame in 2002.|$|E
