40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} objective vocal quality, vocal characteristics, and vocal habits in future speech language pathology (SLP) students and to evaluate the possible impact of a provided vocal <b>counseling</b> <b>procedure.</b> A comparison of vocal data was done in SLP students who had and who had not undergone vocal <b>counseling</b> <b>procedure.</b> It is hypothesized that counseling results in good vocal quality, adequate vocal performance, and appropriate vocal hygiene. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled study design. METHODS: To determine the vocal quality, questionnaires (Voice Handicap Index [VHI]), subjective (videostroboscopic and perceptual evaluations), and instrumental assessment techniques (aerodynamic, vocal range, acoustic measurements, Dysphonia Severity Index [DSI]) were used. Identical voice assessments were made in 71 students who followed and have not (n= 83) followed the vocal <b>counseling</b> <b>procedure.</b> RESULTS: The VHI showed the absence of a psychosocial impact of the vocal quality. Thirty percentage of the subjects mentioned hoarseness as the most common vocal complain. Videostroboscopic evaluations revealed normal vocal anatomy and physiology. A significant difference regarding the DSI value was found between the students with (+ 3. 3, 83 %) and without (+ 1. 8, 68 %) a followed voice <b>counseling</b> <b>procedure.</b> CONCLUSION: This vocal <b>counseling</b> <b>procedure</b> is added as a standard procedure when future students gain information about the SLP master program.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{problem of}} the study was to {{determine}} whether university students enrolled in a pre-service teacher training course and exposed to a group <b>counseling</b> <b>procedure</b> having as its major emphasis education in the affective domain could demonstrate a significant change in self-actualization when compared with similarly enrolled students who had not been exposed to the procedure. The investigation was designed to test the following hypotheses: 1. There will be a significant change in self-actualization in the group exposed to a group <b>counseling</b> <b>procedure.</b> The groups not exposed to a group <b>counseling</b> <b>procedure</b> will not evidence a change in self-actualization. 2. There will be a significant difference in growth toward self-actualization between the group exposed to a group <b>counseling</b> <b>procedure</b> and the groups not exposed to the procedure. 3. The posttest mean of the group exposed to a group <b>counseling</b> <b>procedure</b> will be similar to the mean of a clinically judged self-actualized sample. The groups not exposed to a group <b>counseling</b> <b>procedure</b> will not evidence posttest means similar to the mean of a clinically judged self-actualized sample. The sample {{of the study was}} selected from undergraduate and graduates in Oregon State University registered during the 1970 Winter Term for the nine class sections of Educational Psychology. The sample consisted of 103 students assigned to two class sections of the investigator and to one class section of another instructor. Student placement in the classes was determined by the computer assisted registration procedure. The investigator was the facilitator in the experimental group (Group I) of 30 students (12 male and 18 female) and one control group (Group 11) of 43 students (17 male and 26 female). Another instructor was the facilitator in the other control group (Group III) of 30 students (10 male and 20 female). All sections of Educational Psychology were coordinated under a special grant titled, "Student Centered Educational Psychology: An Experiential Approach. " The control groups received exposure to self-directed learning in and out of the class sectional meetings. The experimental group differed only in the class sectional meetings where they were exposed to experiential learning exercises. The class sectional meetings were two hours weekly for all three groups over a period of nine weeks. The experiential learning exercises were detailed for ease of replication. The Personal Orientation Inventory (POI) was the instrument utilized for the measurement of growth toward self-actualization or positive mental health. The instrument was administered under pre and posttest conditions to all three groups. The pre-posttest gains on the Inner Directed (I) Scale were utilized for the testing of the three major hypotheses by means of one-tailed and two-tailed t tests. The. 05 level of confidence was selected as the acceptable level of statistical significance. Findings for the three hypotheses revealed there was an increase in self-actualization for the experimental and two control groups which was significant at the. 001 level for all three groups; there was no significant difference in growth toward self-actualization between the experimental and two control groups; and the pre-test means were similar to a normal sample for all three groups while the experimental and one control group (Group II) showed posttest means similar to a clinically judged self-actualized sample. In the experimental group growth producing effects were chosen by a facilitator with the intent of providing experiences in the affective domain which would result in growth toward self-actualization for college students in a pre-service teacher training course. In the two control groups college students in a pre-service teacher training course were given the opportunity to direct their own learning and chose experiences which resulted in their growth toward self-actualization. The effectiveness in terms of growth toward self-actualization of the two methods seems to have been demonstrated. Although differential effects relative to the hypotheses were not generally indicated, some differences appeared which were related to sex, tutoring, and to growth toward a level of clinically judged self-actualized status in the case of the experimental group...|$|E

She argues that the program, while doing work under the guise of “good” and “recovery,” actually reinforced a kind of misogynist nostalgia. She explains that although it is fine for women to resort to a breast prosthesis if they wanted to, the options seems like a cover-up in a society where women are solely judged by and reduced to their looks. Lorde understands the “cosmetic” focus of the Reach for Recovery program as part of a general problem of sexism and racism. She also speaks of the possibilities of alternative medicine, arguing that women should be afforded to space to look at all options, and negotiate treatment and healing on their own terms.|$|R

The sample of the study consisted of 29 freshman students who entered Oregon State University through the Office of Educational Opportunity during the fall term of the 1973 school year. These students were divided among three groups in such a way as to insure a balance according to sex and ethnic group membership. The Tennessee Self Concept Scale (TSCS) served as a measure of change in self concept and the College Inventory of Academic Adjustment (CIAA) was used to measure changes in adjustment. The Group Behavior Rating Scale (GBRS) was used with the experimental groups only and served to measure changes in group behavior. These instruments were administered under pre and posttest conditions during the fall quarter. The total scores were used for testing the statistical hypotheses. Seven hypotheses related to the effects of group counseling and peers on self concept and academic adjustment were tested, using a t test, analysis of variance and covariance and a test for correlation. Hypotheses were designed to compare pre and post-test mean scores for each group in order to determine if significant changes occurred within groups. Comparisons were made between. groups I and II to examine whether changes occurred more fres,. quently with peers or staff counselors as the group fagilitators.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{compared}} the year-round effectiveness of three ten-week physical activity counseling strategies among sedentary older adults (n = 442). Methods: The first <b>counseling</b> <b>procedure</b> (REFER) {{consisted of a}} single 15 -minute contact with a Health Fitness Specialist (HFS) who referred the participants to existing physical activity opportunities in the community. In the second strategy (WALK), the HFS offered an individualized walking program, {{in addition to the}} referral. It was assumed that the structured format of this walking program implicitly supported participants’ need for competence. The third counseling method (COACH) involved a multiple-contact individually-tailored coaching based on the Self-Determination Theory. In this condition, the HFS explicitly fostered the needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness. Self-reported physical activity, daily number of steps, autonomous motivation and perceived need-support were measured before (pre-test), immediately after (post-test) and one year after (follow-up-test) the intervention. Results: Linear mixed models demonstrated significant time by condition interaction effects from pre- to post-test. More specifically, WALK and COACH yielded larger increases in daily steps and self-reported physical activity than REFER. Similarly, self-reported physical activity increased more from pre- to follow-up-test in WALK and COACH compared with REFER. Autonomous motivation mediated the effect of perceived need-support of the coach on physical activity, irrespective of counseling strategy. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the long-term effectiveness of both a one-contact individualized walking program and a more time-consuming need-supportive coaching, especially in comparison with a simple referral to local opportunities. Furthermore, it is suggested that physical activity promotion should aim at facilitating autonomous motivation. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is a preventable cause of disease that infects approximately 50, 000 individuals {{annually in the}} United States. Not all individuals are impacted equally and health disparities exist among racial, ethnic, and sexual minorities. Routine screening for HIV has been effective in certain populations, but widespread testing has been limited. National guidelines call for routine HIV screening among individuals aged 13 - 64 years seeking healthcare; however, implementation has been hindered due to barriers at the individual, health system, and societal level. HIV prevention counseling is also recommended for high risk individuals, but not required as part of routine testing because of time and staffing restraints. A number of HIV testing program interventions have sought to streamline testing and <b>counseling</b> <b>procedures</b> to combat such barriers. This review aims to summarize HIV testing and counseling programs in the U. S., the effect on individual and public health, and offer directives for future use of HIV screening.

40|$|The {{literature}} contains {{much about}} learning. But, {{what do we}} mean by learning? Learning is {{the process by which}} an activity originates or is changed through reacting to an encountered situation, provided that the characteristics of the change in activity cannot be explained on the basis of native response tendencies, maturation, or temporary states of the organism (e. g., fatigue, drugs, etc.). (Hilgard, 1966, p. 2) Effective counseling requires that the client learn. Even though client learning is essential to effective counseling, relatively little has been done to relate learning theory to the counseling process. Significant work in this direction has been done by Shoben (1949), Dollard and Miller (1950), Pepinsky and Pepinsky (1954), and Krumboltz (1966). The work of Krumboltz (1966) is the most revolutionary because it suggests new approaches to counseling based on learning theory and research, while the others mentioned are largely explanations of existing techniques in terms of learning theory. It is recognized that the lack of clear specified counseling techniques is {{due to a lack of}} application of learning theory to counseling (Ford and Urban, 1963). The need for this work to be done is urgent. Most of the counseling and psychotherapeutic procedures currently in use have virtually no research base for their existence. The research that does exist generally shows the techniques to have no measurable effect. The few effects that are shown are usually trivial. Of course there are many difficulties with performing adequate experimental studies with complex human behavior, but it is quite clear that we do not already know the most effective ways of helping people. For example, Gonyea 2 ̆ 7 s study (1964), which won a research award from the American Personnel and Guidance Association in 1965, showed that there was a negative relationship between the extent to which counselors developed the 2 ̆ 2 ideal therapeutic relationship 2 ̆ 2 and the degree to which their clients reported themselves to be improved. The correlation was a -. 14, not significantly different from zero, but in the direction that those counselors who were most 2 ̆ 2 ideal 2 ̆ 2 produced the least improvement in clients. Certainly evidence such as this should cause us to hesitate before preaching that we already know what the ideal therapeutic relationship is. (Krumboltz, 1966, pp. 20 - 21). Objectives The purpose of this paper is to provide a means for increasing the effectiveness of counseling. This will be done by providing a model for the counseling process that is based on learning theory concepts and principles. This objective will be accomplished in the following manner: (1) Relevant concepts and principles in some basic learning theories will be briefly reviewed; (2) A <b>counseling</b> <b>procedure</b> based on learning theory will be presented, including a discussion of techniques; (3) A method for evaluating counseling techniques will be suggested...|$|E
40|$|New rapid human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) antibody tests permit many individuals to receive test results and appropriate counseling at one clinic visit. Because currently used tests require significant time for processing, all individuals must return for a second visit for test results and counseling. Since return rates for the second visit are low, the more rapid tests present an opportunity to improve the efficiency of HIV counseling and testing. The authors compared the costs and effectiveness of the currently used <b>counseling</b> and testing <b>procedure</b> and a streamlined procedure {{made possible by the}} new, more rapid screening tests. When test-positive clients are given preliminary screening test results, the rapid procedure is more cost-effective than the current procedure. Since over 90 % of the clients in most clinics will test negative, the rapid <b>counseling</b> and testing <b>procedure</b> allows the vast majority of clients to be counseled and tested and to receive their results and posttest counseling in one visit. However, in the case where the goal of HIV counseling and testing is to focus only on infected individuals, if information regarding a positive result from the rapid screening test is not given to clients at the initial visit before a confirmatory test is performed, then the rapid <b>counseling</b> and testing <b>procedure</b> is not more cost-effective than the current procedure...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a pilot study}} that attempted to infect human volunteers with Cyclospora cayetanensis. Seven healthy volunteers ingested an inoculum of Cyclospora oocysts (approximately 200 – 49, 000 oocysts). The volunteers did not experience symptoms of gastroenteritis, and no oocysts were detected in any stool samples during the 16 weeks volunteers were monitored. Cyclospora cayetanensis is a protozoan parasite that may cause gastroenteritis with prolonged, intermittent diarrhea in humans. Characterization and magnitudes of risk factors associated with food and water consumption are unclear because the dose-response relationship and other host-parasite factors for infection with Cyclospora are unknown. To characterize infectivity, we performed a study in which inocula of Cyclospora oocysts were administered to human volunteers. The Study Stool samples containing high concentrations of Cyclospora oocysts and serum specimens were collected from persons with cyclosporiasis in Haiti and the United States. Informed {{consent was obtained from}} persons providing the specimens. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) institutional review board (IRB) reviewed specimen collection, informed consent, and patient <b>counseling</b> <b>procedures.</b> Stool specimens were homogenized with water and sieved through cheesecloth. Since Cyclospora oocysts must form sporocysts outside the human host before becoming infectious, the filtrate was resuspended in potassium dichromate (2. 5 %) and shaken for about 3 weeks at room temperature to induce sporulation. After sporulation (67 %– 94 % of oocysts sporulated), samples were stored at room temperature until further processing (2 – 3 months). Suspensions with th...|$|R
