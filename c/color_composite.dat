40|$|Carbon Black is {{inexpensive}} {{widely used}} industrial filler, but its dispersability in solvents/polymeric media {{has always been}} a critical point. As a result either surfactants or higher mechanical forces have been utilized to disperse it well in the media. First part of research was aimed at surface modification of CB to increase its dispersability in different solvents and epoxy that directly effects filler-medium interactions. Type and magnitude of this interaction differs with structure and surface chemistry of filler, and this determines the ultimate properties of the composites. For CB surface modification Thermal and photochemical procedures have been implemented. Excellent results regarding surface modification and dispersability have been achieved. Utilization of light, as a substitute of heat, for nanocomposite synthesis, has a foundation on photochemical reaction. Liquid monomers/oligomers are jumbled with a minute percent of photoinitiator, and then exposed to UV light. In a few seconds, the products inks, coatings or adhesives solidify. UV curing of <b>colored</b> <b>composites</b> has always been challenging because of light attenuation problems through <b>colored</b> <b>composite</b> samples; this results in incomplete polymerization. Second part of research was connected with UV-curing of <b>colored</b> epoxy <b>composites.</b> Certain techniques have been utilized, to photo-cure <b>colored</b> epoxy <b>composites</b> either in micron sized thin layers or outsized thick samples. Implementation of a unique method "Smart Approach" to photo-cure thick <b>colored</b> epoxy <b>composites</b> has fabricated promising results regarding polymerization kinetics and thermal / mechanical propertie...|$|R
40|$|Standard NASA <b>color</b> <b>composites</b> {{combine the}} most {{relevant}} 3 bands from the 4 MSS bands available. An alternate approach is to extract the principal components of the data by a linear transformation of the 4 bands. This approach leads to a low dimensionality representation of ERTS- 1 data with the least degradation, in the mean square sense, of the radiometric accuracy. The technique has been applied with success to ERTS- 1 MSS data for several geographic areas in California. For all examples considered the mean square representation error is less than one percent.

Topography {{was found to}} be the most important factor defining folds on ERTS- 1 imagery of northwestern Colorado; tonal variations caused by rock reflectance and vegetation type and density are the next most important factors. Photo-linears mapped on ERTS- 1 imagery of central Colorado correlate well with ground-measured joint and fracture trends. In addition, photo-linears have been successfully used to determine the location and distribution of metallic mineral deposits in the Colorado Mineral Belt.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. <b>Color</b> <b>composites</b> and diazachrome transparencies of ERTS- 1 imagery have greatly increased interpretation capabilities.

It is felt that a greater understanding of the effects of snow cover on vegetation remote sensing will enable investigators to extend capabilities relating to the mapping and identification of these resources. Highly reflective phreatophytic vegetation has been mapped and quantified using the MSS 5 and 7 bands and diazachrome <b>color</b> <b>composites.</b> Approximately 10 man-hours were required to complete the entire state.

50|$|Green, red {{and near}} IR are {{typically}} combined {{to make a}} traditional false <b>color</b> <b>composite</b> where the near IR is displayed in red, the red is displayed in green, and the green is displayed in blue. This combination is favoured by scientists because near IR is useful for detection of numerous vegetation types. Vegetation appear as redtones, the brighter the red, the healthier the vegetation. Soils with no or sparse vegetation range from white (sand, salt) to greens or browns depending on moisture and organic matter content. Water appears blue, clear water is dark blue to black while shallow waters or waters with high sediment concentrations are lighter blue. Urban areas will appear blue towards gray. Clouds and snow are white.|$|E
50|$|For those {{wishing to}} use the Apple IIc as a {{standard}} desktop machine, Apple sold the Monitor IIc, a 9 in monochrome CRT display with an elevated stand. The Color Monitor IIc followed in 1985. Alternatively, a 14 in <b>color</b> <b>composite</b> monitor could be used. A mouse was another popular add-on, especially since it required no interface card and simply plugged directly into back of the machine (MousePaint, a clone of MacPaint, shipped with the IIc’s mouse). An external 5.25-inch floppy drive, matching {{the style of the}} IIc, was also made available. Later, 3.5-inch floppy storage became an option with the “intelligent” UniDisk 3.5 which contained its own miniature computer inside (CPU, RAM, firmware) to overcome the issue of using a high-speed floppy drive on a 1 MHz machine.|$|E

Comparison of 9 x 9 MSS band images and <b>color</b> <b>composites</b> made from bands 4, 5, and 6 showing vegetated areas near Phoenix during the summer, fall, and winter seasons aided in definitely establishing that certain land areas {{were being used}} as agricultural land and not as rangeland. Agricultural land, which appeared to be fallow, idle, or not irrigated, often became more readily identifiable as agricultural land when comparing different images of identical land areas which {{have been affected by}} seasonal vegetation changes. Experimentation with the Bausch and Lomb Zoom Transferscope using MSS images of identical areas in the same spectral band from different time periods, with a quick flip method of alternately viewing the frame areas, enabled rapid detection of a major land use change from agricultural to urban use on the northwest fringe of the metropolitan Phoenix area. The best results in this case were obtained when comparing MSS band 5 images.

5000|$|For {{business}} and word processing use, IBM announced its Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) {{at the same}} time as CGA. MDA was much more popular than CGA at first; it produced a higher resolution text display in 80&times;25 mode, rendering each character in a box of 9&times;14 pixels, of which 7&times;11 were the character itself. This produced sharper and more clearly separated characters than the CGA's 8&times;8 dots text character matrix allowed. Because of this, MDA was the preferred choice for business use. Also, IBM initially manufactured the MDA card as a printer port/MDA combo card. This meant that users wishing to connect printers to their original IBM PC would have to pay for the MDA card anyway (initially $335), while the CGA card (initially $300) could be left out to save money. While including the CGA card and connecting an existing TV set for use as a monitor allowed users to forgo the purchase of a monitor, this was not significantly cheaper than buying a monochrome monitor (initially $345) and leaving out the CGA card. Also, 80-column text was almost unusable on <b>color</b> <b>composite</b> displays, and the IBM model 5153 CGA color video display that was required to fully exploit the CGA card's capabilities was even more expensive. Since a great many PCs were sold to businesses, the sharp, high-resolution monochrome text was more desirable for running applications.|$|E

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. The seasonal change in size of sediment plumes {{from the many}} glacial rivers which discharge into the sea along the south coast gives an indication of seasonal changes in melting rates of glaciers. Changes in area of lakes, particularly glacier-margin lakes can be mapped {{of most of the}} area covered by glacial ice in Iceland.

MSS <b>color</b> <b>composites</b> permit the mapping of five distinct vegetation types; forests, cultivated areas, grasslands, reclaimed areas, and lichen-covered bedrock.
