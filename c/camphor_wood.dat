50|$|With an {{elevation}} of 70 above sea level, the 7-story temple is a towering 11-tiered, multi-hued attraction on a more than a hectare of lot and accessible by separate routes. The temple's attractions include the Majestic Five Door Gate, Bamboo Garden, the Liang Thing Pagoda, 2 circular pools or ponds and the golden emblem of a dragon, the Bell Tower and the Drum Tower. The interiors of Ma-Cho Temple is filled with Chinese ancient decorations or art. Taiwan laborers helped build the building under famous Architect Thomas Diokno. The temple is adorned by Chinese motif of Taipei lions and dragons (<b>camphor</b> <b>woods)</b> and massive stones. Its original spider type dome awes the beholder with the interlinking wood carvings of saints (piling up {{in a total of}} 11 tiers). Statues of animals, the famous towering arch, and the meditation room all focus on Mazu's eyes, which are closed while her hands are clasped together at her chest.|$|R

50|$|Historically, {{the summit}} of the hill was a place of worship for the local tribal population. The rituals of these tribes, most notably the {{lighting}} of Makaravilakku, were taken over by the Travancore Devasvom Board following higher number of pilgrims visiting Sabarimala. There are also reports stating that there was an Ayyappan temple at {{the summit of}} the hill which was maintained by local tribes. It was reported that these tribal people began the ritual of Makaravilakku by lighting large quantities of <b>camphor</b> and <b>wood,</b> and subsequently quenching the flame using a wet blanket three times {{at the time of the}} annual festival. After the takeover by the Devasvom Board, a platform for lighting the flame was constructed in the place of the temple.|$|R

Then quantities of aloes <b>wood,</b> <b>camphor,</b> and pistachio-nuts; and lastly, a beautiful slave girl, whose robes glittered with precious stones.|$|R
6000|$|Throwing himself upon my neck he exclaimed, [...] "Heaven {{be praised}} {{that you have}} escaped from so great a danger. As to your goods, I pray you take them, and dispose of them as you please." [...] I thanked him, and praised his honesty, begging him to accept several bales of {{merchandise}} in token of my gratitude, but he would take nothing. Of the choicest of my goods I prepared a present for King Mihrage, who was at first amazed, having known that I had lost my all. However, when I had explained to him how my bales had been miraculously restored to me, he graciously accepted my gifts, and in return gave me many valuable things. I then took leave of him, and exchanging my merchandise for sandal and aloes <b>wood,</b> <b>camphor,</b> nutmegs, cloves, pepper, and ginger, I embarked upon the same vessel and traded so successfully upon our homeward voyage that I arrived in Balsora with about one hundred thousand sequins. My family received me with as much joy as I felt upon seeing them once more. I bought land and slaves, and built a great house in which I resolved to live happily, and in the enjoyment of all the pleasures of life to forget my past sufferings.|$|R

5000|$|To {{keep warm}} Lister starts burning Rimmer's 24,000 dollarpound notes and {{collection}} of books. When the fire burns low, Lister suggests to burn Rimmer's collection of 19th century war figures. Rimmer refuses {{and points out}} Lister's beloved Les Paul guitar would be perfect for burning. Reluctantly Lister agrees and asks for a [...] "moment alone". Lister then quickly cuts a silhouette of his guitar into Rimmer's <b>camphor</b> <b>wood</b> chest, snaps the cut-out {{and puts it in}} the fire. Rimmer returns and sees a guitar shaped object burning away in the furnace. Rimmer states that he has made a [...] "supreme sacrifice" [...] and as a [...] "man of honour" [...] he will lay down his war figures [...] "for the sake of friendship", after all that guitar meant the same to Lister as that <b>camphor</b> <b>wood</b> chest meant to himself. He then tells Lister exactly how much it meant to him and Lister feels guilty.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{outstanding}} lacquer objects is the Tamamushi Shrine from middle of the seventh century AD. The shrine is made of lacquered hinoki or Japanese cypress and <b>camphor</b> <b>wood,</b> both native species. While {{commonly referred to as}} urushi, since the Meiji period some scholars have argued instead that the paintings employ the technique known as mitsuda-e, an early type of oil painting, using perilla (shiso) oil with litharge as a desiccant.|$|E
5000|$|Among Rimmer's {{possessions}} in his <b>camphor</b> <b>wood</b> trunk are his {{nineteenth century}} replicas of Napoleon's L'Armée du Nord. Rimmer references Lieutenant-General Baron Jaquinaux of the First Cavalry Division when Lister picks the replica up. Lister comments that Rimmer {{is obsessed with}} war, half his books being about Patton, Caesar and [...] "various other gits". Lister references Road Runner in describing Rimmer's cowardly act in fleeing a bar room brawl. Rimmer references Newcastle Brown bottles when stating that Generals don't resort to violence. Rimmer said to Lister that he had visited Alexander the Great's palace in Macedonia.|$|E
50|$|The {{dramatic}} gate, or torii, of Itsukushima Shrine {{is one of}} Japan's {{most popular}} tourist attractions, and the most recognizable and celebrated feature of the Itsukushima shrine, and {{the view of the}} gate in front of the island's Mount Misen is classified as one of the Three Views of Japan (along with the sand bar Amanohashidate, and Matsushima Bay). Although a gate has been in place since 1168, the current gate dates back only to 1875. The gate, built of decay-resistant <b>camphor</b> <b>wood,</b> is about 16 metres high. The placement of an additional leg in front of and behind each main pillar identifies the torii as reflecting the style of Ryōbu Shintō (dual Shinto), a medieval school of esoteric Japanese Buddhism associated with the Shingon Sect.|$|E
5000|$|Funakoshi is {{considered}} a leading name {{in the field of}} visual arts in his country. Funakoshi's father was also a sculptor and soon he felt the same vocation. He studied in the University of Art and Design, from 1971 to 1975, and in the University of Fine Arts and Music, from 1975 to 1977. He started carving in <b>camphor</b> <b>wood,</b> in 1980. His works, usually depicting human figures from the waist up, have a great poetical effect, and are striking and distinctive. Funakoshi works this material in a personal way and leaves visible both the grain of the wood and the marks of carving. The artist carefully utilises the grain for modelling and leaves part of the head unpainted, normally the crown.|$|E
50|$|Kryten and Cat {{eventually}} {{discover the}} crashed Starbug on the icy planet {{and come to}} the rescue. Holly then informs them that there weren't actually any black holes at all. They were five specks of grit on the scanner-scope. Unamused, Rimmer then tells Kryten the great sacrifice that Lister made and how they grew closer. Just then Lister comes back in, looking at the floor, and walks over to the locker. He opens the locker, takes out his guitar and exits. Rimmer now realises what has happened and when Kryten opens the <b>camphor</b> <b>wood</b> chest there is clearly a guitar shaped hole at the back. He then tells Kryten to grab a hacksaw, saying they're going to do to Lister 'What Alexander the Great once did to me...'.|$|E
5000|$|Nichiren himself {{attached}} the greatest importance to his inscription of the Gohonzon and claimed {{this as a}} pivotal moment in his life.

50|$|Lady Norah Docker was {{appointed}} {{a director of}} Hooper and began a publicity campaign for Hooper and Daimler which included a sensational car built for the Earls Court Motor Show each year. The first of Lady Docker's specials was a touring limousine which was referred to variously as the Gold Car, the Gold Daimler, or the Golden Daimler. The car was named {{for the use of}} gold on all the trimmings where chrome would normally have been used, and for the 7,000 gold stars {{on the sides of the}} car, below the waistlines. The upholstery and headliners in the rear were made from gold silk brocade woven on a hand loom. Cabinets in the division were made of Australian <b>camphor</b> <b>wood,</b> chosen for its golden colour. The left cabinet contained a gold and crystal cocktail set, the right cabinet contained a gold and black china tea set with a gold-plated Thermos tea jug, and the linen tablecloth and napkins was kept in the centre. The divider also contained a pair of folding tables and a gold vanity set. Gold-plated radio controls were in the armrests.|$|E
5000|$|Among the few edible {{items found}} aboard Starbug are a Pot Noodle, half {{a bag of}} soggy smoky bacon crisps, a tin of mustard powder, three water biscuits, a brown lemon, 2 bottles of vinegar, and a tube of Bonjela gum ointment. As Lister looks through Rimmer's books they all remind him of food; Charles Lamb, Herman Wouk (whose last name Lister {{pronounced}} as [...] "Wok"), the complete works of Sir Francis Bacon, Eric Van Lustbader (arguing that food comes in vans) and Harold Pinter (Pint-er). As {{an alternative to the}} [...] "Mayday" [...] distress call, which he mistakenly believes is named for a bank holiday, Rimmer comes up with [...] "Shrove Tuesday", [...] "Ascension Sunday" [...] and [...] "The fifteenth Wednesday after Pentecost". In a continuity error in that scene, Rimmer is shown operating Starbug's distress call system, when as a hologram he should not be able to interact with the ship's controls. In another error it is not explained how Rimmer is able to smell burning <b>camphor</b> <b>wood,</b> despite being a hologram. Lister references the Ryder Cup while Rimmer compares Lister's bottom to that of two badly parked Volkswagens.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second and}} {{principal}} hall is the Mahavira Hall, or the Grand Hall of the Great Sage (...) [...] It {{is separated from}} the Hall of the Heavenly Kings by a large courtyard, featuring a raised lawn bordered with trees. To {{the left of the}} courtyard stands the Hall of the Five Hundred Arhats. The Grand Hall of the Great Sage is triple eaved and stands 33.6 metres tall. It houses, as is traditional, a statue of Shakyamuni, the historical Buddha. The present statue was carved in 1956 from <b>camphor</b> <b>wood</b> in Tang Dynasty style and coated with 60 taels of gold. It is the largest wooden Buddhist statue in China. At the back of the main statue is a statue of Guanyin, backed by a large screen that features the carved images of some 150 Buddhist personalities, including the pilgrims of the Journey to the West, Daoji, and arhats. Arranged along the sides of the hall are images of the 18 principal arhats, and other prominent Buddhists. The interior of the hall reaches about 30 metres, with a gold-painted ceiling featuring bas-relief images of traditional Buddhist symbols.|$|E
50|$|The shrine {{is made of}} {{lacquered}} hinoki or Japanese cypress and <b>camphor</b> <b>wood.</b> Both {{are native}} species. Attached {{to the members of}} the building and the edges of plinth and dais are bands of openwork bronze. It was under this metalwork that the tamamushi wings were applied in the technique known as beetlewing. Yamato Tamamushi that lives in the Japanese Archipelago excluding Hokkaido and Okinawa Islands. The accessories by the beautiful feather of a beetle were exported also to the Korea. The Thousand Buddhas are of repoussé or hammered bronze and the roof tiles are also of metal. Optical microscopy or instrumental analysis, ideally non-invasive, would be needed to identify conclusively the pigments and binder used in the original colour scheme - red, green, yellow, and white on a black ground. The range of available pigments, compared with that evident in the early decorated tumuli, was transformed with the introduction of Buddhism to Japan. The precise medium in which the pigments are bound is uncertain. While commonly referred to as lacquer, since the Meiji period some scholars have argued instead that the paintings employ the technique known as mitsuda-e, an early type of oil painting, using perilla (shiso) oil with litharge as a desiccant.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} of the vessel had started {{at the end of}} 2008 in a commercial shipyard at Suez, Egypt, under supervision of vessel's captain Josef Dvorský and ship constructor Daniel Rosecký (who are now co-owners). The main reason why Suez was selected for a construction site was utilization of traditional boat building procedures, which are still prevalent there. A wooden model had to be made first for the Egyptian builders, as was usual in the 18th century. The boat was then constructed according to this maquette. Due to the importance of the Suez Canal in global trade, high quality Scandinavian wood is readily available in Egypt. This wood was the most usual and favourite shipbuilding material in the Age of Sail. However, the keel and the frames are made of extremely hard and sturdy <b>camphor</b> <b>wood</b> and mulberry wood. Planking and decks timbers are made of Finnish pine tree wood. But nowadays, original Chapman’s blueprints are not sufficient to build a boat. Because of that, a 3D model of the boat was also made based on these blueprints. The virtual representation was then utilised to make even more detailed plans. A large amount of calculations were necessary as well (e.g. a stability assessment). Masts, yards, blocks, as well as steering wheel and cannons were made in joiner's shop of Vilém Pavlica at Valašské Meziříčí, Czech Republic. Dozens of volunteers from all over the Czech Republic worked since June 2009 and helped to complete the equipment. In December 2009, all the material was shipped to The following year was mainly in the spirit of 21st century technology. Boat’s engine, electric generator, water and power distribution were installed. Most of the work was again conducted by a joint effort of both experts and volunteers. La Grace was launched on 5 December 2010, nearly two years after the construction began. In the next few weeks the ship was at anchor, receiving finishing touches and fitting out; primarily the fitting of sails and rigging supervised by Viktor Neuman, the ship's sailing master and boatswain.|$|E
5000|$|The sound {{chamber of}} the qin is {{constructed}} with two boards of wood, typically of differing wood types. The slightly rounded top board (soundboard) is usually made of tong wood 『桐』, the Chinese parasol tree, or Chinese paulownia. There are {{many different types of}} tong wood, the names of which are listed in the Yuguzhai Qinpu: wutong 『梧桐』 (Firmiana simplex), baitong 『白桐』, qingtong 『青桐』 (Japanese paulownia), paotong 『泡桐』 (Paulownia tomentosa), yitong 『椅桐』 and nantong 『南桐』; the best is wutong, but paotong is now widely used. The bottom board is made of zi mu 『梓木』 catalpa (Catalpa ovata) or, more recently, nan mu 『楠木』 <b>camphor</b> <b>wood</b> (Machilus nanmu) [...] The wood must be well seasoned, that is, the sap and moisture must be removed (of the top board wood). If sap remains then it will deaden the sound and, as the moisture evaporates, the wood will warp and crack. Some makers use old or ancient wood to construct qins because most of the sap and moisture has been removed naturally by time (old shan mu 『杉木』, [...] "Chinese fir", Chinese Cunninghamia or Japanese Cryptomeria, is often used for creating modern qins). Some go to lengths to obtain extremely ancient wood, such as that from Han dynasty tomb structures or coffins. Although such wood is very dry, it is not necessarily the best since it may be infected with wood worm or be of inferior quality or type. Many modern qins made out of new tong wood (such as those made by Zeng Chengwei) can surpass the quality of antique qins. [...] Unfortunately, the supply of good wood to make qins has dwindled in recent years, causing a rush to make more qins. Paulownia takes many years to grow and requires a curing period of at least 20 years for the sap and moisture to be properly removed. As for old wood from old houses, there are not much old houses left after modernization of the cities and towns.|$|E

The main building at No. 26 Kennedy Road was erected as a Japanese school for 80 students.he campus on Kennedy Road was built in 1935. It was donated by the Japanese companies in Hong Kong and was the original Kennedy Road and the 12th Hong Kong Japanese School. The staff lived in flats on the top floor. A <b>camphor</b> <b>wood</b> tree grew in the courtyard on the Ground Floor level, which can still {{be seen on the}} multipurpose sports field today. In 1999 both primary schools reverted to full-day education. St. Paul's Co-educational PM Primary School moved to the site at Kennedy Road, and changed to St. Paul's Co-educational (Kennedy Road) Primary School. There was an altar off the main play area guarded by the two stone temple dogs which were used to guard the entrance of our present site until donated to a local Japanese school, and the Japanese logo of the Rising Sun was on the gable. The building became Government property following the Second World War. The AM school remains at Macdonnell Road and was renamed St.Paul's Co-educational (Macdonnell Road) Primary School. In 2006, the two primary school merged and renamed St. Paul's Co-educational College Primary School. The school moved into Wong Chuk Hang Nam Fung Path in 2008 (see detail in section Present).

40|$|Abstract- In this study, the {{residues}} of <b>camphor</b> <b>wood</b> {{were used}} to produce activated carbon by pyrolysis. The prepared carbon was treated by potassium dihydrogen phosphate and then used as a solid phase adsorbent {{for the removal of}} p-nitroaniline (PNA) from aqueous solutions. A commercial camphor activated carbon (CC) adsorbent was selected for comparison purposes. Liquid phase adsorption experiments were conducted, and the maximum adsorptive capacity was determined. The effect of pH, electrolyte, temperature, and grain size on the adsorption process was also studied. The obtained experimental data were fitted with the Langmuir and Freundlish models to describe the equilibrium isotherms. The kinetic rates were modeled by using the pseudo-first order and the pseudo second order equations. The results indicated that treated <b>camphor</b> <b>wood</b> activated carbon (TCC) is an effective adsorbent for the removal of PNA from aqueous solution. The maximum adsorption capacity of 160 mg g- 1 (~ 80 % removal) was achieved at initial PNA concentration of 200 mg L- 1 at pH= 7. 0 and 250 C. The presence of ammonium chloride proved to be favorable for the adsorption process. The Langmiur model was found to best represent the equilibrium data. The kinetic rates followed closely the pseudo-second order equation. The thermodynamic study showed that the adsorption was a spontaneous exothermic physical process.
