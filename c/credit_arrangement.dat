The export credit programs for several major agricultural exporters are described. These programs are compared to OECD disciplines for export <b>credit</b> <b>arrangements,</b> and the consequences of extending these guidelines to agriculture are analysed. None of the programs discussed would be consistent with the OECD guidelines. Since export <b>credit</b> <b>arrangements</b> have many of the same characteristics as targeted export subsidies, the same analytical framework can be used to analyse these programs. However, it is necessary to determine implicit subsidy values for the program. export credit, export subsidy, price discrimination, WTO, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

50|$|The act of {{exchange}} (whether a cash deal, barter, or a <b>credit</b> <b>arrangement)</b> reveals the {{form in which}} the value of commodities is expressed, accurately or inaccurately; the trading process provides various possibilities for expressing the value of products (using different price assumptions, valuations, currencies etc.).

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} welfare effects of {{different}} <b>credit</b> <b>arrangements</b> {{and how these}} effects depend on the trading mechanism and inflation. In a competitive market, a deviation from the Friedman rule is always sub-optimal. Moreover, <b>credit</b> <b>arrangements</b> can be welfare-reducing, because increased consumption by credit users will drive up the price level so that money users have to reduce consumption when facing a binding liquidity restraint. By adopting an optimal trading mechanism, however, these welfare implications can be overturned. Price discrimination under the optimal mechanism helps internalize the price effects. First, small deviations from the Friedman rule are no longer welfare-reducing. Second, increasing the access to credit becomes welfare-improving. Finally, the model is extended to study the welfare effects of credit systems when credit serves as means of payment, and endogenous credit constraint...|$|R
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{retention}} of title ("ROT") clauses {{is to ensure that}} where goods are supplied on credit, if the buyer subsequently goes into bankruptcy, the seller can repossess the goods. They are often seen as a natural extension of the credit economy; where suppliers are expected to sell goods on credit, there is a reasonable expectation that if they are not paid {{they should be able to}} repossess the goods. Nonetheless, in a number of jurisdictions, insolvency regimes or <b>credit</b> <b>arrangement</b> regimes prevent title retention clauses from being enforced where doing so would upset administration of the regime.|$|E

50|$|During 1966-1969, then {{president}} Marcos borrowed {{a great amount}} of money to finance his domestic expansion and reforms. This expansion in the government budget led to increases in the current account deficit and crisis in the balance of payments (BOP). According to the Political Economy of Growth and Impoverishment in the Marcos Era, the Philippines' foreign debt rose from $360 million in 1962 to $26.2 billion by the end of 1985. Hence, just over a third of today's $77 billion external debt was contributed by the 20-year rule of the Marcos government. During the early 1970s, the government aimed at reviving growth and establishing an economic stabilization plan as well as a standby <b>credit</b> <b>arrangement</b> with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).|$|E

50|$|This {{initiative}} to extend credit to all customers {{was made in}} 1969, during a prosperous period in US history, when Grant was expanding into new areas of the US. W.T. Grant hoped to attract customers from rival Kresge and other department stores. The low number of defaults on small loans at this time meant that the credit arrangements seemed a good idea, but {{the absence of any}} credit check, and the low minimum repayment terms were extreme, even for the times. When the economic expansion slowed in 1970/1971 the balance shifted and the <b>credit</b> <b>arrangement</b> became more of a liability than an asset. No decision was made to change or halt this before 1974, by which time the company's collapse was a certainty.|$|E

The US government was thus able to ship food to Spain as a humanitarian cause and this mostly benefited the Loyalists. Some American businesses supported Franco. The automakers Ford, Studebaker, and General Motors sold a total of 12,000 trucks to the Nationalists. The American-owned Vacuum Oil Company in Tangier refused to sell to Republican ships and at the outbreak of the war, the Texas Oil Company rerouted oil tankers headed for the republic to the Nationalist controlled port of Tenerife, and supplied gasoline on credit to Franco. This was illegal and Texaco was fined $20,000, but this <b>credit</b> <b>arrangement</b> continued until the war's end. The Republicans spent close to a million dollars a month on tires, cars and machine tools from American companies between 1937 and 1938.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the middlemen-fishermen link in coastal communities {{along the coast}} of southern Kenya and Zanzibar, and explores effects of reciprocal agreements and <b>credit</b> <b>arrangements</b> on social-ecological feedbacks of coastal systems. The existence and generality of such arrangements are mapped and their effect on resource use and ecosystem dynamics is then explored. Data show that <b>credit</b> <b>arrangements</b> are widespread and that fishermen are bound by reciprocal agreements and financial guarantees during periods of lower catches that provide short-term stabilizing social effects. These arrangements create incentives which disconnect resource extraction from ecosystem dynamics and impede development of sustainable use practices. The role of middlemen is seldom accounted for in fisheries governance. Scenarios for the development of small-scale fisheries in the region are outlined and the function of middlemen is discussed considering the influence of external drivers. Policies that incorporate middlemen are recommended to improve the governance of fish stocks and coastal ecosystems in East Africa.

Therefore, banks are essential when trade is intense and monitoring is limited.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{concern for}} any lender is credit risk - {{the risk that}} a borrower will fail to fully repay a loan as expected. Thus, lenders want <b>credit</b> <b>arrangements</b> {{that are designed to}} compensate them for - and help them effectively manage - this type of risk. In certain situations, central banks engage in <b>credit</b> <b>arrangements</b> as lenders to banks, so they must manage their exposure to credit risk. This article discusses how the Federal Reserve manages its credit risk exposure associated with daylight overdrafts. The authors first present a simple economic framework for thinking about the causes of credit risk and the possible tools that lenders have to help them manage it. They then apply this framework to the Federal Reserve's Payments System Risk policy, which specifies the use of a variety of tools to manage credit risk. The study also analyzes a possible increase in the use of collateral as a credit risk management tool, as presented in a recent proposal by the Federal Reserve concerning changes to the Payments System Risk policy.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated {{theory of money}} and dynamic credit. I study nancial intermediation when both the intermediary and individuals have private information. I show that money is essential in solving the two-sided incen-tive problems under the dynamic <b>credit</b> <b>arrangement.</b> First, requiring settlement with money can induce market trades that generate information-revealing prices to discipline the intermediary. Second, it is optimal for the intermediary to issue money that can record its own history of being used in settlements, and to require settlements be made with only money that has been returned to the intermedi-ary every settlement period. This arrangement e¤ectively reduces individuals incentives to deviate and allows intermediation to achieve e ¢ cient allocations.

40|$|We {{develop a}} model {{with money and}} credit where agents have {{different}} productivity to study credit and allocation. We show {{the link between the}} credit rationing, productivity and monetary policy, and study the distributional effects of monetary policy on the credit constraints, money holdings, and the ability to trade across agents. An agent’s productivity reflects his ability to replenish the money holdings and the ability to repay loans. We find that agents with low productivity consume less, produce more, and have less gains from trade in the good market. The cost of being excluded from the banking system is small for agents with low productivity, so banks offer less credit to agents with low productivity when credit rationing occurs. The monetary policy does not affect the effectiveness of <b>credit</b> <b>arrangement</b> in an equilibrium with unconstrained credit. In an equilibrium with constrained credit, inflation has different effects across heterogeneous agents. The borrowing constraints of agents with high productivity is relaxed more than those with low productivity. Hence, while inflation increases, the welfare of agents with high productivity is also higher...|$|E
