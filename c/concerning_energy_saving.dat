40|$|Although {{the housing}} {{shortage}} is an everlasting problem in {{less developed countries}} (LDC's), the solution for this problem should also satisfy modern environmental requirements. This paper analyses housing options that also {{comply with the requirements}} for sustainability. This analysis is based on the author's extensive experience in the field of low-cost housing in both Peru and Kenya and research at the Technische Universiteit Eindhoven. Three approaches to solving the housing problem are the upgrading, renovation and maintenance of existing buildings. This paper deals with the aspect of sustainability in relation to these housing activities. The point of departure is the Dutch national environmental policy plans (NEPP), which can be applied to other areas and countries as well. Integrated life cycle management can be realized through upgrading, rehabi litation and maintenance of existing buildings. Within these activities, the ~aste production and closing of the life-cycle can be achieved through re-use of building materials and components already in the project itself. There is little awareness <b>concerning</b> <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> or the efficient use of the available sorts of energy. The paper gives some examples for improvement. Besides that, the quality aspect should be given much more attention, when considering the reduction of materials use, energy use and extension of the service life of buildings and components. The conclusion is that (with some adaptations) {{it should be possible to}} introduce the concepts of sustainable building and construction in developing countries as well...|$|E
40|$|Buildings {{primary energy}} {{consumption}} in developed countries accounts for about 40 % of whole uses. Therefore, the European Union has released many regulations, <b>concerning</b> <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> issues; particularly, it has enacted Directive 2002 / 91 /EC regarding the energy performance of buildings, and its Recast Directive 2010 / 31 /EU, that promotes the Nearly Zero Energy Building targets, introducing more strict parameters in this aim. Furthermore, the latter Directive asks Member States to include within their national plans measures aimed at supporting public authorities to become early adopters of building energy efficiency improvements. In the same time, Public Authorities should implement effective examples of use of energy efficiency criteria in public buildings. Furthermore, energy consumption of buildings depends significantly on the criteria used for the indoor environment, as well as building design and operation, as clearly indicated in the standard EN 15251. Recent {{studies have shown that}} costs of poor indoor environment for the employer, building owners and society, as a whole are often considerable higher than the cost of the energy used in the same building. In this context, the school buildings play a key role. They should have high levels of indoor environmental performances. In the present work, the authors analyse comfort conditions of a school in Palermo (Italy) in order to stress attention on the building design weakness. The analyses have highlight that the requirements for indoor environmental quality and for energy efficiency may be controversial sometimes.

30|$|The growing {{scarcity}} of water has increased the dependency of urban water system on energy, both for conveyance and treatment. Access to energy can become a hindrance to the sustainable urban cities causing both shortage of water resources and water pollution. In addition, with growing climate <b>concerns,</b> <b>energy</b> <b>saving,</b> <b>energy</b> efficiency and energy substitution have become a common development principle {{all over the world}} (Friedrich et al. 2008). In this light, urban sanitation is a sector that can have substantial energy burden and can become important for power demand estimations in the coming years. This aspect is more important in developing countries where a huge gap exists between wastewater generation and treatment. In coming years, a large number of wastewater treatment-related infrastructure projects are expected to be implemented in these countries. So far, the main factors considered in decision making of such projects are the capital and operating costs, skills required for operation, and ease of technology adaptability under local conditions. Bringing energy considerations in such decision making will offer dual advantage of energy substitution and climate change mitigation which are vital ingredients of an eco-city development program (Mahgoub et al. 2010).

40|$|A study <b>concerning</b> <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> {{potential}} in prefabricated industrial buildings is presented, in which comparative energy calculation {{has been carried}} on through simulation models. According latest European energy directives and programs, retrofit and refurbishment of existing building {{appear to be the}} main target. In Italy the industrial building stock presents in most cases low comfort conditions and high energy consumption. After the 1980 - 1990 decade in Italy, there have been only few studies dealing with this topic to investigate and support the potential energy quality of industrial buildings. The study presented is based on selected case-studies, aimed to fix a set of general and effective criteria for refurbishment actions. One key factor for energy saving in prefabricated industrial building is the thermal performance of the envelope (walls, roofs and windows), through a reduction of energy consumption, for heating or full air conditioning conditions, directly related to thermal quality of building enclosure. The use of software design tools, like Autodesk Ecotect Analysis, Heat 2. 0 and Wufi Pro, allow to quickly estimate how different envelope assemblages affect the final energy consumption related to building size on a common input base for climate, indoor ventilation and occupancy profile. The works move from a statistic comparison of existing common buildings in Italy, in which most diffused building elements, like concrete prefabricated wall panels, are investigated to run energy calculations. The first phase results show average performance indicators of mean efficiency conditions in real buildings and to show potential benefits from various single or multiple refurbishment options, where roofs represent the most critical surfaces {{and at the same time}} the most effective surfaces for a retrofitting with walls...|$|E
40|$|The European and {{national}} standards <b>concerning</b> <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> strategies are nowadays paying {{greater and greater}} attention to the building construction area {{in order to achieve}} the ‘Zero Energy Building’ (ZEB) goal. Nevertheless, the available assessment methods are often used as tools to verify and assess the building energy behaviour when the design is already completed, rather than as tools for a preliminary assessment and choice of different design technologies and solutions. Not least, these tools can be not intuitive and suitable for many designers, especially for those working in the field of minor residential constructions, where they have not been used until a few years ago. To solve this gap, after analysing some of the available assessment methods, a simple and intuitive spreadsheet, named ZEBAPD, able to give a first preliminary assessment of the ZEB status, has been developed. The paper describes the structure of the tool: starting from fixing the system boundary conditions, it evaluates the building envelope thermal behaviour, the building services solutions and renewable energy systems. The tool produces as an output the building ZEB status evaluation. This simple spreadsheet can be used to evaluate the effect and the incidence of different technical solutions or building services systems on the building primary energy consumption, giving the designers a quick and intuitive tool to assess the quality and the effectiveness of their design choices for the ZEB goal achievement.

40|$|This work {{starts with}} a short {{introduction}} in which the energy consumption, proportion {{of different types of}} light sources, and procedures that have been introduced <b>concerning</b> <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> in outdoor lighting are overviewed. It is followed by a historical review and research related to aspects of the topic referred to in this work: the luminance method used for photometric dimensioning of road lighting, road surface classification practises, and mesopic photometry. The work continues with a study of road surface reflection characteristics. Road surface reflection measurements were made to study {{the current state of the}} pavement materials used on Finnish roads. Pavement samples were extracted from roads and the reflection tables of the pavement samples were measured. The pavement materials used in Finland are somewhat dark and diffuse and the standard reflection tables give an adequate fit for the degree of specularity but not for the degree of lightness. The spectral reflection properties of various types and differently coloured pavement samples were studied. The results indicate that light sources that have a higher spectral light output in the longer wavelength region, such as high pressure sodium lamps, are more energy-efficient in terms of light reflected from the pavements compared to the ones with a high output in the short wavelength region. In addition, pavement materials made out of recycled materials and local limestone were studied. Light pavement materials reflect more light than darker pavement materials, and energy could be saved by increasing the spacing of the poles for the luminaires or reducing the power consumption of the luminaires. The work continues with a study of mesopic dimensioning in road lighting. The luminous efficacy of various types of luminaires and the use of mesopic dimensioning in road lighting design were studied. The study is followed by a case study where high pressure sodium lamp street lighting was changed to LED street lighting. The energy consumption of the installation was calculated and mesopic dimensioning was used. The results show that energy savings are possible when mesopic dimensioning is used by reducing the power consumption of the luminaire or by increasing the spacing of the poles for the luminaires. The work continues by studying the differences in using the standard r-tables and the measured r-tables of the pavement used in the road lightning design on Finnish roads. It was found that the R 2 table should be used for road lighting design if the reflection property of the pavement is not known. The work is followed by a study of the use of light pavement materials and mesopic dimensioning. In this case the benefits of mesopic dimensioning are negligible when light pavement materials are used...|$|E

Burning fossil fuels as the conventional energy sources are the problem of global warming. Nowadays energy and climate are like two coin sides??problems, are confronting knotty conditions especially lying on economic dependency on fossil fuels and imminent catastrophic climate from the reason of global warming. It appears that current reactions are too slow for the environmental enhancement. One of the bottle-necks which have existed in the initial planning levels is {{how to take care}} of mass sectors of urban environment and their affiliation to the systematic energy chain. This includes some rising questions: - What kinds of spatial strategies can minimize their contribution to Green House Gas (GHG) emissions? - What is the main task for the sustainable energy plan in urban planning level and what is not? This project was produced after eight-months research concerning spatial strategies and energy consumption. Through a master plan practice and relative research support, we hope to answer the questions above. The purpose of this project is to build up the relationship between spatial planning and energy consumption in order to clarify the crucial decisions in urban renewal concerning greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It contributes strategies and approaches for the urban (renewal) planning in the direction of GHG reduction. Reduce GHG emissions through integrated plan Planning process can contribute to GHG emissions; through different strategies the correlated impact can be optimized. Urban renewal plan <b>concerning</b> <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> is needed. First of all, it analyses social, spatial structure and energy performance in local level; secondly, it takes the lead to develop urban-energy integrated plan according to local demands. Many relative factors will be taken into account during planning process. More integration on earlier planning phase will result in less incoherent program and greater impact of energy saving. Large scale GHG reduction would not be fulfilled without optimal process of initial program, action plan, measures and their implementations. The role of urban planning regarding GHG reduction Urban planning in new energy era ought to aware that energy adaptation be counted as separated items of spatial transformation. Proper urban plan or urban renewal plan can provide favorable environments to optimize energy saving measures. And in instrument package, integrated programs concerning spatial planning and energy saving should be included. Single-case adoption may be easily achieved. However, improving energy use pattern in broad scale for sustainable energy use in urban level needs integrated strategies. Spatial development strategy and proper planning can bring the city energy sustainability. Implementing strategies: Less sectors, more integration, strong impact Confronting complex urban renewal process, we have to select some strategies. Instead of developing many new schemes in different directions, strongly integrated and decisive strategy can avoid inefficient disorder induced by decentralization. In management level, complex energy chain should be sorted out in such ways that corresponding strategies are simple, efficient, applicable and influential in large scale. The strategies included in this project mainly focus on housing and transport sectors which occupied almost 50 % energy consumption in the Netherlands and they are the essentials in every urban plan.

A number of energy programs are being conducted everywhere, their sole purpose being to seek reduction in energy wastage and increase energy efficiency. As the field of energy management matures, so must the tools and practices available to ensure the energy required by an organization {{is used in the}} most efficient way possible. In the past, energy management practices consisted primarily of replacing inefficient equipment, then using various methods to estimate the savings gained. Now industries are coming up with various new ideas for process improvement, as well as inculcating them through practice. In recent years industries have been more inclined toward effective “Lean Manufacturing Systems”. Many have been highly successful at increasing efficiency, reducing costs, and improving customer response time. This has also contributed to improving quality, profitability, and public image; some companies have committed to reducing negative impacts of their operations on the environment. These practices have resulted in “Energy Efficient” Systems. These systems have caused incredible reduction in energy consumption, waste generation, hazardous materials utilization, and have bolstered the companies’ images as socially responsible organizations. This paper will observe the present energy scenario in different sectors, as well as state some facts regarding energy. Then it will progress with a discussion on where we are now in terms of energy and the progress in renewable energy. This paper will focus on how lean tools are helpful in energy waste reduction, and how they eventually improve energy efficiency.

The coefficient of performance (COP), the conventional factor, does not consider the actual operation of air conditioning systems corresponding to seasonal temperature changes. Instead it is evaluated under constant temperature conditions. In actual operation, the capacity and power consumption of cooling and heating varies according to outside air temperatures. As a result, the annual performance factor (APF) was adopted as the new criteria to evaluate <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> performance. Under this method, model cases were designed in order to conduct proper evaluations that are approximately equal to real operation.

In this study, the energy consumption and its characteristics of the APF and COP machines were calculated using the annual operating data of electric driven heat pumps (EHP) under equivalent load conditions.

According to the statistics, the energy {{consumption}} on construction contributes to almost one-third of that on the whole society. At the same time, constructing consumption makes up 23 % of the whole energy consumption on construction. As a result, it is of great necessity {{to find out how}} to control the consructing consumption. Based on the survey concerning the current situation of constructing consumption, the eassay puts up with the methods of classifying energy-consuming projects; analyses the source of construction consumption; builds a measuring model about energy consumtion in the construction phase using sub-project as research objects. In addition, referring to The unified national construction engineering foundation quota, we formulated energy consumption quota of these two sub-project respectively with an example of turkmen excavation and metal structure transportation. The research findings provide construcion enterprise with theoretical basis <b>concerning</b> <b>saving</b> <b>energy</b> and reducing carbon emission...|$|R

The industrial sector represents the highest consuming sector across all other sectors and accounts for about 48 % of all total  energy demand. This study is <b>concerned</b> with an <b>energy</b> <b>saving,</b> economic and environmental analysis of industrial boilers in Malaysian paper and pulp industries when applying the concept of fuel switching. It {{has been found that}} 11, 946 ton of CO 2 and RM 1, 872, 532 could be saved annually, when switching between diesel fuel and biomass by a percentage of 50 % for both instead of using 100 % of diesel fuel. Also it has been found that 7, 495, 640 kg of CO 2 and RM 923, 431 could be saved annually, when switching between diesel fuel and natural gas by a percentage of 50 % for both instead of using 100 % of diesel fuel. All these results represent high <b>energy</b> <b>saving,</b> environmental and economic benefits for a small developing country like Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of self-compacting concrete (SCC) {{is a huge}} step for a precast concrete plant, with many difficulties and challenges to overcome. However, it is a required {{step in the process}} of coming to a more intensively automated construction process with many advantages <b>concerning</b> product quality, <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> and preservation of the environment. While the properties of SCC are well-known now to industry, less information seems available concerning the contribution of SCC towards automation of the production process. Furthermore, the economic and ecological profit are agreed upon by almost everyone, but nevertheless are hardly ever quantified. This paper summarizes some information on different aspects. First, it is indicated how the application of SCC could lead to an almost fully automated production process, with advanced mixing, pumping and formwork filling techniques. Furthermore, an estimation is made of the <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> and ecological profit when a concrete plant is shifting its production to self-compacting concrete technology. Information on environmental impact (reduction of noise and vibration [...] .) is given as well. SCC provides a real contribution to the concrete plant of the future...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTask {{allocation}} is {{a critical}} issue in proper engineering of cooperative applications in embedded systems with latency and energy constraints, as in wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs). Existing task allocation algorithms are mostly <b>concerned</b> with <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> and ignore time constraints and thus increase the makespan of tasks in the network {{as well as the}} probability of malfunctioning of the network. In this paper we take both energy awareness and reduction of actor tasks’ times to completion in WSANs into account and propose a two-phase task allocation technique based on Queuing theory. In the first phase, tasks are equally assigned to actors just to measure the capability of each actor to perform the assigned tasks. Tasks are then allocated to actors according to their measured capabilities in such a way to reduce the total completion times of all tasks in the network. The results of simulations on typical scenarios shows 45 % improvement in the makespan of tasks in a network compared to the wellknown opportunistic load balancing (OLB) task allocation algorithm that is generally used in distributed systems. It is shown that our algorithms provide better tradeoffs between load balancing and completion times of all tasks in a WSAN compared to OLB...|$|R

By this, nations being a <b>concern</b> of <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> especially for electronic devices likes heating, ventilation and air conditioner (HVAC) system which commonly use at the domestic resident and non-domestic such as industry, service center and others. In {{order to reduce the}} air conditioner {{energy consumption}}, there are two ways that usually did by the engineer which called as active way that modifying air conditioner model and the passive way that applying of green building materials. However, this research objective identifies the suitable horsepower of the air conditioner and identify the energy consumption that applied in certain physical dimensions of space and occupancy level by measuring the indoor temperature of five selected lecture hall with a thermometer from time to time. Thus, the expected results may be shows there was more energy consumption needed for space cooling in the bigger lecture hall and higher occupancy level of people. At the same time evaluation of the efficiency and coefficient of performance of the air conditioner system has been made and suggested a new idea to reduce the air conditioner energy consumption. By this, the research may contribute to cost reduction and reduce the negative environment impact that comes from air conditioner system...|$|R
