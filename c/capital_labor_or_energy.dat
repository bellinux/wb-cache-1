50|$|Another {{difference}} between {{domestic and international}} trade is that factors of production such as <b>capital</b> and <b>labor</b> are typically more mobile within a country than across countries. Thus international trade is mostly restricted to trade in goods and services, and only {{to a lesser extent}} to trade in <b>capital,</b> <b>labor</b> <b>or</b> other factors of production. Trade in goods and services can serve as a substitute for trade in factors of production. Instead of importing a factor of production, a country can import goods that make intensive use of that factor of production and thus embody it. An example is the import of labor-intensive goods by the United States from China. Instead of importing Chinese labor, the United States imports goods that were produced with Chinese labor. One report in 2010 suggested that international trade was increased when a country hosted a network of immigrants, but the trade effect was weakened when the immigrants became assimilated into their new country.|$|R

40|$|Mainstream {{economic}} {{thinking is}} still {{characterized by a}} predominantly a-spatial theoretical structure. Though economists are able to model the impacts of <b>capital,</b> <b>labor</b> <b>or</b> technology on output, employment or prices at both macro and micro levels, our methodological tools are still not sensitive {{to the influence of}} geography on the way inputs contribute to production. Empirical investigations of the relationship between agglomeration and macroeconomic growth are still relatively rare in the literature. It is also a very recent advancement that geographical structure is modeled simultaneously with other variables in macroeconomic models. This paper introduces EcoRET the macroeconometric model with regionally endogenized technological change for Hungary. The unique feature of EcoRET is that it incorporates spatial structure into a traditional macroeconometric model by a regional block of technological change. The model can be applied for policy simulations on the macroeconomic effects of changing geographical distribution of regional financial supports.

40|$|This paper investigates how firms {{dynamically}} {{adjust their}} use of <b>capital,</b> <b>labor,</b> energy, and materials using the Colombian Census of Manufacturing. This Census contains data at the establishment level and provides evidence of a mix of smooth and lumpy adjustments and of interrelated factor adjustments. Based on this evidence, I propose a dynamic firm model that incorporates five key features: disruption of the production process and reallocation of internal resources when firms adjust capital and labor; partial irreversibility of investment; fixed costs of installing capital and creating or discontinuing a job vacancy; a convex cost component, aimed at capturing smooth adjustments; and congestion effects, which means {{that it is more}} costly for firms to adjust <b>capital</b> and <b>labor</b> at the same time than it is to adjust them separately. As result, when firms are hit by demand or productivity shocks, they decide to adjust either <b>capital</b> <b>or</b> <b>labor</b> alone <b>or</b> both, depending on the initial <b>capital</b> to <b>labor</b> ratio and on the magnitude of the shocks. Using a simulated method of moments, the study finds empirical support for the existence of disruption costs for <b>capital</b> and <b>labor,</b> the existence of convex costs for capital but not for labor, and the existence of congestion effects...|$|R
30|$|The {{essence of}} {{relative}} energy prices {{is the relationship}} among prices. Taking the definition of relative energy prices {{at home and abroad}} (Wei and Lin 2007; Yang 2009) 4 as a reference, we consider the relative energy price as a comparison between energy prices and the general price level from the perspective of inflation costs. Thus, we do not consider relative prices based on other factor inputs such as <b>capital</b> and <b>labor</b> <b>or</b> through price comparisons among different types of energy (Wing 2008). Moreover, regarding energy consumption, there are also two levels of analysis: total energy consumption and energy consumption intensity.|$|R

30|$|Aerobic- and vermi-composting proved {{effective}} {{technologies to}} recycle on-farm wastes into valuable manure. Aerobic-compost matured in around 50  days and vermi-compost in around 60  days. Thus, aerobic-composting {{may be a}} good option to handle large quantities of on-farm wastes as and when required without having to constantly maintain ambient living conditions as required for earthworms in vermi-composting. But, it needs more <b>labor</b> <b>or</b> <b>energy</b> for minimum four turnings required during the composting process. Both aerobic- and vermi-composting supported a diverse microbial population of bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes. Growth hormone auxin was detected in vermi-compost bio-wash. Also, both the composts produced had a good nutrient value and high stability. Thus, as per farmers’ requirements, both aerobic- and vermi-composting methods have a potential to be used as effective technologies to recycle the plant nutrients in on-farm wastes and help reduce the load of inorganic fertilizers. Its scaling-up will boost the economy and help in maintaining the sustainability of ecosystem.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a new {{approach}} to evaluating structural change of the economy in a multisector general equilibrium framework. The multiple calibration technique is applied to an ex post decomposition analysis of structural change between periods, enabling the distinction between price substitution and technological change to be made for each sector. This approach has the advantage of sounder microtheoretical underpinnings when compared with conventional decomposition methods. The proposed technique is empirically applied to changes in energy use and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions in the Japanese economy from 1970 to 1995. The results show that technological change is of great importance for curtailing energy use and CO 2 emissions in Japan. Total CO 2 emissions increased during this period primarily because of economic growth, which is represented by final demand effects. On the other hand, the effects such as technological change for <b>labor</b> <b>or</b> <b>energy</b> mitigated the increase in CO 2 emissions...|$|R

At the bottom of the network, there exists a large electronics cluster, and at its right mining, forest, and paper products.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} problem of constrained sequencing {{of a set of}} jobs on a conveyor system with the objective of minimizing setup cost. A setup cost is associated with extra material, <b>labor,</b> <b>or</b> <b>energy</b> required due to the change of attributes in consecutive jobs at processing stations. A finite set of attributes is considered in this research. Sequencing is constrained by the availability of two elements ??orage buffers and conveyor junctions. The problem is motivated by the paint purge reduction problem at a major U. S. automotive manufacturer. First, a diverging junction with a sequence-independent setup cost and predefined attributes is modeled as an assignment problem and this model is extended by relaxing the initial assumptions in various ways. We also model the constrained sequencing problem with an off-line buffer and develop heuristics for efficiently getting a good quality solution by exploiting the special problem structure. Finally, we conduct sensitivity analysis using numerical experiments, explain the case study, and discuss the use of the simulation model as a supplementary tool for analyzing the constrained sequencing problem.
