He instructed his negotiators to refuse the return of refugees to Ramle and Jaffa, but to leave open the question of Arabs returning to Lydda and to mention the possibility of an access corridor to Gaza. King Abdullah's demands were a Jordan/Egypt <b>corridor,</b> <b>control</b> of the Old City except the Jewish Quarter; also control of Katamon, the German Colony, Talpiot and Ramat Rahel in exchange for Israel having Lifta and Romema, all of which the Israelis had conquered.

40|$|A {{probabilistic}} {{description of}} traffic flow characteristics is given by stochastic modelling of traffic pattern generation. The basic idea is to derive a balance equation for generation and dissolution of traffic congestions. Transformed into an equation for formation of clusters consisting of jammed vehicles, this model covers traffic breakdown dynamics {{as a function of}} control parameters such as traffic volume {{at the beginning of the}} breakdown and discharge rate for congestion dissolution. From the balance equation the mean first passage time can be calculated. This time span delivers the statistics of traffic breakdowns as either a probability density distribution or as a cumulative distribution. The distributions can be used for precise definition of the road capacity connecting an observed frequency of traffic breakdowns with a probabilistic determination of the traffic perform-ance. The approach has some similarities with modelling the time to first failure in a life cycle analysis, an area where Weibull models have been widely applied. Traffic control systems with variable speed limits, keep in lane recommendations, and traffic actu-ated no passing zones - summarized as <b>corridor</b> <b>control</b> systems - affect the stability of traffic flow and directly influence the inflection point of the cumulative probability distribution for breakdowns. This influence is discussed theoretically by calculating the dependence of the probability distribu-tion with respect to the control parameters, especially with respect to the discharge rate and by ob-servation of traffic behavior with and without a <b>corridor</b> <b>control</b> system in operation. As an example several control systems on German autobahns are selected and the breakdowns are specified with respect to traffic flow characteristics at the beginning of the breakdown and the time duration of the breakdown. Based on the average daily traffic volume, the analysis enables traffic engineers and road designers to decide whether a <b>corridor</b> <b>control</b> system is worth installing or whether other traffic relief meas-ures should be applied such as improved incident management and higher service patrol density. ...|$|E

40|$|Urban traffic {{corridors}} {{are often}} controlled {{by more than}} one agency. Typically in North America, a state of provincial transportation department controls freeways while another agency at the municipal or city level controls the nearby arterials. While the different segments of the corridor fall under different jurisdictions, traffic and users know no boundaries and expect seamless service. Common lack of coordination amongst those authorities due to lack of means for information exchange and/or possible bureaucratic 'institutional grid-lock' could hinder the full potential of technically-possible integrated control. Such institutional gridlock and related lack of timely coordination amongst the different agencies involved can have a direct impact on traffic gridlock. One potential solution to this problem is through integrated automatic control under intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Advancements in ITS and communication technology have the potential to considerably reduce delay and congestion through an array of network-wide traffic control and management strategies that can seamlessly cross-jurisdictional boundaries. Perhaps two of the most promising such control tools for freeway corridors are traffic-responsive ramp metering and/or dynamic traffic diversion possibly using variable message signs (VMS). Technically, the use of these control methods separately might limit their potential usefulness. Therefore, integrated <b>corridor</b> <b>control</b> using ramp metering and VMS diversion simultaneously might be synergetic and beneficial. Motivated by the above problem and potential solution approach, the aim of the research presented in this paper is to develop a self-learning adaptive integrated freeway-arterial <b>corridor</b> <b>control</b> for both recurring and non-recurring congestion. The paper introduces the use of reinforcement learning, an Artificial Intelligence method for machine learning, to provide optimal control using ramp metering and VMS routing in an integrated agent for a freeway-arterial corridor.

40|$|This {{research}} has focused on developing an advanced dynamic corridor traffic control system that can assist responsible traffic professionals in generating effective control strategies for contending with non-recurrent congestion that often concurrently plagues both the freeway and arterial systems. The developed system features its hierarchical operating structure that consists of an integrated-level control and a local-level module for bottleneck management. The primary function of the integrated-level control is to maximize the capacity utilization of the entire corridor under incident conditions with concurrently implemented strategies over dynamically computed windows, including diversion control at critical off-ramps, on-ramp metering, and optimal arterial signal timings. The system development process starts with design of a set of innovative network formulations that can accurately and efficiently capture the operational characteristics of traffic flows in the entire corridor optimization process. Grounded on the proposed formulations for network flows, {{the second part of the}} system development process is to construct two integrated control models, where the base model is designed for a single-segment detour operation and the extended model is designated for general network applications. To efficiently explore the control effectiveness under different policy priorities between the target freeway and available detour routes, this study has further proposed a multi-objective control process for best managing the complex traffic conditions during incident operations. Due to the nonlinear nature of the proposed formulations and the concerns of computing efficiency, this study has also developed a GA-based heuristic along with a successive optimization process that can yield sufficiently reliable solutions for operating the proposed system in a real-time traffic environment. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the developed system, this study has conducted extensive numerical experiments with real-world cases. The experimental results have demonstrated that with the information generated from the proposed models, the responsible agency can effectively implement control strategies in a timely manner at all control points to substantially improve the efficiency of the <b>corridor</b> <b>control</b> operations. In view of potential spillback blockage due to detour operations, this study has further developed a local-level bottleneck management module with enhanced arterial flow formulations that can fully capture the complex interrelations between the overflow in each lane group and its impact on the neighboring lanes. As a supplemental component for <b>corridor</b> <b>control,</b> this module has been integrated with the optimization model to fine-tune the arterial signal timings and to prevent the queue spillback or blockages at off-ramps and intersections.

These habitats are {{especially important in}} urban areas, where they can help conserve native grassland species and communities in urban greenspace. However, they can also provide further footholds for potentially invasive alien species that already characterize urban areas. In order to implement power line corridors into urban conservation, {{it is important to}} understand which environmental conditions in the corridors favor grassland species and which alien species.

The results imply that old corridors on dry soils and steep slopes characterized by a history as open areas and pastures are especially suitable for grassland species. Corridors suitable for alien species, in turn, are characterized by productive soils and abundant light and are surrounded by a dense urban fabric.

40|$|Recurrent {{congestion}} due to highway bottlenecks is {{one major}} {{factor contributing to}} daily commuting delays in most traffic corridors. The resulting traffic queues often start from the bottleneck, and then spill back to further upstream segments to block their on-ramps and off-ramps. Consequently, the entire corridor [...] freeways and their connected local arterials [...] often suffers from severe gridlocks. To address such a critical issue, this research aims to develop an integrated control system, using both ramp metering and variable speed limits to improve the operational efficiency {{and to keep the}} traffic flows moving steadily near roadway capacity. The control system developed in this study includes a traffic state prediction model, a local bottleneck control module, and integrated <b>corridor</b> <b>control</b> strategies. The primary objective of the traffic state prediction model is to reliably predict the evolution of traffic conditions under the implemented control strategies, such as variable speed limit (VSL) and ramp metering. Based on the estimated compliance rate of drivers, the developed system with VSL is capable of capturing traffic flow dynamics – made up of VSL-complying and non-complying vehicles – and adjusting model parameters in real time, based on the on-line detected traffic data. The system’s predicted traffic dynamics will in turn {{serve as the basis for}} exercising a local and/or corridor integrated control. Grounded on the embedded mixed traffic flow model, the second component of this developed system is a local bottleneck control module, using both ramp metering and variable speed limits to tackle the recurrent congestion. This module is capable of selecting the activation time for each available control strategy – based on predicted traffic information – and determining the number of VSLs to be activated so as to ensure that the flow rate at the bottleneck segment will not exceed its capacity. The local control module can also activate the ramp metering in a timely manner to support the VSL operations within the target segment. The system under the local control state can also have the flexibility to select different control objectives based on the monitored traffic patterns. When traffic demand exhibits a sustained increase, the local bottleneck control alone may not be enough to prevent the freeway from breaking down. Hence, this study has further developed an integrated <b>corridor</b> <b>control</b> module, which can dynamically incorporate the upstream highway segments into control boundaries and exercise ramp metering controls to distribute excess volumes among different on-ramps. This will concurrently address both operational efficiency and equity concerns between freeway and ramp vehicles...|$|E

Traditionally, traffic speeds are estimated using aggregated detector data with a manually calibrated effective vehicle length. The calibration effort (usually through running probe vehicles), however, is time consuming and costly. Instead of using aggregated data, in this project, our data collection system records every vehicle-detector actuation "event" so that for each vehicle we can identify the time gap and the detector occupation time. With such high-resolution "event-based" data, we devised a method to differentiate regular cars with longer vehicles. The proposed method {{is based on the}} observation that longer vehicles will have longer detector occupation time. Therefore, we can identify longer vehicles by detecting the changes of occupation time in a vehicle platoon. The "event-based" detector data can be obtained through the implementation of the SMART-Signal (Systematic Monitoring of Arterial Road Traffic Signals) system, which was developed by the principal investigator and his students in the last five years. The method is tested using the data from Trunk Highway 55, which is a high-speed arterial <b>corridor</b> <b>controlled</b> by coordinated traffic signals.

Most congested networks, however, often contain more than one congestion spot along each route.

In this paper, we study the morning commute problem in such a network with certain special topological features - a freeway with multiple entry/exit ramps and a surface street grid with large capacities. For this type of networks, we investigated the basic characteristics of their optimal dynamic traffic patterns and the corresponding tolling scheme, for which a graphical solution procedure was also developed. In this network, we found that at system-optimum: (1) the aggregate traffic flow on the freeway has a staircase temporal profile, and piecewise linear dynamic tolls can be imposed on a subset of ramps to achieve it; (2) among all the off-ramps in use, the ones closer to the destination are being tolled longer with higher maximum toll charges than the ones {{farther away from the}} destination; and (3) among all the on-ramps in use, the ones with larger cumulative volume-to-capacity ratios are being tolled longer with higher maximum toll charges.

The aim is to generate an online traffic situation report. The system’s architecture consists of a positioning/navigation unit and a radio link to a dispatching center. From the dispatching center, a server is supplied generating a database for link travel times and specific data evaluation. First experiences are reported for data collection and data processing for online traffic control and dynamic route guidance. The cornerstone of the technique is a digital map that can be generated in a first approach from recorded positioning data of the taxi fleet. The process of map generation and feature attachment is presented together with an analysis of hot spots and critical sections. The approach is embedded in new developments for air borne and space born data detection and control technologies. These future technologies allow the establishment of traffic control systems without much infrastructure for data detection and are perfectly suited for the emerging and fast growing metropolitan areas in China’s east. The satellite borne recording technique can be extended to road infrastructures inventory and the vehicle probe technique {{can be used for}} transportation planning purposes, as well. The database can be used for deriving performance indices of the metropolitan areas’ vehicular traffic. Travel time analysis and mean speed time series recording anticipates the formation of critical regions and traffic hot spots. The online information helps not only for traffic control with <b>corridor</b> <b>control</b> systems and traffic signal control but also for incident management and patrol service optimization...|$|E
500|$|The NTSB {{issued a}} [...] "Safety Recommendation" [...] to the FAA on August 27, 2009. Because of the {{accident}} airplane's intended flight path, the NTSB believes that the pilot may have wanted {{to climb out of}} the uncontrolled VFR <b>corridor</b> into the <b>controlled</b> Class B airspace above. However, for reasons unknown as yet, he was not in communication with any air traffic controllers after he switched frequencies from Teterboro tower. He also apparently was not communicating on the Corridor's self-announce frequency.|$|R
25|$|For a robot to {{associate}} behaviors with a place (localization) requires it {{to know where}} it is {{and to be able to}} navigate point-to-point. Such navigation began with wire-guidance in the 1970s and progressed in the early 2000s to beacon-based triangulation. Current commercial robots autonomously navigate based on sensing natural features. The first commercial robots to achieve this were Pyxus' HelpMate hospital robot and the CyberMotion guard robot, both designed by robotics pioneers in the 1980s. These robots originally used manually created CAD floor plans, sonar sensing and wall-following variations to navigate buildings. The next generation, such as MobileRobots' PatrolBot and autonomous wheelchair, both introduced in 2004, have the ability to create their own laser-based maps of a building and to navigate open areas as well as <b>corridors.</b> Their <b>control</b> system changes its path on the fly if something blocks the way.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} vision-based {{approach}} for navigation of humanoid robots in networks of corridors connected through curves and junctions. The {{objective of the}} humanoid is to follow the corridors, walking {{as close as possible}} to their center to maximize motion safety, and to turn at curves and junctions. Our control algorithm is inspired by a technique originally designed for unicycle robots that we have adapted to humanoid navigation and extended to cope with the presence of turns and junctions. The <b>corridor</b> following <b>control</b> law is here proven to provide asymptotic convergence of robot heading and position to the corridor bisector even when the corridor walls are not parallel. A State Transition System is designed to allow navigation in mazes of corridors, curves and T-junctions. Extensive experimental validation prove the validity and robustness of the approach, and in particular the successful extension of the controller to turns and junctions...|$|R
