5|$|Final Fantasy Fables is a Final Fantasy spinoff {{starring}} a Chocobo in {{a setting}} which features <b>common</b> <b>elements</b> and creatures of the series. Music {{from the rest of}} the series is also reused. The game is composed of a number of minigames woven into a main adventure. The game was received positively by critics, who appreciated the originality and light-hearted nature of the title.|$|E
5|$|A {{survival}} horror storyline {{usually involves}} {{the investigation and}} confrontation of horrific forces, and thus many games transform <b>common</b> <b>elements</b> from horror fiction into gameplay challenges. Early releases utilized camera angles seen in horror films, which allowed enemies to lurk {{in areas that are}} concealed from the player's view. Also, many survival horror games make use of off-screen sound or other warning cues to notify the player of impending danger. This feedback assists the player, but also creates feelings of anxiety and uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|The album title {{derives from}} the Dutch art {{movement}} of the same name; <b>common</b> <b>elements</b> of the De Stijl aesthetic are demonstrated on the album cover, which sets the band members against an abstract background of rectangles and lines in red, black and white. The White Stripes have cited the minimalist and deconstructionist aspects of De Stijl design {{as a source of}} inspiration for their own musical image and presentation. The album was dedicated to furniture designer and architect Gerrit Rietveld of the De Stijl movement, {{as well as to the}} influential Georgia bluesman Blind Willie McTell.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{introduce}} an iterative {{scheme for}} finding a <b>common</b> <b>element</b> {{of the set}} of fixed points of a nonexpansive mapping and the set of solutions of a generalized equilibrium problem in a real Hilbert space. Then, strong convergence of the scheme to a <b>common</b> <b>element</b> of the two sets is proved. As an application, problem of finding a <b>common</b> <b>element</b> of the set of fixed points of a nonexpansive mapping and the set of solutions of an equilibrium problem is solved. Moreover, solution {{is given to the}} problem of finding a <b>common</b> <b>element</b> of fixed points set of nonexpansive mappings and the set of solutions of a variational inequality problem...|$|R

30|$|The {{motivation}} for the <b>common</b> <b>element</b> problem is mainly due to its possible applications to mathematical modeling of concrete complex problems. The <b>common</b> <b>element</b> problems include mini-max problems, complementarity problems, equilibrium problems, common fixed point problems and variational inequalities as special cases; see, for example, [1 – 35] and the references therein.|$|R
5|$|The case baffles Colton, as {{the only}} <b>common</b> <b>elements</b> in the murders are the lack of entry points and the {{apparent}} removal of the victims' livers with bare hands. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) looks over the case and notes their similarity to earlier murder sprees that occurred in 1933 and 1963. At the crime scene, Mulder notices an elongated fingerprint on the air vent, which he also finds {{to be similar to}} some documented in the X-Files. He concludes that because five murders occurred during the earlier sprees, the investigators should expect two more.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 2007, Rippy had {{completed}} all of the gameplay music, including end credits, battle themes, and ambient world tracks. In the game's skirmish mode, the music reflects the environment rather than the warring factions. To ensure that {{the character of the}} music changed depending on the environment, he followed self-imposed rules; one environment could feature guitars, but not piano, for instance. To musically unify each world, he added a short introductory piece containing <b>common</b> <b>elements.</b> In contrast with the skirmish mode, the campaign mode contains different recurring melodies for each major character and the human ship Spirit of Fire. Rippy's most intensive work period was January 2008, when he began writing music for the game's cinematics; by this point, he had been working on the score for nine months. Rippy finished the score by February 2008, and, after three months, all tracks were ready to be recorded.|$|E
5|$|For the {{original}} Final Fantasy, Sakaguchi required a larger production team than Square's previous titles. He began crafting the game's story while experimenting with gameplay ideas. Once the gameplay system and game world size were established, Sakaguchi integrated his story ideas into the available resources. A different {{approach has been}} taken for subsequent titles; the story is completed first and the game built around it. Designers have never been restricted by consistency, though most feel each title should have a minimum number of <b>common</b> <b>elements.</b> The development teams strive to create completely new worlds for each title, and avoid making new games too similar to previous ones. Game locations are conceptualized early in development and design details like building parts are fleshed out {{as a base for}} entire structures.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, {{sequestration}} {{budget cuts}} {{cast doubt on}} the USAF's ability to complete the Combat Avionics Programmed Extension Suite (CAPES), a part of secondary programs such as Taiwan's F-16 upgrade. ACC's General Mike Hostage stated that if he only had money for SLEP (service life extension program) or CAPES, he would fund SLEP to keep the aircraft flying. Lockheed Martin responded to talk of CAPES cancellation with a fixed-price upgrade package for foreign users. CAPES {{was not included in the}} Pentagon's 2015 budget request. The USAF said that the upgrade package will still be offered to Taiwan, and Lockheed said that some <b>common</b> <b>elements</b> with the F-35 will keep the radar's unit costs down. In 2014 the USAF issued a RFI to SLEP 300 F-16 C/Ds.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{standardized}} diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the DSM and ICD, were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as attachment therapy. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists. <b>Common</b> <b>elements</b> of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10. Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria. There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge of attachment relationships can contribute to the cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.|$|E
5|$|The Maratha Empire {{was founded}} in 1645 by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj of the Bhosle dynasty. <b>Common</b> <b>elements</b> among the {{citizens}} of Raja Shivaji's Maratha Empire were the Marathi language, the Hindu religion, {{a strong sense of}} belonging, and a national feeling. Raja Shivaji led resistance efforts to free the Hindus from the Mughals and Muslim Sultanate of Bijapur and established rule of the Brahminical Hindus. This kingdom was known as the Hindavi Swarajya ("Hindu self-rule") in the Marathi language. Raja Shivaji's capital was located at Raigad.Raja Shivaji successfully defended his empire from attacks by the Mughal Empire and his Maratha Empire went on to defeat and overtake it as the premier power in India within few decades. A key component of the Maratha administration was the council of eight ministers, called the Ashta Pradhan (council of eight). The senior-most member of the Ashta Pradhan was called the Peshwa or the Mukhya Pradhan (prime minister). The Peshwa was the right-hand man of Raja Shivaji.|$|E

5|$|The {{dress code}} of the British headbangers {{reflected}} the newly found cohesion of the movement and recalled the look of 1960s rockers and American bikers. The <b>common</b> <b>elements</b> were long hair and jeans, black or white T-shirts with band logos and cover art and leather jackets or denim vests adorned with patches. Following the example of Judas Priest, elements of S fashion entered the metal wardrobe of the 1980s and it became typical to show off metallic studs and ornaments, or for metal musicians to wear spandex or leather trousers. Elements of militaria, such as bullet belts and insignia, were also introduced at this time. This style of dress quickly became the uniform of metalheads worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} are very abundant in earth, both {{being among the}} ten most <b>common</b> <b>elements</b> in Earth's crust; sodium makes up approximately 2.6% of the Earth's crust measured by weight, making it the sixth most abundant element overall and the most abundant alkali metal. Potassium makes up approximately 1.5% of the Earth's crust and is the seventh most abundant element. Sodium is found in many different minerals, of which the most common is ordinary salt (sodium chloride), which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater. Other solid deposits include halite, amphibole, cryolite, nitratine, and zeolite. Many of these solid deposits occur {{as a result of}} ancient seas evaporating, which still occurs now in places such as Utah's Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. Despite their near-equal abundance in Earth's crust, sodium is far more common than potassium in the ocean, both because potassium's larger size makes its salts less soluble, and because potassium is bound by silicates in soil and what potassium leaches is absorbed far more readily by plant life than sodium.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Resident Evil 1.5, with which Mikami planned {{to end the}} series, was criticized by {{supervisor}} Yoshiki Okamoto, who {{found it to be}} too conclusive to allow for future installments. Instead, Okamoto proposed the creation of a fictional universe that would turn Resident Evil into a metaseries– similar to the Gundam and James Bond franchises– in which self-contained stories with <b>common</b> <b>elements</b> could be told. During a period in which the team made no progress rewriting the scenario, Okamoto was introduced to professional screenwriter Noboru Sugimura, who was enthusiastic about the first game's story. Sugimura was initially consulted on a trial basis, but Okamoto was impressed by the ease with which the writer came up with solutions to the problems that plagued the script, and soon asked him to compose the entire scenario for Resident Evil 2. One fundamental modification to the story was the reworking of Elza Walker into Claire Redfield, in order to introduce a connection to the plot of the first game. To fulfill Capcom's sales plan of two million copies, director Kamiya tried to attract new customers with a more ostentatious and Hollywood-like story presentation. As Okamoto did not want to simply enforce the new direction, he had Sugimura discuss the plot revisions with Mikami and the development staff. The planners redesigned the game from the ground up to fit the changes, and the programmers and other remaining members of the team were sent to work on Resident Evil Director's Cut, which was shipped with a playable preview disc of the new Resident Evil 2 version in order to promote the sequel and to apologize to the players for its belated release.|$|E

Using this result, we consider the problem of finding a <b>common</b> <b>element</b> of the set of fixed points of a nonexpansive mapping and the set of zeros of an inverse-strongly-monotone mapping, the fixed point problem and the classical variational inequality problem. Our results improve and extend the corresponding results announced by many others. 1...|$|R
