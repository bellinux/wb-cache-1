5000|$|In recent years, the {{technique}} of <b>cloning</b> <b>whole</b> <b>organisms</b> has been developed in mammals, allowing almost identical genetic clones of an animal to be produced. One method of doing this is called [...] "somatic cell nuclear transfer" [...] and involves removing the nucleus from a somatic cell, usually a skin cell. This nucleus contains all of the genetic information needed to produce the organism it was removed from. This nucleus is then injected into an ovum {{of the same species}} which has had its own genetic material removed. The ovum now no longer needs to be fertilized, because it contains the correct amount of genetic material (a diploid number of chromosomes). In theory, the ovum can be implanted into the uterus of a same-species animal and allowed to develop. The resulting animal will be a nearly genetically identical clone to the animal from which the nucleus was taken. The only difference is caused by any mitochondrial DNA that is retained in the ovum, which is different from the cell that donated the nucleus. In practice, this technique has so far been problematic, although {{there have been a few}} high-profile successes, such as Dolly the Sheep and, more recently, Snuppy, the first cloned dog.Somatic cells have also been collected in the practice of cryoconservation of animal genetic resources as a means of conserving animal genetic material, including to clone livestock.|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of nanotechnology in biological research {{is beginning to}} have a major impact leading to the development of new types of tools for human health. One focus of nanobiotechnology is the development of nanoparticle-based formulations for use in drug or gene delivery systems. However most of the nano probes currently in use have varying levels of toxicity in cells or <b>whole</b> <b>organisms</b> and therefore are not suitable for in vivo application or long-term use. Here we test the potential of a novel silica based nanoparticle (organically modified silica, ORMOSIL) in living neurons within a <b>whole</b> <b>organism.</b> We show that feeding ORMOSIL nanoparticles to Drosophila has no effect on viability. ORMOSIL nanoparticles penetrate into living brains, neuronal cell bodies and axonal projections. In the neuronal cell body, nanoparticles are present in the cytoplasm, but not in the nucleus. Strikingly, incorporation of ORMOSIL nanoparticles into the brain did not induce aberrant neuronal death or interfered with normal neuronal processes. Our results in Drosophila indicate that these novel silica based nanoparticles are biocompatible and not toxic to <b>whole</b> <b>organisms,</b> and has potential for the development of long-term applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In vitro {{systems have}} {{inherent}} limitations {{in their ability}} to model <b>whole</b> <b>organism</b> gene responses, which must be identified and appropriately considered when developing predictive biomarkers of in vivo toxicity. Systematic comparison of in vitro and in vivo temporal gene expression profiles were conducted to assess the ability of Hepa 1 c 1 c 7 mouse hepatoma cells to model hepatic responses in C 57 BL/ 6 mice following treatment with 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo- p -dioxin (TCDD). Results Gene expression analysis and functional gene annotation indicate that Hepa 1 c 1 c 7 cells appropriately modeled the induction of xenobiotic metabolism genes in vivo. However, responses associated with cell cycle progression and proliferation were unique to Hepa 1 c 1 c 7 cells, consistent with the cell cycle arrest effects of TCDD on rapidly dividing cells. In contrast, lipid metabolism and immune responses, representative of <b>whole</b> <b>organism</b> effects in vivo, were not replicated in Hepa 1 c 1 c 7 cells. Conclusion These results identified inherent differences in TCDD-mediated gene expression responses between these models and highlighted the limitations of in vitro systems in modeling <b>whole</b> <b>organism</b> responses, and additionally identified potential predictive biomarkers of toxicity. </p...|$|R
40|$|Larvae and {{isolated}} fat body {{cells of the}} freeze-tolerant Heleomyza borealis (Diptera, Heleomyzidae) were cooled to sub-zero temperatures between - 5 and - 40 °C at 0. 1 °C min- 1 and then rewarmed at the same rate. Survival of the <b>whole</b> <b>organism,</b> cells cooled in vitro and cells cooled in vivo were assessed using two fluorescent viability stains. The whole animal supercooling point distribution was bimodal, the two groups having means of - 2. 3 and - 9. 7 °C, suggesting a deficiency of potent ice-nucleating agents in the latter. <b>Whole</b> <b>organism</b> survival declined rapidly below - 30 °C. Survival of cells cooled within the organism remained in excess of 95 % above - 25 °C and approached 80 % at - 35 °C, whereas the survival of cells cooled in vitro (isolated cells) declined rapidly at - 20, reaching 45 % at - 40 °C. The reduced survival of isolated cells is attributed to protective factors within the extra-cellular fluid or tissue structure of the larvae. The pattern of cell survival suggests membrane rupture arising from shrinkage {{as the cause of}} cell death, whereas the pattern of <b>whole</b> <b>organism</b> survival is indicative of intra-cellular ice formation or failure of chill injury protective mechanisms at a specific temperature causing death of the organism...|$|R
