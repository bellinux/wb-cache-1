40|$|Mitochondria were {{isolated}} from the heart and skeletal muscle of rats treated with three consecutive daily doses of 100 000 i. u. of <b>calciol</b> (cholecalciferol; 'vitamin D 3 '). On the fourth day after the last dose, cardiac necrosis developed. At that time mitochondria isolated from heart displayed a 10 -fold higher Ca 2 + content and a 6 -fold lower respiratory rate with pyruvate-plus-malate as substrate {{as well as with}} other NAD-dependent substrates. No decrease in respiratory rate with succinate as substrate was observed. EDTA (5 mM) added to the medium during the isolation procedure restored both the high respiratory rate with pyruvate + malate and the low Ca 2 + content of the heart mitochondria. The addition of 1 mM-CaCl 2 to the medium in which a healthy (control) rat heart had been homogenized caused the same impairment of the mitochondria as did <b>calciol</b> treatment of the animals. No changes of mitochondria isolated from skeletal muscle were observed in rats treated with <b>calciol.</b> It is concluded that the heart mitochondria in vivo fail to accumulate Ca 2 + from the cardiac cell overloaded with Ca 2 + as the consequence of <b>calciol</b> treatment. Mitochondrial Ca 2 + accumulation occurs during the isolation procedure unless an appropriate amount of chelating agent is added to the homogenization medium. The implication of these findings for the biochemical sequence of events in the calciol-induced cardiac necrosis is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The photoproduction {{of vitamin}} D {{in the skin}} was {{essential}} for the evolutionary development of terrestrial vertebrates. During exposure to sunlight, previtamin D 3 formed in the skin is isomerized to vitamin D 3 (<b>calciol)</b> by a temperature-dependent process. Since early land vertebrates were poikilothermic, the relatively slow conversion of previtamin D 3 to vitamin D 3 at ambient temperature put them at serious risk for developing vitamin D deficiency, thus leading to a poorly mineralized skeleton that could have ultimately halted further evolutionary development of vertebrates on land. We evaluated the rate of isomerization of previtamin D 3 to vitamin D 3 in the skin of iguanas and found the isomerization rate was enhanced by 1100 % and 1700 % at 25 degrees C and 5 degrees C, respectively. It {{is likely that the}} membrane entrapment of previtamin D 3 in its s-cis,s-cis conformation is responsible for the markedly enhanced conversion of previtamin D 3 to vitamin D 3. The membrane-enhanced production of vitamin D 3 ensures the critical supply of vitamin D 3 to poikilothermic animals such as iguanas...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Technical {{improvements}} {{have been}} applied to reduce the time required for the determination of calcidiol and calcitriol in serum or plasma. The modifications {{include the use of}} Sep-Pak CIS cartridges for the extraction of <b>calciol</b> metabolites from serum instead of a classical liquid/liquid extraction, a considerable shortening of the HPLC purification time compared with our previously described method, and the application of HPLC with UV detection at 254 nm of calcidiol {{as an alternative to the}} usual competitive protein binding methods. In none of the 199 samples where calcidiol was determined by HPLC did we observe a detectable peak of ercalcidiol. Quantitation of calcidiol by HPLC and competitive protein binding assay was compared in 5 series of assays. The correlation between the two methods was 0. 99. The average slope of the linear regression line when the HPLC values were plotted versus the competitive protein binding values was 1. 14. The average intercept was 0. 19 nmol/ 1. The mean within-run coefficient of variation for calcidiol in these series was 5 % for the competitive protein binding method, and 4 % for the HPLC method. Between-run coefficients of variation were 6 % and 12 % for the competitive protein binding and for the HPLC method, respectively. Within-run and between-run coefficients of variation for calcitriol were 6 % and 15 %, respectively...|$|E
