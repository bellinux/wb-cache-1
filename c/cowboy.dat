40|$|In this ethnographic study I use queer {{theory to}} {{consider}} how black <b>cowboys</b> {{interact with each other}} to produce counter or micro-narratives about Black male pathologies and socialization in multiple masculinities. Queer theory provides a model to analyze the socialcultural significance of considering the intersection of race and gender as constructed binaries without focusing on sexuality. The lack of information about Black <b>cowboys</b> from other disciplines creates a peculiar position regarding notions, representations, and understandings about the racially signified <b>cowboys</b> in three ways. First, Black <b>cowboys?</b> relegation to the past leaves contemporary Black <b>cowboys</b> nearly invisible. Second, dominant narratives about notable Black <b>cowboys</b> are written from a particular historical perspective. This perspective suggests that Black <b>cowboys</b> are a ?thing of the past? and extinct figures in American society who were largely absent in the American west except as they proved to possess exceptional ?<b>cowboying?</b> abilities. Finally, Black <b>cowboys?</b> roles and positionality within American history and sport, via rodeo, performs a limited function towards inserting and increasing awareness of alternative representations of (Black) <b>cowboys</b> and their masculinities in the contemporary moment...|$|R
