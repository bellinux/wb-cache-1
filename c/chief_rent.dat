50|$|In the United Kingdom, a {{rentcharge}} is {{an annual}} sum {{paid by the}} owner of freehold land (terre-tenant) to {{the owner of the}} rentcharge (rentcharger), a person who need have no other legal interest in the land. They are often known as <b>chief</b> <b>rents</b> in the north west of England but the term ground rent is used {{in many parts of the}} country to refer to either a rentcharge or a rent payable on leasehold land. This is confusing as a true ground rent is a sum payable in relation to land held under a lease. As a result, it is important to know the status of the land for which, an annual sum is paid.|$|R

Richard Duke was MP for Weymouth in 1545, for Dartmouth in 1547 and Sheriff of Devon in 1563-64. His position as Clerk of the Court of Augmentations from its inception in 1536 to 1554 gave him the opportunity of buying many lands of dissolved monasteries.

5000|$|In 1703 Sir Edward Hungerford {{sold the}} Culme estates {{inherited}} {{from his wife}} to John IV Courtenay (died 1724) of Molland. It was thus an extraordinary coincidence that the Courtenay family acquired both the Domesday Book manors of Molland {{from members of the}} Hungerford family. It is generally said of Hungerford that his own extravagance was his downfall, but it was claimed by others that his huge debts were inherited from his own father Anthony Hungerford and from his father-in-law Sir John Hele of Wembury, who had incurred them during the Civil War supporting the Royalist cause. Indeed an Act of Parliament mentioning these reasons was obtained by Hungerford in 1675/6 specifically allowing him to sell the manors inherited from Hele. The acquisition of Molland Champson was initially as a year's lease [...] as the following catalogued deed dated 8 March 1702/3 relates:Lease for a year from John Pollexfen of Wembury, Devon, esq., Sir Edward Hungerford, knt. and others to John Courtenay of West Molland esq. of 2 messuages called Great and Little Champson in Molland, messuages called South Lishwell, East Gatcombe, Whiteleigh, North Lishwell, and Middle Champson, 3 messuages called Wood, Catts and Pipers and 2 water mills called Wade Mills, all in Molland; cottages called Vicars Cott, and messuages called Harpson and West Hole in Knowstone; a messuage called Swincombe and <b>chief</b> <b>rent</b> from a messuage called Ditchett in Rose Ash; 3 messuages in South Molton; perpetual advowson of Molland and Knowstone, and the manor of Molland Champson alias Champeaux.

50|$|In 1812, {{the family}} leased the estate to the Ropers and removed their {{valuable}} possessions to Loftus Hall in Wexford. The lands and castle were then used for dairy farming {{and fell into}} disrepair. To quote a contemporary account from 1838:Crossing the Dodder by a ford, and proceeding along its southern bank towards Rathfarnham, a splendid gateway at left, accounted among the best productions of that species of architecture in Ireland, invites the tourist to explore the once beautiful grounds of Rathfarnham Castle, but they are now all eloquently waste, the undulating hills covered with rank herbage, the rivulet stagnant and sedgy, the walks scarce traceable, the ice-houses open to the prying sun, the fish-pond clogged with weeds, while the mouldering architecture of the castle, and the crumbling, unsightly offices in its immediate vicinity,…The castle, so long the residence of the Loftus family, and still {{the property of the}} Marquis of Ely, subject, however, to a small <b>chief</b> <b>rent</b> to Mr. Conolly, is an extensive fabric,.....The great hall is entered from a terrace, by a portico of eight Doric columns, which support a dome, painted in fresco with the signs of the Zodiac and other devices. This room was ornamented with antique and modern busts, placed on pedestals of variegated marble, and has three windows of stained gloss, in one of which is an escutcheon of the Loftus arms, with quarterings finely executed. Several other apartments exhibited considerable splendour of arrangement, and contained, until lately, numerous family portraits, and a valuable collection of paintings by ancient masters. But, when it is mentioned, that this structure has been for years a public dairy, and the grounds to the extent of 300 acre converted to its uses, some notion may be formed of their altered condition.|$|E
