60|$|And so we had. We {{would spend}} whole {{days on the}} wharves, all bustle and excitement, {{sometimes}} seated on the capstan of the Sprightly Bess or perched in the nettings of the Oriole, of which ship old Stanwix was now captain. He had grown gray in Mr. Carvel's service, and good Mrs. Stanwix was long since dead. Often we would mount together on the little horse Captain Daniel had given me, Dorothy on a pillion behind, to go with my grandfather to inspect the farm. Mr. Starkie, the overseer, would ride beside us, his fowling-piece {{slung over his shoulder}} and his holster on his hip; a kind man and capable, and unlike Mr. Evans, my Uncle Grafton's overseer, was seldom known to use his firearms or the rawhide slung across his saddle. The negroes in their linsey-woolsey jackets and checked trousers would stand among the hills grinning at us children as we passed; and there was not one of them, nor of the white servants for that matter, that I could not <b>call</b> <b>by</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Right {{after breakfast}} {{we got up}} a rousing wood fire in the main hall (it is a cold morning) {{illuminated}} the place with a rich glow from all the globes of the newell chandelier, spread a bright rug before the fire, set a circling row of chairs (pink ones and dove-colored) {{and in the midst}} a low invalid-table covered with a fanciful cloth and laden with the presents--a pink azalia in lavish bloom from Rosa; a gold inscribed Russia-leather bible from Patrick and Mary; a gold ring (inscribed) from [...] "Maggy Cook;" [...] a silver thimble (inscribed with motto and initials) from Lizzie; a rattling mob of Sunday clad dolls from Livy and Annie, and a Noah's Ark from me, containing 200 wooden animals such as only a human being could create and only God <b>call</b> <b>by</b> <b>name</b> without referring to the passenger list. Then the family and the seven servants assembled there, and Susie and the [...] "Bay" [...] arrived in state from above, the Bay's head being fearfully and wonderfully decorated with a profusion of blazing red flowers and overflowing cataracts of lycopodium. Wee congratulatory notes accompanied the presents of the servants. I tell you it was a great occasion and a striking and cheery group, taking all the surroundings into account and the wintry aspect outside.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are more}} things {{in heaven and}} earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy," [...] and among these may be placed that marvel and mystery of the seas, the island of St. Brandan. Every school-boy can enumerate and <b>call</b> <b>by</b> <b>name</b> the Canaries, the Fortunate Islands of the ancients; which, {{according}} to some ingenious speculative minds, are mere wrecks and remnants of the vast island of Atalantis, mentioned by Plato, as having been {{swallowed up by the}} ocean. Whoever has read the history of those isles, will remember the wonders told of another island, still more beautiful, seen occasionally from their shores, stretching away in the clear bright west, with long shadowy promontories, and high, sun-gilt peaks. Numerous expeditions, both in ancient and modern days, have launched forth from the Canaries in quest of that island; but, on their approach, mountain and promontory have gradually faded away, until nothing has remained but the blue sky above, and the deep blue water below. Hence it was termed by the geographers of old, Aprositus, or the Inaccessible; while modern navigators have called its very existence in question, pronouncing it a mere optical illusion, like the Fata Morgana of the Straits of Messina; or classing it with those unsubstantial regions known to mariners as Cape Flyaway, and the Coast of Cloud Land.|$|E

50|$|Jensen's device {{exploits}} <b>call</b> <b>by</b> <b>name</b> and side-effects. <b>Call</b> <b>by</b> <b>name</b> is {{an argument}} passing convention that delays the evaluation of an argument until it is actually used in the procedure (a consequence of the copy rule for procedures). Algol introduced <b>call</b> <b>by</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Jensens device {{relies on}} <b>call</b> <b>by</b> <b>name,</b> but <b>call</b> <b>by</b> <b>name</b> is subtle and has some problems. Consequently, <b>call</b> <b>by</b> <b>name</b> is not {{available}} in most languages. Knuth comments that ALGOL 60 cannot express an [...] procedure that increases its argument by one; the call [...] does not do the expected action if [...] is a functional that changes with each access. Knuth says, [...] "The use of macro definition facilities to extend language, instead of relying solely on procedures for this purpose, results in a more satisfactory running program." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jensen's Device is a {{computer}} programming technique that exploits <b>call</b> <b>by</b> <b>name.</b> It was devised by Danish computer scientist JÃ¸rn Jensen, who worked with Peter Naur at Regnecentralen. They worked on the GIER Algol compiler, {{one of the earliest}} correct implementations of ALGOL 60. [...] ALGOL 60 used <b>call</b> <b>by</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E

50|$|Simula {{supports}} <b>call</b> <b>by</b> <b>name</b> so the Jensen's Device {{can easily}} be implemented.However, the default transmission mode for simple parameter is call by value, contrary to ALGOL which used call by name.The source code for the Jensen's Device must therefore specify <b>call</b> <b>by</b> <b>name</b> for the parameters when compiled by a Simula compiler.|$|E

50|$|In contrast, <b>call</b> <b>by</b> <b>name</b> {{does not}} {{evaluate}} {{inside the body}} of an unapplied function.|$|E
50|$|To {{implement}} the head reduction of a term u v {{which is an}} application, but {{which is not a}} redex, one must reduce the body u to exhibit an abstraction and therefore create a redex with v. When a redex appears, one reduces it. To reduce always the body of an application first is called <b>call</b> <b>by</b> <b>name.</b> The Krivine machine implements <b>call</b> <b>by</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E
50|$|Call-by-name {{evaluation}} is occasionally preferable to call-by-value evaluation. If a function's argument {{is not used}} in the function, <b>call</b> <b>by</b> <b>name</b> will save time by not evaluating the argument, whereas call by value will evaluate it regardless. If the argument is a non-terminating computation, the advantage is enormous. However, when the function argument is used, <b>call</b> <b>by</b> <b>name</b> is often slower, requiring a mechanism such as a thunk.|$|E
