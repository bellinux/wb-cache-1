500|$|Three {{investigators}} from the Department of Civil Aviation began {{work at the}} crash scene {{the day after the}} accident. They found the Amana had crashed in a heavily timbered area on the Inkpen family property Berry Brow, on the easterly track between Perth airport and Kalgoorlie, at a point where the elevation was about [...] above sea level. The aircraft struck the tops of tall gum trees while descending at an angle of about 15° below horizontal. Its speed at impact was estimated at [...] It crashed through large trees, breaking them off as if they were matchsticks, before impacting the ground violently and gouging a long, wide furrow. The left wing was torn away from the fuselage and then the aircraft broke up and burst into flames. Only the rear fuselage with the fin and rudder were not affected by fire. The wreckage trail was about [...] long and [...] wide. At the time of impact the Amana's left wing was lower than its right, suggesting it may have been turning left. It was heading north, not east towards Cunderdin. Investigators speculated that the crew may have been turning with the intention of returning to Perth airport; or they may have been preparing for a crash-landing in a large <b>clear</b> <b>area</b> {{to the north of the}} crash site.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{crashed in}} a <b>clear</b> <b>area</b> between huts at the South Guildford housing camp, a former Army camp where 70 huts {{were being used}} to house civilians. As {{a result of the}} aircraft diving vertically to the ground, the wreckage was mostly confined within an area that was no larger than [...] square. [...] The aircraft narrowly missed the surrounding huts with wreckage coming to within [...] of one hut, and within 5 paces of the front verandah of another. [...] One propeller was found about [...] from the wreckage.|$|E

[...] and [...] "To provide a <b>clear</b> <b>area</b> beyond the rumble strip for bicycle travel, highway maintenance agencies should periodically sweep shoulders along identified bicycle routes of high bicycle usage." ...|$|E

2500|$|It is now {{recommended}} practice for any new runway {{to have a}} <b>clear</b> <b>area</b> at least [...] long at each end, called a 'runway safety area', to allow additional space for an aircraft that overruns the runway to decelerate and stop in relative safety. [...] As Midway was constructed before these rules were put in place, {{it does not have}} this safety area. The accident renewed debates on the need for, and feasibility of, an engineered materials arrestor system, or EMAS, at Chicago Midway, given the lack of adequate overrun areas, and the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Additionally, actions taken by the city to acquire land for a buffer zone around the airport (in apparent recognition of the hazard) came to light after the crash. In 2007, installation began on modified, short-length arrestor beds. The first one was completed at the end of Runway 31C by summer 2007. EMAS beds have also been installed at the end of 04R, 13C and 22L.|$|E

60|$|In one of {{the most}} secluded {{portions}} of the valley, within a stone’s cast of Fayaway’s lake—for so I christened the scene of our island yachting—and hard by a growth of palms, which stood ranged in order along both banks of the stream, waving their green arms as if to do honour to its passage, was the mausoleum of a deceased warrior-chief. Like all the other edifices of any note, it was raised upon a small pi-pi of stones, which, being of unusual height, was a conspicuous object from a distance. A light thatching of bleached palmetto-leaves hung over it like a self-supported canopy; for it was not until you came very near that you saw it was supported by four slender columns of bamboo, rising at each corner to a little more than the height of a man. A <b>clear</b> <b>area</b> of a few yards surrounded the pi-pi, and was enclosed by four trunks of cocoa-nut trees, resting at the angles on massive blocks of stone. The place was sacred. The sign of the inscrutable Taboo was seen, {{in the shape of a}} mystic roll of white tappa, suspended by a twisted cord of the same material from the top of a slight pole planted within the enclosure.(3) The sanctity of the spot appeared never to have been violated. The stillness of the grave was there, and the calm solitude around was beautiful and touching. The soft shadows of those lofty palm trees—I can see them now—hanging over the little temple, as if to keep out the intrusive sun.|$|E

The extent and distribution of the <b>clear</b> <b>areas</b> shown by both single- and double-factor Clearflight Pieds are variable.

50|$|The Australian Pieds {{are very}} similar in {{appearance}} to the Clearflight Pieds, with a nape spot, clear areas on the wings and a <b>clear</b> <b>area</b> on the breast. They differ from the Clearflight Pied in the nape spot, which is not always present, and in their feet, which are usually pink. But the main point of difference is in the <b>clear</b> <b>area</b> of the body, which in the Australian Pied {{is located in the}} middle or lower breast, with the upper breast being always normally coloured, so that there is a clear division between the mask and the breast, just as in normal birds. In the Clearflight Pied the <b>clear</b> <b>area</b> on the breast, if present, is almost always adjacent to and running into the mask. Australian Pieds often have larger clear areas on the wings than Clearflight Pieds, with all primaries and many secondaries often clear, but this cannot be taken as a distinguishing feature as the pied areas are very variable in extent in both mutations. Australian Pieds have the usual white iris ring when adult, distinguishing them clearly from Recessive Pieds, which have no iris ring at any age.|$|E
