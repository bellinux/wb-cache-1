Access was at the ends via open lattice gates and the units were modified {{so that they could}} run off-peak as 3-car units. For the joint Hammersmith & City line service, the Met and the GWR purchased twenty 6-cars trains with Thomson-Houston equipment. In 1904, a further order was placed by the Met for 36 motor cars and 62 trailers with an option for another 20 motor cars and 40 trailers. Problems with the Westinghouse equipment led to Thomson-Houston equipment being specified when the option was taken up and more powerful motors being fitted. Before 1918, the motor cars with the more powerful engines were used on circle services with three trailers. The open lattice gates were seen as a problem when working above ground and all of the cars had been modified to replace the gates with vestibules by 1907. Having access only through the two end doors became a problem on busy circle services and centre sliding doors were fitted from 1911.From 1906, some of the Ashbury bogie stock was converted into multiple units by fitting <b>cabs,</b> control <b>equipment</b> and motors.

40|$|Overexposure to {{airborne}} respirable {{crystalline silica}} (or quartz) dust can cause debilitating or fatal respiratory disease. The workers most frequently overexposed to silica dust at surface mines are overburden drillers and operators of mobile excavating equipment, such as bulldozers, front-end loaders, and trucks. Enclosed cabs with heating, ventilation, {{and air conditioning}} (HVAC) systems are typically integrated into the drills and mobile equipment to protect the operator from the outside environment. Air filtration is often part of the HVAC system as an engineering control of airborne dusts. The basic HVAC system mainly recirculates cab interior air through the heat exchangers for effective heating and cooling of the cab, with some additional makeup air drawn by the recirculation fan(s) through an exterior inlet. Filtration is usually performed on the exterior intake air and sometimes on the interior recirculation air of the HVAC system. Cab air filtration performance depends on {{the efficiency of the}} air filters, airflow through the filters, dust loading on the filters, exterior air leakage around the intake filter, and wind penetration of outside air into the cab enclosure.

40|$|Many {{different}} types of surface mining <b>equipment</b> use enclosed <b>cabs</b> to protect <b>equipment</b> operators from health and safety hazards. The overburden removal and mining process can be extremely dusty and can cause excessive dust exposure. To study this issue, a cooperative research effort was established between the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, U. S. Silica Co., Clean Air Filter Co., and Red Dot Corp. {{in an effort to}} lower respirable dust levels in an enclosed cab on an older surface drill at a silica sand operation. Throughout this research effort, a number of modifications were incorporated into the drill's filtration and pressurization system, as well as in other areas, to improve its design and performance. An average cab efficiency of 93. 4 % was determined with gravimetric sampling instruments when comparing the outside with the inside cab dust levels on the final design. Although this study considered just one operation, the goal was to identify cost-effective improvements that could be implemented on all types of enclosed cabs to lower respirable dust concentrations. Two critical components for an effective enclosed cab system are having a properly designed, installed, and maintained filtration and pressurization system, along with a method for maintaining structural cab integrity, which allows the cab to be positively pressurized. Another important component is maintaining cab cleanliness.

40|$|The {{approximate}} vibrational and acoustical {{responses of}} structural-acoustic {{systems can be}} modeled based on vibrational energy concepts so that the general behavior and response level of the systems are easily identified in an average sense. Currently the main energy-based method is statistical energy analysis (SEA). An alternative approach, {{referred to as the}} energy finite element method (EFEM), has been proposed. One of the main objectives of this investigation is to find the essential relationship between the two methods and to develop a new approach for energy modeling of high frequency structural-acoustic systems. An EFEM 0 technique has been developed from the energy flow analysis (EFA) equations using a finite volume method (FVM). The formulation produces apparent “coupling factors” for both continuous and discontinuous systems. The resulting systems of equations have a simple band matrix form similar to that of SEA equations. The EFEM 0 can be applied to relatively heavily damped, strongly coupled systems where conventional SEA theory is not applicable. ^ The accuracy of the EFA and SEA methods has been analyzed in order to find the applicable thresholds of the two methods. The EFA and EFEM 0 have been extended to orthotropic plate systems. In the cases where the direct field is significant, a hybrid EFEM 0 technique is proposed to improve the predictions. The EFEM 0 and hybrid-EFEM 0 techniques have been verified numerically or experimentally for analytical systems and engineering problems. Finally, all these techniques are applied to a complex built-up system, a heavy <b>equipment</b> <b>cab.</b> The cab EFEM 0 -SEA model is experimentally validated in this study. ...|$|R

40|$|Miners at noncoal {{surface mining}} {{operations}} are often exposed {{to high levels}} of respirable dust. In an effort to lower the respirable dust exposure of these surface miners, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has been conducting research to address this problem in a practical and economically viable manner. One successful effort deals with lowering the dust exposure of equipment operators in enclosed cabs. Many types of surface mining <b>equipment</b> utilize enclosed <b>cabs</b> to protect <b>equipment</b> operators from dust exposure. Normally when the equipment is new, the cabs are fairly airtight. These tightly sealed cabs, combined with good filtration systems, generally provide the operator with good dust protection. However, most mining equipment is older, and as aging occurs, many components of the enclosure deteriorate. The structural integrity of the cab diminishes and the effectiveness of the air filtration system fails. NIOSH has been successfully researching costs-effective methods to improve both filtration effectiveness and cab integrity of these older cabs in order to provide a healthier work environment for equipment operators. Dust sampling records indicate that drill operators and helpers have the highest dust exposure of all workers at surface mining operations. Since much of the overburden contains a high percentage of silica, the health hazard associated with this dust can be even more serious. NIOSH research is addressing techniques to lower respirable dust levels at surface drilling operations.

Background Enclosed cabs are used on mobile equipment to protect operators from health and safety hazards. The primary health concern is overexposure to respirable dust. Examples of such equipment in mining include drills, dozers, haul trucks, and other equipment. When equipment is new, the operator 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s dust exposure is normally at acceptable levels. As the equipment ages and gaskets and seals deteriorate, the air quality inside an enclosed cab can {{reach a point where}} it is no longer at acceptable levels for the equipment operators. In an effort to improve the air quality in enclosed cabs of older mining equipment, NIOSH has been performing research to retrofit cabs with new filtration and pressurization systems. Over the past few years, this research has shown that retrofit systems can substantially improve the cab 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s air quality back to safe and acceptable levels. How-ever, this is only possible when a positive cab pressure is achieved and maintained. Thus, when a cab door or window is opened, the cab pressure drops to zero and the cab filtration and pressurization system is rendered ineffective. During a recent field study, the magnitude of this impact was noted when a drill operator repeatedly opened the cab door throughout the course of the drill cycle. Upon closer examination, it was determined that the cab door was being opened to manually guide the next drill steel into place each time an additional section of steel was needed to drill deeper holes...|$|R
