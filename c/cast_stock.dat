40|$|This is {{the final}} report of a one-year, Laboratory-Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Casting and {{solidification}} of molten metals and metal alloys is a critical step {{in the production of}} high-quality metal stock and in the fabrication of finished parts. Control of the casting process can be the determining factor in both the quality and cost of the final metal product. Major problems with the quality of <b>cast</b> <b>stock</b> or finished parts can arise because of the difficulty of preventing variations in the alloy content, the generation of porosity or poor surface finish, and the loss of microstructure controlled strength and toughness resulting from the poor understanding and design of the mold filling and solidification processes. In this project, we sought to develop a new set of applications focused on adding the ability to accurately model solidification and grain growth to casting simulations. We implemented these applications within the Los Alamos Materials Modeling Platform, LAMMP, a graphical-based materials, and materials modeling environment being created at the Computational Testbed for Industry...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. High-precision near-net shape {{parts with}} {{excellent}} surface qualities {{can be produced}} with the forging process {{with a minimum of}} finishing operations thanks to the good formability of aluminium alloys. There has been a rapid increase in the use of aluminium forgings predominantly in the automotive industry, where weight savings for reduced fuel consumption and exhaust emissions is mandated by legislation. Aluminium forgings provide, in addition to low weight, high strength, good corrosion resistance and a fibrous grain structure to improve fatigue resistance. Typical commercial forging stock is the round bars produced by the extrusion of cast billets. An alternative process route that has received increasing attention in recent years is the casting of forging stock by a horizontal direct chill casting technique to make smaller billets without the need for extrusion to reduce their diameter. The anisotropy imparted to the forging stock via extrusion, often regarded as useful for the forging, is certainly missing in the former. However, <b>cast</b> <b>stock</b> has been reported to be more resistant to the formation of coarse surface grains than the extruded counterpart. The present work was undertaken to compare the casting and extrusion routes for the manufacture of 6082 alloy forging stock...|$|E

40|$|The {{die casting}} {{process is a}} name given to metal casting {{processes}} that utilize metal molds or permanent dies. There are really several distinct processes included under the general name. The die casting process actually has three main sub-processes. These are: (1) permanent mold casting, also called gravity die casting, (2) low-pressure die casting, and (3) high-pressure die casting. The three processes differ mainly {{in the amount of}} pressure that is used to force the molten metal into the die. The advantages of such a process include high production rates, exceptional dimensional repeatability, low part costs, and less machining due to reduced <b>casting</b> finish <b>stock.</b> The great heat transfer rate obtained by means of metal molds can further refine and improve the final cast structure, and therefore the mechanical properties, of the castings. The disadvantages are design limitations due to metal dies, higher initial die cost, and longer lead time for die construction and for changes to the die caused by a casting design change...|$|R
40|$|Radiographic (RT) and {{ultrasonic}} (UT) methods {{usually are}} used for flaw detection in railway rolling <b>stock</b> <b>casting</b> components. At the same time both methods have some serious disadvantages. RT method is expensive, creates unhealthy radioactive emanation and is low productive for testing components with the different thickness due long time for RT apparatus retuning. UT method is not efficient for testing surfaces with different curvature, low sensitive to surface flaws and need very good surface for good acoustical contact with transducer [1, 2]. The goal {{of this paper is}} to show the eddy current (EC) method possibility to detect surface breaking flaws in casting components with rough surface. Long time EC method was supposed to be not applicable for such product inspection due high noise from the surface inhomogeneities. Another problem is low frequency signal trend during EC probe scanning due the magnetic property changes. To reduce the surface inhomogeneities influence multiplexed array EC probes are proposed [3]. But these probes are very difficult and can’t be used with conventional EC device.

40|$|Since {{the middle}} of the twentieth century, the women’s prison has held its place in one of the danker corners of the popular imagination. A {{perennial}} setting for B-movies and pulp fiction, the women’s prison of popular culture provides a backdrop for a <b>cast</b> of <b>stock</b> characters and recurring plot motifs: the ingénue first-timer, the sadistic guard and aggressive prison lesbian. Offering a cultural analysis of representations of sexuality in women’s prisons, Ann Ciasullo has described this as ‘an enduring cultural erotic fantasy: women imprisoned, trapped with one another in a criminal and sexual underworld’. It is also a fantasy with roots in early criminological theory, which connected criminality to sexual inversion. Ciasullo tracks this ‘women-in-prison narrative’ across genres, including in her analysis psychological and sociological studies of women’s imprisonment produced from the 1920 s onwards. Here we see the social worlds of women prisoners organised around dyadic sexual relationships and complex pseudo-familial structures. For Ciasullo, it is the figure of the ‘prison lesbian’ that most clearly unites these disparate genres of the women-in-prison narrative. Appearing with remarkable consistency, she represents a site at which anxieties about sexuality, criminality, race and class play out 3. Ciasullo’s inclusion of psychological and sociological research as examples of the women-in-prison narrative invites a critical re-examination of academic as well as literary representations of the women’s prison...|$|R

40|$|A {{review of}} {{published}} literature {{was made to}} establish the fundamental aspects of rolling and allow an experimental programme to be planned. Simulated hot rolling tests, using pure lead as a model material, were performed on a laboratory mill to obtain data on load and torque when rolling square section stock. Billet metallurgy and consolidation of representative defects was studied when modelling the rolling of continuously <b>cast</b> square <b>stock</b> {{with a view to}} determining optimal reduction schedules that would result in a product having properties to the high level found in fully wrought billets manufactured from large ingots. It is difficult to characterize sufficiently the complexity of the porous central region in a continuously cast billet for accurate modelling. However, holes drilled into a lead billet prior to rolling was found to be a good means of assessing central void consolidation in the laboratory. A rolling schedule of 30 % (1. 429 : 1) per pass to a total of 60 % (2. 5 : 1) will give a homogeneous, fully recrystallized product. To achieve central consolidation, a total reduction of approximately 70 % (3. 333 : 1) is necessary. At the reduction necessary to achieve consolidation, full recrystallization is assured. A theoretical analysis using a simplified variational principle with experimentally derived spread data has been developed for a homogeneous material. An upper bound analysis of a single, centrally situated void has been shown to give good predictions of void closure with reduction and the reduction required for void closure for initial void area fractions 0. 45 %. A limited number of tests in the works has indicated compliance with the results for void closure obtained in the laboratory...|$|R
