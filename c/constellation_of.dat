5|$|In 2010, Vesta reached {{opposition}} in the <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> Leo {{on the night of}} 17–18 February, at about magnitude 6.1, a brightness that makes it visible in binocular range but generally not for the naked eye. Under perfect dark sky conditions where all light pollution is absent it might be visible to an experienced observer without the use of a telescope or binoculars. Vesta came to opposition again on 5 August 2011, in the <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> Capricornus at about magnitude 5.6.|$|E

5|$|Beta Pictoris {{is a star}} in the {{southern}} <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> Pictor, the Easel, and is located {{to the west of the}} bright star Canopus. It traditionally marked the sounding line of the ship Argo Navis, before the constellation was split. The star has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.861, so is visible to the naked eye under good conditions, though light pollution may result in stars dimmer than magnitude 3 being too dim to see. It is the second brightest in its constellation, exceeded only by Alpha Pictoris, which has an apparent magnitude of 3.30.|$|E

5|$|Gliese 876 d is an {{exoplanet}} approximately 15 {{light-years away}} in the <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> Aquarius. The planet was the third planet discovered orbiting the red dwarf Gliese 876.

Due to this low mass, it can be categorized as a super-Earth.|$|E

HD 28185 b orbits its sun in a circular orbit that is at the inner edge of its star's habitable zone.|$|E
40|$|A {{systems study}} was {{conducted}} to determine the most mass-efficient method of achieving spacecraft disposal by atmospheric reentry. The focus of the study was on disposal <b>of</b> <b>constellations</b> <b>of</b> small microsatellites in low earth orbit. The impact <b>of</b> <b>constellations</b> <b>of</b> spacecraft on the orbital debris population will be substantial in the future. There is currently a trend in the space community toward <b>constellations</b> <b>of</b> satellites involving increasingly larger numbers of spacecraft. Advantages <b>of</b> distributed <b>constellations</b> <b>of</b> microsatellites over traditional single-satellite deployments include increased performance, redundancy, and the possibility of reduced overall cost. MEMS and the concept of the silicon satellite make the development of microsatellites feasible. Policy, tracking limitations, storage orbits, and natural orbit decay are important considerations with regards to spacecraft disposal. Various chemical and electrical propulsive technologies are compared against tethers and ballistic coefficient-altering techniques to determine the most mass-efficient method for disposal of spacecraft by atmospheric reentry within one year. It was determined that tethers and ballistic-coefficient altering methods are indeed the most efficient method of achievin...|$|R

5|$|In 1756, French {{astronomer}} Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille {{introduced the}} <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> Circinus with the French name le Compas, representing {{a pair of}} dividing compasses, on a chart of the southern sky. On that chart, Lacaille portrayed the constellations of Norma, Circinus, and Triangulum Australe, respectively, as a set square and ruler, a compass, and a surveyor's level {{in a set of}} draughtsman's instruments. Circinus was given its current name in 1763, when Lacaille published an updated sky map with Latin names for the constellations he introduced.|$|E
5|$|Later, the 17th-century German {{celestial}} cartographer Johann Bayer {{called the}} constellation Triplicitas and Orbis terrarum tripertitus, {{for the three}} regions Europe, Asia, and Africa. Triangulus Septentrionalis was a name used to distinguish it from Triangulum Australe, the Southern Triangle. Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius excised three faint stars—6, 10 and 12 Trianguli—to form the new <b>constellation</b> <b>of</b> Triangulum Minus in his 1690 Firmamentum Sobiescianum, renaming the original as Triangulum Majus. The smaller constellation was not recognised by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) when the constellations were established in the 1920s.|$|E
