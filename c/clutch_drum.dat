50|$|One THM350 {{weak point}} was {{excessive}} end-play between the pump and center support and resulting wobble {{of the direct}} <b>clutch</b> <b>drum</b> due to both the end play and use of a relatively narrow bushing in the drum. This weak point can be addressed by using an extra thrust washer between the planetary gear and direct clutch to remove the end play and using a wider aftermarket bushing in the direct <b>clutch</b> <b>drum.</b> Another weak point is the relatively thin center support and the lightweight matching splines in the case. This weakness can be addressed by using an inexpensive aftermarket case saver kit.|$|E

5000|$|Around 1979, the THM-200 {{received}} a lockup torque converter, and some internal components (primarily the low/reverse <b>clutch</b> <b>drum</b> and planetary gears) were later {{shared with the}} Turbo-Hydramatic 200-4R. The low/reverse sprag (roller clutch) assembly was also shared with the 1988-04 Chrysler Torqueflite 904 (also 30, 31, 32RH) and its derivatives e.g the A500 and 42RE.|$|E
50|$|The Fordomatic {{two-speed}} transmission {{was introduced}} in 1959. A simplified version of the Cruise-O-Matic, it combined a torque connector and a compound planetary gear set. A front unit (multiple-disc) clutch provided high gear, a front band on the <b>clutch</b> <b>drum</b> provided low gear, and a band on the rear unit internal gear drum provided reverse. This transmission was offered on Ford, Fairlane, Mercury, Edsel, Falcon, Comet and Meteor cars with differences in the torque converter, valve bodies and clutch plates to accommodate differing engine torques.|$|E
50|$|The A500, later renamed 40RH and 42RH (hydraulic {{controlled}} governor pressure) and 40RE, 42RE, 44RE (electronic controlled governor pressure, 1993-up), was an A904 derivative used in {{trucks and}} vans. Introduced in the 1989 model {{year on a}} limited basis, {{it was the first}} light-duty Chrysler four-speed automatic and was placed behind the 3.9 L and 5.2 L engines for light-duty purposes. Forward direct <b>clutch</b> <b>drum</b> (same as the A998) usually has a 4 friction disc pack - an A999 forward direct <b>clutch</b> <b>drum</b> with the 5 friction disc pack does interchange. Much like the later production A904 with a wide ratio gear a double wrap low-reverse band is used. An extension housing mounted (New Process built) overdrive unit was bolted {{to the rear of the}} case to provide a total of four forward speeds; the extension housing and its internals interchange with the 46-48RH/RE (A518/618) - when overhauling the overdrive unit transmission rebuilders usually would use replacement parts from the A518/618 overdrive section since the A500 internals are light duty e.g. number of friction discs and thick pressure plates. The overdrive housing (RWD/2WD) uses an output shaft yoke commonly shared with the A727 and its later derivatives except the A618/48RE. Electronic governor pressure was phased in during the middle of the 1993 model year where it was renamed as the A500SE - Jeep Grand Cherokees equipped with the 4.0L used the A500SE/42RE since the middle of the 1993 model year replacing the AW4. This transmission was replaced by the 42RLE in 2004.|$|E

50|$|The Corvair Powerglide {{provided}} one reduction {{range and}} reverse, {{in addition to}} direct drive and neutral. Low and Reverse ranges were a 1.82 ratio reduction, using a single planetary gearset. Locking the planetary geartrain provided a 1:1 direct drive. The differential driven rear pump permitted push-starting the Powerglide-equipped Corvair (the last American automatic to do so), at speeds over 18 mph by creating adequate pressure to engage low band and turn over the engine via the torque converter. A multiple plate clutch engaged reverse range, low was braked using a band on the forward <b>clutch</b> <b>drum,</b> and direct provided via clutches. The torque converter of the Corvair offered 2.6:1 reduction at stall, and improved car performance when engine speeds were below ~2000 rpm.|$|E
50|$|Chain brakes prevent {{movement}} of the saw's cutting chain by applying a steel brake band around the driven <b>clutch</b> <b>drum.</b> Clamping force for the brake band is provided by a powerful spring. The chain brake has two purposes. First, {{it can be used}} to secure the chain when changing position, moving between cuts or starting a cold saw, which requires a partly open throttle. This would otherwise lead to uncontrolled chain movement, a major hazard in older saws. Secondly, the chainbrake can activate under kickback conditions to prevent the operator from being struck by a running chain. Being struck by even a static chain may cause serious injury, but anything that can be done to mitigate the usually dreadful injuries caused by contact with a moving chain is of considerable benefit to operators. Kickback injuries usually occur to the head, face, neck and shoulders; when a running chain is involved, such injuries are usually very serious, often disfiguring and sometimes fatal.|$|E

Fiat was contracted {{to take part in}} the creation of the massive VAZ plant in the newly created town of Togliatti, named after the Italian communist leader of the same name. The factory produced an adapted version 124R of the 124, known as the VAZ-2101 [...] "Zhiguli" [...] (sold as the Lada 1200/1300 in export markets), until 1982, and 1200s until 1987. Based on the 124, they were modified at more than 800 points, the major modifications having an entirely different Fiat OHC engine, hydraulic <b>clutch,</b> <b>drum</b> brakes at the rear, modified suspensions, etc. Early modifications include the VAZ-2102 (station wagon), 2103 (Lada 1500), 2106 (Lada 1600) and 21011 (Lada 1300). The updated and restyled versions of the 124-based design were produced until September 2012, as the VAZ-2104, 2105 and 2107 - marketed as the Lada Riva (or Lada Classic) in most Western European markets.

5000|$|Right {{after the}} 1973 OPEC oil embargo, GM {{developed}} a lighter-duty {{version of the}} THM350 with lightened materials — primarily alloys in place of ferrous materials (e.g. <b>clutch</b> <b>drums</b> and oil pump), the Turbo-Hydramatic 200. The THM-200 was first used in 1976 models including GM's T-cars (which includes the rebadged Isuzu Gemini sold through Buick dealers as the Buick/Opel by Isuzu), X-cars, and some Isuzu automobiles (Chevrolet LUV and Isuzu P'up). However, this transmission was notorious for its failure rate when used behind too large an engine - the largest displacement being the Oldsmobile 5.7L Diesel. No multicase bellhousings were used - bellhousing patterns included Chevrolet V8, Buick-Oldsmobile-Pontiac, Vega 4, GM 60 degree pattern (includes the Tech IV), and Isuzu G engine.|$|R
40|$|Great Lakes bulk {{carriers}} of recent construction are propelled by geared diesel machinery. Although this machinery {{is similar to}} propulsion sets {{that have been used}} successfully in numerous other vessel types, it has experienced failures in sufficient number to suggest that the Lakes ships present unique service features.

The earlier report presents the results of finite element analysis of hull deflections of two typical ships. &&This report extends the earlier analysis to deflections of individual components, with deflections either imposed by the hull deflections, or by loads that may not have been analyzed adequately in traditional design processes.

40|$|Abstract. Using the Taguchi method, a 5 -factorial, 3 -level {{orthogonal}} array (L’ 18 (35)) {{was used}} as the experimental layout for 18 kinds of frictional lining specimen. These specimens were prepared in order to investigate their performance in establish a relationship between Ts/Td (Ts: static torque; Td: dynamic torque) and dµ/dνx (µ: friction coefficient; νx: relative velocity of frictional lining and <b>clutch</b> <b>drum)</b> parameters. The frictional torque and the rotational speeds of the driveline, clutch, and <b>clutch</b> <b>drum</b> as functions of contact time for 100 clutch cycles are experimentally obtained dµ/dνx and Ts/Td. In the study, a sharp rise in maximum contact pressure ratio occurred when the relative sliding velocity reached the critical velocity, Vc. This increase in maximum contact pressure ratio generally led to an increase of the (initially negative) dµ/dνx value. The mean values of dµ/dνx and Ts/Td for the clutching tests with 100 cycles can be roughly divided into three groups dependent on the fluctuation intensities of these two parameters, for each of which there is a linear relationship. The maximum contact pressure ratio significantly increases even increasing the mean value of dµ/dνx...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the Master Thesis done by two {{students at the}} Mechanical Engineering program, Design Engineering at Luleå University of Technology. The thesis was performed at Luleå University of Technology in collaboration with BorgWarner PDS located in Landskrona. The objective for the thesis was to study the potential for predicting and optimizing drag losses and oil flow characteristics in a wet clutch system using numerical simulations in LS-DYNA. BorgWarner PDS manufactures and distributes the Haldex coupling, which is an electro-hydraulic coupling used in an active four-wheel drive system. BorgWarner PDS strives to make the Haldex coupling more efficient by minimizing energy losses in order to lower fuel consumption for the vehicle and a smaller impact on the environment. As testing on prototypes are costly and time consuming it is therefore desirable to use numerical simulations instead. To determine the potential for numerical simulations to predict and optimize both drag losses and oil flow characteristics a numerical model was set up using LS-DYNA. A test rig was designed {{in order to achieve}} a controlled testing environment in order to validate the numerical models, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The numerical model uses the built in Fluid Structure Interaction method in LS-DYNA, which is a combination of a structural model and an incompressible fluid model. The test rig measures torque on the clutch housing induced by the dragging of oil as the <b>clutch</b> <b>drum</b> rotates. The tests were performed using different rotational speeds, varying from 250 - 1500 rpm, and different clutch housing geometries. The results were gathered from an average of ten measurements of the drag torque. A high- speed camera was also used to capture the oil flow characteristics. The numerical simulations were done using the same parameters used for the tests i. e. different rotational speeds and clutch housing geometries. In addition, each simulation was performed using different mesh sizes; 0. 5 mm, 1 mm and 2 mm in order to analyze mesh dependence. The numerical model was set to measure the drag torque on the <b>clutch</b> <b>drum</b> and was then compared to the experimental results in order to validate the numerical model quantitatively. The oil flow characteristics from the numerical simulation were compared to the high-speed movies to validate the numerical model qualitatively. The numerical model shows promising results when it comes to predicting drag torque and oil flow characteristics. The results also show that using a numerical model for optimization purposes are possible as the experimentally measured drag torque at different clutch house geometries corresponds to the numerically simulated drag torque. The conclusions from this Master Thesis is that numerical simulations do have a potential for predicting drag losses and oil flow characteristics in a wet clutch system. The numerical model created in this project {{can also be used to}} obtain valuable information about geometry changes when it comes to optimizing the wet clutch system. However, the numerical model is still at an early stage and can be seen as a second generation model where further work needs to be done in order to include more of the complex geometries of a wet clutch system have. Although LS-DYNA is state-of-the-art when it comes to these kinds of complex simulations it still needs to be developed further to handle such complex simulations. ...|$|E

50|$|To {{demolish}} {{roofs and}} other horizontal spans, {{the ball is}} typically suspended by a length of steel chain attached to the lifting hook of a crane boom above the structure, the rope <b>drum</b> <b>clutch</b> is released and the ball is allowed to free-fall onto the structure. To demolish walls the ball is suspended at the desired height from a crane boom and a secondary steel rope pulls the ball toward the crane cab. The lateral rope <b>drum</b> <b>clutch</b> is then released and the ball swings as a pendulum to strike the structure. Another method for lateral demolition is to pivot the crane boom to accelerate the ball toward the target. This is repeated as needed until the structure is broken down into debris that can easily be loaded and hauled away. The demolition action is carried out entirely through the kinetic energy of the ball.|$|R

50|$|Honda {{released}} automated electric shift ATVs {{starting in}} model year 1998 with the TRX450FE aka Foreman 450ES ESP (Electric Shift Program). Shifting {{is accomplished by}} pressing either one of the gear selector arrows on the left handlebar control. The current selected gear is indicated by a digital display. The primary components of the shifting mechanisms were the same on both the manual and electric shift models, but the major difference was the deletion of the shift pedal {{and the addition of}} an internal electric shift servo which actuated the components (<b>clutch</b> assy, shift <b>drum,</b> etc.)in one motion instead of the traditional foot lever.

40|$|An {{attractive}} {{but little}} explored {{field of application}} of the shape-memory technology is the area of rotary actuators, in particular for generating endless motion. This paper presents a miniature rotary motor based on shape-memory alloy (SMA) wires and overrunning clutches, which produces high output torque and unlimited rotation. The concept features an SMA wire tightly wound around a low-friction cylindrical drum to convert wire strains into large rotations within a compact package. The seesaw motion of the drum ensuing from repeated contraction-elongation cycles of the wire is converted into unidirectional motion of the output shaft by an overrunning <b>clutch</b> fitted between <b>drum</b> and shaft. Following a design process developed in a former paper, a six-stage prototype with size envelope of 48 × 22 × 30 mm is built and tested. Diverse supply strategies are implemented to optimize either the output torque or the speed regularity of the motor with the following results: maximum torque = 20 Nmm; specific torque = 6. 31 × 10 - 4 Nmm/mm 3; rotation per module = 15 deg/cycle; and free continuous speed = 4. 4 rpm...|$|R
5000|$|Commercial Motor {{carried a}} review of the Graiseley PCV in 1940, which stated that this model had been in service with {{commercial}} operators, including bakeries and dairies, for two years. It came with a [...] motor, and was designed to travel at 3 mph, with a range of 8 to 10 mi on normal door-to-door delivery work. It could be supplied as a flat platform truck, with an open body suitable for milk delivery, or as a closed van, suitable for delivering bread. The motor, gearbox and an automatic clutch were mounted on the single front wheel forks. A chain formed part of the final drive. The control system included a contactor manufactured by British Thompson-Houston, and the centrifugal <b>drum</b> <b>clutch</b> was designed to engage when the motor reached 250 revs per minute, providing a smooth start without the need for starting resistors. The three-wheeled PCV was produced in three sizes, the Model 60, with a payload of 8-10 cwt, the Model 75, with a 12-15 cwt payload, and the Model 90, which could carry 22 cwt. Because the primary focus was on the dairy industry, the model numbers represented the number of imperial gallons of milk that could be carried.|$|R

In this thesis, there will be information about the problem with landmines today and how a landmine work, along with the development process for the product, including concept evaluation, calculations and simulations. The basic idea of the concept is that a load is to be dropped at the landmines location. The load will create a ground pressure that will trigger any pressure sensitive landmines. The load is a 25 kg heavy bag of sand and it will be dropped from a height of 1 meter. A winch lifts the load up and keeps it in the air. A <b>clutch</b> disconnects the <b>drum</b> {{from the rest of the}} winch system and the load drops to the ground. A scaffold is placed on the robot, with a pulley wheel at the top. The scaffold and the pulley wheel are designed and placed so that the pulley wheel is directly above the landmines, which are located in the middle and at the rear of the robot. A steel wire connects the load and the winch via the pulley wheel. The clutch is custom designed from scratch to fit the winch system. A linear actuator connects and disconnects the clutch. The winch is driven by a brushless direct current motor, along with a gearbox. Simulations done by FFI gives reason for optimism for the continuation of the project.
