40|$|Direct {{long fibre}} {{thermoplastics}} (D-LFT) composites based on polypropylene and glass fibre (PP/GF) {{are widely used}} for the manufacturing of semi-structural and structural automotive applications that include front-end carriers, running boards and door carriers, among other parts. The D-LFT process {{has a number of}} advantages when compared to the two step pre-compounded LFT pellet process, of which the most relevant are the cost reduction associated to the elimination of an intermediate step of producing pellets, the flexibility of modifying material formulations in-house at convenience and the reduction of heat and shear history of the material. Among the various configurations commercially available for D-LFT systems, two processes were considered for the present project. In the first process reinforcing fibres are fed and mixed with a molten polymer in a twin screw compounder and then extruded into a rectangular cross-section profile. This extrudate (sometimes referred to as a "log") is automatically cut to a specific length and transferred by a robot arm to a vertical <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>press</b> where the polymer/fibre compound is moulded to the desired shape. The moulding can be done by means of direct compression of the log or by its placement into a mould shot-pot device that actuates after the mould is completely closed. A second approach involves the use of an injection moulding compounding unit, comprised of a twin screw compounder and a shot-pot (incorporated this time into the compounding-injection unit) that discharges material through a long nozzle into the sprue of the mould in similar fashion as the conventional injection moulding process. This paper deals with the hypothesis that the differences in the geometry of the flow channels for these two approaches affect the length, dispersion and distribution of fibres in the polymer matrix. It has been well documented in literature that fibre length affects the mechanical properties of the composite material while dispersion and distribution affect the uniformity of these properties ['"]. A systematic analysis of composite material produced with the two processing methods described above was carried out. A Coperion-Dieffenbacher D-LFT system, using a shot-pot mould, and a Coperion-Husky, using the compounding-injection moulding process, were employed to mould identical parts under similar compounding conditions. Samples were taken from the parts for a comparison of the respective fibre lengths and distribution patterns of the two moulding technologies using the micro computed tomography (CT) scanning technique. A characterization of fibre length distribution was performed on the samples using image analysis software after pyrolysis. Resulting mechanical properties were compared to provide a comprehensive picture of the two processing technologies. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Compression {{moulding}} is {{the ideal}} candidate for large series production of thermoplastic composite parts. Improvements in this production technique will make it more appealing for those markets that are reluctant to use composites because of their development costs. Unlike other composites processing systems, the <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>press</b> is capable of producing fibre-reinforced plastic parts in significant volumes, with the accuracy, repeatability and speed to which, for example, the automotive industry has been accustomed in the stamping of metal parts. This thesis aims at {{a better understanding of}} the behaviour of the rubber mould during compression moulding of thermoplastics and consequently at the reduction of the development costs and improving the design of the rubber mould. The classical problems that need to be addressed when designing a rubber mould are the correct dimensions to accommodate the laminate and the positions of the details. The standard process, though, does not take into account the temperature changes in the mould during production and in particular the effect of the coefficient of thermal expansion of the rubber. In this thesis, an envisioned method to reduce this problem is to add a certain amount of aramide in the rubber mould, in order to restrict the expansion due to increased temperature. The second issue that has to be considered is the friction between the melted thermoplastic and the rubber mould. The use of lubricant is extremely effective, but can be used only in a prototyping phase, as the lubricant affects the mechanical properties of the thermoplastic composite. Proper modelling of the rubber forming process, considering the correct rubber parameters, allows identification of the problems that might occur during manufacturing. The way to eliminate those problems numerically, though, is computationally challenging as well as uncertain and time consuming. With those results in mind, an improved method was developed which substitutes the flexible rubber mould with a collection of rubber particles. The collection of rubber particles acts in a way similar to that of a fluid and has the advantage of filling the mould completely so that there is always contact between the rigid and the flexible mould. The new method allows the manufacturing of a wider range of products and allows the reduction of development costs related to the definition of the proper rubber mould shape. To be able to describe the collection of rubber particles as a homogeneus material, a series of tests has been designed for the determination of some of their physical parameters. The obtained material has a very variable stiffness, from a very low modulus when the particles are not compressed, to two orders of magnitude higher values when compaction is almost complete. Bulk and shear modulus are related to the Poissonâ€™s ratio that does not vary much during the entire process, having a value always slightly below 0. 5. This value is consistent with the fluid-like behavior in the beginning of the process and with the, almost incompressible, solid rubber block at the end of the process. Finally, the parameters found have been used to model the compression moulding process with a collection of rubber particles. Modeling is not strictly necessary because most of the existing problems in the conventional production method have been eliminated. However it might become useful when the limitations of the new production technique will be explored and in particular for those geometries that are not possible with the conventional method.

40|$|Abstract. Mould {{cleaning}} {{process is}} the process of removal build-up deposited or residue material on the mould surface after repeated cycles of production. The currently used mould cleaning process is sand blasting (abrasive process) and dry rubber mould cleaning compounds (depends on the skill of the operators during rubber compounding). Latex laminated compounds will be beneficial as a new substitute for mould cleaning because of its excellent strength properties and the lamination process to increase its thickness. The main focus of this research is to investigate the effect of lamination process on tensile properties and mould cleaning efficiency of laminated Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR) latex composites. Laminated NBR latex films with cleaning agent and waste latex compound was prepared by arranging half-cured latex sheets with various thicknesses of outer layer (NBR latex films with cleaning agent) and core layer (waste NBR latex film). The core and outer layers are prepared through casting method with different thickness. The laminated films were subjected to <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> using hot <b>press</b> at 120 oC.

The polymer {{composites}} {{consist of}} phenolic resin, natural graphite, carbon fiber and copper powder, are fabricated by hot <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> or <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> followed by post-curing. The density, electrical conductivity and flexural strength of composites are analyzed {{to determine the}} influences of post-curing temperature and preparing method on the physical, electrical and mechanical properties of composites.

40|$|A {{new process}} of {{combining}} gas injection with <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> {{was developed and}} studied in this research work. The process is called Gas Assisted <b>Compression</b> <b>Moulding</b> (or GasComp). The principle {{is based on the}} injection of nitrogen gas during a conventional <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> cycle. The flow of the material due to the compressive force of the press is assisted by the injection of gas into the centre of the molten material. The gas assists in the flow by coring out the material, reducing the weight by up to 45 percent and increasing the dimensional stability of the component. Novel glass matt thermoplastic mould tools were designed and developed {{during the course of the}} research program for use with the process. These designs were of a flash <b>compression</b> <b>mould</b> tool design with a horizontal clamping face, rather than the conventional positive plug <b>compression</b> <b>mould</b> tool with a vertical shear edge. This created a fixed volume mould tool, which when used in conjunction with a short shot of material, would allow the gas to flow the material to fill the remaining volume. Several materials were investigated for their suitability with the process. Their characterisation showed that they contained different glass fibre contents and architectures. A material with a short, dispersed glass fibre content of 11 percent proved to consistently contain a significant gas cavity. The glass architecture proved to be the most significant contributing factor in the creation of a successful gas cavity. The most significant processing parameter in the creation of a large volume cavity proved to be the gas injection delay time. The gas pressure and gas ramp time affected the cavity shape, length and extent of gas fingering. The shrinkage was reduced in the presence of a gas cavity, along with the visible reduction of sink marks. The presence of other moulding features, such as hesitation marks, gas packing and the change in fibre orientation were also discussed...|$|R
