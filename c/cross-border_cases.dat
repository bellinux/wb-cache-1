It then examines other alternatives for facilitating judicial recognition and enforcement of judgments between the courts in Hong Kong and mainland China that focus specifically on cross-border insolvency judgments (including court orders) that concern both Hong Kong and mainland China, such as signing a new arrangement, a special treaty, or a Memorandum of Understanding. It seeks to highlight the deficiencies of the Arrangement as well as discuss the options to remedy those deficiencies. The situation for Hong Kong-China <b>cross-border</b> insolvency <b>cases</b> is opaque due to the lack of local cross-border insolvency legislation in Hong Kong. In China, there is only one article (article 5) of the 2006 Enterprise Bankruptcy Law that concerns cross-border insolvency, but that article is inapplicable to Hong Kong-China <b>cross-border</b> insolvency <b>cases.</b> That article is inapplicable because it applies only to <b>cross-border</b> insolvency <b>cases</b> involving a foreign state. Since Hong Kong is not a foreign state, it is precluded from the article’s application. Also, Hong Kong and China have not adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency. Although internationally accepted soft law standards such as the Model Law can provide institutional guidance to cross-border insolvency matters, it is compatible with Hong Kong-China <b>cross-border</b> insolvency <b>cases</b> only when a third jurisdiction is involved. The lack of a formal judicial recognition mechanism for Hong Kong-China cross-border insolvency judgments creates problems such as legal uncertainty and forum shopping.

In fact, the latter has to measure up to the standards set by the former, like any domestic field of law should. Accordingly, respect for family and private life, as internationally guaranteed, shows that a self-contained regime merely defined by reference to the classic definitional categories and techniques of national law is less and less suitable to deal with <b>cross-border</b> <b>cases.</b> In essence this paper, while considering <b>cross-border</b> <b>cases</b> and international practice, argues that fundamental rights prescribe an inherent and positive obligation of result to recognize and enforce a family relationship lawfully created abroad. This approach entails, firstly, a derogation from the proceedings for recognition and enforcement {{set forth in the}} national system of PIL, and, secondly, a positive obligation to be fulfilled by public authorities. In this human-rightsbased perspective, PIL requirements must then be re-shaped, where possible by means of interpretation, to safeguard the fundamental rights of the individuals concerned...|$|E

However, the Act is not a comprehensive international insolvency statute.

40|$|This article {{contends that}} notions of «peace» and «justice» in {{cross-border}} water management vary in different world regions. Moreover, it argues that «peace» and «justice» {{can be explained}} by analyzing the interaction between «regional» interpretations and implementation of water security norms and local cross-border power structures. «Regional water security» is defined as the normative commitment to provide necessary water resources to communities within world regions. «Power,» which is defined traditionally as «the ability of actors to obtain their objectives despite opposition» is viewed as a function of political entrepreneurialism and opportunity structures. This article derives from a review of the pertinent literatures on «water security» and «water justice,» the two elements of «water peace» as well as scholarship on cross-border water management in different world regions. It discusses water governance within the framework of cross-border politics and comparative regional integration. It also includes analysis of the policy documents and websites of seventeen regional organizations as well as interviews with key actors and local experts on water management in specific <b>cross-border</b> <b>case</b> studies. The article is divided into five sections. Following this introduction, part two examines «water security» and «water justice» in international affairs.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{harmonised}} {{private international law}} instruments {{appear to be the}} foundation of the whole EU civil justice framework, which primarily aims to provide effective remedies for litigants in <b>cross-border</b> <b>cases.</b> Given the level of diversity across the EU, a major feature of the EU legal landscape is the triangular relationship between the allocation of jurisdiction and identification of applicable law, on the one hand, and the available remedy, on the other hand. It appears that, {{when it comes to the}} administration of justice in a cross-border context within the EU, this triangular relationship encompasses the ability of the Member States’ courts to deal with cross-border disputes which may be important for the forum selection process. An EU model of administration of justice, which allows litigants to choose where to litigate, may result in some jurisdictions being promoted as dominant. This can only happen, of course, because the EU has already created free movement of judgments in large areas of commercial and family law. Once a judgment has been secured in any one EU Member State it should be enforceable in all others with little or no hindrance. However, litigants may have to consider where a judgment is to be actually enforced given that the rules on actual enforcement are not harmonised in the EU (this may be particularly significant in relation to family law disputes). The dominant jurisdictions could be attracting more <b>cross-border</b> <b>cases,</b> and thus some jurisdictions may become a venue of choice for the high value cross-border disputes. It is important to assess, on the basis of relevant empirical data, how the current EU Civil Justice framework is shaping the litigants’ strategies and whether the objectives of the EU PIL legislative instruments are effectively pursued in a cross-border context.
