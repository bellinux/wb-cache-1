40|$|Abstract. This paper defines two {{concepts}} of rigidity for tensegrity frameworks (frameworks with <b>cables,</b> <b>bars,</b> and struts) : prestress stability and second-order rigidity. We demonstrate {{a hierarchy of}} rigidity [...] first-order rigidity implies prestress stability implies second-order rigidity implies rigiditymfor any framework. Examples show {{that none of these}} implications are reversible, even for bar frameworks. Other examples illustrate how these results can be used to create rigid tensegrity frameworks. This paper also develops a duality for second-order rigidity, leading to a test which combines information on the self stresses and the first-order flexes of a framework to detect second-order rigidity. Using this test, the following conjecture of Roth is proven: a plane tensegrity framework, in which the vertices and bars form a strictly convex polygon with additional cables across the interior, is rigid if and only if it is first-order rigid.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} testing and the numerical simulation of the impulsive dynamics of a tensegrity lattice. The analyzed system is a column made of ten regular tensegrity prisms, each composed of two solid triangular plates (bases), three cross bars, and three cross <b>cables.</b> <b>Bars</b> and bases are additively manufactured in a titanium alloy, through electron-beam melting, while cross cables are made of Spectra fibers and {{are added to the}} titanium structure afterward 3 D-printing process. The experimental response of the examined tensegrity column under impact loading is studied by recording the waves traveling through the system by means of a Digital Image Correlation algorithm, which measures the axial displacements of the bases of each unit. We compare the experimental results with those obtained from numerical simulations performed by adopting two different nonlinear elastic models: one accounting for the presence of bending-stiff connections between the 3 D-printed elements, and for the resulting mixed bending-stretching regime; the other one being a tensegrity model which describes a purely stretching response of the column. Such a comparison shows that the presence of bending-stiff connections may weaken the nonlinearity of the wave dynamics that is typical of tensegrity lattices with frictionless nodal connections. We also observe that a marked nonlinear behavior occurs in the case of pure-tensegrity response (no bending deformation) under small prestress...|$|R

The graph of the framework, in which edges are labeled as <b>bars,</b> <b>cables,</b> and struts, is called a tensegrity graph.

A related problem is how to find a rigid labeling of a graph using no bars. Our main result is an efficient combinatorial algorithm for finding a rigid cable–strut labeling of a given graph in the case when d= 2. The algorithm is based on a new inductive construction of redundant graphs, i. e.  graphs which have a realization as a bar framework in which each bar can be deleted without increasing the degree of freedom. The labeling is constructed recursively by using labeled versions of some well-known operations on bar frameworks...|$|R
