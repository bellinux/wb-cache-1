5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Holman Hardt {{is actually the}} one controlling the weather. All of the bizarre weather was the side-effect of his long-silent love for Sheila. He felt guilty that his weather-related problem caused Mootz to crash his <b>car,</b> <b>so</b> he would cause it to rain for Mootz. Once he realized Mootz had been drunk {{the night of the}} accident, however, he stopped. Unfortunately, Mulder begins to unintentionally attract Sheila, resulting in a massive thunderstorm that materializes due to the meteorologist's emotions. At the town's high school reunion, however, Hardt admits his love for Sheila, who accepts him. The storm stops, and Hardt and Sheila live happily ever after.|$|E
5|$|Upon his retirement, Butler {{bought a}} home in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, where {{he lived with his}} wife. In June 1940, he checked himself into the {{hospital}} after becoming sick a few weeks earlier. His doctor described his illness as an incurable condition of the upper gastro-intestinal tract that was probably cancer. His family remained by his side, even bringing his new <b>car</b> <b>so</b> he could see it from the window. He {{never had a chance to}} drive it. On June 21, 1940, Smedley Butler died in the Naval Hospital in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Homer test {{drives a}} new {{electric}} <b>car</b> <b>so</b> {{that he can}} get a free gift. After destroying the car, the family returns to the dealer to receive the gift, which Homer forgets to open until he is in bed with Marge. His gift turns out to be free tickets to a preview screening of the new Mel Gibson film, a remake of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. The audience members are given comment cards to fill. The filmmakers can change the film based on the audiences' reactions. The film is enjoyed by everyone but Homer. During the screening, Gibson, having come to the test screening unannounced, is assured by the producers that the film is wonderful. While reading the comment cards after the movie, Gibson is certain that everyone loves him too much to tell him how to improve the film. When he reads Homer's comments, he thinks that Homer was the only person brave enough to tell him the truth.|$|E

5|$|Varlyn Stroud is a convict. His {{original}} biography gives {{insight into}} his criminal past and names Stroud's sister Clara {{as his first}} murder. When Clara was nine years old, Stroud deliberately upset a Ferris wheel <b>car</b> <b>so</b> Clara fell to her death. Stroud's second murder was his grandfather three years later, which he covered as a hunting accident. Having possibly committed over a dozen contract-killings, Stroud was never convicted of murder, yet still {{spent most of his}} life in prison on a variety of charges. Stroud's story arc in the series begins in season 2 when he hears Brother Justin's radio sermon. Made Brother Justin's apostle in a subliminal message, Stroud escapes prison to find and bring Henry Scudder to Brother Justin. Stroud first tracks Scudder's old life and later follows the route of the carnival. With Ben's unintentional aid, Stroud finally finds the man he is looking for. After delivering Scudder to Brother Justin, Stroud becomes his security manager, which significantly hinders the carnival's aim to kill Brother Justin.|$|E
25|$|Although no tramway {{abandonment}} {{had taken}} place since 1932, some 30 trams were considered as surplus to requirements in November, but the only price offered was £13 per <b>car,</b> <b>so</b> they were dismantled by the Department, the bodies and scrap metal being sold separately.|$|E
25|$|The Pulitzer Prize-winning {{automotive}} journalist Dan Neil {{has suggested}} that, {{with the introduction}} of the Countryman, Mini had pushed the marque beyond relevance by making a <b>car</b> <b>so</b> long, wide and tall it forsook the inner logic of the brand: excellent handling in a tiny size.|$|E
5000|$|However, sales {{declined}} further {{after the}} post-war motorcycling boom {{owing to the}} availability of cheaper motor <b>cars,</b> <b>so</b> not many [...] "Series D" [...] models were made.|$|R

25|$|Coach Class: Coach Class is the {{standard}} class of service on all Amtrak trains except the Acela Express. Seats in coach recline and feature a fold-down tray table, foot rest, individual reading light, and power outlet. Coach cars on long-distance trains are configured with fewer seats per <b>car</b> <b>so</b> that passengers have additional legroom and seats are equipped with leg rests.|$|E
25|$|The braking system, {{adapted from}} the DS, employs disc brakes at all four corners (the DS has drums at the rear), with the front brakes being inboard, and cooled via large ducts on the front {{underside}} of the car. The hydraulic braking pressure front to rear balance is self-adjusting according to the weight {{in the rear of}} the <b>car,</b> <b>so</b> on hard braking the entire car lowers evenly.|$|E
25|$|Imagine {{for example}} using a {{stopwatch}} to mark-off tiny increments {{of time as}} a car travels down a highway.

25|$|As the prototypes took shape, the {{exterior}} lines resembled {{more of a}} Ferrari or Porsche than a typical GM car, but the tight budget was taking its toll on the design, particularly on Aldikacti's dream of a high performance, aluminum-block V6; the cost of developing a new engine {{would be more than}} the production of the whole car itself. Instead, Aldikacti was forced to settle for the already manufactured four-cylinder engine GM produced for the Pontiac, the “Iron Duke,” nicknamed for its heavy iron block. This engine was too blocky to fit into the tiny <b>car</b> <b>so</b> it was equipped with a smaller oil pan, causing the engine to always run a quart low.|$|E
25|$|On February 27, 1992, Stella Liebeck, a 79-year-old {{woman from}} Albuquerque, New Mexico, ordered a 49-cent {{cup of coffee}} from the drive-through window of a local McDonald's {{restaurant}} located at 5001 Gibson Boulevard Southeast. Liebeck was in the passenger's seat of a 1989 Ford Probe which did not have cup holders. Her grandson parked the <b>car</b> <b>so</b> that Liebeck could add cream and sugar to her coffee. Liebeck placed the coffee cup between her knees and pulled {{the far side of}} the lid toward her to remove it. In the process, she spilled the entire cup of coffee on her lap. Liebeck was wearing cotton sweatpants; they absorbed the coffee and held it against her skin, scalding her thighs, buttocks, and groin.|$|E
25|$|At Springfield Elementary, Skinner is despondent at {{the thought}} that Edna could leave the school. Groundskeeper Willie lends Skinner his sports <b>car</b> <b>so</b> he can go to Orlando, where he surprises Edna with a kiss under the {{fireworks}} display. They are interrupted by Agnes, whom Skinner brought along, much to Edna's ire. During preparation for the awards ceremony, Skinner is shocked when he hears that the winner receives enough money to be able to retire. He requests Bart to help him sabotage Edna's chances of winning, though he has to resort to blackmail after Bart initially refuses. At the ceremony, each finalist must ask their nominating student a question. When Bart is asked what Edna would like to teach the world, he pretends to be illiterate, until Skinner tells the truth. Skinner asks Edna to marry him, and she agrees. Edna loses the award, but looks forward to marrying Skinner.|$|E
50|$|In 1921 new trains were {{introduced}} on the Underground's Piccadilly line with air-operated sliding doors.

25|$|Conspiring {{with his}} mentor Gilliam and second-in-command Edgar, Curtis Everett plans {{to lead the}} tail {{passengers}} in a revolt that will take {{them all the way}} up to the engine. Mason and armed guards come to take two small children, Andy and Timmy. Andy's father Andrew attempts to fight back, but is punished by Mason by being forced to put his arm into the extreme cold outside the train, effectively amputating it. Enraged, Curtis initiates their plan the next time they are to be fed, taking the security and prison cars. Curtis releases security expert Namgoong Minsu and his clairvoyant daughter Yona from the prison <b>car</b> <b>so</b> he can disable the locks between cars, offering them a hallucinogenic drug called Kronole as payment. They take the car where insects are ground up to make their protein bars, and Gilliam suggests that if they take the subsequent water supply car, they will control any negotiation with Wilford. Instead, they are ambushed by a mass of masked men with hatchets led by Franco the Elder under Mason's orders; after a bloody battle Curtis sacrifices Edgar to win the fight. Mason is taken captive and Curtis, Namgoong, Yona, Tanya, Andrew and Gilliam's bodyguard Grey continue on with her as a hostage.|$|E
25|$|Coulthard, Berger and Alesi's {{cars had}} been damaged beyond {{immediate}} repair; {{all three were}} thus forced to race their teams' spare cars, vindicating Ferrari's customary Monaco practice of bringing an additional car for each driver. Berger's spare car, however, was fitted with an earlier-specification engine that did not produce quite as much power as his race car or Alesi's spare car, whilst the throttle on Coulthard's car was not fully calibrated {{in the rush to}} ready it for the restarted race. Irvine's Jordan and Boullion's Sauber were repaired, and the other drivers stuck at the first corner were able to restart their cars, apart from Salo and Schiattarella: the former's Yamaha engine overheated in the jam, requiring him to take the restart from the pit-lane in the spare Tyrrell, and the latter's Simtek was damaged by marshals attempting to move it from the scene of the accident. The impoverished team lacked a spare <b>car,</b> <b>so</b> Schiattarella could not take any further part in the race, and Simtek's participation in the event was endedwithout either car completing a racing lapwhen Verstappen's car suffered a recurrence of its persistent gearbox problems and was pushed into the pit-lane {{as the rest of the}} field embarked upon the second formation lap.|$|E
25|$|The show {{went into}} hiatus late in 1979 when Garner {{was told by}} his doctors {{to take time off}} because of {{numerous}} knee injuries and back trouble, as well as an ulcer. He sustained the former conditions largely because of his insistence on performing most of his own stunts, especially those involving fist fights or car chases. Because of his physical pain, Garner eventually opted not to continue with the show some months later, and NBC cancelled the program in mid-season. It was alleged that Rockford had become very expensive to produce, mainly due to the location filming and use of high-end actors as guest stars. According to sources, NBC and Universal claimed the show was generating a deficit of several million dollars, a staggering amount for a nighttime show at the time, although Garner and his production team Cherokee Productions claimed the show turned a profit. Garner told a story to Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show that the studio once paid a carpenter $700 to build a shipping crate for a shoot-out on a boat dock, though there were shipping crates on the dock. The script often called for Garner to damage his <b>car,</b> <b>so</b> the car could be sold, repaired, and repurchased for each episode.|$|E

500|$|On a state {{television}} show, Ministry of Interior spokesman Tariq Al-Hassan said that fiftypolice officers had been injured, including two with serious sword wounds and that [...] "one protester drove over police resulting in injuries including cutting-off fingers of a policeman {{before we could}} catch him." [...] He also denied policemen prevented ambulances from reaching Pearl Roundabout or attacked any paramedics, but instead: [...] "What happened is that protesters stole an ambulance <b>car,</b> <b>so</b> we were checking on every ambulance that reaches the roundabout." [...] One doctor working at SMC's ER supported the government's account, accusing protesters of attacking the Under-Secretary-of-State for Health, taking control of all hospital entrances and stealing an ambulance.|$|E
500|$|The cameras {{used during}} the chariot race also {{presented}} problems. The 70mm lenses had a minimum focusing distance of , and the camera was mounted on a small Italian-made <b>car</b> <b>so</b> the camera crew could keep {{in front of the}} chariots. The horses, however, accelerated down the [...] straight much faster than the car could, and the long focal length left Marton and Canutt with too little time to get their shots. The production company purchased a more powerful American car, but the horses were still too fast, and even with a head start, the filmmakers only had a few more seconds of shot time. As filming progressed, vast amounts of footage were shot for this sequence. The ratio of footage shot to footage used was 263:1, one of the highest ratios ever for a film.|$|E
500|$|The {{interior}} of the P4/5 was designed by Glickenhaus himself with an iPod nano stereo and a tablet PC which features not only GPS but a 3D model of the car {{as well as a}} complete parts list and manual for easy servicing. The P4/5 also sports improved air conditioning over the Enzo and a high-strength alloy roll bar redesigned because the original was too thick and obstructed Glickenhaus' view. The seats are custom built, Glickenhaus' and his son's bodies were scanned so Pininfarina could mould the seats for their comfort, accessibility and view of the road (as with race cars). With a frame of carbon fibre composite, the seats are covered with a black mesh and red leather as selected by Glickenhaus' daughter. Pininfarina rearranged the wiring of the <b>car</b> <b>so</b> as to make the car easier to service and [...] lighter than the Enzo.|$|E
25|$|Horses were {{occasionally}} used to pull boats, {{but they}} did not last as long as mules. In the 1900s, a large white horse was used in Cumberland basin like a switching engine, to pull coal <b>cars</b> <b>so</b> that the coal could be loaded into the canal boats.|$|R
