40|$|This {{study was}} carried out {{to look at the}} {{utilization}} of <b>cowpea</b> - based diets on performance characteristics and haematology of broiler chickens. Raw <b>cowpea</b> (Vigna unguigulata L.

A total of seventy five day old broiler chicks of Marshall Strain were allotted into five dietary treatments. Marginal reductions in the crude protein, crude fibre, ether extract and ash were obtained in the dehulled <b>cowpea</b> and dehulled - cooked <b>cowpea</b> grains respectively. The dehulled - roasted <b>cowpea</b> grains however gave slight increases in the proximate composition. Feed intake and growth was significantly reduced in birds fed raw <b>cowpea</b> and dehulled - <b>cowpea</b> respectively. The feed conversion efficiency (FCE) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) also followed a similar pattern. Non-significant differences were however obtained in weight gain, FCE and PER of birds fed the control diet and those fed dehulled - cooked <b>cowpea</b> in this study. Birds fed dehulled - roasted <b>cowpea</b> also had marginal reductions in weight gain, FCE and PER when compared to those fed dehulled - cooked <b>cowpea</b> based diet. Mortality was higher in birds fed raw <b>cowpea</b> - based diet. The haematological studies showed lower values of haemoglobin, red blood cells, packed cell volume and white blood cells of birds fed raw <b>cowpea</b> and dehulled <b>cowpea</b> respectively. However, despite the better response indices, the combination of dehulling and cooking led to leaching of some water-soluble food nutrients.

40|$|Cowpea-maize {{intercropping}} causes low {{yields of}} <b>cowpea</b> due to shading effect by maize plants. Staggering of dates of planting of <b>cowpea</b> in an intercrop {{is a potential}} way of reducing intercrop shading while increasing <b>cowpea</b> yield. Nonetheless, contrasting <b>cowpea</b> cultivars may have differential response to planting dates. A field trial was conducted in 2008 and 2009 growing seasons at Samaru in Nigerian Guinea savannah to determine the performance of diverse <b>cowpea</b> cultivars intercropped with maize 4, 6 and 8 weeks after planting maize. The trial was {{laid out in a}} split-split-plot design. Grain yield and crop value were stable (1, 110. 5 - 1, 163. 5 kg ha- 1, $ 2, 379. 3 - 2, 566. 8 ha- 1, respectively) among planting dates. Sole <b>cowpea</b> was more productive than intercropped <b>cowpea</b> for number of branches (11 vs. 5 m- 2), peduncles (41 vs. 24 m- 2), pods (69 vs. 48 m- 2) and seed (569 vs. 406 m- 2), fodder yield (2685 vs. 1889 kg ha- 1) and grain yield (1479 vs. 797 kg ha- 1). Number of pods and seeds, seed weight and fodder yield were positive key traits of <b>cowpea</b> grain yield. Rankings of <b>cowpea</b> cultivars in terms of grain yield did not change with cropping system suggesting that <b>cowpea</b> cultivars that have superior yield in sole crops can be recommended for intercropping with maize. Grain yield of intercropped <b>cowpea</b> and crop value of maize plus <b>cowpea</b> and that of intercropped <b>cowpea</b> were highest for late maturing and indeterminate <b>cowpea.</b> Therefore, late and indeterminate <b>cowpea</b> cultivars should be preferred for intercropping with maize.
