50|$|Several {{aspects of}} Basel III reflect a macroprudential {{approach}} to financial regulation. Indeed, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision acknowledges the systemic significance {{of financial institutions}} in the rules text. More concretely, under Basel III banks' capital requirements have been strengthened and new liquidity requirements, a leverage cap and a countercyclical <b>capital</b> <b>buffer</b> have been introduced. Also, {{the largest and most}} globally active banks are required to hold more and higher-quality capital, which is consistent with the cross-section approach to systemic risk.|$|E
50|$|Participating {{financial}} institutions also forecasted internal {{resources available to}} absorb losses, including pre‐provision net revenue and the allowance for loan losses. As part of the supervisory process, the supervisors met with senior management at each financial institution to review and discuss the institution’s loss and revenue forecasts. Based on those discussions, the supervisors assessed institution‐specific potential losses and estimated resources to absorb those losses under the baseline and more adverse case, and determined whether the institution had a sufficient <b>capital</b> <b>buffer</b> necessary to ensure it had the amount and quality of capital necessary to perform its vital role in the economy.|$|E
