40|$|Abstract: Many {{problems}} in adaptive control {{can be divided}} into two parts; the first part is the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> dynamics, and the second is the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> disturbance. Very often, a single system is utilized to achieve both <b>of</b> these <b>control</b> objectives. The approach of this paper treats each problem separately. <b>Control</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> dynamics can be achieved by preceding the plant with an adaptive controller whose transfer function is the inverse of that <b>of</b> the <b>plant.</b> <b>Control</b> plant disturbance can be achieved by an adaptive feedback process that minimizes plant output disturbance without altering plant dynamics. The adaptive controller is implemented using adaptive filters. Copyright Â© 1998 IFAC...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the significance of corporate awareness in initiating an effective Emergency Response Plan (ERP) at a manufacturing company in Senawang, Negeri Sembilan. Five independent variables were used to justify its relationship with corporate awareness: roles and responsibilities, chain <b>of</b> command, <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant,</b> training and liaison with emergency services. A total number of 210 employees were chosen as respondents for the study but only 145 employees responded to the survey. The Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine if there was a significant relationship between corporate awareness and all the independent variables. The findings showed positive relationship between corporate awareness and all the independent variables (roles and responsibilities, chain <b>of</b> command, <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant,</b> training and liaison with emergency services). Multiple regressions showed that only chain <b>of</b> command, <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> and liaisons with emergency services were significant predictors of corporate awareness.

Several experiments have shown that they {{can be used as a}} very efficient tool for <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> pathogenic bacteria. The fact that they are widespread natural bacterial enemies, simple for cultivation and management, host-specific, suitable for integration with other control practices, human and environment friendly, provide a great advantage for the application of phages over other bactericides...|$|R
30|$|There are {{different}} species of Botrytis related to onions in storage, but the rot encouraged by B. allii causes the greatest commercial loss. The umbel blight disease caused by B. allii was estimated as a subversive disease affecting the yield of onion seeds (Hussein et al. 2014). It is important to avoid {{the application of the}} chemical pesticides in the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> diseases, and the organic production of the crops should be encouraged. Biological control is an alternative method to the fungicides that achieved remarkable success in the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> disease (Reddy et al. 2014).

40|$|Covering {{red currant}} during the {{development}} of the fruits guarantees high quality fruits and delays picking time. Because of these reasons the number of fruit growers using cover production system is increasing. Covering red currant aff ects fungicide action and effi cacy. Furthermore the climate conditions are altered in the shrub resulting in a diff erent infection risk/pressure for certain fungal diseases. Th e eff ect of the timing of covering on the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> Botrytis cinerea which is the cause of the mayor fruit rot disease of red currants was studied. Th e results from the trials clearly show the positive eff ect of covering during bloom on the chemical <b>control</b> <b>of</b> Botrytis on red currant. Th e chemical <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> during bloom which were covered from bloom equals that of a full season chemical <b>control</b> <b>of</b> uncovered <b>plants</b> or plants covered aft er fruit set.
