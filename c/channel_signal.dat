25|$|WFAA (AM), {{which would}} {{eventually}} {{serve as the}} sister radio station to WFAA television, first signed on the air on June 26, 1922. The station had long participated in a time-sharing arrangement with Fort Worth radio station WBAP, which was maintained as the latter operated at various frequencies; it originally began in 1922, when WBAP (which first {{went on the air}} on May 2 of that year, nine weeks before WFAA began operations) transmitted at 630kHz and continued until 1927, before resuming when that station moved to 800kHz in 1929 and settling when WBAP moved its current frequency at 820kHz in 1941. In 1947, WFAA and WBAP began time-sharing on a second frequency, 570kHz, which was formerly occupied by KGKO. Until WFAA (AM) began to transmit full-time on 570kHz in 1970, WBAP and WFAA were engaged in the somewhat bizarre situation of having to switch {{back and forth between the}} 570 and 820 frequencies at various times of the day: WBAP broadcast on 820 AM from midnight to 6:00a.m., with WFAA taking over the frequency space until noon; WBAP returned to the 820 signal for a few hours, before WFAA once again took over the frequency. WFAA had control over 820 during prime evening hours, when the 50,000-watt clear <b>channel</b> <b>signal</b> could often be heard as far west as California and as far east as New York (at the time, there were significantly fewer radio stations that were operating at night, reducing the likelihood of interference).|$|E

50|$|Dolby Headphone is a {{technology}} developed by Lake Technology (Australia), that later sold marketing rights to Dolby Laboratories, {{sometimes referred to}} as Mobile Surround, which creates a virtual surround sound environment in real-time using any set of two channel stereo headphones. It takes as input either a 5.1 or a 7.1 <b>channel</b> <b>signal,</b> a Dolby Pro Logic II encoded 2 <b>channel</b> <b>signal</b> (from which 5 or 7 channels can be derived) or a stereo 2 <b>channel</b> <b>signal.</b> It sends as output a 2 channel stereo signal that includes audio cues intended to place the input channels in a simulated virtual soundstage.|$|E
30|$|In this section, we {{investigate}} a quantitative comparison of two VoIP scheduling schemes {{from the control}} <b>channel</b> <b>signaling</b> overhead point of view. However, in the proposed resource sharing scheme each paired user must know {{the authority of the}} shared resources to perform according to the proposed scenario. Therefore, one concern for the proposed scheme is the additional control <b>channel</b> <b>signals.</b> The paired user's control channel information for ACK/NACK channel needs to be once transmitted in the first time when the voice radio bearer is established. Therefore, the achievable capacity gains using the proposed scheduling are enough even if the additional control <b>channel</b> <b>signaling</b> overhead is taken into account, since the additional control <b>channel</b> <b>signals</b> are a very small quantity.|$|R

30|$|However, {{downlink}} control <b>channel</b> <b>signaling</b> is classified {{into two groups}} to support uplink services. The first group is used to indicate the assigned RB's information. It contains some user specific signals such as user identification (UEID), cyclic redundancy check (CRC), RB assigned frequency-domain location, assignment time-domain duration, modulation, coding, and payload size [2]. Also, this control <b>channel</b> <b>signaling</b> is required {{at the beginning of}} each first transmission TTI because of the synchronous HARQ in E-UTRA uplink. The second is used to assign RBs in order to apply ACK/NACK information for uplink data.|$|R
30|$|Since the eNB handles a {{large portion}} of VoIP users, the amount of the {{required}} control <b>channel</b> <b>signals</b> for voice services increases significantly. It is critical that the control <b>channel</b> <b>signaling</b> overhead is minimized as much as possible. Therefore, for voice services, this paper focuses on the persistent resource assignment with the static control signaling. The persistent scheduling is mainly aimed for the voice services. It has been discussed for E-UTRA as a solution to overcome the limitation of layer 1 /layer 2 (L 1 /L 2) control channels.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to an application filed in September 1986 by Holy Ground Broadcasting, Inc., the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a construction permit for a new radio station on 700 kHz with 5,000 watts of power on February 21, 1990.
