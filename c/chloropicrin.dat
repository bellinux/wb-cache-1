50|$|In California {{experience}} with acute effects of <b>chloropicrin</b> when {{used as a}} soil fumigant for strawberries and other crops led {{to the release of}} regulations in January 2015 creating buffer zones and other precautions to minimize exposure of farm workers, neighbors, and passersby.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008 the US EPA re-approved <b>chloropicrin</b> as {{safe for}} use in {{agricultural}} settings, stating that treatments [...] "can provide benefits to both food consumers and growers. For consumers, it means more {{fresh fruits and vegetables}} can be cheaply produced domestically year-round because several severe pest problems can be efficiently controlled." [...] To ensure <b>chloropicrin</b> is used safely, the EPA requires a strict set of protections for handlers, workers, and persons living and working in and around farmland during treatments. EPA protections were increased in both 2011 and 2012, reducing fumigant exposures and significantly improving safety. Protections include the training of certified applicators supervising pesticide application, the use of buffer zones, posting before and during pesticide application, fumigant management plans, and compliance assistance and assurance measures.|$|E

50|$|The {{tetravalent}} moiety CO4 {{is found}} in stable organic compounds; they are formally esters of orthocarbonic acid, and therefore are called orthocarbonates. For example, ethyl orthocarbonate can be prepared by the reaction between <b>chloropicrin</b> and sodium ethoxide in ethanol. Polyorthocarbonates are stable polymers that might have applications in absorbing organic solvents in waste treatment processes, or in dental restorative materials. The explosive trinitroethylorthocarbonate possesses a orthocarbonate core.|$|E

50|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{of various types}} of respirators was measured in laboratories and in the workplace. These measurements showed that in practice, the {{effectiveness of}} negative pressure tight fitting respiratory protective devices (RPD) depends on leakage between mask and face, rather than the filters/canisters. This decrease in efficiency due to leakage manifested {{on a large scale}} during World War I, when gas masks were used to protect against chemical weapons. Poor fit or poorly situated masks could be fatal. The Russian army began to use short-term exposure to chlorine at low concentrations to solve this problem in 1917. Such testing helped convince the soldiers that their gas masks were reliable - because respirators were a novelty. Later, industrial workers were trained in gas chambers in the USSR (in preparation for the Second World War), and late'. German firefighters used a similar test between the First and Second World Wars. Diluted <b>chloropicrin</b> was used to test industrial gas masks. The Soviet Army used <b>chloropicrin</b> in tents with a floor space of 16 square meters.|$|E

5000|$|National Filling Factory No. 23, Chittening, South Gloucestershire. Operated by Nobel Explosives, shells were {{initially}} filled with <b>chloropicrin.</b> From June 1918, alongside the main plant at Banbury and a secondary plant at Hereford, supplied with dichloroethyl sulphide from the National Smelting Company at Avonmouth Docks, the three plants produced mustard gas shells. By November 1918, Chittening had produced 85,424 mustard gas shells; {{but at a}} human cost of 1213 cases of associated illness, including two deaths which were later attributed to influenza.|$|E
50|$|Britain used a {{range of}} poison gases, {{originally}} chlorine and later phosgene, diphosgene and mustard gas. They also used relatively small amounts of the irritant gases chloromethyl chloroformate, <b>chloropicrin,</b> bromacetone and ethyl iodoacetate. Gases were frequently mixed, for example white star was the name given to a mixture of equal volumes of chlorine and phosgene, the chlorine helping to spread the denser but more toxic phosgene. Despite the technical developments, chemical weapons suffered from diminishing effectiveness as the war progressed because of the protective equipment and training which the use engendered on both sides.|$|E
