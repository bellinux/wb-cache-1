40|$|A {{total of}} 434 Escherichia coli {{isolated}} from septicemic calves between 1958 and 1965 and 430 E. coli isolated from diarrheic calves between 1967 and 1970 were studied by <b>colony</b> <b>hybridisation</b> and PCR assays {{for the presence}} of the cnf 1 - and the cnf 2 -like genes. They were also studied {{for the presence of}} genes coding for putative virulence factors associated with the CNF toxins including F 17 -, Pap- and Sfa-fimbrial adhesins and the recently described CDT-III toxin and AfaVIII-afimbrial adhesin. Thirty (7 %) of the 434 septicemic strains were positive for CNF by <b>colony</b> <b>hybridisation.</b> Twenty-six were confirmed as necrotoxigenic E. coli type 2 (NTEC 2) and four as NTEC 1 by PCR. Thirty-five (8 %) of the 430 diarrheic strains were positive for CNF by <b>colony</b> <b>hybridisation.</b> Five of them were studied by PCR and confirmed as NTEC 1. The 26 septicemic NTEC 2 strains and 20 of the 35 diarrheic NTEC including three of the five NTEC 1 were positive for CDT-III. All adhesins studied were present in NTEC as well as in non-NTEC. NTEC 1 were mainly Pap-, Sfa- and/or Afa 8 -positive, whereas NTEC 2 were mainly F 17 - and/or Afa 8 -positive. This study shows that necrotoxigenic E. coli with their associated adhesins and toxins were present in calves as early as 1958, but their prevalence seems to have increased since that time.

40|$|Abstract- <b>Colony</b> <b>hybridisation</b> and {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) procedures were used to look for nicotine dehydrogenase genes (ndh) in nicotinophilic microorganisms. Positive results were shared within Arthrobacter species, whereas distinction from other strains, using a different nicotine degradation pathway, was confirmed. Amplifications per-formed by several primer combinations and partial sequences of amplified fragments showed a variability of the ndh gene within Arthrobacter spp. The presence of the whole ndh gene was demonstrated using a set of primers designed to find the intergenic region and the contiguous 6 -hlno gene.

40|$|Background: Acinetobacter baumannii is an {{important}} etiological agent causing nosocomial infections. High level of resistance for different kind of antimicrobials has been observed, including ß-lactam antibiotics. This feature, chromosomal or plasmid encoded, has been associated to integrons harbouring antibiotic resistance gene cassettes. Aims: To investigate the presence of integrons among clinical isolates resistant to third generation cephalosporins (3 GC). Material and methods: One hundred A. baumannii strains isolated from several Chilean hospitals were included in this study. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 3 GC by an agar dilution method were carried out. Integrons class 1, 2 and 3 were investigated by <b>colony</b> blot <b>hybridisation</b> and confirmed by PCR. Results: High level of resistance to all assayed 3 GC was observed. On the other hand, integrón class 2 was the most prevalent (77 % of isolates) followed by integron class 1 (52 %). Forty six percent of isolates hybridised with probes for both of them. However, no positive hybridisation was detected for integron class 3. Conclusions: Nevertheless, most isolates harboured one or both class of integron; there was no direct relationship between {{the presence of these}} genetic structures and the resistance to this kind of ß-lactam antibiotics.

40|$|We {{studied the}} structure, {{organization}} and relationship of repetitive DNA sequences in the genome of the scallop, Pecten maximus, a bivalve {{that is important}} both commercially and in marine ecology. Recombinant DNA libraries were constructed after partial digestion of genomic DNA from scallop with PstI and ApaI restriction enzymes. Clones containing repetitive DNA were selected by hybridisation to labelled DNA from scallop, oyster and mussel; <b>colonies</b> showing strong <b>hybridisation</b> only to scallop were selected for analysis and sequencing. Six non-homologous tandemly repeated sequences were identified in the sequences, and Southern hybridisation with all repeat families to genomic DNA digests showed characteristic ladders of hybridised bands. Three families had monomer lengths around 40 bp while three had repeats characteristic of the length wrapping around one (170 bp), or two (326 bp) nucleosomes. In situ hybridisation to interphase nuclei showed each family had characteristic numbers of clusters indicating contrasting arrangements. Two of the repeats had unusual repetitions of bases within their sequence, which may relate {{to the nature of}} microsatellites reported in bivalves. The study of these rapidly evolving sequences is valuable to understand an important source of genomic diversity, has the potential to provide useful markers for population studies and gives a route to identify mechanisms of DNA sequence evolution. 1337...|$|R

Two clones were identified which together contained a complete copy of prochymosin mRNA. The nucleotide sequence is in substantial agreement with the reported amino acid sequence of prochymosin and shows that this protein has a mol. wt. of 40431 and chymosin a mol. wt. of 35612.

40|$|A PCR {{protocol}} {{was developed for}} the selective amplification of {{a segment of the}} ribosomal RNA operon in Pseudomonas strains. Two specific conserved sequences suitable for PCR priming were identified {{in the middle of the}} 16 S rDNA and at the very beginning of the 23 S rDNA respectively. As a result, amplified region includes the 3 ′ half of the 16 S rDNA with the whole 16 S– 23 S rRNA Internal Transcripted Spacer (ITS 1) sequence. The specificity of the primer set was checked on sequence databases and validated on collection strains and on one hundred soil bacterial isolates. Our results showed that both collection, soil-inhabiting Pseudomonas and some Pseudomonas -related Azotobacter DNAs could be amplified. This specific PCR for the detection of Pseudomonas strains was in good agreement with <b>colony</b> <b>hybridisation</b> using a Pseudomonas -specific probe. The targeted segment is relevant for a characterisation at the species (16 S rDNA) as well as at the infraspecific (ITS 1) levels.

40|$|Biological {{nitrogen}} fixation {{is an important}} process that allows nitrogen uptake into biological systems. But it is still unclear from where the first nif gene was formed or evolved. Soil samples from different agro-climatic zones of western Indian Himalaya were analysed for the diversity of nifH in their metagenome. Metagenomic DNA was isolated followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and quantification. Soil of Pithoragarh (locality of temperate climatic region) was fur-ther used for shotgun meta-genomic library construction. Clones having similar insert were screened and finally 176 clones were used for <b>colony</b> <b>hybridisation.</b> All the clones were hybridised with two nifH probes, i.  e.

40|$|The Mediterranean {{harvester}} ant species Messor minor, M. cf. wasmanni, and M. capitatus can co-occur in {{the same}} habitat. In Italian populations, we encountered colonies that contained workers {{from more than one}} species as identified via standard morphology, as well as colonies with workers that appeared to be morphologically intermediate between species. This unusual finding required further analysis. We analysed such colonies using microsatellites, mitochondrial DNA and refined morphometrics, and a simple inference key for the colony-level interpretation of data from the three sources combined. We infer that Messor minor and M. cf. wasmanni engage in bidirectional interspecific gene flow. Hybrids between these two species are inferred to produce fertile offspring, which would indicate that barriers to hybridisation do not exist or can be completely overcome. This is unexpected, given that they are non-sister species and broadly sympatric in nature. Our findings also indicate the possible occurrence of hybrid-hybrid crosses, a phenomenon rarely observed in ants. We cautiously interpret the data at hand as in support of the interspecific gene flow considerably shaping the genetic makeup of populations, raising the question about a potential adaptive value of this hybridisation. Messor capitatus mixes with hybrids of the other two species, but we found no indication of hybridisation involving this species. We discuss various hypotheses on the causations of <b>colony</b> mixing and <b>hybridisation</b> in the three Messor species at the proximate and ultimate level...|$|R
40|$|Gridded genomic {{libraries}} {{are crucial}} for the positional candidate gene approach. For this purpose we constructed a gridded genomic library from a female chicken using the vector sCos 1. About 110 000 cosmid clones were grown and replicated in 384 -well plates. An average insert size of 39 kb was calculated from the analysis of 68 randomly selected clones. No chimerism could be observed from 31 in situ hybridisations. One replica of the library (number 125) has been transferred to the Resource Centre/Primary Database (RZPD) of the German Human Genome Project (DHGP). The whole library was gridded onto four nylon filters at high density for efficient identification of cosmid clones by <b>colony</b> <b>hybridisation.</b> Twenty-two probes were used for screening the library {{and each of them}} gave at least one positive signal.

40|$|Chimeraplasty {{or the use}} of {{chimeric}} RNA/DNA oligonucleotides (RDOs) {{to correct}} single-base mutations emerged in the field of gene therapy with reported base pair conversions of up to 40 %. We investigated the applicability of chimeraplasty to correct a point mutation in the von Willebrand Factor (VWF) gene resulting in a von Willebrand Disease (VWD) type 3 phenotype. Although we have access to VWD type 3 dogs, we used wild type endothelial cells for in vitro studies, as isolation of endothelial cells from VWD type 3 dogs is not straightforward due to the bleeding diathesis. RDOs to convert the wild type VWF gene into VWD type 3 gDNA were constructed and used in various transfection conditions. However, no gene conversion could be detected either in the RNA or in the DNA isolated from transfected cells, not even with the sensitive <b>colony</b> <b>hybridisation</b> technique, despite the presence of RDOs in the cell nucleus. On the other hand, sequence analysis of isolated DNA of transfected cells did reveal the presence of VWF type 3 DNA.

40|$|In 2002, the Environmental Risk Management Authority of New Zealand (ERMANZ or the Authority) {{approved}} {{an application}} {{by the company}} AgResearch, Ltd. to create and dispose of genetically modified (GM) bovine. As part of its risk management strategy, the Authority imposed a requirement for monitoring soil microorganisms for uptake of transgenes by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). HGT is routinely considered in biosafety risk assessment because {{it may be a}} process that underpins eventual adverse effects to human health or the environment. While granting approval to the company to make GM bovine, the Authority considered that HGT-related risks were potentially non-negligible and therefore approval was contingent upon meeting regulatory controls that made the risk negligible through risk mitigation. ERMANZ’s requirements placed upon AgResearch the burden to conduct a monitoring effort capable of delivering the risk mitigating activity that the Authority sought. Using <b>colony</b> <b>hybridisation</b> and PCR, AgResearch monitored antibiotic resistance phenotypes in soil bacteria cultured from samples of soil taken from offal pits containing the carcasses of GM bovine and surrounding control sites between 2004 and 2009 in an attempt to determine if any of the antibiotic resistance in soil bacteria was caused by the uptake of transgenes originally from the GM animals...|$|E

About 20 colonies, which gave an intense signal upon hybridisation with whole B. suis genomic DNA as a probe, were selected. Because of {{the high degree of}} DNA homology between B. suis and Brucella abortus, a short probe was chosen as it would more likely give species specificity. Of seven fragments selected to probe whole B. suis, B. abortus, and Yersinia enterocolitica DNA, one was found to hybridise with B. suis only. The probe was sequenced in two directions and sense and anti sense primers of 25 bp in length were chosen to yield a product of 421 bp. After optimisation of the PCR, a product of 420 bp was obtained with B. suis template DNA and two bands of 420 and 650 bp were detected with B. abortus template DNA. This is the first reported PCR of the Brucella genome where a single pair of primers will discriminate between B. suis and B. abortus.

40|$|Over a 12 month period, 588 cattle faecal {{samples and}} 147 farm {{environmental}} samples from three dairy farms in southeast Queensland were examined {{for the presence}} of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC). Samples were screened for Shiga toxin gene (stx) using PCR. Samples positive for stx were filtered onto hydrophobic grid membrane filters and STEC identified and isolated using <b>colony</b> <b>hybridisation</b> with a stx-specific DNA probe. Serotyping was performed to identify serogroups commonly associated with human infection or enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli were isolated from 16. 7 % of cattle faecal samples and 4. 1 % of environmental samples. Of cattle STEC isolates, 10. 2 % serotyped as E. coli O 26 :H 11 and 11. 2 % serotyped as E. coli O 157 :H 7, and the E. coli O 26 :H 11 and E. coli O 157 :H 7 prevalences in the cattle samples were 1. 7 and 1. 9 %, respectively. Prevalences for STEC and EHEC in dairy cattle faeces were similar to those derived in surveys within the northern and southern hemispheres. Calves at weaning were identified as the cattle group most likely to be shedding STEC, E. coli O 26 or E. coli O 157. In concurrence with previous studies, it appears that cattle, and in particular 1 - 14 -week-old weanling calves, are the primary reservoir for STEC and EHEC on the dairy farm.

40|$|Background—The {{development}} of clinical disease after infection with Helicobacter pylori {{has been reported}} to be associated with expression of the cagA gene. Recently, {{it has been shown that}} cagA is part of a multigene locus, described as the cag pathogenicity island (PAI). The role of this region in determining clinical outcome remains to be established.  Aims—To investigate whether the presence of cagA is always associated with the presence of the complete cag PAI and to evaluate the distribution of selected cag genes in 73 H pylori strains isolated from patients in France.  Methods—Clinical strains of H pylori were screened for selected genes of the cag PAI by polymerase chain reaction and <b>colony</b> <b>hybridisation.</b>  Results—Of 64 strains that harboured the cagA gene, 57 (89 %) also contained the entire cag PAI. The entire cag PAI was found in 85 % (48 / 56) and 53 % (9 / 17) of duodenal ulcer and non-ulcer dyspepsia isolates, respectively. Eight strains had deletions within the cag PAI, including deletion of the cagA gene in one isolate; the deletions were not associated with the insertion sequence IS 605. Of eight strains lacking the cag PAI, four were isolated from patients with duodenal ulcer.  Conclusion—The cag PAI is not a uniform, conserved entity. Although the presence of the cag PAI is highly associated with duodenal ulcer, the clinical outcome of infection with H pylori is not reliably predicted by any gene of the cag PAI. ...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the putative role of the more recently described beta 2 toxin. Seven hundred and fourteen non-enterotoxigenic type A C. perfringens isolated from 133 calves with lesions of enterotoxaemia and high clostridial cell counts (study population) and 386 isolated from a control population of 87 calves were tested by a <b>colony</b> <b>hybridisation</b> assay for the beta 2 toxin. Two hundred and eighteen (31 %) C perfringens isolated from 83 calves (62 %) of the study population and 113 (29 %) C. perfringens isolated from 51 calves (59 %) of the control population tested positive with the beta 2 probe. Pure and mixed cultures of four C perfringens (one alpha+beta 2 +, one alpha+enterotoxin- 1 and two alpha+) were tested in the ligated loop assay in one calf. Macroscopic haemorrhages of the intestinal wall, necrosis and haemorrhages of the intestinal content, and microscopic lesions of necrosis and polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell infiltration of the intestinal villi were more pronounced in loops inoculated with the a and beta 2 -toxigenic C. perfringens isolate. These results suggest in vivo synergistic role of the alpha and beta 2 toxins in the production of necrotic and haemorrhagic lesions of the small intestine in cases of bovine enterotoxaemia. However, isolation of beta 2 -toxigenic C. perfringens does not confirm the clinical diagnosis of bovine enterotoxaemia and a clostridial cell counts must still be performed.

40|$|Cloned genes, from Escherichia coli C, for the {{catabolism}} of homoprotocatechuate were available. The organisation {{and expression}} of these genes was investigated {{by a number}} of molecular genetic techniques. The exact position of the 5 ' end of one of the genes, hpcG, was determined by a combination of Southern blotting and DNA sequencing and subsequently used as a marker to aid the positioning and illucidation of the direction of transcription of the other genes. The genes were found to be arranged in two blocks of structural genes which were both transcribed in the same direction and a separate regulatory gene. Northern hybridisation analysis of RNA from wild type cells and from cells containing cloned genes indicated the presence of three transcripts of 4. 5, 2. 7 and 1. 6 kbp. A model for the position of the hpc genes, their regulation and number of transcriptional units is proposed. One of the catalytic proteins, CHMS dehydrogenase, was purified and some of its properties investigated; homology between the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of this enzyme and the equivalent protein from Klebsiella pneumoniae M 5 a 1 was very high. An oligonucleotide derived from shared protein sequence of the CHMS dehydrogenases from E. coli C and K, pneumoniae M 5 a 1 was used to investigate homology in related species by Southern hybridisation.

METHODS: A 1268 base pair DNA fragment, containing parts of the genes for E coli heat labile enterotoxin (LT) and heat stable enterotoxins (ST 1 a and ST 1 b), was random prime labelled with digoxigenin-dUTP. The labelled DNA {{was used as a}} probe in <b>colony</b> <b>hybridisation</b> reactions to examine 180 E coli strains of which 92 had previously been shown by a cell culture assay to produce LT. Six LT negative ST 1 positive E coli, 34 Verotoxin producing E coli (VTEC), and 84 organisms from other genera were also examined. All organisms other than VTEC were isolated from travellers returning from abroad with diarrhoea. All E coli strains were retested by cell culture for LT, and were tested by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for ST 1, and by the trivalent and individual DNA probes. RESULTS: All 81 isolates, that on retesting by cell culture were positive for LT, also hybridised with the trivalent and LT probes; 27 of these were also enzyme immunoassay (EIA) positive for ST 1 of which 24 hybridised with the ST 1 b probe and three with the ST 1 a probe. Of 99 isolates, that on retesting by cell culture were negative for LT, all were negative by LT probe and only three were EIA positive for ST 1; these three were positive by both trivalent and ST 1 b probes. Four isolates were positive by the trivalent probe but negative by cell culture and EIA; all four were positive by ST 1 b probe. Compared with the cell culture assay for LT, the probe had a sensitivity and specificity both of 100 %; compared with the EIA for ST 1, the probe had a sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 88 %.

40|$|Some Bacillus sphaericus strains (e. g. IAB 59, LP 1 G and 47 - 6 B) can {{overcome}} resistance in Culex mosquito larvae, raised against the well characterised binary toxin from this bacterium. A common spore protein (P 49), of approximately 49 kDa, produced by these strains {{has previously been}} proposed {{to be responsible for}} this toxicity. Protein fingerprint analysis of sporulated cultures of these strains identified a number of candidate toxins. Their N-terminal sequences were determined and used to design degenerate oligonucleotide probes. Southern blotting, cloning and <b>colony</b> <b>hybridisation</b> allowed the identification of clones containing genes encoding the putative toxins Cry 49 Aal (P 49) and Cry 48 Aal (P 135) from IAB 59. The 1, 395 bp cry 49 Aal gene encodes a protein of 53. 3 kDa, showing homology to BinA and BinB from B. sphaericus as well as Cry 36 Aal and the Cry 35 binary toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis. The 3, 534 bp cry 48 Aal gene encodes a 135. 6 kDa protein showing homology to the three-domain Cry toxins from B. thuringiensis, including the mosquitocidal Cry 4 Aa and Cry 4 Ba from B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis. Individual expression of these proteins in an acrystalliferous B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis strain, followed by bioassays against mosquito larvae revealed no toxicity. However, a Cry 48 Aal/Cry 49 Aal combination was toxic to both Bin-susceptible and Bin-resistant Culex quinquefasciatus larvae. Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae mosquito larvae were insensitive to the combination, as were a range of other dipteran, coleopteran and lepidopteran insects. The components of this novel binary toxin from B. sphaericus are highly conserved among strains able to overcome resistance. Differential processing of Cry 48 Aal by C. quinquefasciatus and A. aegypti larval gut proteinases is not responsible for the non-toxicity towards the latter mosquito. Cry 49 Aal and Cry 48 Aal form bipyramidal and amorphous crystals respectively at sporulation and their expression involves RNA polymerase factor cr 6 in B. subtilis. Discovery of Cry 49 Aal and Cry 48 Aal may prove central in the development of strategies to avoid resistance development against B. sphaericus in Culex populations...|$|E
