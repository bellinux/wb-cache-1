5|$|Following a {{break for}} {{the first part of the}} VB Series of One Day Internationals, England moved to Melbourne for the fourth Test. Unfortunately for Key, he fell for a duck in the first innings, trapped leg before wicket (lbw) second ball by fast bowler Brett Lee. With England {{following}} on, Key made a maiden half-century to ensure Australia had to bat again. He eventually fell just after the new ball was taken, <b>caught</b> <b>at</b> second slip for 52.|$|E

5|$|Indiana {{earned a}} first down with two rushes, but as before, Tech's defense {{stiffened}} and refused to allow a second as Tech's Bernard Basham sacked Paci for a loss. Indiana's punt was fair <b>caught</b> <b>at</b> the Tech 30-yard line as the quarter came to an end. With one quarter remaining {{in the game and}} neither team having scored in the third quarter, the score remained 2813.|$|E

5|$|Tech {{running back}} Dwayne Thomas gained nine {{yards on the}} first Tech play, then the Hokies earned their initial first down on an option run that gained three yards. After the first down, Druckenmiller threw an {{incomplete}} pass, then Thomas ran for a six-yard gain. On third down, a long pass downfield was knocked down by a Texas defender, and the Hokies punted back to Texas. The kick was fair <b>caught</b> <b>at</b> the 13-yard line, but Tech was penalized 15 yards for interfering with the catch.|$|E

5|$|The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs {{considered}} the cyclone {{as the worst}} to hit Myanmar since 1968. Damage totaled over K621million kyat ($99.2million USD). Officially, there were 236deaths in the country, although there were unconfirmed reports of a death toll as high as 1,000. In the city of Myebon alone, there were 139deaths. Most of the deaths were fishermen from Rakhine State <b>caught</b> <b>at</b> sea.|$|E
5|$|The kick {{was fair}} <b>caught</b> <b>at</b> the 34-yard line of Boston College. On {{the first play}} after the kick, Davis {{connected}} with Harris on a pass play {{that resulted in a}} 51-yard gain for the Eagles. At the Tech 15-yard line following the big gain, the Eagles lost one yard on a rushing play before Davis passed to Gunnell for a 16-yard gain and a touchdown. The extra point was good, and with 1:29 remaining in the first half, Virginia Tech's lead was cut to 14–7.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very limited}} data on reproduction. Young are {{probably}} born near {{the start of the}} rainy season, in November–December, when food is plentiful. Six bats were <b>caught</b> <b>at</b> the roost site in Kianjavato, of which only one was a male; this led Bates and colleagues to suggest that the species may be polygynous, with groups consisting of a male and multiple females.|$|E

Eight different players <b>caught</b> <b>at</b> least one pass, and the leading receiver, Justin Harper, hauled in fourcatches for 64yards and a touchdown. Receiver Josh Morgan, meanwhile, caught threepasses, bringing him to 122receptions for his career, passing Antonio Freeman for second place all-time at Virginia Tech. Ernest Wilford remains first in the Virginia Tech record book, with 126receptions.|$|E

After being informed by Abdul Sharif that Tariq has died, she agrees to marry Rasheed, a man eager to have a young and attractive second wife in hopes of having a son with her. When Laila gives birth to a daughter, Aziza, Rasheed is displeased and suspicious. This results in him becoming abusive towards Laila. Mariam and Laila eventually become confidants and best friends. They plan {{to run away from}} Rasheed and leave Kabul but are <b>caught</b> <b>at</b> the bus station. Rasheed beats them and deprives them of water for several days, almost killing Aziza.|$|E
5|$|As far as known, Oryzomys gorgasi has a disjunct {{distribution}} in northwestern South America, including Colombia, Venezuela, and Curaçao. In a 2009 paper, Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales speculated that its distribution may extend into Central America. The Colombian population is {{known from the}} holotype only, <b>caught</b> <b>at</b> Loma Teguerre (7°54'N, 77°W) in Antioquia Department, northwestern Colombia, near the Río Atrato, at about 1m above sea level. The location is apparently a freshwater swamp, and Hershkovitz suggested that O.gorgasi probably occurred throughout the swamp forests in the Río Atrato basin. On Curaçao, it is known from cave faunas at Tafelberg Santa Barbara, Noordkant, Ser'i Kura, and Hermanus. At Tafelberg Santa Barbara, it was found in association with introduced black rats (Rattus rattus), indicating that the population persisted {{at least until the}} first European contact in 1499.|$|E

5|$|Both sides had {{suffered}} severe damage and casualties, but both were also {{aware that the}} battle would inevitably be rejoined and so {{the aftermath of the}} British defeat was one of frenzied activity at Gibraltar, Algeciras and Cadiz. While the British and French squadrons conducted hasty repairs, the French and Spanish fleet at Cadiz was prepared for a rescue mission, a heavy squadron arriving at Algeciras on 12 July. As the squadron departed with Linois's squadron, it was attacked again by Saumarez's squadron at the Second Battle of Algeciras and <b>caught</b> <b>at</b> night by faster and more manoeuvrable ships, which resulted in the British inflicting heavy losses on the Spanish rearguard but failing to destroy the French squadron for a second time.|$|E
5|$|Davidson struck 46runs in {{the first}} innings of the Fourth Test in Adelaide, then tore his {{hamstring}} muscle after bowling only 3.4 overs. Australia, with a bowler short, was unable to force a win without him. The Fifth Test was on his home ground at Sydney with the series locked 1–1. He captured 3/43 and 3/80, taking a wicket with his final ball in Test cricket when Alan Smith was <b>caught</b> <b>at</b> slip by Bob Simpson. This left Australia with a target of 241 in 60 overs, but {{there was to be}} no fairytale finish as the match ended in a draw.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{different}} receivers <b>caught</b> <b>at</b> {{least one}} pass, with Dexton Fields leading all receivers {{in the game}} with sevencatches for 101yards. Both totals were the highest marks recorded in the game by either team. Fields was also the recipient of a play that tied for the longest pass play of the game, a 37-yard toss from Reesing halfway through the third quarter. Cornerback and game MVP Aqib Talib came into the game as a receiver several times, but because his appearance in the game was such an unusual occurrence, the Virginia Tech defense was able {{to zero in on}} him and prevent him from catching the ball.|$|E

5|$|French Admiral Pierre André de Suffren with a {{fleet of}} fifteen ships sailed from Trincomalee to support the besieged city on 10June. Arriving on 13June, the French found the British {{reluctant}} to fight, moving away and anchoring some five miles off. As {{the success of the}} siege would probably be decided by naval action, 1200 troops were embarked onto Suffren's ships to increase his gunnery complement. Having been frustrated by contrary winds, the French fleet was able to close with the British ships on 17June. Hughes, not wishing to be <b>caught</b> <b>at</b> anchor, weighed, and the two fleets began manoeuvring for advantage.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys dimidiatus {{is known}} from three {{specimens}} {{collected in the}} lowlands of the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region in southeastern Nicaragua. The first, an old male, was collected on November5, 1904, in a banana plantation with very moist red clay on the Río Escondido near El Rama. The second, a young adult male, was caught on July26, 1966, in dense cane on the south bank of the Río Mico at El Recreo, 15km (9mi) west from {{the location of the}} first specimen, along with three other rice rats (O.couesi, Melanomys caliginosus, and Oligoryzomys fulvescens), the cotton rat Sigmodon hirsutus, and the cottontail rabbit Sylvilagus brasiliensis. The third was <b>caught</b> <b>at</b> a stream near Bluefields. Reid suggested that the species is semiaquatic, spending some time in the water, like other Oryzomys.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the close}} {{similarity}} between play and hunting, cats prefer {{to play with}} objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, but rapidly lose interest (they become habituated) in a toy they have played with before. Cats also tend to play with toys more when they are hungry. String is often used as a toy, {{but if it is}} eaten, it can become <b>caught</b> <b>at</b> the base of the cat's tongue and then move into the intestines, a medical emergency which can cause serious illness, even death. Owing to the risks posed by cats eating string, it is sometimes replaced with a laser pointer's dot, which cats may chase.|$|E
