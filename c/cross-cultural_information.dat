It involves the formalization of factors that influence our spatial cognition {{to create a more}} effective representation of space. These improved models assist in a variety of issues, for example, the developing maps that communicate better, providing navigation instructions that are easier to follow, utilizing space more practically, accounting for the cultural differences on spatial thinking for more effective <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>information</b> exchange, and an overall increased understanding of our environment.|$|E

50|$|The {{interaction}} {{between humans and}} the environment is a major focus among the Geographers. Research has shown even though humans use maps to communicate, they seldom use these maps {{to arrive at the}} solution. The objective of this research area is to minimize the disparity between the environment and its geometric representation and the removal of spatial cognitive biases that are inherent. Examples of spatial cognitive biases include the overestimation of distance between two locations when there is a large number of intersections and nodes in the path. There is a tendency to recollect irregular streets or rivers as straighter, more parallel, or more perpendicular than they are. David Mark through his research illustrates how spatial features like inland water bodies (lakes, ponds, lagoons) are categorized differently in English and French speaking population, and therefore, could cause issues in <b>cross-cultural</b> geographical <b>information</b> exchange.|$|R
40|$|Prior {{research}} suggests that listeners from different cultural backgrounds appreciate music differently. Although music mood/emotion {{is an important part}} of music seeking and appreciation, few <b>cross-cultural</b> music <b>information</b> retrieval (MIR) studies focus on music mood. Moreover, existing studies on cross-cultural music perception often only compare listeners from two cultures, in most cases, Western vs. Non-western cultures. In order to fill these gaps, this study compares music mood perceptions of listeners from three distinct cultures: American, Korean, and Chinese. Our findings reveal that the perceptions of the three cultural groups are generally different, but in many aspects, Korean listeners are situated in between listeners from the two other cultures. This paper describes the comparison of the three cultural groups from the perspectives of mood perceptions, musical (stimuli) characteristics, and listeners' (subjects) characteristics.

40|$|Abstract. The {{long-term}} {{historical development}} and broad geographi-cal variation of Chinese character (Hanzi/Kanji) {{has made it}} a <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>information</b> sharing platform in East Asia. However, {{due to the lack}} of proper research framework, the integration of heterogeneous knowledge grounded in Hanzi and its variants has been a thorny problem. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for the knowledge rep-resentation of Hanzi in the cross-cultural context. Our proposal is mainly based on two resources: Hantology and Generative Lexicon Theory. Han-tology is a comprehensive Chinese character-based knowledge resource created to provide a solid foundation both for philological surveys and language processing tasks, while Generative lexicon theory is extended to catch the abundant knowledge information of Chinese characters within its proposed qualia structure. We believe that the proposed theoretical framework will have great influence on the current research paradigm of Hanzi studies, and help to shape an emergent model of intercultural collaboration...|$|E

Only negative forms of religion would imply negative outcomes. In the present chapter, such a conclusion is importantly nuanced.

Attention is paid to provide <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>information,</b> when available. In addition, I present a new study integrating the cognitive, emotional, personality, and moral factors involved with religious doubting in adolescence.

Adolescent religion seems to refl ect stability, conservation, engagement, and cohesion, but potentially somehow at the detriment of plasticity, openness, exploration, and autonomy – all important for optimal development. Complementing others’ argument that adolescence is a “sensitive” period for spiritual development, I argue that adolescence is also a “sensitive” period for religious doubting and agnosticism...|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{investigated}} {{the reliability and validity}} of the DAS-A in a sample of 308 Chinese adults in Hong Kong. Method: The reliability of the DAS-A and its relevant sub-scales was measured using internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and Guttman split-half reliability. Principal components analysis was performed to assess construct validity. Discriminant validity of the DAS-A was performed by examining whether the DAS-A could discriminate between the depressed and the non-depressed subjects in this study. Results: The split-half reliability of the DAS-A was found to be r = 0. 87; Cronbach's alpha was 0. 945; and item-total correlations ranged between 0. 36 and 0. 75. Factor analysis revealed three factors that were similar to those that were found in other studies: Performance Evaluation, Need for Approval, and Anaclitic Self-Esteem. Discriminant validity suggested that the DAS-A discriminated successfully between the non-depressed and the depressed groups. Nevertheless, some differences were noticed in the relative strength of the factors and in the distribution of the scale items into the three factors. Conclusion: It was hoped that with this type of <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>information,</b> the universality of the constructs of the DAS-A could be reliably demonstrated. © 2008, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Bicycles are {{ubiquitous}} {{and also}} globally {{a cornerstone of}} student transport and recreation. We have found that bicycles {{also serve as a}} transition vehicle of another sort. They serve as a technical platform that both encapsulates fundamental and interesting problems in mechanics, vehicle dynamics, stability, motive power, etc., and they are also something that university students have an intuitive, first-hand knowledge of from an early age.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} four ways to convey <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>information</b> in {{typically}} the academic context. First, an overview presents these four common approaches, {{which are the}} multicultural, the monocultural, the bicultural, and the experiential approach. The main part of this paper then demonstrates the experiential approach with most of its citations referring to the Japanese culture. This exercise builds the learners ’ personal involvement by forcing them to decide on a response to each cross-cultural encounter. Learners make choices by bringing to bear the totality of their background knowledge, their personal experiences, and their powers of intuition. In E. T. Hall’s (1981 a; 1981 b; 1982) pioneering work, that eventually evolved into the field of intercultural communications, he identified and explained cultural behavioral patterns, beliefs, values, attitudes and certain innate notions related to time, space, and silence. Hall’s literary style may be considered a multicultural approach since he collected examples from several, autonomous culture groups and even from ethnic groups within the United States to elucidate the cultural elements under examination. In the same vein, Stewart and Bennet (1991) categorized mainstream American values by comparing thoughts and actions to those present or absent in other culture groups.

40|$|Too often, all {{communication}} genres {{are analyzed}} without recognizing the unavoidable {{impact of a}} communicator’s cultural framework on producing, receiving, or attempting to comprehend the document. Differing cultural preferences, varying rhetorical styles and discourse patterns, in addition to linguistic elements, can easily cause information overload. This chapter analyzes the impact of culture on information overload, primarily using Hall’s high context versus low context model. We demonstrate that high and low context cultures correlate with typical discourse styles, using Kaplan’s model as an example. Hinds’ theory of Reader versus Writer Responsibility for comprehension provides further insights into possible causes of <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>information</b> overload. A shared professional and/or corporate culture may mitigate the cross-cultural issues in some cases, although it does not eliminate them. Cases from specific cultures—Latin American, Japanese, Chinese, and others—are used to demonstrate the issues discussed in this chapter. With so many textual elements acting as potential problems for international communicators, translating documents from one language to another is often not enough. Localization, or making a product linguistically and culturally appropriate for the target audience, makes {{an important contribution to}} reducing the cognitive load. The significant conclusion is that the major cause of information overload in cross-cultural situations is having to process information in different discourse patterns from different cultural frameworks.

Modern trends {{in the development of}} philology as a scientific field and a direction of professional training in the USA have been found out. Sociocultural peculiarities of philological education in the USA have been revealed. The essence of transformation processes in the philologists’ training at present time has been considered. They are: diversity and flexibility of educational programs; close relationship of higher education and linguistic communities; «major-minor» specialization; using of innovative forms and methods; reducing stress and increasing classroom time for independent students’ work; providing free access to education; improving elective education system; academic students’ mobility; implementing of «expert systems» into the quality of educational outcomes; creating conditions for ethnic minorities education. The transformation of the philological education system at conceptual, legal and normative, organizational and pedagogical, content-based, institutional and sociocultural levels has been analyzed.

It is considered a means to provide local communities, including indigenous people, with recognition of their cultural practices in the use and {{management of}} the natural resources within a protected area, while working together with governments to achieve conservation goals. However, implementation of effective joint management has often been difficult because capacities and expectations among partners differ. Here we explore the potential of using a participatory monitoring and evaluation approach as a means of not only agreeing among partners on the objectives of joint management but also of measuring progress toward those objectives. In particular, we first describe the process used to develop criteria and indicators for measuring joint management effectiveness of a protected area in the Northern Territory, Australia, involving the park&# 039;s Aboriginal Traditional Owners, their legal representatives, government, and researchers. We then analyze the process of applying a participatory approach to developing indicators and its contribution to improving equity among the partners. We consider the effectiveness of a participatory process {{within the context of the}} relationships, capacities, skills, communication, and <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>information</b> sharing. We found that at the early stages of joint management, the partners mostly identify process indicators related to human and social capital assets. Cross-cultural engagement in the early stages of the monitoring and evaluation cycle is challenged by issues relating to communication, institutional and community capacities, representation, and flexibility in ways of working together while learning by doing. We conclude, however, that a participatory monitoring and evaluation approach in which partners agree equally on the identification of criteria and indicators to measure agreed management outcomes has the potential of improving equitable participation, decision making and working relationships, which in turn will lead to improved park management effectiveness and community outcomes...|$|E

40|$|Background: Two Australian {{undergraduate}} speech pathology {{students completed}} {{a series of}} clinical placements working with people with complex communication needs in cross-cultural contexts. Aims: To describe the challenges that the students faced {{and how best to}} prepare future students for such experiences. Methods & Procedures: The students completed the placements in Thailand, Nepal, Bangladesh, India and South Africa. They used personal journaling to record their experiences. The students used the journals as the basis for reflective discussion when considering the challenges they experienced in applying their knowledge and skills. Outcomes & Results: The challenges were (1) to prepare adequately ahead of the placements; (2) to select appropriate models of service delivery; (3) to use existing service approaches, resources and infrastructure appropriately; (4) to access professional support; (5) to define their professional role; (6) to manage variable shared language proficiency; (7) to adapt personally; and (8) to work using an undergraduate level of knowledge, skills and experience. Conclusions: The students encountered challenges related to their clinical preparation and their capacity to adapt in both a professional and personal sense. Future students preparing to undertake such placements need to attain at least minimum clinical competencies before placements. They will be helped if they have some clinical experience in working with people with complex communication needs in <b>cross-cultural</b> contexts, <b>information</b> about the cultures they will visit, and if they set professional and personal learning goals for each clinical placement.

30|$|As {{interest}} in international electives increases, {{it is also}} important to understand the educational benefits to the participating residents and participating institutions. International experiences complement the academic missions of service, training, and research (Meara and Greenberg 2015). They offer exposure to advanced pathology while teaching residents how to utilize sparse resources efficiently and confer an increased understanding of cultural differences affecting health care delivery (Ozgediz et al. 2005; Oliphant et al. 2012; Jarman et al. 2009). Additionally, in the age of increasing work hour regulation, international work has the potential to maximize the acquisition and improvement of technical and clinical skills over a relatively short period of time (Shrime et al. 2015). Experience abroad also opens up new avenues for international surgical research addressing epidemiology, natural history, and cost-effective treatment of surgical conditions in LMICs (Meara and Greenberg 2015). While a majority of the literature focuses on benefits to resident education, hosting institutions also receive benefit from international exchanges. O’Donnell et al. (2014) found that hosting institutions for international residents found improvement in knowledge sharing, transfer of medical knowledge, and formation of long-term relationships (Lukolyo et al. 2015). These benefits were most pronounced when the residents were toward the end of their training and focusing on their future practice and research goals. These established relationships also build partnerships for collaborative research with the goal of improving international medical care. Additionally, trainees were found to positively affect patient care, staff education, and promoting professionalism at host institutions. Despite the mutual benefits, trainees do pose some challenges to host institutions including decreased efficiency and negative perceptions of hosting countries held by trainees. These and other challenges can be minimized by preparing residents prior to arrival to a host institution with education on medical, ethical, and cultural challenges that may be encountered during international experiences (O’Donnell et al. 2014; Kraeker and Chandler 2013; Howe et al. 2013). Overall, these collaborations and partnerships are gateways to facilitate <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>information</b> exchange and enhance worldwide quality of care (Shrime et al. 2015; Klaristenfeld et al. 2008).|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{identifies}} cultural {{indicators of}} Englishness through {{an analysis of}} readings of children's literature texts. These were taught on a children's literature course to Czech student-teachers at the Pedagogical Faculty, Brno in the Czech Republic from 1992 to 1995. The aim has been to identify cultural indicators of Englishness embedded in the texts and to reveal myths of national identity. This has been achieved by using a cross-cultural perspective whereby the Czech readings {{have been used to}} identify taken-for-granted aspects of English culture. The outcome has been to provide a paradigm for the exploration of culture in and through children's literature texts and to argue that children's literature should be incorporated into the Teaching of English as a Foreign Language and cultural studies for non-native speakers of English. In addition the methodological implications for the teaching of children's literature texts in the EFL classroom are discussed. The theoretical position which underpins the work is phenomenological in that it is an investigation of meanings. The readings by the Czech students and then the researcher were considered from two theoretical positions. An ethnographic perspective has been employed using the work of Geerz and Cohen to investigate the readings of three cohorts of Czech students who are outsiders to English culture. The reactions of the Czech students to the texts significantly reveal the legacy of the totalitarian system which began to end with the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989. Literary theory has been applied by the researcher to investigate the texts from an insider's perspective. Reader response theories involving the notion of the implied reader (Iser) and horizons of expectations (Jauss) are adopted to reveal and interrogate a culture's notions of childhood. It is established in the thesis that hitherto a sociological perspective has been taken with children's literature texts in the investigation of ideology with reference to class, race and gender. These have been oppositional readings which locate English children's literature as a site for the socialisation of children into the norms, values and beliefs of dominant society. It is argued in this thesis that by a careful investigation of the texts from a literary perspective and using the <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>information</b> gained, another view might be taken which is that English children's literature texts are less than normalising...|$|E

The result is a highly flexible system characterized by low barriers to entry and exit, geographic flexibility, low costs, rapid technological diffusion, high diversification through contract manufacturers and exceptional economies of scale and specialization. This paper analyses the causes behind the formation of such networks, their strategy, structure, dynamics and culture, taking into account areas such as strategic alliances between competitors, the permeable and diffuse nature of the network actors, the inherent paradox of collaborating with competitors, <b>cross-cultural</b> issues or <b>information</b> and communication technologies at the network level. This work will clarify and put these organizations in perspective and will analyze their evolution over the next few years. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Emoticons {{represent}} {{one of the}} non-verbal {{channels in}} computer-mediated communication. They are representative of facial expressions due to their similarity. This thesis examines and discusses evidence favouring universal equality and cultural differences in expressing emotions through emoticons in computer-mediated communication. Current research indicates that cultural differences in emoticon styles and usage exist. This is due to varying focus and importance of different face regions to display emotions. Eastern, collectivistic cultures focus on the eye-region while Western, individualistic cultures focus on the mouth region. This focus pattern is found in real life facial expressions {{as well as in}} typewritten symbolic emoticons. So far the most supported explanation for this phenomenon is differing cultural norms regarding the expression of emotional states. Another explanation proposed focuses on high versus low context dependency. While individualistic cultures display a low context dependency, collectivistic cultures are more context dependent. High context dependency is correlated with a higher usage rate of positive emotion displaying emoticons. Seeing how the Internet and social media have a global reach and impact, it is crucial to understand the cultural differences in verbal and non-verbal channels in the computer-mediated setting to enhance technology development and <b>cross-cultural</b> exchange of <b>information...</b>|$|R
40|$|Infosys Technologies Limited, the Bangalore-based {{information}} technology company, {{embarked on a}} global recruitment program in 2006. The first batch of recruits from U. S. universities {{were brought to the}} company's Mysore training facility in India and put through a rigorous 16 -week training program. By November 2007, the third U. S. batch was on campus for training along with the first batch from the U. K. Each of these batches had around 125 recruits. The company's CEO had charged Infosys' Head of Administration and Human Resources Development, Mohandas Pai, to step up the recruiting to around 1, 000 overseas recruits a year from countries such as the US, UK, continental Europe, and China as a way to globalize the workforce. Pai was concerned that this ambitious recruitment program would strain the company's training function. His concern stemmed {{from the fact that the}} trainers had to deal with cultural differences and varied learning styles of overseas recruits. The trainers had done a commendable job of making adjustments while training was ongoing, but Pai wondered if the same adjustments could be made when the scale of recruits increased dramatically. This case is useful for examining the issues of training capacity and <b>cross-cultural</b> training. Training, <b>information</b> technology, cross-culture...|$|R
