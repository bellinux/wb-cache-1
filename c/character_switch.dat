500|$|... "Great Big World" [...] was sung by Anne Hathaway and {{replaced}} another song called [...] "Woods Go-Round", which Edwards considered too childish and {{described as being}} [...] "in the vein of Saturday morning cartoons." [...] This change required the scene to be re-animated and re-cut. [...] "Be Prepared" [...] was sung by Benjy Gaither and developed out of a practicality; the filmmakers wanted to introduce Japeth while the character is {{rocking back and forth}} on his horns, as though the horns are a rocking chair. However, they realized that this would make the horns too big to fit in a minecart later on in the film. As a solution, they came up with the gag of having the <b>character</b> <b>switch</b> his horns several times, and this led to the song's concept.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{professional}} VTRs can [...] "burn" [...] (overlay) {{the tape}} timecode {{onto one of}} their outputs. This output (which usually also displays the setup menu or on-screen display) {{is known as the}} super out or monitor out. The <b>character</b> <b>switch</b> or menu item turns this behaviour on or off. The character function is also used to display the timecode on the preview monitors in linear editing suites.|$|E
50|$|The video {{begins with}} Dawson's <b>character</b> <b>Switch</b> {{as a young}} boy (played by Steele Stebbins) carving into a tree at the park. Next to him is his friend and love interest, young Brenda (played by Julia Lane). She rubs a few {{abrasions}} on her arm, and tells him she hates her father. To comfort her, Switch gives Brenda a necklace he made himself. She hugs him and thanks him for the gift. As they hug, a teenager who is her future boyfriend appears and takes Brenda away from him.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: This {{schematic}} {{shows the}} axis between two characters and the 180° arc on which cameras may be positioned (green). When cutting {{from the green}} arc to the red arc, the <b>characters</b> <b>switch</b> places on the screen.|$|R
50|$|The <b>character</b> <b>switching</b> {{from the}} {{previous}} games is still present, although character movement is different. Game characters can be given autonomous tasks and these are then executed independently by the game engine, without further need of player input.|$|R
50|$|Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 {{features}} gameplay akin to that {{of previous}} games in the series, in which players battle each other in 3D arenas. A returning feature which was omissed since the original Ultimate Ninja Storm {{is the ability to}} Wall Run. Players will be able to dynamically take to battle to the sides of the arenas, and battle on the walls of each stage. A major change to the feature is the ability to have one character be on the wall, while the other stays on the field. Originally the second player was automatically moved to the wall, to keep the battle flowing and the system in check. The option to select one of three different fighting types has been removed, which was introduced in Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution, restoring the previous system of Ultimate Jutsu and Awakenings seen {{in the rest of the}} series. Another new feature is the ability to swap characters during battle, similar to games like Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Awakenings and ultimate jutsus from previous games also return, and can now be shared between the switchable characters, meaning players can build up their meter with one <b>character,</b> <b>switch</b> to the other and use said abilities with the other character. However, the characters will now all share the same life bar. Also new to the franchise is the ability to break weapons and armor, both in free battle and boss battles. To support this, they have added the ability to create elemental damage; For example, fire can burn away clothing. Players can, however, get rid of the fire by moving around quickly throughout the area or by getting hit with water attacks.|$|E
5000|$|Splatoon was {{developed}} by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development. In mid-2013, {{one member of the}} Animal Crossing development team, Shintaro Sato, created a four-versus-four ink-based territory control game set in a featureless arena. After management approved making the prototype into a full game, the team started expanding its concepts, creating the ability to hide in ink, and wanted to somehow incorporate squids. After coming up with these ideas, the developers had trouble [...] "filtering it down" [...] to a [...] "simple, fun game." [...] Shigeru Miyamoto told the team that there was [...] "no appeal" [...] to the game in that state. Afterwards, the developers added the ability to hide in ink and verticality to the maps, but it still felt unfocused. The art director sketched different ideas for the player character, including animals, [...] "macho men," [...] robots, and Mario, but the co-directors wanted to include a playable squid. They also needed the character to be human in order to hold weaponry, but thought that a squid-human hybrid [...] "wouldn't sell". In January 2014, they realized they could make the player <b>character</b> <b>switch</b> between human and squid forms, which allowed them to come up with other ideas, such as swimming through ink or sustaining damage while maneuvering in enemy ink. From the beginning, the GamePad could display a real-time overview of the map so the player could see which team was ahead, and at some point, the team considered using urinals and sinks as warp points. The development team was determined to make interesting sound effects, so they repeatedly pounded slime to create the sound of a squid diving into ink.|$|E
5000|$|Todd Edwards wrote nine {{original}} {{songs for}} the film and sung four of them: [...] "Critters Have Feelings", [...] "Tree Critter", [...] "Eva Deanna", and [...] "Glow". [...] "Eva Deanna" [...] was written about a day {{that he and his}} wife spent at the zoo with their niece, the daughter of associate producer Katie Hooten."Great Big World" [...] was sung by Anne Hathaway and replaced another song called [...] "Woods Go-Round", which Edwards considered too childish and described as being [...] "in the vein of Saturday morning cartoons." [...] This change required the scene to be re-animated and re-cut. [...] "Be Prepared" [...] was sung by Benjy Gaither and developed out of a practicality; the filmmakers wanted to introduce Japeth while the character is rocking back and forth on his horns, as though the horns are a rocking chair. However, they realized that this would make the horns too big to fit in a minecart later on in the film. As a solution, they came up with the gag of having the <b>character</b> <b>switch</b> his horns several times, and this led to the song's concept.McWilliams joined Jim Belushi to sing [...] "The Schnitzel Song" [...] and Painter asked his longtime friend Ben Folds to sing [...] "Red is Blue", a selection strongly advocated for by Edwards. Folds was working on a new album at the time, but a year after the proposal, found the opportunity to record the song and compose a piano arrangement for it as well."Top of the Woods" [...] was sung by Andy Dick and was originally composed to be slow paced. The recording of Dick's performance was sped up though at the suggestion of Ralf Palmer, a prolific animator and friend of producer Sue Bea Montgomery.|$|E
50|$|Each item bought {{is placed}} at a {{specific}} place on the playground. By going across the railroad, Donald can call up one of his nephews (in practice, the player <b>character</b> <b>switches</b> from Donald to his nephew), and he can then play on the playground.|$|R
50|$|In earlier {{drafts of}} the script, the episode did not feature the <b>characters</b> <b>switching</b> to their {{opposite}} genders at all, nor {{the character of}} the Borax Kid. An original ending involved Amy's parents, Leo and Inez Wong, purchasing Planet Express and saving it from foreclosure.|$|R
50|$|The book {{received}} mostly critical acclaim, won the Goodreads Choice Award in 2011, {{and appeared}} on several bestseller lists. The book continues Riordan's use of third person narration, where chapters {{are from the}} point of view of one of the main <b>characters,</b> <b>switching</b> between Percy, Frank, and Hazel.|$|R

5000|$|Burns' radio debut was in 1988 on {{community}} radio station 3RRR {{on the program}} 'Lawyers, Guns & Money' as the character Sir Lunchalot. Later, the Sir Lunchalot <b>character</b> <b>switched</b> to commercial radio and became a regular Friday morning contributor to the 3AW breakfast show, providing humorous restaurant reviews and tips on dining etiquette.|$|R
5000|$|Beau's first {{appearance}} {{was in the}} season four opener, [...] "The Bundle From Britain", in which he returns from an extended stay in England to meet cousin Bart. Moore had earlier played a completely different role in the episode [...] "The Rivals", a drawing room comedy episode with Garner in which Moore's <b>character</b> <b>switched</b> identities with Bret.|$|R
50|$|Also {{unlike the}} first game, which was played with an {{unchangeable}} 5 member party (except for the summon), Summoner 2 only allows up to 3 characters {{to be in}} the party at once, although these characters can be picked from a group of 7. The main character Maia is usually required to remain in the party though, and some stages won't allow <b>character</b> <b>switching</b> at all.|$|R
5000|$|Wirehead - Wore {{a helmet}} that {{showed him the}} world {{as if it were}} an MUD, and through which he {{received}} instructions from his [...] "Dungeon Master". He could make weapons materialize instantly in his hand, as if he were a video-game <b>character</b> <b>switching</b> through his inventory. He was last seen defeated by Captain America and Daredevil, who destroyed Wirehead's helmet, and who presumably turned him over to law enforcement officials.|$|R
5000|$|The story {{follows the}} actions of the guerilla freedom fighters known as [...] "The Deloyer 7." [...] The war is fought across the planet Deloyer as the Federation vigorously pursues the rebels. The series is noted for its {{realistic}} use of not just the combat armors and support vehicles, but also military tactics. The series also followed a wide range of characters and political intrigue, with many shady <b>characters</b> <b>switching</b> sides throughout the series.|$|R
50|$|Edward Kelley {{is a minor}} {{character}} in Harry Turtledove's 2002 alternate history novel, Ruled Britannia, which is set in London a decade after its conquest by the Spanish Armada. Kelley is convicted of alchemy (with the apparent intention of financing Protestant rebels) and is burned in an auto-da-fe of the newly constituted English Inquisition in the first chapter. His desperate last call for help to witness William Shakespeare (the main <b>character)</b> <b>switches</b> the Spanish occupiers' attention to him.|$|R
5000|$|Gameplay {{is similar}} in style to Bradley's earlier Wizardry games. Players control a party of {{characters}} through a first-person perspective and fight turn-based combats. Outside of combat, the game is real-time. Characters can join guilds that give exclusive quests, and each character maintains their own individual quest log. [...] Guilds also allow <b>characters</b> to <b>switch</b> classes. <b>Characters</b> can <b>switch</b> classes {{as many times as}} they like but can not return to a class once they change from it.|$|R
5000|$|Bob Fleming, the ageing, incompetent West Country host of Country Matters, {{who has an}} {{extremely}} bad cough. His surname is a pun on phlegm-ing. Country matters is a Shakespearean euphemism for cunnilingus, from Hamlet. In addition to Bob, two of his friends - Clive Tucker, who can't stop shouting 'Arse!' (Whitehouse) and Jed Thomas, who can't stop sneezing (Williams) - make regular appearances on his show. These two <b>characters</b> <b>switched</b> names from series 2 onwards. (Higson, all series) ...|$|R
5000|$|Snow Wildsmith {{described}} the manga as [...] "enjoyable, {{but not all}} that memorable", but noted that the stereotypically [...] "blatantly gay" [...] chef could offend some readers. [...] Leroy Douresseaux felt the manga series had potential, but that the first volume was not [...] "anything really special". [...] Connie C. {{described the}} manga as being [...] "a cross between Antique Bakery and Princess Princess". [...] Matthew Warner felt {{it was fun to}} see the <b>characters</b> <b>switch</b> on their [...] "butler-mode".|$|R
5000|$|This {{confusion}} is also {{mentioned in the}} French movie La Cité de la peur. In the Disney's Toontown Online event [...] "April Toons Week," [...] <b>characters</b> <b>switch</b> playgrounds and everything is silly. Pluto switches places with Minnie Mouse, and he speaks. A brief gag in an episode of House of Mouse also acknowledges this — Hades asks Goofy, [...] "Are you a man, are you a dog, are you a man-dog[...] [...] what are you?". Goofy simply replies [...] "I'm just Goofy." ...|$|R
50|$|Since Dead or Alive 2, {{the series}} has {{implemented}} its tag team fighting system, allowing <b>characters</b> to <b>switch</b> {{back and forth}} for combo attacks and even attack simultaneously when timed correctly. The tag mode also included special throws unique to certain pairs of characters and allows for the participation of four players, something not common in the genre. Dead or Alive 3 introduced Attack Change, a new tag system feature where the fighting <b>character</b> can <b>switch</b> places with a partner that can attack while jumping in.|$|R
50|$|In Wu dialects, the {{morphology}} of {{the words}} are similar, but the <b>characters</b> are <b>switched</b> around. Not all Wu Chinese words exhibit this phenomenon, only some words in some dialects.|$|R
5000|$|Fishmen (Gyojin), often {{incorrectly}} {{referred to}} as Mermen, are a race who appear throughout the entire anime/manga series of One Piece on a regular basis. They look like humans with fish features and are obviously inspired by the ningyo. Fishman is written like ningyo but with the <b>characters</b> <b>switched</b> (人魚, Ningyo -> 魚人, Gyojin). Merfolk (Ningyo) appear in the series too. These are more peaceful of nature than the Fishmen and, like the mermaids and mermen of folklore, their upper half {{is that of a}} human while the lower half is that of a fish, though male Merfolk are somewhat uncommon.|$|R
50|$|The main {{gameplay}} {{feature is}} the ability of player <b>characters</b> to <b>switch</b> back and forth from an animal form into a human form at will. Different forms, Clans and Jobs have different abilities.|$|R
5|$|Combat in {{the game}} is similar to its predecessor, with the main series of {{missions}} beginning after an opening tutorial. The game features ground-based hack-and-slash gameplay and aerial combat. In ground combat, the player controls multiple <b>characters,</b> <b>switching</b> between them via the pause menu {{in order to use}} their different weapons. The characters use physical attacks using character weapons for short-range battle, while magical attacks are used for long-range attacks and groups of enemies. The magical attacks vary between the playable characters. Weapons, characters and magical abilities leave up and grow stronger as the player gains experience points in combat: weapons have a four-level cap.|$|R
500|$|Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann {{considered}} the heist missions a welcome deviation from series typical mission structure. Eurogamer Bramwell likened them to [...] "blockbuster set-pieces" [...] and GameSpot's Carolyn Petit cited the 1995 film Heat as a stylistic {{influence on their}} design. Joystiq's Xav de Matos felt creativity and methodical approaches were encouraged. Polygons Chris Plante likened rapid <b>character</b> <b>switching</b> during heist missions to [...] "film editing, with the player serving as editor, switching rapidly to the most interesting perspective for any moment". Computer and Video Games Andy Kelly felt that overall mission design was more diverse than and lacked the escort errands of its predecessors.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the conversations}} {{appearing}} in the early parts of the book, many of the <b>characters</b> <b>switch</b> {{back and forth between}} German and French, and are seen to be effectively bilingual. The French appears in the original within Mann's German text, similar to the practice of Tolstoy in [...] "War and Peace". The bilingual characters are of the older generation, who were already adults during the Napoleonic Wars; in later parts of the book, with the focus shifting to the family's younger generation against the background of Germany moving towards unification and assertion of its new role as a major European power, the use of French by the characters visibly diminishes.|$|R
500|$|Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is a -based {{fighting}} game {{in which}} players control characters with different attacks and fighting styles, and engage in combat to deplete their opponent's life gauge. The gameplay {{is set in a}} 2.5D environment where the characters are rendered in three-dimensional graphics, but their movements are restricted to a two dimensional plane; they may only move left and right, and upward through the air. Each player may select a team of two <b>characters</b> and can <b>switch</b> between them during combat. Alternatively, players may select one of two [...] "giant" [...] characters, who cannot be played as part of a team. When <b>characters</b> <b>switch,</b> the incoming one performs a special attack upon entry, and the previous one can regenerate health. Characters not in play may be used to assist, and to perform powerful team moves. A match ends when a team has no characters left, or when the timer reaches zero—in which case, the team with the most remaining life wins.|$|R
5|$|Final Fantasy X-2 reintroduces the series' classic {{character}} class system (seen previously in Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy Tactics) through {{the inclusion of}} dresspheres. Because the party never grows beyond three <b>characters,</b> <b>switching</b> <b>characters</b> during battle is unnecessary. Instead, the player can <b>switch</b> <b>character</b> classes, providing access to different abilities. The playable characters are allowed to equip one dressphere at a time, each providing different battle functions and abilities. Characters can learn new skills for each dressphere {{with the use of}} Ability Points (AP). AP is obtained by defeating enemies and by the use of items and abilities for that sphere. Abilities to be learned are chosen in the main menu. During battle, AP is given to that ability until it is learned. Each character can access as many as six dresspheres at a time, depending on the specific properties of the Garment Grid they are wearing. The Garment Grid is a placard featuring a geometric shape connected by nodes. These nodes are slots that can be filled with dresspheres, allowing characters to change {{character class}}es during their turn in battle. Most Garment Grids possess Gates that when passed through grant the user a complimentary buff.|$|R
50|$|Bon Cop, Bad Cop {{claimed to}} be Canada's first bilingual feature film, {{although}} that accomplishment in fact belongs to Amanita Pestilens (1963). Since the film revolves around the concept of mixed cultures and languages, most scenes include a mixture of French and English dialogue, with <b>characters</b> <b>switching</b> language rapidly. The entire movie was filmed using both a French and an English script, and the language used at each moment was finalized only later, during editing. The film was then released in two official versions, one for Anglophones and one for Francophones, which differ only in their subtitles {{and in a few}} spoken lines. The DVD also includes an option for bilingual viewers to switch off all subtitles.|$|R
