5|$|The archdiocese offers {{religious}} education classes {{in all of}} its 111 parishes for children who attend public and other non-religious schools. According to the 2007 Official Catholic Directory, there were 95,837 students enrolled in these classes. This same source lists as teachers 2760 laity, 58 religious sisters, and 43 priests and religious brothers. Religious education classes are also offered to adults throughout the archdiocese. In 1997, Archbishop Favalora adopted a policy requiring all volunteers, employees, teachers and priests to be fingerprinted and have a background check before they <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> children. Several years later, this policy was enshrined and adopted by all U.S. Bishops in the Charter for Protection of Young People.|$|E
5|$|Banks and Rutherford {{suggested}} the band take an extended hiatus, hoping Collins would save his marriage {{and that the}} band <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> him in Vancouver. Banks recorded a solo album A Curious Feeling in Polar Studios, Stockholm with Genesis touring drummer Chester Thompson and singer Kim Beacon, while Rutherford also recorded his first solo album, Smallcreep's Day, at the same studio. In April 1979, Collins returned to the UK after the attempt to salvage his marriage failed. With time to spare before working on the next Genesis album, he gigged with Brand X, and began work on demo tracks for what became his first solo album Face Value {{at his home in}} Shalford, Surrey. As well as playing piano and synthesizers, he had recently picked up a Roland drum machine and become interested in the possibilities of electronic drums.|$|E

25|$|Because Amoco {{would soon}} begin to receive its {{considerable}} liquids from Swan Hills in kind, {{the need to}} find ways to get optimum value from these liquids was clear. Markets in western Canada could not absorb the large and growing liquids volumes that Alberta was producing. However, markets in central Canada and the US Midwest <b>could.</b> <b>Working</b> <b>with</b> Chicago, Amoco Canada began developing a marketing strategy, a critical part of which would be the delivery system.|$|R
5|$|In 1905, Albert Einstein {{published}} his paper On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies about special relativity. Born was intrigued, and began researching the subject. He was devastated {{to discover that}} Minkowski was also researching special relativity along the same lines, but when he wrote to Minkowski about his results, Minkowski asked {{him to return to}} Göttingen and do his habilitation there. Born accepted. Toeplitz helped Born brush up on his matrix algebra so he <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> the four-dimensional Minkowski space matrices used in the latter's project to reconcile relativity with electrodynamics. Born and Minkowski got along well, and their work made good progress, but Minkowski died suddenly of appendicitis on 12 January 1909. The mathematics students had Born speak on their behalf at the funeral.|$|E
5|$|Scottish Protestantism {{was focused}} on the Bible, which was seen as infallible and the major source of moral authority. Many Bibles were large, {{illustrated}} and highly valuable objects. In {{the early part of the}} century the Genevan translation was commonly used. In 1611 the Kirk adopted the Authorised King James Version and the first Scots version was printed in Scotland in 1633, but the Geneva Bible continued to be employed into the seventeenth century. Bibles often became the subject of superstitions, being used in divination. Family worship was strongly encouraged by the Covenanters. Books of devotion were distributed to encourage the practice and ministers were encouraged to investigate whether this was being carried out. The seventeenth century marked the high-water mark of kirk discipline. Kirk sessions were able to apply religious sanctions, such as excommunication and denial of baptism, to enforce godly behaviour and obedience. In more difficult cases of immoral behaviour they <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> the local magistrate, in a system modelled on that employed in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|Following its losses, the 66th Division {{was reduced}} to cadre early in May; which meant that {{infantry}} battalions were cut to ten officers and about 45 men, the surplus being sent to base depots; the artillery, engineer and machine-gun units were distributed among other formations. The divisional artillery was attached to XIX Corps during the Battle of the Avre on 4 April and with XI Corps at the Battle of the Lys later in the month. During the summer, Bethell continued planning for the rebuilding of the division, having recruited a staff he felt he <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>with,</b> expecting that experienced men would become available as drafts returned from the Mediterranean. Overseas divisions there had suffered fewer casualties and the reduction from four to three battalions per brigade meant {{that large numbers of}} men would be returning. While reinforcements were assembled, the divisional cadres of the 66th Division and the 39th Division were used to train five American divisions in the British zone. The training process was complicated by a rigid schedule laid down by the American high command, who strongly objected to any deviation from their plans. In July, the American divisions moved up to the front and British troops began to arrive from Salonika and Palestine, though the assembly of the division was delayed by the returning men being given home leave and having to spend time acclimatising.|$|E
50|$|The name number (nafnnúmer) was {{the second}} {{national}} identification number in Iceland. It {{was based on the}} individual's name and thus allowed alphabetical ordering since computers at the time <b>could</b> not <b>work</b> <b>with</b> the alphabet directly.|$|R

50|$|When I {{came on the}} department, {{there were}} {{literally}} two assignments for black officers.

25|$|The {{theory of}} process {{oriented}} psychology centres around {{the idea of}} 'process': a meaningful, connected pattern over time that can be observed and tracked through non-intentional signals (e.g. non-verbal communication, body symptoms, dreams, accidents, conflicts). It is claimed that becoming consciously aware of the 'dreaming process' may help to deal with disturbances including mental and physical distress, relationship troubles and social issues. The theory of a 'dreaming process' began with Arnold Mindell's concept of the 'dreambody', developed from Jungian dream analysis and the observation that dreams and body symptoms were meaningfully connected. Mindell asserted that a therapist <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> body experiences to reveal the unconscious just as they <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> dreams.|$|E
25|$|Based on polls {{commissioned}} by the Māori news show Marae, the Māori Party appeared likely to win most of the Māori seats and stood a chance of holding the balance of power.

On 28 September, National announced a commitment to abolish the Māori seats in time for the 2014 election.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{a measure}} of Smith's {{creative}} range that he <b>could</b> <b>work</b> simultaneously <b>with</b> the decidedly dissimilar Run-D.M.C. and Whodini.

25|$|In 1949, {{with their}} {{finances}} improving, Vaughan and Treadwell purchased a three-story house on 21 Avon Avenue in Newark, occupying {{the top floor}} during their increasingly rare off-hours at home and relocating Vaughan's parents to the lower two floors. However, business pressures and personality conflicts led to a cooling in Treadwell and Vaughan's relationship. Treadwell hired a road manager to handle Vaughan's touring needs, and opened a management office in Manhattan so he <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> clients in addition to Vaughan.|$|E
25|$|European railway {{air brakes}} include the Kunze-Knorr brake (invented by Georg Knorr and {{manufactured}} by Knorr-Bremse) and the Oerlikon. The working principle {{is the same}} as for the Westinghouse air brake. In the steam era, Britain's railways were divided– some using vacuum brakes and some using air brakes– but there was a gradual standardization on the vacuum brake. Some locomotives, e.g. on the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, were dual-fitted so that they <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> either vacuum- or air-braked trains. In the diesel era, the process was reversed and British Railways switched from vacuum-braked to air-braked rolling stock in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Heffer's vote in Shadow Cabinet {{elections}} rose in 1971 when he {{tied with}} Castle in 15th place. While Heffer <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> Barbara Castle, she was {{moved in a}} reshuffle in 1972 and replaced by Reg Prentice who was already beginning the move {{across the political spectrum}} which would see him join the Conservative Party in 1977. Prentice's refusal to pledge support to five dockers imprisoned under the Industrial Relations Act appalled Heffer who considered resignation. When in February 1973 it became clear that Prentice had more leadership support, Heffer resigned (refusing an offer of another post). He remained interested in the topic and promoted a Private Member's Bill to abolish the 'Lump' (sub-contracting of labour in the building industry).|$|E

25|$|In 2012, AMD's then CEO Rory Read began {{a program}} to offer semi-custom designs. Rather than AMD simply {{designing}} and offering a single product, potential customers <b>could</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> AMD to design a custom chip based on AMD's intellectual property. Customers pay a non-recurring engineering fee for design and development, and a purchase price for the resulting semi-custom products. In particular, AMD noted their unique position of offering both x86 and graphics intellectual property. These semi-custom designs would have design wins as the APUs in the Playstation 4 and Xbox One and the subsequent PlayStation 4 Pro, Xbox One S, and Xbox One X. Financially, these semi-custom products would represent {{a majority of the}} company's revenue in 2016. In November 2017, AMD and Intel announced that Intel would market a product, combining in a single package an Intel Core CPU, a semi-custom AMD Radeon GPU, and HBM2 memory.|$|E
