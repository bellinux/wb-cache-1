50|$|On 2 April 2015, Pascal Houzelot, {{owner of}} the channel {{announced}} he was negotiating sale of the channel now estimated at 88.3 million euros to NextRadioTV that already owned BFM TV and RMC Découverte both on TNT as well as BFM Business. Controversy arose about the sale as being a contradiction of the stated objectives in the allocation of transmission authorization given by the Conseil supérieur de laudiovisuel (CSA), the authority entrusted with distribution of French broadcast channels. Also opposing the deal that would consolidate substantial broadcasting rights in one corporation were made by managements of TF1, M6 and Canal+ amongst many. Olivier Schrameck, president of CSA, described the sale deal as shocking and troubling. In July 2015, a partnership of Alain Weill and Altice bought shares of NextRadioTV. On 9 December 2015, CSA announced it was referring the matter to the <b>Conseil</b> <b>dÉtat</b> alleging fraud by the original owners of Numéro 23 in acquiring the licence under false pretexts. It also announced its revocation of the broadcasting license to Numéro 23 on TNT effective 30 June 2016.|$|E

However, after protests, data related to citizenship, language, and culture of origin were removed in October 2007. The <b>Conseil</b> <b>dÉtat,</b> the highest administrative jurisdiction, held in two decisions of 19 July 2010 that the [...] "Base-élèves" [...] and the computerised file of student identifiers ("Base nationale des identifiants des élèves" [...] or BNIE) were not functioning in compliance with the Data Protection Act. Further, the Conseil déetat considered that the collection of health data in the [...] "Base-élèves" [...] relating to children was not relevant and reminded in its decisions that parents have a right to object to the collection and processing of their childrens data. It also held that the retention period of 35 years for the children identifiers contained in the BNIE was excessive.|$|E

40|$|The French egalitarian law of bequests is {{a social}} device for distributing wealth from one {{generation}} to the other. The law of bequest is the result of a political debate within the <b>Conseil</b> <b>d?État</b> in which political considerations (the new democratic social state) are of considerable importance. However, the law of bequests takes into account the affective (within the family) and the economic dimensions. Grounded on historical material related to the 19 th Century, this paper examines what are these political, affective and economical dimensions and how they are inter related in the French context.
