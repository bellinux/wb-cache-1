5|$|When Jocelin died, he {{was back}} at Melrose Abbey, where his career had begun. He may have retired to Melrose knowing his death was near. Jocelin <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> die at Melrose, passing away on St Patrick's Day (17 March) 1199. He {{was buried in the}} monks' choir of Melrose Abbey Church. Hugh de Roxburgh, Chancellor of Scotland, was elected as Jocelin's replacement. The Chronicle of Melrose has only a short obituary.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus {{is silent}} about archers on the Alamanni side. The Germans almost <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not have mounted archers, {{as this was}} an arm that evolved in the East and in any case, their longbows are {{unsuitable}} for use on horseback. As for the infantry, the archery capability of the Rhine Germans has traditionally been seen as negligible, due to the 6th-century writer Agathias's comment that the Franks {{did not know how}} to use bows. But this is contradicted by the archaeological record and by Ammianus himself in other parts of his account. It is virtually certain that there were a significant number of Alamanni foot archers at Strasbourg.|$|E
5|$|Polygamy {{caused a}} breach between Smith {{and his first}} wife, Emma. Although Emma knew of some of her husband's marriages, she almost <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not know {{the extent of his}} {{polygamous}} activities. In 1843, Emma temporarily accepted Smith's marriage to four women boarded in the Smith household, but soon regretted her decision and demanded the other wives leave. In July 1843, Smith dictated a revelation directing Emma to accept plural marriage, but the two were not reconciled until September 1843, after Emma began participating in temple ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|The First Test at Brisbane was {{dominated}} by Australia, a pattern {{that was to be}} a feature of the series, although Barnes contributed only 31 to the total of 645 which brought an innings victory. Barnes displayed his liking for slightly aggressive practical jokes in this match: during a break for a particularly ferocious thunderstorm, he got a huge block of ice out of the tub in which our drinks were kept, staggered {{to the side of the}} dressing-room and tossed it on to the roof over the English dressing-room. It caused a noise for a start that brought all the Englishmen running and then it came over the side of the gutter, crashed on to the lawn and slithered down the grass. Those English eyes <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> stand out.|$|E
5|$|The stele almost <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not {{originate}} {{in the town of}} Rashid (Rosetta) where it was found, but more likely came from a temple site farther inland, possibly the royal town of Sais. The temple from which it originally came was probably closed around AD 392 when Eastern Roman emperor Theodosius I ordered the closing of all non-Christian temples of worship. The original stele broke at some point, its largest piece becoming what we now know as the Rosetta Stone. Ancient Egyptian temples were later used as quarries for new construction, and the Rosetta Stone probably was re-used in this manner. Later it was incorporated in the foundations of a fortress constructed by the Mameluke Sultan Qaitbay (c. 1416/18–1496) to defend the Bolbitine branch of the Nile at Rashid. There it lay for at least another three centuries until its rediscovery.|$|E
5|$|Whether Ragnall or Rǫgnvaldr, William's act {{of using}} a {{grandson}} of Óláfr in Caithness {{may have been an}} example of the king playing one member of the jarlsaetten against another. The jarlsaetten were people who possessed a claim to an earldom, in accordance with Norse custom, by right of their descent from previous earls. There are earlier instances of such claimants requesting Scottish kings for what they considered their birthright, and William <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> this when he granted Caithness to Haraldr Eiríksson, a grandson of Rǫgnvaldr Kali Kolsson, Earl of Orkney. If Ragnall was indeed a descendant of Ingibjǫrg, a daughter of Páll Hákonarson, Earl of Orkney (died 1137), he was directly descended from previous Scandinavian earls. Whereas Óláfr's marriage to Ingibjǫrg may have meant that Rǫgnvaldr was regarded {{as a member of the}} jarlsaetten as well, and a cousin to Haraldr himself.|$|E

25|$|Sindarin was {{designed}} with a Welsh-like phonology. It has {{most of the}} same sounds and a similar sound structure, or phonotactics.

25|$|There can be {{no doubt}} the NSW men are {{improving}} a good deal... They cannot be blamed for the farce, for it was nothing else. If the Australian team depends on Queenslanders to strengthen it, one is afraid it will be found wanting. They are quite the weakest lot of footballers I have even seen come down from Queensland. The play needs no detailed description as it was simply a practice match for NSW, and <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not advantageously advertise the new game.|$|E

25|$|The recent anti-Latin resentment in the Empire {{led to the}} Crusader states {{losing their}} {{protection}} from Byzantium. However, whilst the Crusader states should not and did not rely on Byzantium for protection, the Byzantines <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> in that it kept the aggressive expansionism of Islam in check. This could not {{be further from the}} truth in regards to the Principality of Antioch. With the fall of Jerusalem in 1187 to Saladin it was Western Europe that immediately posed a threat to the Empire. A new Crusade was declared by the recently elected Pope Gregory VIII.|$|E
25|$|These {{positions}} were ideal for funding a university education. Andrew was incorporated at the University of Glasgow in 1456, {{and he is}} found as a determinant, i.e. having completed his Bachelor's Degree, at the University of St Andrews in 1462 x 1463. He appears to have entered the University of Paris ad eundem in 1465. By 1460, he had become Dean of Moray, while retaining the Glasgow sub-deanery. In 1470, {{he may have been}} given the position of Provost of the Collegiate church of Lincluden, a position he <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> hold in 1477.|$|E
25|$|The events {{helped to}} {{discredit}} Bennett's Conservative government, {{and in the}} 1935 federal election, his party went from holding 134 seats to just 39. After the Trek, the Saskatchewan government provided free transportation as a peace sign back to the west. The camps were soon dismantled and replaced by seasonal relief camps run by the provinces, and that paid the men slightly more for their labor than the earlier camps. Although the Trek did not reach Ottawa, its reverberations <b>certainly</b> <b>did.</b> Several demands of the Trekkers were eventually met, and the public support that galvanized behind the Trek {{set the tone for}} the social and welfare provisions of the postwar era.|$|E

25|$|St Chad's Well near Battle Bridge on {{the river}} Fleet in London was a celebrated {{medicinal}} well and had a new pump house built in 1832. It was destroyed by the Midland Railway company, and is remembered in the street name of St Chad's Place. There is no independent evidence of Chad's visiting the site, but it clearly is named after him, and he <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> travel in southern England. His association with wells seems ancient, and no doubt stems from the St Chad's Well at Lichfield, visited by pilgrims and probably the water supply of his monastery. This {{is the most likely}} explanation of the name.|$|E
25|$|The 1966 model's frontal {{appearance}} was mildly altered with an eggcrate grille insert {{to replace the}} previous horizontal bars, and the coupe lost its roof-mounted extractor vents, which had proven inefficient. Corvettes also received an emblem {{in the corner of}} the hood for 1966. Head rests were a new option, one of the rarest options was the Red/Red Automatic option with power windows and air conditioning from factory which records show production numbered only 7 convertibles and 33 coupes. This relative lack of change reflected plans to bring out an all-new Corvette for 1967. It <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not reflect a fall-off in the car's popularity, however. In fact, 1966 would prove another record-busting year, with volume rising to 27,720 units, up some 4,200 over 1965s sales.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the years}} this became almost a {{mandatory}} exercise {{and although it}} may seem to many to be a gross act of indecency, it was generally well received by the sometimes up to hundreds of tourists and locals. The Kai Tais or Beanie Boys, as the trans women were referred to by Anglophone white visitors, <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not mind either. By the mid-70s Singapore started a crackdown on this type of lewd behaviour and sailors were arrested at gunpoint by the local authorities for upholding the tradition. By this time those sailors brave enough to try it were dealt with severely and even shipped home in disgrace. Though many locals accepted this part of Singaporean culture, many conservative Singaporeans {{felt that it was}} a disgrace and it defaced Singapore's image.|$|E
