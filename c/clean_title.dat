50|$|In 2010 city {{officials}} in Chicago investigated claims {{that some of}} the taxis in the city had been previously categorized as salvage vehicles (typically an insurance designation meaning the vehicles were damaged enough that it would cost more to fix the vehicle than the intrinsic worth of vehicle). Chicago law prohibits operating any vehicle as a taxi that was once deemed a salvage title. Chicago investigators found over 340 vehicles, of which 183 vehicles belonged to Garber's Chicago Carriage Cab Company. Garber had bought salvaged police cars, <b>cleaned</b> the <b>titles</b> of the salvage designation, and then illegally added the vehicles to his fleet. City officials fined Garber and his business associates up to $50,000 per vehicle for a total of $9 million. Garber's 183 salvage vehicles represented approximately 20% of his entire fleet. The prosecutors also estimated that many of the cars had been in service for up to 4 years prior to the investigation. Additionally, the Chicago Sun-Times newspaper investigated 100 of Garber's taxis from other fleets not associated with Chicago and found that 23 had previously been designated as salvage titles. The newspaper stated that it was unknown whether those vehicles were still in circulation. More details of the salvage scheme (and further implication of Garber's involvement) became available through the 2014 trial of one of Garber's business partners, Alexsandr Igolnikov, who was convicted of conspiracy as well as interstate transportation and possession of false automobile titles. Igolnikov was responsible for purchasing the salvage vehicles, repairing them, and then working through corrupt auto brokers to obtain <b>clean</b> <b>titles</b> from Indiana or Illinois. Once the new titles were secured, the salvaged vehicles were painted maroon and entered into Garber's taxi fleet as well as other fleets co-owned by Garber and Igolnikov. Igolnikov would repair and paint the vehicles in a garage owned by Garber.|$|R

50|$|In North America, a salvage {{title is}} a form of vehicle title branding, which notes that the vehicle has been damaged and/or deemed a total loss by an {{insurance}} company that paid a claim on it. The criteria for determining when a salvage title is issued differ considerably by each state, province or territory. In a minority of states and Canadian provinces, regulations require a salvage title for stolen or vandalized vehicles which are not recovered by police within 21 days. In such cases insurance companies declare a vehicle total loss and pay off the previous owner; but, in others, it is issued only for losses due to damage. Under some circumstances, a salvage title denotation may be removed or replaced with a Rebuilt Salvage designation; and cars imported to, or exported from, the United States may be issued a <b>clean</b> <b>title</b> regardless of history.|$|E
25|$|The New York City guide Preventing Rats on Your Property {{discusses}} how the NYC Health Department, {{through its}} Pest Control Services program, inspects {{private and public}} properties for rats. Property owners that fail an inspection receive a Health Department Commissioner's Order and have five days to correct the problem. If after five days the property fails a second inspection, the owner receives a Notice of Violation and can be fined. If the Health Department feels it must itself exterminate or clean up the property, the property owner is billed (about $1,000 a day in 2004). Unpaid charges become a priority lien against the building, preventing property owners from selling with a <b>clean</b> legal <b>title.</b> Failure to comply with an order of the Commissioner is a misdemeanor, and subjects the landlord to criminal prosecution, a fine and/or imprisonment, as well as additional civil penalties. The penalty for each rodent violation was as high as $2,000 in 2004.|$|R

One power plant in New England (Merrimack) was in Phase I. Four other plants (Newington, Mount Tom, Brayton Point, and Salem Harbor) were added under other provisions of the program.

40|$|With the {{exception}} of anecdotal information which suggests that auctioned or foreclosed properties in Malaysia tend to be sold at a deep discount, no study has thus far attempted to quantify this foreclosure discount. This notion is explored by comparing the listing price of auctioned apartments with comparable non-auctioned apartments located within the same building blocks in Kuala Lumpur during the period 2009 - 2014. The property auction market is predominately relied upon to dispose of foreclosed properties in Malaysia. It is found that foreclosed apartments are listed at a discount of 33. 4 % as compared to apartments advertised in the private negotiated market. This discount is attributed to “stigma effect” associated with auctioned properties and the imperfections of the Malaysian auction market such as auctioned properties may not carry a <b>clean</b> <b>title,</b> potential buyers cannot view the properties prior to auction and may not obtain vacant possession of the properties. The “proxy effect” was minimal since the matching strategy adopted would have netted out the differentials in locational and neighbourhood characteristics between auctioned and non-auctioned properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{dominant}} {{strain of}} law and development theory holds that strong property rights are {{a necessary condition for}} economic growth. Nonetheless, China has experienced thirty years of frenetic growth absent strong property rights. This Note explores this phenomenon through an analysis of a unique corporate form that has come to underlie most of the publicly traded Chinese Internet sector—the Variable Interest Entity (VIE). The VIE is, at its core, a series of contracts designed to mimic “true” ownership. As such, the VIE problematizes law and development theory in two primary ways. First, the contract-based ownership system does not provide the <b>clean</b> <b>title</b> envisioned by most law and development theorists, and consequently raises issues related to control. Second, the ownership claim of the investor is likely judicially unenforceable. Accordingly, the increasing prevalence of the VIE structure and the simultaneous economic growth enjoyed by China’s Internet sector naturally leads to a number of interrelated conclusions. First, the VIE shows that weak property rights may be sufficient in situations where they nonetheless provide notice of who “owns” the particular item at issue (i. e., it serves a title-clearing function). Second, culturally specific, extralegal institutions and methods may vindicate rights {{in the absence of the}} rule of law. Third, predictability, an implicit purpose of the property rights regime, may allow for economic growth absent strong property rights. Read together, these three conclusions suggest that the academy has taken a good idea—the almost universal emphasis of rule {{of law and}} property rights—and stretched it beyond the confines of its natural universe...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} technological diffusion of scrubbers, a sulfur dioxide (SO 2) abatement technology, {{in response to}} Title IV of the <b>Clean</b> Air Act. <b>Title</b> IV implemented a tradable pollution permit system for SO 2, which is radically different from the state emission rate standards that were in place previously. I find that power plants with strict state regulations (or command-and-control regulations) and low expected scrubber installation costs have a high probability of installing a scrubber. These findings suggest that, although Title IV has encouraged diffusion, some scrubbers have been installed because of state regulatory pressure. Since policies are often evaluated based on the incentives they provide to promote adoption of new technologies, {{it is important that}} policy makers understand the relationship between technological diffusion and regulatory structure to make informed decisions. Although tradable permit systems are thought to give firms more flexibility in choosing abatement technologies, I show that interactions between a permit system and pre-existing command-and-control regulations can limit that flexibility. technology diffusion, environmental regulation, electric generating industry...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Internet was {{designed}} {{in a totally}} different context than the one existing today. New applications have brought {{a new set of}} requirements which were not properly resolved due to architectural limitations. Therefore, the Internet archi-tecture must be reviewed in a clean slate approach. In this context, Entity Title Model represents a revolutionary way to semantically understand the entities, observing their needs and capabilities in order to better serve them, through a new flexible architecture with several innovations, especially in addressing and routing aspects. This paper presents a protocol capable of providing efficient multicast at the network layer, based on ETArch over OpenFlow. Multicast is an important requirement for applications involving the transmission of multimedia content, real-time communication and data-sharing services. We describe some experiments and present a comparison between a video application, first implemented using TCP/IP with unicast and multicast services, and then using ETArch focusing on multicast traffic aggregation. The results showed that the bandwidth consumption using our architecture remains constant just as the traditional one; however, our approach uses slightly less bandwidth, provides better strategies for the control plane, improves the group addressability, and facilitates its deployment based on the broad support to Openflow by leading equipment suppliers.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{indication}} that the {{pulp and paper industry}} will be required to comply with <b>Clean</b> Air Act (<b>Title</b> V) requirements to estimate emissions of bulk bases and HAPs from landfills. One method of such estimation is through the use of the Landfill Air Emissions Estimation Model (LAEEM), which was developed and calibrated specifically for municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. The industry is concerned with the applicability of LAEEM because the nature of the materials placed in industry landfills is considered to be so different from those in MSW landfills, that emissions will likely be lower than model predictions. This study examined the basis of LAEEM and its calibration, and explored alternative predictive approaches. It was concluded that LAEEM, when defined in terms of the default AP- 42 factors, does not accurately represent uncontrolled methane and HAP emissions from industry landfills. It does not account for the attenuating effects of biodegradation and absorption, nor does it account for the potentially slower migration of landfill gas through a fully saturated landfill zone or the oxidation of methane migrating through landfill covers. With adjusted calibration factors that are based upon field observations, LAEEM may provide more realistic estimates of methane and HAP emissions from industry landfills...|$|R
40|$|Assessments {{are made}} of the {{benefits}} of the 1990 <b>Clean</b> Air Act <b>Title</b> IV (COVE), Phase 2, SO 2 and NOX reduction provisions, to the visibility in typical eastern and western Class 1 areas. Probable bands of visibility impairment distribution curves are developed for Shenandoah National Park, Smoky Mountain National Park and the Grand Canyon National Park, based on the existing emissions, ``Base Case``, and for the COVE emission reductions, ``CAAA Case``. Emission projections for 2010 are developed with improved versions of the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program emission projection models. Source-receptor transfer matrices created with the Advanced Statistical Trajectory Regional Air Pollution (ASTRAP) model are used with existing emission inventories and with the emission projections to calculate atmospheric concentrations of sulfate and nitrate at the receptors of interest for existing and projected emission scenarios. The Visibility Assessment Scoping Model (VASM) is then used to develop distributions of visibility impairment. VASM combines statistics of observed concentrations of particulate species and relative humidity with ASTRAP calculations of the relative changes in atmospheric sulfate and nitrate particulate concentrations in a Monte Carlo approach to produce expected distributions of hourly particulate concentrations and RH. Light extinction relationships developed in theoretical and field studies are then used to calculate the resulting distribution of visibility impairment. Successive Monte Carlo studies are carried out to develop sets of visibility impairment distributions with and without the COVE emission reductions to gain insight into the detectability of expected visibility improvements...|$|R

40|$|Increasing energy {{security}} and lowering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been prominent goals in recent {{energy and environmental}} policies. While these goals are often complementary, {{there may also be}} cases where they conflict. A case in point is the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). The goals of EISA are to increase the United States' energy independence and security as well as to increase the production of <b>clean</b> renewable fuels. <b>Title</b> II of EISA establishes mandates for increasing the use of low carbon fuels to replace gasoline. While the Title II mandates will meet the {{energy security}} goal of EISA, the mandate for the use of at least 16 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol by 2022 may conflict with efforts to reduce substantially the nation's GHG emissions over the next 20 years. The nation's production capacity for biomass is likely to be limited and the use of biomass to replace coal in generating electricity yields 2 to 3 times the GHG reduction associated with using cellulosic ethanol to displace gasoline. Thus, there is a trade-off between the energy security gains of the biofuels mandate under EISA and the more effective (in terms of GHG emission reductions) use of biomass in the electric utility sector. One means of evaluating this trade-off is to examine the factors that affect the costeffectiveness of diverting biomass from electricity production to cellulosic ethanol production. This paper identifies some of the key factors that affect the cost-effectiveness of the energy security and climate change goals of EISA. The cost-effectiveness of EISA will depend on (1) constraints on biomass production, that is, {{the extent to which the}} EISA mandate may crowd out the use of biomass to generate electricity; (2) the world oil price (and the cost of production of cellulosic ethanol); and (3) the social cost of carbon. energy security, cost-effective policy, cellulosic ethanol...|$|R
60|$|But {{to return}} to my {{anomalous}} position in King Arthur's kingdom. Here I was, a giant among pigmies, a man among children, a master intelligence among intellectual moles: by all rational measurement {{the one and only}} actually great man in that whole British world; and yet there and then, just as in the remote England of my birth-time, the sheep-witted earl who could claim long descent from a king's leman, acquired at second-hand from the slums of London, was a better man than I was. Such a personage was fawned upon in Arthur's realm and reverently looked up to by everybody, even though his dispositions were as mean as his intelligence, and his morals as base as his lineage. There were times when he could sit down in the king's presence, but I couldn't. I could have got a title easily enough, and that would have raised me a large step in everybody's eyes; even in the king's, the giver of it. But I didn't ask for it; and I declined it when it was offered. I couldn't have enjoyed such a thing with my notions; and it wouldn't have been fair, anyway, because as far back as I could go, our tribe had always been short of the bar sinister. I couldn't have felt really and satisfactorily fine and proud and set-up over any title except one that should come from the nation itself, the only legitimate source; and such an one I hoped to win; {{and in the course of}} years of honest and honorable endeavor, I did win it and did wear it with a high and <b>clean</b> pride. This <b>title</b> fell casually from the lips of a blacksmith, one day, in a village, was caught up as a happy thought and tossed from mouth to mouth with a laugh and an affirmative vote; in ten days it had swept the kingdom, and was become as familiar as the king's name. I was never known by any other designation afterward, whether in the nation's talk or in grave debate upon matters of state at the council-board of the sovereign. This title, translated into modern speech, would be THE BOSS. Elected by the nation. That suited me. And it was a pretty high title. There were very few THE'S, and I was one of them. If you spoke of the duke, or the earl, or the bishop, how could anybody tell which one you meant? But if you spoke of The King or The Queen or The Boss, it was different.|$|R
