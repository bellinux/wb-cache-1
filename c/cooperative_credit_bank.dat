The presence of credit guarantee schemes and the role of banking intermediaries as promoters reduce significantly the risk of default on these initiatives.

Bank loans, especially long-term bank loans, are often used by young and small firms in Germany. We focus on {{a specific type of}} loan. The assignment of these loans to firms involves <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks,</b> private <b>credit</b> <b>banks</b> or savings banks. The loans come from public subsidized loan programs and constitute a substantial part of all long-term bank loans to young firms and SME in Germany. We present empirical analyses for the 1990 s based on county-level as well as firm-level data. We find that private <b>credit</b> <b>banks</b> did not change their lending to young and small firms during that period. Since the start of the 1990 s, they have played only a minor role in start-up and small business lending. Cooperative and savings banks have had, in contrast, a strong, positive influence. One particularly relevant finding is that the lending activities of cooperative and savings banks turn out to be similarly strong and do not differ significantly. Taken together, our results imply that having banks that operate regionally with a decentralized organizational form, but not public ownership, is crucial to the observed lending activities. ...|$|R

The System obtains funds for loans from the na-tional money market by issuing system-wide consolidated bonds and discount notes. The interest cost on bonds and notes depends upon market interest rates which have been very volatile in recent years and are not controllable by the System [Bildersee]. In order to obtain sufficient funds, the System must be willing to offer investors competitive rates. Although cost control is imperative in all segments of the System's operations, it is especially important in the funds acquisition process since interest paid on System debt securities typically accounts for over 90 per...|$|R
