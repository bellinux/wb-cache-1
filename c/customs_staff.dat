This study employed Quantitative survey method by combining a set of International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and Barriers Questionnaire adopted from Australian Bureau of Statistics. The participants in this cross-sectional study were 225 middle-aged <b>Custom</b> <b>staff</b> age 35 to 55 years old and randomly selected.

50|$|A risk {{management}} system operates at the back end. The consignments selected by the system under green channel are cleared immediately after payment of duty and taxes. At present, almost 30-33% consignments are cleared under green channel. Remaining consignments are sent either to yellow channel (on line scrutiny of documents by assessing officer {{on the basis of}} declaration, without examination of the goods) or red channel where examination (or inspection) is conducted. As a result of this system examination has been reduced from 100% to around 40%. Moreover, presence of importer’s representative/ clearing agent is not required.

50|$|The {{paperless}} {{computer system}} has substantially curtailed processing period which has in turn reduced {{cost of doing}} business. This has not only simplified a number of procedures, but also brought transparency (less interaction with the <b>customs</b> <b>staff)</b> and certainly more revenues for the exchequer. Needless to mention that in the redundant system each bill of entry (goods declaration) for imports required 34 signatures & 62 verifications. Furthermore, multiple copies and numerous mandatory documents were required to be attached with the GD. All these documents were carried from desk to desk by the importer.

50|$|At {{the time}} that funding was being sought for the {{construction}} of a new Customs House in Rockhampton the economic situation in Queensland was worsening with the depression of the 1890s. The Queensland Colonial Architect, Alfred Barton Brady, estimated some £6000 was required to finance a massive repair program to reconstruct the Rockhampton Customs House, money that was unavailable. Temporary premises were sought for <b>Customs</b> <b>staff</b> for three years until repairs could be made. Brady was aware of the need for a new building but was also aware of the reduced spending of the Colonial Government to cover new projects as a result of the depression. Despite more alterations and repairs, major structural problems had reappeared by 1897. With accommodation in the Customs House untenable by this stage, tenders were called for the refitting of the Queen's Warehouse as a temporary Customs House.|$|E

Some were shown during pollination by insects, others diseased in various ways.|$|E

Milford's nephew R. Christopher Bradby went out in 1928. He returned to Britain just in time, for on 18 October 1931, the Japanese invaded Manchuria. Miss M.

Japan was a much less well-known market to OUP, and a small volume of trade was carried out largely through intermediaries.

50|$|In the Philippines, {{there is}} one {{shopping}} mall called the Duty Free Philippines Fiestamall, which is located {{a few miles away}} from Ninoy Aquino Airport as opposed to being at the airport itself. It is the only shopping mall {{of its kind in the}} world. The goods that are sold in this mall are often imported products which come from around the world (mainly from United States, Asia and Australasia) and are not found in any other shopping malls in the country, aside from duty-free malls. Tourists, visitors and returning citizens of Philippines often pay a visit to this mall shortly after their arrival (since only arriving passengers and their companions are allowed access). In order to gain entry, a passport is needed to be presented and registered at the Customer Registration Counter at the entrance of the mall. The customer will then be issued a shopping card; these shopping cards must be presented to the cashier for validation of purchases. Arriving customers are given a certain tax-free allowance on purchases and anything in excess will be subject to local and national taxes. In the past, the mall used to only accept US dollars and Philippine peso but in recent years, it had begun accepting other currencies such as Japanese yen, Brunei dollar, Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Saudi riyal, Bahraini dinar, and Thai baht. Currency exchange booths are also available inside the mall if a customer wishes to exchange currencies into Philippine pesos or US dollars. Credits cards can also be used for purchasing goods.In Australia, duty-free shops, once common, have all but disappeared since the introduction of GST in 2000. Retailer James Richardson operates several duty-free shops in major cities, but most duty-free shops are now located within international airports. Residents and tourists are allowed to purchase virtually any physical good within 60 days of departure, which needs to be taken on the outward flight, and claim the GST component back through the Tourist Refund Scheme when passing through customs. Consumers are now free to fully use their items prior to departure. This is in contrast prior to 2000, where all purchases had to be packed by the duty-free store in a sealed clear plastic bag, and could only be broken open by <b>customs</b> <b>staff</b> just prior to departure.|$|E

The system begins by using a new simulation system embedded within a heuristic search to determine minimum staffing levels for arrival and departure work areas. These staffing requirements are then used as the input to an integer programming model which optimally allocates full and part-time staff to each period of the working day. These shifts are then assigned to daily work schedules having a six-day-on, three-day-off structure. The application of these techniques has resulted in significantly lower staffing levels, {{while at the same}} time creating both high quality rosters and ensuring that all passenger processing targets are met.

Surveys {{of the availability of}} P. clarkii in five Brazilian regions were carried out to investigate whether the 2008 Brazilian imposed import ban for this species was effective. In order to address this issue, 81 aquarium stores were surveyed in years before (2007 - 2008) and after (2009 - 2011) the ban had been imposed. The results revealed that the availability of P. clarkii in aquarium stores decreased from pre-ban surveys in 2007 - 2008 to post-ban surveys in 2009 - 2011 (58. 0 % to 18. 5 %; χ 2 = 16. 52, d. f. = 1, P< 0. 05), but still persists within the country. These findings clearly demonstrate that Brazilian Federal Ordinance No. 5 of 2008 has not been effective and that the aquarium trade continues distributing red swamp crayfishes in spite of their import ban. This survey underscores the need to enhance the number of invertebrate experts in the Brazilian <b>Customs</b> Agency <b>staff</b> to monitor the aquarium trade, the inspection by IBAMA officials and environmental police aiming at confiscating P. clarkii, and the awareness of retailers and aquarium hobbyists, as well as electronic service pro-viders (i. e. e-commerce) ...|$|R
