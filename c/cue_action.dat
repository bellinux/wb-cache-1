40|$|Background. Transsexual has a {{high risk}} {{behavioral}} of STI and HIV/AIDS spreading because he does the sexual intercourse orally and through the anal which {{makes it easier for}} having the wound as the entry of the HIV virus, besides transsexual also has many sexual partners. One effective way to prevent the spreading is by using condom consistently. Objective. The objective of this research was to know the correlation between <b>cues</b> to <b>action</b> with the behavioral of using condom consistently in sexual intercourse of transsexuals in IWAMA in 2008. Methods. The research’s design was analysis­correlation with the approaching of cross sectional study. It use non random sampling method. The sample are 20 person transsexuals in IWAMA. The data collection was done through quantitative method by using questioners. The technique of the data analysis was Chi Square test. Results. Out of 14 transsexuals who got the <b>cues</b> to <b>action</b> from this research, 12 transsexuals usecondom consistently. From the Chi Square test, there is a significant correlation between <b>cues</b> to <b>action</b> with the behavioral of using condom consistently. Conclussions. <b>Cues</b> to <b>action</b> is correlated with the behavioral of using condom consistently by transsexuals. It means that the greater number and the more frequent <b>cues</b> to <b>action</b> is accepted by the transsexuals, the greater number of transsexuals use condom consistently in their sexual intercourse...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} ways in which animate objects can be used to <b>cue</b> <b>actions</b> as part of {{coaching}} in Activities of Daily Living (ADL). In this case, changing the appearance or behavior of a physical object is intended to <b>cue</b> <b>actions</b> which are appropriate for a given context. The context is defined by the intention of the users, the state of the objects and the tasks for which these objects can be used. We present initial design prototypes and simple user trials which explore the impact of different cues on activity. It is shown that raising the handle of a jug, for example, not only cues the act of picking up the jug but also encourages use of the hand adjacent to the handle; that combinations of lights (on the objects) and auditory cues influence activity through reducing uncertainty; and that cueing can challenge pre-learned action sequences. We interpret these results in terms of the idea that the animate objects can be used to create affording situations, and discuss implications of this work to support relearning of ADL following brain damage or injury, such as might arise following a stroke...|$|R

40|$|Research {{confirms}} that the body influences perception, but {{little is known about}} the embodiment of attention. We investigated whether the implied actions of others direct spatial attention, using a lateralized covert-orienting task with nonpredictive central cues depicting static, right/left-facing bodies poised in midaction. Validity effects (decreased response times for validly compared with invalidly cued trials) indicated orienting in the direction of the implied action. In Experiment 1, we compared action (running, throwing) with nonaction (standing) <b>cues.</b> Only the <b>action</b> <b>cues</b> produced validity effects, suggesting that implied action directs attention. The <b>action</b> <b>cues</b> produced faster responses overall, suggesting that <b>action</b> <b>cues</b> prime motor responses. In Experiment 2, we determined whether <b>action</b> <b>cues</b> shifted attention in a specific direction rather than to a general side of space: Two <b>cues</b> had similar <b>action</b> speed and motor effort but differed in implied direction (jumping, vertical; throwing, horizontal). Validity effects were found only for the throw cues for which the implied motion direction was consistent with lateralized target locations. In Experiment 3, we compared block-like stimuli to the throwing action stimuli to examine whether lower level perceptual information could account for the attention effects alone. Validity effects were found only for the human-action stimuli. Overall, the results suggest that predictive simulations of action shift attention in action-consistent directions...|$|R

50|$|The health belief model {{posits that}} a cue, or trigger, is {{necessary}} for prompting engagement in health-promoting behaviors. <b>Cues</b> to <b>action</b> can be internal or external.

Examples of <b>cues</b> to <b>action</b> include a reminder postcard from a dentist, the illness of a friend or family member, and product health warning labels. The intensity of cues needed to prompt action varies between individuals by perceived susceptibility, seriousness, benefits, and barriers. For example, individuals who believe they {{are at high risk}} for a serious illness and who have an established relationship with a primary care doctor may be easily persuaded to get screened for the illness after seeing a public service announcement, whereas individuals who believe they are at low risk for the same illness and also do not have reliable access to health care may require more intense external cues in order to get screened.|$|R

ConclusionRisk perceptions were the most important determinant of preventive behavioral intentions for hepatitis B among health personnel; thus, emphasizing risk perceptions is recommended in educational programs aimed at increasing health personnel's practices regarding hepatitis B...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{attention}} can {{be directed}} {{by the actions of}} others. We used ERPs method to investigate the neural underpins associated with attention orienting which is induced by implied body action. Participants performed a standard non-predictive cuing task, in which a directional implied action (throwing and running) or non-action (standing) cue was randomly presented and then followed by a target to the left or right of the central cue, despite cue direction. The cue-triggered ERPs results demonstrated that implied <b>action</b> <b>cues,</b> rather than the non-action cue, could shift the observers&# 39; spatial attention as demonstrated by the robust anterior directing attention negativity (ADAN) effects in throwing and running cues. Further, earlier N 1 (100 - 170 ms) and P 2 (170 - 260 ms) waveform differences occurred between implied <b>action</b> and non-action <b>cues</b> over posterior electrodes. The P 2 component might reflect implied motion signal perception of implied <b>action</b> <b>cues,</b> and this implied motion perception might {{play an important role in}} facilitating the attentional shifts induced by implied <b>action</b> <b>cues.</b> Target-triggered ERPs data (mainly P 3 a component) indicated that implied <b>action</b> <b>cues</b> (throwing and running) speeded and enhanced the responses to valid targets compared to invalid targets. Furthermore, P 3 a might imply that implied action orienting may share similar mechanisms of action with voluntary attention, especially at the novel stimuli processing decision-level. These results further support previous behavioral findings that implied body actions direct spatial attention and extend our understanding about the nature of the attentional shifts that are elicited by implied <b>action</b> <b>cues.</b> (C) 2016 Elsevier B.

40|$|Introducatn: Kidney {{stone is}} the most common chronic kidney {{condition}} after hypertension. kidney stone recurrence is common worldwide and it is estimated that almost 50 % of stone formers will have a recurrence within 10 years. Patients' knowledge on kidney stones and its recurrence prevention {{is an important factor in}} preventive behaviors of kidney stone recurrence. This study aimed to determinine the preventive behaviors of kidney stone recurrence on it and its relation to knowledge on it and also knowledge on it receiving resources. Methods: This descriptive- analytical study was performed as cross-sectional. The sample size consisted of 210 persons who had referred to 3 care centers in Yazd. Data Collection instrument was a questionnaire that had two parts: the first part was demographic information and the second part was scales for preventive behavior of kidney stones recurrence, knowledge aassessment and <b>cues</b> to <b>action</b> which were completed with interview. Data were analyzed with T-test, ANOVA, χ 2 and correlation coefficient test thnough spss 16. Results: Mean score of recurrence preventive behaviors was 38. 75 ± 7. 85 from 70 the Mean score on knowledge was 9. 49 ± 7. 85 from 25 and Mean score of <b>cues</b> to <b>action</b> was 2. 67 ± 1. 78 from 8. The lowest reported recurrence preventive behavior was consulting with a registered dietitian or specialist about consumption of fruits and vegetables. The lowest reported knowledge was about dairy consumption in individuals with a history of kidney stone (21. 4 %), and the highest reported <b>cues</b> to <b>action</b> was other kidney stone patients (54. 3 %). Pearson correlation showed a positive correlation between preventive behaviors, knowledge and <b>cues</b> to <b>action</b> (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Regarding the low rate of knowledge and performance of the subjects as well as the high age of patients suffering from kidney stones and lack of enough education in this group, health staff can be the most important source of knowledge for these people about preventive behaviors of kidney stones recurrence...|$|R
