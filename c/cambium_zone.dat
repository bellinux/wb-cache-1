40|$|Samples {{of needles}} {{from the middle}} part of the crown and cambial zone scrapings, which {{includes}} cambium cells and nonlignified xylem cells from five stems of 15 years old Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L. trees from green moss-forb groups stands on sod-podzolic soil in Krasnoyarsk forest steppe were investigated. Thermal stability of the antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase, catalase, glutathione reductase (GR); enzymes of carbohydrate and phenolic metabolism: amylase, invertase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) which are involved in providing the xylogenesis process; and markers of oxidative stress: peroxide hydrogen and malondialdehyde (MDA) were studied in the temperature interval 20 – 80 °C. It {{was found that the}} positive effect on the antioxidant enzymes activity mainly manifested up to 40 °C. As the temperature increases, antioxidant protection weakens. The mechanisms of oxidative stress in <b>cambium</b> <b>zone</b> and needles in condition of pyrogenic heat shock are distinguished due to different thermal stability of antioxidant enzymes in these tissues. The most sensitive to elevated temperatures was catalase both in <b>cambium</b> <b>zone</b> and needles. In the <b>cambium</b> <b>zone,</b> peroxidase and GR detect low resistance to high temperature, while SOD has a higher level of. In the needles on the contrary, peroxidase and GR exhibit high thermal stability, whereas SOD activity rapidly reduces at higher temperatures. Amylase, invertase and PAL exceed, according to the thermal stability of examined antioxidant enzymes, what allow quick restoration of carbohydrate and phenolic metabolism after pyrogenic heat shock to providing of xylogenesis process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Peroxidases {{are known}} to play {{important}} roles in plant wound healing. Biochemical analysis and histochemical localization techniques {{were used to assess}} changes and distribution of peroxidases in the recovering bark after girdling in Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. Between 4 and 21 days after girdling (DAG), peroxidases activity in the girdled trees significantly increased by 30 - 40 times over that in ungirdled trees. During the whole bark recovery process (from 0 to 63 DAG), the peroxidase signal was not found in the tissue regions subjected to intense cell division activity (regenerating cambial zone and phellogen). However, high peroxidase activity was detected in the callus, cortex-like, mature phloem and xylem. Interestingly, it was shown that, in maturing xylem and phloem cells, there was respectively an inward and outward peroxidase activity gradient {{on both sides of the}} <b>cambium</b> <b>zone.</b> An isoelectric-focusing electrophoresis of the extracted protein displayed two isozyme bands of peroxidase: PODand POD. PODwas only detected in the xylem fraction and could play a role in xylem differentiation. POD was only identified in the recovering bark portion and could be more engaged in bark regeneration process. A relationship between IAA and peroxidase is also discussed.

30|$|In {{response}} to biotic stress, conifers secrete an oleoresin that is composed mainly of mono- and diterpenes (Schmidt et al. [2010]). Oleoresin production {{may be associated}} with resin duct formation in the <b>cambium</b> <b>zone</b> and developing xylem in {{response to}} insect attack or experimentally following methyl jasmonate treatment (Zulak and Bohlmann [2010]). In this study, applications of > 1 mg of ethephon induced significant resin secretion although there were no clear differences in resin duct formation (Figure 4) over the duration of the experiment. The traumatic xylem that developed in stems treated with ethephon showed poorly lignified parenchymatous cells suffused with extractives (Figure 5). The lack of change in the size and number of the resin canals indicates that the effect of ethephon did not extend to the type of resin-duct formation that is associated with terpene synthesis over the time course of this experiment. By contrast, a similar treatment (1 % ethephon in lanolin) had been found previously to induce significant resinification as well as terpene-duct formation in P. halepensis (Yamamoto and Kozlowski [1987 a]). Traumatic resin-duct formation after ethephon injection has also been observed in four-year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and giant redwood trees (Sequoiadendron giganteum Lindl. Buchholz) (Hudgins and Franceschi [2004]). The higher levels of ethephon (5 and 25 mg) used in this study induced greater resin bleeding and bark splitting, and a reduction in stem girth and plant vitality leading to chlorosis.|$|E
30|$|The Type 1 resin pockets {{appeared}} {{to form in}} the fully differentiated mature wood behind the <b>cambium</b> and <b>zone</b> of differentiation.

30|$|The Type 1 resin pockets {{occurred}} in the inner part of the early wood, adjacent to the growth ring boundary.

30|$|The {{presence}} of Type 1 resin pockets {{in the early}} wood of trees subjected to the stem bending treatments applied here, suggests that Type 1 resin pockets were forming in the mature wood, behind the <b>cambium</b> and <b>zone</b> of differentiation, as observed by Donaldson (1983). The early wood that {{is close to the}} growth-ring boundary {{appears to have been a}} zone of weakness for the formation of Type 1 resin pockets, and will have contained fully differentiated mature wood at the time of the spring and summer stem bending treatments. The structural properties of the mature wood will not be affected by either the water status of the trees, or the timing of the stem bending during the growth season. This situation could explain the similar number of Type 1 resin pockets formed when the trees were water-stressed compared with trees that were water stressed then rehydrated.|$|R
40|$|Corresponding author) Defense-related terpenoid {{biosynthesis}} in conifers is {{a dynamic}} process closely associated with specialized anatomical structures that allows conifers to cope with attack from many potential pests and pathogens. The constitutive and inducible terpenoid de-fense of conifers involves several hundred different monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes. Changing arrays of these many compounds are formed from the general isoprenoid pathway by activities of large gene families for two classes of enzymes, the terpene synthases and the cytochrome P 450 -dependent monooxy-genases of the CYP 720 B group. Extensive studies have been con-ducted on the genomics, proteomics and molecular biochemical characterization of these enzymes. Many of the conifer terpene synthases are multi-product enzymes, and the P 450 enzymes of the CYP 720 B group are promiscuous in catalyzing multiple oxidations, along homologous series of diterpenoids, from {{a broad spectrum of}} substrates. The terpene synthases and CYP 720 B genes respond to authentic or simulated insect attack with increased transcript levels, protein abundance and enzyme activity. The constitutive and induced oleoresin terpenoids for conifer defense accumulate in preformed cortical resin ducts and in xylem trauma-associated resin ducts. Formation of these resin ducts de novo in the <b>cambium</b> <b>zone</b> and developing xylem, following insect attack or treatment of trees with methyl jasmonate, is a unique feature of the induced defense of long-lived conifer trees.

40|$|In vitro root {{initiation}} in Mukhikachu (Colocasia esculenta var. globulifera) {{was assessed}} in a factorial experiment using {{three levels of}} IAA (0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 mg/l), three levels of NAA (0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 mg/l) and control. Fifty percent intact shoots were used as usual, which was named as normal cut explant and the rest 50 % shoots were cut slantly to expose fresh surface i. e., <b>cambium</b> <b>zone</b> and named as slant cut explant. Low levels of IAA (0. 5 mg/l) initiated the roots earliest (≈ 14 DAC) and gave {{the highest percentage of}} root (49. 71). This treatment also gave the maximum roots/culture (3. 63). Root initiation was higher (61. 33 %) with slant cut when cultured on a medium containing 0. 5 mg/l IAA. The cultures with slant cut end also produced more number of roots and longest roots whereas, the highest root initiation (45. 05 %) was given by the treatment 1. 0 mg/l NAA, but 2. 0 mg/I NAA gave lower percentage of roots (39. 89). The maximum number of roots/culture was also obtained by 1. 0 mg/l NAA. Slant cut explant performed better regarding root initiation (%), number of roots/culture and length of roots. In this experiment, slant cut explant performed better than that of normal cut and either IAA (0. 05 mg/l) or NAA (1. 0 mg/l) might be used for root initiation in Mukhikachu...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Wood is the {{end product}} of {{secondary}} vascular system development, which begins from the cambium. The wood formation process includes four major stages: cell expansion, secondary wall biosynthesis, lignification, and programmed cell death. Transcriptional profiling is a rapid way to screen for genes involved in these stages and their transitions, providing the basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms that control this process. Results In this study, cDNA microarrays were prepared from a subtracted cDNA library (<b>cambium</b> <b>zone</b> versus leaf) of Chinese white poplar (Populus tomentosa Carr.) and employed to analyze the transcriptional profiles during the regeneration of the secondary vascular system, a platform established in our previous study. Two hundred and seven genes showed transcript-level differences at the different regeneration stages. Dramatic transcriptional changes were observed at cambium initiation, cambium formation and differentiation, and xylem development, suggesting that these up- or downregulated genes play important roles in these stage transitions. Transcription factors such as AUX/IAA and PINHEAD, which were previously shown {{to be involved in}} meristem and vascular tissue differentiation, were strongly transcribed at the stages when cambial cells were initiated and underwent differentiation, whereas genes encoding MYB proteins and several small heat shock proteins were strongly transcribed at the stage when xylem development begins. Conclusion Employing this method, we observed dynamic changes in gene transcript levels at the key stages, including cambium initiation, cambium formation and differentiation, and xylem development, suggesting that these up- or downregulated genes are strongly involved in these stage transitions. Further studies of these genes could help elucidate their roles in wood formation. </p...|$|E

[...] "While the newer {{layers of the}} wood abound in crude sap, which they convey to the leaves, those of the inner bark abound in {{elaborated}} sap, which they receive from the leaves, and convey to the <b>cambium</b> layer, or <b>zone</b> of growth. The proper juices and peculiar products of plants are accordingly found in the foliage and bark, especially the latter. In the bark, therefore, either of the stem or root, medicinal and other principles are usually to be sought, {{rather than in the}} wood. Nevertheless, as the wood is kept in connection with the bark by the medullary rays, many products which probably originate in the former are deposited in the wood." ...|$|R
