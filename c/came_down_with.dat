5|$|After he {{announced}} {{the building of}} the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> double pneumonia. He was also going blind and needed younger people to read his letters and the newspaper to him.|$|E

He served on the Western Front with the 4th Division, participating in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, but <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> jaundice and missed all but {{the last days of}} the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. He participated in the Occupation of the Rhineland before the 4th Division returned to the United States in July 1919.|$|E

In the second leg on 28 October he captained Pakistan to a 0–0 draw. However, he also had {{to withdraw from the}} squad for the SAFF Championship 2008 when he <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> food poisoning. After nearly four years out, Rehman returned to the Pakistan team for the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers.|$|E

Scully declares the case open and unsolved.|$|E

He {{also developed}} skin lesions {{that may have been}} symptoms of Kaposi's sarcoma. After finishing The Songlines in August 1986, Chatwin went to Switzerland, where he collapsed on the street. At a clinic there, he was diagnosed as HIV-positive. Chatwin provided different reasons to his doctors as to how he might have contracted HIV, including from a gang rape in Dahomey or possibly from Sam Wagstaff, the patron and lover of Robert Mapplethorpe.|$|E

5|$|In San Francisco, {{particularly}} in the Castro District, gay community activists such as Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones found a new direction in gay rights when so many men <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> strange illnesses in 1980. The San Francisco Department of Public Health began tracing the disease, linked it to certain sexual practices, and made recommendations—stop having sex—to gay men to avoid getting sick, a directive that defied the chief reason why many gay men had migrated to the Castro, and for what gay rights activists in San Francisco had fought for years. Kraus and Jones often found themselves fighting a two-fronted battle: against city politicians who would rather not deal with a disease that affected gay men, who were seen as an undesirable population, and the gay men themselves, who refused to listen to doomsday projections and continued their unsafe behavior.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} five seasons, Massillon lost only one game, a 7–0 defeat at New Castle, Pennsylvania in 1937 after several players <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> the flu. As the Tigers' {{prestige}} grew, Brown in 1936 convinced {{the school to}} build a new stadium almost triple the size of the existing 7,000-seat facility. The stadium was finished in 1939, and is now named after Brown. The pinnacle of Brown's career at Massillon was a victory in the 1940 season against Toledo's Waite High School. The Tigers and Waite both went undefeated in the 1939 season, and both claimed the state championship. The teams decided to settle the score the following year, and Brown's team won 28–0. The Massillon 1940 squad is still regarded by historians {{as one of the best}} in the history of state high school football.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} 1995–96 NCAA season, Wake Forest {{had to deal}} with the loss of Childress, who graduated the previous season and entered the NBA. This provided an opportunity for Duncan to show his leadership qualities, and his inexperienced team lost only four games in the entire ACC season. The Demon Deacons won the ACC Finals again, but in the Sweet 16, Duncan <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> the flu, and his team missed the Final Four by one win. He completed another remarkable season with averages of 19.1 points and 12.3 rebounds per game, and was again voted ACC Defensive Player of the Year and won his first ACC Player of the Year award. At the season's end the Wake Forest star was rumored to enter the 1996 NBA draft, but in the end, he stayed in college.|$|E

Also, that Jeff Hardy missed multiple flights causing him to arrive after the conclusion of the show. Hardy was subsequently suspended for this and past instances of no-showing events. Abyss and Ron Killings were the only ones to receive injuries at Hard Justice. Abyss was given a fairly deep cut {{on the top of his}} head from being bashed with a steel chair by Killings that required stitches. Meanwhile, Killings cracked his front teeth after falling face-first onto a steel chair.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October 1916, as his {{battalion}} attacked Regina Trench, Tolkien <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> trench fever, {{a disease}} {{carried by the}} lice. He was invalided to England on 8 November 1916. Many of his dearest school friends {{were killed in the}} war. Among their number were Rob Gilson of the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, who was killed {{on the first day of}} the Somme while leading his men in the assault on Beaumont Hamel. Fellow T.C.B.S. member Geoffrey Smith was killed during the same battle when a German artillery shell landed on a first aid post. Tolkien's battalion was almost completely wiped out following his return to England.|$|E
5|$|She worked {{steadily}} for {{the next}} two years as an extra in various movies, including Priscilla Dean and Colleen Moore pictures. While still a student, Wong <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> an illness identified as St. Vitus's Dance which caused her to miss months of school. She was on the verge of emotional collapse when her father took her to a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. The treatments proved successful, though Wong later claimed this had more to do with her dislike of the methods. Other Chinese thought such as Confucianism and particularly Taoism and the teachings of Laozi had a strong influence on Wong's personal philosophy throughout her life. The family's religious life also included Christian thought, in the form of Presbyterianism and as an adult she was a Christian Scientist for some time.|$|E

5|$|The 1942 Papuan {{campaign}} {{threw up}} {{a host of}} serious medical problems. The poor diet, mainly caused by the difficulty of supply by air or over jungle tracks, caused malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies. Poor hygiene led to dysentery. Malaria was hyperendemic, and when Fairley and Mackerras visited Papua in June 1942 they found high rates of infection among the troops even before the fighting had begun. At Milne Bay the incidence was so high in September 1942 {{that it looked like}} the garrison would be wiped out in a matter of months. The biggest killer, though, was typhus. Of the 2,839 soldiers who <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> it, 257 (9 percent) died. It fell to Burston promulgate the policies and practices that diminished the danger from disease and allowed the Australian Army to fight in New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|Trautmann {{joined the}} Luftwaffe as a radio {{operator}} in 1941. During training, he showed little aptitude for radio work, {{and transferred to}} Spandau to become a Fallschirmjäger (paratrooper). He served first in Occupied Poland, though being stationed far behind the front line resulted in boredom for his regiment, which resorted to sports and practical jokes to pass the time. One such practical joke involving a car backfired on Trautmann, resulting in a staff sergeant burning his arms. Trautmann was court-martialled, and received a three-month prison sentence. At {{the start of his}} confinement, Trautmann <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> acute appendicitis, and spent the remainder of his sentence in a military hospital.|$|E
5|$|Marquis {{wished to}} be sent to France, but was {{required}} first to take a course in French. In the meantime, he was assigned to a convalescent hospital. Shortly before being sent overseas, Marquis was assigned to Camp Forrest in Lytle, Georgia, an engineering camp, where he found himself treating victims of the beginning of the 1918 flu pandemic. Marquis arrived in England just as the war ended; the flu epidemic, however, had not. He continued to Cannes, where he was assigned the task of determining the capacity of hotels for use as hospitals. In January 1919 he was assigned to the Hotel Metropole as assistant to the attending surgeon. They were soon overwhelmed with influenza cases. Marquis himself <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> flu but continued working. He was reassigned to the Hotel Suisse in Nice, but, still ill, was ordered back to the US. During the long wait for transport home, he took up medical duties in Gironde, finally docking in the US in June.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} band {{received}} its record deal, the band underwent {{a series of}} misfortunes when Olander, Johnson, and Williams <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> health problems. On August 9, 1990, Johnson was injured in a carpentry accident in Arkansas a day before his 41st birthday, severely cutting his left thumb. Robert Bolin substituted for Johnson during the band's tour in Brazil with Kevin Welch and Jann Browne. On September 6, four weeks after Johnson's accident, Williams was water skiing {{with his family in}} Cookeville, Tennessee as his boat came forward at high speed when his wife was picking him up. The propellor slashed Williams' legs and he was rushed to a hospital for his injuries. Brian Helgos and Paul Gregg (Danny Gregg's brother, and a member of Restless Heart) substituted for Williams. Meanwhile, Olander discovered that he had a lemon-sized tumor that was pressing against his esophagus. The tumor was never successfully diagnosed, although it ultimately vanished.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{went back}} to China in November 1934, again serving briefly with the 4th Marines in Shanghai. He was soon reassigned as a {{legation}} guard in Peiping, where he taught the post's pistol and rifle teams to shoot competitively. They won {{at least one major}} competition. He also had time to observe the troops of the Empire of Japan, gaining great respect for their discipline. In 1936, he <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> a serious case of pneumonia and had to be evacuated from China. His next duty was at Puget Sound Navy Yard. In October 1936, he was promoted to captain. In July 1937 he entered Junior Course, Marine Corps Schools in Quantico, which he completed in May 1938. He then served as an instructor at Quantico for two years. In June 1940 he joined the 6th Marines in San Diego, and was promoted to major in April 1941.|$|E
5|$|The Sounds {{entered the}} Triple-A playing level in 1985 as an {{affiliate}} of the Detroit Tigers playing in the American Association. They played their first Triple-A game on April 11, a 3–1win, against the Buffalo Bisons at Greer Stadium. The next day, Nashville competed in an exhibition game against their major league affiliate. The Tigers outlasted the Sounds, winning by a score of 9–3 in the tenth inning. Seven games into the season, manager Lee Walls <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> an illness, and Nashville outfielder Leon Roberts became the acting manager for seven games until Gordon Mackenzie was brought on to lead the club {{for the rest of}} year. On July 17, Bryan Kelly pitched the club's second no-hitter against the Oklahoma City 89ers, in which the Sounds won, 6–0. Nashville ended the season with a 71–70 record and in second place in the Eastern Division, two-and-a-half games out of first behind the eventual league champion Louisville Redbirds.|$|E
