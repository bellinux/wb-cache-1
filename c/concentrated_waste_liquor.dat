40|$|Organic {{impurities}} in the {{fermentation broth}} of antibiotic production impose great {{difficulties in the}} crystallization and recovery of antibiotics from the <b>concentrated</b> <b>waste</b> <b>liquor.</b> In the present laboratory study, the inhibitory effect of biopolymers on antibiotic crystallization was investigated using oxytetracycline (OTC) as the model antibiotic. Organic impurities separated from actual OTC fermentation waste liquor by ultrafiltration were dosed into a pure OTC solution at various concentrations. The results demonstrated that small organic molecules with an apparent molecular weight (AMW) of below 10, 000 Da did not affect OTC crystallization significantly. However, large biopolymers, especially poly saccharides, in the fermentation waste caused severe retardation {{of crystal growth and}} considerable deterioration in the purity of the OTC crystallized. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed that OTC nuclei formed in the solution attached to the surfaces of large organic molecules, probably polysaccharides, instead of being surrounded by proteins as previously thought. It is proposed that the attachment of OTC nuclei to biopolymers would prevent OTC from rapid crystallization, resulting in a high OTC residue in the aqueous phase. In addition, the adsorption of OTC clusters onto biopolymers would destabilize the colloidal system of organic macromolecules and promote particle flocculation. OTC crystallization would therefore take place with the precipitation of abundant organic impurities. Hence, the removal of polysaccharides and other biopolymers by ultrafiltration can be an effective means of improving the recovery of OTC and similar antibiotics by crystallization from the fermentation waste.

At the same time the <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> is divided into two layers: the upper organic solvent layer and the lower aqueous layer to which has moved the bulk of soluble minerals and organic substances from plant raw material (lignin, hemicelluloses, and extractives). The use of potassium and nitrogen compounds in the cooking liquor allows the use of <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> in the manufacture of fertilizers. Previously, we have also obtained nanofibrillated cellulose (CNF) from the air-dry-bleached softwood sulfate pulp with the use of mechanochemical treatment [28].

In this research, to reduce energy consumption for preparation of nanocellulose, we used organosolv straw pulp (OSP) which was never dried after cooking and bleaching. Never-dried cellulose is better than once-dried samples because the latter are known to irreversibly lose surface accessibility as a result of drying. Using of never-dried cellulose does not require consumption of energy for drying and grinding since dried cellulose fibers lose the ability to swell and percolate due to irreversible cornification. The application of wet cellulose enables better percolation of acid into cellulose fibers.|$|R

40|$|At {{the recent}} time, the {{chemical}} industry mainly relies on fossil fuels such as oil, gas or coal for all their processes. Approximately 97  % of these resources are used for energy production, while only 3  % of all fossil fuels are provided for production of raw materials like benzene, toluene or xylene. Due to the economic growth, especially in emerging countries, the demand for energy and basic chemicals is significantly increasing. However, due to environmental reasons, the extraction of fossil materials {{is becoming more and}} more difficult. Renewable resources are a good alternative, especially as raw materials in {{the chemical industry}}. In the pulp and paper industry, where cellulose is extracted from the wood, lignin and its degradation products accrue as <b>waste.</b> The <b>waste</b> <b>liquors</b> consist of a variety of degradation and condensation products of lignin as well as inorganic compounds. Currently, the lignin degradation products are mainly burned to produce energy but they have also high potential for the usage as raw materials in the chemical industry. Furthermore, for economic and ecological reasons, the inorganic compounds should also be recovered. At this point, improved processes would be needed to produce waste liquorswith a reproducible composition. Also, there is a new process to use wood as renewable resource – the organosolv-process in lignocellulosic bioraffinery. This process uses mictures of alcohol and water to frationate wood into cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. While cellulose and hemicelluloses can be converted to sugars, applications for lignin are missing. In the first section of this work, different batches of Kraft and Organosolv liquors were characterized and compared. Especially the Kraft liquor shows significant differences from batch to batch in parameters as lignin, inorganic content or in volatile substances. The reasons for the inconstant composition of the <b>waste</b> <b>liquors</b> are that the process chemicals used are not controlled during the reaction and that the end of the reaction is determined only by kappa number. Therefore, a proper process monitoring should be implemented for an integral utilisation of wood in the pulp and paper industry. In the second step, the samples were fractionated by precipitation and extraction to isolate lignin degradation products and to recover other compounds like inorganic substances. For this purpose, various methods have been studied. In the Kraft liquor, lignin products were isolated by acid precipitation and purified by extraction. Furthermore, sulphur could be removed from isolated lignin degradation products. The Organosolv <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> contains lignin and hemicelluloses degradation products. The isolation was performed by the addition of water. A gas-chromatographic analysis of the Organosolv <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> showed many different compounds of various molecular weights. However, for further usage of the lignin degradation products only a few high-concentrated compounds with similar structures would be needed. A possible method to generate uniform molceluar structures is a thermal treatment. After thermal degradation, the condensed compounds were separated by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography and identified by mass spectrometry. Different monomers like substituted Guaiacyl- and Sinapyl-structures were determined. The condensed thermolysis products were compared to the compounds of the <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> and it is shown that thermolysis results in degradation to mono- and dimeric substances. This means, that there is a great potential to uniform the lignin degradation products by thermolysis and use them as renewable aromatic materials in the chemical industry...|$|R

With development of organic extractants for separating and recovering these fission products, solvent extraction offers a versatile alternative to ion-exchange, precipitation, and crystallization procedures heretofore used for small-scale recoveries. A process flowsheet was developed for the recovery of strontium and mixed rare earths from adjusted Purex 1 WW solution {{by the use of}} di(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D 2 EHPA). After adding tartrate t complex the iron and caustic to adjust the pH to 6, strontium and rare earths are co-extracted and then co-stripped with nitric acid in the first cycle. In additional D 2 EHPA extraction cycles, they are isolated as concentrated fractions. The mixed rare earths from this process can be treated by tributyl phosphate (TBP) extraction to separate the individual rare earth elements of which promethium and cerium are of greatest interest. Zirconium [...] niobium also may be recovered with D 2 EHPA from acidic <b>waste</b> <b>liquors.</b> An amine pretreatment extraction process was developed for removing nitric acid, iron sulfate, zirconium [...] niobium, and ruthenium from waste solutions to furnish a feed liquor more amenable to subsequent processes for recovering fission products. The separate recovery of ruthenium, zirconium [...] niobium, and rare earths may also be possible by amine extraction. A process based on the use of substituted phenols was developed for recovering cesium from alkaline waste solutions. These compounds are selective extractants for cesium, giving high decontamination from other fission products and sodium, and they are readily stripped with dilute nitric acid.

Oxytetracycline was concentrated more than 3 times to 3000 - 4000 mg/l in the retentate. Due to likely the high concentration of large biopolymers interacting with OTC molecules, OTC could not be successfully recovered from the RO retentate by conventional crystallization. With additional treatment of ultrafiltration by 3 K membranes, OTC crystallization and recovery from the RO retentate were significantly improved with a recovery ratio of more than 60 % and a purity of higher than 80 %. Detailed studies indicated that most large biopolymers in the OTC liquor were polysaccharides that would either hinder the growth of OTC crystals or precipitate together with OTC molecules.

It {{is necessary to}} determine the oxygen demanded for the oxidative decomposition. As one method for measuring chemical oxygen demand (COD), permanganate oxidation is mainly used in Japan, and the procedure is authorized as Japan Industrial Standard (JIS). We tested utilities of the method using soluble starch, egg white albumin, lignosulfonate solution and their mixtures with metal sulfate as model of <b>waste</b> <b>liquor.</b> COD of these macromolecules were variously changed {{by the addition of}} metal ions. Above all, COD of soluble starch solution was remarkably diminished by divalent ions, such as Cu^ 2 + and Mg^ 2 +, trivalent ion Fe^ 3 + and monovalent K^+. The extent diminished was about 40 % in each mixture. Such conspicuous diminution of COD was not found in albumin-or LSA-metal ion mixture. COD of LSA-Cu^ 2 + mixture augmented more than that of LSA solution by a factor of 1. 1. In the mixture containing two sorts of macromolecules, COD also diminished by the addition of metal ions. These experimental results show that COD of the macromolecule solution measured can resist against permanganate oxidation. As this poorly-oxidizable complex was not conformed irreversibly, COD of the starch-metal mixture, above all, gradually increased as time passed. These experimental results show that COD of the macromelecule solution measured by permanganate consumption (JIS method) changes and always diminishes remarkably by the co-existence with other macromolecule and metal ion. Then, it may be concluded that JIS method can not be successfully adopted as a general one to analyze many kinds of <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> which varies the sorts and the content of organic and inorganic matter. The incompleteness of the method is due to the weak oxidative potentiality of permanganate reagent. Development of rapid COD analytical methods using more stronger oxidizing agent such as dichromate are claimed. Measurement of TOC (total organic carbon) is more favorable as the more strict indicator of water-pollution control, though the analytical procedure is yet unsettled. 各種排水中の有機物は微生物によつてあるいは非生物的に酸化分解されるので,その汚染度を規定するためには酸化分解に要する酸素量を測定する必要がある. この化学的酸素要求量(COD) を測定する方法としては,わが国では過マンガン酸酸化によるものが主に用いられており,本法は日本工業規格(JIS) に表示されている. 排水のモデルとして,可溶性でんぷん,卵白アルブミン,LSA溶液およびそれらの金属硫酸塩との混液を用いて本法の有効性を検定した. これらの高分子物質のCODは金属イオンの添加によつて変化し,その程度は高分子物質と金属イオンの組み合せによつて異なつていた. 特に可溶性でんぶん溶液のCODはCu^ 2 ＋,Mg^ 2 ＋などの二価イオン,さらにFe^ 3 ＋およびK^+によつて著しく減少した. しかしアルブミン－,LSA－金属塩混液では顕著なCODの減少は認められなかつた.

The effect of cooking parameters such as alkali charge, maximum cooking temperature, and time at maximum temperature on bamboo kraft pulping adding additive Diethylene Triamine Penta Methylene Phosphonic Acid was studied. The {{results show that the}} optimized bamboo kraft pulping conditions are: alkali charge 17 %, maximum cooking temperature 162 ˚C, and time at maximum temperature 60 min when DTPMPA dosage is 0. 4 %. On the optimized conditions of cooking, the highest screened bamboo pulp yield 49. 52 %, the kappa number of bamboo pulp is 24. 68, residual alkali in kraft <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> 3. 62 g/L...|$|R
40|$|Utilization of {{renewable}} resources {{is becoming increasingly}} important, and only sustainable processes that convert such resources into useful products can achieve environmentally beneficial economic growth. Wastewater from the {{pulp and paper industry}} is an unutilized resource offering the potential to recover valuable products such as lignin, pigments, and water [1]. The recovery of lignin is particularly important because it has many applications, and membrane technology has been investigated as the basis of innovative recovery solutions. The concentration of lignin can be increased from 62 to 285 g∙L− 1 using membranes and the recovered lignin is extremely pure. Membrane technology is also scalable and adaptable to different <b>waste</b> <b>liquors</b> from the pulp and paper industry...|$|R
50|$|Designs {{were drawn}} for a LILW {{facility}} {{as early as}} 1993, with an ideal plan detailing five interconnected disposal caverns, holding either ILRW or LLRW. Plans were drawn for two disposal caverns for ILRW, one for dry LLRW, two for concentrated and DAW LLRW, and one LLRW repository for spent resins and filters, and <b>concentrated</b> <b>wastes.</b> Each cavern is designed to slope towards the entrance to prevent pooling of groundwater.|$|R

It {{has been shown that}} attached biocenosis, free-floating biocenosis and also bio-module rotation frequency  have exerted a significant influence on the process of an aerobic sewage treatment. It has been established that combined bio-oxidizers can be used for cleaning high <b>concentrated</b> <b>waste</b> water at the enterprises of food industry. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Gerrymandering is the {{manipulation}} of electoral district boundaries for political gain. By creating a few [...] "forfeit" [...] districts where opposing candidates win overwhelmingly, gerrymandering politicians can manufacture more, but narrower, wins {{for themselves and their}} party. Gerrymandering relies on the wasted-vote effect, effectively <b>concentrating</b> <b>wasted</b> votes among opponents while minimizing wasted votes among supporters. Consequently, gerrymandering is typically done under voting systems using single-member districts, which have more wasted votes.|$|R
