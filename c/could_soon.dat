5|$|The city of Bastogne, Belgium was a hub {{of several}} major roads {{and became a}} prime target for the Germans, seeing its capture as {{necessary}} to their advance. Middleton was in continuous communication with Bradley at 12th Army Group headquarters in Luxembourg, and maintained that though Bastogne <b>could</b> <b>soon</b> be surrounded, it should be held. As the Germans advanced on Bastogne, both Bradley and First Army commander Hodges recognized the threat to Middleton and had him move his headquarters. He was supposed to leave Bastogne on 18 December, but spent another night there {{so that he could}} brief his relief force, the 101st Airborne Division. Not only did that division's acting commander, Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe, show up ahead of schedule, but so did Colonel William Roberts from the 10th Armored Division Combat Command R (CCR), sent by Patton. Another welcome guest arriving later that evening was Major General Matthew Ridgway, commander of XVIII Airborne Corps, en route to his headquarters, but advised by Middleton to stay in Bastogne for the night to avoid capture by the Germans. While Middleton and his guests slept, elements of the 101st Airborne poured into Bastogne all during the night and into the following day.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the problem}} of soil erosion in these city areas are known, little {{has been done to}} address the issue. Few {{small-scale}} projects have demonstrated an ability to help protect the integrity of the soil, but no scalable ones have been implemented due to lack of funding. Soil erosion is also considered such a serious matter that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has sent agents to inspect the reactor in Kinshasa and concluded that soil erosion <b>could</b> <b>soon</b> threaten the safety of nuclear power plants.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, all {{academic}} staff were poorly paid {{and there were}} no incentives for good work or penalties for poor practice. At AAU, {{academic staff}} could increase their income with additional work outside the university. This was not stopped because it would result in loss of experienced teachers. There was resentment that Indian professors were paid {{more than twice as much}} as Ethiopian professors. MU had the potential for improvement but, given low pay and possible opportunities for work in new private colleges, they <b>could</b> <b>soon</b> resemble AAU. JU, being in a remote area, had no opportunities for outside work, so staff were fully engaged with their work but they would leave if given the opportunity. Staff thought teaching was not up-to-date or based on practice because research was not being done. Staff were relying on foreign teaching materials and textbooks which might not relate to the Ethiopian situation. Class sizes and resource shortages meant that laboratory work, practical work, field work, essays and projects were gradually being phased out. Courses were reduced to theory without practice thus encouraging rote learning to pass exams.|$|E
25|$|The split of 1955-56 largely {{involved}} tactical {{disagreements over}} how to move the UE's progressive program and brand of unionism forward {{in the face of}} the AFL-CIO merger. It proved a bitter disappointment to UE activists who had managed to bring the union successfully through the hardest years of the McCarthy period and the Cold War but who were now unable to keep the union together. Most locals in the UE's New York-north Jersey district (UE District 4) voted to go into the IUE reasoning that they had the strength and experience to influence the policies of the newer union. While this move was resented by UE activists elsewhere, especially in Pennsylvania and the midwest, the District 4 activists felt that the UE forces <b>could</b> <b>soon</b> have regained control of the re-united organization had the whole union followed their lead. By the mid-1960s, the former UE activists in IUE shops played a role in helping to bring about James Carey's ouster in a disputed election. Carey's departure eventually opened the way for the co-ordinated bargaining which partially healed the two decade old division in the industry.|$|E

500|$|Korean {{popular music}} (K-pop), {{considered}} {{by some to be}} the most important aspect of the Korean Wave, is a music genre that relies on cultural technology to adapt to the tastes of foreign audiences and has now grown into a popular subculture among teenagers and young adults in many places around the world. Although it has spread to the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and parts of South America, its reception in the Western world has so far been lukewarm. However, social media networks such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter have made it easier for K-pop musicians to reach a wider audience in the West. According to Mark James Russell from Foreign Policy, while the Korean Wave [...] "may not (yet) turn heads in Los Angeles or London", this <b>could</b> <b>soon</b> change because of [...] "Gangnam Style".|$|E
500|$|Area Congressman John Doolittle {{was one of}} {{the largest}} proponents of the Auburn Dam, and he {{appropriated}} several million dollars for funds to conduct feasibility studies for the dam. About $3 million went into the main feasibility report, and the remaining $1 million was used for a study concerning the relocation of California State Route 49, which runs through the site. After the Hurricane Katrina disaster in 2005, Doolittle drew public attention to the flood vulnerability of the Sacramento region. He also used the flood-protection [...] "incompetence" [...] of the Folsom Dam to his advantage, saying that [...] "without an Auburn Dam we <b>could</b> <b>soon</b> be in the unenviable position of suffering from both severe drought and severe flooding in the very same year." [...] He led all 18 Republican members of the United States House of Representatives from California in a protest in 2008, trying to convince Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to revoke the water-rights decision that California had made against Reclamation. Doolittle is sometimes known as the Auburn Dam's [...] "chief sponsor".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{operations}} on {{his throat and}} having taken the sea air at Cowes, Frederick remained hoarse, and was advised by Mackenzie to spend the coming winter on the Italian Riviera. In August, following reports {{that his father was}} gravely ill, he considered returning to Germany, but was dissuaded by his wife, and went to Toblach in South Tyrol with his family, where Victoria had rented a house. He arrived in Toblach on 7 September, exhausted and hoarse. Concerned by Frederick's lack of visible improvement after a brief meeting with Frederick in Munich, Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg consulted the distinguished laryngologist Max Joseph Oertel, who urged a drastic and thorough operation on Frederick's throat, and said he suspected a benign tumour which <b>could</b> <b>soon</b> become malignant. By this time, Mackenzie's treatment of Frederick was generating strong criticism. After a fortnight in Toblach, Mackenzie arrived to reexamine Frederick, who had continued to suffer from colds and hoarseness; in public, however, the doctor remained largely unconcerned, and attributed the hoarseness to a [...] "momentary chill." [...] However, he recommended that Frederick should leave Toblach for Venice, to be followed by Victoria. The weather soon turned cold, and Frederick's throat caused him pain, for which he received cocaine injections.|$|E

500|$|The {{team was}} formed in August 1995 when Scott Antol signed a WCW {{contract}} and was placed with [...] "tag team specialist" [...] Marcus Alexander Bagwell. In the process, both men changed their ring names, Antol changing his last name to [...] "Riggs" [...] and Bagwell shortening his name to simply Marcus Bagwell. Once together, they both wore short shorts and leather vests [...] (later wrestling tights and suspenders) to the ring and began clapping their hands over their head in time with their entrance music, which sang their praises between choruses of the team name being repeated over and over. They wrestled on the first episode of Nitro, defeating World Tag Team Champions Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck in a non-title match. [...] Their first major appearance together came at the Fall Brawl pay-per-view, where they defeated The Nasty Boys in a match that aired on Main Event. Pro Wrestling Illustrated magazine stated that the team [...] "work well as a unit and <b>could</b> <b>soon</b> challenge for the belts". Bagwell commented on the team in a scripted interview, saying that he believed that his previous tag teams had failed {{because they were in}} a rush to win the title belts and that he planned to work slowly toward a title victory with Riggs.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} summer, 1943, the USAAF fighters {{operated}} over German air {{space for the}} first time. Several aircraft crashed near Aachen {{on the cusp of}} Germany's west border. Galland presented these wrecks as proof that the Luftwaffe was facing an enemy that <b>could</b> <b>soon</b> escort its heavy bombers with fighter aircraft to industrial targets inside Germany. Galland submitted his findings to Göring. Göring was livid with Galland and the fighter force. The Reichsmarschall called the report the [...] "rantings of a worn-out defeatist", and gave Galland an [...] "order", that no Allied fighters had crossed into Germany. Göring declared the only possible reason could have been that short range fighters ran out of fuel at high altitude and [...] "they were shot down much further west... and glided quite a distance before they crashed. Galland and Milch denied this. Galland questioned why an Allied pilot would choose to glide east instead of west. Both men also argued that they must increase fighter production to reach a three or fourfold advantage over the attackers immediately to prepare for this new threat. Galland's efforts to produce a fighter force fit for a war of attrition conflicted with Göring's bias in favour of bombers, to maintain the offensive on all fronts. It was a policy the Reichsmarschall persisted with until the autumn, 1943.|$|E
