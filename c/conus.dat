One of dozens of toxins made by the deadly cone snail <b>Conus</b> geographus is used as Prialt in pain relief.|$|E
5|$|In {{the adult}} fish, the four {{chambers}} are not {{arranged in a}} straight row but, instead form an S-shape with the latter two chambers lying above the former two. This relatively simpler pattern is found in cartilaginous fish and in the ray-finned fish. In teleosts, the <b>conus</b> arteriosus is very small and can more accurately be described {{as part of the}} aorta rather than of the heart proper. The <b>conus</b> arteriosus is not present in any amniotes, presumably having been absorbed into the ventricles over the course of evolution. Similarly, while the sinus venosus is present as a vestigial structure in some reptiles and birds, it is otherwise absorbed into the right atrium and is no longer distinguishable.|$|E
5|$|Many {{carnivorous}} marine gastropods {{are known}} predators of L.canarium, including the volutes Cymbiola nobilis and Melo melo and the cone snail (<b>Conus</b> textile). The dog conch is also preyed upon by vertebrates. These include the crab-eating macaque, Macaca fascicularis, an opportunistic predator that scours intertidal environments. Humans {{are one of}} the dog conch's main predators, subjecting the species to intensive fishing and exploitation.|$|E
5|$|Primitive {{fish have}} a four-chambered heart, but the {{chambers}} are arranged sequentially {{so that this}} primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. The first chamber is the sinus venosus, which collects deoxygenated blood, from the body, through the hepatic and cardinal veins. From here, blood flows into the atrium {{and then to the}} powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action will take place. The fourth and final chamber is the <b>conus</b> arteriosus which contains several valves and sends blood to the ventral aorta. The ventral aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal aorta, into the rest of the body. (In tetrapods, the ventral aorta has divided in two; one half forms the ascending aorta, while the other forms the pulmonary artery).|$|E
5|$|In {{the heart}} of lungfish, the septum extends part-way into the ventricle. This allows for some degree of {{separation}} between the de-oxygenated bloodstream destined for the lungs and the oxygenated stream that is delivered {{to the rest of}} the body. The absence of such a division in living amphibian species may be partly due to the amount of respiration that occurs through the skin; thus, the blood returned to the heart through the venae cavae is already partially oxygenated. As a result, there may be less need for a finer division between the two bloodstreams than in lungfish or other tetrapods. Nonetheless, in at least some species of amphibian, the spongy nature of the ventricle does seem to maintain more of a separation between the bloodstreams. Also, the original valves of the <b>conus</b> arteriosus have been replaced by a spiral valve that divides it into two parallel parts, thereby helping to keep the two bloodstreams separate.|$|E

25|$|Software improvements, to be {{implemented}} by September 2008, significantly improve signal availability of vertical guidance throughout the <b>CONUS</b> and Alaska. Area covered by the 95% available LPV solution in Alaska improves from 62% to 86%. And in the <b>CONUS,</b> the 100% availability LPV-200 coverage rises from 48% to 84%, with 100% coverage of the LPV solution.|$|E
25|$|The {{clinical}} {{course and}} the response to therapy is different for these groups, showing a better prognosis {{for those in the}} NMO-Ab(−)/MOG-Ab(−) group, and a worse prognosis for those in the NMO-Ab(+)/MOG-Ab(+) group. The MOG-related neuromyelitis optica can be radiologically identified by the <b>conus</b> involvement.

25|$|Insulin is {{produced}} by beta cells of the pancreatic islets in most vertebrates and by the Brockmann body in some teleost fish. Cone snails <b>Conus</b> geographus and <b>Conus</b> tulipa, venomous sea snails that hunt small fish, use modified forms of insulin in their venom cocktails. The insulin toxin, closer in structure to fishes' than to snails' native insulin, slows down the prey fishes by lowering their blood glucose levels.|$|E
25|$|Patterns of some seashells, {{like the}} ones in <b>Conus</b> and Cymbiola genus, are {{generated}} by natural cellular automata. The pigment cells reside in a narrow band along the shell's lip. Each cell secretes pigments according to the activating and inhibiting activity of its neighbor pigment cells, obeying a natural version of a mathematical rule. The cell band leaves the colored pattern on the shell as it grows slowly. For example, the widespread species <b>Conus</b> textile bears a pattern resembling Wolfram's rule 30 cellular automaton.|$|E
25|$|During Desert Shield/Desert Storm, 135 {{members were}} {{activated}} {{and served in}} both <b>CONUS</b> and OCONUS locations. Aircrews from the 189th flew 123 mission sorties in support of Desert Shield/Desert Storm without affecting the unit's day-to-day aircrew training mission.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wings}} of Hebomoia glaucippe is present glacontryphan-M, a peptide toxin {{belonging}} to the family contryphan that are active constituents of the poisonous venom produced by cone snail (genus <b>Conus).</b> In H. glaucippe this toxin should function as a defence against predators.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{class of}} invertebrate Gla-containing proteins is synthesized by the fish-hunting snail <b>Conus</b> geographus. These snails produce a venom containing hundreds of neuroactive peptides, or conotoxins, which is sufficiently toxic to kill an adult human. Several of the conotoxins contain {{two to five}} Gla residues.|$|E
25|$|The OMEGA {{navigation}} {{system and the}} LORAN-C transmitters outside the USA were run until 1994 also by the United States Coast Guard, and LORAN-C transmitters within the US were decommissioned on June 1, 2010, {{with the exception of}} 5 <b>CONUS</b> LORAN-C stations that continue to be manned due to international agreements.|$|E

25|$|JLTV is {{transportable}} by sea, rail, and air. The JLTV will be transportable on {{all classes}} of ocean-going transport ships with minimal dis-assembly. It {{is required to}} be rail-transportable on <b>CONUS</b> and NATO country railways. Air transportability will be by fixed-wing aircraft as large as or larger than the C-130 Hercules and sling-loadable with rotary-wing aircraft such as the CH-47/MH-47, and CH-53. The ambulance variant must be air-dropable by C-5 and C-17 fixed-wing aircraft. The JLTV can be prepared in 30 minutes for transport by aircraft, Maritime Prepositioning Force ships or rail. This is aided by an adjustable-height suspension.|$|E
25|$|All <b>CONUS</b> Hercules batteries, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the ones in Florida and Alaska, were deactivated by April 1974. The remaining units were deactivated during the spring of 1979. Dismantling of the sites in Florida – Alpha Battery in Everglades National Park, Bravo Battery in Key Largo, Charlie Battery in Carol City and Delta Battery, located on Krome Avenue on the outskirts of Miami – started in June 1979 and was completed by early autumn of that year. The buildings that once housed Delta Battery became the original structures used for the Krome Avenue Detention Facility, a federal facility used primarily to hold illegal aliens awaiting immigration hearings. In Anchorage, Alaska, Site Point (A Battery) was converted into a ski chalet for Kincaid Park. Site Summit (B Battery) still sits above Eagle River, its IFC buildings and clamshell towers easily visible when driving towards Anchorage. Site Bay (C Battery), across Cook Inlet from the others, has been mostly demolished, with only burned out shells of the batteries remaining, as well as a few storage bunkers. The large airstrip remains, and is often used by locals for flight instruction and practice.|$|E
25|$|The US Military Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) uses near {{real time}} data from the 148 <b>CONUS</b> based National Weather Service Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD or WSR 88-D) system to provide current bird hazard {{conditions}} for published military low-level routes, ranges, and military operating areas (MOAs). Additionally AHAS incorporates weather forecast data with the Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) to predict soaring bird activity within the next 24 hours and then defaults to the BAM for planning purposes when activity is scheduled outside the 24-hour window. The BAM is a static historical hazard model based on many years of bird distribution data from Christmas Bird Counts (CBC), Breeding Bird Surveys (BBS), and National Wildlife Refuge Data. The BAM also incorporates potentially hazardous bird attractions such as landfills and golf courses. AHAS is now {{an integral part of}} military low-level mission planning, aircrew being able to access the current bird hazard conditions at www.usahas.com. AHAS will provide relative risk assessments for the planned mission and give aircrew the opportunity to select a less hazardous route should the planned route be rated severe or moderate. Prior to 2003, the US Air Force BASH Team bird strike database indicated that approximately 25% of all strikes were associated with low-level routes and bombing ranges. More importantly these strikes accounted for more than 50% of all of the reported damage costs. After a decade of using AHAS for avoiding routes with severe ratings, the strike percentage associated with low-level flight operations has been reduced to 12% and associated costs cut in half.|$|E
500|$|Cauda equina {{syndrome}} (CES) {{results from}} a lesion below {{the level at which}} the spinal cord splits into the cauda equina, at levels L2–S5 below the <b>conus</b> medullaris. Thus it is not a true spinal cord syndrome since it is nerve roots that are damaged and not the cord itself; however it is common for several of these nerves to be damaged at the same time due to their proximity. CES can occur by itself or alongside <b>conus</b> medullaris syndrome. It can cause low back pain, weakness or paralysis in the lower limbs, loss of sensation, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and loss of reflexes. Unlike in <b>conus</b> medullaris syndrome, symptoms often occur on only one side of the body. The cause is often compression, e.g. by a ruptured intervertebral disk or tumor. [...] Since the nerves damaged in CES are actually peripheral nerves because they have already branched off from the spinal cord, the injury has better prognosis for recovery of function: the peripheral nervous system has a greater capacity for healing than the central nervous system.|$|E
500|$|<b>Conus</b> medullaris {{syndrome}} is {{an injury to}} the end of the spinal cord, located at about the T12–L2 vertebrae in adults. This region contains the S4–S5 spinal segments, responsible for bowel, bladder, and some sexual functions, so these can be disrupted in this type of injury. [...] In addition, sensation and the Achilles reflex can be disrupted. Causes include tumors, physical trauma, and ischemia.|$|E

500|$|Loring {{was built}} on [...] of land, making it the biggest SAC base in the country. This in turn allowed for it to have the largest {{capacity}} for weapon storage and for fuel storage in all of SAC. (Its overall capacity ranked second among all 21 SAC bases). The weapons storage capacity was the highest in all of SAC, 10,247,882 NEW (Net Explosive Weight), and it was first in all of SAC in fuel storage capacity (9,193,374 gallons). Fuel was delivered to the base via a 200-mile pipeline to Searsport, Maine. Ramp space at Loring exceeded 1.1 million square yards, which made it second among all SAC bases in total ramp space, and first in excess ramp space. Furthermore, {{it was one of}} two fully capable conventional weapons storage facilities in <b>CONUS</b> maintained by SAC.|$|E
500|$|No {{report on}} the {{effectiveness}} of Operation Shed Light as a whole exists. It is known that there was some discontent among some of its major participants. General John D. Ryan, Commander in Chief of the Pacific Air Forces, complained following the poor showings from the Tropic Moon II program that he was “tired of buying everything they send us.” [...] He then requested that his staff draft a message that would allow him to send “this thing [...] to <b>CONUS</b> [...]” [...] Even in regards {{to the development of the}} Tropic Moon III aircraft, the Aeronautical Systems Division was forced to admit that the myriad of delays in that program had been caused by [...] "reduced quality control" [...] springing from the [...] "crash" [...] nature of the program.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, in the Journal of Molluscan Studies, Puillandre, Duda, Meyer, Olivera & Bouchet {{presented}} a new classification {{for the old}} genus <b>Conus.</b> Using 329 species, the authors carried out molecular phylogenetic analyses. The results suggested that the authors should place all cone snails in a single family, Conidae, containing four genera: <b>Conus,</b> Conasprella, Profundiconus and Californiconus. The authors group 85% of all known cone snail species under <b>Conus,</b> They recognize 57 subgenera within <b>Conus,</b> and 11 subgenera within the genus Conasprella[...]|$|E
2500|$|The last {{comprehensive}} treatise {{dealing with}} the family Conidae {{as a whole was}} the [...] "Manual of the Living Conidae", by Röckel, Korn & Kohn (1995). [...] Only one genus, <b>Conus,</b> was used for the entire family, the authors stating that they considered there was still insufficient scientific data at that time to accurately define the diversity of the family. [...] The <b>Conus</b> Biodiversity Website, by Alan J. Kohn and Trevor Anderson, notes that there are more than 500 recognized extant species of <b>Conus,</b> out of 3,253 species names published between 1758 and 2007. [...] As of the date of The <b>Conus</b> Biodiversity Website's last update in October 2007, only the genus <b>Conus</b> is recognized for the entire family.|$|E
2500|$|In 1937, J.R. Tomlin {{advocated}} {{that all}} cone snail species {{should be placed}} in the single genus [...] <b>Conus</b> in the family Conidae, with the explanation that [...] "the grouping of the Cones is as yet so little understood that I have made no attempt to deal with the growing number of subgenera and genera into which <b>Conus</b> has been dismembered." [...] In 1979, Jerry G. Walls emulated Tomlin by confining all species to the genus <b>Conus,</b> stating that [...] "although many subgenera or genera have been devised for the cones, only the single genus <b>Conus</b> with no subgenera is recognized here." [...] Subsequent experts in the field of cone snail taxonomy followed Tomlin and Walls, and retained all species of cones in the single genus [...] <b>Conus,</b> making the Conidae a monogeneric family. [...] This traditional Linnaean classification system, [...] placing all species of cones in the single genus <b>Conus,</b> continued for decades before a malacologist proposed a different classification system.|$|E
2500|$|The family Taranteconidae was {{proposed}} by Tucker and Tenorio for the unusual species Taranteconus chiangi Azuma, 1972 (equivalent to <b>Conus</b> chiangi), {{based upon their}} cladistical analysis. [...] In 2010, a molecular phylogeny conducted by M. Watkins, et al. found that, based upon molecular studies, <b>Conus</b> chiangi (Azuma, 1972) falls within the Stephanoconus clade with 100% certainty. [...] Further, <b>Conus</b> chiangi has peptide toxins that are virtually identical {{to those of the}} other Stephanoconus species.
