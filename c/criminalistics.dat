25|$|Plaa {{was born}} in San Francisco on May 15, 1930, the son of Jean and Lucienne Plaa, a couple of Basque French immigrants. He {{graduated}} from the University of California in 1952 with a bachelor's degree in <b>criminalistics.</b> The previous year he had married his wife, Colleen Neva; the couple would have eight children. After a brief interlude during which he served in Korea with the U.S. Army Reserve, he returned to complete graduate studies. Unable to obtain a stipend, he was offered to reorient toward pharmacology and toxicology, which he did, earning his M.Sc. in 1956 and his Ph.D. in 1958.|$|E

25|$|Plaa's primary area of {{research}} was hepatotoxicity, in which his successes where achieved primarily by the investigation of mechanistic toxicology. His primary contributions were {{in the areas of}} cholestasis and toxic potentiation, in particular potentiation by haloalkanes. Although the use of the isolated perfused liver was already well-known, having been first used in the early 19th century, Plaa was the first to use it for the study of hepatotoxicity. A long-time career goal for him was to elaborate methods to determine human hepatotoxicity (and particularly cholestasis-inducing abilities in drugs) from animal tests; although this endeavour was never a success, it led to a much improved understanding of the mechanisms of cholestasis. According to Plaa, much of his mechanisms- and protocols-oriented research was an effect of his original formation in <b>criminalistics.</b>|$|E
