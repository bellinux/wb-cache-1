5|$|Lake-effect snow is {{produced}} during cooler atmospheric conditions when a <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> moves across long expanses of warmer lake water, warming the lower layer of air which picks up water vapor from the lake, rises {{up through the}} colder air above, freezes and is deposited on the leeward (downwind) shores.|$|E
5|$|The December 1960 nor'easter was a {{significant}} early-season winter storm that impacted the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions of the United States. Moderate to heavy snowfall fell from West Virginia to eastern Maine, amounting to 10in (25cm) or more in parts of 13states and peaking at 21.4in (54.4cm) at Newark, New Jersey. The storm was accompanied by strong winds, gusting to over 90mph (145km/h) in coastal New England, and left in its wake a dangerously <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass.</b> The storm originated in a weak low pressure area which formed over the western Gulf of Mexico on December 10. A secondary low developed over South Carolina on the next day, supported by the merger of two troughs aloft. Sliding southeast of New England, the new storm explosively deepened to become a full-fledged nor'easter, with a minimum central air pressure of 966 mbar. It began to weaken over the Canadian Maritimes.|$|E
5|$|All {{these facts}} are {{consequences}} of the thermal wind relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on {{the mass of the}} parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction, and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses, one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence {{of the fact that the}} Equator is warmer than the North and South poles.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} slant {{back into}} <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> and strengthen with height, sometimes exceeding 30,000feet (approximately 9km) in depth.|$|R
5000|$|In a warm occlusion, the <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> {{overtaking}} {{the warm}} front {{is not as}} cold as the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> ahead of the warm front, and rides over the <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> while lifting the warm air.|$|R
50|$|The {{formation}} of climate in Azerbaijan is influenced particularly by <b>cold</b> arctic <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> of Scandinavian anticyclone, temperate of Siberian anticyclone, and Central Asian anticyclone. Azerbaijan's diverse landscape affects the ways <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> enter the country. The Greater Caucasus protects {{the country from}} direct influences of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> coming from the north. That leads to the {{formation of}} subtropical climate on most foothills and plains of the country. Meanwhile, plains and foothills are characterized by high solar radiation rates.|$|R
25|$|The strongest part of jet streams {{should be}} in {{proximity}} where temperature gradients are the largest. Due to land masses in the northern hemisphere, largest temperature contrasts are observed {{on the east coast}} of North America (boundary between Canadian <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> and the Gulf Stream/warmer Atlantic) and Eurasia (boundary between the boreal winter monsoon/Siberian <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> and the warm Pacific). Therefore, the strongest boreal winter jet streams are observed over east coast of North America and Eurasia. Since stronger vertical shear promotes baroclinic instability, the most rapid development of extratropical cyclones (so called bombs) is also observed along the east coast of North America and Eurasia.|$|E
500|$|Sea surface {{temperature}} (SST) is {{the water temperature}} close to the ocean's surface. [...] The exact meaning of surface varies according to the measurement method used, but it is between [...] and [...] below the sea surface. [...] Air masses in the Earth's atmosphere are highly modified by sea {{surface temperature}}s within a short distance of the shore. [...] Localized areas of heavy snow can form in bands downwind of warm water bodies within an otherwise <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass.</b> [...] Warm sea surface temperatures {{are known to be}} a cause of tropical cyclogenesis over the Earth's oceans. [...] Tropical cyclones can also cause a cool wake, due to turbulent mixing of the upper [...] of the ocean. [...] SST changes diurnally, like the air above it, but to a lesser degree. There is less SST variation on breezy days than on calm days. [...] In addition, ocean currents such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), can effect SST's on multi-decadal time scales, a major impact results from the global thermohaline circulation, which affects average SST significantly throughout most of the world's oceans.|$|E
500|$|A surface low {{can form}} {{in a variety}} of ways. Topography can create a surface low. Mesoscale {{convective}} systems can spawn surface lows that are initially warm core. The disturbance can grow into a wave-like formation along the front and the low is positioned at the crest. Around the low, the flow becomes cyclonic. This rotational flow moves polar air towards the equator {{on the west side of}} the low, while warm air move towards the pole on the east side. A cold front appears on the west side, while a warm front forms on the east side. Usually, the cold front moves at a quicker pace than the warm front and [...] "catches up" [...] with it due to the slow erosion of higher density air mass out ahead of the cyclone. In addition, the higher density air mass sweeping in behind the cyclone strengthens the higher pressure, denser <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass.</b> The cold front over takes the warm front, and reduces the length of the warm front. At this point an occluded front forms where the warm air mass is pushed upwards into a trough of warm air aloft, which is also known as a trowal.|$|E
50|$|Fayetteville has a humid {{subtropical}} climate (Köppen Cfa). Fayetteville experiences all four seasons and does receive <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> from the north, however {{some of the}} Arctic masses are blocked by the higher elevations of the Ozarks.|$|R
5|$|The strongest {{high-pressure}} {{areas are}} associated with <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> which push away out of polar regions during the winter when there is less sun to warm neighboring regions. These Highs change character and weaken once they move further over relatively warmer water bodies.|$|R
5000|$|Seligman lies in {{the humid}} {{subtropical}} climate zone (Köppen Cfa), and experiences all four seasons, generally with hot, humid summers and cold winters, occasionally receiving <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> from the north. Seligman lies {{just east of the}} area known colloquially as [...] "Tornado Alley." ...|$|R
500|$|Warm fronts {{mark the}} {{position}} on the Earth's surface where a relatively warm body of air has displaced colder air. The temperature increase {{is located on the}} equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lies within broader low pressure troughs than is the case with cold fronts. Warm fronts move more slowly than do the cold fronts because cold air is denser, and harder to displace from the Earth's surface. This causes temperature differences across warm fronts to be broader in scale. The warm air mass overrides the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> and temperature changes occur at higher altitudes before those at the surface. [...] Clouds ahead of the warm front are mostly stratiform and rainfall gradually increases as the front approaches. Fog can also occur preceding a warm front passage. Clearing and warming is usually rapid after the passage of a warm front. If the warm air mass is unstable, mixing of the warm moist air will produce thunderstorms that are embedded among the stratiform clouds ahead of the front, and after frontal passage, thundershowers may continue. On weather maps, the surface location of a warm front is marked with a red line of half circles pointing in the direction of travel.|$|E
500|$|Fronts in {{meteorology}} are {{the leading}} edges of air masses that have a density, air temperature, and humidity different from the air mass it is invading. When an air mass passes over an area, it is marked by changes in temperature, moisture, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, and often {{a change in the}} precipitation pattern. The change is called a front, whether it be warm or cold. Cold fronts develop when cold air masses, usually moving equatorward from the polar region high pressure zones, interact with warm moist air of [...] low pressure systems. The fronts develop at the leading edge of that <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> and wrap around (counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere) about the low pressure zone. [...] A polar front may form approximately along the equatorward edge of the high-level polar jet. Fronts are guided by winds aloft, but they normally move at lesser speeds than those winds. In the northern hemisphere, they usually travel from west to east, although they can move in a north-south direction as well as they may wrap around an associated low pressure zone. Movement is driven by the pressure gradient force (horizontal differences in atmospheric pressure) and the Coriolis force (caused by the Earth's rotation on its axis). Frontal zones can be distorted by such geographic features as mountains and large bodies of water.|$|E
500|$|Deemed a [...] "hybrid storm", the cyclone rapidly {{intensified}} in warm {{waters of}} up to [...] from the Gulf Stream combined with a <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> over the United States. The system continued to rapidly intensify while moving within the Gulf Stream; it developed central convection, an unusual trait for an extratropical cyclone, {{and at one point}} exhibited an eye. Despite these indications of tropical characteristics, [...] "There was no front associated with it and it had a warm core, but the radius of maximum winds was more than , so under the standard NHC criteria it didn't qualify as a tropical storm." [...] On December 23 and 24, the nor'easter intensified to attain a barometric pressure of [...] An upper-level low pressure system that developed behind the storm began to intensify and grew to be larger in size than the original disturbance. In an interaction known as the Fujiwhara effect, the broad circulation of the secondary low swung the primary nor'easter northwestward towards southern New York and New England. The original low passed along the south shore of Long Island, and made landfall near New York City on December 24. Subsequently, it moved over southeastern New York State. On December 25, the system began to rapidly weaken as it moved towards Nova Scotia, before the pair of low pressure systems moved out to sea in tandem {{in the early hours of}} December 26.|$|E
500|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed when a cold front overtakes a warm front, and usually forms around mature low-pressure areas. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into {{the point of}} occlusion, which {{is also known as}} the triple point. [...] It lies within a sharp trough, but the <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. [...] In a <b>cold</b> occlusion, the <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front and plows under both <b>air</b> <b>masses.</b> [...] In a warm occlusion, the <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> overtaking the warm front is warmer than the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> ahead of the warm front and rides over the <b>colder</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> while lifting the warm air.|$|R
5000|$|The {{prevailing}} winds in {{the middle}} latitudes are often very strong. These {{parts of the world}} also see a wide variety of fast-changing weather as <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> from the poles and warm <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> from the tropics push up and down over them, sometimes alternating within hours of each other, especially in the roaring forties (between 40 and 50 degrees latitude in both hemispheres).|$|R
50|$|A Lake Effect Snow Watch is a {{bulletin}} {{issued by the}} National Weather Service in the United States to warn of heavy snowfall amounts that will be possible from convective snow generated by <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> passing over unfrozen lakes (lake effect snow).

2500|$|Thunderstorms usually occur about 2 to 5 {{days per}} month during this period. Summer {{precipitation}} in Seoul is {{as likely to}} occur at 0200 as at 1400. Humidity is very high and fog will develop whenever a <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> confronts this moisture laden air, often forming on cloudless days. The typhoon season occurs from July through September. About once each year, a typhoon will pass very close to or move over Korea, causing heavy showers. Strong winds are usually confined to islands and exposed coastal areas. Although winds might not pose a problem, the associated rainfall can cause significant flash flooding, a very real threat during the rainy season, especially in rough terrain. The mean temperature for Seoul in August is 25.7°C (78°F) ...|$|E
50|$|Blocking {{occurs when}} a {{well-established}} poleward high-pressure system lies near or within {{the path of the}} advancing storm system. The thicker the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> is, the more effectively it can block an invading milder air mass.

50|$|The {{characteristic}} {{plant for}} this region is the vine, almost exclusively covering the landscape.

50|$|The {{area of the}} Bay of Kotor has a humid {{subtropical}} climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa) with significantly more rain in the winter than in the summer.

50|$|The {{storm was}} formed from an extratropical cyclone {{off the coast}} of South Carolina on February 5. An Arctic cold front and a <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> then merged with the storm, {{creating}} the perfect ingredients for a large and intense low-pressure system.|$|E
50|$|Overnight, the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass,</b> {{along with}} a cold front, moved eastward into New York and the New England area. In {{the days before the}} storm, the New England region was {{experiencing}} significant heat, with a high culminating at 90 °F (32 °C) on June 6. However, the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass,</b> an unusually strong one, lowered temperatures across the region. The temperature in Worcester dropped over 15 degrees to 74 °F (24 °C) on June 8. The presence of the air mass created the chance for warm air from the Southern United States to clash with the cold front. This phenomenon, which is the way most tornadoes and severe thunderstorms are formed, is something that would not normally happen in the New England region.|$|E
5000|$|Temperatures also range by {{latitude}} {{across the}} region. In January, average temperatures range from -15 C {{in the southwest}} to -30 C in the northwest. In the summer, the range is from 20 C {{in the south to}} 20 C in the north. [...] Because the terrain is flat, <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> from the Arctic can penetrate deeply.|$|R
50|$|Snowfall is {{very rare}} as it is {{normally}} too dry to snow when <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> reach the Bootheel, so that the median is only 0.4 in per year and the mean just 5.7 in.

50|$|The {{climate is}} {{determined}} mainly by {{the influence of}} western transfer of <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> from the Atlantic Ocean, interrupted often by invasion of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> from the Arctic {{in the rear of}} cyclones. In general, the climate of Pushchino is moderately continental, with moderately cold winters, warm summers and fairly stable humidity. In winter invasions of the Atlantic cyclones are usual, which lead to frequent thaws and raise of the temperature to 5-8 °C.|$|R
50|$|Lake-effect snow is {{produced}} during cooler atmospheric conditions when a <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> moves across long expanses of warmer lake water, warming the lower layer of air which picks up water vapor from the lake, rises {{up through the}} colder air above, freezes and is deposited on the leeward (downwind) shores.|$|E
50|$|Warm fronts occur {{where the}} warm air pushes out a {{previously}} lodged <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass.</b> The warm air overrides the cooler air and moves upward. Warm fronts are followed by extended periods of light rain and drizzle, because, after {{the warm air}} rises above the cooler air (which remains on the ground), it gradually cools due to the air's expansion while being lifted, which forms clouds and leads to precipitation.|$|E
50|$|The days 6, 7 and 8 July 2007, saw {{the entry}} of a polar <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass,</b> {{and as a result}} on Monday 9 July, the {{simultaneous}} presence of very cold air in both middle levels of the atmosphere and at the surface, leading to the occurrence of precipitation in the form of sleet and snow. It was the third time that a snowfall occurred in the partido. It also snowed in 1912 and 1918.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} Georgia is {{extremely}} diverse, considering the nation's small size.

The Lesser Caucasus Mountains partially protect the region from the influence of dry and hot <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> from the south.|$|R
5000|$|Climate {{formation}} in Azerbaijan {{is influenced by}} various <b>air</b> <b>masses.</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses,</b> such as the Kara and Scandinavian arctic anticyclones, the temperate Siberian anticyclones, and the maritime Azores maximum influence the climate. Likewise, tropical hot <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> (subtropical anticyclone and southern cyclones), as well as Central Asian anticyclones and local weather conditions, have influence. These <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> enter the country in different ways thanks to its varied geography.
