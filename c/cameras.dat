In December 2009, Lamb wrote to leaders in the House and Senate, requesting that negotiations for health care reform be televised by C-SPAN. Committee meetings on health care were broadcast subsequently by C-SPAN and may be viewed on the C-SPAN website. In November 2010, Lamb wrote to incoming House Speaker John Boehner requesting changes to restrictions on <b>cameras</b> in the House. In particular, C-SPAN asked to add some of its own robotically operated <b>cameras</b> to the existing government-controlled <b>cameras</b> in the House chamber. In February 2011, Boehner denied the request. A previous request to Speaker Designate Nancy Pelosi in 2006, to add C-SPAN's <b>cameras</b> in the House chamber to record floor proceedings, was also denied. Although C-SPAN uses the congressional chamber feed cables, the <b>cameras</b> are owned and controlled by each respective body of Congress.

5|$|Filming {{took place}} {{throughout}} April 2009. Before it began, production designer Anthony Ainsworth partly reconstructed the Grid set {{to give it}} more of a concrete, underground bunker, feel. Though more television series in the UK are adopting high-definition <b>cameras,</b> the Spooks producers decided to continue using hand held standard-definition ones, which were more compact and flexible; the producers felt that using high-definition <b>cameras</b> would sacrifice the filming style of the series. For instance, a hand held camera would allow the crew to film one long take following cast members through tight spaces, like an average London flat.
