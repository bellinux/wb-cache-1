We decompose the effect of a public capital change into three different pieces that we refer to as wage, rental rate and tax effect, respectively.

40|$|The {{impact of}} local fiscal policy {{depends on the}} choice of the tax base. In this paper, we take four {{criteria}} to evaluate tax bases, namely: efficiency, simplicity, flexibility, and fairness. The results of such an evaluation depend on how we describe the involved agents. We construct a two stage model of a local economy with three types of agents: Leviathans, households, and housing firms. Each Leviathan seeks to maximize the surplus of his local fiscal budget. Each household seeks to maximize its life-time utility from three types of goods: composite private goods, housing, and local public goods. Each housing firm seeks to maximize its profits. In this model, we analyze the characteristics of four distinct tax bases: land rent, housing <b>capital</b> <b>rent,</b> housing sales, and housing property. In particular, we analyze the responses of the households, the housing firms, and the housing prices on a change of a specific tax rate. The results are used to evaluate each tax base with respect to our four criteria. ...|$|E

Under both specifications, the numerical results show that the CU is welfare enhancing and causes a reduction of the urban-rural wage gap as suggested by theoretical studies. At the same time, it leads to rural-to-urban migration and raises the <b>capital</b> <b>rent,</b> results that are counter intuitive with respect to the dual economy literature. Furthermore, the rise in formal labor demand and the migration response to the CU have not resulted in an increase in urban unemployment (i. e. the "Todaro paradox"), but rather to a fall in the unemployment pool.

40|$|An {{increasingly}} important organisational design problem for many firms is to recoup general human <b>capital</b> <b>rents</b> while maintaining attractive career prospects for workers.

Choosing different statistics affects the extent of regression to the mean which, we show, in turn affects the incidence of adverse selection among retained and released workers. Using this observation, we detail how optimal information management policies vary across firms with different human capital management priorities. This view of human capital management via information management has strong implications for labour market outcomes. We discuss the impact on average wages, wage inequality, wage skewness and labour turnover rates. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a simple model of energy saving investments under uncertainty of energy costs. Adjustment delays in replacing energy-intensive capital follow from two natural elements: uncertainty and heterogeneity {{of the existing}} capital structure.

To provide a quantitative assessment of the consumer price increase needed for the investments, adjustment delays, and policies expediting the change, {{the elements of the}} model are estimated using electricity market data. Counterfactual simulations show that large scale entry of green energy requires unprecedented energy cost and consumer price increases mainly due to rents of the existing capital.

40|$|Neoclassical economists {{argue that}} {{competition}} promotes efficiency. They consider technology as given though. In {{the long run}} technological progress is an important determinant {{of the level of}} welfare and Schumpeter argued that monopoly rents help entrepreneurs to capture the gains of R&D and hence to invest in it. We investigate the overall effect of competition on performance. Performance is measured by TFP-growth. As a negative measure of competition we use rent. Rent is defined as the excess factor rewards over and above their perfectly competitive values (marginal productivities). Input-output analysis enables us to calculate rent for the Canadian sectors over a thirty-year period and to decompose it in its capital and labor components. In line with the literature we find that rent has no significant influence on productivity. We find an interesting result however: the components influence performance in opposite directions. <b>Capital</b> <b>rent</b> has a positive role and labor rent a negative one. The neoclassical economists and Schumpeter seem both right, but the mechanisms differ. The use of rent as a source of funding for R&D applies to capital and the argument that rent yields slack pertains to labor. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact on}} {{internal}} migration {{of the recent}} Customs Union (CU) agreement between Turkey and the European Union (EU) has been studied with an intra-industry trade Applied General Equilibrium (AGE) model with intersectoral capital mobility, under two alternative specifications for the labour market: the traditional Harris- Todaro approach {{and the existence of}} a 'wage curve' in the urban sector. The numerical results show that, under both specifications, the CU leads to migration from rural to urban areas, despite agriculture remaining protected; causes a reduction of the urban unemployment rate and the urban-rural wage gap as suggested by theoretical studies; whilst raises the <b>capital</b> <b>rent,</b> a counter intuitive result with respect to the dual economy literature. Both scenarios suggest that internal migration is economically desirable, as it would contribute to a large rise in welfare. The study also shows that the proposal of uniformly subsidising the entire labour market maximises welfare, but the possibility that the high wage union sector can cream off more rents, and the large amount of financial resources required, make this policy unfeasible. It might be thought that the results of this kind of exercise would be highly sensitive to the assumptions made about the labour market.

The government has designed several fiscal policies, including reducing the fuel subsidy. The study objective is to analyse the impact of reducing fuel subsidy on macroeconomic variables, agricultural sector, and income distribution. The modification on the basic model, which is a recursive-dynamic CGE model, is made in this study. The data used in the model is of the Indonesian I-O Table 2000, The Indonesian Social Accounting Matrix 2000, National Household Survey data and parameter from some other sources. The {{results show that the}} reduction in fuel price subsidy tends to increase prices of industrial outputs that highly depend on fuel, such as transportation and fishery sectors. In contrast, the change in fuel price does not influence the price of paddy. Wage of skilled labor, land rent, and <b>capital</b> <b>rent</b> decline steadily in response to the change in fuel price. Households will lose their income following the reduction in fuel subsidy, which then decreases the welfare of households. Incomes are not evenly distributed within the society (household groups). An increased fuel price at consumer level declines the Indonesian real GDP. The government should give the compensation of reducing the fuel subsidy directly to the poor people. The compensation can also be given directly to the poor people through the development of infrastructure, which may solve some supply side bottlenecks in the economy.

The sunk costs nature of human capital investments may result from the need to satisfy ever increasing specialised skill requirements in our society.

This inefficiency results from the hold-up problem that arises since workers are not residual claimants of the human <b>capital</b> <b>rents.</b> On the other hand, since insiders ´ investments are negatively correlated {{with the number of}} workers, this may lead to higher than efficient investments nevertheless.
