5|$|Originally, {{the grass}} on the putting greens was the wide-bladed Bermuda. The greens lost speed, {{especially}} during the late 1970s, after {{the introduction of a}} healthier strain of narrow-bladed Bermuda, which thrived and grew thicker. In 1978, the greens on the par 3 course were reconstructed with bentgrass, a narrow-bladed species that could be mowed shorter, eliminating grain. After this test run, the greens on the main course were replaced with bentgrass in time for the 1981 Masters. The bentgrass resulted in significantly faster putting surfaces, which has required a reduction in some of the <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greens over time.|$|E

5|$|One {{theory is}} that the sculptures {{represent}} deceased individuals with bloated bodies, closed eyes, distended bellies and puffed out faces. The position of the limbs on some monuments, although following the natural <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boulder, give an impression of the position of corpses found in later Maya burial bundles. It is possible that Pasaco Monument 2 and the potbelly from San Juan Sacatepéquez portray the placement of a jade bead in the mouth of the sculpture. Although {{it has been suggested that}} the monuments themselves are burial markers, only three sculptures have been found directly associated with human remains. One of these is a ceramic potbelly from Colha in Belize, the others are from Chalchuapa and Kaminaljuyu. However, since most potbelly monuments were not found in their original locations it is impossible to know whether they originally served as burial markers.|$|E

30|$|True FISP is not {{suitable}} for visualizing <b>the</b> inner <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artery but is suitable for visualizing its outer contour. The true-FISP technique was originally designed for improved visualization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cerebrospinal fluid [41]. Attributes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> true-FISP sequence include a relatively high image signal-to-noise ratio and rapid data acquisition, which yields diminished sensitivity to motion. These attributes are favorable for depicting the outer surface appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arterial wall. However, pulsation artifacts (inhomogeneous signal) within the arteries are frequent on true-FISP images [42]. Additionally, the signal intensity on true-FISP is reduced when the flow velocity is more than 30  cm/s [10]. Therefore, true FISP is {{not suitable}} for <b>the</b> imaging <b>of</b> fast flow velocity; that is, true-FISP MR imaging alone is {{not suitable for}} visualizing <b>the</b> inner <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artery. True FISP reflects the outer surface appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intracranial arterial wall, whereas TOF MRA mainly reflects the blood flow within the artery, representing <b>the</b> inner <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artery.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: In low-bit-rate speech communication, speech coding deteriorates <b>the</b> {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coded speech significantly. An {{important feature}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speech {{is the fundamental}} frequency contour which determines <b>the</b> pitch information <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speech. It has been known that pitch information is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core parameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multi-pulse based code excited linear prediction (MP-CELP) speech coder. Therefore <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deteriorated fundamental frequency contour should be conducted properly. Approach: This study proposes an analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fundamental frequency <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coded speech based on MP-CELP speech coder. <b>The</b> comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fundamental frequency <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural speech and that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coded speech has been performed. The MP-CELP with three levels of bitrate scalability is selected as the core speech coder. The speech material includes a hundred of male speech utterances and a hundred of female speech utterances. Results: The experimental {{results show that the}} speech coder causes <b>the</b> deterioration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fundamental frequency <b>contour</b> empirically. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between <b>the</b> fundamental frequency <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural speech and that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coded speech for three different bitrates has been conducted. The lower bitrate causes <b>the</b> higher value <b>of</b> RMSE. Conclusion: From the study, it is a proved that the MP-CELP speech coder deteriorates <b>the</b> fundamental frequency <b>contour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transmitted speech...|$|R
5|$|The accompaniment for a Peking opera {{performance}} usually {{consists of}} a small ensemble of traditional melodic and percussion instruments. The lead melodic instrument is the jinghu, a small, high-pitched, two-string spike fiddle. The jinghu is the primary accompaniment for performers during songs. Accompaniment is heterophonic – the jinghu player follows the basic <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song's melody, but diverges in pitch and other elements. The jinghu often plays more notes per measure than the performer sings, and does so an octave lower. During rehearsal, the jinghu player adopts {{his or her own}} signature version of the song's melody, but also must adapt to spontaneous improvisations {{on the part of the}} performer due to changed performance conditions. Thus, the jinghu player must have an instinctive ability to change his or her performance without warning to properly accompany the performer.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{the lake}} was fed by the River Westbourne {{entering}} at the Italian Garden at the north-western end of the Long Water. The Westbourne ceased to provide the water for the Serpentine in 1834, as the river had become polluted, and so water was then pumped from the Thames. The water is now supplied by three boreholes drilled into the Upper Chalk. The first borehole {{is located at the}} Italian Gardens, the second at the Diana Memorial and the third, drilled in 2012 to a depth of 132m, is within 50m of the Diana Memorial. The Long Water runs south-east from this point to Serpentine Bridge, where the lake curves to the east, following the natural <b>contours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land. At the eastern end, water flows out of the lake via a sluice in the dam, forming a small ornamental waterfall at the Dell. The outflow has not historically maintained the waterfall, and re-circulation pumps were installed in the Dell, below the dam, to sustain this feature. The restoration work in 2012 restored the flows into the Serpentine and this waterfall is now restored as originally designed. Historically the river flowed due south from this point, marking the boundary between Westminster and Kensington, but since 1850 it has been diverted into a culvert, running underground to reach the Thames near Chelsea Bridge.|$|E
