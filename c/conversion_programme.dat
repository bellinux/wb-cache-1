5|$|From {{the start}} of the war to mid-1941, Coastal Command had only one {{functioning}} Operational Training Unit (OTU). Officially it had to provide training for 17 units. The pressure on the OTU was such that it offered little more than a <b>conversion</b> <b>programme</b> for pilots and crews hoping to man land-based aircraft. In 1940, Bomber Command was asked to support Coastal forces, even though at that time in the war it overstretched itself. Requests to the Air Ministry to meet outstanding OTU requirements were largely ignored. The single landplane OTU was established to train 1.1 crews per month. This figure, on the outbreak of war, proved grossly inadequate.|$|E

40|$|Population {{decrease}} in many East-German towns and municipalities does not only increase {{the stock of}} empty residential buildings. It also makes provision of network-related goods and services more costly. Considering public {{water and sewerage services}} as example, the article investigates empirically how costs of provision per inhabitant depend on population number and -density. Diverging from similar studies, spatial differences in distribution costs per inhabitant are calculated within the area of a case study municipality. The calculations are based on cost accounting data of the local provider. A central problem is the choice of an appropriate spatial key figure to allocate costs. The results indicate cost advantages in providing densely populated quarters with network-related services. Consequently, rising per-capita costs should be taken into account to a greater extent for the city <b>conversion</b> <b>programmes</b> in East Germany than they have been up to now. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to airlines often wanting {{to phase out}} their early production ATR models to replace them with the latest generation ATR series, {{as well as to}} answer demand from cargo operators for the type, ATR has operated two separate dedicated freighter <b>conversion</b> <b>programmes,</b> known as the Bulk Freighter (tube version) and the ULD Freighter. Both conversions involve complete stripping of furnishings along with the addition of floor strengthening, new window plugs and 9g restraining nets, six additional longitudinal tracks for added flexibility, and an E-Class cabin; the ULD model can accommodate standard ULD-packaged cargo, such as LD3 containers or 88x108in (2.2x2.7m) pallets, which were loaded via a large cargo door located on the port forward side. Undertaken by a range of companies, such as Alenia subsidiary Aeronavali, Texas-based M7 Aerospace; French firms Indraéro Siren and Aeroconseil, Canadian Infinion Certification Engineering, and Spanish company Arrodisa, by October 2012, in excess of one-fifth of all first-generation ATR 42 and ATR 72 aircraft had already been converted to freighters.|$|R

The survey is a follow up of Robert Holley’s study “Results of a ‘Survey on Bibliographic Control and National Bibliography’ ” that was carried out in 1996. All parts of the world are represented by 52 responses. The main findings of this survey are that legal deposit legislation still emphasises textual material but many agencies presently revise their legislation to include more types of material, in particular electronic documents. Furthermore, print remains the preferred format for national bibliographies but more and more agencies are focusing on Internet access.

40|$|Dry matter {{production}} and pasture composition were measured over 22 months in eight cropping sequences on a dryland site converted from forest to pasture. Cropping sequences involved different combinations of: (i) autumn and spring sowing; (ii) sowing immediately into pasture or into oat and triticale forage crops followed by pasture; and (iii) undersowing pasture beneath rape or conventional sowing. Annual DM production varied little among treatments (mean 6. 8 t DM/ha) once pastures {{were established in}} all sequences. Sites sown directly into pasture in autumn had a high (27 %) annual legume content in the first spring but a low annual legume content in the second spring (< 3 %).

40|$|The {{strategic}} {{location of}} Sardinian isle in the Mediterranean has determined an extraordinary variety of military architecture typologies {{as a consequence}} of the several dominations occurred during time: coastal towers, bastions and fortresses, strongholds, citadels, garrison stations, barracks, former prisons, World War II sites and NATO headquarters. The study is specifically dedicated to one of the Carabinieri military stations, as a specific typology of military architecture, characterized by exceptional widespread dissemination, strategic location and interesting constructive features. The Corps of the Royal Carabinieri was instituted in Turin by the by Royal Warrant of the King of Sardinia, Vittorio Emanuele I, on 13 th July 1814. This military Corp had the dual function of firstline national defence and policing using special powers and prerogatives. The Force was given a territorial task and was organized into divisions, one for each province. The divisions were called Companies and they were subdivided into Lieutenancies which commanded and coordinated the local police stations, and were distributed throughout the national territory to maintain direct contact with the public. The buildings planned to host the stations consist of small buildings that are usually located in the historic centres of small municipalities, close to the Town Hall and the church to form a sort of institutional square. They were usually characterized by great stability and simple decorations. Typically, they have a modular plan which was designed by the central government and repeated all over Italy. The research included the preliminary implementation of a database, with geographical references, for the creation of a digital catalogue of the most interesting buildings, also useful for the understanding of their cultural values and for the proposal of their insertion in the list of the national monuments. The study focuses on the possible reuse of these buildings after decommission. The restoration and refurbishment of these historical defense sites could represent a key opportunity for different needs, such as culture, social, education and housing, due to their modularity and easy adaptability in terms of efficient and sustainable transformation. However, some case studies illustrated in the paper, prove that a certain kind of adaptive reuse could irremediably affect the military memory of these places, so that visitors are no more able to understand the defense history of the sites. Undoubtedly, an effective strategy needs the synergic work of a multidisciplinary team of restorers, architects, historians, designers, economists and sociologists in order to set up informed value based <b>conversion</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at {{assessing}} {{the potential of}} partially superconducting generators for 10 MW direct-drive wind turbines by investigating their performance for a very wide range of excitation currents. Performance indicators such as shear stress and efficiency and other generator characteristics are compared for 12 different generator topologies. To be sufficiently attractive, superconducting generators must have significant advantages over permanent magnet direct-drive generators, which typically have shear stresses {{of the order of}} 53 kPa and efficiencies of 96 %. Therefore, we investigate what excitation is required to obtain a doubled shear stress and an efficiency of 98 %. To achieve this, the different topologies require a range of excitation from 200 to 550 kAt (ampere-turns) with a low armature current density of 2 A/mm 2. The more iron that is used in the core of these topologies, the easier they achieve this performance. By examining the maximum magnetic flux density at the location of the superconducting field winding, feasible superconductors can be chosen according to their engineering current density capabilities. It is found that high- and low-temperature superconductors can meet the performance criteria for many of the topologies. MgB 2 superconductors are feasible for the fully iron-cored topology with salient poles but need cooling down to 10 K.

40|$|When {{designing}} buildings, it is {{a challenge}} to take into account Energy Efficiency in the early design stage. This is especially difficult for hospital designs, because these buildings comprise many different room types and functions. This greatly increases the number of design directions available. Choices made early on in the design process have a large impact on the final performance of the building. However, the lack of detailing available in early designs makes it hard to evaluate them in terms of Key Performance Indicators. The Semantic Labels developed as part of the STREAMER project provide a way to address this problem, by allowing structured capture of the most relevant aspects of the Program of Requirements. Using this method, design rules can be applied to early building designs to detect and correct inconsistencies or suboptimal solutions. Also, using default values for label values, an early design can already be evaluated using simulation tools. The Semantic labels describe standard values for Construction (floor height and strength, accessibility), Hygiene class (from public spaces to operational theatres), Equipment (electric power requirements, safety), User profile (when the room is used), Comfort class (like daylight) and Access security (who can enter). Design rules may express conditions like the preferred spatial separation between rooms, or whether rooms should be placed at outer walls, but may also highlight incompatibilities in e. g. access requirements and user profiles. The Early Design Configurator, also under development as part of the STREAMER project, uses the Semantic Labels to allow automatic <b>conversion</b> of a <b>Programme</b> of Requirements, into an initial Building Information Modeling (BIM) design proposal that respects the design rules...|$|R
