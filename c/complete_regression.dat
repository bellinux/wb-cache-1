40|$|Incomplete {{spontaneous}} {{regression of}} melanoma is common. However, <b>complete</b> melanoma <b>regression</b> {{is still a}} very rare phenomenon. Because melanoma is the most immunogenic human malignancy, the mechanisms leading to regression, based on accumulative evidence, are the host's immune responses. Unfortunately, therapies aiming to enhance the patient's natural immunity against melanoma have yet to meet their expectations. Reasons for failure include various immune escape mechanisms, induced by the tumor, that subsequently lead to tolerance. Here, we performed time-dependent gene expression profiling to unravel molecular changes involved in the transition of progressive melanoma to <b>complete</b> tumor <b>regression</b> using a porcine model. The melanoblastomabearing Libechov minipigs are highly suitable for this study because these animals exhibit naturally occurring and regressing melanomas.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Injection of {{dendritic}} cells (DC) engineered with recombinant adenoviral vectors {{to produce}} interleukin- 12 (IL- 12) inside experimental murine tumors frequently achieves <b>complete</b> <b>regressions.</b> In {{such a system}} the function of CD 8 (+) T cells {{has been shown to}} be an absolute requirement, in contrast to observations made upon depletion of CD 4 (+) T cells, which minimally affected the outcome. The aim of this work was to study the possible involvement of natural killer (NK) cells in this setting. MATERIALS, METHODS, AND RESULTS: Depletions with anti-AsialoGM 1 antiserum showed only a small decrease in the proportion of <b>complete</b> <b>regressions</b> obtained that correlated with induction of NK activities in lymphatic tissues into which DC migrate, whereas combined depletions of CD 4 (+) and NK cells completely eliminated the antitumor effects. Likewise in vivo neutralization of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) also eliminated those therapeutic effects. Trying to define the cellular role played by NK cells in vivo, it was observed that injection of cultured DC inside the spleen of T- and B-cell-deficient (Rag 1 (-/-)) mice induced upregulation of NK activity only if DC had been adenovirally engineered to produce IL- 12. In addition, identically transfected fibroblasts also activated NK cells, indicating that IL- 12 transfection was the unique requirement. Equivalent human DC only activated in vitro the cytolytic and cytokine-secreting functions of autologous NK cells if transfected to express human IL- 12. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results point out an important role played by NK cell activation in the potent immunotherapeutic effects elicited by intratumoral injection of IL- 12 [...] secreting DC and that NK activation under these conditions is mainly, if not only, dependent on IL- 12...|$|R

40|$|Background: Description {{of three}} cases of metastatic esophageal {{carcinoma}} to the iris {{and focus on}} management strategies. Methods: A 48 -year-old man (Case 1) with previously treated stage IV esophageal carcinoma presented with blurred vision in the left eye (OS) for 3 weeks. Initial fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) was negative for malignant cells, so incisional biopsy was performed and confirmed metastatic carcinoma. A 53 -year-old man (Case 2) with previously treated stage III esophageal cancer experienced 2 months of pain and 1 month of blurred vision OS. Documented tumor growth suggested esophageal carcinoma metastasis. A 65 -year-old man (Case 3) with previously treated stage IV esophageal carcinoma developed hyphema in the right eye (OD), and FNAB confirmed metastatic carcinoma.
