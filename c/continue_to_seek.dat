The International Organization for Migration and the Australian government have declared Tamil refugees as economic migrants. Canada has tightened controls on their refugee program due to various abuses within the Canadian refugee system. A Canadian government survey found that over 70% of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees {{have gone back to}} Sri Lanka for holidays raising concerns over the legitimacy of their refugee claims.|$|E
5|$|The Council of Indigenous Peoples {{consider}} several limited {{factors in}} a successful formal petition. The determining factors include collecting member genealogies, group histories {{and evidence of}} a continued linguistic and cultural identity. The lack of documentation and the extinction of many indigenous languages {{as the result of}} colonial cultural and language policies have made the prospect of official recognition of many ethnicities a remote possibility. Current trends in ethno-tourism have led many former Plains Aborigines to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> cultural revival.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects on}} the Adriatic itself were slight, the action only {{confirming}} the already overwhelming British dominance in the region. The French Navy would <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> reinforcements for their squadrons, concentrating {{on the construction of}} several new ships in Italian seaports that would not be ready until 1812. As a result, this was the last significant action {{of the year in the}} Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|Time has {{undergone}} several restorations because of deterioration and decline caused by natural and urban elements. During the late 1990s {{and the first}} few years of the 21st century it underwent repairs that corrected many of the problems caused by these earlier restorations. Although extensive renovation of the sculpture was completed as recently as 2005, the supporters of Time <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> resources for additional lighting, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation has nominated it for further funding.|$|E
5|$|Bragg {{retained}} his position, relieving or reassigning {{the generals}} who had testified against him, and retaliated against Longstreet by reducing his command to only those units {{that he brought}} with him from Virginia. Despite the dysfunctional command climate under Bragg, and the lack of support from the War Department and President Davis concerning Bragg's removal, Longstreet did the best he could to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> options in the Chattanooga Campaign. While Bragg resigned himself and his army to the siege of the Union Army of the Cumberland in Chattanooga, Longstreet devised a strategy to prevent reinforcement and a lifting of the siege by Grant. He knew this Union reaction was underway, and that the nearest railhead was Bridgeport, Alabama, where portions of two Union corps would soon arrive. After sending his artillery commander, Porter Alexander, to reconnoiter the Union-occupied town, he devised a plan to shift most of the Army of Tennessee away from the siege, setting up logistical support in Rome, Georgia, to go after Bridgeport to take the railhead, possibly catching Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker and arriving Union troops from the Eastern Theater in a disadvantageous position. The plan was well received and approved by President Davis, but it was disapproved by Bragg, who objected to the significant logistical challenges it posed. Longstreet accepted Bragg's arguments and agreed to a plan in which he and his men were dispatched to East Tennessee to deal with an advance by the Union Army of the Ohio, commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside. Longstreet was selected for this assignment partially due to enmity on Bragg's part, but also because the War Department intended for Longstreet's men to return to Lee's army and this movement was in that direction.|$|E

5|$|On {{release of}} Guitar Hero 5, 35 {{of the songs}} from World Tour and 21 from Smash Hits are importable into Guitar Hero 5 for a small fee (approximately $0.10 per song), and are treated as {{downloadable}} content for the game playable in all game modes; the World Tour export was available on release, while the Smash Hits export was available a few days afterwards. Furthermore, 61 of the 65 tracks from Band Hero are importable into Guitar Hero 5. All transferred songs are also playable in Band Hero. However, Guitar Hero 5 is not backwards-compatible with World Tour. The transfer process requires the player to enter a unique code from the World Tour or Smash Hits manual {{to be able to}} redownload available songs in a pack (on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3) or individual songs (on the Wii) that have been updated to include the new features. Players on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 can delete individual songs after downloading the pack. Some songs are not transferable because of licensing issues—not technical issues—according to Bright. Tim Riley, the head of music licensing at Activision, stated that the company will <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> licenses for more songs from previous games and downloadable content to be exported into Guitar Hero 5, but cannot guarantee that these songs will be licensed for future Guitar Hero games. While reviewers appreciated Activision's efforts to allow the importing of songs from previous games, they felt that the small number of tracks that were available at launch was at odds with the impression that Activision had made of the process before the game's release.|$|E

The Cheyenne program was canceled by the Army on 9 August 1972. The helicopter's large size and inadequate night/all-weather capability were reasons stated by the Army for the cancellation.|$|E

On March 14, 2006, Brinkema ruled that the prosecution could <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> the death penalty against Moussaoui, but could not use key witnesses coached by Martin. On April 3, 2006, the jury in his case decided that Moussaoui was eligible for the death penalty.|$|E

25|$|On August 12, 2013, BlackBerry {{announced}} {{the intention to}} sell the company due to their increasingly unfavourable financial position and competition in the mobile industry. Largely due to lower than expected sales on the Z10, BlackBerry announced on September 20, 2013 that 4,500 full- and part-time positions (an estimated 40% of its operating staff) have been terminated and its product line has been reduced from six to four models. On September 23, 2013, Fairfax Financial, which owns a 10% equity stake in BlackBerry, made an offer to acquire BlackBerry for $4.7 billion (at $9.00 per share). Following the announcement, BlackBerry announced an acceptance of the offer provisionally but it would <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> other offers until November 4, 2013.|$|E
25|$|With {{respect to}} the failure to pay U.S. federal income tax, some tax protesters miss the {{distinction}} between civil and criminal liability. A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial for non-payment of income tax does not relieve a defendant of civil liability (i.e., the legal obligation to pay the tax). After a criminal acquittal, the IRS can <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> money through levy or other lawful means. Generally, {{the amount of money}} due to the IRS is determined administratively by the IRS, and not in a criminal trial. (The amount of tax may, however, be calculated after the guilty verdict is reached in a criminal case—for purposes of determining the severity of the sentence.) Although there have been several well-publicized cases of acquittal in a criminal tax case, the IRS continues collection efforts, with many defendants finally seeking refuge in bankruptcy court.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, with no endemic malaria, the {{prevalence}} of sickle-cell anaemia among African Americans is lower (about 0.25%) than in West Africa (about 4.0%) and is falling. Without endemic malaria, the sickle-cell mutation is purely disadvantageous and tends to decline in the affected population by natural selection, and now artificially through prenatal genetic screening. However, the African American community descends from a significant admixture of several African and non-African ethnic groups and also represents the descendants of survivors of slavery and the slave trade. Thus, a lower degree of endogamy and, particularly, abnormally high health-selective pressure through slavery {{may be the most}} plausible explanations for the lower prevalence of sickle-cell anaemia (and, possibly, other genetic diseases) among African Americans compared to West Africans. Another factor that limits the spread of sickle-cell genes in North America is the absence of cultural proclivities to polygamy, which allows affected males to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> unaffected children with multiple partners.|$|E
