5|$|After the {{revolution}} was quelled, the old flags were restored and {{the revolution}}aries punished for having worn the tricolor. In 1849, domnitor Barbu Dimitrie Ştirbei adopted a new design for military <b>colors</b> <b>that</b> nevertheless preserved the colors’ horizontal layout and only changed decorative elements. Similar to the 1834 flag, this one lasted until 1856.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{relatively}} large fruiting bodies of R.pulcherrimus are distinctive, {{they might be}} confused with superficially similar species, such as Rubroboletus eastwoodiae; the latter species has a much thicker stalk. Another similar species is R.haematinus, which may be distinguished by its yellower stem and cap <b>colors</b> <b>that</b> are various shades of brown. Its darker cap and lack of reticulation on the stipe differentiate it from R. satanas.|$|E

5|$|In the 1989 {{specifications}} {{issued to}} the Ecuadorian Military, the {{coat of arms}} has only eight <b>colors</b> <b>that</b> are used on the flag. The eight colors are yellow, blue, red (all from the national flag), sky blue, green, grey, silver and gold. There is also a nine piece instruction on how to draw the coat of arms, followed by a full color drawing and {{a black and white}} drawing of the arms. No size specifications have been laid out for the coat of arms except for when it is used on the national flag.|$|E
5|$|Strobilomyces strobilaceus {{is roughly}} similar in {{appearance}} {{because of its}} rough scaly cap and lacerated margin, but may be distinguished from B.ananas by smooth stem without a ring, different spores, and flesh that is less tough. The Australian species Boletellus ananiceps has spores with narrow longitudinal ribs {{that do not have}} cross-striae. B.dissiliens has <b>colors</b> <b>that</b> are not red as in B.ananas, and pores that can become reddish in maturity. Further, the cap flesh of B.dissiliens turns blue upon exposure to air.|$|E
5|$|The Inuit group {{includes}} five prograde outer moons {{that are similar}} enough in their distances from the planet (186–297 radii of Saturn), their orbital inclinations (45–50°) and their <b>colors</b> <b>that</b> they {{can be considered a}} group. The moons are Ijiraq, Kiviuq, Paaliaq, Siarnaq, and Tarqeq. The largest among them is Siarnaq with an estimated size of about 40km.|$|E

5|$|Back at school, Skinner's {{dress code}} demoralizes the {{students}} until a rainstorm soaks through the uniforms, causing the grey color {{to be washed}} out, revealing tie-dye <b>colors</b> <b>that</b> make the playful spirit of the children return. At the bowling alley, before the championship game begins, Burns gives the team new shirts. Two pins away from victory, Burns takes his turn. Otto tips over a vending machine and the vibrations help the Pin Pals win by knocking down the pins. As the team celebrates their win, Burns takes the trophy and keeps it for himself. Cheered on by his teammates, Homer attempts {{to break into the}} mansion and recover the trophy; however, this ends disastrously when the hounds are released and catch Homer {{a few feet from the}} gate, mauling him severely.|$|E
5|$|White-and-red flags {{were first}} waved during a {{patriotic}} demonstration on May 3, 1916 in Warsaw. The organizing committee advised participants about the correct {{alignment of the}} <b>colors,</b> <b>that</b> is with the white stripe above the red one. Still, many demonstrators brought flags with the red stripe on top. On August 1, 1919, almost a year after Poland regained independence in November 1918, the Sejm officially introduced a white-and-red bicolor as the Polish national flag. In order to avoid confusion with the white-and-red maritime signal flag used internationally by harbor pilots and tugboats, the same act of Sejm introduced {{a variant of the}} flag with the coat of arms in the white stripe for use as a civil ensign and by Polish diplomats and consuls abroad.|$|E
5|$|The outdoor {{scene in}} which Xander sees Buffy in the sandbox was {{intentionally}} overexposed, intensifying the foreground and blowing out the background, making the sky look white; flash frames were also used in the shot of Buffy in the desert. Whedon allowed some shots to last far longer than is common in a television episode; this cinematic technique allowed the images to take on meaning. Highly stylized lighting is used throughout Xander's dream. In the university hallway the scene is lit with green and orange gels, while the almost shot-for-shot re-creation of the Apocalypse Now section is lit with carefully controlled spotlights which allow the background to fall out to black. Whedon cites The Limey as an inspiration for the unnaturally colored university sequence, and had the scene from Apocalypse Now playing on tape during filming to ensure as close a match as possible for that sequence. When Xander is driving the ice cream truck with Anya, the backgrounds outside the car intentionally look fake, to {{give a sense of}} stillness where there should be motion. Whedon originally wanted to use rear-screen projection for the driving scene, but had to utilize greenscreen instead, as rear-screen projection would be difficult to set up on their stages. Some special effects shots came about by accident; in his commentary Whedon explains that when Buffy smeared the mud all over her face, it looked as though she was giving herself a facial. He therefore dissolved the shot into a negative image, creating intense <b>colors</b> <b>that</b> made the shot more interesting.|$|E

25|$|If one chooses any {{two points}} of {{color on the}} {{chromaticity}} diagram, then all the <b>colors</b> <b>that</b> lie {{in a straight line}} between the two points can be formed by mixing these two colors. It follows that the gamut of colors must be convex in shape. All <b>colors</b> <b>that</b> can be formed by mixing three sources are found inside the triangle formed by the source points on the chromaticity diagram (and so on for multiple sources).|$|E

25|$|Reptiles and {{amphibians}} {{also have}} four cone types (occasionally five), and probably {{see at least}} {{the same number of}} <b>colors</b> <b>that</b> humans do, or perhaps more. In addition, some nocturnal geckos have the capability of seeing color in dim light.|$|E

25|$|By 1913 the predominate {{tendency}} in modern art visible at the Salon d'Automne consisted of Cubism {{with a clear}} tendency towards abstraction. The trend to use brighter <b>colors</b> <b>that</b> had already begun in 1911 continued through 1912 and 1913. This exhibition, held from 15 November to 8 January 1914, was dominated by de La Fresnaye, Gleizes and Picabia. Works by Delaunay, Duchamp and Léger were not exhibited.|$|E
