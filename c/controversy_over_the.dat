Developments within that <b>controversy</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> next several years shaped her evolving philosophy on women’s rights.|$|E

5|$|Retrograde {{signaling}} {{is currently}} a contentious subject as some investigators {{do not believe the}} presynaptic cell contributes at all to the expression of LTP. Even among proponents of the hypothesis there is <b>controversy</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> identity of the messenger. Early thoughts focused on nitric oxide, while most recent evidence points to cell adhesion proteins.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} seasonality {{may also}} be due to social factors, such as people spending more time indoors, near infected people, and specifically children at school. There is some <b>controversy</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> role of low body temperature as {{a risk factor for}} the common cold; the majority of the evidence suggests that it may result in greater susceptibility to infection.|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} before the {{beginning}} of the race, there was <b>controversy</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> first stage. On arriving at the start, the teams discovered that the route used a variety of road surfaces, crossed sandy sections and included several ramps. As a result, the race organisers decided to neutralise the stage: the teams therefore competed only for the stage victory and for the team classification, not for the general classification.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{eventually}} {{negotiated a}} deal to produce Radioland Murders for Universal shortly after the successful release of American Graffiti in late 1973. Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz prepared a rough draft based on Lucas's 1974 film treatment, and Universal was confident enough to announce pre-production soon after. Lucas was set to direct with Gary Kurtz producing. In the original Huyck/Katz script, Roger and Penny were not a married couple seeking divorce, but were boyfriend and girlfriend with a love-hate relationship. Their script also included the <b>controversy</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> invention of radio.|$|E
5|$|Never Say Never Again had {{its origins}} in the early 1960s {{following}} the <b>controversy</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> 1961 Thunderball novel, which led to Kevin McClory becoming producer of the Eon Productions film of the same name.

5|$|The Apache was {{a valued}} form of {{close air support}} in the {{conflict}} in Afghanistan, being deployed to the region in 2006. The Apache has been an object of <b>controversy</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> fitting of some weapons, such as cluster munitions. Naval trials and temporary deployments at sea have proven the aircraft as an able platform to operate from the decks of ships, which is a unique application of the Apache amongst its operators. British Apaches served in the NATO 2011 military intervention in Libya operating from Royal Navy ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{event has}} also been commemorated through {{references}} in television, theatre, and popular music. A play about the shootings by Adam Kelly called The Anorak was named {{as one of the}} best plays of 2004 by the Montreal Gazette.

5|$|The formal <b>controversy</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{legality}} of the annexation of Texas {{stems from the fact}} that Congress approved the annexation of Texas as a state, rather than a territory, with simple majorities in each house, instead of annexing the land by Senate treaty, as was done with Native American lands. Tyler's extralegal joint resolution maneuver in 1844 exceeded strict constructionist precepts, but was passed by Congress in 1845 as part of a compromise bill. The success of the joint house Texas annexation set a precedent that would be applied to Hawaii's annexation in 1897.|$|E

5|$|The {{health risks}} {{associated}} with nuclear materials have also featured prominently in Australian anti-nuclear campaigns. This {{has been the case}} worldwide because of accidents like the Chernobyl disaster, but Australian concerns have also involved specific local factors such as <b>controversy</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> health effects of nuclear testing in Australia and the South Pacific, and the emergence of prominent anti-nuclear campaigners Helen Caldicott and Tilman Ruff, who are medical practitioners.|$|E
5|$|There was <b>controversy</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{high cost}} of the line as a whole. The project was divided up into four phases, in part, to {{maximize}} {{the ability of the}} project to receive funding from the Federal Government as part of the Department of Transportation's New Starts Program.

5|$|Wank Week was a {{controversial}} season of television programming that {{was due to}} be broadcast in the United Kingdom by Channel 4, expected to consist {{of a series of}} three documentary programmes about masturbation. However, plans to broadcast it in March 2007 came under public attack from senior television figures, and the planned broadcasts were pulled amid claims of declining editorial standards and <b>controversy</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> channel's public service broadcasting credentials. While Wank Week itself was cancelled, the films it was meant to showcase may yet be broadcast by the channel at a later date.|$|E

5|$|While the Spruce Production Division {{was quickly}} demobilized after the war, {{there was some}} post-war <b>controversy</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> cost of its operations. Disque, by then a brigadier general, spent months {{answering}} to charges that his division had wasted taxpayers' money. Congress was particularly critical of the $4million spent on an unfinished railroad located in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington.

5|$|Zwingli's {{views on}} baptism are largely rooted in his {{conflict}} with the Anabaptists, a group whose beliefs included the rejection of infant baptism and centered on the leadership of Conrad Grebel and Felix Manz. In October 1523, the <b>controversy</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> issue broke out during the second Zürich disputation and Zwingli vigorously defended the need for infant baptism and his belief that rebaptism was unnecessary. His major works on the subject include Baptism, Rebaptism, and Infant Baptism (1525), A Reply to Hubmaier (1525), A Refutation (1527), and Questions Concerning the Sacrament of Baptism (1530).|$|E

Executing a bicycle kick in a competitive football match, particularly in scoring a goal, usually garners wide attention in the sports media. The bicycle kick has been featured in works of art, such as sculptures, films, advertisements, and literature. The manoeuvre is also used in other similar ball sports, particularly in the variants of association football like futsal and beach soccer. The <b>controversy</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> move's invention and name in Brazil, Chile, and Peru (and its status as an element of the notable Chile–Peru football rivalry) has added to the kick's acclaim in popular culture.|$|E
