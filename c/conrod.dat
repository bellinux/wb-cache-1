2500|$|A crank is an arm {{attached}} at a {{right angle}} to a rotating shaft [...] by which reciprocating motion is imparted to or received from the shaft. It is used to convert circular motion into reciprocating motion, or vice versa. The arm may be a bent portion of the shaft, or a separate arm or disk attached to it. [...] Attached {{to the end of}} the crank by a pivot is a rod, usually called a connecting rod (<b>conrod).</b> [...] The end of the rod attached to the crank moves in a circular motion, while the other end is usually constrained to move in a linear sliding motion.|$|E
2500|$|A {{favourite}} {{event of}} Hulme's was the Bathurst 1000, {{held at the}} famous Mount Panorama track in Australia. In the 1992 event he was driving a semi-works supported BMW M3 for Benson & Hedges Racing when after complaining over the car-to-pits radio of blurred vision (originally thought to be because of the heavy rain) Hulme suffered a massive heart attack at the wheel whilst driving along the high-speed <b>Conrod</b> Straight. After veering into the wall {{on the left side}} of the track at about , he managed to bring the car to a relatively controlled stop sliding against the safety railing and concrete wall on the right side of the track. When marshals reached the scene, they found Hulme still strapped in. [...] He was taken from the car straight to Bathurst Hospital where he was officially pronounced dead.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} between the two equations is the effect of <b>conrod</b> tilting angle that lowers the smallend position whenever it is not at TDC or BDC. This means the imbalance is proportional to the ratio of <b>conrod</b> length to stroke, i.e. the longer the <b>conrod</b> in relation to stroke, the less this imbalance becomes. Also, inertia force is created not by a steady speed, but by acceleration and deceleration of mass movement, so the strength is proportional to the square of crankshaft rotational speed, making the imbalance particularly speed sensitive.|$|E
50|$|Pistons {{were to be}} cast aluminum. Compression {{ratio was}} {{targeted}} as 10.5:1; on the surviving engine, it was measured at 9.8:1. Forged <b>conrods</b> used the Wedge's 3/8 in hardware, {{as opposed to the}} Hemi's 7/16 in, but would nonetheless have been considered high-performance parts.|$|R
50|$|The {{business}} field of Hatz Components produces high precision engine and drive {{elements such as}} <b>conrods,</b> crankshafts, casings and rotating and control parts for engine manufacturers throughout the world. The focus here is on commercial vehicle, automobile, motorcycle, agriculture and printing machine industries {{as well as the}} branches of racing and energy generation.In the production of <b>conrods,</b> starting from 1-cylinder engines up to heavy duty 12-cylinder applications, all conrod-specific requirements across all segments are mastered. In addition to form, oval and deep hole drilling, this also includes the crack technology as well as separation cut and profile toothing. The machining of high-strength, micro-alloyed steels, aluminium, cast iron, sintered materials is self-evident and is rounded off in particular by the machining of titanium.|$|R

5000|$|Formerly {{known as}} Main Straight, <b>Conrod</b> Straight was {{so named because}} of a con-rod failure that ended the 1939 Easter race of Frank Kleinig in his Kleinig/Hudson racecar. At 1.916 km, <b>Conrod</b> Straight is the fastest section of Mount Panorama, with V8 Supercars almost {{reaching}} 300 km/h. The straight is a roller-coaster ride featuring two distinct crests, the second of which was rebuilt in 1987. <b>Conrod</b> Straight has been the scene of {{five of the six}} car racing deaths on the circuit - Bevan Gibson, Tom Sulman, Mike Burgmann, Denny Hulme and Don Watson. All except [...] Formula One World Champion Denny Hulme (heart attack) died in high-speed accidents. However, the chicane introduced into <b>Conrod</b> Straight reduced the top speed of cars going down the straight and has created one of the fastest corners in the world. Most drivers arrive at the initial part of the chicane at over 290 km/h. Prior to the introduction of The Chase in 1987, <b>Conrod</b> Straight was a mile-long straight where the faster cars were getting airborne over the second hump, which was a contributing factor in Burgmann's accident.|$|E

50|$|The 4-litre Barra Inline 6 engine {{from the}} Ford Falcon, uses a 92.21 mm bore and 99.31 mm stroke, which equates to a 0.929:1 bore-stroke ratio. Although {{considered}} a performance engine, its proportionally weak valve springs, pistons and <b>conrods</b> cause {{the engine to}} redline at 6000 rpm.|$|R
5000|$|Liberman and Arrington made a {{deal with}} Pontiac to supply Drarare hemis (remnants of Mickey Thompson's gas dragster program). Brutus was {{sponsored}} by Larry Hopkins Pontiac in Sunnyvale, California, and Goodies Speed Shop, and ran a 6-71 Jimmy blower, Venolia pistons, Crane cam, and Mondello <b>conrods.</b>|$|R
50|$|A compact {{two-cylinder}} engine, the 2G30 (max. power 15 kW; engine speed: 3000 rpm; weight: 85 kg) {{was introduced}} in 1986. Two years later, Hatz began with contract-manufacturing of automotive components like <b>conrods,</b> crankshafts, rocker arms, etc. Today, several million parts are produced for the automotive, agricultural and motorcycle industry.|$|R

50|$|Honda {{released}} the NR750 in 1992. The bike had a 750 cc V4 with oval pistons, utilising 8 valves per cylinder and 2 <b>conrods</b> per piston; the design allowed {{the engine to}} meet FIM racing regulations {{limiting the number of}} cylinders to 4, while providing the valve area (and therefore increased efficiency) of a V8.|$|R
50|$|The R7 {{was built}} for racing 'out of the box', implied by the chassis, which was derived from {{information}} and geometry from the YZR500 machines of the period. The R7 was specified with Öhlins suspension components and with titanium valves, titanium <b>conrods,</b> a shortened Deltabox II frame and dry weight of just 416 lb.|$|R
50|$|Twisting {{forces on}} {{crankshaft}} cannot be avoided because <b>conrods</b> are normally located at a (often different) distance(s) {{to the power}} take-off plane (e.g. clutch surface) {{on the length of}} the crankshaft. The twisting vibrations caused by these (7.Torsional imbalance) forces normally cannot be felt outside of an engine, but are major causes of crankshaft failure.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Conrod</b> Settlement [...] is a rural {{community}} of the Halifax Regional Municipality in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{inherently}} little damping in a crankshaft {{to reduce the}} vibration except for the shearing resistance of oil film in the main and <b>conrod</b> bearings.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, {{the circuit}} hosted the IGSA Gravity Sports World Championships: {{skateboard}} downhill and street luge downhill. The race began at Skyline and ended at <b>Conrod</b> Straight.|$|E
50|$|Visually the VK Group A SS had the {{addition}} of a rear spoiler, larger front air dam and a more aggressive front grill over the standard VK Commodore. Other changes included a double row timing chain (eliminating the car's inherent weakness of 1985, a single row chain), as well as stronger <b>conrods</b> and suspension mountings.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, a [...] "Technical Update" [...] {{was applied}} to the N63, {{resulting}} in the N63TU variants (also known as N63B44O1). The main upgrade was the addition of Valvetronic. Other changes include revised turbochargers, removal of the blowoff valve, lighter pistons, forged <b>conrods</b> and crankshaft, addition of an oil catch can system, revised fuel system and addition of a second coolant pump.|$|R
5000|$|... 16. Plane balance - e.g. Compression on a boxer {{twin engine}} occurs at {{different}} planes on the crankshaft at different distances to clutch surface. A single plane (single row) radial engine {{does not have}} this plane imbalance except for a short mismatch between the power generating plane where the <b>conrods</b> are, and the power take off plane where the propeller is.|$|R

5000|$|All Bees {{with the}} {{exception}} of the Killer Bee and Venom had the same crankshaft that was only good for about 20,000 rpm before the <b>conrod</b> pin would break off.|$|E
5000|$|As a comparison, the VK Commodores {{run by the}} HDT at the 1984 James Hardie 1000 {{under the}} old Group C {{regulations}} (which saw the cars have much larger wheels and large aerodynamic spoilers front and back) produced over [...] and were recorded at 275 km/h on the 2 km long <b>Conrod</b> Straight. The near standard 1985 Group A race cars only produced around [...] and were recorded at 252 km/h on <b>Conrod.</b> This difference was also reflected in lap times with Peter Brock's fastest 1985 qualifying time being 8.811 seconds slower {{than he was in}} 1984.|$|E
50|$|The eight {{full-time}} {{teams from}} 2011 continued into 2012, {{with an additional}} ninth team, Caudwell Racing from South Africa, entered. Their entry was officially confirmed in June 2011, making history by introducing four-stroke engines into the series which had been dominated in recent times by the two-stroke Mercury engines. The revolutionary engine {{was based on an}} Infiniti road car engine and featured Cosworth pistons and <b>conrods</b> in its design.|$|R
50|$|This {{secondary}} balance {{advantage is}} beneficial {{for making the}} engine compact, for there is not as much need for longer <b>conrods,</b> {{which is one of}} the reasons for the popularity of modern and smooth turbo-charged inline 3 cylinder engines on compact cars. However, the crankshaft with heavy counterweights tend to make it difficult for the engine to be made sporty (i.e. quick revving up and down) because of the strong flywheel effect.|$|R
5000|$|To {{achieve the}} power required, Chapman {{commissioned}} Harry Mundy (of BRM V16 fame) {{to design a}} dual overhead camshaft (DOHC) conversion. This comprised an aluminium cylinder head and an aluminium front cover and its back plate assembly containing the water pump and the camshaft drive chain. However, the 5 main bearing [...] version for Consul Capri became available in time for production, and the design was converted on this 116E block, crankshaft and 125E Type C <b>conrods.</b>|$|R
