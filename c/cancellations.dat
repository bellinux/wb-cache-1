So, {{it is impossible to}} receive transmit data of distant station. but we confirm {{that it is possible to}} receive transmit data of distant station by digital <b>cancellation</b> with frame structure.

In particular, we consider passive suppression due to antenna separation {{at the same}} node, and active <b>cancellation</b> in analog and/or digital domain. First, we show that the average amount of <b>cancellation</b> increases for active <b>cancellation</b> techniques as the received self-interference power increases. Our characterization of the average <b>cancellation</b> {{as a function of}} the self-interference power allows us to show that for a constant signal-to-interference ratio at the receiver antenna (before any active <b>cancellation</b> is applied), the rate of a full-duplex link increases as the self-interference power increases. Second, we show that applying digital <b>cancellation</b> after analog <b>cancellation</b> can sometimes increase the self-interference, and thus digital <b>cancellation</b> is more effective when applied selectively based on measured suppression values. Third, we complete our study of the impact of self-interference <b>cancellation</b> mechanisms by characterizing the probability distribution of the self-interference channel before and after <b>cancellation.</b> Comment: Revised the submission to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, May 2012.

30|$|It is {{important}} to note that the two types of cancellability rely on two types of <b>cancellation</b> which are called explicit and contextual <b>cancellation.</b> In a sense, these two types of <b>cancellation</b> are rather different. While explicit <b>cancellation</b> pertains to a particular utterance context, contextual <b>cancellation</b> refers to a sentence uttered and the meanings that can be communicated with it in different utterance contexts. Accordingly, Jaszczolt maintains that explicit <b>cancellation</b> is an empirically verifiable phenomenon, whereas contextual <b>cancellation</b> is just a kind of thought experiment (see Jaszczolt 2009 : 261). However, in what follows I argue that this view on the two types of <b>cancellation</b> is highly misleading and that both of them should be considered thought experiments: either we have to imagine a <b>cancellation</b> clause which cancels the implicature, or we have to imagine an utterance context in which the utterance does not give rise to the implicature. 2 This view on explicit and contextual <b>cancellation</b> accounts for the fact that both are part of the Gricean cancellability test which is nothing else than one of several diagnostic tools used to distinguish between conventional and conversational implicatures.|$|R
