5|$|In October 1984, Gardner killed Melvyn John Otterstrom {{during a}} robbery in Salt Lake City. While being moved in April 1985 {{to a court}} hearing for the homicide, he fatally shot {{attorney}} Michael Burdell in an unsuccessful escape attempt. Convicted of two counts of murder, Gardner {{was sentenced to life}} imprisonment for the first count and received the death penalty for the second. The state adopted more stringent security measures {{as a result of the}} incident at the courthouse. While held at Utah State Prison, Gardner was charged with another <b>capital</b> <b>crime</b> for stabbing an inmate in 1994. However, that charge was thrown out by the Utah Supreme Court because the victim survived.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{theology}} espoused by their religious leaders, {{the people of}} Plymouth Colony had a strong belief in the supernatural. Richard Greenham was a Puritan theologian whose works were known to the Plymouth residents, and he counseled extensively against turning to magic or wizardry to solve problems. The Pilgrims saw Satan's work in nearly every calamity that befell them; the dark magical arts were very real and present for them. They believed {{in the presence of}} malevolent spirits who brought misfortune to people. For example, in 1660, a court inquest into the drowning death of Jeremiah Burroughs determined that a possessed canoe was to blame. Massachusetts Bay Colony experienced an outbreak of witchcraft scares in the 17th century, but {{there is little evidence that}} Plymouth was engulfed in anything similar. Witchcraft was listed as a <b>capital</b> <b>crime</b> in the 1636 codification of the laws by the Plymouth General Court, but there were no actual convictions of witches in Plymouth Colony. The court records only show two formal accusations of witchcraft. The first, of Goodwife Holmes in 1661, never went to trial. The second, of Mary Ingram in 1677, resulted in trial and acquittal.|$|E
5|$|From late Medieval Scotland {{there is}} {{evidence}} of occasional prosecutions of individuals for causing harm through witchcraft, but these may have been declining {{in the first half of}} the sixteenth century. In the aftermath of the initial Reformation settlement, Parliament passed the Witchcraft Act 1563, similar to that passed in England one year earlier, which made witchcraft a <b>capital</b> <b>crime.</b> Despite the fact that Scotland probably had about one quarter of the population of England, it had three times the number of witchcraft prosecutions, at about 6,000 for the entire period. James VI's visit to Denmark, a country familiar with witch hunts, may have encouraged an interest in the study of witchcraft. After his return to Scotland, he attended the North Berwick witch trials, the first major persecution of witches in Scotland under the 1563 Act. Several people, most notably Agnes Sampson, were convicted of using witchcraft to send storms against James' ship. James became obsessed with the threat posed by witches and, inspired by his personal involvement, in 1597 wrote the Daemonologie, a tract that opposed the practice of witchcraft and which provided background material for Shakespeare's Tragedy of Macbeth. James is known to have personally supervised the torture of women accused of being witches. After 1599, his views became more sceptical.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} people counted in the census of 1381 was 59,873,305; however, this number dropped {{significantly}} when the government found that some 3 million people were missing from the tax census of 1391. Even though underreporting figures was made a <b>capital</b> <b>crime</b> in 1381, the need for survival pushed many to abandon the tax registration and wander from their region, where Hongwu had attempted to impose rigid immobility on the populace. The government tried to mitigate this by creating their own conservative estimate of 60,545,812 people in 1393. In his Studies on the Population of China, Ho Ping-ti suggests revising the 1393 census to 65 million people, noting that large areas of North China and frontier areas were not counted in that census. Brook states that the population figures gathered in the official censuses after 1393 ranged between 51 and 62 million, while the population was in fact increasing. Even the Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1487–505) remarked that the daily increase in subjects coincided with the daily dwindling amount of registered civilians and soldiers. William Atwell states that around 1400 the population of China was perhaps 90 million people, citing Heijdra and Mote.|$|E
25|$|The {{penalty is}} life imprisonment, except for conspiracy, {{for which the}} maximum {{sentence}} is 14 years imprisonment.

25|$|North Carolina {{had also}} enacted a {{mandatory}} {{death penalty for}} first-degree rape, but the Court later ruled in Coker v.

25|$|In 1869, An Dehai, a court eunuch {{and close}} aide of Empress Dowager Cixi, {{was arrested and}} {{executed}} in Shandong Province by Ding Baozhen, the provincial governor. This was {{because it was a}} <b>capital</b> <b>crime</b> for eunuchs to travel out of the Forbidden City without authorisation. The empress dowager became more suspicious of Prince Gong because she believed that he instigated Ding Baozhen to execute An Dehai.|$|E
25|$|In western {{classical}} antiquity, theism was {{the fundamental}} belief {{that supported the}} legitimacy of the state (the polis, later the Roman Empire). Historically, any person who did not believe in any deity supported by the state was fair game to accusations of atheism, a <b>capital</b> <b>crime.</b> For political reasons, Socrates in Athens (399 BCE) was accused of being atheos ("refusing to acknowledge the gods recognized by the state").|$|E

25|$|Treason, espionage and {{large-scale}} drug trafficking are all capital crimes under federal law. Treason is also punishable by death in six states (Arkansas, California, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Missouri). Vermont {{still has a}} pre-Furman statute providing {{the death penalty for}} treason despite removing capital punishment for murder in 1965. Large-scale drug trafficking is punishable by death in two states (Florida and Missouri). Aircraft hijacking is a <b>capital</b> <b>crime</b> in Georgia and Mississippi.|$|E
25|$|Roman law {{recognized}} rape as a {{crime in}} which the victim bore no guilt and a <b>capital</b> <b>crime.</b> The rape of a woman was considered an attack on her family and father's honour, and rape victims were shamed for allowing the bad name in her father's honour. As a matter of law, rape could be committed only against a citizen in good standing. The rape of a slave could be prosecuted only as damage to her owner's property.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, the {{distinction}} between religious homophobia and state-sponsored homophobia is not clear, a key example being territories under Islamic authority. All major Islamic sects forbid homosexuality, which is a crime under Sharia Law and treated as such in most Muslim countries. In Afghanistan, for instance, homosexuality carried the death penalty under the Taliban. After their fall, homosexuality was reduced from a <b>capital</b> <b>crime</b> to one that is punished with fines and prison sentences. The legal situation in the United Arab Emirates, however, is unclear.|$|E

25|$|Following {{colonisation}} by the British Empire, Australian {{states and}} territories inherited British anti-homosexuality laws {{such as the}} Buggery Act of 1533. These provisions were retained in the criminal laws passed by 19th century colonial parliaments, and subsequently by state parliaments after Federation. Same-sex sexual activity between men was considered a <b>capital</b> <b>crime,</b> resulting in the execution of people convicted of sodomy. Different jurisdictions gradually began to reduce {{the death penalty for}} sodomy to life imprisonment, with Victoria the last to reduce the penalty in 1949.|$|E
25|$|In some states, {{the high}} number of {{aggravating}} factors has been criticized on account of giving prosecutors too much discretion in choosing cases where they believe capital punishment is warranted. In California especially, an official commission proposed, in 2008, to reduce these factors to five (multiple murders, torture murder, murder of a police officer, murder committed in jail, and murder related to another felony). Columnist Charles Lane went further, and proposed that murder related to a felony other than rape should no longer be a <b>capital</b> <b>crime</b> when there is only one victim killed.|$|E
500|$|In the 2008 {{session of}} the Colorado General Assembly, Rice sits on the House Transportation and Energy Committee, and is {{vice-chairman}} of the House Business Affairs and Labor Committee. During the session, Rice has explored introducing legislation to increase vehicle registration fees in order boost transportation funding, and plans on introducing legislation to make aggravated rape of a child under 12 a <b>capital</b> <b>crime,</b> eligible for the death penalty. Rice also introduced legislation to exempt some school fundraisers from sales tax, a measure which he placed on hold pending consideration of a broader measure by Rep. Jerry Sonnenberg. [...] Rice and Sonnenberg ultimately combined their efforts and integrated the two bills, both of which became law.|$|E

500|$|The actual {{efficacy}} of jury consultants {{may not be}} very important because the demographic composition of the jury has {{little effect on the}} verdict it renders, usually causing only a 5%–15% variance in verdicts. The evidence presented at trial has far more impact on what the verdict will be. As Kressel and Kressel indicate, [...] "when the evidence is strong, nothing else matters much" [...] and even when the evidence is ambiguous, demographic characteristics of jurors are a relatively minor influence. Some researchers argue that a significant improvement in jury selection, however small, may be worthwhile when the stakes are high, like for a defendant accused of a <b>capital</b> <b>crime</b> or a corporation that stands to lose millions of dollars in a civil suit.|$|E
500|$|The Commission {{recommended}} various changes. On {{the criminal}} law side, they supported reducing {{the use of the}} death penalty, although [...] "wilful murderers" [...] were still to be executed, and the abduction of a child under 16 was to be considered a <b>capital</b> <b>crime.</b> They also suggested allowing prisoners access to lawyers in any case where the prosecution was permitted representation and allowing witnesses for the defence to give evidence under oath. Legal aid was also considered, although the rejection of a case where legal aid was given would result in the defendant being sent to a workhouse for a month and whipped. The abolition of peine forte et dure as a way to avoid the forfeiture of land was also proposed.|$|E
500|$|The dissenters {{acknowledged}} that other children of foreigners—including former slaves—had, over the years, acquired U.S. citizenship through birth on U.S. soil. But they still saw {{a difference between}} those people and U.S.-born individuals of Chinese ancestry, because of strong cultural traditions discouraging Chinese immigrants from assimilating into mainstream American society, Chinese laws of the time which made renouncing allegiance to the Chinese emperor a <b>capital</b> <b>crime,</b> and {{the provisions of the}} Chinese Exclusion Act making Chinese immigrants already in the United States ineligible for citizenship. The question for the dissenters was [...] "not whether [...] was born in the U.S. or subject to the jurisdiction thereof ... but whether his or her parents have the ability, under U.S. or foreign law, statutory or treaty-based, to become citizens of the U.S. themselves".|$|E
