40|$|<b>CALM</b> (clathrin {{assembly}} lymphoid {{myeloid leukemia}} protein) is a cargo-selective adaptor for the post-Golgi R-SNAREs VAMPs 2, 3, and 8, {{and it also}} regulates the size of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles at the plasma membrane. The present study has two objectives: to determine whether <b>CALM</b> can sort additional VAMPs, and to investigate whether VAMP sorting contributes to CALM-dependent vesicle size regulation. Using a flow cytometry-based endocytosis efficiency assay, we demonstrate that <b>CALM</b> is also able to sort VAMPs 4 and 7, {{even though they have}} sorting signals for other clathrin adaptors. <b>CALM</b> homologues are present in nearly every eukaryote, suggesting that the <b>CALM</b> family may have evolved as adaptors for retrieving all post-Golgi VAMPs from the plasma membrane. Using a knockdown/rescue system, we show that wild-type <b>CALM</b> restores normal VAMP sorting in CALM-depleted cells, but that two non-VAMP-binding mutants do not. However, when we assayed the effect of <b>CALM</b> depletion on coated pit morphology, using a fluorescence microscopy-based assay, we found that the two mutants were as effective as wild-type <b>CALM.</b> Thus, we can uncouple the sorting function of <b>CALM</b> from its structural role...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} <b>CALM,</b> {{a method for}} building statistical language models for the Web. <b>CALM</b> addresses several unique challenges dealing with the Web contents. First, <b>CALM</b> does not rely on the whole corpus {{to be available to}} build the language model. Instead, we design <b>CALM</b> to progressively adapt itself as Web chunks are made available by the crawler. Second, given the dynamic and dramatic changes in the Web contents, <b>CALM</b> is designed to quickly enrich its lexicon and N-grams as new vocabulary and phrases are discovered. To reduce the amount of heuristics and human interventions typically needed for model adaptation, we derive an information theoretical formula for <b>CALM</b> to facilitate the optimal adaptation in the maximum a posteriori (MAP) sense. Testing against a collection of Web chunks where new vocabulary and phrases are dominant, we show <b>CALM</b> can achieve comparable and satisfactory model measured in perplexity. We also show <b>CALM</b> is robust against over training and the initial condition, suggesting that any assumptions made in obtaining the initial model can gradually see their impacts diminished as <b>CALM</b> runs its full course and adapt to more data...|$|R

40|$|<b>CALM</b> is {{implicated in}} the {{formation}} of clathrin-coated vesicles, which mediate endocytosis and intracellular trafficking of growth factor receptors and nutrients. We previously found that CALM-deficient mice suffer from severe anemia due to the impaired clathrin-mediated endocytosis of transferrin receptor in immature erythroblast. However, <b>CALM</b> has been supposed to regulate the growth and survival of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. So, in this study, we focused on the function of <b>CALM</b> in these cells. We here show that the number of Linage 2 Sca- 1 +KIT+ (LSK) cells decreased in the fetal liver of <b>CALM</b> 2 / 2 mice. Also, colony forming activity was impaired in <b>CALM</b> 2 / 2 LSK cells. In addition, SCF, FLT 3, and TPO-dependent growth was severely impaired in <b>CALM</b> 2 / 2 LSK cells, while they can normally proliferate in response to IL- 3 and IL- 6. We also examined the intracellular trafficking of KIT using <b>CALM</b> 2 / 2 murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) engineered to express KIT. At first, we confirmed that endocytosis of SCF-bound KIT was not impaired in <b>CALM</b> 2 / 2 MEFs by the internalization assay. However, SCF-induced KIT trafficking from early to late endosome was severely impaired in <b>CALM</b> 2 / 2 MEFs. As a result, although intracellular KIT disappeared 30 min after SCF stimulation in wild-type (WT) MEFs, it was retained in <b>CALM</b> 2 / 2 MEFs. Furthermore, SCF-induced phosphorylation of cytosolic KIT was enhanced and prolonged in <b>CALM</b> 2 / 2 MEFs compared with that in WT MEFs, leading to the excessive activation of Akt.

The first two roundabouts were installed by NYSDOT even though both the town and city of Poughkeepsie declared that they were opposed to the roundabouts. Additionally, the roundabouts have drawn much controversy from local residents because they remove a lane of traffic in each direction, reducing Raymond Avenue (NY376) from a four-lane road to a divided two-lane boulevard and significantly altering pre-existing traffic patterns. A moderate amount of traffic has diverted onto alternate local routes as a result. In response, NYSDOT installed traffic <b>calming</b> measures on these parallel roads prior to the {{construction of}} the Fulton Avenue roundabout.|$|E

40|$|Chronic {{stress is}} {{associated}} with negative health outcomes and is linked with neuroendocrine changes, deleterious effects on innate and adaptive immunity, and central nervous system neuropathology. Although stress management is commonly advocated clinically, there is insufficient mechanistic understanding of how decreasing stress affects disease pathogenesis. Therefore, we have developed a "calm mouse model" with caging enhancements designed to reduce murine stress. Male BALB/c mice were divided into four groups: control (Cntl), standard caging; <b>calm</b> (<b>Calm),</b> large caging to reduce animal density, a cardboard nest box for shelter, paper nesting material to promote innate nesting behavior, and a polycarbonate tube to mimic tunneling; control exercise (Cntl Ex), standard caging with a running wheel, known to reduce stress; and <b>calm</b> exercise (<b>Calm</b> Ex), <b>calm</b> caging with a running wheel. <b>Calm,</b> Cntl Ex and <b>Calm</b> Ex animals exhibited significantly less corticosterone production than Cntl animals. We also observed changes in spleen mass, and in vitro splenocyte studies demonstrated that <b>Calm</b> Ex animals had innate and adaptive immune responses that were more sensitive to acute handling stress than those in Cntl. <b>Calm</b> animals gained greater body mass than Cntl, although they had similar food intake: and we also observed changes in body composition, using magnetic resonance imaging. Together, our {{results suggest that the}} <b>Calm</b> mouse model represents a promising approach to studying the biological effects of stress reduction in the context of health and in conjunction with existing disease models.
