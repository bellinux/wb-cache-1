40|$|Reducing energy {{consumption}} of <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> systems {{is important in}} order to reduce human environmental footprint. The need to save energy becomes even greater when considering an electric car, since heavy use of the <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> system may exhaust the battery. In this paper we consider a method for an automated agent to provide advice to drivers which will motivate them to reduce the {{energy consumption}} of their <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> unit. Our approach takes into account both the energy consumption of the <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> system and the expected comfort level of the driver. We therefore build two models, one for assessing the energy consumption of the <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> system {{as a function of the}} system’s settings, and the other, models human comfort level as a function of the <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> system’s settings. Using these models, the agent provides advice to the driver considering how to set the <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> system. The agent advises settings which try to preserve a high level of comfort while consuming as little energy as possible. We empirically show that drivers equipped with our agent which provides them with advice significantly save energy as compared to drivers not equipped with our agent...|$|R
40|$|Following a {{hot or cold}} thermal soak, vehicle <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> systems (air {{conditioning}} or heat) {{are required}} to quickly attain a cabin temperature comfortable to the vehicle occupants. In a plug-in hybrid electric or electric vehicle (PEV) equipped with electric <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> systems, the traction battery is the sole on-board power source. Depleting the battery for immediate <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> results in reduced charge-depleting (CD) range and additional battery wear. PEV cabin and battery thermal preconditioning using off-board power supplied by the grid or a building can mitigate the impacts of <b>climate</b> <b>control.</b> This analysis shows that <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> loads can reduce CD range up to 35 %. However, cabin thermal preconditioning can increase CD range up to 19 % when compared to no thermal preconditioning. In addition, this analysis shows that while battery capacity loss over time is driven by ambient temperature rather than <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> loads, concurrent battery thermal preconditioning can reduce capacity loss up to 7 % by reducing pack temperature in a high ambient temperature scenario...|$|R

25|$|The Minnesota Golden Gophers {{football}} program began playing in Metrodome for the 1982 season. Attendance {{was expected to}} increase over the old Memorial Stadium attendance, especially for late fall games, due to the <b>climate</b> <b>controlled</b> comfort. Initially, average attendance had increased over previous seasons at Memorial Stadium. But, the venue {{was removed from the}} traditional on-campus football atmosphere if fans wanted to attend a Gophers football game. Students had to take a bus from the campus to the stadium. The distance from the main campus, along with poor performance by the Gopher football team, caused interest to wane.|$|E

The Imperial featured hidden headlamps behind retractable metal covers {{similar to those}} found on the LeBaron coupe/convertible and New Yorker/Fifth Avenue. The Imperial was available with a choice of several Infinity sound systems, all with a cassette player. Other major options included fully electronic digital instrument cluster with information center, electronically controlled air suspension system, and remote keyless entry with security alarm.

In 1870 the distillery was purchased by Edmund H. Taylor and given its first name, the Old Fire Copper (O.F.C.) Distillery. Taylor sold the distillery eight years later to George T. Stagg along with the Old Oscar Pepper Distillery. This second distillery was sold within the year to James Graham, in order to add more land to the O.F.C. Distillery. In 1886, Stagg installed steam heating in the storage warehouses, the first <b>climate</b> <b>controlled</b> warehouse for aging whiskey in the nation.|$|E
