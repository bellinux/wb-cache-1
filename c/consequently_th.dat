Here we analyzed the immune responses of gene-targeted mice carrying a mutation in the Nlrp 3 gene equivalent to the human mutation associated with Muckle-Wells Syndrome. We found that antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from such mice produced massive amounts of IL- 1 β upon stimulation with microbial stimuli {{in the absence of}} ATP. This was likely due to a diminished inflammasome activation threshold that allowed a response to the small amount of agonist. Moreover, the Nlrp 3 gene-targeted mice exhibited skin inflammation characterized by neutrophil infiltration and a Th 17 cytokine-dominant response, which originated from hematopoietic cells. The inflammation of Nlrp 3 gene-targeted mice resulted from excess IL- 1 β production from APCs, which augmented Th 17 cell differentitation.

Background. Directional coronary atherectomy has been introduced as an alternative technique for balloon angioplasty and may {{reduce the incidence of}} restenosis. Methods. A prospectively collected consecutive series of 87 native coronary artery lesions successfully treated with atherectomy were matched with 87 coronary artery lesions selected from a consecutive series of lesions that had been successfully dilated by balloon angioplasty. Late angiographic analysis was performed in 158 lesions. The net gain index represents the ultimate gain in minimal lumen diameter at follow-up study, normalized for the vessel size. This index {{is the result of the}} relative gain attained during the procedure (the ratio of the change in minimal lumen diameter and reference diameter) and the relative loss observed during the follow-up period (the ratio of the change in minimal lumen diameter during the follow-up period and the reference diameter). Results. Matching for clinical and angiographic variables resulted in two comparable groups with similar baseline stenosis characteristics. Atherectomy resulted in a more pronounced increase in minimal lumen diameter than did balloon angioplasty (mean ± SD 1. 17 ± 0. 29 to 2. 44 ± 0. 42 mm vs. 1. 21 ± 0. 38 to 2. 00 ± 0. 36 mm, p < 0. 001). However, this favorable immediate result was subsequently lost during late angiographic follow-up, so that the minimal lumen diameter at follow-up and the net gain index did not differ significantly between the two groups (1. 76 ± 0. 62 vs. 1. 77 ± 0. 59 nun, p = 0. 93, and 0. 18 ± 0. 19 vs. 0. 17 ± 0. 17, p = 0. 70). <b>Consequently,</b> <b>ths</b> relative gain and relative loss were higher in the atherectomy group. For both techniques, the relative gain was linearly related to the relative loss but the slope of the regression line was steeper for atherectomy, suggesting that the relative loss in the atherectomy group is proportionally even larger for a given relative gain compared with that in the angioplasty group. Conclusions. In matched groups of patients, atherectomy induces a greater initial gain in minimal lumen diameter than does balloon angioplasty. However, the vascular wall injury induced by the device is of a different nature (debulking vs. dilating) that leads to more relative loss over the follow-up period in the atherectomy group...|$|R

Therefore in order to suitable and optimized designing of starter, the essential parameter is taking into account the downstream resistance of system.

To understand how the IL- 18 gene (and <b>consequently</b> <b>Th</b> 1 function) is regulated, we have determined the gene structure and investigated the mechanisms of transcriptional control and cell type expression. The mouse IL- 18 gene comprises seven exons distributed over 26 kb. Exons 1 and 2 of this gene are 5 '-noncoding exons. Promoter activity was detected upstream of these noncoding exons in two distinct regions. Both promoters are TATA-less and not G+C rich. The promoter activity located upstream of exon 2 was shown to act constitutively, while the activity located upstream of exon 1 was up-regulated in activated macrophage and T cell lines. IL- 18 gene expression may be regulated {{in a wide range}} of cell types by the activities of these two distinct promoters.

Ascophyllan induced up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs). Moreover, in vivo administration of ascophyllan promotes up-regulation of CD 40, CD 80, CD 86, MHC class I and MHC class II and production of IL- 6, IL- 12 and TNF-α in spleen cDCs. Interestingly, ascophyllan induced a higher degree of co-stimulatory molecule up-regulation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production than fucoidan, a marine-derived polysaccharide with well-defined effect for promoting DC maturation.

The control of hydrate formation in these and other situations can be guided by moleular level knowledge of the hydrate nucleation process. The nucleation of hydrates is a rare event that occurs in nanoseconds at a random location on a nanometer length scale, and thus a molecular understanding of the process has been difficult to obtain experimentally or by simulation.

The waiting line optimization problem determines the number of service facilities and queue priorities or rules that minimize cost of an operation. Because a company incurs inordinate cost if it has idle servers, and also if it has too many customers (trucks) waiting to be loaded, the optimization problem becomes one of minimizing the total cost to the company.

So, the question that needs to be asked is “How good is Virginia’s water quality, and does it vary across the State? ” The Virginia General Assembly, environmentalists, citizens, and the USEPA have encouraged the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VDEQ) to answer this question. VDEQ answers this question from a compliance perspective through the biennial 305 (b) Report (VDEQ 2002).

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{statistical methods}} and radiation transfer theory methods for cloud detecting {{have a high}} adaptability just only in those areas with a uniform surface coverage and noncomplex terrain. Therefore, adapted to large spatial and temporal scales, in this work a cloud detection method is developed, seeking the main influencing factors of the change of Brightness Temperature(BT) of clear sky and their relationships, researching the change regularity and normal fluctuation range of BT {{on the basis of}} function fitting, setting the cloud detecting dynamic threshold depending on the cloud spectral characteristics, and making accuracy assessment in order to ensure higher adaptability and accuracy of this cloud detecting method. In this paper, a dynamic threshold algorithm is presented for cloud detection using daytime imagery from the VISSR sensor on board FY- 2 C/D/E, which is the first generation geostationary satellite. And the land surface/brightness temperature influence functions are analysis and established, including latitude, longitude, altitude, time, land cover. The theoretical temperature value of clear sky can be calculated through these influence functions. Then, the dynamic threshold cloud detection model is proposed based on the high temporal resolution of VISSR data. Meanwhile, the land surface emissivity is considered as the main factor to the change range of brightness temperature which determines the dynamic threshold for cloud detection. Finally, the dynamic threshold cloud detecting model is evaluated using FY- 2 C/D/E VISSR data covering China, and the Kappa of dynamic method is maximum, equalling 0. 6195, which is much higher than the indexes for the reflectivity and BT fixed methods, equalling 0. 4511 and 0. 403, respectively. <b>Consequently,</b> <b>th...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to analyze the historical personality of A. N. Yakovlev, a former Soviet functionary and ideologist, through his own ideas and reflections, and to deepen the general knowledge about him by using resources {{that have not yet}} been translated to the Czech language. The first chapter briefly presents Yakovlev's life. Furthermore, the thesis highlights the historical events that Yakovlev considered interconnected with the reforms introduced {{in the second half of}} the 1980 's. This refers particularly to certain policy changes implemented by Lenin and, <b>consequently,</b> to 20 <b>th</b> Congress of the Communist Party, revealing personality cult of Stalin. The main emphasis is subsequently placed specifically on this time period associated with the reform of perestroika as Yakovlev is regarded as one of its key authors and proponents...|$|R
40|$|As {{organizations}} {{move into}} the 21 st century, past measures of organizational performance based largely on accounting and financial statements will be insufficient to meaningfully assess value. Short- and long-term performance will be increasingly determined by three resources: ideas, information, and investment capital, of which only investment capital is measured in traditional accounting and financial statements. <b>Consequently,</b> the 20 <b>th</b> century orientation of return on investment needs to be expanded to include and account for both return on ideas and return on information. By focusing on these three measures of ROI the organization {{will be able to}} unleash creativity and obtain a sustainable competitive advantage. In this paper it is suggested that organizations should balance their focus on return on ideas, return on information, and return on investment, a ROI 3 orientation for assessing organizational performance. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The present {{research}} compares properties and behaviour of co-precipitated 3 Y-PSZ powders submitted, after co-precipitation, to different milling treatments. The {{characteristics of the}} different products were evaluated by measurement of particle size distribution, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, specific surface area and scanning electron microscopy analysis. It has been demonstrated that 1 h of attrition milling enables the production of powders with micrometric particles: the dispersing liquid used on milling has little influence. Crystallization of the amorphous powder is achieved after 1 h of high energetic milling, without any thermal treatment. Introduction. Partially stabilized zirconia (PSZ) materials, sintered at high relative density, have high strength and good toughness thanks to the transformation toughening mechanism associated to the zirconia polymorphism [1, 3]. The catalytic properties of PSZ powders are also important since it has been demonstrated {{that they can be}} used for red-ox reactions at moderate temperature [4, 6] and <b>consequently</b> also in <b>th...</b>|$|R
