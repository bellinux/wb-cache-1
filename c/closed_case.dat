50|$|In the law, a <b>close</b> <b>case</b> is {{generally}} {{defined as a}} ruling that could conceivably be decided {{in more than one}} way. Various scholars have attempted to articulate criteria for identifying <b>close</b> <b>cases,</b> and commentators have observed that reliance upon precedent established in <b>close</b> <b>cases</b> leads to the gradual expansion of legal doctrines.|$|R
5000|$|Northwestern University law {{professor}} John E. Coons observed that [...] "under {{a system of}} winner-take-all the one-sided result reached upon principle in the <b>close</b> <b>case</b> must continue to trouble {{the conscience of the}} law". Judge Guido Calabresi, a former dean of Yale Law School, noted that <b>close</b> <b>cases</b> create a [...] "slippery slope", where the [...] "next <b>close</b> <b>case</b> comes up and the precedent in the last <b>close</b> <b>case</b> is applied: same thing, same thumb on the scale, same decision". Calabresi argued that this process ultimately leads to the ongoing expansion of doctrine that was originally established only on a narrow basis. Additionally, Ward Farnsworth has argued that judges often resolve <b>close</b> <b>cases</b> [...] "according to beliefs the judges bring to the case that don’t owe much to law".|$|R
5000|$|Although some {{scholars}} have suggested that [...] "a <b>close</b> <b>case</b> {{is in the eye}} of the beholder", other scholars have attempted to articulate specific criteria for identifying <b>close</b> <b>cases.</b> Maureen Armoor, for example, defines <b>close</b> <b>cases</b> as [...] "the articulable outer limit of judicial discretion that most closely approximates the phenomenological experience of a sitting judge, in particular the dimension of discretion called into play when a judge is uncertain about an outcome". Ward Farnsworth, dean of the University of Texas School of Law, has suggested that <b>close</b> <b>cases</b> could be defined as either [...] "cases close enough to provoke dissent" [...] or cases that [...] "are flexible enough to comfortably admit of more than one reading". Likewise, a 1980 comment in the Stanford Law Review defined <b>close</b> <b>cases</b> as appellate decisions that generated multiple dissenting opinions.|$|R

50|$|For the Greek state, the {{expulsion}} of Muslim Chams was a <b>closed</b> <b>case.</b> The atrocities committed against the Muslim Cham community are absent from official documents, {{which suggests that the}} state wished to erase any evidence of what had occurred. The very limited number of printed material that surfaced after the war attempted to reconstruct the events that transpired during the turbulent period with the implicit aim of justifying {{the expulsion}}, which might also be termed as ethnic cleansing by a number of scholars. During the Cold War period the Greek origin theory of Muslim Chams became a central theme, appearing even in scientific works, and the Albanian linguistic tradition of the area was continuously downplayed. In this way, and in accordance with the approach of claiming a territory through its population, a purely Greek history and character of Chameria was retained in official politics.|$|E

50|$|The story {{concludes with}} Barry {{escaping}} the 25th century court and going after Top. Top {{reveals that the}} reason for all of his crimes is because Barry reopened a previously <b>closed</b> <b>case.</b> Barry felt that the person convicted was actually innocent. The person who is actually guilty of the crime is one of Top's ancestors. Top reveals that they do not allow anyone in the Renegades who has any ancestors with a criminal record. The Flash is able to beat Top, and convict the right man for murder, letting go the innocent man who was sent to prison. Afterward, the 25th century court and the Renegades go over the facts, realizing that the Flash was right and that their entire record of history is wrong. This alludes to the upcoming Flash event, Flashpoint. Meanwhile, a man on a Speed Force-powered motorcycle (later revealed to be a Speed Force police officer under the name of Hot Pursuit) moves through the desert and says that if Barry does not find the flashpoint, it will destroy the world.

This was {{in connection with the}} deadly shooting in the backstage area, two days prior on another stop of the tour in Mountain View, California. When the police raided his tour bus, they found an AK-47 military-style assault rifle, as well as guns on several members of his entourage. In total six people, including Jeezy were arrested, because [...] "no one admitted to owning the assault rifle." [...] His bail was set at one million dollars. On August 26, Jeezy entered a not guilty plea to possession of an illegal assault rifle and the other five men who were arrested with Jeezy also entered not guilty pleas. Two days later, Jeezy and his associates bonded out. As it would turn out, the AK-47 is legally registered to Jeezy's security chief, who was not even on the bus {{at the time of the}} raid. At the time, his security chief was in the hospital after getting shot at an MTV VMAs pre-party where Suge Knight was also shot six times. It has been reported that the AK-47 was not found anywhere near Jeezy, and it was in a <b>closed</b> <b>case</b> in an area associated with someone other than Jeezy. He was in an entirely separate part of the bus during the raid and no weapons were found around him.

40|$|We {{consider}} a Swiss Cheese {{model with a}} random arrangement of Lemaître [...] Tolman [...] Bondi holes in ΛCDM cheese. We study two kinds of holes with radius r_b= 50 h^- 1 Mpc, with either an underdense or an overdense centre, called the open and <b>closed</b> <b>case,</b> respectively. We calculate {{the effect of the}} holes on the temperature, angular diameter distance and, {{for the first time in}} Swiss Cheese models, shear of the CMB. We quantify the systematic shift of the mean and the statistical scatter, and calculate the power spectra. In the open case, the temperature power spectrum is three orders of magnitude below the linear ISW spectrum. It is sensitive to the details of the hole, in the <b>closed</b> <b>case</b> the amplitude is two orders of magnitude smaller. In contrast, the power spectra of the distance and shear are more robust, and agree with perturbation theory and previous Swiss Cheese results. We do not find a statistically significant mean shift in the sky average of the angular diameter distance, and obtain the 95 % limit |Δ D_A/D̅_A|≲ 10 ^- 4. We consider the argument that areas of spherical surfaces are nearly unaffected by perturbations, which is often invoked in light propagation calculations.

Many cite positive outcomes associated with specific types of residential programs. However, due to continuing concerns about the safety and well-being of youth enrolled in private programs, the Committee requested that GAO (1) identify and examine the facts and circumstances surrounding additional <b>closed</b> <b>cases</b> where a teenager died, was abused, or both, while enrolled in a private program; and (2) identify cases of deceptive marketing or questionable practices in the private residential program industry. To develop case studies of death and abuse, GAO conducted numerous interviews and examined documents from eight <b>closed</b> <b>cases</b> from 1994 to 2006. GAO used covert testing along with other investigative techniques to identify, for selected cases, deceptive marketing or questionable practices. Specifically, posing as fictitious parents with fictitious troubled teenagers, GAO called 14 programs and related services. GAO did not attempt to evaluate the benefits of private residential programs and its results cannot be projected beyond the specific programs and services that GAO reviewed. ...|$|R
