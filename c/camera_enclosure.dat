50|$|Eyerman {{was born}} in Butte, Montana. His parents were photographers. After opening his own {{structural}} engineering firm in Seattle, he developed new tools to photograph in difficult situations. He developed a type of electric eye to photograph the atomic bomb test at Yucca Flat, Nevada, in 1952. Underwater photograph work with Otis Barton involved making a <b>camera</b> <b>enclosure</b> suitable for photographing the depths. Eyerman also utilized a concave mirror to photograph the aurora borealis. He covered World War II for Life on the European and Pacific fronts.|$|E
5000|$|The LG G5's {{overall design}} was praised for its {{shift to a}} metal construction. The Next Web was {{critical}} of its design, arguing that {{the rear of the}} phone looked too [...] "boring" [...] because it was simply a rounded rectangle with a <b>camera</b> <b>enclosure</b> and power button that [...] "protrude in an oddly wart-like manner" [...] and a visible seam for the chin, and noting that the lack of curvature and its [...] "hollow" [...] feel made the design of the G5 [...] "less premium" [...] than that of the G4. Techradar was also mixed on LG's decision to re-locate the volume keys back to the bezel but maintain the rear-mounted power button as a fingerprint reader, noting that front and side-mounted fingerprint readers were easier to use—especially if the device is sitting flat. Due to its use of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 system-on-chip, the G5's specifications were considered to be more competitive in comparison to other flagships, unlike the G4, which used a model with reduced core count to avoid the overheating issues of the Snapdragon 810. Techradar felt that the G5's performance was on par with the Snapdragon 820-based version of the Samsung Galaxy S7 sold in the United States, and that [...] "in day-to-day use, and when not directly compared to its rivals' performance in a lab, it feels super slick." ...|$|E
5000|$|SP 9113 when being rebuilt {{carried the}} {{unofficial}} identity 'SPMW #1'. The railroad's traffic computer required 4 digits, {{and so it}} emerged from the shop bearing a small SPMW 1166 stencil. In June 1969 it was renumbered to SP 8799, in standard Southern Pacific locomotive lettering configuration. The most drastic change in appearance was the locomotive's short hood (or [...] "nose"), which had been removed. In its place, a custom structure was fabricated to house twin Mitchell 35-millimeter film cameras and Nagra III timecode magnetic recording equipment, with stand-up headroom and two seats salvaged from another KM for operators. Heavy, thick steel was used for collision protection and to replace lost weight. The front Voith L830rU transmission was removed to create space for the <b>camera</b> <b>enclosure,</b> while the Number 1 radiator compartment was emptied of radiators and ancillary equipment to house an Onan skid-mount generator to power the camera equipment. The two engines and rear transmission were simply disabled, principally being retained for weight. All gearboxes and Cardan (universal) shafts were removed; gears were left in place on the six axles. All of the controls remained in the cab {{so that it could}} control a locomotive pushing behind it, much like a cab car is used on a commuter train. The camera car could be put on the lead of any train, but it primarily operated as special trips with just one locomotive behind it for power. Known locomotives used for power are a single EMD F7 B-unit, an EMD GP-9, an EMD GP35, and a Cotton Belt (St. Louis Southwestern) SD45T-2.|$|E
30|$|Physical Attacks. Our {{main concern}} are {{software}} {{attacks on the}} cameras and the delivered data. Attacks on camera hardware, including hardware manipulation as well as power and timing analysis [12] are {{beyond the scope of}} this work. We however assume that, for example, with specifically designed <b>camera</b> <b>enclosures</b> and circuit boards, a reasonable degree of resistance against tampering can be achieved. If a hardware attack involves the reboot of the camera, this should be detectable for camera operators.|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: Automated sensing of crop {{water stress}} is {{required}} to provide real-time variable-rate irrigation control that responds to spatial and temporal variability of plant water needs. Plant structural parameters such as internode length in cotton (i. e. the distance between successive main stem branches) are recognised as significant indicators of water stress level. This paper demonstrates the successful automatic identification of nodes and measurement of internode lengths. A moving in-field <b>camera</b> <b>enclosure</b> involving plant contact was trialed in the (Australian) 2005 / 06 cotton growing season. The enclosure continuously traversed the crop canopy, collecting video footage of the cotton plants. The enclosure design utilises the natural flexibility of the growing crop to force (non-destructively) the plant’s main stem onto a fixed object plane which enables the direct measurement of geometric dimensions {{without the need for}} stereo vision. Plant features are discriminated via processing of successive images to identify the main stem and branches, and hence stem-branch junctions (‘nodes’) are located. After confirmation that the plant structure is in the required object plane (by comparison of adjacent frames), the measurements of internode lengths are calculated. From fourteen sequences of images, with typically fifty images per sequence, main stem identification has been achieved in up to 88...|$|E
40|$|Abstract]Pressure {{on water}} {{resources}} in Australia necessitates improved application {{of water to}} irrigated crops. Cotton is one of Australia’s major crops, but is also a large water user. On-farm water savings {{can be achieved by}} irrigating via large mobile irrigation machines (LMIMs), which are capable of implementing deficit strategies and varying water application to 1 m 2 resolution. However, irrigation amounts are commonly held constant throughout a field despite differing water requirements for different areas of a crop due to spatial variability of soil, microclimate and crop properties. This research has developed a non-destructive cotton plant dimensional measurement system, capable of mounting on a LMIM and streaming live crop measurement data to a variable-rate irrigation controller. The sensor is a vision system that measures the cotton plant attribute of internode length, i. e. the distance between main stem nodes (or branch junctions) on the plant’s main stem, which is a significant indicator of plant water stress. The vision system consisted of a Sony camcorder deinterlaced image size 720 × 288 pixels) mounted behind a transparent panel that moved continuously through the crop canopy. The camera and transparent panel were embodied in a contoured fibreglass <b>camera</b> <b>enclosure</b> (dimensions 535 mm × 555 mm × 270 mm wide) that utilised the natural flexibility of the growing foliage to firstly contact the plant, such that the top five nodes of the plant were in front of the transparent panel, and then smoothly and non-destructively guide the plant under the curved bottom surface of the enclosure. By forcing the plant into a fixed object plane (the transparent panel), reliable geometric measurement was possible without the use of stereo vision. Motorisation of the <b>camera</b> <b>enclosure</b> enabled conveyance both across and along the crop rows using an in-field chassis. A custom image processing algorithm was developed to automatically extract internode distance from the images collected by the camera, and comprised both single frame and sequential-frame analyses. Single frame processing consisted of detecting lines corresponding to branches and calculating the intersection of the detected lines with the main stem to estimate candidate node positions. Calculation of the ‘vesselness’ function for each pixel using the Hessian matrix eigenvalues determined whether the pixel was likely to belong to a stem (i. e. a curvilinear structure). Large areas of connected high-vesselness pixels were identified as branches. For each branch area, centre points were determined by solving the second order Taylor polynomial in the direction perpendicular to the line direction. The main stem was estimated with a linear Hough transform on the branch centre points within the image. Lines were then fitted to the centre points of other branch segments using the hop-along line-fitting algorithm and these lines were selectively projected to the main stem to estimate candidate node positions. The automatically-identified node positions corresponded to manual position measurements made on the source images. Within individual images, leaf edges were erroneously detected as candidate nodes (‘false positives’) and contributed up to 22...|$|E
40|$|An Image Compression and Authentication Module (ICAM) {{has been}} {{designed}} to perform the digitization, compression, and authentication of video images in a <b>camera</b> <b>enclosure.</b> The ICAM makes it possible to build video surveillance systems that protect the transmission and storage of video images. The ICAM functions with both NTSC 525 line and PAL 625 line cameras and contains a neuron chip (integrated circuit) permitting it to be interfaced with a local operating network {{which is part of the}} Modular Integrated Monitor System (MIMS). The MIMS can be used to send commands to the ICAM from a central controller or any sensor on the network. The ICAM is capable of working as a stand alone unit or it can be integrated into a network of other cameras. As a stand alone unit it sends its video images directly over a high speed serial digital link to a central controller for storage. A number of ICAMs can be multiplexed on a single coaxial cable. In this case, images are captured by each ICAM and held until the MIMS delivers commands for an individual image to be transmitted for review or storage. The ICAM can capture images on a time interval basis or upon receipt of a trigger signal from another sensor on the network. An ICAM which collects images based on other sensor signals, forms the basis of an intelligent {open_quotes}front end{close_quotes} image collection system. The burden of image review associated with present video systems is reduced by only recording the images with significant action. The cards used in the ICAM can also be used to decompress and display the compressed images on a NTSC/PAL monitor...|$|E
40|$|Acquiring cheap, moving {{video was}} {{impossible}} {{in a vacuum}} environment, due to camera overheating. This overheating is {{brought on by the}} lack of cooling media in vacuum. A water-jacketed <b>camera</b> cooler <b>enclosure</b> machined and assembled from copper plate and tube has been developed. The camera cooler (see figure) is cup-shaped and cooled by circulating water or nitrogen gas through copper tubing. The camera, a store-bought "spy type," is not designed to work in a vacuum. With some modifications the unit can be thermally connected when mounted in the cup portion of the camera cooler. The thermal conductivity is provided by copper tape between parts of the camera and the cooled enclosure. During initial testing of the demonstration unit, the camera cooler kept the CPU (central processing unit) of this video camera at operating temperature. This development allowed video recording of an in-progress test, within a vacuum environment...|$|R
