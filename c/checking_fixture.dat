In order to enhance CF design quality and efficiency, this paper proposes a portable quality-confirmation inspection device for automotive part. The concept of the computer-aided CF design includes a new volume bounding box generation approach for a gantry system framework. Embedded in the system, is a multi objective optimization algorithm which is used for locator layout design and a multi-surface extension and transition method for checking the surface quality...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{location}} of a checked part {{is one of the}} most critical and complicated problems in the <b>checking</b> <b>fixture</b> design for thin-walled parts with less stiffness. The unreasonable layout of locators will give rise to the high deflection of the checked part and affect measure accuracy. Based on the “N- 2 - 1 ” locating principle, an optimization method is presented to determine the locator layout, where the finite element method is used to calculate the maximal deformation of the work piece which is used to be an objective function of optimization, and the Particle Swarm Optimization with fine performance of global convergence is adopted as an optimization solver to seek for the optima. Finally, a case study is presented to verify the proposed method...|$|E
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} {{systematic}} method for the optimal design of sensor locations for an automated Coordinate <b>Checking</b> <b>Fixture</b> (CCF). The fixture {{can be employed}} for making at-machine assessments of the dimensional accuracy of manufactured components. Coordinate measurements obtained by the sensors built into the fixture can be utilized in estimating geo-metric parameters of a manufactured part. Two important issues that arise {{in the design of}} a CCF are the optimal number of sensors to be used and the best locations for each sensor. The proposed method uses statistical analyses of the Fisher information matrix and the prediction matrix to obtain an optimal set of sensors from an initial candidate set. Sensors are placed at locations that maximize the determinant of the Fisher information matrix for best parameter es-timation, while the sensor of the least contribution to the measurement objective is iteratively eliminated. With the benefit of physical insight, the design procedure results in a balanced de-cision for the ultimate placement of sensors. The developed method also addresses the problem of selection of part locators for part localization in the CCF. Examples are provided for illus-tration of the developed procedure for automotive space frame extrusion parts. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Machining {{parameters}} {{are very important}} in determining the surface quality of any material. In the past decade, some new engineering materials were developed for the manufacturing industry which created a need to conduct an investigation {{on the impact of}} the said parameters on their surface roughness. Polyurethane (PU) block is widely used in the automotive industry to manufacture parts such as <b>checking</b> <b>fixtures</b> that are used to verify the dimensional accuracy of automotive parts. In this paper, the design of experiment (DOE) was used to investigate on the effect of the milling parameters on the PU block. Furthermore, an analysis of the machined surface chemical composition was done using scanning electron microscope (SEM). It was found that the surface roughness of the PU block is severely affected when PU undergoes a flood machining process instead of a dry condition. In addition the stepover and the silicon content were found to be the most significant parameters that influence the surface quality of the PU block. Keywords—Polyurethane (PU), design of experiment (DOE), scanning electron microscope (SEM), surface roughness. I...|$|R
40|$|Ruled {{surface is}} widely used in {{engineering}} design such as parting surface design of injection mold and checking surface design of <b>checking</b> <b>fixture,</b> which are usually generated by offsetting 3 D curves. However, in 3 D curve offset, there often exist break,interaction and overlapping problems which can't be solved by current CAD software automatically. This paper is targeted at developing a 3 D curve offsetting algorithm for ruled surface generation, and three key technologies are introduced in details: An improved curve division method is proposed to reduce the offset accuracy error resulted from different offset distances and curvatures; An offsetting curve overlapping detection and elimination method is proposed; And then, a curve transition method is presented to improve curve offsetting quality for the break and intersection/overlapping regions, where a new algorithm for generating positive weights spherical rational quartic Bezier curve is proposed to bridge the breaks of offset curves to create a smooth ruled surface. Finally, two practical design cases, parting surface and checking surface generation, show that the proposed approach can enhance the efficiency and quality for ruled surface generation in engineering design...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a {{database}} for checking fixtures for automotive parts. The parts used in the fixture checking process were automotive parts such as clamper, stand and toggle. The goal of this project is to implement a database of checking fixtures parts. The project started with identifying the current problems that were faced by the designer at a design department, in a support service for automotive industries. Idle time has been the major problem that designer have to faced. All the data and information related to this project has been sought and explored in the literature review. Catia software is used as the CAD software to construct threedimensional models for the design of all the parts in the parts library. All the parts are organized in three different sizes which are determined by the size of car body panel. Referring to the result, new libraries were developed and created using the Catia software to aid designers in the <b>checking</b> <b>fixture</b> design process. The validation of the new libraries had been conducted with the company’s design engineer to test the effectiveness, usability and relevancy. In summary, this database and method can potentially accelerate the checking fixtures design process to be faster and more efficient...|$|E
