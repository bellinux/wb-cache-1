SPC produced DH values between 3. 6 - 4. 1 %, obtained from the three {{different parts of the}} digestive tract. Canola paste produced high DH in the stomach by adding phytase to 0. 8 and 2 % feed.

The DH from stomach with crustacean meals (shrimp meal and <b>crab</b> <b>meal)</b> ranged from 32 - 87 %, while values for dried whey from the ceca and intestine ranged from 6 - 7. 4 %.

Nine isocaloric diets (321. 92 ± 9. 10 kcal g− 1) were evaluated for 60 days. The highest digestibility of crude protein values for {{animal and plant}} sources were obtained for the whey (93. 6) and extruded bean meal (90. 5) diets, respectively. The final body weight was higher for the red crab and extruded chickpea meal diets, meanwhile the fish silage and red crab byproducts obtained the highest protein efficiency ratio. Hematocrit was similar among the diets of each byproduct source and presented correlation with growth parameters. The highest glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride values were obtained for fish silage (138. 0, 260. 5, and 389. 0 mg dL− 1, respectively) and whey meal (174. 5, 242. 3, and 284. 0 mg dL− 1, respectively) groups. A positive correlation {{was found between the}} digestibility of crude protein of ingredients and chymotrypsin activity.

40|$|Primary {{goals of}} this thesis were to: 1) examine the in vivo {{digestion}} of macronutrients from conventional or alternative feed ingredients used in practical diets of juvenile gadoids (Atlantic cod and haddock), 2) document growth potential of fish at the juvenile grower phase given {{varying levels of}} dietary protein and energy and 3) assess the potential of in vitro pH-Stat methods for rapid screening protein quality of feed ingredients, specifically for gadoids. All primary research questions were linked to and built upon one another {{with the goal of}} gaining a better understanding of protein and energy utilization of juvenile grower phase gadoids. Studies showed that cod and haddock have a high capacity to utilize a wide range of dietary feed ingredients, such as fish meals, zooplankton meal, soybean products (meal, concentrate and isolate) and wheat gluten meal. New dietary formulations for gadoids may also utilize pulse meals, corn gluten meal, canola protein concentrate and <b>crab</b> <b>meal.</b> Digestibility data in this thesis is currently the only research that examined both in vivo and in vitro macronutrient digestibility of a large number and wide range of individual ingredients, specifically for gadoids. This is essential to gain new knowledge on protein and energy utilization as well as for least-cost ration formulations and effective substitution of ingredients into new formulations. Data has demonstrated a dietary digestible protein/digestible energy (DP/DE) ratio of 30 g DP/MJ DE is required for gadoids during the juvenile phase (< 100 g) to ensure maximum somatic tissue growth, high digestibility, maximum nitrogen and energy retention efficiency and minimal excessive liver growth. Preliminary nutrient requirement studies together with an applied nutritional approach has identified that feeds for juveniles farmed in the Western North Atlantic should contain 50 - 55 % crude protein, < 12 % fat and < 17 % carbohydrate. Data in this thesis is currently the first aimed at development and application of an in vitro closed-system pH-Stat assay for rapid screening protein quality of test ingredients that is ‘species-specific’ to gadoids. It is demonstrated that in vitro results generally reflected results obtained through conventional in vivo protein digestibility methods. Studies resulted in the first generation of a ‘gadoid-specific’ proteolytic enzyme extraction method and in vitro closed-system pH-Stat assay which may be useful to investigate protein digestion, absorption and metabolism of gadoids and further development of their feeds.  ...|$|E
40|$|Aquafeed {{production}} faces {{global issues}} related to availability of feed ingredients. Feed manufacturers require greater flexibility {{in order to develop}} nutritional and cost-effective formulations that take into account nutrient content and availability of ingredients. The search for appropriate ingredients requires detailed screening of their potential nutritional value and variability at the industrial level. In vitro digestion of feedstuffs by enzymes extracted from the target species has been correlated with apparent protein digestibility (APD) in fish and shrimp species. The present study verified the relationship between APD and in vitro degree of protein hydrolysis (DH) with Litopenaeus vannamei hepatopancreas enzymes in several different ingredients (n = 26) : blood meals, casein, corn gluten meal, <b>crab</b> <b>meal,</b> distiller`s dried grains with solubles, feather meal, fish meals, gelatin, krill meals, poultry by-product meal, soybean meals, squid meals and wheat gluten. The relationship between APD and DH was further verified in diets formulated with these ingredients at 30 % inclusion into a reference diet. APD was determined in vivo (30. 1 +/- 0. 5 degrees C, 32. 2 +/- 0. 4 %.) with juvenile L vannamei (9 to 12 g) after placement of test ingredients into a reference diet (35 g kg(- 1) CP: 8. 03 g kg(- 1) lipid; 2. 01 kcal g(- 1)) with chromic oxide as the inert marker. In vitro DH was assessed in ingredients and diets with standardized hepatopancreas enzymes extracted from pond-reared shrimp. The DH of ingredients was determined under different assay conditions to check for the most suitable in vitro protocol for APD prediction: different batches of enzyme extracts (HPf 5 or HPf 6), temperatures (25 or 30 degrees C) and enzyme activity (azocasein) : crude protein ratios (4 U: 80 mg CP or 4 U: 40 mg CP). DH was not affected by ingredient proximate composition. APD was significantly correlated to DH in regressions considering either ingredients or diets. The relationships between APD and DH of the ingredients could be suitably adjusted to a Rational Function (y = (a + bx) /(1 + cx + dx 2), n = 26. Best in vitro APD predictions were obtained at 25 degrees C, 4 U: 80 mg CP both for ingredients (R(2) = 0. 86 : P = 0. 001) and test diets (R(2) = 0. 96; P = 0. 007). The regression model including all 26 ingredients generated higher prediction residuals (i. e., predicted APD - determined APD) for corn gluten meal, feather meal. poultry by-product meal and krill flour. The remaining test ingredients presented mean prediction residuals of 3. 5 points. A model including only ingredients with APD> 80 % showed higher prediction precision (R(2) = 0. 98 : P = 0. 000004; n = 20) with average residual of 1. 8 points. Predictive models including only ingredients from the same origin (e. g., marine-based, R(2) = 0. 98; P = 0. 033) also displayed low residuals. Since in vitro techniques have been usually validated through regressions against in vivo APD, the DH predictive capacity may depend on the consistency of the in vivo methodology. Regressions between APD and DH suggested a close relationship between peptide bond breakage by hepatopancreas digestive proteases and the apparent nitrogen assimilation in shrimp, and this may be a useful tool to provide rapid nutritional information.
