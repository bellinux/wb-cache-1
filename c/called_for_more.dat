5|$|On 14 September 1955, the Apostolic Vicariate of Dakar {{became an}} archdiocese, and Lefebvre thus {{became the first}} Metropolitan Archbishop of Dakar. Archbishop Lefebvre {{was the first and}} {{foremost}} advisor to Pius XII during the writing of the encyclical Fidei Donum (1957), which instructed the clergy and laity on the missions in the Third World countries and <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> missionaries.|$|E
5|$|As governor, Wickliffe's {{primary concern}} was the Panic of 1837. He {{advocated}} raising property taxes to offset spending deficits that had climbed to $42,000 by 1839, but the legislature borrowed money to meet the current expenses instead. Wickliffe maintained the state's credit by paying the interest due on state securities. The only areas where he <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> spending were improvements in river navigation, preservation of state archives, and public education. Aside from these concerns, he was inundated with requests for clemency.|$|E
5|$|As one policy initiative, Nixon <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> {{money for}} sickle-cell research, treatment, and {{education}} in February 1971 and signed the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act on May 16, 1972. While Nixon called for increased spending on such high-profile items as sickle-cell disease {{and for a}} War on Cancer, {{at the same time}} he sought to reduce overall spending at the National Institutes of Health.|$|E
5000|$|All 3 Courts {{continue}} to be under funded. Current delays (2016) range between 2 years (Adelaide) and 4 years (rural Australia). Some divorce proceedings last over a decade. Increasing levels of community dissatisfaction with the delays and the haphazard nature of outcomes, is leading to <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> substantive reform. Competing reform options include a fast 50/ 50 split(the New Zealand model, now favoured by The Productivity Commission [...] ), substantially reducing judicial discretion by codifying the existing law , <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> government funding (The Law Society), <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> mediation, and [...] "peoples juries" [...] (One Nation) ...|$|R

5|$|Billy Clanton {{was shot}} in the wrist, chest and abdomen, and after a minute or two slumped to a sitting {{position}} near his original position {{at the corner of the}} MacDonald house in the lot between the house and Fly's Lodging House. Claiborne said Clanton was supported by a window initially after he was shot, and fired some shots after sitting, with the pistol supported on his leg. After he ran out of ammunition, he <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his pistol at about the time the general shooting ended.|$|E
5|$|Despite the block, Salmaniya Medical Complex's {{disaster}} {{plan was}} activated {{on the morning}} of the attack. It <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> than a dozen ambulances to search nearby areas and Pearl Roundabout. Another dozen ambulances were put on stand-by, according to a member of the medical staff. The staff said that ambulances were functioning in accordance with the plan until about 6:00am, when an alleged call from the Ministry of Interior ordered all but two ambulances to head back to the SMC. However, this order was ignored and more ambulances were sent to search for the injured in the areas surrounding the roundabout.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, NJDOT {{announced}} that {{work on the}} $335 million projects for repaving and restoration of the roadway would begin {{at the end of}} 2013. To facilitate the work, the eastbound lanes (northbound US1/9) would close for two years after the Super Bowl XLVIII in February 2014 at the nearby Meadowlands Sports Complex. The proposal was opposed by local politicians, who contended that it did not satisfactorily address the effect on local traffic and <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> thorough investigation into alternatives. The closure date was postponed by NJDOT to more completely work out comprehensive traffic and travel options.|$|E

Commission chairman Jones <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> limited-access roads to be built across the country for defense purposes, and the turnpike was {{a model for a}} proposed national network of highways planned during World War II. The Pennsylvania Turnpike led to the construction of other toll roads, such as the New Jersey Turnpike and (eventually) the Interstate Highway System. It has been designated a National Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers.|$|E
5|$|Soegijapranata {{left for}} Semarang on 30September 1940 and was consecrated by Willekens on 6October at the Holy Rosary Church in Randusari, which later became his seat; this consecration made Soegijapranata the first native Indonesian bishop. The {{ceremony}} {{was attended by}} numerous political figures and sultans from Batavia, Semarang, Yogyakarta, and Surakarta, as well as clergy from Malang and Lampung; Soegijapranata's first act as vicar was to issue a pastoral letter with Willekens that outlined the historical background {{that led to his}} appointment, including Pope BenedictXV's apolistic letter Maximum Illud, which <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> local clergy, and Pope PiusXI and Pope PiusXII's efforts to appoint more pastors and bishops from native ethnic groups worldwide. Soegijapranata began working on the Church hierarchy in the region, establishing new parishes.|$|E
5|$|As the WSPU gained {{recognition}} and notoriety for its actions, Pankhurst resisted efforts to democratise the organisation itself. In 1907 {{a small group}} of members led by Teresa Billington-Greig <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> involvement from the rank-and-file suffragettes at the union's annual meetings. In response, Pankhurst announced at a WSPU meeting that elements of the organisation's constitution relating to decision-making were void and cancelled the annual meetings. She also insisted that a small committee chosen by the members in attendance be allowed to co-ordinate WSPU activities. Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel were chosen (along with Mabel Tuke and Emmeline Pethick Lawrence) as members of the new committee. Frustrated, several members including Billington-Greig and Charlotte Despard quit to form their own organisation, the Women's Freedom League. In her 1914 autobiography Pankhurst dismissed criticism of the WSPU's leadership structure:if at any time a member, or a group of members, loses faith in our policy; if any one begins to suggest that some other policy ought to be substituted, or if she tries to confuse the issue by adding other policies, she ceases at once to be a member. Autocratic? Quite so. But, you may object, a suffrage organisation ought to be democratic. Well the members of the W. S. P. U. do not agree with you. We do not believe in the effectiveness of the ordinary suffrage organisation. The W. S. P. U. is not hampered by a complexity of rules. We have no constitution and by-laws; nothing to be amended or tinkered with or quarrelled over at an annual meeting... The W. S. P. U. is simply a suffrage army in the field.|$|E

Gabbard claimed {{that she had been}} disinvited from the first debate for her protestations, which Schultz and the DNC have denied occurred.

5|$|In late 1984 Chrisye {{approached}} {{another young}} composer, Adjie Soetama, {{to help him}} prepare his next album. Light beats and cheerful melodies were in vogue at the time; therefore the two used a lighter style. Recording for the new album, titled Aku Cinta Dia (I Love Her), began in 1985, with additional songs from Guruh and Dadang S. Manaf. The titular song was chosen after Aciu heard a jam session led by Adjie and immediately decided {{that it would be}} the lead single. The album <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> emoting, which Chrisye– known as having a stiff stage persona– struggled to deliver, though Yanti prepared colourful costumes and Alex Hasyim trained him in choreography. Upon its release, Aku Cinta Dia sold hundreds of thousands of copies in the first week and was eventually certified gold. That same year, Chrisye and Adji Soetama released Hip Hip Hura (Hip Hip Hurray!), and another collaboration, Nona Lisa (Miss Lisa), was released in 1986; the later two albums had similar beats and rhythms and sold well, although not as well as Aku Cinta Dia. On 2 March 1986 Chrisye and Yanti had their second daughter, Risty Nurraisa.|$|E
