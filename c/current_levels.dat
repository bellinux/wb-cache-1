5|$|The {{most common}} {{electrode}} holder is a semiautomatic air-cooled holder. Compressed air circulates {{through it to}} maintain moderate temperatures. It is used with lower <b>current</b> <b>levels</b> for welding lap or butt joints. The second {{most common type of}} electrode holder is semiautomatic water-cooled, where {{the only difference is that}} water takes the place of air. It uses higher <b>current</b> <b>levels</b> for welding T or corner joints. The third typical holder type is a water cooled automatic electrode holder—which is typically used with automated equipment.|$|E

5|$|Since U.S. {{beekeeper}} Nephi Miller {{first began}} moving his hives to {{different areas of}} the country for the winter of 1908, migratory beekeeping has become widespread in America. Bee rental for pollination is a crucial element of U.S. agriculture, which could not produce anywhere near its <b>current</b> <b>levels</b> with native pollinators alone. U.S. beekeepers collectively earn much more from renting their bees out for pollination than they do from honey production.|$|E

5|$|Two hazards {{are uniquely}} {{identified}} with the dam. One is that sedimentation projections are not agreed upon, {{and the other is}} that the dam sits on a seismic fault. At <b>current</b> <b>levels,</b> 80% of the land in the area is experiencing erosion, depositing about 40million tons of sediment into the Yangtze annually. Because the flow is slower above the dam, much of this sediment will now settle there instead of flowing downstream, and there will be less sediment downstream.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} weeks before the election, the issue of Chinese {{immigration}} entered the race. Both major parties (as well as the Greenbackers) pledged in their platforms to limit immigration from China, which native-born workers in the Western states believed was depressing their wages. On October 20, however, a Democratic newspaper published a letter, purportedly from Garfield {{to a group of}} businessmen, pledging to keep immigration at the <b>current</b> <b>levels</b> so that industry could keep workers' wages low. Garfield denounced the letter as a ruse, but not before one hundred thousand copies of the newspaper were mailed to California and Oregon. Once the letter was exposed as a forgery, Garfield biographer Peskin believes it may even have gained votes for the Republican in the East, but it likely weakened him in the West.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} one of the most modern {{incinerators}} operating in England; it is noted for its innovative operation. In 2009, an extension was completed at the station, with the construction of an extra furnace line and a rail head. This increased the capacities of the plant from 19.2MW and 250,000 tonnes of waste per year to its <b>current</b> <b>levels.</b> The plant initially burned only waste from Teesside, but this was extended to include Northumberland with the 2009 extension. A second plant, the North East Energy Recovery Centre (NEERC), has planning permission to be built on land adjacent to the current plant. If built, this will extend the plant's catchment to include waste from south Tyne and Wear.|$|E
