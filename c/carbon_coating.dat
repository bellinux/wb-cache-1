40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine the differences in heat transfer enhancement of poly alpha olefin oil after the addition of two types of <b>carbon</b> <b>coated</b> nanoparticles, specifically <b>carbon</b> <b>coated</b> cobalt and <b>carbon</b> <b>coated</b> copper nanoparticles. The carbon shell allows for the nanoparticles to be homogenously dispersed in the oil and remain stable throughout the experimental procedure. The nanofluids were prepared in concentrations of 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 wt%. A constant surface heat flux testing rig is used to determine the heat transfer coefficients of the base fluids and the nanofluids. Inlet temperatures to the heat transfer section of the rig and flow rate of the fluid are varied to allow analysis of the impact of fluid temperature and Reynolds number. Testing occurred at temperatures of 50, 65, and 90 oC and fluid flow rates of 10 to 100 mL/s. The <b>carbon</b> <b>coated</b> copper nanoparticles showed the largest heat transfer enhancement at a fluid temperature of 65 oC and at a loading concentration of 1. 0 wt%. In general heat transfer enhancement decreased as both particle concentration and fluid temperature increased. The <b>carbon</b> <b>coated</b> cobalt nanoparticles exhibited the largest heat transfer enhancement at a fluid temperature of 90 oC and a particle concentration of 1. 5 wt%. Heat transfer enhancement generally increased as both temperature and particle concentration increased. Overall heat transfer enhancement by the <b>carbon</b> <b>coated</b> copper nanoparticles was larger than the enhancement provided by the <b>carbon</b> <b>coated</b> cobalt nanoparticles at the same flow rate, temperature, and concentration.

50|$|Sputter coating in {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} is a sputter deposition process to cover a specimen with {{a thin layer of}} conducting material, typically a metal, such as a gold/palladium (Au/Pd) alloy.

50|$|Additional {{research}} has involved depositing a <b>carbon</b> <b>coating</b> onto the silicon nanowires, which helps stabilize the material such that a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) forms. An SEI is an inevitable {{byproduct of the}} electrochemistry that occurs in the battery; its formation contributes to decreased capacity in the battery since it is an electrically insulating phase (despite being ionically conductive). It can also dissolve and reform over multiple battery cycles. Hence, a stable SEI is preferable {{in order to prevent}} continued capacity loss as the battery is used. When carbon is coated onto silicon nanowires, capacity retention has been observed at 89% of the initial capacity after 200 cycles. This capacity retention is on par with that of graphitic anodes today.|$|E

The nanofibers contain 10 nm diameter nanopores on their surface. Along with additional gaps in the fiber network, these allow for silicon to expand without damaging the cell. Three other factors reduce expansion: a 1 nm shell of silicon dioxide; a second <b>carbon</b> <b>coating</b> that creates a buffer layer; and the 8-25 nm fiber size, which is below the size at which silicon tends to fracture.|$|E

The company introduced the Heart Beat Calibre FC 935 Silicium in October 2007. It implements new high tech materials to create better, more precise and more reliable mechanical watches. Deep reactive-ion etching is used to shape silicon wafers into escapement wheels, pallets, and plateaus. Silicon is lighter, harder and stronger than metal. Etched into tiny skeletal structures that {{would be impossible to}} form with metal, it becomes the featherweight heart of a mechanism that can run at a far higher accuracy.

50|$|The {{presence}} of gas around a specimen creates new possibilities unique to ESEM: (a) Liquid-phase electron microscopy is possible since any pressure greater than 609 Pa allows water {{to be maintained}} in its liquid phase for temperatures above 0 °C, {{in contrast to the}} SEM where specimens are desiccated by the vacuum condition. (b) Electrically non-conductive specimens do not require the preparation techniques used in SEM to render the surface conductive, such as the deposition of a thin gold or <b>carbon</b> <b>coating,</b> or other treatments, techniques which also require vacuum in the process. Insulating specimens charge up by the electron beam making imaging problematic or even impossible. (c) The gas itself is used as a detection medium producing novel imaging possibilities, as opposed to vacuum SEM detectors. (d) Plain plastic scintillating BSE detectors can operate uncoated without charging. Hence, these detectors produce the highest possible signal-to-noise-ratio at the lowest possible accelerating voltage, because the BSE do not dissipate any energy in an aluminium coating used for the vacuum SEM.|$|E
