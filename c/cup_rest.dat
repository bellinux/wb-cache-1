50|$|The {{sculpture}} The Holy Grail (1922) {{was given}} two names by Maltwood: The Holy Grail, {{which it is}} most commonly known as, and Samadhi. The former title refers to her interest in Arthurian legends and foreshadows her discovery of the Glastonbury Zodiac. The latter title, Samadhi, is a Sanskrit word that {{can be defined as}} a state of consciousness induced by complete meditation. The idol holds a cup in his hands. The hand posture is inspired by tai chi. Tai chi movements are meant to build and release energy flow in the body and mind. The <b>cup</b> <b>rests</b> in a spiritually sensitive space, which signifies the importance of the cup. Maltwood believed that the cup “embodied the lost knowledge that man must rediscover to achieve spiritual salvation” (Brown, p. 34).|$|R

50|$|The Anglo-Welsh Cup, {{now known}} for {{sponsorship}} reasons as the LV= Cup, is {{the successor to}} a tournament founded in the 1971-72 season as the RFU Club Competition.

With only seven left to play {{before the end of the}} season and Valencia was in a desperate situation in the table, Koldo Aguirre replaced Miljanic, who had been dismissed after losing 5-2 in Sarriá.|$|R
