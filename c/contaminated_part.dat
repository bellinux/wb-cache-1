It {{is well known that}} this problem is NP-hard, and therefore we seek efficient, but not optimal, solutions by relaxing the problem and applying the tools of Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Receding Horizon Control (RHC). Approaches using MILP and RHC are known to produce efficient algorithms in other path planning domains, such as obstacle avoidance. Here we show how the MILP formalism {{can be used in a}} pursuit evasion setting to capture the motion of the pursuers as well as the partitioning of the pursuit search region into a cleared and a <b>contaminated</b> <b>part.</b> RHC is furthermore a well known way of balancing performance and computation requirements by iteratively solving path planning problems over a receding planning horizon, and adapt the length of that horizon to the computational resources available.

Both the DuraCrete model and the ClinConc model were used for prediction of chloride penetration profiles. Actual chloride penetration profiles were measured from the cores taken from the structure. The chloride transport properties in the non-chloride <b>contaminated</b> <b>part</b> of the concrete were measured using the Rapid Chloride Migration Test (NT BUILD 492). The modelled chloride profiles were compared with the measured ones. The results show that the ClinConc model predicted the chloride penetration depths with an adequate accuracy. Based on the modelled results it can be concluded that alkali leaching can dramatically change chloride binding capacity, resulting in flat chloride penetration profiles. When using the DuraCrete model for predicting chloride penetration profiles the parameter for the surface chloride content has to be adjusted from the recommended value of 10. 3 to 3. 4 {{in order to make the}} predicted profiles comparable with the actually measured ones...|$|E

Dives with the MIR submersibles during the e´LEMO project permitted the exploration of {{a large portion of}} Vidy Bay. It is the most <b>contaminated</b> <b>part</b> of Lake Geneva, due to inputs of treated and untreated waters from a large wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). To evaluate the influence of WWTP effluent on mercury contamination and sediment characteristics, 14 sediment cores were retrieved {{in the vicinity of the}} wastewater treatment plant effluent. Total mercury concentrations in sediments ranged between 0. 32 and 10. 1 mg/kg. Inorganic mercury and monomethylmercury concentrations in overlying and pore waters were also measured. The total partition coefficients of mercury (logKd) ranged from 3. 6 to 5. 8. The monomethylmercury concentration in pore waters of surface sediments was a large proportion of the total mercury concentration (44 ± 25 %). A Spearman test showed a negative correlation between the distance to the wastewater treatment plant outlet and the concentrations of total mercury in sediments and pore waters. Visual observations from the submersible allowed recognizing six different types of sediment. The areal distribution of these different sediment types clearly showed the influence of the wastewater treatment plant outlet on the sediment surface patterns.

This area was chosen because it was the most heavily radionuclide <b>contaminated</b> <b>part</b> of Chiba Prefecture and it neighbors metropolitan Tokyo. Measurements were performed using a 3 -in × 3 -in NaI(Tl) scintillation spectrometer in June 2015. The survey route covered the whole Tokatsu area which includes six cities. A heterogeneous distribution of absorbed dose rate in air was observed on the dose distribution map. Especially, higher absorbed dose rates in air exceeding 80 nGy h- 1 were observed along national roads constructed using high porosity asphalt, whereas lower absorbed dose rates in air were observed along local roads constructed using low porosity asphalt. The difference between these asphalt types resulted in a heterogeneous dose distribution in the Tokatsu area. The mean of the contribution ratio of artificial radionuclides to absorbed dose rate in air measured 4 years after the accident was 29 % (9 - 50 %) in the Tokatsu area. The maximum absorbed dose rate in air, 201 nGy h- 1 was observed at Kashiwa City.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate fungal bioaerosol concentrations in relation to particulate matter (PM 10, PM 2. 5 and PM 1) in indoor parts and ambient air of the generd educational hospital of Khorramabad city. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive-analytical study, 192 samples (168 for indoor and 24 for outdoor) were gathered during 6 months at the seven indoor wards and one outdoor unit using Quick Take- 30 method  at an airflow rate of 28. 3 L/min and sampling time of 2. 5 min on to Sabouraud dextrose agar medium containing chloramphenicol.

We {{examined}} the species diversity and abundance of Collembola at 32 sampling points along a gradient of metal contamination {{in a rough}} grassland site (Wolverhampton, England), formerly used for the disposal of metal-rich smelting waste. Differences in the concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn between the least and most <b>contaminated</b> <b>part</b> of the 35 metre transect were more than one order of magnitude. A gradient of Zn concentrations from 597 to 9080 lg g) 1 dry soil was found. A comparison between field concentrations of the four metals and previous studies on their relative toxicities to Collembola, suggested that Zn {{is likely to be}} responsible for any ecotoxicological effects on springtails at this site. Euedaphic (soil dwelling) Collembola were extracted by placing soil cores into Tullgren funnels and epedaphic (surface dwelling) species were sampled using pitfall traps. There was no obvious relationship between the total abundance, or a range of commonly used diversity indices, and Zn levels in soils. However, individual species showed considerable differences in abundance. Metal ‘‘tolerant’ ’ (e. g., Ceratophysella denticulata) and metal ‘‘sensitive’ ’ (e. g., Cryptopygus thermophilus) species could be identified. Epedaphic species ap-peared to be influenced less by metal contamination than euedaphic species. This difference is probably due to the higher mobility and lower contact with the soil pore water of epedaphic springtails in comparison to euedaphic Collembola.

40|$|Colloids play a {{critical}} role in the transport of particle-bound contaminants. Knowledge of colloids and their aggregates provides insight into contaminant transport and fate within a given aquatic environment. Here, colloids and aggregates at the sediment-water interface of Vidy Bay, Lake Geneva, Switzerland, were characterized with a combination of analytical techniques to understand their structure, size distribution, concentration, and stability (the potential for aggregation). Vidy Bay is known to be the most <b>contaminated</b> <b>part</b> of Lake Geneva, being influenced by the effluents of a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Colloids were a heterogeneous mix of inorganic constituents (diatom fragments, quartz, clay, endogenic calcite, iron oxy-hydroxides) bridged together by rigid biopolymer strands or gels. The presence of rigid biopolymers was quite significant and they were typically found to have iron oxy-hydroxides embedded within their structure. Ion chromatographic data were comparable to previous values attained for the water column of Lake Geneva; however, single particle counting results indicated the presence of a nepheloid layer in Vidy Bay. In such, the stability of colloids was likely influenced by their proximity to the sediment-water interface. Zeta potential results inferred charge neutralization and destabilization of colloids and aggregates. Self-assembly of rigid biopolymers, along with cationic bridging between rigid biopolymers and inorganic constituents readily aggregated colloids. Taken together, colloids at the sediment water interface of Vidy Bay appeared to be unstable and to play a minor role in the transport of contaminants over long distances...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this chapter}} {{is to provide a}} simple {{deterministic}} mathe- matical approach to modeling the transmission of microparasites between two host populations living on distinct spatial domains. We shall consider two prototypi- cal situations: (1), a vector borne disease and, (2), an environmentally transmitted disease. In our models direct horizontal criss{cross transmission from infectious in- dividuals of one population to susceptibles of the other one does not occur. Instead parasite transmission takes place either through indirect criss{cross contacts be- tween infective vectors and susceptible individuals and vice{versa in case (1), and through indirect contacts between susceptible hosts and the <b>contaminated</b> <b>part</b> of the environment and vice{versa in case (2). We shall also assume the microparasite is benign in one of the host populations, a reservoir, that is it has no impact on demography and dispersal of individuals. Next we assume it is lethal to the second population. In applications we have in mind the second population is human while the ¯rst one is an animal { avian or rodent { population.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate seropositivity against H 9 N 2 and H 7 N 7 viruses among poultry and slaughter-house workers with occupational risk of exposure to poultry in Tehran province. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional seroprevalence study was performed using two types of HI assay among 127 poultry and slaughter-house workers and 25 controls with the regular consumer related exposure to poultry against H 9 N 2 and H 7 N 7 avian influenza viruses. Data were analyzed using SAS 9. 1. Results: There was no evidence of previous H 7 N 7 infection among subjects. Both poultry workers had elevated antibod-ies against H 9 N 2 Influenza viruses compared to controls. Slaughter-house workers who self-reported eviscerating poultry with their bare hands had markedly increased evidence of previous H 9 N 2 infection (15. 7 %) compared to controls (0 %) (OR= 18. 241, 95 % CI ([6. 802 - 48. 914]). Conclusions: Our results suggest poultry-to-human transmission of avian influenza A H 9 N 2 can occur in poultry workers. Eviscerating section workers, in contrast to others had the highest risk of H 9 N 2 infection.

Results showed that plutonium isotopes (i. e., 239 Pu, 240 Pu, 241 Pu, and 242 Pu) were detected in all samples, although in extremely low concentrations. The 241 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios measured in sediment deposits (0. 0017 - 0. 0884) {{were significantly higher than}} the corresponding values attributed to the global fallout (0. 00113 ± 0. 00008 on average for the Northern Hemisphere between 31 °- 71 ° N: Kelley, J.

The results indicated the presence of Pu from FDNPP, in slight excess compared to the Pu background from global fallout that represented up to ca. 60 % of Pu in the analyzed samples. These results demonstrate that this radionuclide has been transported relatively long distances (∼ 45 km) from FDNPP and been deposited in rivers representing a potential source of Pu to the ocean.

40|$|This {{study is}} a rare example of “the {{ecosystem}} approach to management” that {{has been carried out}} for the purpose of providing practical support to decision-makers in managing a Site of National Interest (SIN) where activities such as fishing, aquaculture and swimming are restricted. Benthic ecosystem functioning was assessed to verify whether {{it would be possible to}} exclude the less <b>contaminated</b> <b>part</b> from the SIN and its legislative constraints. At five macrosites subjected to diversified industrialization and anthropization, we evaluated the structural characteristics of the sediments, both heterotrophic and phototrophic communities, and the main processes of production, transformation and consumption of organic matter at seven stations, plus a reference site. Along the north-eastern boundary of the bay, the port, shipbuilding and iron foundry areas, characterized by high levels of contaminants, low macrozoobenthic diversity, major organic contents (up to 51. 1 mgC g− 1) and higher numbers of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria (up to 5, 464 MPN gdry− 1), differed significantly (RANOSIM = 0. 463, p = 2. 9 %) from the other areas (stations). Oxygen consumption (− 15. 22 ± 1. 59 mgC m− 2) prevailed over primary production and the trophic state was net heterotrophic. In contrast, on the other side of the harbor (residential area/center bay), contamination levels were below the legal limits and both the microalgal and macrobenthic communities displayed higher biodiversity. Higher macrofaunal abundances (up to 753 ± 174. 7 ind. m− 2), primary production rates (up to 58. 60 ± 8. 41 mgC m− 2) and exoenzymatic activities were estimated. nMDS and SIMPROF analyses performed on benthic communities significantly separated the most contaminated stations from the other ones. Overall, by applying this holistic approach, a better environmental situation was highlighted along the southern boundary of the bay and according to these results this part of the bay could be excluded from the SIN. However, further sampling is required along a finer sampling grid in the less contaminated side of the port in order to confirm these first results.

40|$|We {{examined}} the species diversity and abundance of Collembola at 32 sampling points along a gradient of metal contamination {{in a rough}} grassland site (Wolverhampton, England), formerly used for the disposal of metal-rich smelting waste. Differences in the concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn between the least and most <b>contaminated</b> <b>part</b> of the 35 metre transect were more than one order of magnitude. A gradient of Zn concentrations from 597 to 9080 mug g(- 1) dry soil was found. A comparison between field concentrations of the four metals and previous studies on their relative toxicities to Collembola, suggested that Zn {{is likely to be}} responsible for any ecotoxicological effects on springtails at this site. Euedaphic (soil dwelling) Collembola were extracted by placing soil cores into Tullgren funnels and epedaphic (surface dwelling) species were sampled using pitfall traps. There was no obvious relationship between the total abundance, or a range of commonly used diversity indices, and Zn levels in soils. However, individual species showed considerable differences in abundance. Metal "tolerant'' (e. g., Ceratophysella denticulata) and metal "sensitive'' (e. g., Cryptopygus thermophilus) species could be identified. Epedaphic species appeared to be influenced less by metal contamination than euedaphic species. This difference is probably due to the higher mobility and lower contact with the soil pore water of epedaphic springtails in comparison to euedaphic Collembola. In an experiment exposing the standard test springtail, Folsomia candida, to soils from all 32 sampling points, adult survival and reproduction showed small but significant negative relationships with total Zn concentrations. Nevertheless, juveniles were still produced from eggs laid by females in the most contaminated soils with 9080 mug g(- 1) Zn. Folsomia candida is much more sensitive to equivalent concentrations of Zn in the standard OECD soil. Thus, care should be taken in extrapolating the results of laboratory toxicity tests on metals in OECD soil to field soils, in which, the biological availability of contaminants is likely to be lower. Our studies have shown the importance of ecotoxicological effects at the species level. Although there may be no differences in overall abundance, sensitive species that are numerous in contaminated sites, and which may play important roles in decomposition("keystone species'') can be greatly reduced in numbers by pollution...|$|E
40|$|Long term use of copper-based {{fungicides}} {{in coffee}} fields to control fungal diseases has caused accumulation of copper (Cu). The accumulation of Cu in the soils poses potential hazards {{to the environment}} and potentially may harm the population through contamination of the food web. High Cu concentrations may cause phytotoxicity. The hazards of using Cu based fungicides for coffee production is relatively limited because coffee is a deep-rooted crop. Because Cu in soils tends to be rather immobile, high concentrations are found only within 10 cm of the top soil. Nevertheless, small contents may be leached to lower parts of the soil profile as a result of movement of organic matter complexed Cu. This may contaminate ground water. Coffee farmers in Kilimanjaro and Arusha grow coffee inline with other food crops. Due to low coffee prices in the 1980 s the majority of farmers decided to uproot coffee trees and grow food crops such as maize, beans, tomatoes, cabbage, Amaranthus, etc., on the Cu contaminated soils. These crops are shallow rooted and therefore they grow on the <b>contaminated</b> <b>part</b> of the soil. There is a potential danger of taking up the Cu and contaminate the food web. Soil properties such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic matter, texture and redox potential (Eh) play a vital role on mobility and bioavailability of Cu. The extent of Cu contamination in soils of coffee farms in Kilimanjaro and Arusha was assessed. Furthermore, the concentrations of Cu in leaves of coffee, bean and banana that have been grown on Cu contaminated soils were determined. In addition, the vertical distribution of Cu in Cu contaminated soils and in control soils was examined. Bean is a crop that is widely intercropped with coffee in Kilimanjaro and Arusha regions and it is widely used as a test crop for Cu phytotoxicity worldwide. Farmers in Kilimanjaro and Arusha apply organic amendments on their coffee fields. Therefore, a field study on the influence of three organic amendments, cattle manure, poultry manure and forest litter at different application rates on Cu solubility and availability to Phaseolus vulgaris was carried out. We also carried out glass house experiments to explore the effects of inorganic fertilizers, cattle manure and their interaction effects on Cu solubility and availability to Phaseolus vulgaris. The effects of aging on Cu bioavailability and the role of humic and fulvic acids on binding of Cu in spiked soils and in long term Cu contaminated soils were explored. Copper concentrations in contaminated soils exceeded background Cu concentrations. The concentrations were high enough to raise concerns. For coffee, beans and banana leaves, Cu remained within the critical Cu concentrations needed by healthy plants. However, Cu concentrations in leaves of plants grown on contaminated soils were higher than these in leaves of plants collected from the uncontaminated soils. High Cu concentrations greatly exceeding background Cu concentrations reported worldwide were found within the top 30 cm of the affected soils. Copper mobility in fallow soils was more limited than in tilled soils. There was a positive correlation between silt content and the concentrations of Cu in soils. Potentially mobile Cu fractions, which decreased with soil depth, were higher in contaminated soils than in uncontaminated soils. Poultry manure at 40 ton ha- 1 significantly increased CaCl 2 extractable Cu compared with the control treatment in a field study. Forest litter and cow manure did not affect CaCl 2 extractable Cu. Organic carbon (OC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), EDTA-extractable Cu and Cu concentrations in bean seeds or leaves were not significantly changed by the organic matter treatments. The concentrations of Cu were significantly lower in bean seeds than was the case in bean leaves. In a glass house experiment, cattle manure at 15 % application rate in Moshi soils decreased the EDTA-extractable Cu compared with a control treatment. The highest concentration of Cu in bean shoots was observed in the Moshi soils treated with inorganic fertilizers but without cattle manure. Cattle manure in Moshi soils significantly reduced the concentrations of Cu in bean shoots compared with the control treatment while in Mwanga soils the cattle manure had no significant effects. Spiking soils with CuSO 4 significantly increased extractable Cu as expected. For all the treatments except for the Mwanga and Arumeru control soils, the addition of CuSO 4 did not significantly increase the humic acid bound Cu, but it significantly increased the fulvic acid bound Cu. Bean shoots grown on Moshi soils revealed significantly higher concentrations of Cu than was the case with other soils. For the respective soil types, {{there was no significant difference}} in the concentrations of Cu in bean leaves between spiked and unspiked treatments. The bean plant did not take up excessive quantities of Cu and therefore the risks of Cu contamination of bean crops in the studied soils appear to be low. The homeostatic mechanisms of bean plants appeared to be effective to maintain Cu concentrations in the plant tissues within normal concentrations on all soils tested. It is concluded that soils in coffee plantations may contain elevated concentrations of Cu. However, the Cu in the soils is rather immobile and therefore the risk of contaminating underground water resources as a result of its vertical movement appears to be low. Furthermore, Cu in coffee plantations was not excessively taken up by coffee, banana and bean plants. Therefore the risk of contaminating the food web is limited. However, more studies are needed to assess the Cu uptake by other crops that are grown on Cu contaminated coffee plantations. Englis...|$|E
40|$|From 2011 in the NRC "Kurchatov Institute" {{carry out}} the {{dismantling}} of the MR multiloop research reactor. Now the reactor and all technological equipment in the premises of the reactor were dismantled. Now the measurements of radioactive contamination in the reactor premises are made. The most <b>contaminated</b> <b>parts</b> of premises - floor and the ground beneath it. To measure the distribution of specific activity in the ground the CdZnTe detector (volume 500 MM 3) was used. Detector placed in a lead shielding with a slit collimation hole. The upper part of shielding is made movable to close and open the slit of the collimator. At each point two measurements carried out: with open and closed collimator. The software for determination specific activity of radionuclides in ground was developed. The mathematical model of spectrometric system based on the Monte-Carlo method. Measurements of specific activity of ground were made. Using the results of measurements the thickness of the removed layer of ground and the amount of radioactive waste were calculated...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the principles of}} ‘Reactive Interfacial Chemical Cleaning’, a technique that is widely used in many high-tech industries to clean <b>contaminated</b> <b>parts.</b> The two key steps in this process, mass transport and reaction kinetics, are described briefly. One dimensional cleaning models are developed for both steady state and unsteady state situations, and contaminant etch rates are predicted. Special attention is given to physical descriptions during model formulation rather than detailed mathematics. Cleaning analysis is extended to multidimensional problems {{with the aid of}} a two dimensional example. The finite lement method is used as the computational technique to simulate this model problem. The role of dimensionless groups such as the Reynolds number, bulk Peclet number, Damkohler number, Schmidt number and Sherwood number is emphasized through out this study. It is shown that an increase in the values of any of these dimensionless groups leads to an increase in contaminant removal rates and hence the cleaning process. Cleaning of materials and equipment is an integral part of many high tech operation...|$|R

In the UK, only in 2012 the mandatory radioactivity testing of sheep in <b>contaminated</b> <b>parts</b> of the UK that graze on lands was lifted. They covered 369 farms on 750 km2 and 200,000 sheep. In parts of Sweden and Finland, restrictions are in place on stock animals, including reindeer, in natural and near-natural environments. [...] "In certain regions of Germany, Austria, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Lithuania and Poland, wild game (including boar and deer), wild mushrooms, berries and carnivorous fish from lakes reach levels of several thousand Bq per kg of caesium-137", while [...] "in Germany, caesium-137 levels in wild boar muscle reached 40,000 Bq/kg. The average level is 6,800 Bq/kg, more than ten times the EU limit of 600 Bq/kg", according to the TORCH 2006 report. The European Commission has stated that [...] "The restrictions on certain foodstuffs from certain Member States must therefore continue to be maintained for many years to come".|$|R
40|$|Participation of U. S. {{scientists}} on the COPERNIC (COmplete Positive ions, Electrons and Ram Negative Ion measurements near Comet Halley) plasma experiment on the Giotto mission is described. The experiment {{consisted of two}} detectors: the EESA (electron electrostatic analyzer) which provided three-dimensional measurements {{of the distribution of}} electrons from 10 eV to 30 keV, and the PICCA (positive ion cluster composition analyzer) which provided mass analysis of positively charged cold cometary ions from mass 10 to 210 amu. In addition, a small 3 deg wide sector of the EESA looking in the ram direction was devoted to the detection of negatively charged cold cometary ions. Both detectors operated perfectly up to near closest approach (approx. 600 km) to Halley, but impacts of dust particles and neutral gas on the spacecraft <b>contaminated</b> <b>parts</b> of the data during the last few minutes. Although no flight hardware was fabricated in the U. S., The U. S. made very significant contributions to the hardware design, ground support equipment (GSE) design and fabrication, and flight and data reduction software required for the experiment, and also participated fully in the data reduction and analysis, and theoretical modeling and interpretation.
