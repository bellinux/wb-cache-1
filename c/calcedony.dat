5000|$|Vesicles - Many lavas are {{vesicular}} in {{the upper}} part of a flow. These vesicles are often infilled by minerals (especially zeolites) and/or weathering products from the lava to form an amygdaloidal texture. Some two-phase amygdales, such as where a mineral has grown in a vesicle that was part-filled by fluid affecting the mineral form (e.g. opal versus <b>calcedony),</b> can be used as geopetal structures.|$|E
