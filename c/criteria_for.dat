5|$|There are {{two studies}} on the {{incidence}} of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that children from the maltreatment sample {{were significantly more likely}} to meet <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups, however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified RAD or DAD. The second study, also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be reliably identified in maltreated rather than neglected toddlers. Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD RAD and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled the DSM <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> RAD. This study found that RAD could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some methodological concerns with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> RAD did in fact have a preferred attachment figure.|$|E

5|$|Childe {{has been}} {{considered}} the principal contributor to archaeological methodology {{in the first part}} of the 20th century. His theoretical approach blended together Marxism, diffusionism, and functionalism. Childe was critical of the evolutionary archaeology which was dominant during the 19thcentury. He believed that those archaeologists who adhered to it placed a greater emphasis on artefacts themselves rather than their makers. He recognised flaws in the technological-based three-age system first developed by Danish antiquarian Christian Jürgensen Thomsen, rejecting its evolutionary chronology that divided prehistory into the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age by noting that many of the world's societies were still effectively Stone Age in their technology. He nevertheless saw it as a useful model for analysing socio-economic development when combined with a Marxist model. He therefore used technological <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> dividing up prehistory into three ages, but instead used economic <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> sub-dividing the Stone Age into the Palaeolithic and Neolithic, rejecting the concept of the Mesolithic as useless.|$|E
