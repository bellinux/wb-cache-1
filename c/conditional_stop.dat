40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the {{repeated}} confidence interval approach is important because it can guarantee nominal confidence levels for inferences made <b>conditional</b> on <b>stopping.</b> Thus, it provides a method for constructing conditionally acceptable sequential procedures. - 3 -Professors Jennison and Turnbull are to be congratulated for so clearly presenting such an important advance in the topic of sequential analysis. One of the major strengths of their approach is that their interim analyses produce acceptable interim inferences, that is, acceptable inferences <b>conditional</b> on <b>stopping.</b> In many sequential procedures the overall confidence level is not maintained conditionally. It can happen that the conditional confidence level, <b>conditional</b> on <b>stopping</b> early, is uniformly less than the nominal level. (For example, Stein's two- stage confidence interval for a normal mean does not maintain 1 - a coverage if the procedure stops at the first stage, as shown in Casella, 1988.) A strength of the Jennison- Turn bull approach is that the nominal confidence level can be maintained no matter when the procedure stops, a property guaranteed by construction. Although this property may result in intervals that ar...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{average time}} of {{computing}} Boolean functions by straight-line programs with a <b>conditional</b> <b>stop</b> is considered. A straight-line program consists of operators of two types. Every operator {{of the first}} type computes a binary Boolean function whose arguments are either the values computed by preceding operators or {{the values of the}} input variables. Every operator of the second type either terminates execution of the program or commands that the next operator is executed. A measure of the complexity of such programs is the average execution time over all tuples of the input variables. The complexity of computing almost all complete Boolean functions and almost all partial Boolean functions by such programs is proved to coincide (up to a multiplicative constant) with conventional circuit complexity. Moreover, these complexities are proved to differ (up to a multiplicative constant) by a factor of n for almost all n-place Boolean functions that are equal to 1 on nc tuples. It is proved that there exist Boolean functions of n variables whose average execution time is less (up to a multiplicative constant) by a factor of (2 n/n) 1 / 2 than the time required to compute them by conventional straight-line programs...|$|E
40|$|Imaging {{studies have}} shown that {{response}} inhibition and conflict resolution, key executive functions essential for adaptive behaviour, are mediated by fronto-striatal circuits, specifically the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Overactivity of the STN and underactivation of the pre-SMA are features of Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this thesis was to investigate the hypothesis that the STN is involved in inhibition of action and serves to provide time for reflection and to slow down decision-making under conflict (Frank et al. 2006; 2007). The <b>conditional</b> <b>stop</b> signal reaction time was used. In Study 1, compared to controls, medicated PD patients showed impaired motor inhibition with prolonged stop signal reaction times (SSRTs), problems with conflict resolution, and impairment on tests of cognitive inhibition. In Study 2, PD patients were impaired on motor inhibition and conflict resolution compared to controls both on and off medication. Most importantly, medication status did not influence motor inhibition or conflict resolution in PD. In Study 3, bilateral deep brain stimulation of the STN impaired inhibition as indicated by significantly prolonged SSRTs, but had no significant effect on conflict resolution. However, Study 4, showed that compared to controls and unoperated PD, PD with unilateral subthalamotomies showed faster Go RTs and less conflict-induced slowing but at the expense of greater response selection errors. Finally, Study 5 investigated the contributions of the pre-SMA and IFG to motor inhibition and conflict resolution in healthy controls using transcranial magnetic stimulation. The results confirmed that the contribution of the right pre-SMA to response inhibition is essential. The results are consistent with the proposal that the STN and pre-SMA are involved in reactive inhibition and that the STN together with the pre-SMA influences the response threshold and speed-accuracy trade-offs. ...|$|E

5000|$|The new Western Pacific RDC {{service was}} dubbed the [...] "Zephyrette" [...] due to both its {{supplemental}} relationship and (thanks to its stainless steel exteriors) visual {{resemblance to the}} California Zephyr. After replacing the Royal Gorge in the Western Pacific's timetable, the two Zephyrettes inherited its train numbers: 1 and 2. The inaugural eastbound Zephyrette left Oakland on September 15, 1950, while the first westbound train departed Salt Lake City two days later, on September 17, 1950. The service operated on a tri-weekly schedule, with eastbound trains departing Oakland at 7:57 pm every Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday, and their westbound counterparts leaving Salt Lake City at 7:30 am on the same days. Eastbound, the train's running time was 22 hours and 48 minutes, while westbound it was 23 hours and 30 minutes. In total, the Zephyrette route extended for 924 mi and included 19 scheduled stops, as well as nearly 100 <b>conditional</b> <b>stops.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Zephyrettes {{lacked the}} luxurious {{appointments}} of the California Zephyr, foregoing foodservice entirely and providing only hot and cooled water for refreshments. Although the RDCs typically ran the route alone, {{during periods of}} peak demand the Western Pacific ran them in short trains behind an EMD F3, a water tender, and a baggage car. In October 1950, the railroad had computed the direct operating costs for the Zephyrette RDCs at 71 cents per train-mile, almost half the cost incurred by its conventional predecessor, the Royal Gorge. In addition to their relative economic efficiency, the cars also gained a reputation for reliability: one Western Pacific employee even likened one of the RDCs to [...] "a big Buick". They also provided numerous advantages over conventional consists, {{especially in terms of}} their ability to accelerate quickly and maintain high sustained speeds, which allowed for faster service of the route's <b>conditional</b> <b>stops</b> than had previously been possible. While the Zephyrettes had initially been profitable for the Western Pacific, they did not remain so, and the service was ended on October 2, 1960.|$|R
25|$|The Company made it {{very clear}} that {{published}} timetables were only to indicate the times before which a train would not depart and the specified times for each stop were only given as a rough guide. Trains normally made three regular and eight <b>conditional</b> <b>stops,</b> but 'expresses' did run which did not stop between Bideford and Westward Ho!. With two engines in steam the frequency could be every half-hour, but a train every hour or so was the norm in summer, normally taking about 20 minutes from Bideford to Northam or 15 minutes for the 'express'. Fifteen trains ran in each direction in the July 1906 Bideford to Northam timetable and lighter service of four ran on Sundays. The 1910 Bradshaw's Timetable shows trains taking thirty minutes for the journey from Bideford to Appledore, ten trains in each direction, with an extra run on the Market Days (Tuesdays and Saturdays) and no trains on Sundays. The winter timetable for 1 November 1917 to 30 April 1918, which was destined never to be used, was down to seven trains in each direction and no Sunday service. Horse-drawn buses ran from Westward Ho! to Clovelly and through tickets were issued from Instow to cover the journey by ferry, railway and road transport. The bus service cost £51 18s 0d (£51.90) to run for the six months ending 31 December 1906.|$|R

We relax this assumption and allow the agent to take any uninspected box without inspecting its contents when stopping. Thus, each uninspected box is now a potential outside option. This introduces a new trade-off: every time the agent inspects a box, he loses {{the value of the}} option to take it without inspection. Nevertheless, we find that, under conditions common in the search and information acquisition literature, boxes are inspected following the same order as inWeitzman's rule; however, the stopping rule is different, and we characterize it. Moreover, we provide additional results that partially characterize the optimal policy when these conditions fail...|$|R

Our changes of measures are parameterized by a family of distributions admitting a mixture form. We exploit our methodology to achieve two types of results. First, we construct Monte Carlo estimators that are strongly efficient (i. e. have bounded relative mean squared error as the event of interest becomes rare). These estimators are used to estimate both rare-event probabilities of interest and associated conditional expectations. We emphasize that our techniques allow us to control the expected termination time of the Monte Carlo algorithm even if the <b>conditional</b> expected <b>stopping</b> time (under the original distribution) given the event of interest is infinity–a situation that sometimes occurs in heavy-tailed settings. Second, the mixture family serves as a good Markovian approximation (in total variation) of the conditional distribution of the whole process given the rare event of interest.

Upon the earliest of the accused being arrested for an alleged breach or upon the issuance of a warrant, the <b>conditional</b> sentence <b>stops</b> running. At a breach hearing the Crown bears the onus to prove a breach on a balance of probabilities. If the court finds that a breach occurred, the accused bears to onus to justify the continuation of the conditional sentence.

We find that white pedestrians are slightly less likely than African American pedestrians to be arrested <b>conditional</b> on being <b>stopped.</b> We interpret this finding as evidence that the officers making the stops are on average not biased against African Americans relative to whites, because the latter are stopped despite being a less productive stop for a police officer.

40|$|We {{solve the}} problem of optimal {{stopping}} of a Brownian motion subject to the constraint that the stopping time's distribution is a given measure consisting of finitely-many atoms. In particular, we show that this problem can be converted to a finite sequence of state-constrained optimal control problems with additional states corresponding to the <b>conditional</b> probability of <b>stopping</b> at each possible terminal time. The proof of this correspondence relies on a new variation of the dynamic programming principle for state-constrained problems which avoids measurable selection. We emphasize that distribution constraints lead to novel and interesting mathematical problems on their own, but also demonstrate an application in mathematical finance to model-free superhedging with an outlook on volatility.

40|$|Anecdotal and circumstantial {{evidence}} {{suggest that the}} implementation of Secure Communities, a federal program that allows police officers to more easily identify illegal immigrants, has increased racial bias by police. The goal of this analysis is to empirically evaluate the effect of Secure Communities on racial bias by police using motor vehicle stop and search data from the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation. This objective differs from most previous research, which has largely attempted to quantify racial profiling {{for a moment in}} time rather than looking at how an event influences racial profiling. I examine the effects of Secure Communities on police treatment of Hispanics vs. whites with an expanded difference-in-difference approach that looks at outcomes in motor vehicle search success rate, search rate conditional on a police stop, stop rate, and police action <b>conditional</b> on <b>stop.</b> Statistical analyses yield no evidence that the ratification of Secure Communities increased racial profiling against Hispanics by police.

The viewing conditions and simulation dynamics replicated visual rates and environments of transport aircraft landing at small commercial airports. The required frame rate was estimated from the FR-extrapolation of event probabilities <b>conditional</b> on predictions (<b>stop,</b> no-stop), and from a model fit to the perceptual discriminability A (average area under all proper ROC-curves) as dependent on FR.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} detecting an odd process {{among a group of}} Poisson point processes, all having the same rate except the odd process. The actual rates of the odd and non-odd processes are unknown to the decision maker. We consider a time-slotted sequential detection scenario where, {{at the beginning of each}} slot, the decision maker can choose which process to observe during that time slot. We are interested in policies that satisfy a given constraint on the probability of false detection. We propose a generalised likelihood ratio based sequential policy which, via suitable thresholding, can be made to satisfy the given constraint on the probability of false detection. Further, we show that the proposed policy is asymptotically optimal in terms of the <b>conditional</b> expected <b>stopping</b> time among all policies that satisfy the constraint on the probability of false detection. The asymptotic is as the probability of false detection is driven to zero. We apply our results to a particular visual search experiment studied recently by neuroscientists. Our model suggests a neuronal dissimilarity index for the visual search task. The neuronal dissimilarity index, when applied to visual search data from the particular experiment, correlates strongly with the behavioural data. However, the new dissimilarity index performs worse than some previously proposed neuronal dissimilarity indices. We explain why this may be attributed to the experiment conditons.

40|$|The Caulobacter crescentus {{chromosomal}} clp locus {{contains the}} genes encoding {{the components of}} ClpXP, a multisubunit protease required for cell cycle progression in this organism. Here, we report the identification and characterization of cicA, a gene located between the clpX and clpP genes on the Caulobacter chromosome. cicA is a novel morphogene in C. crescentus and, like clpX and clpP, is essential for growth. A <b>conditional</b> cicA mutant <b>stopped</b> growth, but retained viability under restrictive conditions. In contrast, an increased concentration of CicA led to an immediate loss of the normal rod shape, an almost 10 -fold increase of the cell's volume and a cell division block. In parallel with this drastic morphological change, cells rapidly lost viability. Primary sequence analysis suggested that the cicA gene encodes {{a member of a}} large superfamily of phosphotransferases, that include phosphoserine phosphatases, the ATPase domain of P-type ATPases and receiver domains of response regulators. Four conserved motifs of this protein family that have been implicated in the catalysis of phosphotransfer reactions were investigated by site-directed mutagenesis and were found to be critical for in vivo function of CicA. Based on our observations, we postulate that CicA is involved in essential phosphotransferase reactions in Caulobacter and that increased activity of CicA has a deleterious effect on cell wall biosynthesis, morphogenesis and cell division...|$|R
40|$|Recursive binary {{partitioning}} is {{a popular}} tool for regression analysis. Two fundamental problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been {{known for a long}} time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of <b>conditional</b> inference procedures. <b>Stopping</b> criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore the models induced by both approaches are structurally different, confirming the need for an unbiased variable selection. Moreover, it is shown that the prediction accuracy of trees with early stopping is equivalent to the prediction accuracy of pruned trees with unbiased variable selection.

40|$|For large {{epidemiological}} observational studies {{banks of}} biological samples are sometimes created. To study specific research hypotheses blood, urine or tissue specimens {{can be obtained}} from participants to a study and stored for later analysis in a biological bank. Constantly new biochemical, molecular or genetic laboratory techniques are developed. These allow a large number of (new) etiologic hypotheses to be tested on the stored biological material to investigate interesting associations between an exposure and a disease. The amount of stored biological material however is, in general, limited, in particular for the cases (the persons who develop the disease of interest), when the disease is not so common. Furthermore, with most laboratory techniques biological material is destroyed and cannot be used for another test. To combine the large number of interesting hypotheses with the limited number and amount of biological samples statistical methods are needed that can distinguish between more promising and less promising hypotheses at the expense of as little biological material as possible. Sequential statistical methods offer a researcher the possibility to terminate an investigation as soon as sufficient evidence has accumulated to accept the null hypothesis ("no association between exposure and disease") or to reject it in favour of the alternative hypothesis ("an association exists between exposure and disease"). After each new observation or group of observations the accumulated data are tested. Based on the cumulative test result the study is stopped or more information is obtained. A sequential analysis requires, on average, fewer observations to come to a decision ("accept the null hypothesis or reject it") than the corresponding fixed sample size analysis. Sequential methods are thus an efficient way to handle the available data. Matching is used to make cases and controls more comparable by controlling for possible confounding factors. These factors are related to both exposure and disease and may distort the size of the exposure-disease relation. In a case-control study one or more controls can be matched to a case based on the value of the confounding factor. A matched design requires in general less cases and controls than an unmatched design. Matching is thus another way of efficient data handling. The chapters of this thesis describe various sequential tests that can be applied in matched case-control studies. Sequential tests were developed for continuous and dichotomous exposure variables. (Group) sequential analysis was proposed as an alternative for <b>conditional</b> power to <b>stop</b> a study early for 'futility'. Sequential tests for the analysis of gene-environment interactions in matched case-control studies were developed.
