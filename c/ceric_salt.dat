2500|$|The Belousov–Zhabotinsky {{reaction}} is a spatio-temporal chemical oscillator {{that can be}} simulated {{by means of a}} cellular automaton. In the 1950s A. M. Zhabotinsky (extending the work of B. P. Belousov) discovered that when a thin, homogenous layer of a mixture of malonic acid, acidified bromate, and a <b>ceric</b> <b>salt</b> were mixed together and left undisturbed, fascinating geometric patterns such as concentric circles and spirals propagate across the medium. In the [...] "Computer Recreations" [...] section of the August 1988 issue of Scientific American, A. K. Dewdney discussed a cellular automaton developed by Martin Gerhardt and Heike Schuster of the University of Bielefeld (Germany). This automaton produces wave patterns that resemble those in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction.|$|E

Besides a pH study of the reaction medium, an infrared spectroscopy (IR) proved the appropriatness of these best conditions of synthesis, and this by showing the {{presence of a}} characteristic peak of the carbonyl grouping situated at 1733 cm- 1 for the copolymer Fucan PMMA in respect to the individual PMMA spectra and Fucan N 1. In addition, a 13 C NMR study has been conducted on the copolymer. A viscosimetry study of two Fucan fractions was performed in aqueous medium (H 20), and also of the obtained copolymer in DMSO. An outcome of this work allows for us the suggestion of a plausible reaction mechanism, of which the copolymerization rate -Rp- is first order dependant to the monomer concentration, and to the square –concentration of both the initiator and the polysaccharide. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This work {{presents}} {{synthesis of}} α,ω-dithienyl terminated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEGTh) capable for further chain extension by either chemical or electrochemical polymeriztion. PEGTh {{was characterized by}} FTIR and 1 H-NMR. Further copolymerization of PEGTh and pyrrole (Py) was performed by chemical oxidative polymerization using <b>ceric</b> (IV) <b>salt</b> as an oxidant (PPy-PEGTh). PEG without end group modification was used directly to prepare copolymers with Py by Ce (IV) salt (PPy-PEG). Block copolymers with mole ratio of pyrrole to PEGTh (PEG) 50 : 1 and 10 : 1 were synthesized. The electrical conductivities of copolymers PPy-PEGTh and PPy-PEG were determined by four point probe technique. Influence of the synthetic route {{and content of the}} insulating segment on conductivity and yield of the copolymers were investigated.
