5|$|Some golden jackals carry {{diseases}} and parasites harmful to human health. These include rabies, and Donovan's Leishmania that is harmless to jackals but may cause leishmaniasis in people. Jackals in southwestern Tajikistan can carry up to 16 species of parasitic cestodes (flatworm), roundworms, and acanthocephalans (thorny-headed worms), these being: Sparganum mansoni, Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, Taenia hydatigena, T.pisiformis, Taenia ovis, Hydatigera taeniaeformis, Dipylidium caninum, Mesocestoides lineatus, Ancylostoma caninum, Uncinaria stenocephala, Dioctophyma renale, Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina, Dracunculus medinensis, Filariata and Macracanthorhynchus catulinum. Jackals infected with Dracunculus medinensis can infect {{bodies of water}} with their eggs, which cause dracunculiasis in people who drink from them. Jackals may also play a large part in spreading <b>coenurosis</b> in sheep and cattle, and canine distemper in dogs. In Tajikistan, jackals carry at least 12 tick species (which include Ixodes, Rhipicephalus turanicus, R. leporis, R. rossicus, R. sanguineus, R. pumilio, R. schulzei, Hyalomma anatolicum, H. scupense and H. asiaticum), four flea species (Pulex irritans, Xenopsylla nesokiae, Ctenocephanlides canis and C. felis), and one species of louse (Trichodectes canis).|$|E

50|$|Although <b>coenurosis</b> is more {{commonly}} associated with domestic animals, {{it has also been}} documented in wildlife. It has been found in mountain ungulates in the French Alps. It is believed that the ungulates are being contaminated by infected sheepdogs. Understanding how this disease is transmitted from sheepdogs to wild animals is important in managing the spread of this potentially dangerous zoonotic disease. A potential management strategy would be for farmers to properly dispose of carcasses that they find on their land. In wild gelada monkeys in Ethiopia, <b>coenurosis</b> was found to affect the fitness of these primates. Mortality increased and fertility was inhibited. The disease has also been documented in wild sheep and other ruminants and rarely documented in rodents, horses, and cats. Very few cases have been identified but this could be due to limited research on wild <b>coenurosis.</b> Animals infected with this disease tend to hide or take cover from predators and therefore may not be seen by humans. However, <b>coenurosis</b> has been known to increase mortality and decrease fertility in wild animal populations.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} consideration in diagnosing <b>coenurosis</b> properly is {{learning about the}} infected person’s exposure history. If the person presenting symptoms lives in an area with poor sanitation, high wild dog population, or known endemic tapeworm, his chance of having <b>coenurosis</b> is much higher. Also, this disease is seen more often in children than adults because children spend time outside {{in the mud and}} generally are more likely than adults to come into contact with canid feces.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coenurosis</b> is a {{parasitic}} infection that results when humans ingest the eggs of dog tapeworm species Taenia multiceps, T. serialis, T. brauni, or T. glomerata.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} are pictures of <b>coenurosis</b> cysts, some {{which have been}} surgically removed from humans and others that {{have been removed from}} animals after death.|$|E
5000|$|T. brauni is endemic only in Africa, and {{the first}} {{reported}} case of African <b>coenurosis</b> (which was probably this particular species) was discovered by Fain and colleagues in 1956.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish {{that there is a}} very significant difference between intestinal human tapeworm infection and human <b>coenurosis.</b> Humans are the definitive hosts for some tapeworm species, the most common being T. saginata and T. solium (beef and pork tapeworms). This means that these species can develop into full grown, reproductively capable adult worms within the human body. People infected with these species have a tapeworm infection. In contrast, the four species that cause human <b>coenurosis</b> can only grow into mature, reproductively capable worms inside their definitive hosts, canids such as dogs, wolves, foxes and coyotes. Humans who ingest eggs from any of these four species of Taenia become intermediate hosts, or places where the eggs can mature into larvae but not into adult worms. When humans ingest these eggs, the eggs develop into tapeworm larvae that group within cysts known as coenuri, which {{can be seen in the}} central nervous system, muscles, and subcutaneous tissues of infected humans. People with <b>coenurosis</b> do not develop a tapeworm infection because the larvae of coenurosis-causing parasites cannot develop into worms inside of humans.|$|E
5000|$|T. glomerata: Even now, it {{is unclear}} whether this species is {{responsible}} for <b>coenurosis</b> in parts of Africa, but it is thought to be. The first reported case caused by this species occurred in Nigeria in 1919.|$|E
5000|$|T. serialis: In 1933 a French {{woman was}} proven to have <b>coenurosis</b> when the cyst {{that had been}} growing under her skin was {{extracted}} from her subcutaneous tissue and fed to a dog, which later developed tapeworm infection due to T. serialis.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{this disease}} so rarely occurs in humans, {{it took a}} long time for it to become {{recognized}} within the population, and species differentiation among the four different types is still somewhat difficult. Many cases of <b>coenurosis</b> probably existed years before it was recognized or discovered, but the first cases to be diagnosed were as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Coenurosis</b> (a.k.a. Caenurosis and Coenuriasis, gid or sturdy in the vernacular) is a {{parasitic}} infection that develops in the intermediate hosts of some tapeworm species (Taenia multiceps, T. serialis, T. brauni, or T. glomerata) and {{are caused by}} the coenurus, the larval stage of these worms. This disease occurs mainly in sheep and other ungulates, but occasionally can occur in humans too by accidental ingestion of worms' eggs.|$|E
50|$|The {{most recent}} North American case {{took place in}} 1994 in Los Angeles, CA, when a 39-year-old man {{presented}} an enlarging mass on his back. When doctors tried to operate a large intramuscular capsule was found. The surgery was terminated, and a fine needle aspiration test revealed muscular <b>coenurosis.</b> The man was treated with praziquantel. The drug successfully killed the larvae and his infection never returned. The cyst removed from this man {{is shown in the}} picture.|$|E
50|$|In 1983, a 4-year-old {{girl in the}} USA was {{admitted}} to the hospital with progressive, generalized muscle weakness, inability to walk, rash, abdominal pain and deteriorating neurological ability. When the doctors did a CT scan, they saw fluid filled lumps in her brain and decided to operate. While operating, coenuri were found and the patient was immediately given chemotherapy with praziquantel. Unfortunately, the <b>coenurosis</b> had already done too much damage in the CNS and the little girl did not survive.|$|E
50|$|Because {{this disease}} is so rare in humans, {{accurate}} diagnostic techniques {{have not been}} developed. CT scans and MRI’s are useful for detecting fluid filled cysts {{in all areas of}} the body, and some serological and microscopic tests can confirm the presence of Taenia larvae once surgery has taken place and a portion of the cyst can be removed to undergo examination and biopsy. Because of the lack of specificity in diagnostic technique, <b>coenurosis</b> can be misdiagnosed as neurocysticercosis or echinococcosis, other parasitic diseases affecting nervous system tissue.|$|E
50|$|The {{definitive}} hosts {{for these}} Taenia species are canids. The adult tapeworms {{live in the}} intestines of animals like dogs, foxes, and coyotes. Intermediate hosts such as rabbits, goats, sheep, horses, cattle and sometimes humans get the disease by inadvertently ingesting tapeworm eggs (gravid proglottids) that have been passed in the feces of an infected canid. This can happen from ingesting food, water or soil that has been contaminated by dog feces. The disease cannot be transmitted from one intermediate host to another, {{but it is still}} {{not a good idea to}} eat meat that presents with cystic nodules from <b>coenurosis.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{infection}} with the metacestode larval form (coenurus) of T. serialis is called <b>Coenurosis.</b> [...] When humans ingest these eggs from definitive host remains, the eggs develop into coenuri. This coenuri {{can occur in}} humans within their muscles, brain, eye, or subcutaneous connective tissue though humans are neither the definitive of intermediate hosts of the T. serialis. [...] The symptoms are variable, and depend on the location and number of larvae. [...] Epsiprantel, praziquantel, fenbendazole and surgical removal are used to combat coenuri infection but discretion should be used when treating this evoloving cestode of medical importance.|$|E
50|$|Jackals {{in southwestern}} Tajikistan have been {{recorded}} to carry 16 species of parasitic cestodes, roundworms and acanthocephalans, these being Sparganum mansoni, Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, Taenia hydatigena, T. pisiformis, T. ovis, Hydatigera taeniaeformis, Diphylidium caninum, Mesocestoides lineatus, Ancylostoma caninum, Uncinaria stenocephala, Dioctophyma renale, Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina, Dracunculus medinensis, Filariata and Macracanthorhynchus catulinum. Jackals infected with D. medinensis can infect water bodies with their eggs, and cause dracunculiasis in people who drink from them. Jackals may also play a large part in spreading <b>coenurosis</b> in sheep and cattle, and canine distemper in dogs. During July 2006, a jackal in Romania {{was found to be}} carrying Trichinella britovi. Jackals consuming fish and molluscs can be infected with metagonimiasis, which was recently diagnosed in a male jackal from northeastern Italy.|$|E
50|$|The {{lifecycle}} of <b>coenurosis</b> {{goes something}} like this: Eggs and gravid proglottids are shed in feces into the environment by infected definitive hosts (canids). Many animals may serve as intermediate hosts, including rodents, rabbits, cattle, sheep, goats and humans. These intermediate hosts ingest the eggs. Once ingested, the eggs hatch in the intestine, releasing oncospheres. These oncospheres circulate in the blood until they lodge in suitable organs (skeletal muscle, eyes, brain, muscles or subcutaneous tissue). After about three months or so, the oncospheres develop into cystic like larvae balls called coenuri. The cycle perpetuates when a canid (definitive host) ingests the tissue of an infected imtermediate host. When this happens, the maturing larvae reside in the small intestine of the definitive host until they mature into adult worms and begin producing eggs (which will eventually be passed through feces into the environment once again).|$|E
50|$|This {{disease is}} very rare in humans and only about 100 cases have ever been recorded. It is a more common problem in sheep and cattle and can be {{problematic}} for farmers in endemic regions of the world. Most human cases occur in developing countries such as India and Sub Saharan Africa where the dog population is not controlled or treated for tapeworm, and in areas lacking proper sanitation. T. multiceps {{has been reported in}} regions all over the world (both human and animal infections) and is the most common <b>coenurosis</b> causing species. T. serialis has been seen in North America, Europe and Africa, and T. brauni and T. glomerata have only been seen in Africa. This disease still occurs, even in developed countries. Some of the most recent reported cases occurred in France, Italy, Israel, Canada and the United States. Some experts suspect under reporting of this disease, especially in impoverished and developing countries where reporting technologies are more difficult to obtain. The global prevalence might be much higher than present data suggest.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cerebral <b>coenurosis</b> {{is caused}} by Coenurus cerebralis, the larval stage of Taenia multiceps. The metacestode causes severe lesions {{in the brain and}} spinal cord of the {{intermediate}} host, so-called “gid ” or “stagger ” disease. Whereas, the non-cerebral <b>coenurosis</b> caused by Coenurus gaigeri, the larval stage of Taenia gaigeri, particularly affects goats. The cyst form of the Taenia gaigeri is found in intramuscular and subcutaneous tissues. The difference in the sequence of mitochondrial genes of cox 1 and nadI and also other variations reported for clinical, morphological and pathological aspects in <b>coenurosis</b> lead to the hypothesis that there is genetic intraspecific variability within this species, such as in other members of the genus Taenia. Nevertheless, {{it has been shown that}} sheep and goats have been infected by both cerebral and non-cerebral <b>coenurosis</b> and it has been suggested that such cerebral and non-cerebral metacestodes may belong to different species of Taenia which are host specific for these hosts...|$|E
