The building was designed by George Willis, engineered by M.L. Diver, and constructed by L.T. Wright and Company.

5|$|Iron {{and steel}} are used widely in the {{construction}} of roads, railways, other infrastructure, appliances, and buildings. Most large modern structures, such as stadiums and skyscrapers, bridges, and airports, are supported by a steel skeleton. Even those with a <b>concrete</b> <b>structure</b> employ steel for reinforcing. In addition, it sees widespread use in major appliances and cars. Despite growth in usage of aluminium, it is still the main material for car bodies. Steel is used in a variety of other construction materials, such as bolts, nails, and screws and other household products and cooking utensils.|$|E

40|$|Many <b>concrete</b> <b>structures</b> and {{elements}} of concrete infrastructure have exceeded their original design lives and are deteriorating {{to an extent}} where they are becoming dangerous. The deterioration can be internal or not obvious and therefore only shows up with detailed testing. Non-destructive evaluation of reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>structures,</b> Volume 1 : Deterioration processes and standard test methods reviews the processes of deterioration and classical and standard test methods.

30|$|There {{existing}} {{a number}} of non-destructive inspection techniques for <b>concrete</b> <b>structures</b> which give some rough sketches of the interior structure, few of them provides concrete and complete interior information of <b>concrete</b> <b>structures.</b> A few years ago, the X-ray computerized tomography (CT for short) for <b>concrete</b> <b>structures</b> being practicalized, it costs very expensive {{and the effect of}} the X-rays to human bodies and the environment cannot be ignored.

In view of the above argument, the authors are trying to develop an ultrasonic CT technique for <b>concrete</b> <b>structures.</b> In this paper, as the first step of its development, we study how the ultrasonic waves propagate in <b>concrete</b> <b>structures</b> and pose a problem to develop ultrasonic CT, applying which we propose a non-destructive inspection technique for concrete cover by application of the ultrasonic CT for <b>concrete</b> <b>structures.</b>|$|R
5|$|Since about 1900, the Black Canyon {{and nearby}} Boulder Canyon had been {{investigated}} for their potential {{to support a}} dam that would control floods, provide irrigation water and produce hydroelectric power. In 1928, Congress authorized the project. The winning bid to build the dam was submitted by a consortium called Six Companies, Inc., which began construction on the dam in early 1931. Such a large <b>concrete</b> <b>structure</b> had never been built before, {{and some of the}} techniques were unproven. The torrid summer weather and lack of facilities near the site also presented difficulties. Nevertheless, Six Companies turned over the dam to the federal government on March 1, 1936, more than two years ahead of schedule.|$|E
5|$|The South Stand of the rugby ground {{formed a}} {{complete}} unit with the North Stand of the National Stadium. Now the same {{structure of the}} South Stand of the rugby ground is also physically attached to the North Stand of the Millennium Stadium. This section is known colloquially as Glanmor's Gap, after Glanmor Griffiths, former chair and President of the WRU. This came about because the WRU were unable to secure enough funding to include the North Stand in the Millennium Stadium, and the National Lottery Commission would not provide any additional funds {{to be used for}} the construction of a new ground for Cardiff RFC. The Millennium Stadium was therefore built with the old reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>structure</b> of the National Stadium (North Stand) and the new steel Millennium Stadium structure built around it.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain a more {{controlled}} durability and long-term performance of <b>concrete</b> <b>structures</b> in chloride containing environment special care is needed in the design phase of reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>structures.</b> The recent development of probability-based procedures has proven to give a more realistic basis for both durability design and condition assessment of reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>structures.</b> Although {{there is still a}} lack of relevant data, this approach has been successfully applied to several new <b>concrete</b> <b>structures,</b> where requirements to a more controlled durability and service life have been specified. Since parameters both for concrete durability and environmental exposure typically show a high scatter, a probability-based approach has shown to give a very powerful basis for durability analysis. This approach is primarily being applied for obtaining a more controlled durability and long-term performance of new <b>concrete</b> <b>structures,</b> but it also provides a very valuable basis for condition assessment of existing <b>concrete</b> <b>structures</b> in chloride containing environment.
