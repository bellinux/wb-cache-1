40|$|Hierarchy plays a {{key role}} in human motor control and learning. We can {{generate}} a variety of structured motor sequences such as writing or speech and learn to combine elemental actions in novel orders. We previously proposed the Modular Selection and Identification for <b>Control</b> (<b>MOSAIC)</b> model to explain the remarkable ability animals show in motor learning, adaptation and behavioral switching. In this paper, we extend this to a hierarchical MOSAIC (HMOSAIC). Each layer of HMOSAIC consists of a MOSAIC, which is a set of paired control and predictive models. The higher-level MOSAIC receives two inputs: an abstract (symbolic) desired trajectory and posterior probabilities of its subordinate level, which represent which modules are playing a crucial role in the lower level under the current behavioral situation. The higher control model generates, as a motor command, prior probabilities for the lower-level modules, and therefore prioritizes which lower-level modules should be selected. In contrast, the higher predictive model learns to estimate the posterior probability at the next time step. The outputs from controllers as well as the learning of both predictors and controllers are weighted by the precision of the prediction. We first show that this bidirectional architecture provides a general framework capable of hierarchical motor learning that is chunking of movement patterns. Then, we discuss the similarities between the HMOSAI...|$|R

It has been designed for the hot neutron diffractometer D 9 with the aim of improving significantly the instrument performance in particular for short wavelengths in the 0. 3 - 0. 9 Å wavelength range. Diamond crystal plates with dimensions of 1. 5 x 1. 5 x 0. 18 cm 3 and an average mosaic spread of 0. 15 ° have been synthesized at the University of Augsburg.

The final performance studies on D 9 showed that the diamond device did not perform better than the original copper crystal.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} MOSAIK-project is to test {{alternative}} {{management systems}} regarding their efficiency in maintaining the characteristic species composition of dry grasslands. We present an integrated landscape model approach to test an alternative management system for applicability in preserving dry grasslands. By rototilling, i. e. cyclic, massive disturbance in the vegetation cover, we established a <b>controlled</b> <b>mosaic</b> cycle comprising a successional series from heavily disturbed areas to grassland and shrubs. The disturbance regime affects the landscape on different temporal and spatial scales. The resulting shifting mosaics determine the habitat qualities for plant and animal species. Changes in habitat quality may reduce the survival of local or regional populations. To predict the local and regional risk of extinction of specific plant and animal functional types, we apply modelling approaches on different scales and levels of hierarchy. We achieve to integrate different modules regarding abiotic and biotic state variables, processes and complex interactions in a spatially explicit way into the MOSAIK landscape model, implementing static as well as dynamic model approaches. The parameters and data necessary for reliable modelling were determined empirically in two study sites in Germany. Subsystems of the overall model are empirically parameterized and validated by means of extensive field surveys. The MOSAIK landscape model is still in development. In this paper we give an overview on the proposed landscape model approach and show the general structure of the MOSAIK landscape model. Preliminary results are exemplified in respect to habitat modelling and economic modelling of two simple management scenarios...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: It is {{proposed}} that (a) creativity and inno-vation {{are the result}} of continuously repetitive pro-cesses of working memory that are learned as cogni-tive control models in the cerebellum, (b) that these cerebellar control models consist of multiple-paired predictor (forward) models within the MOdular Selec-tion and Identification for <b>Control</b> (<b>MOSAIC)</b> and hi-erarchical MOSAIC (HMOSAIC) cerebellar architec-tures that explore and test problem-solving requirements, and (c) when resulting newly formed predictor/controller models are fed forward to more ef-ficiently control the operations of working memory, they lead to creative and innovative problem solving (including the experiences of “insight ” and “intu-ition”). Within this framework, three of Einstein’s clas-sic autobiographical accounts of creative discovery are analyzed. It is concluded that the working mem-ory/cerebellar explanation of creativity and innovation can begin to tie together: (1) behavioral and neuroimaging studies of working memory, (2) behav-ioral, clinical and neuroimaging studies of the cogni-tive functions of the cerebellum, and (3) autobiograph-ical accounts of creativity. It is suggested that newly developed electromagnetic inverse techniques will be a necessary complement to functional brain imaging studies to further establish the validity of the theory. Elsewhere, Vandervert (2003 a, 2003 b) sketched a pre-liminary theory of how mathematical discovery, cre-ativity and innovation arise through the collaboration of working memory and the cognitive functions of the cerebellum. Working memory may be thought of as the “online ” cognitive consciousness through which one acquires new knowledge, solves problems and formu-lates and acts on current goals (e. g., Baddeley, 1992...|$|R
40|$|Humans {{demonstrate}} a remarkable {{ability to generate}} accurate and appropriate motor behavior under many different and often uncertain environmental conditions. We previously proposed a new modular architecture, the modular selection and identi�cation for <b>control</b> (<b>MOSAIC)</b> model, for motor learning and control based on multiple pairs of forward (predictor) and inverse (controller) models. The architecture simultaneously learns the multiple inverse models necessary for control {{as well as how}} to select the set of inverse models appropriate for a given environment. It combines both feedforward and feedback sensorimotor information so that the controllers can be selected both prior to movement and subsequently during movement. This article extends and evaluates the MOSAIC architecture in the following respects. The learning in the architecture was implemented by both the original gradient-descent method and the expectation-maximizatio n (EM) algorithm. Unlike gradient descent, the newly derived EM algorithm is robust to the initial starting conditions and learning parameters. Second, simulations of an object manipulation task prove that the architecture can learn to manipulate multiple objects and switch between them appropriately. Moreover, after learning, the model shows generalization to novel objects whose dynamics lie within the polyhedra of already learned dynamics. Finally, when each of the dynamics is associated with a particular object shape, the model is able to select the appropriate controller before movement execution. When presented with a novel shape-dynamic pairing, inappropriate activation of modules is observed followed by on-line correction...|$|R

40|$|A high {{resolution}} <b>controlled</b> <b>mosaic</b> of the hemisphere of Io centered on longitude 310 degrees is produced. Digital cartographic techniques were employed. Approximately 80 Voyager 1 clear and blue filter frames were utilized. This mosaic was merged with low-resolution color images. This dataset {{is compared to}} the geologic map of this region. Passage of the Voyager spacecraft through the Io plasma torus during acquisition of the highest resolution images exposed the vidicon detectors to ionized radiation, resulting in dark-current buildup on the vidicon. Because the vidicon is scanned from top to bottom, more charge accumulated toward {{the bottom of the}} frames, and the additive error increases from top to bottom as a ramp function. This ramp function was removed by using a model. Photometric normalizations were applied using the Minnaert function. An attempt to use Hapke's photometric function revealed that this function does not adequately describe Io's limb darkening at emission angles greater than 80 degrees. In contrast, the Minnaert function accurately describes the limb darkening up to emission angles of about 89 degrees. The improved set of discrete camera angles derived from this effort will be used in conjunction with the space telemetry pointing history file (the IPPS file), corrected on 4 or 12 second intervals to derive a revised time history for the pointing of the Infrared Interferometric Spectrometer (IRIS). For IRIS observations acquired between camera shutterings, the IPPS file can be corrected by linear interpolation, provided that the spacecraft motions were continuous.

40|$|Humans {{have the}} ability to learn novel motor tasks while {{manipulating}} the environment. Several models of motor learning have been proposed in the literature, but few of them address the problem of retention and interference ofmotor memory. The modular selection and identification for <b>control</b> (<b>MOSAIC)</b> model, originally proposed by Wolpert and Kawato, {{is one of the most}} relevant contributions; it suggests a possible strategy on how the human motor control system learns and adapts to novel environments. MOSAIC employs the concept of forward and inverse models. The same group later proposed the hidden Markov model (HMM) MOSAIC, which affords learning multiple tasks. The significant drawback of this second approach is that the HMM must be trained with a complete data set that includes all contexts. Since the number of contexts or modules is fixed from the onset, this approach does not afford incremental learning of new tasks. In this letter, we present an alternative architecture to overcome this problem, based on a nonparametric regression algorithm, named locally weighted projection regression (LWPR). This network structure develops according to the contexts allowing incremental training. Of notice, interaction force is used to disambiguate among different contexts. We demonstrate the capability of this alternative architecture with a simulated 2 degree-of-freedom representation of the human arm that learns to interact with three distinct objects, reproducing the same test paradigm of the HMM MOSAIC. After learning the dynamics of the three objects, the LWPR network successfully learns to compensate for a novel velocity-dependent force field. Equally important, it retains previously acquired knowledge on the interactionwith the three objects. Thus, this architecture allows both incremental learning of new tasks and retention of previously acquired knowledge, a feature of human motor learning and memory.

However, these two switching models alone seem unable to {{capture the essence of}} learned skills, learning behaviour and the occurrence of errors (cf. Diedrichsen et al., 2005; Thoroughman et al., 1999). In this poster, a novel hierarchical control architecture for switching internal models is proposed.

Storey and Nichols (1938), two English scientists working in Tanzania, at that time called Tanganika, discovered this resistance. They successfully transferred this gene from the wild to the cultivated species, through simple interspecific hybridization. The hybrid was so productive and resistant to mosaic virus that it saved cassava cultivation throughout East Africa. It contin-ues to be a classic example of how genetic resources in the wild can be used for crop improve-ment...|$|R
40|$|Presented {{review of}} rose diseases, {{associated}} with the mosaic symptoms, includes common and yellow rose mosaic, rose ring pattern, rose X disease, rose line pattern, yellow vein mosaic and rose mottle mosaic disease. Based on symptomatology and graft transmissibility of causing agent many of those rose disorders are called "virus-like diseases" since the pathogen has never been identified. However, several viruses were detected and identified in roses expressing mosaic symptoms. Currently the most prevalent rose viruses are Prunus necrotic ringspot virus - PNRSV, Apple mosaic virus - ApMV (syn. Rose mosaic virus) and Arabis mosaic virus - ArMV Symptoms and damages caused by these viruses are described. Tomato ringspot virus, Tobacco ringspot virus and Rose mottle mosaic virus are also mentioned as rose pa thogcns. Methods of <b>control</b> of rose <b>mosaic</b> diseases are discussed...|$|R
