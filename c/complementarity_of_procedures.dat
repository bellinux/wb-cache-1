A strategy of using successively smoothing procedures based on cubic-spline interpolation, averaging processes and Fourier transformation at various stages in SGTM is proposed. The mathematical basis of SGTM and the strategy of invoking various smoothing procedures are discussed. Application of this strategy is demonstrated on experimental data from a liquid crystal and &-amine adducts at the interface between air and water. PACS. 61. 19. -i- X-ray diffraction and scattering.

Using a survey of St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri meat consumers, this study investigates perceptions of and willingness-to-pay for various value-added attributes that could be supplied as retail branded beef products. Factor analysis identifies two alternative attribute bundles as branding strategies based on perceived importance and <b>complementarity</b> <b>of</b> attributes. Nonparametric <b>procedures</b> provide conservative estimates of willingness-to-pay.

40|$|This article {{critically}} {{assesses the}} concept <b>of</b> the <b>complementarity</b> <b>of</b> means, {{a concept that}} underpins the ‘holistic justice’ turn in postconflict policy making. Our concern is with how global transitional justice strategies are being informed by a compelling but vague ideal of institutional cooperation. Drawing on research into Sierra Leone's ‘two tracks’ of transitional justice, we argue that political interaction between the two mechanisms and a contentious, ad hoc learning process between the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission were crucial {{to the way the}} <b>complementarity</b> <b>of</b> means has come to underpin the holistic justice agenda. We caution that by treating the <b>complementarity</b> <b>of</b> means as a mechanical outcome of the mere existence of separate transitional justice mechanisms, global policy makers have drawn the wrong empirical lessons from Sierra Leone. Political engagement {{played a central role in}} constructing a pragmatic partnership between the competing institutions, and in accounting for some of the long-term and unintended consequences of transitional justice. We argue that if a <b>complementarity</b> <b>of</b> means is to be effectively realized global policy makers need to embrace – rather than deny – the politics of holistic justice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Combination of {{different}} speech recognition {{systems can be}} powerful technique to improve recognition performance. The success of these techniques, however, depends on the <b>complementarity</b> <b>of</b> the combined systems. In this paper, a measure <b>of</b> <b>complementarity</b> <b>of</b> different recognition systems is proposed. This measure is based on analysis of similarity of errors made by individual systems. High correlation between the measure and actual performances of combined systems is shown in experiments, which indicates that the measure {{can be used to}} select systems suitable for combination. The measure can be computed very efficiently and it can be used even in situations where exhaustive search looking for the set of system optimal for combination would be infeasible. ...|$|R
