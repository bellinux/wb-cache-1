5000|$|A {{negative}} {{aspect is}} the maintenance and short life {{problems caused by}} the commutator, as well as electromagnetic interference (EMI) issues due to any sparking. Because of the relatively high maintenance <b>commutator</b> <b>brushes,</b> universal motors are best-suited for devices such as food mixers and power tools which are used only intermittently, and often have high starting-torque demands.|$|E
50|$|These are {{single-phase}} AC-only motors {{with higher}} starting torque {{than could be}} obtained with split-phase starting windings, before high-capacitance (non-polar, relatively high-current electrolytic) starting capacitors became practical. They have a conventional wound stator as with any induction motor, but the wire-wound rotor is much like that with a conventional <b>commutator.</b> <b>Brushes</b> opposite each other are connected to each other (not to an external circuit), and transformer action induces currents into the rotor that develop torque by repulsion.|$|E
50|$|A high-torque, {{insulated}} electric motor, usually {{rated at}} 250-750 W (⅓ to 1 horsepower) for a domestic unit, spins a circular turntable mounted horizontally above it. Induction motors rotate at 1,400-1,800 rpm {{and have a}} range of starting torques, depending on the method of starting used. The added weight and size of induction motors may be of concern, depending on the available installation space and construction of the sink bowl. Universal motors rotate at higher speeds (about 2,800 rpm), have high starting torque, and are usually lighter, but are noisier than induction motors, partially due to the higher speeds and partially because the <b>commutator</b> <b>brushes</b> rub on the slotted commutator. Contaminated water leaking on to the commutator can lead to major damage, which is why most garbage disposals today use induction motors. The higher starting torque of those appliances with a permanent magnet motor ensures in most cases {{that there will be no}} blockage.|$|E

50|$|A {{spring is}} {{typically}} {{used with the}} brush, to maintain constant contact with the <b>commutator.</b> As the <b>brush</b> and <b>commutator</b> wear down, the spring steadily pushes the brush downwards towards the <b>commutator.</b> Eventually the <b>brush</b> wears small and thin enough that steady contact {{is no longer possible}} or it is no longer securely held in the brush holder, and so the brush must be replaced.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a second}} problem with this simple pole design. At the zero-torque position, both <b>commutator</b> <b>brushes</b> are {{touching}} (bridging) both commutator plates, resulting in a short-circuit. The power leads are shorted together through the commutator plates, and the coil is also short-circuited through both brushes (the coil is shorted twice, once through each brush independently). Note that this problem is independent of the non-starting problem above; {{even if there were}} a high current in the coil at this position, there would still be zero torque. The problem here is that this short uselessly consumes power without producing any motion (nor even any coil current.) In a low-current battery-powered demonstration this short-circuiting is generally not considered harmful. However, if a two-pole motor were designed to do actual work with several hundred watts of power output, this shorting could result in severe commutator overheating, brush damage, and potential welding of the brushes—if they were metallic—to the commutator. Carbon brushes, which are often used, would not weld. In any case, a short like this is very wasteful, drains batteries rapidly and, at a minimum, requires power supply components to be designed to much higher standards than would be needed just to run the motor without the shorting.|$|E

40|$|Ever {{since its}} development, the {{induction}} motor has been mainly used for constant speed application. Three phase squirrel cage induction motors {{have been widely}} preferred due to simplicity, robustness and maintenance free operation. However, in variable speed applications, preference is always given to dc motors. The reason for using separately exited dc motor as a variable speed drives is the simplicity in control as {{the field and the}} armature current are electrically decoupled from each other.

40|$|The {{epidemics}} {{of obesity}} and diabetes most apparent {{in recent years}} had their origins with Thomas Edison’s development of distributed electricity in New York City in 1882. His original direct current (DC) generators suffered serious <b>commutator</b> <b>brush</b> arcing which is {{a major source of}} high-frequency voltage transients (dirty electricity). From the onset of the electrical grid, electrified populations have been exposed to dirty electricity. Diesel generator sets are a major source of dirty electricity today and are used almost universally to electrify small islands and places unreachable by the conventional electric grid. This accounts for the fact that diabetes prevalence, fasting plasma glucose and obesity are highest on small islands and other places electrified by generator sets and lowest in places with low levels of electrification like sub-Saharan Africa and east and Southeast Asia...|$|R
50|$|Electronically commutated (EC) motors are {{electric}} motors powered by direct-current (DC) electricity and having electronic commutation systems, rather than mechanical <b>commutators</b> and <b>brushes.</b> The current-to-torque and frequency-to-speed relationships of BLDC motors are linear.

25|$|Without a {{commutator}} to wear out, {{the life}} of a BLDC motor can be significantly longer compared to a DC motor using <b>brushes</b> and a <b>commutator.</b> Commutation also tends to cause a great deal of electrical and RF noise; without a <b>commutator</b> or <b>brushes,</b> a BLDC motor may be used in electrically sensitive devices like audio equipment or computers.|$|R
50|$|Despite their names, both 'DC generators' (or 'dynamos') and 'alternators' {{initially}} produce alternating current. In {{a so-called}} 'DC generator', this AC current is {{generated in the}} rotating armature, and then converted to DC by the <b>commutator</b> and <b>brushes.</b> In an 'alternator', the AC current is generated in the stationary stator, and then is converted to DC by the rectifiers (diodes).|$|R

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the {{development}} of high-power variable-frequency/variable-voltage (VVVF) drives, or [...] "traction inverters," [...] has allowed the use of polyphase AC traction motors, thus also eliminating the motor <b>commutator</b> and <b>brushes.</b> [...] The result is a more efficient and reliable drive that requires relatively little maintenance and is better {{able to cope with}} overload conditions that often destroyed the older types of motors.|$|R
25|$|The printed {{armature}} (originally {{formed on}} {{a printed circuit}} board) in a printed armature motor is made from punched copper sheets that are laminated together using advanced composites to form a thin rigid disc.

5000|$|The {{contact point}} where a <b>brush</b> touches the <b>commutator</b> is {{referred}} to as the commutating plane. To conduct sufficient current to or from the <b>commutator,</b> the <b>brush</b> contact area is not a thin line but instead a rectangular patch across the segments. Typically the brush is wide enough to span 2.5 commutator segments. This means that two adjacent segments are electrically connected by the brush when it contacts both.|$|R
40|$|Carbon fiber is an {{emerging}} material in electrical and electronics industry. It {{has been used}} as contact in many applications, such as switch, potentiometer, and <b>commutator</b> <b>brush.</b> A new technique of electronics interconnect is developed, with carbon fiber as a conductive medium. This carbon fiber interconnect can provide interconnection between two planes in different levels of electronics packaging, from semiconductor die, substrate, packaged component to printed circuit board. For example, it can provide a separable interconnect between a land grid array (LGA) or ball grid array (BGA) IC package to a printed circuit board, as an LGA or BGA socket. The interconnect device consists of an array of contact pins. Each contact pin consists {{of a large number of}} carbon fibers which can act cooperatively to provide a high degree of reliability and predictability to the interconnect function. A nickel coating can be applied over carbon fibers to enhance its conductivity and solderability. Analytical evaluations and experimental mechanical and electrical characterizations have been conducted to conclude that the carbon fiber interconnect is a promising interconnect technique...|$|R
50|$|Universal motors {{have high}} {{starting}} torque, can run at high speed, and are lightweight and compact. They {{are commonly used}} in portable power tools and equipment, {{as well as many}} household appliances. They're also relatively easy to control, electromechanically using tapped coils, or electronically. However, the <b>commutator</b> has <b>brushes</b> that wear, so they are much less often used for equipment that is in continuous use. In addition, partly because of the commutator, universal motors are typically very noisy, both acoustically and electromagnetically.|$|R
50|$|The {{softness}} of carbon brushes permits direct radial end-contact with the commutator without {{damage to the}} segments, permitting easy reversal of rotor direction, without the need to reorient the brush holders for operation in the opposite direction. Although never reversed, common appliance motors that use wound rotors, <b>commutators</b> and <b>brushes</b> have radial-contact brushes. In {{the case of a}} reaction-type carbon brush holder, carbon brushes may be reversely inclined with the commutator so that the commutator tends to push against the carbon for firm contact.|$|R
50|$|A {{repulsion}} motor {{is a type}} of electric motor for using on alternating current (AC). It was formerly used as a traction motor for electric trains (e.g. SR Class CP and SR Class SL electric multiple units) but has been superseded by other types of motors. Repulsion motors are classified under single phase motors. In {{repulsion motor}}s the stator windings are connected directly to the AC power supply and the rotor is connected to a <b>commutator</b> and <b>brush</b> assembly, similar to that of a direct current (DC) motor.|$|R
2500|$|Originally, the {{traction}} motors and generator were DC machines. Following {{the development of}} high-capacity silicon rectifiers in the 1960s, the DC generator was replaced by an alternator using a diode bridge to convert its output to DC. This advance greatly improved locomotive reliability and decreased generator maintenance costs by elimination of the <b>commutator</b> and <b>brushes</b> in the generator. [...] Elimination of the <b>brushes</b> and <b>commutator,</b> in turn, disposed {{of the possibility of}} a particularly destructive type of event referred to as a flashover, which could result in immediate generator failure and, in some cases, start an engine room fire.|$|R
5000|$|No longer {{satisfied}} with simply making motors for toys {{and determined to}} break into markets for high tech consumer goods, Kenichi and Takaichi continually improved upon the F-type motor. They increased the precision of the shaft and improved the <b>commutator</b> and <b>brush,</b> reducing noise and power consumption to 10% of the original F-type motor and axis deviation to less than 10 microns, and extending lifespan by 50-100 times to 1,000-2,000 hours. In January 1960, the [...] "FM-250 motor" [...] was born, and, in April, high-precision [...] "RM type" [...] small electric motors were developed, leading Mabuchi into the audio equipment and timepiece markets.|$|R
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the electric powered U.S. Mark 18 torpedo, ethyl alcohol was no longer required for torpedoes; however, limited quantities of denatured alcohol were (and are) still required by the Electrician's Mates and Interior Communications Electricians on board ship for the purpose of cleaning slip rings, <b>commutators,</b> and carbon <b>brushes</b> {{on a wide variety of}} equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Practical commutators have {{at least}} three contact segments, to prevent a [...] "dead" [...] spot where two brushes {{simultaneously}} bridge only two <b>commutator</b> segments. <b>Brushes</b> are made wider than the insulated gap, to ensure that brushes are always in contact with an armature coil. For commutators with at least three segments, although the rotor can potentially stop {{in a position where}} two commutator segments touch one brush, this only de-energizes one of the rotor arms while the others will still function correctly. With the remaining rotor arms, a motor can produce sufficient torque to begin spinning the rotor, and a generator can provide useful power to an external circuit.|$|R
2500|$|A major {{turning point}} in the {{development}} of DC machines took place in 1864, when Antonio Pacinotti described {{for the first time the}} ring armature with its symmetrically grouped coils closed upon themselves and connected to the bars of a <b>commutator,</b> the <b>brushes</b> of which delivered practically non-fluctuating current. The first commercially successful DC motors followed the invention by Zénobe Gramme who, in 1871, reinvented Pacinotti's design.

5000|$|An early {{example of}} {{electromagnetic}} rotation {{was the first}} rotary machine built by Istvan Jedlik with electromagnets and a commutator, in 1826-27. Other pioneers {{in the field of}} electricity include Hippolyte Pixii who built an alternating current generator in 1832, and William Ritchie's construction of an electromagnetic generator with four rotor coils, a <b>commutator</b> and <b>brushes,</b> also in 1832. Development quickly included more useful applications such as Moritz Hermann Jacobi's motor that could lift 10 to 12 pounds with a speed of one foot per second, about 15 watts of mechanical power in 1834.

5000|$|The pancake motor, {{as used in}} slot cars, {{is a type of}} {{electric}} motor, which has a flat commutator and vertical shaft. It was a feature of the highly successful Aurora HO slot cars of the 1960s and 1970s. The motor was not a separate unit; instead, its individual elements - magnets, armature, <b>commutator</b> and <b>brushes</b> - fit into recesses in the blocky chassis. The power was carried by a chain of spur gears {{along the top of the}} chassis, to a pinion which drove a crown gear at the axle. Like most slot car motors, the Aurora pancakes ran on low voltage direct current.The term 'pancake' is also loosely used to refer to a car or chassis which has such a motor.|$|R
50|$|Repulsion motors {{are based}} on the {{principle}} of repulsion between two magnetic fields. Consider a 2-pole salient pole motor with a vertical magnetic axis. The armature is connected to a <b>commutator</b> and <b>brushes.</b> The brushes are short circuited using a low-resistance jumper.When alternating current is supplied to the field (stator) winding, it induces an electromotive force (emf) in the armature. The direction of alternating current is such that it creates a north pole at the top and a south pole at the bottom. The direction of induced emf is given by Lenz's law, according to which the direction of induced emf opposes the cause producing it. The induced emf induces current in the armature conductors and the direction of the induced current depends on the position of the brushes.|$|R
50|$|Polyphase {{power is}} {{particularly}} useful in AC motors, {{such as the}} induction motor, where it generates a rotating magnetic field. When a three-or-more-phase supply completes one full cycle, the magnetic field of a two-poles-per-phase motor has rotated through 360° in physical space; motors with more than two poles per phase require more power supply cycles to complete one physical revolution of the magnetic field and so these motors run slower. Induction motors using a rotating magnetic field were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla and developed in a three-phase form by Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky in 1889. Previously all commercial motors were DC, with expensive <b>commutators,</b> high-maintenance <b>brushes</b> and characteristics unsuitable for operation on an alternating current network. Polyphase motors are simple to construct, are self-starting and have little vibration compared with single-phase motors.|$|R
50|$|Alternators {{have several}} {{advantages}} over direct-current generators. They are lighter, cheaper and more rugged. They use slip rings providing greatly extended brush life over a <b>commutator.</b> The <b>brushes</b> in an alternator carry only excitation current, {{a small fraction}} of the current carried by the brushes of a DC generator, which carry the generator's entire output. A set of rectifiers (diode bridge) is required to convert AC to DC. To provide direct current with low ripple, a three-phase winding is used and the pole-pieces of the rotor are shaped (claw-pole) to produce a waveform similar to a square wave instead of a sinusoid. Automotive alternators are usually belt-driven at 2-3 times crankshaft speed. The alternator runs at various RPM (which varies the frequency) since it is driven by the engine. This is not a problem because the alternating current is rectified to direct current.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{search for}} {{replacement}} of <b>commutator</b> and <b>brushes</b> in conventional DC motors by electronic commutator {{has resulted in}} a class of Permanent Magnet Brush Less (PMBL) motors. The operation of PMBL motor requires synchronization of coil currents with the instantaneous rotor position. The applied voltages of higher magnitudes must have same zero crossings as that of speed induced back EMF of the respective stator windings. The complexity of rotor position detection in PMBL motor is overcome by obtaining a replica of stator induced EMF using additional auxiliary stator and rotor. The auxiliary stator winding induced EMF is amplified using Power Operational Amplifier (P-OPAMP) and the output is connected to the main stator winding. The proposed scheme has been tested at laboratory scale and {{has been found to be}} a promising alternative scheme for operation of PMBLDC/AC motors...|$|R
