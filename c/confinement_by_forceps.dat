40|$|ObjectiveTo compare levator ani muscle injury {{rates in}} {{primiparous}} {{women who had}} a forceps delivery owing to fetal distress with women delivered <b>by</b> <b>forceps</b> for second stage arrest; and to compare these injury rates with a historical control group of women who delivered spontaneously. MethodsPrimiparous women who delivered <b>by</b> <b>forceps</b> were recruited retrospectively into 2 groups: forceps for fetal distress with short second stage (25 ± 11 minutes; n = 19); and forceps delivery for second stage arrest (137 ± 26 minutes; n = 19). MR images of the levator ani muscles were compared with a historical control group of women from a previous study who had delivered spontaneously (n = 129). ResultsMajor defect rates were: 42 % for forceps and short second stage; 63 % for forceps and second stage arrest; and 6 % for spontaneous delivery. The odds ratios for major injury were: 11. 0 for forceps and short second stage compared with spontaneous delivery; 25. 9 for forceps and second stage arrest compared with spontaneous delivery; and 2. 3 for forceps and second stage arrest compared with short second stage (P = 0. 07). ConclusionWomen delivered <b>by</b> <b>forceps</b> have {{a higher rate of}} levator ani injury compared with spontaneous delivery controls; the difference between the forceps groups did not reach significance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA man 37 {{years of}} age {{presented}} with frequency and dysuria. Rigid cystoscopy revealed {{the presence of a}} fishhook in the anterior urethra. Initial attempts to remove the fishhook in one piece <b>by</b> <b>forceps</b> or a basket were unsuccessful. The fishhook was cut into two pieces using a holmium laser via a 9 -Fr ureteroscope and removed <b>by</b> <b>forceps.</b> The anterior urethra experienced a minor tear during the procedure. He voided well without significant urethral stricture 6 months postoperatively. An open urethrotomy is usually indicated for unsuccessful endoscopic removal of foreign bodies from the male urethra, which often leads to recurrent urethral stricture. The novel use of a holmium laser to facilitate the endoscopic removal of a fishhook from the male urethra may reduce the risk of postoperative urethral stricture...|$|R

40|$|Acute {{otitis media}} after forceps {{delivery}} While running an ambulatory paediatric clinic, {{the mother of}} a crying baby wondered whether forceps delivered babies were more prone to otitis than other babies. To our knowledge, this association has not been reported. But, on the other hand, facial nerve injury is more common among those deliv-ered <b>by</b> <b>forceps</b> 1; it is caused by compression of diploic bone of the mastoid process where the facial nerve is located superficially. 2 It is clear that this kind of extraction applies some pressure over the ear of the baby. The head vulnerability is well known: long term con-sequences have been recognised after mild head injury. 3 To estimate the differences of proportion of acute otitis media (AOM) between children delivered <b>by</b> <b>forceps</b> and other babies we conducted an electronic medical records review of all singleton children attending a primary care paediatric clinic, born full ter...|$|R

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{variability}} and systematic differences in polyp measurements on optical colonoscopy and CT colonography. Gastroenterologists measured 51 polyps <b>by</b> visual estimation, <b>forceps</b> comparison and linear probe. CT colonography observers randomly assessed polyp size two-dimensionally (abdominal and intermediate window) and three-dimensionally (manually and semi-automatically). Linear mixed models {{were used to}} assess the variability and systematic differences between CT colonography and optical colonoscopy techniques. The variability of forceps and linear probe measurements was comparable and both showed less variability than measurement by visual assessment. Measurements by linear probe were 0. 7 mm smaller than measurements by visual assessment or <b>by</b> <b>forceps.</b> The variability of all CT colonography techniques was lower than for measurements <b>by</b> <b>forceps</b> or visual assessment and sometimes lower (only 2 D intermediate window and manual 3 D) compared with measurements by linear probe. All CT colonography measurements judged polyps to be larger than optical colonoscopy, with differences ranging from 0. 7 to 2. 3 mm. A linear probe does not reduce the measurement variability of endoscopists compared with the forceps. Measurement differences between observers on CT colonography were usually smaller than at optical colonoscopy. Polyps appeared larger when using various CT colonography techniques than when measured during optical colonoscop...|$|R
