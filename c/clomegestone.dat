50|$|<b>Clomegestone</b> acetate (USAN) (developmental {{code name}} SH-741), or clomagestone acetate, {{also known as}} 6-chloro-17α-acetoxy-16α-methylpregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione, is a steroidal {{progestin}} of the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone group that was developed as an oral contraceptive but was never marketed. It is the acetate ester of <b>clomegestone,</b> which, similarly to <b>clomegestone</b> acetate, was never marketed. <b>Clomegestone</b> acetate is also the 17-desoxy cogener of clometherone, and is somewhat more potent in comparison. Similarly to cyproterone acetate, <b>clomegestone</b> acetate {{has been found to}} alter insulin receptor concentrations in adipose tissue, and this may indicate the presence of glucocorticoid activity.|$|E
