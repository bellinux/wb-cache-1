On May 6, 2015, the company announced that it would [...] "reduce [...] <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> ... to the coal mining industry," [...] i.e. reduce its financing of companies engaging in MTR, coal mining, and coal power production. The company stated that pressure to divest from universities and environmental groups led to this policy change.|$|E
2500|$|Credit default swaps {{are also}} used to {{structure}} synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Instead of owning bonds or loans, a synthetic CDO gets <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> to a portfolio of fixed income assets without owning those assets {{through the use of}} CDS. CDOs are viewed as complex and opaque financial instruments. [...] An example of a synthetic CDO is Abacus 2007-AC1, which is the subject of the civil suit for fraud brought by the SEC against Goldman Sachs in April 2010.

2500|$|The rule distinguishes {{transactions}} by banking entities from transactions by nonbank financial companies {{supervised by}} the Federal Reserve Board. [...] The rule states that in general, [...] "an insured depository institution may not purchase an asset from, or sell an asset to, an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder of the insured depository institution, or any related interest of such person ... unlessâ€” the transaction is on market terms; {{and if the}} transaction represents more than 10 percent of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution, the transaction has been approved in advance {{by a majority of}} the members of the board of directors of the insured depository institution who do not have an interest in the transaction." [...] Providing for the regulation of capital, the Volcker Rule says that regulators are required to impose upon institutions capital requirements that are [...] "countercyclical, so that the amount of capital required to be maintained by a company increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction", to ensure the safety and soundness of the organization. The rule also provides that an insured state bank may engage in a derivative transaction only if the law with respect to lending limits of the state in which the insured state bank is chartered takes into consideration <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> to derivative transactions. The title provides for a three-year moratorium on approval of FDIC deposit insurance received after November 23, 2009, for an industrial bank, a credit card bank, or a trust bank that is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a commercial firm.|$|E

50|$|PFE is {{a measure}} of {{counterparty}} risk/credit risk. It is calculated by evaluating existing trades done against the possible market prices in future during the lifetime of transactions.

40|$|We measure {{systemic}} {{risk in the}} network of financial market infrastructures (FMIs) as the probability that two or more FMIs have a large <b>credit</b> risk <b>exposure</b> to the same FMI participant. We construct indicators of <b>credit</b> risk <b>exposures</b> in three main Canadian FMIs during the period 2007 - 11 and use extreme value methods to estimate this probability. We find large differences in the contribution to {{systemic risk}} across participants. We also find that when participants are in financial distress, they tend to create large <b>credit</b> <b>exposures</b> in two or more FMIs. Our results suggest that an appropriate oversight of FMIs may benefit from an in-depth system-wide analysis, which may have useful implications for the macroprudential regulation of the financial system...|$|R

50|$|The measure {{preferred}} by the Office of the Comptroller is net current <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> (NCCE), which measures {{the risk to}} banks and the financial system in derivatives contracts. The net current <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> (NCCE) of American financial institutions to derivatives {{in the first quarter}} of 2010 to $359 billion or 2.5% of GDP, down from $800 billion at the end of 2008 in the wake of the global financial crisis, when it stood at 5.5% of GDP. The difference between the market value of US derivatives and the <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> to the financial system is due to netting - financial institutions tend to have many positions with their counterparties that have positive and negative values, resulting in a much smaller exposure than the sum of the market values of their derivative positions. Netting reduces the <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> of the US financial system to derivatives by more than 90%, as compared to 50.6% at the beginning of 1998.|$|E

40|$|I {{model the}} {{functioning}} of real-time gross settlement systems for large-value interbank transfers as a linear programming problem in which queueing arrangements, splitting of payments, Lombard loans, and interbank <b>credit</b> <b>exposures</b> arise as primal solutions. Then I use the dual programming problem associated with the maximization of the total flow of payments {{in order to determine}} the shadow-prices of banks in the payment system. We use these shadow-prices to set personalized intraday monetary policies such as reserve requirements, availability of Central Bank credit to temporarily illiquid banks, extension of intraday interbank <b>credit</b> <b>exposures,</b> etc., so as to make the payment system more efficient and less costly in terms of systemic liquidity. The dual approach shows us how to make banks correctly internalize the intraday network externalities they create in the real-time gross settlement system and provides an objective standard for the daily microprudential surveillance of the payment system. ...|$|R
40|$|Under the Basel II banking {{regulatory}} capital regime the capital requirements for <b>credit</b> <b>exposures</b> are calculated using the Asymptotic Single Risk Factor (ASRF) approach. The capital requirement {{is taken to}} be the contribution of an exposure to the unexpected loss on the bank's diversified portfolio. Here we extend this approach to calculate capital requirements for equity investments. We show {{that in the case}} when asset values have a normal distribution an analytical formula for the unexpected loss contribution may be developed. We show that the capital requirements for equity investments are quite different to those of <b>credit</b> <b>exposures,</b> since equity investments can suffer substantial loss of value even when the underlying company has not defaulted. Unexpected loss is commonly used as a measure of capital requirements, but it ignores the ability of earnings to absorb loss. We propose a definition of capital requirement that recognises the expected earnings on assets, and show how to combine the ASRF model and the Capital Asset Pricing Model to compute this quantity for <b>credit</b> and equity <b>exposures.</b> Capital allocation Economic capital Equity Basel II ASRF Factor model CAPM...|$|R

40|$|Counterparty {{credit risk}} {{management}} {{has become an}} important issue for financial institutions since the Basel III framework was introduced. Expected exposure (EE) {{is defined as the}} average (positive) exposure at a future date, it is an essential component in the measurement of counterparty credit risk. This thesis aims to develop an efficient Monte Carlo method to calculate the expected exposures for Asian and barrier options. These options are path-dependent in that their payoffs depend on the historical prices of the underlying assets. Since analytical solutions are generally not available to path-dependent options, the evaluation of the expected exposures has to rely on numerical methods. Monte Carlo method is considered to be more efficient than other methods in particular for high dimension problems. We briefly introduce the concepts and terms regarding <b>credit</b> <b>exposures</b> in the Basel III framework. Then, we introduce Asian and barrier options as well as some basic pricing models. Next, we will extend the optimized least squares Monte Carlo (OLSM) method to calculate the <b>credit</b> <b>exposures</b> for Asian and barrier options and present our numerical results...|$|R

50|$|In trading, {{clearing}} {{is necessary}} because {{the speed of}} trades is much faster than the cycle time for completing the underlying transaction. It involves the management of post-trading, pre-settlement <b>credit</b> <b>exposures</b> to ensure that trades are settled in accordance with market rules, even if a buyer or seller should become insolvent prior to settlement. Processes included in clearing are reporting/monitoring, risk margining, netting of trades to single positions, tax handling, and failure handling.|$|R
