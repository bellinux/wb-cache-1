40|$|Network {{processing}} {{elements in}} virtual machines, {{also known as}} Network Function Virtualization (NFV) often face CPU bottlenecks at the virtualization interface. Even highly optimized paravirtual device interfaces fall short of the throughput requirements of modern devices. Passthrough devices, together with SR-IOV support for multiple device virtual functions (VF) and IOMMU support, mitigate this problem somewhat, by allowing a VM to directly control a device partition bypassing the virtualization stack. However, device passthrough requires high-end (expensive and power-hungry) hardware, places scalability limits on <b>consolidation</b> <b>ratios,</b> and does not support efficient switching between multiple VMs on the same host. We present a paravirtual interface that securely exposes an I/O device directly to the guest OS running inside the VM, and yet allows that device to be securely shared among multiple VMs and the host. Compared to the best-known paravirtualization interfaces, our paravirtual interface supports up to 2 x higher throughput, and is closer in performance to device passthrough. Unlike device passthrough however, we do not require SR-IOV or IOMMU support, and allow fine-grained dynamic resource allocation, significantly higher <b>consolidation</b> <b>ratios,</b> and seamless VM migration.

Even though these computers see little {{use in the}} course of the day, they often remain powered, even when idle. Leaving idle PCs running is not only wasteful, but with rising energy costs it is increasingly more expensive. We propose partial migration of idle desktop sessions into the cloud to achieve energyproportional computing. Partial migration only propagates the small footprint of state that will be needed during idle period execution, and returns the session to the PC when it is no longer idle. We show that this approach can reduce energy usage of an idle desktop by up to 50 % over an hour and by up to 69 % overnight. We show that idle desktop sessions have small working sets, up to an order of magnitude smaller than their allocated memory, enabling significant <b>consolidation</b> <b>ratios.</b> We also show that partial VM migration can save medium to large size organizations tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. ...|$|R

The {{widespread use of}} virtualization and the increasingly high server <b>consolidation</b> <b>ratios,</b> in particular, have introduced unprecedented security challenges for users, increasing the exposure to intrusions and opening up new opportunities for attacks. Deploying security mechanisms in the hypervisor to detect and stop intrusion attempts is a promising strategy to address this problem.

In this paper, we present Slick (Storage-Level Intrusion ChecKer), an intrusion detection system (IDS) for virtualized storage devices. Slick detects intrusion attempts by efficiently and transparently monitoring write accesses to critical regions on storage devices. The low-overhead monitoring component operates entirely inside the hypervisor, with no introspection or modifications required in the guest VMs. Using Slick, users can deploy generic IDS rules to detect {{a broad range of}} real-world intrusions in a flexible and practical way.

40|$|Proactive {{resource}} management involves taking actions to make resources available for upcoming load spikes. Proactive {{resource management}} is highly desirable for managing resources in a multi-tenant cloud {{where it is}} common to have hot-spots at some loca-tions, while still having spare resources scattered throughout the datacenter. Inability to quickly use fragmented spare resources in a datacenter during load spikes causes administrators to do host-level over-provisioning. Running hosts at low utilization leads to lower <b>consolidation</b> <b>ratios</b> directly impacting the bottom-line. In this paper, we present key challenges in doing proactive re-source management in virtualized environments. We argue that many of the building blocks necessary for proactive management are available today – specifically, (a) analytics engines that collect performance metrics and apply sophisticated statistical learning al-gorithms to predict various metrics, including future resource de-mands for hosts, virtual machines (VMs), storage arrays and (b) cluster-level schedulers that react to resource demands and suggest VM migrations for load-balancing. We propose a preliminary solu-tion that combines these building blocks, while handling the hard issue of dealing with mis-predictions. Our key insight is to conduct proactive management only using spare resources without hurting the ongoing workloads. We have validated some of our ideas using a simulation-based evaluation. We hope to inspire further research in this area, making cloud environments more efficient, nimble and adaptive. 1...|$|R
