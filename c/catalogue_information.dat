The liner notes typically {{will be a}} 120 × 120 mm booklet, or a single 242 × 120 mm leaf folded in half.

The back card is folded into a flattened [...] "U" [...] shape, with the sides being visible along the ends (often {{referred to as the}} spine) of the case. The ends usually have the name of the release and the artist, and often label or <b>catalogue</b> <b>information</b> printed on them, and are designed to be visible when the case is stored vertically, 'book-style', on shelves.|$|E
50|$|In 1933 Rider {{returned}} to Middletown {{to take a}} permanent librarianship position at Wesleyan. A year later the university awarded him a Masters ad eundum, Phi Beta Kappa. Subsequently, after becoming director of Wesleyan’s Olin Memorial Library, Rider wrote his most significant work {{on the subject of}} Library Science, The Scholar and The Future of the Research Library (published in 1944). In The Scholar, he laid out the problem of increasing shortage of space in research libraries and described the microcard, a microform of his own invention being a 7 and a half by 12 and a half centimeter opaque card. Upon the catalogue, or front-side, would be the <b>catalogue</b> <b>information.</b> Upon the reverse, Rider wanted to reproduce “as many as 250 pages of an ordinary 12mo book {{on the back of a}} single card.” The idea was inspired by recent developments he had been following in the production and printing of micro-text, especially by the Readex Microprint Corporation. Rider envisioned that these microcards would serve both as the catalogue and collection, thus not only saving shelving space by eliminating books, but also doing away with the need to have a catalogue collection separate from manuscript collection. Researchers would search the catalogue for the entry they wished, and then having selected it would take the card to a reader machine which might be no bigger than a briefcase.|$|E
