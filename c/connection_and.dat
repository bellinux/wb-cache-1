40|$|During {{the last}} 30 years US {{citizens}} experienced, on average, {{a decline in}} reported happiness, social <b>connections,</b> <b>and</b> confidence in institutions. We show that a remarkable portion of the decrease in happiness is predicted by the decline in social <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> confidence in institutions. We carry out our investigation in three steps. First, we run a happiness regression that includes various indicators of social <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> confidence in institutions, alongside with own income, reference income, and the usual socio-demographic controls. We find that indicators of social <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> confidence in institutions are positively and significantly correlated with happiness. Second, we investigate the evolution of social <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> confidence in institutions over time, finding that they generally show a declining trend. Third, we calculate the variation in happiness over time as predicted by each of its statistically significant correlates, finding that the decrease in happiness is mainly predicted by the decline in social <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> by the growth in reference income. More precisely, {{the sum of the}} negative changes in happiness predicted by the reduction in social <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> the increase in reference income more than offsets the positive change predicted by the growth of household income. Also, the reduction in happiness predicted by the decline in confidence in institutions is non-negligible, although substantially smaller than the one predicted by either social connections or reference income...|$|R

5|$|Despite Mitică's {{association}} with Bucharest and his usual most common {{career as a}} state employee, several commentators have recounted {{that he may have}} been based on Gheorghe Matheescu, an entrepreneur from the town of Sinaia (located on the Prahova Valley, in northern Muntenia). Matheescu took pride in this supposed <b>connection,</b> <b>and,</b> around 1939, argued in its favor in front of literary historian Şerban Cioculescu. Cioculescu recorded the rumor, and indicated that it was backed by information received from Caragiale's daughter, Ecaterina Logadi. Her father reportedly enjoyed Matheescu's company, and, in 1901, even authored short advertisements for his store.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, {{the plans}} were revised, with new plans {{such as a}} line to Staten Island and a revised line to the Rockaways. In the late 1940s and 1950s, a Queens Bypass line via the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line was first {{proposed}} as {{a branch of the}} still-planned Second Avenue Subway. In addition, capacity on existing lines would have been improved through the construction of strategic connections such as the Culver Ramp, the 60th Street Tunnel <b>Connection,</b> <b>and</b> the Chrystie Street <b>Connection,</b> <b>and</b> through the rebuilding of DeKalb Avenue Junction. These improvements were the only things to come out of these plans. Eventually, these plans were modified to what became the Program for Action, which was put forth by the New York City Transit Authority in 1968. This was the last plan for a major expansion of the subway system. The plan included the construction of the Second Avenue Subway, a Queens Bypass line, a line replacing the Third Avenue El in the Bronx, and other extensions in the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. While ambitious, very little of the plan was completed, mostly because of the financial crisis during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Feeding almost {{exclusively}} on octopuses and other cephalopods, the Australian weasel shark mostly hunts near the sea floor. It is viviparous, with the developing embryos nourished through a placental <b>connection</b> <b>and</b> born after a six-month gestation period. This species is productive for a shark, with females bearing litters of 1–19 pups usually twice per year. The Australian weasel shark is caught by trawl {{and to a lesser}} extent gillnet and longline fisheries, though not in such numbers that its population is threatened. Thus, it has been listed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigates the}} effects of bank equity <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> {{intellectual}} property protection on enterprises’ innovation behavior, and the regulating effect of intellectual property protection {{on the relationship between}} bank equity <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> innovation. In general, bank equity <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> intellectual property protection not only significantly increase innovation input, but also improve innovation performance. However, the efficiency of bank equity connections is influenced by the heterogeneity of enterprises and the value orientation of the subjects. Bank equity connections have a more significantly positive effect on innovation in private and central enterprises, whereas the principal-agent problem and government intervention may weaken the marginal contribution of bank equity connections to the innovation of local state-owned enterprises. Bank equity <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> intellectual property protection are complementary in promoting enterprise innovation. Not only are the combined effects of bank equity <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> intellectual property protection greater than the individual effects, but when the latter is relatively weak, the former’s positive effect on innovation is obviously weakened and may even crowd out innovation...|$|R
