5|$|In {{terms of}} combat, the game allows players {{to create and}} <b>customise</b> their own move combos in the Combo Lab, which uses four {{categories}} of fighting moves called Pressens. This is done by chaining them together, made possible through earning PMP (Procedural Mastering Power), with a limit of four combos being active at any one time. The Pressen moves are Regen (healing), Power (damage), Chain (duplication and doubling of previous moves) and Cooldown (regeneration of S-Pressen energy). There are 50,000 possible Pressen combinations. Five S-Pressen moves will {{be made available to}} the player {{over the course of the}} game: the moves enable them to do things like stun groups of enemies, move at high speed and land more hits, or turn hostile robots into allies which then self-destruct. Players also have access to projectile-based weapons like the Spammer and Junk Bolt.|$|E

40|$|Existing ontology-related formalisms {{focus on}} either datatypes (such as the OWL datatype formalism) or datatype predicates (such as the {{concrete}} domain approach). Furthermore, they donâ€™t provide a general framework for representing <b>customised</b> datatypes and predicates, which {{is identified as}} a key requirement of ontology languages. In this paper we shall propose a scheme for integrating concept languages with <b>customised</b> datatypes and datatype predicates, based on a formalism called datatype group. The main difference between our approach and the concrete domain approach is that the latter one does not support <b>customised</b> datatypes and datatype predicates. According to Baader and Hanschke [2], the concrete domain approach assumes that datatype constraints are sufficiently structured by datatype predicates; therefore, {{they do not want}} to define new classes of elements of a concrete domain (<b>customised</b> datatypes) or new relations between elements of a concrete domain (<b>customised</b> datatype predicates). Specifically, the concrete domain approach does not support the oneOf constructor that OWL DL requires, which can be used to define simple <b>customised</b> datatypes (called enumerated datatypes) using typed literals...|$|R
5|$|In each level, {{the player}} must {{complete}} certain objectives and then exit the stage. The requirements are varied, with many levels requiring the recovery {{and use of}} numerous high-tech gadgets. If Joanna is killed or fails an objective, the player must start the level again. Three distinct difficulty settings are available for each level, the choice of which will affect aspects such {{as the number of}} objectives that must be completed, enemy accuracy and damage, the effectiveness of the game's optional aiming assistance, and the availability of ammunition and protective shields. If all the levels are completed on the highest difficulty, an additional setting becomes available, allowing players to <b>customise</b> various aspects of enemies, such as their health, their aiming accuracy and the damage they inflict. In addition to the main campaign, there are four bonus missions, with three enabling the player to control other characters with unique special abilities. Players can also unlock cheats by completing the levels within certain time limits.|$|E
5|$|The earguards are in {{the shape}} of silver ears, and the neckguard is {{decorated}} with a scrolling leaf pattern. Six detached cheekpieces were found within the helmet bowl along with the disintegrated remains of a seventh, although only two would have been needed. Hinges were also found, as was the pin of one cheekpiece, which had been bent. It may have been forcibly removed or possibly sustained damage at a later date, perhaps from a plough. It is unclear why there were so many cheekpieces accompanying the helmet; it is possible that they may all have been used on the same helmet to <b>customise</b> its appearance on different occasions, or alternatively they may have been intended as spares in the event of damage. The surviving cheekpieces are very elaborate. Five of the cheekpieces show equestrian scenes; one depicts the triumph of a Roman emperor on horseback, holding his arm in the air as he is crowned with a laurel wreath by the goddess Victoria (Victory). A cowering barbarian is depicted below being trampled by the hooves of the emperor's horse. Another less well-preserved cheekpiece depicts a possibly Middle Eastern figure holding a large cornucopia, and a Roman helmet and shield below.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Although OWL {{is rather}} expressive, {{it has a}} very serious {{limitation}} on datatypes; i. e., it does not support <b>customised</b> datatypes. It has been pointed out that many potential users will not adopt OWL unless this limitation is overcome, and the W 3 C Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment Working Group has set up a task force to address this issue. This paper provides a solution for this issue by presenting two decidable datatype extensions of OWL DL, namely OWL-Eu and OWL-E. OWL-Eu provides a minimal extension of OWL DL to support <b>customised</b> datatypes, while OWL-E extends OWL DL with both <b>customised</b> datatypes and <b>customised</b> datatype predicates. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Foot orthoses {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} {{to be effective in}} the management of a range of conditions, but there is debate as to the benefits of <b>customised</b> foot orthoses over less expensive, prefabricated devices. Methods In a randomised, cross-over trial, 15 flat-footed participants aged between 18 and 45 years were provided with semi-rigid, <b>customised</b> orthoses and semi-rigid, contoured, prefabricated orthoses. Pressures and forces were measured using an in-shoe system with subjects wearing shoes alone, wearing <b>customised</b> orthoses, and again when wearing contoured prefabricated orthoses. Two weeks acclimatisation was included between cross-over of therapy. Repeated measures ANOVA models with post-hoc, pair-wise comparisons were used to test for differences. Results When compared to wearing shoes alone, wearing either the <b>customised</b> orthoses or the prefabricated orthoses was associated with increases in force and force time integrals in the midfoot region. Peak and maximum mean pressure and pressure-time, and force-time integrals were reduced in both the medial and lateral forefoot. There were, however, {{no significant differences between the}} <b>customised</b> orthoses and the prefabricated orthoses at any site. Conclusion There was a similar change in loading with both the semi-rigid <b>customised</b> and the semi-rigid prefabricated orthoses when compared to the shoe alone condition. However, while <b>customised</b> devices offered minor differences over prefabricated orthoses in some variables, these were not statistically significant. The results suggest that there may be only minor differences in the effects on plantar pressures between the <b>customised</b> and the less expensive prefabricated orthoses tested in this study, however further research is warranted. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. Diabetes in {{pregnancy}} {{is associated with}} both accelerated fetal growth and intrauterine growth restriction. OBJECTIVE. To compare the difference in occurrence of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) fetuses in a pregnant diabetic population using population-based growth charts and <b>customised</b> growth charts. METHODS. Retrospective observational study at Steve Biko Academic and Kalafong hospitals, Pretoria, South Africa. Information from an electronic database was used to retrospectively generate <b>customised</b> centiles using a web-based tool (www. gestation. net). The first fetal growth scan of the third trimester, as determined by ultrasound, was plotted for each patient on both the population-based and <b>customised</b> growth charts. We compared the growth category on the population-based growth chart with that on the <b>customised</b> growth chart. RESULTS. Of the patients, 44 had type 1, 66 type 2 and 173 gestational diabetes. The growth of 79 / 283 fetuses would have been reclassified had <b>customised</b> growth charts been used. Of cases in which fetal growth was classified as appropriate for gestation on the populationbased growth charts, 58 fetuses would have been LGA and 14 SGA had <b>customised</b> growth charts been used. Four of the fetuses that were SGA and three that were LGA on the population-based growth charts would have been classified as appropriately grown on the <b>customised</b> growth charts. This was {{a statistically significant difference}} (p< 0. 001), with a Cohenâ€™s kappa of 0. 45 indicating moderate agreement. CONCLUSIONS. <b>Customised</b> growth charts identified more babies with aberrations of growth, who may need vigilant antenatal care and elective delivery and may be at increased health risk in the future.

40|$|Background: There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} to support the use of <b>customised</b> centile charts to identify those at risk of stillbirth and infant death at term. We sought to determine birth weight thresholds at which mortality and morbidity increased and the predictive ability of noncustomised (accounting for gestational age and sex) and partially <b>customised</b> centiles (additionally accounting for maternal height and parity) to identify fetuses at risk. Methods: This is a population-based linkage study of 979, 912 term singleton pregnancies in Scotland, United Kingdom, between 1992 and 2010. The main exposures were noncustomised and partially <b>customised</b> birth weight centiles. The primary outcomes were infant death, stillbirth, overall mortality (infant and stillbirth), Apgar score &# 60; 7 at 5 min, and admission to the neonatal unit. Optimal thresholds that predicted outcomes for both non- and partially <b>customised</b> birth weight centiles were calculated. Prediction of mortality between non- and partially <b>customised</b> birth weight centiles was compared using area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) and net reclassification index (NRI). Findings: Birth weight â‰¤ 25 th centile was associated with higher risk for all mortality and morbidity outcomes. For stillbirth, low Apgar score, and neonatal unit admission, risk also increased from the 85 th centile. Similar patterns and magnitude of associations were observed for both non- and partially <b>customised</b> birth weight centiles. Partially <b>customised</b> birth weight centiles did not improve the discrimination of mortality (AUROC 0. 61 [95...|$|R
