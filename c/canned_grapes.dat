Leaves from four different variety; Hacitesbihi, Agrazaki, Karaerik, and Kabuguyufka were blanched in two different solutions, and the leaves were placed into jars, then filled with tap water and brine containing 3. 5 percent salt + 1 percent citric acid and stored for 7 months in ambient temperature. The results of chemical and physical analyses showed that quality of the Karaerik leaves was better than that of the other variety leaves. Also, sensory evaluation indicated that Karaerik and Kabuguyufka varieties were the most suitable grape leaves to produce Sarma dish. We conclude that Kabuguyufka and Karaerik leaves are convenient for Sarma dish as canned while Agrazaki and Hacitesbihi as fresh...|$|R
