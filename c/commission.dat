40|$|<b>Commissioning</b> is {{essential}} in plant-modification projects, yet tends to be ad hoc. The issue {{is not so much}} ignorance as lack of systematic approaches. This paper presents a structured model wherein <b>commissioning</b> is systematically integrated with risk management, project management, and production engineering. Three strategies for <b>commissioning</b> emerge, identified as direct, advanced, and parallel. Direct <b>commissioning</b> is the traditional approach of stopping the plant to insert the new unit. Advanced <b>commissioning</b> is the <b>commissioning</b> of the new unit prior to installation. Parallel <b>commissioning</b> is the <b>commissioning</b> of the new unit in its operating position, while the old unit is still operational. Results are reported for two plant case studies, showing that advanced and parallel <b>commissioning</b> can significantly reduce risk. The model presents a novel and more structured way of thinking about <b>commissioning,</b> allowing for a more critical examination of how to approach a particular project...|$|R

40|$|<b>Commissioning</b> {{is gaining}} {{increasing}} {{recognition as a}} cost-effective strategy for reducing commercial building energy use. Although the success and cost-effectiveness of <b>commissioning</b> projects depends on how well the benefits of <b>commissioning</b> persist over time, this aspect of <b>commissioning</b> is not well understood. The persistence of <b>commissioning</b> benefits was recently studied in a PIER project evaluating ten buildings that were <b>commissioned</b> at building start-up {{at least two years}} ago. The researchers examined the <b>commissioning</b> reports, control algorithms, EMCS point measurements, and energy use data, and conducted operator and <b>commissioning</b> provider interviews to investigate the persistence of <b>commissioning</b> benefits. In addition, they conducted site visits in a sample of the buildings. A set of <b>commissioning</b> measures was selected for each building to compare the persistence of benefits. Persistence was measured both qualitatively through a discussion of occupant comfort and decreased maintenance and quantitatively through estimations of energy savings. This paper reports the results of the study. The discussion includes how well the benefits of <b>commissioning</b> persisted over time, reasons for declining performance, and methods for improving persistence. The results provide valuable insight into how to estimate the persistence of <b>commissioning</b> information central to the cost benefit analyses routinely performed for <b>commissioning</b> measures...|$|R

40|$|HVAC systems seldom {{perform as}} {{intended}} under {{the original design}} concept. As a quality-oriented process, <b>commissioning</b> should be conducted regularly or continuously throughout the building lifecycle. Considering labor, time and cost consumed by manual <b>commissioning,</b> automatic <b>commissioning</b> is more competent for lifecycle <b>commissioning.</b> This paper investigates existing techniques for implementing automatic <b>commissioning.</b> It is found that, although many efforts have been put into developing automatic <b>commissioning</b> techniques, sensor validation was always overlooked. Accurate sensor measurements are prerequisite to reliable <b>commissioning.</b> This paper presents a diagnostic tool for automatic <b>commissioning</b> of sensors in typical air-handling units (AHU). The diagnostic tool implements a robust sensor fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) strategy based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method.

In August 1994, Kerry Carrington sent a 17,000-word document and 300 pages of evidence to the Royal <b>Commission</b> into the New South Wales Police Service, asking for the case to be investigated. The <b>commission</b> was headed by Judge James Roland Wood, though a representative for the <b>commission</b> stated that Wood's involvement in Webster's trial would not affect the outcome of any investigation. In December 1994, a representative for the <b>commission</b> said that after thorough consideration, they would not be investigating the matter.|$|E

The <b>commission</b> was highly critical of the army. The chiefs of staff of the army and the Pakistan Air Force were removed from their positions for attempting to interfere with the <b>commission.</b> The <b>Commission</b> based its reports on interviews with politicians, officers and senior commanders. The final reports were submitted in July 1972, but all were subsequently destroyed except for one held by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Pakistani president. The findings were never made public.|$|E
