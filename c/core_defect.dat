40|$|Hollow core {{photonic}} bandgap fibers (HC-PBGFs) are a {{class of}} optical fibers which guide light in a low index core region surrounded by a triangular lattice of air holes separated by a delicate silica web. The precise nature of this cladding structure requires extremely fine control of the fabrication parameters. While HC-PBGFs have found wide range of exciting research applications the initially anticipated potential for ultralow loss below that of single mode fiber (SMF) {{has yet to be}} realized. To date loss figures as low as 1. 7 dB/km have been reported, however surface roughness at the core cladding interface limited further loss reduction. The loss of HC-PBGFs can potentially be decreased further by increasing the core dimensions and through optimisation of the fabrication process. To date, the manufacture of HC-PBGFs is reliant upon the two stage stack and draw process. To target ultralow loss below what has been reported to date it has become necessary to ensure repeatability and uniformity in the labor intensive stack and draw process. Repeatability is ensured through rigorous cleanliness throughout preform preparation and by precise fabrication control at each stage of manufacture.

Greater than 1 km lengths of HC-PBGF (Fig. 1 a) can now be drawn with typical attenuations of the order of 2 - 3 dB/km and with significantly improved optical bandwidth (~ 100 nm) compared with previously reported. These developments open up HC-PBGF for a range of applications such as telecommunications, laser power delivery, gas sensing and strong light matter interactions, for which they have a clear advantage over conventional fibers.

Materials and methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE identified a total of 42 clinical studies that investigated the effects of TZDs (n= 23) and/or metformin (n= 19) on endogenous glucose production (using tracer glucose techniques) and peripheral glucose disposal (using the euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp) in patients with type 2 diabetes (n= 549).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Here we {{investigate}} pathophysiological dimensions (language disturbance, negative symptoms, lateralisation and the continuous performance test) {{in relation to}} ICD- 10 and DSM-IV concepts of diagnosis. METHODS: A total of 32 consecutive psychotic patients {{with at least one}} Schneider's first rank symptom (SFRS), 15 depressed patients without SFRS and 17 normal volunteers were assessed with the Clinical Language Disorder Rating Scale (CLANG), SFRS, "pure defect" Huber's basic symptoms (HBS), handedness (Annett's pegboard task), and the A-X Continuous Performance Test (AX-CPT). RESULTS: CLANG total score (an index of severity of language disorder) was correlated with the severity of SFRS, a higher leftward shift of handedness, and poorer performance on AX-CPT. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that only CLANG and AX-CPT variables had adequate predictive validity in separating cases of ICD- 10 schizophrenia from other diagnoses. The logistic regression model predicting the presence of ICD- 10 schizophrenia was statistically significant using CLANG and AX-CPT variables, but not SFRS or other variables. HBS did not correlate with other variables and did not predict ICD- 10 diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: A cross-sectional diagnosis based on language disturbance and CPT performance yields a diagnostic construct largely overlapping with the ICD- 10 definition of schizophrenia. We suggest that Schneider's first rank symptoms (that play a large role in the DSM-IV concept) can be considered an index of left hemisphere dysconnectivity for language whereas CPT dysfunction reflects dysconnectivity of the right hemisphere for those remoter ("spatial") associations that are closer to Bleuler's <b>core</b> <b>defect</b> and to the chronicity implicit in the ICD definition.

We explore the design of the defect geometry to support well confined accelerating modes in such PBG fibers. The dispersion diagram of an accelerating mode must cross the SOL line, and such modes form a special class of defect modes known as surface modes, which are lattice modes of the original PBG crystal that have been perturbed into the bandgap. The details of the surface boundary separating the defect from the surrounding PBG matrix are found to be the critical ingredients for optimizing the accelerator mode properties...|$|R
