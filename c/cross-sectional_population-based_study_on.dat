40|$|Objective: We {{evaluated}} {{the relation between}} overweight and calcium intake in adults living in the municipality of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: This was a <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>population-based</b> <b>Study</b> <b>on</b> a sample of 1459 adults that was obtained by multistage cluster sampling. Dietary intake {{was measured by the}} 24 -h recall method. Poisson`s and linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relation between overweight and quartiles of calcium intake adjusted for energy. Results: The prevalence of overweight was 43. 1 % and the average adjusted calcium intake was 448. 6 mg. In the linear regression. analyses, the regression coefficient for adjusted calcium was significant and negative (P = 0. 019, beta(1) = - 0. 0001). Although evaluated by quartiles, the prevalence ratio for overweight in the first quartile of calcium intake was 1. 24 (95 % confidence interval 1. 00 - 1. 54) and that in the second quartile was 1. 24 (95 % confidence interval 1. 03 - 1. 49). Conclusion: In the present study, calcium intake showed a significant negative association with body mass index. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{variants}} of Y chromosome predispose to hypertension in rodents, whereas in humans {{the evidence is}} conflicting. Our purpose was to study the distribution of a panel of Y chromosome markers in a cohort from a <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>population-based</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in Poland (WOBASZ study). The HindIII, YAP Y chromosome variants, previously shown to influence blood pressure, lipid traits or height, as well as SNPs defining main Y chromosome haplogroups, were typed in 3026, 2783 and 2652 samples, respectively. In addition, 4 subgroups (N, 100 each) representing extremes of LDL concentration or blood pressure (BP) were typed for a panel of 17 STRs. The HindIII and YAP polymorphism were not associated {{with any of the}} studied traits. Analysis of the haplogroup distribution showed an association between higher HDL level and hg I-M 170 (P = 0. 02), higher LDL level and hg F*(xI-M 170, J 2 -M 172, K-M 9) (P = 0. 03) and lower BMI and hg N 3 -Tat (P = 0. 04). Analysis of STRs did not show statistically significant differences. Since all these associations lost statistical significance after Bonferroni correction, we conclude that a major role of Y chromosome genetic variation (defined by HindIII, YAP or main Y chromosome haplogroups) in determining cardiovascular risk in Poles is unlikely...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The high {{incidence}} of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affecting women in climacteric women has been often ascribed to modifications of body mass composition occurring in these periods of life. In particular, the menopause and aging-related shift from gluteofemoral to abdominal fat distribution has been recognized to contribute in promoting an atherogenic lipid profile, increasing peripheral insuline resistence and endothelian dysfunction. Nevertheless, little is still known about the possible influence of fat deposit localization and biomarkers of inflammation, plasmatic lipids and oxidative stress (OS), i. e. well documented CVD risk factors. OBJECTIVES: to evaluate whether body fat distribution influences OS, plasmatic lipids and inflammation in peri- and post-menopausal women. METHODS: We carried out a <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>population-based</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> 101 women, of which 32 % in perimenopause and 68 % in postmenopause, aged 45 - 71 years. Body mass composition was assessed in all subjects by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Besides, blood level of hydroperoxides (Hy), total antioxidants, uric acid (UA), thiols, triglycerides (TRI) and total, LDL- (C-LDL) and HDL-cholesterol, high-sensitivity protein C reactive and ceruloplasmin were determined. RESULTS: in postmenopausal women the percentage of total fat was significantly (p< 0. 05), and independently of age, correlated with Hy (r= 0, 317) and TRI (r= 0. 357), percentage of fat in abdomen with TRI (r= 0. 476) while percentage of fat in legs was positively and negatively correlated with Hy (r= 0, 327) and TRI (r=- 0, 320). No significant associations were found among the considered variables in perimenopausal women. CONCLUSION: fat distribution fairly influences the level of different CVD risk factors in climacteric women...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the influence of}} correction for within-person variability (WPV) on the prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension.

Correction factors were calculated from an internal reproducibility study among 924 subjects who were examined in 1989 and 1990. The prevalence of hypertension without a correction of blood pressure values for WPV was substantially overestimated (38 %), whereas the prevalence of awareness and treatment of hypertension were substantially underestimated (- 13 % and - 28 %). The prevalence of control of hypertension did not change much after this correction.

Data were collected from two <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>population-based</b> <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> cardiovascular disease risk factors conducted from 1987 to 1995 among 55, 026 subjects aged 20 - 59 years. Correction factors were calculated from a reproducibility study among 924 subjects who were examined in 1989 and 1990. All other studies with repeated measurements of blood pressure were searched in MEDLINE from 1966 onward. Six studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of hypertension, uncorrected and corrected with factors from other studies, were compared with the prevalence of hypertension corrected with the factor from our study. The uncorrected prevalence of hypertension was 17. 3 % [95 %CI: 17. 0 - 17. 7]. The prevalence of hypertension after correction for WPV with the factor from our study was 13. 5 % [95 %CI: 13. 2 - 13. 8]. Correction for WPV with factors from the appropriate <b>studies</b> (depending <b>on</b> factors such as number of measurements taken per visit, and time interval between visits) resulted in prevalences ranging from 13. 9 % to 14. 7 %. The bias that occurs when no correction for WPV is performed is much larger (29 % overestimation) than the bias that occurs when correction factors are derived from other studies (3. 1 - 8. 4 % overestimation).

40|$|BACKGROUND: According to {{a number}} of reports, {{oxidative}} stress (OS) might be involved in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PO), {{one of the most critical}} disorders for elderly women 1. In particular, evidences suggest that oxygen reactive species (ROS) are able to influence bone metabolism, inducing the imbalance between bone resorption and formation, responsible for PO onset 2. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to investigate whether OS is involved in bone metabolism and PO development. METHODS: We carried out a <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>population-based</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> 103 climacteric women including 31 in peri- and 72 in post-menopause. Bone mineral density (BMD) of femur and spine was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The bone health status was also evaluated by assessing serum levels of bone alkaline phophatase (BAP) and collagen type 1 cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX- 1), markers of bone formation and resorption, respectively. Serum levels of hydroperoxides (Hy), total antioxidants, uric acid (UA), thiols and bone markers were also determined. RESULTS: DXA analysis revealed 25 healthy, 47 osteopenic and 31 osteoporotic subjects. Total antioxidants mean values were significantly (p< 0. 05) lower in both osteopenic and osteoporotic with respect to healthy women. Thiols and UA also showed a similar trend, but the differences between groups were not significant. Antioxidants and UA were also significantly correlated with BMD of femur (r= 0. 373 and 0. 390, respectively). Moreover, CTX- 1 was associated with Hy (r= 0. 328, p< 0. 05), but only in postmenopausal group. CONCLUSION: OS could play an important role in PO development by increasing the rate of bone resorption. Our findings are also suggestive of a potential use of antioxidants supplementation in PO treatment...|$|E

We aimed to assess the relationships between birth weight and markers of glucose homeostasis or obesity in adults. <b>Cross-sectional</b> <b>population-based</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> 1458 women and 1088 men aged 35 - 75 years living in Lausanne, Switzerland. Birth weight was self-reported and categorized into ≤ 2. 5, 2. 6 - 3. 5, 3. 6 - 4. 0 and > 4. 0 kg. Body composition was assessed by bioimpedance. Leptin and adiponectin levels were measured by ELISA. Women with low birth weight (≤ 2. 5 kg) had higher levels of fasting plasma glucose, insulin, HOMA, diabetes and metabolic syndrome; a non significant similar trend was seen in men. In both genders, height increased with birth weight, whereas a U-shaped association was found between birth weight and body mass index, waist circumference and body fat percentage. After adjusting for age, smoking status, physical activity and fat mass, an inverse association was found between leptin and birth weight categories: adjusted mean ± standard error 17. 3 ± 0. 7, 16. 2 ± 0. 3, 15. 6 ± 0. 5 and 14. 0 ± 0. 8 ng/dL for birth weight categories ≤ 2. 5, 2. 6 - 3. 5, 3. 6 - 4. 0 and > 4. 0 kg, respectively, in women (p < 0. 05) and 9. 8 ± 0. 8, 9. 1 ± 03, 7. 8 ± 0. 4 and 7. 7 ± 0. 5 ng/dL in men (p < 0. 05). An inverse association was also found between reported birth weight and leptin to fat mass ratio: mean ± standard error 0. 77 ± 0. 04, 0. 73 ± 0. 02, 0. 69 ± 0. 03 and 0. 62 ± 0. 04 in women (p < 0. 05); 0. 46 ± 0. 05, 0. 45 ± 0. 02, 0. 39 ± 0. 02 and 0. 38 ± 0. 03 in men (p < 0. 05). No differences in adiponectin levels were found between birth weight groups. Middle-aged adults born with a low weight present a higher prevalence of diabetes and obesity and also higher leptin levels and leptin to fat mass ratio than adults born with a normal weight. The higher leptin levels and leptin to fat mass ratio among adults born with a low weight {{might be related to}} nutritional factors during childhood or to the development of leptin resistance and/or higher leptin production by body fat unit.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis investigates {{the effect of}} somatic disorders on dementia, Alzheimer s disease (AD) and brain aging in late-life. The data for the studies are provided by the Kungsholmen Project (Studies I and II) and the Faenza Project (Studies III and IV). The Kungsholmen Project is a population-based longitudinal study on aging and dementia carried out on 75 + years old people, living in Stockholm, Sweden. The Faenza Project is a <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>population-based</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> dementia and cognitive impairment involving persons over 60 years, living in a wealthy area in Northern Italy. The major findings are summarized below. Study I. The hypothesis that anemia may {{increase the risk of}} dementia and AD was investigated using three-year follow-up data. Subjects who fulfilled WHO criteria for anemia (hemoglobin = 26, n= 1, 139) the association was stronger, and still significant after adjustment for conditions potentially related to anemia and dementia such as chronic diseases, inflammatory markers, and indicators of nutritional status. Using different definitions for anemia, a dose-response relationship between low hemoglobin concentration and incident dementia was observed: the lower the cut-off, the higher the probability of dementia. Study II. The relationship between body weight and dementia (or AD) was investigated using three-, six-, nine-year follow-up data. No association was detected between being underweight and dementia. Even after extensive adjustment, subjects with Body Mass Index (BMI) >= 25 had a lower risk of developing dementia than normal-weight subjects over nine years (HR: 0. 8, 95 % CI: 0. 6 0. 96). These results were confirmed also when the analysis was restricted to the cases occurring between three and nine, or between six and nine years of follow-up. Severe changes in BMI between baseline and three years of follow-up were associated with incident dementia in the following three years. Study III. The independent and combined effect of medical and social factors on cognitive status was investigated in the Faenza Project. A person was diagnosed with Cognitive Impairment No Dementia (CIND) if he/she scored two or more standard deviations lower than non-demented subjects on the adjusted MMSE. The diagnostic procedure identified 402 CIND cases (5. 4 %). Diabetes (OR: 1. 6, 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 2. 2), stroke (OR: 1. 9, 95 % CI: 1. 4 - 2. 6), and depressive symptoms (OR: 1. 9, 95 % CI: 1. 4 - 2. 7) were the most relevant associated medical comorbidities. The strength of the association increased when these conditions occurred in combination. Low education (OR: 1. 8, 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 2. 9), low socioeconomic status (OR: 1. 5, 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 2. 1), and unmarried status (OR: 1. 7, 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 2. 5) were also independently associated with CIND. Medical and social factors had a strong synergistic effect. Persons with at least one medical and one social factor were six {{times more likely to be}} diagnosed as CIND. Study IV. To investigate the relation between perceived cognitive decline and mental and somatic comorbidity we considered the non-demented, cognitively unimpaired cohort of the Faenza Project (n= 6, 825). According to the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), 20. 1 % and 8. 3 % of participants reported very mild or mild cognitive decline, respectively. Diseases significantly associated with perceived cognitive decline were stroke (OR: 1. 8; 95 % CI: 1. 3 - 2. 3), malignancy (OR: 2. 7, 95 % CI: 1. 3 - 5. 7), cardiovascular disorders (OR: 1. 7, 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 2. 3), diabetes (OR: 1. 6; 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 2. 2), and depressive and anxiety symptoms (OR: 3. 7, 95 % CI: 2. 4 - 4. 2; OR: 1. 6, 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 2. 1). Mental, cardiovascular, and respiratory diseases accounted for the discrepancy between perceived cognitive decline and cognitive performance. Conclusions. The findings support the hypothesis that several somatic disorders might affect brain aging and dementia. This thesis suggests that late-life anemia is a risk factor for dementia, that diabetes, stroke, and depressive symptoms are clinical correlates of CIND, and that mental and somatic morbidity accounts for the discrepancy between perceived cognitive decline and cognitive performance. Finally, we do not confirm being overweight in late-life as a risk factor for dementia, but we suggest that weight loss is a good predictor of incipient dementia...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine whether low levels of oestradiol and testosterone are associated with impaired mobility, low muscle strength and the incidence of falls in a population-based sample of older men and women. Design: <b>Cross-sectional</b> <b>population-based</b> <b>study,</b> based <b>on</b> data of the Longitudinal Ageing Study Amsterdam (LASA), including 623 men and 663 women, aged 65 - 88 years. Measurements: Serum levels of oestradiol, testosterone, albumin and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured. Physical performance, functional limitations and muscle strength were assessed, and a follow-up on falls was performed prospectively within 3 years. Results: After adjustment for age, level of education, alcohol use, physical activity, chronic disease and body mass index (BMI), men in the highest quartile of the oestradiol/SHBG ratio had significantly higher physical performance scores than men in the lowest quartile (β = 0. 103). Serum levels of total testosterone were positively associated with muscle strength (β = 0. 085). Calculated bioavailable testosterone levels were positively associated with physical performance and muscle strength (β = 0. 128 and 0. 109 respectively). No associations of oestradiol levels with mobility were seen in women. Levels of oestradiol and testosterone were not associated with falls.

The total sample size of the study at the urban and rural research sites (244 municipalities) was 23. 694 elderly Colombians representative of the total population. The study had three components: (1) a questionnaire covering active aging determinants including anthropometry, blood pressure measurement, physical function, and biochemical and hematological measures; (2) a subsample survey among family caregivers; (3) a qualitative study with gender and cultural perspectives of quality of life to understand different dimensions of people meanings. Conclusions. The SABE Colombia is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary study of the elderly with respect to active aging determinants. The results of this study are intended to inform public policies aimed at tackling health inequalities for the aging society in Colombia...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the oral health status of older adults living in northeastern Germany. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Representative samples of adults aged 60 years or older were examined as part of Study of the Health in Pomerania, a <b>cross-sectional,</b> <b>population-based</b> <b>study.</b> Data <b>on</b> 1446 subjects aged 60 - 79 years were evaluated for coronal caries using the decayed/missing/filled teeth (DMFT) index, root caries using the root caries index (RCI), calculus, plaque, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment loss. RESULTS: The prevalence of edentulousness varied from 16 % in the 60 - 65 -year-old group to 30 % in the 75 - 79 -year-old group, whereas the median number of remaining natural teeth per subject varied from 14 in the youngest age group (60 - 65 years) to one in the oldest (75 - 79 years). Among subjects aged 60 - 69 years, a quarter (26 %) of the teeth examined had coronal restoration against 17 % in the oldest age group (70 - 79 years). Coronal caries was found in 2 % of the teeth in both age groups. Among teeth with gingival recession, 6 % had fillings on root surfaces and 2 % had root caries, irrespective of age. In all, 11 % of the subjects had at least one untreated coronal lesion and 27 % had at least one untreated root caries lesion. Plaque score, calculus score and bleeding on probing were higher in the oldest age group (70 - 79 years). The prevalence of periodontal disease expressed as the presence of at least one periodontal pocket of 4 mm and more, was higher in men and among the younger subjects (men aged 60 - 69 years: 85 % vs. 71 % in 70 - 79 -year-old men; women aged 60 - 69 years: 71 % vs. 62 % in 70 - 79 -year-olds). The prevalence of attachment loss of 3 mm or more followed a similar pattern. CONCLUSIONS: It seems therefore that in this population, the major oral health concern is related to caries and the small number of teeth retained among the dentate subjects. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the timing of}} contraceptive use and estimate the discontinuation rates of temporary methods among women after abortion, or a live birth or stillbirth. Methods: A sample of married women with detailed pregnancy and contraceptive histories was analyzed in a <b>population-based</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>study</b> based <b>on</b> calendar data extracted from the 2011 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey. Kaplan–Meier cumulative and discrete-time hazard models were used to estimate the timing of contraceptive use and discontinuation rates among users of temporary methods. Results: The final analysis sample included 3190 women. Of 684 women who had had an abortion, 298 (43. 6 %) had not initiated any contraceptive use in the 12 months afterwards. Women initiated contraceptive use significantly earlier after abortion (hazard ratio [HR] 2. 25; 95 % CI, 1. 96 – 2. 59; P < 0. 001). The rate of discontinuation among contraceptive users was significantly higher in the postabortion group (HR 1. 32; 95 % CI, 1. 05 – 1. 65; P < 0. 05). Women who had used contraceptives before the index pregnancy, had two sons, were wealthier, were educated, and had autonomy initiated contraceptive use more rapidly. Conclusion: Postabortion contraceptive use is low in Nepal. Postabortion family-planning counseling and related services should be strengthened with systematic monitoring and follow-up interventions...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the {{proportion}} of breastfed infants and correlate it with sociodemographic data in Campinas (SP), Brazil. Methods: Between 2004 and 2005, interviewers visited 2, 857 homes of children under two years of age and interviewed their mothers with a structured questionnaire containing questions regarding their socioeconomic level, breastfeeding practices and complementary foods. This randomized, <b>cross-sectional,</b> <b>population-based</b> <b>study</b> was based <b>on</b> data of "Children Born Alive" and on the prevalence of breastfeeding. The median breastfeeding duration was determined by Kaplan Meier's survival analysis and the time was adjusted by Cox's multivariate analysis. The significance level was set at 5 %. Results: Median exclusive breastfeeding was 90 days (CI 95 %: 87. 6 - 92. 4); and median general breastfeeding was 120 days (CI 95 %: 117. 7 - 122. 3). At 1 month of age, 66. 2 % of the children were exclusively breastfed; this percentage decreased to 2. 3 % at 6 months of age. Tea and powdered milk were introduced at a median age of 120 days (CI 95 %: 113. 2 - 126. 8 and CI 95 %: 112. 7 - 127. 3 respectively) [...] The child's skin color and the mother's education level, profession and marital status were associated with breastfeeding duration and practices. Conclusion: Sociodemographic factors can interfere in median breastfeeding duration.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{factors associated}} with subsyndromal depression (SSD) in very old persons, {{and to develop a}} model for prediction of SSD among very old persons. METHODS: A <b>cross-sectional,</b> <b>population-based</b> <b>study</b> was undertaken <b>on</b> 85 -year-old persons in Sweden. Data were collected from a postal questionnaire, assessments in the participants' homes and at reception visits. Depressiveness was screened with GDS- 15 (Geriatric Depression Scale), and the results were classified into three outcome categories: non-depression (ND), SSD and syndromal depression. Data were analysed with binary logistic, ordinal logistic and linear regression. RESULTS: With univariate logistic regression 20 {{factors associated with}} SSD were identified in very old persons, and the four hypothesized domains-sociodemographic factors, declining physical functioning, neuropsychiatric factors and existential factors-significantly related to SSD. The multivariate logistic model included seven independent factors that increase the likelihood of SSD instead of ND (lower self-perceived health, life not meaningful, problems with self-care, use of tranquilizing medication, no contact with neighbours, history of affective disorder and history of stroke). The ordinal logistic and the linear regression models resulted in seven partly different factors for predicting SSD and depressiveness, in the very old. CONCLUSIONS: The identified markers may help clinicians with the detection, prevention and treatment of SSD in very old persons. The findings indicate the importance of a comprehensive functional approach to diagnosing and treating depressiveness in this population, and the findings might be interpreted as offering support for the coexistence of a dimensional and a categorical view on depressive disorders.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{describe}} {{the lack of}} access and continuity {{of health care in}} adults. METHODS A <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>population-based</b> <b>study</b> was performed <b>on</b> a sample of 12, 402 adults aged 20 to 59 years in urban areas of 100 municipalities of 23 states in the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. Barriers to the access and continuity of health care and were investigated based on receiving, needing and seeking health care (hospitalization and accident/emergency care in the last 12 months; care provided by a doctor, by other health professional or home care in the last three months). Based on the results obtained by the description of the sample, a projection is provided for adults living in Brazilian urban areas. RESULTS The highest prevalence of lack of access to health services and to provision of care by health professionals was for hospitalization (3. 0 %), whilst the lowest prevalence was for care provided by a doctor (1. 1 %). The lack of access to care provided by other health professionals was 2. 0 %; to accident and emergency services, 2. 1 %; and to home care, 2. 9 %. As for prevalences, the greatest absolute lack of access occurred in emergency care (more than 360, 000 adults). The main reasons were structural and organizational problems, such as unavailability of hospital beds, of health professionals, of appointments for the type of care needed and charges made for care. CONCLUSIONS The universal right to health care in Brazil has not yet been achieved. These projections can help health care management in scaling the efforts needed to overcome this problem, such as expanding the infrastructure of health services and the workforce...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} {{of the use of}} medicines and other products for therapeutic purposes in the Brazilian pediatric population and test whether demographic, socioeconomic and health factors are associated with use. METHODS A <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>population-based</b> <b>study</b> (National Survey <b>on</b> Access, Use and Promotion of Rational Use of Medicines – PNAUM), including 7, 528 children aged 12 or younger, living in urban areas in Brazil. Medicine use to treat chronic or acute diseases was reported by the primary caregiver present at the household interview. Associations between independent variables and medicine use were investigated by Poisson regression. RESULTS The overall prevalence of medicine use was 30. 7 % (95 %CI 28. 3 – 33. 1). The prevalence of medicine use for chronic diseases was 5. 6 % (95 %CI 4. 7 – 6. 7) and for acute conditions, 27. 1 % (95 %CI 24. 8 – 29. 4). The factors significantly associated with overall use were five years old or under, living in the Northeast region, having health insurance and using health services in the last 12 months (emergency visits and hospitalizations). The following were associated with drug use for chronic diseases: age ≥ 2 years, Southeast and South regions, and use of health services. For drug use in treating acute conditions, the following associated factors were identified: ≤ 5 years, North, Northeast or Midwest regions, health insurance, and one or more emergency visits. The most commonly used drugs among children under two years of age were paracetamol, ascorbic acid, and dipyrone; for children aged two years or over they were dipyrone, paracetamol, and amoxicillin. CONCLUSIONS The use of medicine by children is considerable, especially in treating acute medical conditions. Children using drugs for chronic diseases have a different demographic profile from those using drugs for acute conditions in relation to gender, age, and geographic region...|$|R

BACKGROUND: Chronic pain interfering with activities of daily living is highly prevalent in the community. More than 600 million people worldwide are obese. The aim of this paper is to assess if such chronic pain is associated independently with obesity across the adult population, having controlled for other key factors. METHODS: The South Australian Health Omnibus is an annual, <b>population-based,</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>study.</b> Data <b>on</b> 2616 participants were analysed for episodes of daily pain for three of the preceding six months. Obesity was derived from self-reported height and weight. Multivariable logistic regression analysed the associations between chronic pain interfering with activities of daily living, body mass index (BMI) and key socio-demographic factors. RESULTS: Chronic pain interfering with activities of daily living peaks in people ≥ 75 years of age while obesity peaks in the 45 - 54 age group. Pain and obesity together peak in the 55 - 74 year age group. In the adjusted multinominal logistic regression model, compared to those with no pain, there was a strong association between obesity and pain that interfered moderately or extremely with day-to-day activities (OR 2. 25; 95...|$|R
40|$|Background: Diabetic {{retinopathy}} and its consequence, diabetic macular edema, {{are leading}} causes of vision loss in diabetics and can develop even {{in the first years}} after onset of diabetes. Being asymptomatic in primary phase and having compensatory effect of bilateral vision delay the necessity of eye care utilization. We conducted this study to determine diabetic individuals' level of awareness about the importance of regular eye examinations. Methods: As part of the <b>cross-sectional,</b> <b>population-based,</b> Yazd Eye <b>Study</b> <b>on</b> people aged 40 – 80 years, diabetic participants were identified for enrollment in this research. Participants underwent thorough ophthalmic examinations as well as detailed interview. Well-trained interviewers asked participants about their awareness of screening eye examinations and their necessity. Fasting blood sugar, glycated hemoglobin, and complete lipid profile were assessed. All descriptive and analytic tests were done in survey mode. Logistic regression was applied to assess related risk factors. Results: Among 497 diabetic persons out of 2098 participants, 364 respondents (73. 4 %; 95 % confidence interval: 68. 6 - 78. 2) were not aware of the necessity of regular eye examinations. Among 133 aware respondents, 21 (16 %) respondents had no eye examination over the past year. Educational level significantly correlated with awareness (P = 0. 004), and physicians were the most frequent source of awareness (79. 7 %). Conclusions: This study showed that a significant proportion of Yazd diabetic population (about 73 %) needs to be informed about the necessity of regular eye examinations. The remaining respondents, who had this information, mainly had undergone regular ophthalmologist visits, which imply that educational interventions could improve the situation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Diabetes is a {{risk factor}} for {{cardiovascular}} diseases (CVDs) and there are reports of increasing prevalence of prediabetes in Nigeria. This study therefore characterised CVDs risk factors in subjects with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and diabetes. Methods Data from 4 <b>population-based</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> 2447 apparently healthy individuals from 18 - 89  years were analysed. Anthropometric, blood pressure and biochemical parameters were collected and classified. Individuals with IFG (prediabetes) and diabetes were merged each for positive cases of dyslipidaemia, high blood pressure (HBP) or obesity. Optimal Discriminant and Hierarchical Optimal Classification Tree Analysis (HO-CTA) were employed. Results Overall prevalence of IFG and diabetes were 5. 8 % (CI: 4. 9 – 6. 7 %) and 3. 1 % (CI: 2. 4 – 3. 8 %), respectively. IFG co-morbidity with dyslipidaemia (5. 0 %; CI: 4. 1 – 5. 8 %) was the highest followed by overweight/obese (3. 1 %; CI: 2. 5 – 3. 8 %) and HBP (1. 8 %; CI: 1. 3 – 2. 4 %). The predicted age of IFG or diabetes and their co-morbidity with other CVD risk factors were between 40 – 45  years. Elevated blood level of total cholesterol was the most predictive co-morbid risk factor among IFG and diabetes subjects. Hypertriglyceridaemia was an important risk factor among IFG-normocholesterolaemic-overweight/obese individuals. Conclusion The higher prevalence of co-morbidity of CVD risk factors with IFG than in diabetes plus the similar age of co-morbidity between IFG and diabetes highlights the need for risk assessment models for prediabetes and education of individuals at risk about factors that mitigate development of diabetes and CVDs...|$|R

40|$|We {{performed}} {{a study to}} estimate the prevalence of and factors associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody-testing behaviour among youth in Hong Kong. It was a <b>population-based</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>study.</b> Questions <b>on</b> HIV testing were asked {{as part of a}} youth sexuality study conducted in July to December 1996 among young adults in Hong Kong. A total of 517 (53. 6 %) males and 447 (46. 4 %) females aged 17 to 28 years completed an anonymous structured self-administered questionnaire. Respondents had good knowledge about correct modes of HIV transmission and prevention. 9. 4 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 7. 0, 12. 3) of males and 6. 4 % (95 % CI: 4. 3, 9. 1) of females had been tested for HIV through blood donation. Excluding blood donation, 3. 7 % (95 % CI: 2. 2, 5. 7) of males and 3. 6 % (95 % CI: 2. 1, 5. 9) of females had been tested (voluntary testing). 47. 5 % (95 % CI: 44. 4, 50. 7) of subjects reported at least one major risk factor for HIV infection. In multivariate analyses, factors independently associated with both voluntary HIV testing and HIV testing by blood donation were age and having had sex with multiple partners. A higher educational level was a predictor of HIV testing by blood donation. Self-assessment of having sufficient sex education was also significantly associated with voluntary HIV testing. HIV testing is not widespread in Hong Kong and those at risk {{are more likely to have}} been tested. It is of concern, however, that many of those reporting risk factors have not been tested. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Hearing {{difficulties}} {{constitute the}} most common cause of disability globally. Yet, <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> people with hearing difficulties regarding socio-economic status (SES), work, long-term unemployment, sickness absence, and disability pension are scarce. The aim of the present study was to investigate the main income sources of men and women of working ages with and without self-reported hearing difficulties and associations with gender, age, SES, type of living area, and country of birth. Methods A <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>population-based</b> <b>study,</b> using information <b>on</b> self-reported hearing difficulties and SES of 19 045 subjects aged 20 – 64 years participating in Statistics Sweden’s annual Living Conditions Surveys in any of the years 2004 through 2008. The information was linked to a nationwide database containing data on demographics and income sources. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, using binary logistic regression analysis. Results Hearing difficulties increased with age and were more common in men (age-adjusted OR: 1. 42 (95 % CI: 1. 30 - 1. 56)) with an overall prevalence of 13. 1 % in men and 9. 8 % in women. Using working men as reference, the OR of having hearing difficulties was 1. 23 (0. 94 - 1. 60) in men with unemployment benefits and 1. 36 (1. 13 - 1. 65) in men with sickness benefits or disability pension, when adjusting for age and SES. The corresponding figures in women were 1. 59 (1. 17 - 2. 16) and 1. 73 (1. 46 - 2. 06). The OR of having sickness benefits or disability pension in subjects with hearing difficulties was 1. 36 (1. 12 - 1. 64) in men and 1. 70 (1. 43 - 2. 01) in women, when adjusting for age and SES and using men and women with no hearing difficulties as reference. Conclusions Hearing difficulties were more prevalent in men. After adjustment with age and SES as well as with type of living area and country of birth, a significant association with unemployment benefits was found only in women, and the associations with long-term sickness absence and disability pension tended to be stronger in women. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: First, to {{estimate}} the rate and characteristic of low back pain (LBP) among Hong Kong middle-aged women. Second, to explore the relationship between being overweight, having tall stature and LBP prevalence. DESIGN: A case-control study of Hong Kong community-based middle-aged women was conducted. SUBJECTS: The study subjects were either from the University Family Medicine Clinic or from a <b>population-based</b> <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> health in middle-aged women conducted by the Department of Community and Family Medicine (based on a randomized sample of telephone numbers from the Hong Kong residential telephone directory in 1991). Among the 928 potential eligible subjects from both sources, a total of 182 cases and 235 controls participated in this study. MEASUREMENTS: Data were collected from personal interviews and anthropometric measurements. Participants were asked about exclusion criteria, the occurrence of LBP and demographics factors. The anthropometric measurements included measures of body height, body weight, waist and hip circumferences. RESULTS: Among the 182 cases who entered this study, 83 women (45. 6 %) had 1 -< 14 days of LBP, and 99 women (54. 4 %) had at least 14 days of LBP in the previous 12 months. Having tall stature and being overweight {{were found to have}} no association with LBP prevalence. Conversely, high waist-to-hip ratio (0. 8) was noted to be inversely associated with the risk of severe (at least 14 days) LBP (adjusted odds ratio= 0. 43, 95 % confidence interval 0. 26 - 0. 70) even when controlling for other risk factors together, but not for the overall (at least one day) LBP. CONCLUSION: This case-control study found no association between excessive weight, tall stature and an increased risk of LBP prevalence in Hong Kong Chinese middle-aged women. Conversely, the results indicate that a high waist to hip ratio was associated with a lower risk of severe LBP. Prospective studies are needed to further evaluate the association between underweight/obesity, bone mass density and LBP. School of Nursin...|$|R
