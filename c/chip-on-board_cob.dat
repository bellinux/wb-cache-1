40|$|There {{are many}} methods of {{detecting}} degradation in die-attach materials, e. g.

The method, we present in this work, is non-destructive and enables in-situ monitoring of degradation. Voids or cracks cause the change of thermal behaviour in electronic packages, therefore the thermal behaviour is due to alter over lifetime. Therefore parametric simulation models have been developed, which enable the prediction of influence of delamination areas on transient thermal properties for different die attach materials. The simulation on example <b>COB</b> (<b>chip-on-board)</b> packages show, that an increase of delamination area causes a significant increase of transient thermal resistance.

The entire transmitter is encapsulated in biocompatible silicone rubber. Power is supplied by on-board silver-oxide batteries.

According to the packaging roadmap, worldwide COB market trend would most likely expand to about 25 billion units per year by 2001 [1]. The popularity of COB is driven by its lower cost and its compatibility to the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) surface mounting process.

This paper investigated possible sources of voiding in the dispensed glob-top material used in COBs. Factors such as substrate temperature, substrate preheat time, dispensing parameters, globtop thawing condition as well as curing profile were examined. The detection and quantification of voids was performed by C-mode and Tomographic Acoustic Micro Imaging (TAMI (TM)) mode scanning acoustic microscopy.

40|$|WITTEX, {{named in}} honor of E. Witte, who in 1878 first {{discovered}} the geostrophic current equation, is an acronym for Water Inclination Topography and Technology Experiment. WITTEX consists of three co-planar small satellite radar altimeters launched on the same vehicle into a GEOSAT -class orbit. The proposed satellite constellation would support measurement for the first time of both orthogonal components of the ocean 2 ̆ 7 s surface slope, rather than the single component seen by conventional instruments. The satellites are spaced by several kilometers along their orbit; Earth rotation causes their sub-satellite tracks to be laterally separated. Track separation can be readily adjusted by selection and autonomous control of inter-satellite spacing. If the satellite spacing were about 900 km, then the sub-satellite orbit tracks would fall approximately uniformly 53 km apart at the equator. This spacing is nearly optimal for observing oceanic eddy fields and surface energy transport. The enabling conceptual innovation is the delay-Doppler radar altimeter (DDA). Studies have shown that this technique yields more precise measurements than a conventional radar altimeter, yet it requires much less transmitted power. The notional instrument has two frequencies and an onboard water vapor radiometer, similar to TOPEX. The DDA approach, combined with recent advances in spacecraft technology, leads to substantial miniaturization; the goal is to use Pegasus as the launch vehicle.

40|$|Asian {{industry}} and development is currently {{very focused on}} replacing extremely expensive Au wire with Cu or Pd-plated Cu in IC (mass production) packaging technologies (ball/wedge bonding). In contrast, Europe traditionally is researching and developing {{in the field of}} wedge/wedge bonding using heavy wire (> 100 m) for power electronic modules or standard (thin) wire (< 100 m, mostly 25 - 50 m) for <b>chip-on-board</b> (<b>COB)</b> applications. One primary failure mechanism limiting the lifetime of power modules is Al wedge lift-off due to the different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of the Al wedge and the chip (Si). This classical type of fatigue cracking can be reduced by using materials of higher strength and/or lower CTE. Key strategies include doping or alloying elements and/or optimizing bonding conditions to improve the microstructure. Cu-based wire or Cu-Al bimetal ribbons are another option, although these include changes to the chip structure and metallization. Al Si 1 has been the industry standard bonding material in wedge/wedge thin wire bonding for many years. Its thermal stability is limited at temperature above 100 °C due to recrystallization, grain growth and Si coagulation. For example, glob top material curing processes used in chip on board (COB) applications (e. g. several hours at 160 °C) can decrease the strength of standard AlSi 1 wire to less than 60 % of its original value. Research and development is currently attempting to improve this situation by alloying and doping Al base material to increase high-temperature behavior or by using Al-coated Au or Cu wires.

40|$|Wire bonding is {{a widely}} used {{interconnection}} technology in electronic packaging. Due to the advantages of fast bonding process, high productivity, good electrical and thermal performance, Au wire bonding has been widely applied to various electronic packaging applications, such as Multi chip module (MCM), B all grid array (BGA) and <b>Chip-on-board</b> (<b>COB).</b> The organic substrates for Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) have a low glass transitional temperature, Tg, typically 130 °C. This imposes limitations on the wire bonding process because wire bonding must be performed at temperatures far below the Tgof the substrate to avoid softening of the materials. Meanwhile, a substrate with a high Tg incurs additional cost arising from material and fabrication processes. The objective of this thesis is to optimize metallization and process variables to enhance wire bondability and product yields of low temperature Au wedge thermosonic bonding. The wire bond strength with various metallization characteristics were correlated to establish the process window for successful low temperature wire bonding. The technological understanding acquired in this thesis {{can be used as}} a practical guideline for PCB metallization plating and processing conditions. The research was carried out in four stages. The first stage examined the surface characteristics of various metallization schemes on conventional FR- 4 PCBs. The second stage investigated the interrelation between the metallization characteristics and the wire bonding process variables. The third stage studied the improvement in wire bonding by plasma cleaning. The last stage was a study of high temperature wire bonding on Bismaleimide triazine (BT) substrate. Based on the bond tests and process windows established, optimizing bonding parameters for acceptable wire bond strengths at low temperatures were identified.

40|$|Moisture induced {{plastic package}} defects {{have long been}} primary {{concerns}} for design and reliability engineers. It is estimated that over 40 % devices' failures, such as delamination, corrosion and popcorning, are induced by moisture. Weight gain method {{which is the most}} commonly used to investigate moisture uptake and diffusivity in bulk, is convenient, but, not specific. Therefore, the need to observe the moisture content as a function of time at that interface for package reliability study drives the motivation of the development of the moisture sensing chip (MoistChip). Most popular humidity sensors are polymeric; however, they normally could not withstand prolonged hot wet environment (> 60 ℃ / 60 %RH). Existing high performance ceramic humidity sensors such as porous silicon, sol-gel and powder sintering either require complex and sophisticated process control, or heat treatment at around 1000 ℃, so they are all not compatible to IC fabrication process. Process design of MoistChips makes use of additional negative DC bias at the substrate during sputtering and annealing time, such that the sensing film could be fabricated at below 500 ℃. with optimized conditions, MoistChips could have 4 order of magnitude change in current sensitivity and improved hysteresis. Modified electrode pattern design helps to bring signal magnification to a milli-ampere level and linearization with curve fitting coefficient, R 2, to greater than 0. 98. MoistChip-packaging encapsulates the bond-wires, but not the sensing element. Small drift in signal response shows good performance after encapsulation at high temperature, about 200 ℃, and minimal poisoning by the out-gassing of the encapsulant curing process. MoistChips packaged inside <b>Chip-On-Board</b> (<b>COB)</b> package provided a real-time and in-situ moisture diffusion measurement under JEDEC Level 1 condition.

However, in low-cost and high volume short-haul applications at data rates of around 10 Gbps (such as LAN, MAN, and board-to-board interconnection), {{there has been an}} increasing interest in commercial CMOS technology for implementing the laser driver. This is because CMOS technology has unique advantages such as low power and low cost of fabrication that are the result of high yield and a high degree of integration. Therefore, the objective of this research in this dissertation is to investigate the possibility of implementing a high-speed CMOS laser driver for these cost sensitive applications. The high-speed CMOS laser drivers designed in this research are of two types. The first type is a low power laser driver for driving a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). The other driver type is a high current laser driver for driving edge-emitting lasers such as double-heterojunction (DH), multiquantum well (MQW), or Febry-Perrot (FP) lasers. The parasitic effects of the layout geometry are crucial {{in the design of the}} high-speed laser drivers. Thus, in this research, all simulations contain a complete set of parasitic elements extracted from the layout of the laser driver. To test laser drivers, <b>chip-on-board</b> (<b>COB)</b> technology is employed, and printed circuit boards (PCBs) to test the laser drivers are designed at the same time as the laser drivers themselves and manufactured specifically for these tests. This research makes two significant new contributions to the technology that are reported and described here. One is the first 10 Gbps performance of a differential CMOS laser driver with better than 10 - 14 bit-error-rate (BER). The second is the first demonstration of a heterogeneous integration method to integrate independently grown and customized thin film lasers onto CMOS laser driver circuits to form an optical transmitter.

40|$|The major {{impetus for}} flight {{qualifying}} <b>Chip-On-Board</b> (<b>COB)</b> packaging {{technology is the}} shift in emphasis for space missions to smaller, better, and cheaper spacecraft and satellites resulting from the NASA New Millenium initiative and similar requirements in DoD-sponsored programs. The most important benefit that can potentially be derived from miniaturizing spacecraft and satellites is the significant cost saving realizable if a smaller launch vehicle may be employed. Besides the program cost saving, {{there are several other}} advantages to building COB-based space hardware. First, once a well-controlled process is established, COB can be low cost compared to standard Multi-Chip Module (MCM) technology. This cost competitiveness is regarded {{as a result of the}} generally greater availability and lower cost of Known Good Die (KGD). Coupled with the elimination of the first level of packaging (chip package), compact, high-density circuit boards can be realized with Printed Wiring Boards (PWB) that can now be made with ever-decreasing feature size in line width and via hole. Since the COB packaging technique in this study is based mainly on populating bare dice on a suitable multi-layer laminate substrate which is not hermetically sealed, die coating for protection from the environment is required. In recent years, significant improvements have been made in die coating materials which further enhance the appeal of COB. Hysol epoxies, silicone, parylene and silicon nitride are desirable because of their compatible Thermal Coefficient of Expansion (TCE) and good moisture resistant capability. These die coating materials have all been used in the space and other industries with varying degrees of success. COB technology, specifically siliconnitride coated hardware, has been flown by Lockheed on the Polar satellite. In addition, DARPA has invested a substantial amount of resources on MCM and COB-related activities recently. With COB on the verge of becoming a dominant player in DoD programs, DARPA is increasing its support of the availability of KGDs which will help decrease their cost. Aside from the various major developments and trends in the space and defense industries that are favorable to the acceptance and widespread use of'COB packaging technology, implementing COB can be appealing in other aspects. Since the interconnection interface is usually the weak link in a system, the overall circuit or system reliability may actually be improved because of the elimination of a level of interconnect/packaging at the chip. With COB, mixing packaging technologies is possible. Because some devices are only available in commercial plastic packages, populating a multi-layer laminate substrate with both bare dice and plastic-package parts is inevitable. Another attractive feature of COB is that re-workability is possible if die coating is applied only on the die top. This method allows local replacement of individual dice that were found to be defective instead of replacing an entire board. In terms of thermal management, unpackaged devices offer a shorter thermal resistance path than their packaged counterparts thereby improving thermal sinking and heat removal from the parts...|$|E
