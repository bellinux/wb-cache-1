25|$|In 1979, {{the initial}} Dye-3 deep bedrock {{drilling}} was started using a 22.2cm diameter CRREL thermal (US) <b>coring</b> drill {{to produce an}} 18cm diameter access hole, which was cased, {{to a depth of}} 77 m.

25|$|In August 2002 a {{detailed}} and comprehensive geophysical {{survey of the}} motte and bailey was carried out and an application was made to English Heritage to carry out small-scale excavations of the site.

25|$|For an {{intermediate}} drilling c. 390 m, the drill was installed 25 m {{below the surface}} {{at the bottom of}} the Dye 3 radar station. Some 740 seasonal δ18 cycles were counted, indicating that the core reached back to 1231 AD. Evident in this <b>coring</b> was that as melt water seeps through the porous snow, it refreezes somewhere in the cold firn and disturbs the layer sequence.|$|E

25|$|Due to an {{increasing}} scientific demand, in 1999 the French Ministry of Research reduced the ship {{time devoted to}} logistical operations to 120 days per year and allowed the IPEV to conduct research world-wide for the remaining 245 days a year. Therefore, the ship is no longer confined to the Indian Ocean and conducts research in all oceans. This has allowed {{for the development of}} integrated, multidisciplinary programs, for instance, spending several months in 1999 <b>coring</b> for paleo-climatic purposes in the North Atlantic.|$|E
25|$|Certainly, {{the central}} Arctic Ocean was {{ice-free}} before, during, {{and after the}} PETM. This can be ascertained from the composition of sediment cores recovered during the Arctic <b>Coring</b> Expedition (ACEX) at 87°N on Lomonosov Ridge. Moreover, temperatures increased during the PETM, {{as indicated by the}} brief presence of subtropical dinoflagellates, and a marked increase in TEX86. The latter record is intriguing, though, because it suggests a 6°C (11°F) rise from ~ before the PETM to ~ during the PETM. Assuming the TEX86 record reflects summer temperatures, it still implies much warmer temperatures on the North Pole compared to the present day, but no significant latitudinal amplification relative to surrounding time.|$|E
25|$|After {{working out}} various {{logistical}} and engineering {{problems related to}} the development of a more sophisticated drilling rig, drilling to bedrock at Dye 3 began in the summer of 1979 using a new Danish electro-mechanical ice drill yielding a 10.2cm diameter core. From July to August 1979 using ISTUK, 273 m of core was removed. At the end of the 1980 field season ISTUK had gnawed down to 901 m. In 1981 at a depth of 1785 m dust and conductivity measurements indicated the beginning of ice from the last glaciation. <b>Coring</b> continued and on August 10, 1981, bedrock was reached at a depth of 2038 m. The depth range for the Danish drill was 80–2038 m.|$|E

25|$|Piston {{samplers}}. These samplers are thin-walled metal tubes {{which contain}} a piston at the tip. The samplers are {{pushed into the}} bottom of a borehole, with the piston remaining at the surface of the soil while the tube slides past it. These samplers will return undisturbed samples in soft soils, but are difficult to advance in sands and stiff clays, and can be damaged (compromising the sample) if gravel is encountered. The , developed by D. A. Livingstone, is a commonly used piston sampler. A modification of the Livingstone corer with a serrated <b>coring</b> head allows it to be rotated to cut through subsurface vegetable matter such as small roots or buried twigs.|$|E
25|$|Sthalekar {{started the}} 2009–10 WNCL season slowly, going wicketless in two matches against Queensland.

She made 42 in the next match against Victoria, a five-wicket win, before taking 3/26 and making 27 in a 67-run defeat the next day. Sthalekar then peacked during the double-header against Western Australia. In the first match, she made 108 not out as New South Wales amassed 3/303 and took 1/11 as they {{completed}} a 127-run win. The next day, she took 4/14 from her ten overs, helping to dismiss Western Australia for 99 {{and set up a}} ten-wicket win. New South Wales won eight of their ten round-robin matches and proceeded to the final against Victoria, Sthalekar scored 49 as the defending champions made 9/206. She then bowled only three overs, taking 0/15 as her state completed another WNCL title with a 59-run win, bowling out the Victorians for 147.

500|$|The first {{systematic}} {{study of}} snow and firn layers was by Ernst Sorge, {{who was part of}} the Alfred Wegener Expedition to central Greenland in 1930–1931. [...] Sorge dug a 15m pit to examine the snow layers, and his results were later formalized into Sorge's Law of Densification by Henri Bader, who went on to do additional <b>coring</b> work in northwest Greenland in 1933. [...] In the early 1950s, a SIPRE expedition took pit samples over much of the Greenland ice sheet, obtaining early oxygen isotope ratio data. [...] Three other expeditions in the 1950s began ice <b>coring</b> work: a joint Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition (NBSAE), in Queen Maud Land in Antarctica; the Juneau Ice Field Research Project (JIRP), in Alaska; and Expéditions Polaires Françaises, in central Greenland. [...] Core quality was poor, but some scientific work was done on the retrieved ice.|$|E

40|$|Cost {{effective}} SOC test strongly {{hinges on}} parallel, independent test of SOC <b>cores,</b> {{which can only}} be ensured through proper <b>core</b> isola-tion techniques. While a <b>core</b> isolation mechanism can provide con-trollability and observability at the <b>core</b> I/O interface, its implemen-tation may have various implications on area, functional timing, test time and data volume, and at-speed coverage on the <b>core</b> interface. In this paper, we propose a non-intrusive <b>core</b> isolation technique that is based on the utilization of existing <b>core</b> registers for isolating the <b>core.</b> We provide a <b>core</b> register partitioning algorithm that is capa-ble of identifying the <b>core</b> interface registers, and of robustly isolating a <b>core,</b> resulting in a computationally efficient <b>core</b> isolation imple-mentation that is area and performance efficient at the same time. The proposed isolation technique also ensures minimal test time increase and no at-speed coverage loss on the <b>core</b> interface, offering an el-egant solution for soft <b>cores,</b> and thus enabling significant SOC test cost reductions. 1...|$|R

500|$|The drill removes {{an annulus}} of ice around the core {{but does not}} cut under it. A {{spring-loaded}} lever arm called a core dog can break off the core and hold it in place while it is brought to the surface. [...] The core is then extracted from the drill barrel, usually by laying it out flat so that the core can slide out onto a prepared surface. [...] The core must be cleaned of drilling fluid as it is slid out; for the WAIS Divide <b>coring</b> project, a vacuuming system {{was set up to}} facilitate this. [...] The surface that receives the core should be aligned as accurately as possible with the drill barrel to minimise mechanical stress on the core, which can easily break. [...] The ambient temperature is kept well below freezing to avoid thermal shock.|$|E
500|$|The {{logistics}} of any <b>coring</b> project are complex because the locations are usually difficult to reach, {{and may be}} at high altitude. [...] The largest projects require years of planning and years to execute, and are usually run as international consortiums. [...] The EastGRIP project, for example, which as of 2017 is drilling in eastern Greenland, {{is run by the}} Centre for Ice and Climate, in Denmark, and includes representatives from 12 countries on its steering committee. [...] Over the course of a drilling season, scores of people work at the camp, and logistics support includes airlift capabilities provided by the US Air National Guard, using Hercules transport planes owned by the National Science Foundation. [...] In 2015 the EastGRIP team moved the camp facilities from NEEM, a previous Greenland ice core drilling site, to the EastGRIP site. [...] Drilling is expected to continue until at least 2020.|$|E
500|$|The International Geophysical Year (1957–1958) saw {{increased}} glaciology research {{around the}} world, {{with one of}} the high priority research targets being deep cores in polar regions. [...] SIPRE conducted pilot drilling trials in 1956 (to 305 m) and 1957 (to 411 m) at Site 2 in Greenland; the second core, with the benefit of the previous year's drilling experience, was retrieved in much better condition, with fewer gaps. [...] In Antarctica, a 307m core was drilled at Byrd Station in 1957–1958, and a 264m core at Little America V, on the Ross Ice Shelf, the following year. [...] The success of the IGY core drilling led to increased interest in improving ice <b>coring</b> capabilities, and was followed by a CRREL project at Camp Century, where in the early 1960s three holes were drilled, the deepest reaching the base of the ice sheet at 1387m in July 1966. [...] The drill used at Camp Century then went to Byrd Station, where a 2164m hole was drilled to bedrock before the drill was frozen into the borehole by sub-ice meltwater and had to be abandoned.|$|E

40|$|Most system-on-chips (SOCs) today contain {{hierarchical}} <b>cores</b> {{that have}} multiple levels of design hierarchy. An efficient wrapper design for hierarchical <b>cores</b> {{is necessary to}} facilitate modular testing of SOCs. In most of the prior work on wrapper design for embedded <b>cores,</b> all the <b>cores</b> are assumed to have a flattened hierarchy. In this paper, we present a hierarchical <b>core</b> model and a generic IEEE P 1500 -compliant wrapper architecture for hierarchical <b>cores.</b> We assume that the embedded <b>cores</b> within the hierarchical <b>cores</b> are hard <b>cores,</b> since they are wrapped by the <b>core</b> vendor a priori and {{they have their own}} TAM architecture. Unlike prior wrapper design methods that assume a single test mode for hierarchical <b>core</b> wrappers, we present a general architecture for hierarchical <b>core</b> wrappers and describe various modes of operation of the wrapper. We design reconfigurable wrappers for hierarchical <b>cores</b> that can operate efficiently in all the test modes, thereby minimizing the overall time required to test the hierarchical <b>core</b> for any given TAM width. We propose a heuristic approach {{to solve the problem of}} hierarchical <b>core</b> wrapper design, and present experimental results for two hierarchical <b>cores</b> present in an ITC’ 02 benchmark SOC. ...|$|R
