25|$|This {{determination}} {{affects the}} entire Single Audit because the auditor adjusts the examination accordingly. Since the auditor must provide an opinion {{to the federal}} government on whether the recipient and its programs complied with laws and regulations, the auditor performs sufficient tests and audit procedures (also known as audit work) to confirm the opinion is correct. Normally, the auditor greatly increases the amount of auditing for high-risk auditees, to ensure their opinion is correct. For low-risk auditees, the auditor is not as rigorous; but still recognizes that a low-risk recipient may still have <b>compliance</b> <b>issues.</b> Conversely, a high-risk determination doesn't mean the recipient is non-compliant, just that they're more likely to be.|$|E

25|$|The gradual loss {{of blood}} from the {{gastrointestinal}} tract, as well as chronic inflammation, often leads to anemia, and professional guidelines suggest routinely monitoring for anemia with blood tests repeated every three months in active disease and annually in quiescent disease. Adequate disease control usually improves anemia of chronic disease, but iron deficiency anemia should be treated with iron supplements. The form in which treatment is administered depends both on {{the severity of the}} anemia and on the guidelines that are followed. Some advise that parenteral iron be used first because patients respond to it more quickly, it is associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects, and it is not associated with <b>compliance</b> <b>issues.</b> Others require oral iron to be used first, as patients eventually respond and many will tolerate the side effects. All guidelines advise that parenteral iron should be administered in cases of severe anemia (a hemoglobin level less than 100 g/L).|$|E
25|$|The city of Asheville {{is home to}} a Duke Energy Progress {{coal power}} plant near Lake Julian. This power plant is {{designated}} as having Coal Combustion Residue Surface Impoundments with a High Hazard Potential by the EPA. In 2012 a Duke University study found high levels of arsenic and other toxins in North Carolina lakes and rivers downstream from the Asheville power plants coal ash ponds. Samples collected from coal ash waste flowing from the ponds at the Duke Energy Progress plant to the French Broad River in Buncombe County contained arsenic levels more than four times higher than the EPA drinking water standard, and levels of selenium 17 times higher than the agency's standard for aquatic life. In March 2013 the State of North Carolina sued Duke Energy Progress in order to address similar environmental <b>compliance</b> <b>issues.</b> In July 2013 Duke Energy Corp. and North Carolina environmental regulators proposed a settlement in the lawsuit that stated coal ash threatened Asheville's water supply. The settlement called for Duke to assess the sources and extent of contamination at the Riverbend power plant in Asheville. Duke would be fined $99,100 if the settlement is approved. Following the coal ash spill in Eden, NC resulting in 82,000 tons of coal ash leaking into the Dan River, the North Carolina DENR cancelled all previous settlements with Duke Energy. Duke said a stormwater drainage pipe under the utility's Dan River Steam Station lagoon ruptured Feb 2, allowing ash slurry to pour into the river. Duke Energy faces future legislation by Tom Apodaca, republican NCGA Senate leader forcing them to clean up their south Asheville coal ash ponds. Tom Apodaca expects the legislation will be filed as soon as the General Assembly returns to session in May 2014. Apodaca expects the ponds will be cleaned up in 5–10 years under his law.|$|E

2500|$|Allegheny {{requires}} {{students to}} choose a minor {{as well as a}} major and encourages [...] "unusual combinations" [...] of majors and minors. A student's major can be in the humanities, social sciences or natural sciences, but that student's minor must be in a different division than his or her major. A reporter explained: [...] "a student enrolled in a humanities major such as English, art, or religious studies, would still take 20 to 24 credits – five to six courses – of science-related study if they decided to pick their minor within the natural sciences division... Even if they don't, they still are required to pick two courses from within the natural science areas. One of those science courses must be a lab class." [...] The interdisciplinary approach is reflected in how graduates have fared with their careers. For example, Kathleen Harrill earned degrees in music and psychology at Allegheny, and used them to become a music therapist to help children diagnosed with autism; her 300-page thesis on music and healing won recognition. Another graduate studied both English and bioethics at Allegheny, and became a lawyer at Bayer corporation helping to work on ethics and <b>compliance</b> <b>issues.</b> One student who wanted to become a special education teacher found a new love of documentary filmmaking after majoring in communication arts; her senior film [...] "Finding Matty's Voice" [...] won the Best Documentary and Grand Jury prizes at the Ivy Film Festival at Brown University in 2008. There is some debate at Allegheny about requiring scientific-related coursework and whether there should be an emphasis on [...] "scientific literacy".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the empirical literature on the transfer pricing behavior of multinational firms. Previous research mainly focuses on transfer pricing {{as a means of}} tax optimization. Our approach concentrates on transfer pricing as a critical <b>compliance</b> <b>issue.</b> Specifically, we investigate whether and to what extent the awareness of transfer pricing as a tax <b>compliance</b> <b>issue</b> responds to country and industry characteristics as well as firm-specifics. Empirically, the transfer pricing risk awareness is measured as a professional assessment reported by the person with ultimate responsibility for transfer pricing in their company. Based on a unique global survey conducted by a Big 4 accounting firm in 2007 and 2008, we estimate the number of firms reporting transfer pricing being the largest risk issue with regard to subsequent tax payments. We find that transfer pricing risk awareness depends on variables accounting for general tax and transfer pricing specific strategies, the types and characteristics of intercompany transactions the multinational firms are involved in, their individual transfer pricing compliance efforts and resources dedicated to transfer pricing matters.

40|$|AbstractThe ICT industry, and {{specifically}} critical sectors such as healthcare, transportation, energy and government require as mandatory the compliance of the ICT systems and services with legislation and regulation, {{as well as}} with standards. In the era of cloud computing, and particularly in a public cloud scenario, this <b>compliance</b> management <b>issue</b> is exacerbated by the distributed nature of the system and by the limited control of the customer on the infrastructure/services. Also if the cloud industry is aware of this legislation/regulation <b>compliance</b> <b>issue</b> (e. g. the compliance program of Amazon, Google and Microsoft Azure), right now, there are nor reference architectures neither mechanisms capable to check and to assure, off-line and at run-time, that the compliance is guaranteed during the whole life cycle of a cloud service. Cloud service brokerage can {{play an important role in}} law/regulation compliance management of cloud services. In this paper we propose a broker-based solution for the management of law/regulation compliance. In the specific first we define a reference architecture for a legislation-aware cloud service broker, and second we propose an autonomic manager that integrate the MAPE-K control loop with the LegEx framework for the management of the legal compliance checking lifecycle...|$|R
