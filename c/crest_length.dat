40|$|Chewing {{efficiency}} {{has been}} associated with fitness in mammals, yet {{little is known about the}} behavioral, ecological, and morphological factors that influence chewing efficiency in wild animals. Although research has established that dental wear and food material properties independently affect chewing efficiency, few studies have addressed the interaction among these factors. We examined chewing efficiency, measured as mean fecal particle size, as a function of seasonal shifts in diet (and corresponding changes in food fracture toughness) in a single breeding population of a grazing primate, the gelada monkey, at Guassa, Ethiopia. We also measured dental topographic traits (slope, angularity, and relief index) and relative twoand three-dimensional shearing <b>crest</b> <b>lengths</b> in a crosssectional wear series of gelada molars. Chewing efficiency decreased during the dry season, a pattern corresponding to the consumption of foods with higher fracture toughness. Older individuals experienced the most pronounced decreases in chewing efficiency between seasons, implicating dental wear as a causal factor. This pattern is consistent with our finding that dental topographic metrics and three-dimensional relative shearing <b>crest</b> <b>lengths</b> were lowest at the last stage of wear. Integrating these lines of behavioral, ecological, and morphological evidence provides some of the first empirical support for the hypothesis that food fracture toughness and dental wear together contribute to chewing efficiency. Geladas have the highest chewing efficiencies measured thus far in primates, and may be analogous to equids in their emphasis on dental design as a means of particle size reduction in the absence of highly specialized digestive physiology...|$|R

40|$|The off-shelf region between 16. 0 ° and 16. 5 °N in the {{southern}} Red Sea is identified as a new hotspot for the occurrence of oceanic internal solitary waves. Satellite observations reveal trains of solitons that, surprisingly, appear to propagate {{from the center of}} the Red Sea, where it is deepest, toward the continental shelf, but they do not survive as coherent structures over the shelf. These solitons are characterized by coherent <b>crest</b> <b>lengths</b> exceeding 80 km and crest-to-crest distances of more than 2 km, compatible with signatures of large-amplitude solitary waves. Despite the fact that these Red Sea solitons have large amplitudes, they appear to be generated by very weak surface tides. Tidal current velocity is only about 5 cm s– 1 over the shelf, much weaker than over other ocean shelves where similar solitary waves have been reported. The appearance of these waves over this particular geographical stretch suggests generation by a locally amplified internal tide on the main pycnocline. We consider three possible explanations for soliton generation in the Red Sea: interfacial tide resonance, local generation by internal tidal beams generated at the shelf breaks, and local generation by internal tidal beams generated at the shelf breaks but first amplified by repeated focusing reflections...|$|R
40|$|A revised wind-over-wave-coupling {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to provide a}} consistent description of the sea surface drag and heat/moister transfer coefficients, and associated wind velocity and temperature profiles. The spectral distribution of short wind waves in the decimeter to a few millimeters range of wavelengths is introduced based on the wave action balance equation constrained using the Yurovskaya et al. (2013) optical field wave measurements. The model is capable to reproduce fundamental statistical properties of the sea surface, such as the mean square slope and the spectral distribution of breaking <b>crests</b> <b>length.</b> The surface stress accounts for the effect of airflow separation due to wave breaking, which enables a better fit of simulated form drag to observations. The wave breaking controls the overall energy losses for the gravity waves, but also the generation of shorter waves including the parasitic capillaries, thus enhancing the form drag. Breaking wave contribution to the form drag increases rapidly at winds above 15 m/s where it exceeds the nonbreaking wave contribution. The overall impact of wind waves (breaking and nonbreaking) leads to a sheltering of the near-surface layer where the turbulent mixing is suppressed. Accordingly, the air temperature gradient in this sheltered layer increases to maintain the heat flux constant. The resulting deformation of the air temperature profile tends to lower the roughness scale for temperature compared to its value over the smooth surface...|$|R

The feet, as well as the tarsi conjointly with the middle toe, have likewise in most cases become reduced; and this it is probable has been caused by their lessened use; but the existence of some sort of correlation between the feet and beak is shown more plainly than the effects of disuse.

40|$|Breaking waves play an {{important}} role in air-sea interaction : enhancing momentum flux from the atmosphere to the ocean, dissipating wave energy that is then available for turbulent mixing, injecting aerosols and sea spray into the atmosphere, and affecting air-sea gas transfer due to air entrainment. In this thesis observations are presented of the occurrence of breaking waves under conditions of strong winds (10 - 25 ms⁻¹) and fetch-limited seas (0 - 500 km) in the Gulf of Tehuantepec Experiment in 2004. An airborne nadir-looking video camera, along with a global positioning system (GPS) and inertial motion unit (IMU), provided digital videos of the breaking sea surface in an earth frame. In particular, we present observations of Lambda (c) dc, which is the distribution of breaking wave <b>crest</b> <b>lengths</b> per unit sea surface area, binned by breaking velocity increments dc. Methods of analyzing visible images of the sea surface to yield Lambda(c) are studied. The results from previous field observations of Lambda(c) give qualitatively different results : Melville and Matusov (2002) find an exponential form for Lambda(c), while Gemmrich et al. (2008) obtain a function that peaks at intermediate speeds and falls of for high and low speeds, and at higher speeds is up to an order of magnitude higher than Melville and Matusov (2002). Two independent processing techniques for determining Lambda(c) from video images are implemented, and it is shown that the results from both studies can qualitatively be obtained when the assumptions built into the processing of the previous studies are used. The effects of surface currents, long wave orbital velocity, and the relationship between the speed of the foam patch and the underlying intrinsic phase speed are addressed. The appropriateness and limitations of comparison of the first moment of Lambda(c) to the breaking rate are explored. The spectrally resolved Lambda(c) as well as bulk measurements of whitecap coverage and breaking rate are presented for a range of wind speeds and sea states. Observations are compared to Phillips' (1985) model of Lambda(c) in the equilibrium range of the wave spectrum. The observed Lambda(c) distributions are described well by the Rayleigh distribution for slow and intermediate speeds, yet fall above the Rayleigh distribution for the fastest breaking speeds. The dimensionless width of the Lambda(c) distribution increases weakly with dimensionless fetch, while the total length of breaking per unit sea surface area decreases with dimensionless fetch for intermediate to fully-developed seas. The integral and the first two moments of Lambda(c) show a strong correlation with the active whitecap coverage and active breaking rate. The active whitecap coverage falls in the range of previous observations, but with a stronger dependence on wind speed. The breaking rate plotted against the spectral peak steepness is in agreement with previous observations (Banner et al., 2000) ...|$|R
40|$|Search of the Voyager {{images of}} Jupiter reveals {{a class of}} {{mesoscale}} waves occurring near the extrema of the zonal velocity profile between latitudes 30 deg S and 30 deg N. The average horizontal wavelength is 300 km, compared to an atmospheric scale height of 20 km; the standard deviation about the mean is only 20 percent. The alignment of most wave trains is nearly zonal, i. e., wave crests are north-south. A typical wave packet is 20 wave <b>crests</b> in <b>length</b> and 1300 km wide. Modeling shows that the waves propagate in a duct below the ammonia condensation level (the visible clouds).

The duct is topped by a trapping layer, the ammonia clouds, where the Richardson number is less than 0. 25. Meridional trapping of the wave packets is due to the shear in the zonal wind. It is speculated that the period of the waves is diurnal and that they do not propagate poleward of latitudes + or - 30 deg because the Coriolis frequency exceeds the duct Brunt frequency. The waves might be excited by diurnal variations of moist convective activity in the ammonia clouds...|$|R
