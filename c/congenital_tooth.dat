40|$|<b>Congenital</b> <b>tooth</b> {{agenesis}} {{in human}} {{is characterized by}} failure of tooth development during tooth organogenesis. 300 genes in mouse and 30 genes in human {{so far have been}} known to regulate tooth development. However, candidature of only 5 genes viz. PAX 9, MSX 1, AXIN 2, WNT 10 A and EDA have been experimentally established for congenitally missing teeth like hypodontia and oligodontia. In this study an Indian family with multiple <b>congenital</b> <b>tooth</b> agenesis was identified. Pattern of inheritance was apparently autosomal dominant type with a rare possibility to be X-linked. Whole genome sequencing of two affected individuals was carried out which revealed 119 novel non-synonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) distributed among 117 genes. Out of these only one variation (c. 956 G. T) located at exon 9 of X-linked EDA gene was considered as pathogenic and validated among all the affected and unaffected family members and unrelated controls. This variation leads to p. Ser 319 Ile change in the TNF homology domain of EDA (transcript variant 1) protein. In silico analysis predicts that this Ser 319 is well conserved across different vertebrate species and a part of putative receptor binding site. Structure based homology modeling predicts that this amino acid residue along with four other amino acid residues nearby, those when mutated known to cause selective tooth agenesis, form a cluster that may have functional significance. Taken together these results suggest that c. 956 G. T (p. Ser 319 Ile) mutation plausibly reduces th...|$|E

40|$|Transcription factors PAX 9 and MSX 1 play crucial {{roles in}} the {{development}} of permanent teeth at the bud stage, and their loss-of-function variants have been associated with <b>congenital</b> <b>tooth</b> agenesis. We sequenced the coding regions of the PAX 9 and MSX 1 genes from nine patients with non-syndromic tooth agenesis, and identified a missense mutation, P 20 L, of PAX 9 in a single familial case involving three patients in two generations. Identical mutation was previously reported by other authors, but has not been characterized in detail. The mutation was located in a highly conserved N-terminal subdomain of the paired domain and co-segregated as a heterozygote with tooth agenesis. The patients showed defects primarily in the first and second molars, which is typical for cases attributable to PAX 9 mutation. Luciferase reporter assay using the 2. 3 -kb promoter region of BMP 4 and electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the CD 19 - 2 (A-ins) sequence revealed that P 20 L substitution eliminated most of the transactivation activity and specific DNA binding activity of PAX 9 under the experimental conditions we employed, while some residual activity of the mutant was evident in the former assay. The hypomorphic nature of the variant may explain the relatively mild phenotype in this case, as compared with other PAX 9 pathogenic variants such as R 26 W...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Both X-linked hypohidrotic {{ectodermal}} dysplasia (XLHED) and non-syndromic tooth agenesis (NSTA) result in symptoms of <b>congenital</b> <b>tooth</b> loss. This study investigated genetic causes in two families with XLHED and four families with NSTA. We screened for mutations of WNT 10 A, EDA, EDAR, EDARADD, PAX 9, MSX 1, AXIN 2, LRP 6, and WNT 10 B through Sanger sequencing. Whole exome sequencing was performed for the proband of NSTA Family 4. Novel mutation c. 1051 G>T (p. Val 351 Phe) and the known mutation c. 467 G>A (p. Arg 156 His) of Ectodysplasin A (EDA) {{were identified in}} families with XLHED. Novel EDA receptor (EDAR) mutation c. 73 C>T (p. Arg 25 *), known EDA mutation c. 491 A>C (p. Glu 164 Ala), and known Wnt family member 10 A (WNT 10 A) mutations c. 511 C>T (p. Arg 171 Cys) and c. 742 C>T (p. Arg 248 *) were identified in families with NSTA. The novel EDA and EDAR mutations were predicted as being pathogenic through bioinformatics analyses and structural modeling. Two variants of WNT 10 A, c. 374 G>A (p. Arg 125 Lys) and c. 125 A>G (p. Asn 42 Ser), were found in patients with NSTA. The two WNT 10 A variants were predicted to affect the splicing of message RNA, but minigene experiments showed normal splicing of mutated minigenes. This study uncovered the genetic foundations with respect to six families with XLHED or NSTA. We identified six mutations, of which two were novel mutations of EDA and EDAR.

40|$|<b>Congenital</b> <b>tooth</b> {{agenesis}} {{is caused}} by mutations in the MSX 1, PAX 9, WNT 10 A, or AXIN 2 genes. Here, we report a Japanese family with nonsyndromic tooth agenes{{is caused by}} a novel nucleotide substitution in the intronic region between exons 1 and 2 of the MSX 1 gene. Because the mutation is located 9 [*]bp before exon 2 (c. 452 - 9 G>A), we speculated that the nucleotide substitution would generate an abnormal splice site. Using cDNA analysis of an immortalized patient blood cell, we confirmed that an additional 7 -nucleotide sequence was inserted at the splice junction between exons 1 and 2 (c. 451 _ 452 insCCCTCAG). The consequent frameshift generated a homeodomain-truncated MSX 1 (p. R 151 fsX 20). We then studied the subcellular localization of truncated MSX 1 protein in COS cells, and observed {{that it had a}} whole cell distribution more than a nuclear localization, compared to that of wild-type protein. This result suggests a deletion of the nuclear localization signal, which is mapped to the MSX 1 homeodomain. These results indicate that this novel intronic nucleotide substitution is the cause of tooth agenesis in this family. To date, most MSX 1 variants isolated from patients with tooth agenesis involve single amino acid substitutions in the highly conserved homeodomain or deletion mutants caused by frameshift or nonsense mutations. We here report a rare case of an intronic mutation of the MSX 1 gene responsible for human tooth agenesis. In addition, the missing tooth patterns were slightly but significantly different between an affected monozygotic twin pair of this family, showing that epigenetic or environmental factors also affect the phenotypic variations of missing teeth among patients with nonsyndromic tooth agenesis caused by an MSX 1 haploinsufficiency...|$|E
40|$|<b>Congenital</b> <b>tooth</b> {{agenesis}} is {{the most}} common developmental anomaly in man. More severe forms of tooth agenesis (> 5 missing teeth) demand lengthy and expensive treatment approaches such as bone augmentation surgeries and placement of multiple implants. Tooth agenesis is caused by mutations in genes responsible for early tooth development; and ever since it had been shown that timely injections of functional recombinant gene products can overcome the corresponding, mutation-based developmental disorder, such new therapeutic strategies for the prevention of tooth agenesis should be attempted. In this research project I have pursued two objectives: 1.) Basic research into the molecular genetics and therapeutics of the tooth agenesis gene PAX 9. Since PAX 9 is an intra-cellular transcription factor which cannot be replaced directly, suitable downstream targets for therapy have to be identified by comparing wild type and Pax 9 deficient tooth organs. 2.) Clinically oriented research into the molecular diagnostics of human tooth agenesis. We use candidate gene sequencing in large numbers of people with tooth agenesis to identify the majority of human tooth agenesis genes and to determine the molecular cause of tooth agenesis in individuals. In the first study I identify the genes and pathways that are affected by Pax 9 deficiency using microarray and q-PCR technology, and find that the Fgf, Shh and Wnt pathways are more affected than Bmp 4 which had previously been considered the main target of Pax 9 in tooth development. The next study shows {{that it is possible to}} apply therapeutic approaches to unravel the complexity of molecular signaling within the developing craniofacial complex. Using small molecule Wnt therapies we are able to rescue palatal clefting in Pax 9 -deficient mice. Our third study presents a clinical aspect of human molecular genetics where we establish that tooth agenesis does not predispose women to ovarian cancer, as had been previously suggested. The last study shows that mutations in WNT 10 A, but not in WNT 10 B or WNT 6, are highly prevalent in populations with tooth agenesis. We also suggest that there must be some kind of heterozygous advantage to retaining mutations in Wnt 10 a. However, that advantage has not been identified...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Although the de-velopment {{of normal}} {{dentition}} has been explored extensively, the mechanisms underlying congenitally missing teeth {{are far less}} understood. The hypothesis: <b>Congenital</b> absence of <b>teeth</b> occurs due to arrested development of a tooth primordium followed by involution, only at a stages preceding mineralized tissue formation. Evaluation of the hypothesis: We compared H & E stained serial sagittal sections of wild-type and EL mice that are congenitally missing 3 rd molars (3 M). 3 M development was followed longitudinally in both types of mice. Occurrence of apoptosis was examined using a fluorescent TUNEL assay. To determine if a similar process might account for congenital ab-sence of human teeth, we examined serial radiographs of developing dentitions. In EL mice, congenital absence of 3 M is caused, not by a failure of initiation of tooth development rather; tooth development is initiated and subsequently ar-rested during early cap stage. This arrested tooth primordium is subsequently removed physiologically by apoptosis. Examination of serial radiographs where missing teeth were identified lent further evi-dence to support this hypothesis. Follicle spaces, with no calcified tissue within them, were noted at early stages which were seen to remodel and eventually blend with adjacent bone. Permanent teeth failed to develop in those locations. Based on the animal and human data, we propose a new model for <b>congenital</b> absence of <b>teeth.</b> Validation of this model could have profound clinical implications. If the genetic me-chanisms involved in this proposed mechanism can be elucidated, it might lead to non-surgical management of supernumerary teeth...|$|R
