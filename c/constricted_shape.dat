500|$|Ida is a {{distinctly}} elongated asteroid, with an irregular surface. Ida is 2.35 {{times as long}} as it is wide, and a [...] "waist" [...] separates it into two geologically dissimilar halves. This <b>constricted</b> <b>shape</b> is consistent with Ida being made of two large, solid components, with loose debris filling the gap between them. However, no such debris was seen in high-resolution images captured by Galileo. Although there are a few steep slopes tilting up to about 50° on Ida, the slope generally does not exceed 35°. Ida's irregular shape is responsible for the asteroid's very uneven gravitational field. The surface acceleration is lowest at the extremities because of their high rotational speed. It is also low near the [...] "waist" [...] because the mass of the asteroid is concentrated in the two halves, away from this location.|$|E

This gave it a peculiarly narrow and <b>constricted</b> <b>shape,</b> consisting of little more than the axis of Wapping High Street and some north-south side streets. John Stow, the 16th century historian, described it as a [...] "continual street, or a filthy strait passage, with alleys of small tenements or cottages, built, inhabited by sailors' victuallers". A chapel to St. John the Baptist was built in 1617, and it was here that Thomas Rainsborough was buried. Wapping was constituted as a parish in 1694 ...|$|E

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{study the}} flow of a quasi-two-dimensional emulsion through a <b>constricting</b> hopper <b>shape.</b> Our area fractions range from 0. 83 to 0. 99, such that the droplets are always in contact {{with one another and}} are in many cases highly deformed. At the lowest flow rates, the droplets exit the hopper via intermittent avalanches. At the highest flow rates, the droplets exit continuously. The transition between these two types of behaviors is a fairly smooth function of the mean strain rate. The avalanches are characterized by a power law distribution of the time interval between droplets exiting the hopper, with long intervals between the avalanches. There is little or no dependence of the flow behavior on the area fraction of the system...|$|R
50|$|When {{a patient}} has a <b>constricted</b> (oval <b>shape)</b> maxilla, but normal mandible, many orthodontists request a rapid palatal expansion.This {{consists}} of the surgeon making horizontal cuts on the lateral board of the maxilla, extending anterally to the inferior border of the nasal cavity. At this time, a chisel designed for the nasal septum is utilized to detach the maxilla from the cranial base. Then, a pterygoid chisel, which is a curved chisel, is used {{on the left and}} right side of the maxilla to detach the pterygoid palates. Care must be taken as to not injure the inferior palatine artery. Prior to the procedure, the orthodontist has an orthopedic appliance attached to the maxilla teeth, bilaterally, extending over the palate with an attachment so the surgeon may use a hex-like screw to place into the device to push from anterior to posterior to start spreading the bony segments. The expansion of the maxilla may take up to 8 weeks with the surgeon advancing the expander hex lock, sideways (← →), once a week.|$|R
5000|$|Middle Cascades: Between the two obvious main plunges {{there are}} a series of five smaller plunges collectively {{referred}} to as the Middle Cascades. Taken together these account for a total drop of 675 ft, more than twice the height of the Lower Fall. Because of the narrow, <b>constricted</b> <b>shape</b> of the gorge in which these drops occur and the lack of public access, they are rarely noted. Most viewpoints in the valley miss them entirely. Several vantage points for the cascades are found along the Yosemite Falls trail. Several hikers climbing down from the trail towards the cascades have required an expensive helicopter rescue due to steep and slippery terrain and features.|$|E

30|$|Shape of {{magnetic}} hysteresis loops of the Chinese loess-paleosol sequence is variable with low-field susceptibility and is weakly constricted in samples with intermediate susceptibility (~ 1.0 × 10 − 6 m 3 /kg). The {{analyses of the}} hysteresis loops show that both low- (ferrimagnetic) and high-coercivity (antiferromagnetic) components are present and the ferrimagnetic component dominate the magnetic characteristics. The ratio of ferrimagnetic over antiferromagnetic minerals (S ratio) and the superparamagnetic fraction increase with increasing susceptibility. Neither simple two-component mixtures of ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic minerals nor of single-domain and superparamagnetic grains fully explain the constricted hysteresis loops. We interpret the variation of the loop shape with susceptibility in the following way. When {{the ratio of the}} ferrimagnetic to antiferromagnetic contribution is relatively low (low susceptibility), the broad loop is controlled by lithogenic ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic minerals. For samples with intermediate susceptibility values, <b>constricted</b> <b>shape</b> originates from an addition of a broad loop from the lithogenic fraction and a narrow loop from a pedogenic fraction with high superparamagnetic content. Then with further susceptibility increase, the <b>constricted</b> <b>shape</b> almost disappears and the loop is dominated by the pedogenic fraction. The variation of hysteresis loop shape with susceptibility can be a useful indicator of the degree of pedogenesis for loess-paleosol samples.|$|E
40|$|Epithelial bending is {{a central}} feature of {{morphogenesis}} in animals. Here we show that mutual antagonism by the small Rho GTPases Rac 1 and RhoA determines cell shape, tissue curvature, and invagination activity in the model epithelium of the developing mouse lens. The epithelial cells of the invaginating lens placode normally elongate and change from a cylindrical to an apically <b>constricted,</b> conical <b>shape.</b> RhoA mutant lens placode cells are both longer and less apically constricted than control cells, thereby reducing epithelial curvature and invagination. By contrast, Rac 1 mutant lens placode cells are shorter and more apically restricted than controls, resulting in increased epithelial curvature and precocious lens vesicle closure. Quantification of RhoA- and Rac 1 -dependent pathway markers over the apical–basal axis of lens pit cells showed that in RhoA mutant epithelial cells there was a Rac 1 pathway gain of function and vice versa. These findings suggest that mutual antagonism produces balanced activities of RhoA-generated apical constriction and Rac 1 -dependent cell elongation that controls cell shape and thus curvature of the invaginating epithelium. The ubiquity of the Rho family GTPases suggests that these mechanisms are likely to apply generally where epithelial morphogenesis occurs...|$|R
40|$|Energetics and {{quantized}} conductance in jellium modeled nanowires are investigated {{using the}} local density functional based shell correction method, extending our previous study of uniform in shape wires [C. Yannouleas and U. Landman, J. Phys. Chem. B 101, 5780 (1997) ] to wires containing a variable <b>shaped</b> <b>constricted</b> region. The energetics {{of the wire}} (sodium) {{as a function of}} the length of the volume conserving, adiabatically shaped constriction leads to formation of self selecting magic wire configurations. The variations in the energy result in oscillations in the force required to elongate the wire and are directly correlated with the stepwise variations of the conductance of the nanowire in units of 2 e^ 2 /h. The oscillatory patterns in the energetics and forces, and the correlated stepwise variation in the conductance are shown, numerically and through a semiclassical analysis, to be dominated by the quantized spectrum of the transverse states at the narrowmost part of the constriction in the wire.

5000|$|Brian Mathew {{says that}} {{many species of}} grape hyacinths, {{including}} not only Muscari but also the related Leopoldia and Pseudomuscari, are difficult to distinguish. They usually have one or more narrow leaves which arise from a bulb. The flowers appear {{in the spring and}} form a spike or raceme, being held in a close or loose spiral around a central stalk. The flowers often become less tightly spaced as the flower matures. The flower colour varies from pale blue to a very dark blue, almost black in some cases (albino forms are also known). In some species the upper flowers may be of a different colour and shape to the lower flowers. Individual flowers are composed of six fused tepals forming a spherical to obovoid <b>shape,</b> <b>constricted</b> at the end to form a mouth around which the ends of the tepals show as small lobes or [...] "teeth", which may be of a different colour {{to the rest of the}} tepal.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveA {{retrospective}} assessment {{of differences in}} congenital cholesteatoma CT findings {{with a focus on}} type of cholesteatoma mass. Materials and methodsThe medical records and CT images of 14 patients with congenital cholesteatomas in the middle ear who underwent surgery at our institution between January 2009 and July 2014 were reviewed. Cholesteatomas were classified as closed type, open type, or mixed type based on intraoperative findings. The CT findings including cholesteatoma size, location, and shape were retrospectively reviewed. ResultsEight patients had closed type cholesteatomas, four had mixed type, and two had open type. The mean size of all cholesteatomas was 5. 1 mm. None of the cholesteatoma types indicated a tendency towards a certain location. The round shape was observed more frequently in closed type cholesteatomas than in other types (closed: 5 / 8; mixed: 1 / 4; open: 0 / 2). Two large closed type cholseteatomas and two mixed type cholesteatomas exhibited a <b>constricted</b> <b>shape.</b> Both of the open type cholesteatomas displayed an irregular shape. ConclusionSmall closed type congenital cholesteatomas were typically observed as round shaped lesions, but large closed type cholesteatomas and other type cholesteatomas tended to display shapes other than round...|$|E
40|$|AbstractStage 10 of Drosophila {{oogenesis}} can be {{subdivided into}} stages 10 A and 10 B {{based on a}} change in the morphology of the centripetal follicle cells (FC) from a columnar to an apically <b>constricted</b> <b>shape.</b> This coordinated cell shape change drives epithelial cell sheet involution between the oocyte and nurse cell complex which patterns the operculum structure of the mature eggshell. We have shown previously that proper centripetal FC migration requires transient expression of the C/EBP encoded by slow border cells (slbo) at 10 A, due in part to Notch activation followed by slbo autorepression (Levine et al., 2007). Here we show that decreased slbo expression in the centripetal FC coincides with increased expression of the transcription factor Cut, a Cut/Cux/CDP family member, at 10 B. The 10 A/ 10 B temporal switch from Slbo to Cut expression is refined by both cross repression between Slbo and Cut, Slbo auto repression and Cut auto activation. High Cut levels are necessary and sufficient to direct polarized, supracellular accumulation of Actin, DE-cadherin and Armadillo associated with apical constriction of the centripetal FC. Separately, Slbo in the border cell rosette and Cut in the pole cells have antagonistic interactions to restrict Fas 2 accumulation to the pole cells, which is important for proper border cell migration. The opposing effects of Cut and Slbo in these two tissues reflect the opposing interactions between their respective mammalian homologs CAAT Displacement Protein (CDP; now CUX 1) and CAAT Enhancer Binding Protein (C/EBP) in tissue culture...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I explore {{the role of}} perceptual agency in the {{compositional}} process of four recent pieces. Perceptual agency is examined through the mechanism of the “frame” – a way of <b>constricting</b> or <b>shaping</b> the total field of possibility in ways that inform the perceptual ordering {{of the contents of}} that frame, altering their intentionality. This is seen to operate on multiple levels. Firstly with respect to the act of composition itself, which proceeds through a series of incremental stages, the aggregate result of prior stages informing the field of possibilities for – providing the frame through which to approach – each subsequent stage. In this way, the act of composition becomes a perceptual one in which arrays of possible intentionalities are gradually excavated. Secondly with respect to the choice of instrumental materials themselves, invariably chosen for their primarily modulatory capacity; that is, their ability to frame and be framed by their own context. The score, then, is an archaeological trace of the sedimentation of these layered processes, presenting (while not defining) a wide array of potential patterns of framing requiring processing and synthesis. The nature of the score engages the performer’s own perceptual agency through the learning process, analogous to the compositional process itself, as it is necessarily comprised of subsequent layers of framing. The thesis commences with a general exploration of perceptual agency, frames and intentionality against a backdrop of phenomenological and ecological writing. Having essayed the conceptual territory surrounding these core terms, there follows a detailed discussion of the compositional processes and priorities employed in the pieces contained with this thesis, focusing on the three pieces composed in 2011, {{and the manner in which}} the multi-layered approach to composition continually reframes and responds to its own results. Particular emphasis is placed on the treatment of the temporal domain, as this represents the most significant compositional and theoretical departure from common notational practice. The final part of the thesis examines the ways in which perceptual agency is engaged on the part of the performer, and concludes with a brief consideration of possible future avenues of exploration...|$|R
