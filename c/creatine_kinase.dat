5|$|The swollen, {{inflamed}} muscle may directly compress {{structures in}} the same fascial compartment, causing compartment syndrome.

Finally, destroyed muscle cells release potassium ions, phosphate ions, the heme-containing protein myoglobin, the enzyme <b>creatine</b> <b>kinase</b> and uric acid (a breakdown product of purines from DNA) into the blood. Activation of the coagulation system may precipitate disseminated intravascular coagulation. High potassium levels may lead to potentially fatal disruptions in heart rhythm.

40|$|Background: <b>Creatine</b> <b>Kinases</b> (CK) {{catalyze}} the reversible {{transfer of}} high-energy phosphate groups between ATP and phosphocreatine, thereby playing a {{storage and distribution}} role in cellular energetics. Brain-type CK (CK-B) deficiency is coupled to loss of function in neural cell circuits, altered bone-remodeling by osteoclasts and complement-mediated phagocytotic activity of macrophages, processes sharing dependency on actomyosin dynamics.

30|$|A {{recent review}} states that {{creatine}} {{is taken up}} through the blood–brain barrier in limited amounts, but that the CNS remains dependent on endogenous synthesis (Braissant 2012). We found a strong expression of <b>creatine</b> <b>kinases</b> in the brain of rainbow trout, indicating an expectedly strong energy demand and also an average expression of SLC 6 A 8 as well as GAMT. Only GATM showed a considerably lower expression in comparison to its expression in other tissues {{as well as in}} comparison to the expression of the other creatine-related genes in the brain. As the formation of GAA is the rate-limiting step of creatine synthesis (Sandell et al. 2003; Wyss & Wallimann 1994), this finding is quite unexpected. One possible explanation is that the creatine transporter CT 1 not only transports creatine to the brain but is also capable of transporting the precursor GAA as it has been described elsewhere (Tachikawa et al. 2009). In this case, the main function of CT 1 would be the transport of GAA into the brain, where it then is metabolized to creatine by the abundant GAMT.|$|R
25|$|Energy {{needed to}} perform short lasting, high {{intensity}} bursts of activity {{is derived from}} anaerobic metabolism within the cytosol of muscle cells, as opposed to aerobic respiration which utilizes oxygen, is sustainable, and occurs in the mitochondria. The quick energy sources consist of the phosphocreatine (PCr) system, fast glycolysis, and adenylate kinase. All of these systems re-synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the universal energy source in all cells. The most rapid source, but the most readily depleted of the above sources is the PCr system which utilizes the enzyme <b>creatine</b> <b>kinase.</b> This enzyme catalyzes a reaction that combines phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into ATP and creatine. This resource is short lasting because oxygen {{is required for the}} resynthesis of phosphocreatine via mitochondrial <b>creatine</b> <b>kinase.</b> Therefore, under anaerobic conditions, this substrate is finite and only lasts between approximately 10 to 30 seconds of high intensity work. Fast glycolysis, however, can function for approximately 2 minutes prior to fatigue, and predominately uses intracellular glycogen as a substrate. Glycogen is broken down rapidly via glycogen phosphorylase into individual glucose units during intense exercise. Glucose is then oxidized to pyruvate and under anaerobic condition is reduced to lactic acid. This reaction oxidizes NADH to NAD, thereby releasing a hydrogen ion, promoting acidosis. For this reason, fast glycolysis can not be sustained for long periods of time. Lastly, adenylate kinase catalyzes a reaction by which 2 ADP are combined to form ATP and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). This reaction takes place during low energy situations such as extreme exercise or conditions of hypoxia, but is not a significant source of energy. The creation of AMP resulting from this reaction stimulates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP kinase) which is the energy sensor of the cell. After sensing low energy conditions, AMP kinase stimulates various other intracellular enzymes geared towards increasing energy supply and decreasing all anabolic, or energy requiring, cell functions.|$|E

We further demonstrate that McsB is a tyrosine kinase that needs McsA to become activated. ClpC inhibits the kinase activity of McsB, indicating a direct role in initiating CtsR-controlled heat shock response. Interestingly, the kinase domain of McsB is homologous to guanidino phosphotransferase domains originating from eukaryotic arginine and <b>creatine</b> <b>kinases.</b> Mutational analysis of key residues of the guanidino kinase domain demonstrated that McsB utilizes this domain to catalyze the tyrosine phosphorylation.

40|$|International audienceHuntington's disease (HD) is an {{autosomal}} dominant neurodegenerative disorder, {{characterized by a}} prominent loss of GABA-ergic medium-sized spiny neurons in the caudate putamen. There is evidence that impaired energy metabolism contributes to neuronal death in HD. Creatine is an endogenous substrate for <b>creatine</b> <b>kinases</b> and thereby supports cellular ATP levels. This study investigated the effects of creatine supplementation (5 mm) on cell survival and neuronal differentiation in striatal cultures. Chronic creatine treatment resulted in significant increased densities of GABA-immunoreactive (-ir) neurons, although total neuronal cell number and general viability were not affected. Similar effects were seen after short-term treatment, suggesting that creatine acted as a differentiation factor. Inhibitors of transcription or translation did not abolish the creatine-mediated effects, nor did omission of extracellular calcium, whereas inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol- 3 -kinase significantly attenuated the creatine induced increase in GABA-ir cell densities. Creatine exhibited significant neuroprotection against toxicity instigated either by glucose- and serum deprivation or addition of 3 -nitropropionic acid.

This enzyme is released by damaged muscle, and levels above 1000 U/L (5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)) indicate rhabdomyolysis. More than 5,000 U/L indicates severe disease but depending on the extent of the rhabdomyolysis, concentrations up to 100,000U/l are not unusual. CK concentrations rise steadily for 12hours after the original muscle injury, remain elevated for 1–3days and then fall gradually.

There is no specific concentration of CK above which kidney impairment definitely occurs; concentrations below 20,000U/l are unlikely to be associated with a risk of kidney impairment, unless there are other contributing risk factors. Mild rises without kidney impairment are referred to as [...] "hyperCKemia". Myoglobin has a short half-life, and is therefore less useful as a diagnostic test in the later stages.

40|$|In the chicken, a {{high degree}} of {{heterogeneity}} at the protein level has been reported for the creatine kinase-type B (B-CK). Here we show that the two B-CK isoproteins, Ba- and Bb-CK, are encoded by two mRNAs, which are derived from a single copy gene by a stochastic alternative splicing mechanism. The transcription of the single hnRNA is directed by a complex promoter region containing a stretch of sequences which is highly conserved among all the B-CK genes known to date.

Results Two hr after pilocarpine (PILO) -seizure induction, ubiquitous mitochondrial CK (uMtCK) immunoreactivity was unaltered as compared to control level. However, brain-type cytoplasm CK (BCK) immunoreactivity was decreased to 70 % of control level. CRT immunoreactivity was decreased to 60 % of control level. Following Cr or Tat-CK treatment, uMtCK or CRT immunoreactivity was unaffected, while BCK immunoreactivity in Cr treated group was increased to 3. 6 -fold of control levels. β-Guanidinopropionic acid (GPA, a competitive CRT inhibitor) reduced BCK and CRT expression. In addition, Cr and tat-BCK treatment delayed the beginning of seizure activity after PILO injection. However, GPA treatment induced spontaneous seizure activity without PILO treatment. In chronic epilepsy rats, both uMtCK and CRT immunoreactivities were reduced in the hippocampus. In contrast, BCK immunoreactivity {{was similar to that}} observed in control animals.

40|$|Background: Creatine, Phosphocreatine, and <b>creatine</b> <b>kinases,</b> {{constitute}} an energy shuttle that links ATP production in mitochondria with cellular consumption sites. Myocytes and neurons cannot synthesize creatine and depend on uptake across the cell membrane by a specialized transporter to maintain intracellular creatine levels. Although {{recent studies have}} improved our understanding of creatine transport in cardiomyocytes, the structural elements underlying the creatine transporter protein regulation and the relevant intracellular signaling processes are unknown. Methods: The effects of pharmacological activation of kinases or phosphatases on creatine transport in cardiomyocytes in culture were evaluated. Putative phosphorylation sites in the creatine transporter protein were identified by bioinformatics analyses, and ablated using site-directed mutagenesis. Mutant transporter function and their responses to pharmacological PKC activation or changes in creatine availability in the extracellular environment, were evaluated. Results: PKC activation decreases creatine transport in cardiomyocytes in culture. Elimination of high probability potential phosphorylation sites did not abrogate responses to PKC activation or substrate availability. Conclusion: Modulation of creatine transport in cardiomyocytes is a complex process where phosphorylation at predicted sites in the creatine transporter protein does not significantly alter activity.

Methods We analyzed control and failing myocardium employing iTRAQ labeling, two-dimensional peptide separation combining peptide IEF and nano-HPLC with MALDI-MS/MS. For the transcriptomic analysis we employed Illumina RatRef- 12 v 1 Expression BeadChip. Results In the proteomic analysis we identified 2030 myocardial proteins, of which 66 proteins were differentially expressed. The mRNA expression analysis identified 851 differentially expressed mRNAs.
