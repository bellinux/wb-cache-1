5|$|Biological {{control is}} first {{recorded}} around 300 AD in China, when colonies of weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina, were intentionally placed in <b>citrus</b> <b>plantations</b> to control beetles and caterpillars. Also in China, ducks {{were used in}} paddy fields to consume pests, as illustrated in ancient cave art. In 1762, an Indian mynah was brought to Mauritius to control locusts, and about the same time, citrus trees in Burma were connected by bamboos to allow ants to pass between them and help control caterpillars. In the 1880s, ladybirds were used in <b>citrus</b> <b>plantations</b> in California to control scale insects, and other biological control experiments followed. The introduction of DDT, a cheap and effective compound, put an effective stop to biological control experiments. By the 1960s, problems of resistance to chemicals and damage to the environment began to emerge, and biological control had a renaissance. Chemical pest control is still the predominant type of pest control today, although {{a renewed interest in}} traditional and biological pest control developed {{towards the end of the}} 20th century and continues to this day.|$|E

40|$|The forest land’s {{conversion}} into {{tree crops}} plantations {{plays a major}} role in the loss of biodiversity. Therefore, understanding the impacts of land-use change on species diversity is very critical for ecosystem functioning and stability. This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of land-use changes on under storey species diversity in the Theobroma cacao and <b>Citrus</b> sinensis <b>plantations.</b> Two, 25 m × 25 m plots were sampled in each plantation and a nearby undisturbed secondary rainforest for comparison. The diameters (dbh- 1. 3 m) of all trees at breast height> 10 cm were measured in each plot. Five line transect were systematically laid and a quadrat of 50 cm × 50 cm placed at every 1 m point to identify the under storey species (herbaceous, shrubs, tree saplings and climbers) present in each plot. Percentage canopy, species diversity using Shannon-Wiener, Simpson’s index and Evenness were determined, while species similarity was determined using the Jaccard’s similarity index. Results indicate that woody basal area and stem density in Theobroma cacao were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than the <b>Citrus</b> sinensis <b>plantation.</b> A total number of 25, 27, and 14 under storey species distributed in 16, 19 and 11 families were found in Theobroma cacao, <b>Citrus</b> sinensis <b>plantations</b> and secondary forest respectively. Panicum maximum and Axonopus compressus were the dominant grasses in the Theobroma cacao and <b>Citrus</b> sinensis <b>plantations</b> respectively. The percentage canopy cover was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in the secondary forest than the plantations.

40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{assessing}} {{the effects of}} season on chemical composition of forages selected by sheep grazing in a <b>citrus</b> <b>plantation.</b> Forage species growing in a sweet orange (<b>Citrus</b> sinensis) <b>plantation</b> were identified and sampled monthly for 2 years. Samples were bulked on monthly basis for chemical analysis. The average dry matter content of the forages increased from the rainy to the dry season but effects of season on the chemical components were inconsistent. Some species, such as Asystasia gangetica, had a higher crude protein concentration in the dry season, whereas for others, such as Panicum repens, the reverse occurred. However, average concentrations of crude protein, detergent fiber and components of fiber for all species for the rainy season {{were not significantly different}} from the dry season values. It was concluded that there were differences among forage species in their responses to changing seasons, such that grazing ruminants may select a diet to enable them to meet their nutritional requirements, provided forage biomass is adequate.
