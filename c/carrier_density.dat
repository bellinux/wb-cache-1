By monitoring the temporal evolution of the excitonic absorption spectrum, a reduction of the quantum-confinement Stark shift was observed due to the photo-induced in-well field screening at low <b>carrier</b> <b>densities</b> and excitonic absorption quenching at high <b>carrier</b> <b>densities.</b> By comparing the differential absorption spectra at various injected <b>carrier</b> <b>densities,</b> the in-well field screening effect was distinguished from excitonic bleaching...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} {{multiband}} transport study of bilayer graphene at high <b>carrier</b> <b>densities.</b> Employing a poly(ethylene) oxide-CsClO_ 4 solid polymer electrolyte gate we demonstrate the filling {{of the high}} energy subbands in bilayer graphene samples at <b>carrier</b> <b>densities</b> |n|≥ 2. 4 × 10 ^ 13 cm^- 2. We observe a sudden increase of resistance and the onset of a second family of Shubnikov de Haas (SdH) oscillations as these high energy subbands are populated.

5000|$|In a {{semiconductor}} laser, {{the optical}} pulses are generated by injecting {{a large number}} of carriers (electrons) into the active region of the device, bringing the <b>carrier</b> <b>density</b> within that region from below to above the lasing threshold.

5000|$|However, {{carriers}} are depleted {{as a result}} of stimulated emission faster than they are injected. So the <b>carrier</b> <b>density</b> eventually falls back to below lasing threshold which results in the termination of the optical output.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to {{a study of the}} {{conductivity}} of confined charge carriers in various nanocrystalline materials. The experimental method [...] THz spectroscopy [...] involves measurements of the conductivity of carriers generated by doping or by optical excitation. In the theoretical interpretation of measured data we address important aspects of carrier transport, connected to the microscopic inhomogeneity of samples and the nanoscale confinement of carriers. We focus on the study of nanocrystalline ZnO and CdS using simulations and experiments {{in a wide range of}} <b>carrier</b> <b>densities</b> and for several temperatures. In ZnO, the interplay of highly mobile electron-hole gas, dense electron-hole plasma and population of excitons was observed. In CdS the investigation reveals the importance of clusters of nanocrystals in the electron confinement. The dynamics of the electron mobility at different <b>carrier</b> <b>densities</b> show the role of the kinetic energy of electrons and its relaxation in the carrier transport in nanostructured systems.

30|$|In the HD model, {{the energy}} balance {{equation}} {{is added to}} the above Equations 1 and 2.

This condition can be satisfied at high <b>carrier</b> <b>densities</b> (typically, at least above 1016 cm− 3). The high <b>carrier</b> <b>densities</b> can be provided either by doping or by the carrier injection from the contacts.
