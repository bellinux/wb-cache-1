A system of aggregate input demand functions for agriculture including real <b>cash</b> <b>balances</b> is formulated and estimated, assuming that producers minimize input costs {{for a given}} output level. Empirical results suggest real <b>cash</b> <b>balances</b> are an important contributor to agricultural production. Their exclusion from production studies may lead to serious specification biases.

40|$|Abstract: The basic {{financial}} {{purpose of}} corporation is creation of its value. Liquidity management should {{also contribute to}} realization of this fundamental aim. Many of the current asset management models that are found in financial management literature assume book profit maximization as the basic financial purpose. These book profit-based models could be lacking in what relates to another aim (i. e., maximization of enterprise value). The corporate value creation strategy is executed {{with a focus on}} risk and uncertainty. Firms hold cash for a variety of different reasons. Generally, <b>cash</b> <b>balances</b> held in a firm can be called considered, precautionary, speculative, transactional and intentional. The first are the result of management anxieties. Managers fear the negative part of the risk and hold cash to hedge against it. Second, <b>cash</b> <b>balances</b> are held to use chances that are created by the positive part of the risk equation. Next, <b>cash</b> <b>balances</b> are the result of the operating needs of the firm. In this article, we analyse the relation between these types of <b>cash</b> <b>balances</b> and risk. This article presents the discussion about relations between firm’s net working investment policy and as result operating <b>cash</b> <b>balances</b> and firm’s value. This article also contains propositions for marking levels of precautionary <b>cash</b> <b>balances</b> and speculative <b>cash</b> <b>balances.</b> Application of these propositions should help managers to make better decisions to maximize the value of a firm...|$|R
