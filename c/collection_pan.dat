5000|$|Hopper - The Hopper, {{commonly}} called the [...] "base" [...] serves {{as both a}} platform for the shaker and <b>collection</b> <b>pan</b> for the fluid processed by the shaker screens, also known as [...] "underflow". The hopper can be ordered according {{to the needs of}} the drilling fluid, aka [...] "mud" [...] system. It can come in different depths to accommodate larger quantities of drilling fluid as well as have different ports for returning the underflow to the mud system.|$|E
50|$|Feeder- The Feeder is {{essentially}} a <b>collection</b> <b>pan</b> for the drilling fluid before it is processed by the shaker, it can come in many different shapes and sizes to accommodate {{the needs of the}} mud system. The most commonly used feeder is known as the weir feeder, the drilling fluid enters the feeder usually through a pipe welded to the outside wall {{near the bottom of the}} feeder tank, it fills the feeder to a predetermined point and like water flowing over a dam the mud (drilling fluid) spills over the weir and onto the screening area of the shaker. This method of feeding the shaker is most widely used due to its ability to evenly distribute the mud along the entire width of the shaker allowing for maximum use of the shaker's screening deck area.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Dispersal of {{soil organisms}} {{is crucial for}} their spatial {{distribution}} and adaptation to the prevailing conditions of the Antarctic Dry Valleys. This study investigated the possibility of wind dispersal of soil invertebrates within the dry valleys. Soil invertebrates were evaluated in (1) pockets of transported sediments to lake ice and glacier surfaces, (2) wind-transported dust particles in <b>collection</b> <b>pans</b> (Bundt pans) 100 cm above the soil surface, and (3) sediments transported closer to the surface (< 50 cm) and collected in open top chambers (OTCs). Invertebrates were extracted and identified. Nematodes were identified to species and classified according to life stage and sex. Three species of nematodes were recovered and Scottnema lindsayae was the most dominant. There were more juveniles (71 %) in the transported sediments than adults (29 %). Tardi-grades and rotifers were more abundant in sediments on lake and glacier surfaces while nematodes were more abundant in the dry sediment <b>collections</b> of Bundt <b>pans</b> and OTCs. The abundance of immobile (dead) nema-todes in the Bundt pans and OTCs was three times greater than active (live) nematodes. Anhydrobiosis constitutes a survival mechanism that allows wind dis-persal of nematodes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Our results show that soil invertebrates are dispersed by wind in the Dry Valleys and are viable in ice communities on lake surfaces and glaciers...|$|R

50|$|The {{research}} on high frequency screens {{has led to}} {{new developments in the}} field which enhance the operation and performance of the equipment. These new developments include the stacking of up to 5 individual screen decks placed {{on top of the other}} and operating in parallel. A divider system splits the feed slurry to each Stack Sizer® screen, then to each screen deck on the machine. Each screen deck has an undersize and oversize <b>collection</b> <b>pan</b> which will respectively go into their common outlet. The stacking of the machines thus allows more production while using less space. Another new development is the fabrication of Polyweb urethane screen surfaces that have openings as fine as 45 µm and open areas from 35% - 45%. This leads to the screen being able to separate finer particles. The screens can be used for both wet and dry applications and urethane formulation is still an ongoing process. Thus, research and development is still being invested in high frequency screening equipment to improve the overall separation efficiency and also to lower costs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this paper, we {{describe}} a multi-class text categorization approach to authorship attribution and test it on sets of e-mail <b>collections.</b> The <b>PAN</b> 2011 competition data consists of e-mails of variable length, written by various candidate authors, with some represented by significantly longer or more e-mails than others. Rather than construct a classifier for each separate author to discriminate {{it from the}} others (i. e. binary classification), we adopt a multi-class scheme where all authorship classes are learned simultaneously. We explore {{the effect of the}} selection of feature types and of the C parameter in the SVM multiclass learning algorithm. Variable-length lexical features showed promising results, nevertheless our authorship attribution approach only scored a mid position amongst the other competitors, for the SMALL as well as the LARGE test sets...|$|R
40|$|Soil piping {{has been}} {{attributed}} {{as a potential}} mechanism of instability of embankments and streambanks. Limited field work has been conducted on quantifying and modeling pipeflow and internal erosion processes in the field with either natural or artificially created soil pipes. This research utilized an innovative constant-head trench system to conduct constant-head soil pipe experiments in two contrasting streambanks: Dry Creek in northern Mississippi and Cow Creek in northern Oklahoma. Experiments included open pipes, in which the soil pipe was directly connected to the constant- head trench and open at the streambank face, and clogged pipes, which involved plugging the outlet of the soil pipe using soil excavated adjacent to the pipe. A tensiometer network {{was used to measure}} soil water pressures surrounding open and clogged pipe outlets on the streambank face. When pipeflow occurred, flow and sediment samples were collected using flow <b>collection</b> <b>pans</b> to quantify sediment concentrations. Flow and sediment data were used with an existing turbulent pipeflow and internal erosion model to estimate erodibility and critical shear stress properties of the soils, which were subsequently compared to similar properties derived from jet erosion tests. Clogged soil pipes resulted in pore water pressure increases in the soil adjacent to the pipe, which generally remained below saturation during these experimental periods, except at locations close to the plug. Depending on the density of the plugged soil material, the clogged soil pipes either burst, resulting in turbulent pipeflow, or were manually punctured to establish pipeflow. Calibrated critical shear stress from the turbulent pipeflow and internal erosion model matched that observed from jet erosion tests for the less erodible soils on the Dry Creek streambank, where sediment concentrations were consistently below 2 g L- 1 even with fairly large hydraulic gradients on the pipe (0. 3 m m- 1). Calibrated erodibility coefficients were much smaller than those measured with jet erosion tests. For the more erodible streambank soils of Cow Creek, sediment concentrations approached 40 g L- 1. There is a need for improved pipeflow modeling that accounts for rapidly changing pipe geometries, partially filled soil pipes, and pipeflow/soil matrix interactions...|$|R
50|$|Two English dubbed {{versions}} {{were released}} directly to VHS and Laserdisc in 1995 by SMV Enterprises in North America: a tamer PG-13 version, and an unrated cut which contains, among other things, {{a slightly more}} revealing shower scene featuring Chun-Li that is still censored from the original Japanese version. The movie was released in Australia and the United Kingdom by Manga Entertainment UK under license from Capcom. Manga's UK release is censored {{in a similar way}} to the US version, yet profanity is retained and is rated 15 by the BBFC. Manga's Australian release is entirely uncut and is rated M by the ACB. In addition, a slightly different version of the movie appears in both the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions of the Street Fighter Anniversary Collection as a bonus feature accessible from Hyper Street Fighter IIs Gallery Mode. It is more censored than the PG-13 version in terms of language, and contains some other minor edits not related to mature or vulgar content. The American VHS releases and the version in the North American Street Fighter Anniversary <b>Collection</b> were <b>pan</b> and scan while the Region 1 DVD has non-anamorphic widescreen. The European VHS version is non-anamorphic widescreen. These localized English versions replaced the original Japanese soundtrack in favor of licensed, popular alternative, Western soundtracks from KMFDM, Korn, Alice in Chains, Silverchair, and other bands, as well an instrumental score.|$|R
40|$|Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) {{atmospheric}} concentration {{samples were collected}} hourly from an ocean vessel 50 mi off the continental coast traveling from Seattle to Chile in 1984. Air concentration data for PAN and light hydrocarbons (LHC) were also taken by aircraft {{in the same period}} over Wyoming and Colorado and over the eastern Pacific. The PAN concentrations were higher and more variable in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere, increased with altitude, and were higher in the winter than in summer. The summer PAN concentrations were higher in the continental troposphere than in the marine troposphere. The results show that photochemical models of the atmosphere which do not account for the reaction between nonmethane hydrocarbons and PAN will probably overestimate the abundances of NO(x) and HNO 3. The <b>collection</b> of further <b>PAN</b> concentration data is recommended as a means to characterizing the moderating role of PAN in the photochemistry of the troposphere...|$|R
5000|$|The {{activities}} of the PAU are closely connected with the Archives of the Science of the PAN and of the PAU. Besides the <b>PAN's</b> <b>collection</b> (starting from 1953) the Archives gather also files of the Kraków Learned Society and other Kraków societies, and, first of all, of the Academy of Arts and Sciences (since 1872) and the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences (1920-1952 and from 1989). The collection contains also numerous legacies of many scholars, not only those who were the PAU members. As {{a consequence of the}} agreement between the PAN and the PAU, since 1 April 2002, the former Warsaw Branch of the Archives of the Polish Academy of Sciences has been functioning under the name of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences in Kraków. The Archives belong to the structure of the PAN Branch in Kraków but have their own Council appointed and financed by both the academies. Besides storing, working out the collected items and making them available for researches, the Archives systematically organize various exhibitions and scientific conferences. They also publish the PAU series entitled [...] "In the Service of Science". The Archives work in close cooperation with the PAU's Commission on the History of Science.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} common bee genera in the Niagara Region, the genus Ceratina (Hymenoptera: Apidae) is {{composed}} of four species, C. dupla, C. calcarata, the very rare C. strenua, and a previously unknown species provisionally named C. near dupla. The primary goal of this thesis was to investigate how these closely related species coexist with one another in the Niagara ~ee community. The first necessary step was to describe and compare the nesting biologies and life histories of the three most common species, C. dupla, C. calcarata and the new C. near dupla, which was conducted in 2008 via nest <b>collections</b> and <b>pan</b> trapping. Ceratina dupla and C. calcarata were common, each comprising 49 % of the population, while C. near dupla was rare, comprising only 2 % of the population. Ceratina dupla and C. near dupla both nested more commonly in teasel (Dipsacus sp.) in the sun, occasionally in raspberry (Rubus sp.) in the shade, and never in shady sumac (Rhus sp.), while C. calcarata nested most commonly in raspberry and sumac (shaded) and occasionally in teasel (sunny). Ceratina near dupla differed from both C. dupla and C. calcarata in that it appeared to be partially bivoltine, with some females founding nests very early and then again very late in the season. To examine the interactions and possible competition for nests that may be taking place between C. dupla and C. calcarata, a nest choice experiment was conducted in 2009. This experiment allowed both species to choose among twigs from all three substrates in the sun and in the shade. I then compared the results from 2008 (where bees chose from what was available), to where they nested when given all options (2009 experiment). Both C. dupla and C. calcarata had the same preferences for microhabitat and nest substrate in 2009, that being raspberry and sumac twigs in the sun. As that microhabitat and nest substrate combination is extremely rare in nature, both species must make a choice. In nature Ceratina dupla nests more often in the preferred microhabitat (sun), while C. calcarata nests in the preferred substrate (raspberry). Nesting in the shade also leads to smaller clutch sizes, higher parasitism and lower numbers of live brood in C. calcarata, suggesting that C. dupla may be outcompeting C. calcarata for the sunny nesting sites. The development and host preferences of Ceratina parasitoids were also examined. Ceratina species in Niagara were parasitized by no less than eight species of arthropod. Six of these were wasps from the superfamily Chalcidoidea (Hymenoptera), one was a wasp from the family Ichneumonidae (Hymenoptera) and one was a physogastric mite from the family Pyemotidae (Acari). Parasites shared a wide range of developmental strategies, from ichneumonid larvae that needed to consume multiple Ceratina immatures to complete development, to the species from the Eulophidae (Baryscapus) and Encyrtidae (Coelopencyrtus), in which multiple individuals completed development inside a single Ceratina host. Biological data on parasitoids is scarce in the scientific literature, and this Chapter documents these interactions for future research...|$|R
