In March 1993, the <b>coupling</b> <b>head</b> of lithotriptor was {{upgraded}} from "standard-tube" to "C-tube". The C-tube has approximately two times or more destructive energy and intensity than the standard-tube. In this study, we analyzed the clinical results according to type of <b>coupling</b> <b>head</b> in 713 cases treated by ESWL monotherapy and evaluated 3 {{months after the}} initial treatment. The overall success rate at 3 months after ESWL was 85 % in the standard-tube cases and 93 % in the C-tube cases; the stone-free rate was 72 % and 82 %, respectively. There were no cases in {{which had to be}} discontinued due to ESWL severe side effects. However, in 66. 1 % of the C-tube cases and 31. 1 % of the standard-tube cases, a sufficient destructive intensity could not be used because of pain. Within a group that received sufficient destructive intensity, the C-tube was able to reduce both duration of the procedure and the number of shots to two thirds of that of the standard-tube...|$|E
40|$|A {{streamer}} coupling {{theory is}} developed {{to describe the}} formation of homogenous emission, and the high moving speed of emission patterns in high pressure discharges. By considering the effects of both electron diffusion and electronic drift in the streamer head, the minimum required preionization level n_ min {{for the formation of}} streamer coupling is found to depend on electric field strength, gas pressure and electron temperature. The homogeneity and moving speed of the emission pattern in streamer <b>coupling</b> <b>head</b> increase with preionization level n_ 0, when n_ 0 > n_ min.

40|$|American Musicological Society annual meeting, San Francisco, 10 Nov. 2011 Critics love to tout {{the pure}} sound of early music. Think Emma Kirkby. <b>Coupling</b> <b>head</b> voice with minimal vibrato evokes sexual purity and innocence (Yri), or disembodied angels (Grieg). As the term ‘white tone’ suggests, purity is {{connected}} with race and historically it also indicated class. It is a neutral sound, lacking ‘grain’ (Barthes), against which others are measured. The dominant vocal sound of women early music singers thus carries intersecting gender, class and racial connotations. This paper examines early music vocal ensemble performing practice in Britain since the 1950 s in relation to race. It focuses on the interplay of difference and sameness through the discourse of purity {{and the practice of}} blending. I argue that aspects of the practice and its reception are rooted in unmarked whiteness. Britain’s early music movement introduced a new sound world through repertoire, historically-informed techniques and experimentation with multicultural musics. To mixed reception, Musica Reservata used folk and world instruments and vocal techniques. As John Potter noted, the choral-scholar sound of the Early Music Consort of London eclipsed Jantina Noorman’s ‘holler’ (Brown); the Anglican a capella sound became the quintessential sound of British early music vocal ensembles. Class and gender axes of difference within the practice are well documented but there is an elephant in the room: whiteness. Like Victorian voice culture the balanced, blended sound (achieved with modified Received Pronunciation and matched enunciation) minimizes difference, maximizes sameness, promotes assimilation, and reflects the relative homogeneity of the ensembles that initially defined the sound. In effect, it is the sound of an elite whiteness, one that contrasts with diverse singing traditions (e. g. Gaelic psalm singing, shape note singing, musical theatre and pop singing). The paper ends by taking on the attempt at multiculturalism that now permeates the British early music movement. Although originating in anti-racism, rather than decentering whiteness, such fusion might serve to highlight it without dismantling power structures embedded in the sound. British early music practice may not be ready to be an equal multicultural partner until it addresses the `waves of sameness’ (Deleuze and Guattari) in the early music vocal sound...|$|E

40|$|The elastic {{properties}} of oil/water/surfactant interfaces {{play an important}} role in the phase behaviour of microemulsions and for the stability of macroemulsions. The aim of this thesis is to obtain an understanding of the relationship between the structure of the surfactant molecules, the structure of the interface, and macroscopic interfacial properties. To achieve this aim, we performed molecular simulations of oil/water/surfactant systems. We made a quantitative comparison of various model surfactants to determine how structural changes affect interfacial properties and film rupture. The model consists of water, oil, head, and tail beads, and surfactants are constructed by <b>coupling</b> <b>head</b> and tail beads with harmonic springs. We used a hybrid dissipative particle dynamics-Monte Carlo scheme. The former was used to simulate particle trajectories and the Monte Carlo scheme was used to mimic experimental conditions: bulk-interface phase equilibrium, tensionless interfaces in microemulsions, and the surface force apparatus. A detailed comparison of various non-ionic model surfactants showed how structural changes affect interfacial properties: Comparison between linear and branched surfactants showed that the efficiency of adsorption is higher for linear surfactants, although branched surfactants are more efficient at a given surface density. Linear surfactants can be more efficient also at the same surface density if the head group is sufficiently soluble in oil, because low head-oil repulsion makes the branched isomers stagger at the interface. The bending rigidity is higher for linear surfactants. Furthermore, branched surfactants make oil droplets coalesce more easily than linear surfactants do, but linear and branched surfactants have roughly the same effect on water droplet coalescence. Comparison of linear surfactants with varying chain lengths showed that longer surfactants have a lower surface tension and higher bending rigidity. The increase in rigidity with chain length follows a power law, but the exponent is higher for surfactant monolayers at a fixed density than at a fixed tension. Longer tails and/or denser monolayers influence the stability of water droplets in a positive direction, and the stability of oil droplets in a negative direction. Addition of cosurfactant showed that mixed monolayers have a lower bending rigidity than pure monolayers at the same average chain length and tension. Cosurfactants have a negative effect on the stability of water droplets, and a positive effect on the stability of oil droplets. Paper I reprinted with kind permission of EDP Sciences.
