5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} can be {{described}} by the ovarian or uterine cycle. The ovarian cycle describes <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> in the follicles of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the endometrial lining of the uterus. Both cycles {{can be divided into}} three phases. The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase whereas the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.|$|E
5|$|The TNA Television Championship was a {{professional}} wrestling championship owned by the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) professional wrestling promotion. Being {{a professional}} wrestling championship, it is won via a scripted ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline. All title changes have occurred at TNA-promoted events thus far. Title <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> on TNA's television program Impact Wrestling (also known as TNA Impact! until May3, 2011) usually air on tape delay and as such are listed with the day the tapings occurred, rather than the air date.|$|E

25|$|The {{amygdala}} is {{an important}} brain structure {{when it comes to}} learning fearful responses, in other words, it influences how people remember traumatic things. An increase in blood flow to this area has been shown when people look at scary faces, or remember traumatic events. Research has also shown that the lateral nucleus of the amygdala is a crucial site of neural <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> during fear conditioning.|$|E
25|$|In {{opposition}} to the Disengagement Theory the Activity Theory of old age argues that disengagement in old age occurs not by desire, but by the barriers to social engagement imposed by society. This theory has been faulted for not factoring in psychological <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> in old age as shown by reduced activity even when available. It has also been found that happiness in old age is not proportional to activity.|$|E

25|$|Puberty {{coincides with}} the {{beginning}} of estrous cycles. Estrous cycles are the recurring hormonal and physiological <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> within the bodies of most mammalian females that lead to ovulation {{and the development of a}} suitable environment for embryonic and fetal growth. The cow is considered polyestrous, which means that she will continue to undergo regular estrous cycles until death unless the cycle is interrupted by a pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|DSC {{is used in}} {{the study}} of liquid crystals. As some forms of matter go from solid to liquid they go through a third state, which {{displays}} properties of both phases. This anisotropic liquid is known as a liquid crystalline or mesomorphous state. Using DSC, it is possible to observe the small energy <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> as matter transitions from a solid to a liquid crystal and from a liquid crystal to an isotropic liquid.|$|E

25|$|Trauma {{occurs in}} {{approximately}} 5% of all pregnancies, {{and is the}} leading cause of maternal death. Additionally, pregnant women may experience placental abruption, pre-term labor, and uterine rupture. There are diagnostic issues during pregnancy; ionizing radiation has been shown to cause birth defects, although the doses used for typical exams generally are considered safe. Due to normal physiological <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> during pregnancy, shock may be more difficult to diagnose. Where the woman is more than 23 weeks pregnant, it is recommended that the fetus be monitored for at least four hours by cardiotocography.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} {{process for}} use in industrial settings has been developed known as enzymatic nixtamalization which uses protease enzymes to accelerate the <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> in traditional nixtamalization. In this process, corn or corn meal is first partially hydrated in hot water, so that enzymes can penetrate the grain, then soaked briefly (for approximately 30 minutes) at 50°–60°C in an alkaline solution containing protease enzymes. A secondary enzymatic digestion may follow to further dissolve the pericarp. The resulting nixtamal is ground {{with little or no}} washing or hulling.|$|E

25|$|Leptin, however, plays a {{different}} role in diet-induced obesity in rodents and humans. Because adipocytes produce leptin, leptin levels are elevated in the obese. However, hunger remains, and- when leptin levels drop due to weight loss- hunger increases. The drop of leptin is better {{viewed as a}} starvation signal than the rise of leptin as a satiety signal. However, elevated leptin in obesity is known as leptin resistance. The <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> in the hypothalamus to result in leptin resistance in obesity are currently the focus of obesity research.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} of consistent benefit of alternative therapies for menopausal symptoms despite their popularity. The effect of soy isoflavones on menopausal symptoms is promising for reduction of hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Evidence does not support a benefit from phytoestrogens such as coumestrol, femarelle, or the non-phytoestrogen black cohosh. There is {{no evidence}} to support the efficacy of acupuncture as a management for menopausal symptoms. As of 2011 there is no support for herbal or dietary supplements in the prevention or treatment of the mental <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> around menopause. A 2016 Cochrane review found not enough evidence to show a difference between Chinese herbal medicine and placebo for the vasomotor symptoms.|$|E

The opiate receptor was also examined, allowing observation of the pleasure stimuli. In the procedure both human and a rat had their receptors blocked with a certain drug. Once receptors were blocked, both the rat and the human were exposed to pleasurable food, but both were disinclined to eat the food.|$|E
