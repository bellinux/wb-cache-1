5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed lung) is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the <b>chest</b> <b>wall.</b> The lung cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. An easy to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the <b>chest</b> <b>wall.</b> Similarly, a scuba diver ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural space.|$|E
5|$|Pleurodesis is a {{procedure}} that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the <b>chest</b> <b>wall.</b> No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the healing process, the lung adheres to the <b>chest</b> <b>wall,</b> effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E
5|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} of the <b>chest</b> <b>wall</b> {{is commonly}} {{among the first}} signs to appear that barotrauma, damage caused by excessive pressure, has occurred, {{and it is an}} indication that the lung was subjected to significant barotrauma. Thus the phenomenon may occur in diving injuries.|$|E

25|$|Its {{effectiveness}} {{is limited to}} younger children in early- to mid-puberty because older individuals have less compliant (flexible) <b>chest</b> <b>walls.</b> One potential adverse interaction with other medical devices is possible inactivation of artificial pacemakers if present.|$|R
50|$|Specifically, {{percussion}} {{is performed}} with the middle finger striking the middle phalanx of the other middle finger of the other hand. The sides of the chest are compared. This is performed symmetrically on all lung fields, on the anterior and posterior <b>chest</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{physical}} processes behind pulmonary contusion are poorly understood. However, {{it is known}} that lung tissue can be crushed when the <b>chest</b> <b>wall</b> bends inward on impact. Three other possible mechanisms have been suggested: the inertial effect, the spalling effect, and the implosion effect.|$|E
5|$|Non-human animals may {{experience}} both spontaneous and traumatic pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax is, as in humans, classified as primary or secondary, while traumatic pneumothorax {{is divided into}} open and closed (with or without <b>chest</b> <b>wall</b> damage). The diagnosis may be apparent to the veterinary physician because the animal exhibits difficulty breathing in, or has shallow breathing. Pneumothoraces may arise from lung lesions (such as bullae) or from trauma to the <b>chest</b> <b>wall.</b> In horses, traumatic pneumothorax may involve both hemithoraces, as the mediastinum is incomplete {{and there is a}} direct connection between the two halves of the chest. Tension pneumothorax – the presence of which may be suspected due to rapidly deteriorating heart function, absent lung sounds throughout the thorax, and a barrel-shaped chest – is treated with an incision in the animal's chest to relieve the pressure, followed by insertion of a chest tube.|$|E
5|$|The {{thoracic}} cavity is the space inside the chest {{that contains the}} lungs, heart, and numerous major blood vessels. On {{each side of the}} cavity, a pleural membrane covers the surface of lung (visceral pleura) and also lines the inside of the <b>chest</b> <b>wall</b> (parietal pleura). Normally, the two layers are separated by a small amount of lubricating serous fluid. The lungs are fully inflated within the cavity because the pressure inside the airways is higher than the pressure inside the pleural space. Despite the low pressure in the pleural space, air does not enter it because there are no natural connections to an air-containing passage, and the pressure of gases in the bloodstream is too low for them to be forced into the pleural space. Therefore, a pneumothorax can only develop if air is allowed to enter, through damage to the <b>chest</b> <b>wall</b> or damage to the lung itself, or occasionally because microorganisms in the pleural space produce gas.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Attention {{coefficient}} and propagation {{speed of}} intercostal tissues were estimated from <b>chest</b> <b>walls</b> re-moved postmortem (pm) from 15 5. 32. 3 -day-old, 19 316 -day-old, and 15 613 -day-old crossbred pigs. These ultra-sonic propagation properties were determined from mea-surements through the intercostal tissues, {{from the surface}} of the skin to the parietal pleura. The <b>chest</b> <b>walls</b> were placed in a 0. 9 % sodium chloride solution, sealed in freezer bags, and stored at 15 C prior to measurements. When evaluated, chest-wall storage time ranged between 1 and 477 days pm. All <b>chest</b> <b>walls</b> were allowed to equilibrate to 22 C in a water bath prior to evaluation. There was an age de-pendency of the intercostal tissue propagation speed, with the speed increasing with increasing age. The attenuation coefficient of intercostal tissue was shown to be indepen-dent of the age of the pig at the discrete frequencies of 3. 1 and 6. 2 MHz. For pig intercostal tissues, the estimated at-tenuation coefficient over the 3. 1 – 9. 2 MHz frequency range was A = 194 f 090 where A is in decibels per centimeter (dB/cm) and f is the ultrasonic frequency in megahertz. In order to determine if there was an effect of storage time pm on estimates of attenuation coefficient, a second exper-iment was conducted. Five of the youngest pig <b>chest</b> <b>walls</b> measured on day 1 pm in the first experiment were stored at 4 C prior to the first evaluation then stored at 15 C before being measured again at 108 days pm. There was no difference in the estimated intercostal tissue attenuation co-efficient as a function of storage time pm. I...|$|R
50|$|Eumycetoma is {{a chronic}} granulomatous fungal disease of humans, {{affecting}} mainly the limbs, {{and sometimes the}} abdominal and <b>chest</b> <b>walls</b> or the head. Mycetoma pedis (mycetoma of the foot), {{the most common form}} of mycetoma, is known widely as the Madura foot. The infection is endemic in Africa, India and the Central and South Americas.|$|R
25|$|As a dome, the {{diaphragm}} has peripheral attachments to structures {{that make up}} the abdominal and <b>chest</b> <b>walls.</b> The muscle fibres from these attachments converge in a central tendon, which forms the crest of the dome. Its peripheral part consists of muscular fibers that take origin from the circumference of the inferior thoracic aperture and converge to be inserted into a central tendon.|$|R
5|$|Marsh {{and then}} Hatcher {{assumed that the}} animal was aquatic, because of the {{position}} of its nasal openings at the apex of the cranium. Similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. A 1951 study by Kenneth A. Kermack indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils {{when the rest of the}} body was submerged, as the water pressure on the <b>chest</b> <b>wall</b> would be too great. Since the 1970s, general consensus has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing on trees, ferns, and bushes.|$|E
5|$|The {{vascular}} (blood) {{system can}} be impacted by solid tumors. Between 15 and 25 percent of deep vein thrombosis is caused by cancer (often by a tumor compressing a vein), {{and it may be}} the first hint that cancer is present. It causes swelling and pain in the legs, especially the calf, and (rarely) in the arms. The superior vena cava (a large vein carrying circulating, de-oxygenated blood into the heart) may be compressed by a tumor, causing superior vena cava syndrome, which can cause <b>chest</b> <b>wall</b> pain among other symptoms.|$|E
5|$|A less {{invasive}} {{approach is}} thoracoscopy, {{usually in the}} form of a procedure called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The results from VATS-based pleural abrasion are slightly worse than those achieved using thoracotomy in the short term, but produce smaller scars in the skin. Compared to open thoracotomy, VATS offers a shorter in-hospital stays, less need for postoperative pain control, and a reduced risk of lung problems after surgery. VATS may also be used to achieve chemical pleurodesis; this involves insufflation of talc, which activates an inflammatory reaction that causes the lung to adhere to the <b>chest</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
50|$|Later in the examination, {{when the}} back is examined, {{the patient is}} usually asked to move the arms forward so that the scapulae {{are not in the}} way of {{examining}} the upper lung fields. These fields are intended to correlate with the lung lobes and are thus tested on the anterior and posterior <b>chest</b> <b>walls</b> (the front and back of the patient's thorax).|$|R
50|$|As a dome, the {{diaphragm}} has peripheral attachments to structures {{that make up}} the abdominal and <b>chest</b> <b>walls.</b> The muscle fibres from these attachments converge in a central tendon, which forms the crest of the dome.

5000|$|Because {{children}} have more flexible <b>chest</b> <b>walls</b> than adults do, their ribs {{are more likely}} to bend than to break; therefore the presence of rib fractures in children is evidence of a significant amount of force and may indicate severe thoracic injuries such as pulmonary contusion. [...] Rib fractures are also a sign of more serious injury in elderly people.|$|R
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space between the lung and the <b>chest</b> <b>wall.</b> Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases the amount of air in the chest increases when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. Unless reversed by effective treatment, it can result in death. Very rarely both lungs may be affected by a pneumothorax. It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to atelectasis.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord can produce analgesia. First, the leads are implanted, guided by fluoroscopy and feedback from the patient, and the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy. If pain is reduced by more than half, the therapy is deemed to be suitable. A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath {{the skin of the}} upper buttocks, <b>chest</b> <b>wall</b> or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they are attached to the snugly fitting generator. It seems to be more helpful with neuropathic and ischemic pain than nociceptive pain, but current evidence is too weak to recommend its use in the treatment of cancer pain.|$|E
5|$|Paralytic {{shellfish}} poisoning (PSP) {{is primarily}} {{caused by the}} consumption of bivalves that have accumulated toxins by feeding on toxic dinoflagellates, single-celled protists found naturally in the sea and inland waters. Saxitoxin is the most virulent of these. In mild cases, PSP causes tingling, numbness, sickness and diarrhoea. In more severe cases, {{the muscles of the}} <b>chest</b> <b>wall</b> may be affected leading to paralysis and even death. In 1937, researchers in California established the connection between blooms of these phytoplankton and PSP. The biotoxin remains potent even when the shellfish are well-cooked. In the United States, there is a regulatory limit of 80µg/g of saxitoxin equivalent in shellfish meat.|$|E

30|$|Methods: Before {{and at the}} end of 62 one-hour T-tube {{spontaneous}} breathing trials (SBT) {{performed in}} 43 patients, we assessed the LUS profile in the anterior regions of left and right <b>chest</b> <b>walls.</b> WIPO was diagnosed with LUS if, on at least one upper or lower part of both sides, the LUS profile moved from A (normal) to B (interstitial oedema) or from B to “B+”, where B+ consisted in at least a doubling of the B lines number.

This arrangement reduced the need of heterologous blood significantly from 18. 6 % (prior to the introduction of the method) to 4. 2 %...|$|R
5|$|The third {{mechanism}} {{occurs when}} the chest is compressed from front to back, causing it to widen from side to side. The lungs adhere to the <b>chest</b> <b>wall</b> because of the negative pressure {{between them and the}} pleural membranes lining the inside of the chest cavity; thus when the chest widens, they are pulled apart. This creates tension at the carina; the airway tears if this tensile force exceeds its elasticity. This mechanism may be the cause of injury when the chest is crushed. Most TBI are probably due to a combination of these three mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Traumatic {{pneumothorax}} {{most commonly}} {{occurs when the}} <b>chest</b> <b>wall</b> is pierced, such as when a stab wound or gunshot wound allows air to enter the pleural space, or because some other mechanical injury to the lung compromises {{the integrity of the}} involved structures. Traumatic pneumothoraces have been found to occur in up to half of all cases of chest trauma, with only rib fractures being more common in this group. The pneumothorax can be occult (not readily apparent) in half of these cases, but may enlarge - particularly if mechanical ventilation is required. They are also encountered in patients already receiving mechanical ventilation for some other reason.|$|E
5|$|No single {{method for}} {{confirming}} tracheal tube placement {{has been shown}} to be 100% reliable. Accordingly, the use of multiple methods for confirmation of correct tube placement is now widely considered to be the standard of care. Such methods include direct visualization as the tip of the tube passes through the glottis, or indirect visualization of the tracheal tube within the trachea using a device such as a bronchoscope. With a properly positioned tracheal tube, equal bilateral breath sounds will be heard upon listening to the chest with a stethoscope, and no sound upon listening to the area over the stomach. Equal bilateral rise and fall of the <b>chest</b> <b>wall</b> will be evident with ventilatory excursions. A small amount of water vapor will also be evident within the lumen of the tube with each exhalation and there will be no gastric contents in the tracheal tube at any time.|$|E
50|$|Subacute: A slower, {{less severe}} {{progression}} of the disease. Symptoms include recurrent fever, weight loss, an enlarged spleen (felt during a rectal examination), anemia, and swelling of the lower <b>chest,</b> abdominal <b>wall,</b> penile sheath, scrotum, and legs.|$|R
40|$|Low {{frequency}} {{current density}} imaging (LFCDI) using a magnetic resonance (MR) imager {{has been shown}} to accurately measure electrical current density inside a phantom. CDI measures the magnetic field generated by the current and converts it to current density (CD) by computing its curl. This makes CDI an ideal technique for studying the current flow inside the body during electrical therapies such as defibrillation where the current density in tissue is closely associated with the efficacy. Here we report simultaneous measurements of current density at all points within the pig torso during an electrical current application through defibrillation electrodes. We observed current flow over the <b>chest</b> <b>walls</b> in agreement with the current literature. However, complex and unexpected curren...|$|R

5|$|Chest x-ray is {{the initial}} imaging {{technique}} used to diagnose TBI. The film {{may not have}} any signs in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Indications of TBI seen on radiographs include deformity in the trachea or a defect in the tracheal wall. Radiography may also show cervical emphysema, air in the tissues of the neck. X-rays may also show accompanying injuries and signs such as fractures and subcutaneous emphysema. If subcutaneous emphysema occurs and the hyoid bone appears in an X-ray to be sitting unusually high in the throat, {{it may be an}} indication that the trachea has been severed. TBI is also suspected if an endotracheal tube appears in an X-ray to be out of place, or if its cuff appears to be more full than normal or to protrude through a tear in the airway. If a bronchus is torn all the way around, the lung may collapse outward toward the <b>chest</b> <b>wall</b> (rather than inward, as it usually does in pneumothorax) because it loses the attachment to the bronchus which normally holds it toward the center. In a person lying face-up, the lung collapses toward the diaphragm and the back. This sign, described in 1969, is called fallen lung sign and is pathognomonic of TBI (that is, it is diagnostic for TBI because it does not occur in other conditions); however it occurs only rarely. In as many as one in five cases, people with blunt trauma and TBI have no signs of the injury on chest X-ray. CT scanning detects over 90% of TBI resulting from blunt trauma, but neither X-ray nor CT are a replacement for bronchoscopy.|$|E
25|$|The <b>chest</b> <b>wall</b> is elastic, {{gradually}} stiffening over age. Non-surgical treatments {{have been}} developed that aim at gradually alleviating the pectus excavatum condition, making use of the elasticity of the <b>chest</b> <b>wall,</b> including the costal cartilages, in particular in young cases.|$|E
25|$|A {{standard}} echocardiogram is {{also known}} as a transthoracic echocardiogram, or cardiac ultrasound. In this case, the echocardiography transducer (or probe) is placed on the <b>chest</b> <b>wall</b> (or thorax) of the subject, and images are taken through the <b>chest</b> <b>wall.</b> This is a noninvasive, highly accurate, and quick assessment of the overall health of the heart.|$|E
25|$|In April 2009, hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbCD) was {{approved}} under compassionate {{use by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat Addison and Cassidy Hempel, identical twin girls suffering from Niemann–Pick type C disease. Medi-ports, similar to ports used to administer chemotherapy drugs, were surgically placed into the twins' <b>chest</b> <b>walls</b> and allow doctors to directly infuse HPbCD into their bloodstreams. Treatment with cyclodextrin {{has been shown to}} delay clinical disease onset, reduced intraneuronal storage and secondary markers of neurodegeneration, and significantly increased lifespan in both the Niemann–Pick type C mice and feline models. This is the second time in the United States that cyclodextrin alone has been administered in an attempt treat a fatal pediatric disease. In 1987, HPbCD was used in a medical case involving a boy suffering from severe hypervitaminosis A.|$|R
25|$|In women, {{the breasts}} overlay the pectoralis major muscles and usually extend from {{the level of}} the second rib to {{the level of the}} sixth rib in the front of the human rib cage; thus, the breasts cover much of the chest area and the <b>chest</b> <b>walls.</b> At the front of the chest, the breast tissue can extend from the {{clavicle}} (collarbone) to the middle of the sternum (breastbone). At the sides of the chest, the breast tissue can extend into the axilla (armpit), and can reach as far to the back as the latissimus dorsi muscle, extending from the lower back to the humerus bone (the longest bone of the upper arm). As a mammary gland, the breast is composed of differing layers of tissue, predominantly two types: adipose tissue; and glandular tissue, which affects the lactation functions of the breasts.|$|R
