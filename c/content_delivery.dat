First, a subjective evaluation experiment on image downloading is carried out to obtain the relationship between the waiting time and the utility. From the results, a function of the utility versus the waiting time is estimated. Then, this function is applied to the optimization of the priority control of an image delivery system. This system has two classes, and it is analyzed by computer simulation. The ratio of high priority packets to low priority packets is changed as a parameter, and the total utility of all users is maximized. The total utility of a two-class system is shown to be higher than that of a one-class system...|$|R
