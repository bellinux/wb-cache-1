We have used several different molecular approaches to evaluate diversity and relatedness in a selection of 34 <b>Chinese</b> <b>sorghums.</b> The results indicated that different DNA marker technologies for germplasm assessment yield comparable results, but that a relatively new technique termed inter-simple sequence repeat amplification (ISSR) was relatively rapid, reproducible, and inexpensive. Extensive diversity was observed within the <b>Chinese</b> <b>sorghums,</b> and all lines could be easily differentiated. Different lines collected from the same locality were found to exhibit particularly high levels of relatedness.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{technology}} {{was applied for}} polysaccharides extraction from the <b>Chinese</b> malted <b>sorghum</b> and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the effects of processing parameters on polysaccharides yields. Three independent variables were ultrasonic power (X 1), extraction time (X 2) and ratio of water to raw material (X 3), respectively. The statistical analysis indicated that three variables and the quadratic of X 1 and X 2 had significant effects on the yields and followed by the significant interaction effects between the variables of X 2 and X 3 (p< 0. 05). A mathematical model with high determination coefficient was gained and could be employed to optimize polysaccharides extraction. The optimal extraction conditions of polysaccharides were determined as follows: Ultrasonic power 600 W, extraction time 4 min, ratio of water to raw material 30 ml/g. Under these conditions, the experimental yield of polysaccharides was 17. 08 ± 0. 33 %, which was agreed closely with the predicted value 17. 06 %...|$|R
40|$|Forty <b>Chinese</b> <b>sorghum</b> [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] accessions {{maintained}} by the USDA-ARS, Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Unit, Griffin, Georgia were evaluated for multiple disease resistance. The level of sorghum downy mildew (SDM) infection with systemic infection and local lesion development for infected plants was low to very high. Accessions PI 511832, PI 563519, PI 563521, PI 563850, PI 610677 and P 610724 were the most resistant to sorghum downy mildew, whereas PI 610692 and PI 610720 were the most susceptible SDM. Thirty-three of the 40 sorghum accessions tested were susceptible to anthracnose. Four accessions, PI 430471, PI 563905, PI 563924 and PI 563960, were uniformly resistant to anthracnose. No sorghum accession exhibited resistance to both downy mildew and anthracnose. Because resistance was observed for anthracnose or downy mildew within the subset of the Chinese germplasm collection, additional screening of the collection could help identify accessions conferring resistance to multiple diseases to enhance sorghum improvemen...|$|E

40|$|Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV), a nonenveloped {{icosahedral}} virus with a genome of 10 double-stranded RNA segments, {{is a novel}} {{species in}} the genus Fijivirus (family Reoviridae) first recognized in 2008. Rice plants infected with this virus exhibit symptoms similar to those caused by Rice black-streaked dwarf virus. Since 2009, the virus has rapidly spread and caused serious rice losses in East and Southeast Asia. Significant {{progress has been made}} in recent years in understanding this disease, especially about the functions of the viral genes, rice–virus–insect interactions, and epidemiology and control measures. The virus can be efficiently transmitted by the white-backed planthopper (WBPH, Sogatella furcifera) in a persistent circulative propagative manner but cannot be transmitted by the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) and small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus). Rice, maize, <b>Chinese</b> <b>sorghum</b> (Coix lacryma-jobi) and other grass weeds can be infected via WBPH. However, only rice plays a major role in the virus infection cycle because of the vector&# 39;s preference. In Southeast Asia, WBPH is a long-distance migratory rice pest. The disease cycle can be described as follows: SRBSDV and its WBPH vector overwinter in warm tropical or sub-tropical areas; viruliferous WBPH adults carry the virus from south to north via long-distance migration in early spring, transmit the virus to rice seedlings in the newly colonized areas, and lay eggs on the infected seedlings; the next generation of WBPHs propagate on infected seedlings, become viruliferous, disperse, and cause new disease outbreaks. Several molecular and serological methods have been developed to detect SRBSDV in plant tissues and individual insects. Control measures based on protection from WBPH, including seedbed coverage, chemical seed treatments, and chemical spraying of seedlings, have proven effective in China...|$|E
40|$|The {{nutritional}} {{and chemical}} properties of three <b>Chinese</b> pollens, <b>sorghum</b> (Sorghum sp.), rapeseed (Brassica napus) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus), were studied. All three pollens were highly preferred, with sunflower pollen the highest, by young honey bees (Apis mellifera). Rapeseed pollen increased honey bee's longevity the greatest; however, sorghum and sunflower pollens also increased the longevity {{relative to the}} no-pollen group. All three pollens had high energy (about 5 kcal/g) and carbohydrate quantities (58 %). The protein, fat, and fiber levels were 27 %, 7 %, and 9 % in rapeseed pollen, 26 %, 5 %, and 13 % in sorghum pollen, and 15 %, 5 %, and 10 % in sunflower pollen. alpha-Tocopherol was high in sunflower pollen (61 μg/g), lower in rapeseed (33 μg/g) and sorghum pollen (15 μg/g).

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{comparative}} efficacy of different priming techniques on the germination {{and growth of}} <b>Chinese</b> sweet <b>sorghum,</b> a laboratory trial was conducted at Department of Agronomy, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan, during 2013. The experiment was laid in completely randomized design (CRD) and was replicated thrice. The treatments included control treatment (T 1) with no seed priming, seed priming with 1 % KNO 3 for 12 hours (T 2), seed priming with 1 % CaCl 2 for 12 hours (T 3), seed priming with 5 % moringa leaf extract for 12 hours (T 4), 10 % moringa leaf extract for 12 hours (T 5) and 15 % moringa leaf extract for 12 hours (T 6) and hydro-priming with distilled water for 12 hours (T 7). The results showed that seed priming with 5 % moringa leaf extract for 12 hours (T 4) was the best seed priming technique as it gave the maximum final germination percentage and the minimum time for 50 % germination as well as mean emergence time. This treatment also gave significantly {{the highest number of}} roots and leaves along with root and shoots length. Thus seed priming with 5 % moringa leaf extract has the potential to give the highest germination as well as seedling growth and development...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{diversity}} {{was characterized}} {{in a collection}} of 159 sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) landraces gathered from the colder region (primarily the northeastern region) of China. A set of 41 microsatellites or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers distributed throughout the 10 chromosomes of sorghum was utilized in the analysis. Majority (40 out of 41 SSRs, 98 %) of the SSR markers were polymorphic and highly informative with polymorphism information content (PIC) value ranging from 0. 05 to 0. 92. An estimation of genetic similarity coefficients (GSC, with values ranging from 0. 42 to 0. 96) revealed a range of variability in this collection of sorghum landraces. Eight clusters of accessions were identified at a cut off at 0. 50 GSC and these groupings were supported by the analysis of subpopulations using Structure. This study provides evidence that <b>Chinese</b> landraces of <b>sorghum</b> exhibit moderate genetic diversity and results from cluster analysis may well aid in identification of diverse accessions that can serve as parental lines for efficient utilization and application of these germplasm into sorghum breeding programs...|$|R
40|$|Cold {{temperatures}} in the early growing season are a major limitation to grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) production in temperate regions of the United States. Kaoliang sorghum landraces from China represent a possible source of genes for improvement of early-season cold tolerance in sorghum. A collection of 139 <b>Chinese</b> <b>sorghum</b> accessions was evaluated {{in the field and}} growth chamber for early-season traits under cold stress conditions. Field plantings were also evaluated for flowering time and mature plant height. Several accessions were identified with superior early-season performance in both the field and growth chamber. A range of bloom times and mature plant heights was observed in the collection, though most accessions bloomed relatively early and were very tall. The same <b>Chinese</b> <b>sorghum</b> accessions were also genotyped using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to characterize the genetic diversity present within the collection. Genetic distance analysis revealed an average pairwise similarity of 61. 7 %. Subsequent clustering analysis showed that accessions with good early-season cold tolerance were evenly scattered among the clusters. The results of both the field evaluation and genetic diversity analysis indicate the presence of significant variability within the kaoliang germplasm collection. To assess the inheritance of early-season cold tolerance, a recombinant inbred (RI) population was created by crossing ‘Shan Qui Red’ (SQR), a cold-tolerant kaoliang, with SRN 39, a cold-sensitive African caudatum. This population was utilized in several studies. To evaluate the field performance of kaoliang-derived sorghum under different planting conditions, SQR, SRN 39, 40 recombinant inbred lines, and their 42 hybrids with ‘Wheatland’ (a commercial seed parent) were planted in replicated field trials for three consecutive seasons under early and later plantings. Seedling performance was highly influenced by weather conditions. Early planting was generally associated with reduced emergence and seedling vigor, but hybrids tended to show better emergence and vigor than inbreds, as expected. Some correlations between the performance of inbred lines and of their hybrids with Wheatland were observed. In the early plantings of 2001 and 2003, final stand counts were significantly correlated between inbreds and hybrids. Days to half-bloom and mature plant height were both highly correlated between inbreds and hybrids, but yield was only moderately correlated in two of five plantings. Using this same RI population, quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was conducted to identify genetic markers linked to germination in the growth chamber, field emergence, and field seedling vigor under varying conditions. QTL were identified by single marker analysis, simple interval mapping (SIM), and composite interval mapping (CIM). Two QTL for germination were identified: one on linkage group SBI- 03 a, derived from SRN 39, was significant under cold and optimal temperatures. The other, on group SBI- 07 b, showed greater significance under cold temperatures and was contributed by SQR. A region of linkage group SBI- 01 a, derived from SQR, showed strong associations with seedling emergence and seedling vigor scores under early and late field plantings. A QTL for both early and late emergence was identified by CIM on group SBI- 02 which favored the SRN 39 allele. SIM identified a QTL for early vigor on SBI- 04 favoring the SQR genotype. Three SSR markers (Xtxp 43, Xtxp 51, and Xtxp 211), representing three major QTL for emergence and vigor in the field, were chosen for further testing in two segregating populations (Tx 2794 × SQR F 2, and Wheatland × SQR BC 1 F 2) to determine their effects in different genetic backgrounds. F 3 or BC 1 F 3 families from these populations carrying varying numbers of QTL markers were planted in replicated field trials in two successive growing seasons, and were tested for early-season performance and agronomic traits. Statistical analysis confirmed the effects of these markers in these new populations, thus validating their utility as tools for selection for early-season cold tolerance in sorghum. ...|$|E
40|$|Cold {{temperature}} {{occurring in}} the early growing season is a major limitation for sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) cultivation in the northern and central United States and other temperate regions. Chinese kaoliang sorghum landraces, known to have excellent seedling cold tolerance, were used {{as a source of}} genes to improve early-season cold tolerance in sorghum at Purdue University. In the last few years, work focused on introgressing two QTL were identified in a <b>Chinese</b> <b>sorghum</b> line Shan Qui Red (SQR) into five commercial grade inbred lines via marker assisted selection generating five pairs of isogenic lines with and without these markers. Selection for the cold tolerant alleles from the donor kaoliang parent was based on SSR (Simple Sequence Repeat) markers in the two QTL regions. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare performance differences between the original inbred and the new cold converted (CC) sorghum sister lines. The iso-lines were grouped into male and female parents and used to generate contrasting hybrids. Four cold converted inbred lines and four cold converted hybrids were evaluated in the growth chamber and field for early-season traits (seedling emergence, seedling vigor, and seedling biomass) under cold stress conditions. Flowering time, mature plant height and final grain yield were evaluated in the field trials. A germination test was conducted in the growth chamber to compare the converted and unconverted lines. Results showed that the effect of the QTL varied with inbred lines. K 1597 -CC 4 and Tx 2737 -CC showed improved cold tolerance over their unconverted counterparts in seedling emergence and germination under cold stress conditions in the field trial, growth chamber experiment and germination tests. Inbred line Wheatland, both converted and unconverted iso-lines showed good seedling cold tolerance with no significant difference between pairs. Hybrids generally showed superior performance to the lines in both seedling emergence and seedling vigor, due to the effect of heterosis. Though the R-line Tx 2737 showed relatively poor seedling emergence, remarkably, Tx 2737 hybrids showed the best seedling emergence and germination under cold stress conditions in this study. ...|$|E
