50|$|Such {{tools were}} used in large numbers in American {{telephone}} exchanges in {{the last third of}} the 20th century, usually with a bigger bit to handle 22 or 24 AWG wire rather than the smaller 28 or 30 AWG used in circuit boards and backplanes. The larger posts can be rewrapped hundreds of times. They persisted into the 21st century in distribution frames where insulation-displacement connectors had not taken over entirely. Larger, hand held, high speed electric wrap guns replaced soldering in the late 1960s for permanent wiring, when installing exchange equipment. In the middle 1980s they were gradually replaced by <b>connectorized</b> cables.|$|E
50|$|The {{infrared}} light used in telecommunications cannot be seen, {{so there is}} a potential laser safety hazard to technicians. The eye's natural defense against sudden exposure to bright light is the blink reflex, which is not triggered by infrared sources. In some cases the power levels are high enough to damage eyes, particularly when lenses or microscopes are used to inspect fibers that are emitting invisible {{infrared light}}. Inspection microscopes with optical safety filters are available to guard against this. More recently indirect viewing aids are used, which can comprise a camera mounted within a handheld device, which has an opening for the <b>connectorized</b> fiber and a USB output for connection to a display device such as a laptop. This makes the activity of looking for damage or dirt on the connector face much safer.|$|E
50|$|DS3 {{interconnect}} cables {{must be made}} with true 75-ohm coaxial cable and connectors. Cables or connectors which are 50 ohms or which significantly deviate from 75 ohms will result in signal reflections which will lower {{the performance of the}} connection, possibly to the point of not working. GR-139-CORE, Generic Requirements for Central Office Coaxial Cable, defines type 734 and 735 cables for this application. Due to losses, there are differing distance limitations for each type of cable. Type 734 has a larger center conductor and insulator for lower losses for a given distance. The BNC connectors are also very important as are the crimping and cable stripping tools used to install them. Trompeter, Cannon, Amphenol, Kings, and Canare make some of the true 75 ohm connectors known to work. RG-6 or even inexpensive RG-59 cable may work temporarily when properly <b>connectorized,</b> though it does not meet telephony technical standards. Type 735 26 AWG is used for interconnects up to 225 feet, and Type 734 20 AWG is used for interconnects up to 450 feet.|$|E
50|$|In 1949, ADC {{sold its}} {{audiometer}} product line and Ralph Allison {{left the company}} {{to form a new}} business in California. ADC diversified and focused its efforts in the area of transformers and filters for power lines, military electronics, telephone jacks and plugs. In 1961, ADC merged with Magnetic Controls Company, a manufacturer of power supplies and magnetic amplifiers with strong ties to the U.S. space program. The resulting company, ADC Magnetic Controls, had a decade of mixed success. Although transformer sales boomed during the 1960s, other new product initiatives failed to materialize. Perhaps the most significant product innovation during this period was the bantam jack, a miniaturized component that eventually became the standard for telephone circuit access and patching. Building on its growing sales of jacks and plugs in the early 1970s, ADC introduced prewired, <b>connectorized</b> jackfields, wired assemblies and test equipment for telephone operating companies. By 1974 the company was on solid ground, and by 1976, ADC had become the largest independent supplier of test boards in the United States.|$|E

40|$|There are {{a variety}} of mode-locked lasers {{suitable}} for telecommunications applications capable of generating picosecond-long pulses at high repetition rates. Although the direct generation of even shorter pulses at such high rates is possible it is generally considered far easier to compress the pulses of mode-locked lasers when sub-picosecond pulses are required.

40|$|A precise optical {{method was}} {{developed}} for measuring the concentricity of a longitudinal hole in a cylinder relative to the outer cylindrical surface. The work was done to provide improved accuracy over existing methods for measuring the concentricity ofan optical fiber relative to the outer ferrule diameter in an optical connector.

The technique involves the use of a laser interferometer to measure the passage of the ferrule into and out of a light beam whose attenuated energy is measured simultaneously to high precision. Combined measurements of the passage of a precisely fit pin or fiber in the ferrule hole through the light beam allow the concentricity of the fiber hole to be measured relative to the outer ferrule diameter. Repeatability measurements were made under different experimental arrangements, with both a collimated light beam and a slightly convergent light beam. Depending on the particular arrangement, the standard deviation for concentricity measurement in a given plane of the ferrule ranged from 2. 37 microinches to 4. 19 microinches...|$|E

A UWB transition from microstrip to double-sided parallel-strip line (DSPSL) soldered to a short (1. 14 mm) twin-line transmission line feeds the spiral. The currents on the feed travel in a direction approximately perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} currents on the spiral at the points where the feed passes the spiral in close proximity (0. 57 mm).

40|$|The Digital Beamforming Synthetic Aperture Radar (DBSAR) is an eight-channel {{phased array}} radar system that employs {{solid-state}} radar transceivers, a microstrip patch antenna, and a reconfigurable waveform generator and processor unit. The original DBSAR transceiver design utilizes <b>connectorized</b> electronic components {{that tend to}} be physically large and heavy. To achieve increased functionality in a smaller volume, PCB (printed circuit board) transceivers were designed to replace the large <b>connectorized</b> transceivers. One {{of the most challenging}} problems designing the transceivers in a PCB format was achieving proper performance in the calibration path. For a radar loop-back calibration path, a portion of the transmit signal is coupled out of the antenna feed and fed back into the receiver. This is achieved using passive components for stability and repeatability. Some signal also leaks through the receive path. As these two signal paths are correlated via an unpredictable phase, the leakage through the receive path during transmit must be 30 dB below the calibration path. For DBSAR s design, this requirement called for a 100 -dB isolation in the receiver path during transmit. A total of 16 solid-state L-band transceivers on a PCB format were designed. The transceivers include frequency conversion stages, T/R switching, and a calibration path capable of measuring the transmit power-receiver gain product during transmit for pulse-by-pulse calibration or matched filtering. In particular, this calibration path achieves 100 -dB isolation between the transmitted signal and the low-noise amplifier {{through the use of a}} switching network and a section of physical walls achieving attenuation of radiated leakage. The transceivers were designed in microstrip PCBs with lumped elements and individually packaged components for compactness. Each transceiver was designed on a single PCB with a custom enclosure providing interior walls and compartments to isolate transceiver subsystems from radiated interference. The enclosure also acts as a heat sink for the voltage regulators and power amplifiers inside the system. The PCB transceiver design produces transmit pulses of 2 W with an arbitrary duty cycle. Each transceiver is fed by an external 120 -MHz signal transmit and two 1, 140 -MHz local oscillator signals. The received signal is amplified and down-converted to 120 MHz and is fed to the data processor. The transceiver dimensions are approximately 3. 5 11. 5 0. 6 in. (9 29 1. 5 cm). The PCB transceiver design reduces the volume and weight of the DBSAR instrument while maintaining the functionality found in the original design. Both volume and weight are critical for airborne and flight remote sensing instrumentation...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} {{in the field of}} phased array feeds for radio astronomical reflector antennas, have opened a new frontier for array signal processing for radio astronomy observations. The goal is to replace single horn feeds with a phased array feed, so as to enable astronomers to cover more sky area in less time. The development of digital backend signal processing systems has been a major area of concentration for the development of science-ready phased array feeds for radio astronomers. This thesis focuses on the development of analog down-converter receivers and an FPGA-based digital backend for real-time data processing and analysis support for phased array feeds. Experiments were conducted with new receiver boards and both single-polarization and dual-polarization phased array feeds at the Arecibo Observatory, Puerto Rico and at the 20 -meter tele-scope at Green Bank, WV, and results were analyzed.

40|$|We {{present and}} analyze two {{pathways}} to produce commercial optical-fiber patch cords with stable long-term transmission in the ultraviolet (UV) at powers up to ∼ 200 mW, and typical bulk transmission between 66 - 75 %. Commercial fiber patch cords in the UV are {{of great interest}} across {{a wide variety of}} scientific applications ranging from biology to metrology, and the lack of availability has yet to be suitably addressed. We provide a guide to producing such solarization-resistant, hydrogen-passivated, polarization-maintaining, <b>connectorized</b> and jacketed optical fibers compatible with demanding scientific and industrial applications. Our presentation describes the fabrication and hydrogen loading procedure in detail and presents a high-pressure vessel design, calculations of required loading times, and information on patch cord handling and the mitigation of bending sensitivities. Transmission at 313 nm is measured over many months for cumulative energy on the fiber output of > 10 kJ with no demonstrable degradation due to UV solarization, in contrast to standard uncured fibers. Polarization sensitivity and stability are characterized yielding polarization extinction ratios between 15 dB and 25 dB at 313 nm, where we find patch cords become linearly polarizing. We observe that particle deposition at the fiber facet induced by high-intensity UV exposure can (reversibly) deteriorate patch cord performance and describe a technique for nitrogen purging of fiber collimators which mitigates this phenomenon.

40|$|Since {{the first}} <b>connectorized,</b> subsea fiber-optic data link was {{installed}} on the Phillips “Little Dotty ” field in January of 1997, the subsea oil industry has seen a number of projects, where optical fiber has been either critical to the program or has offered significant cost or performance advantages. These projects {{have been at the}} forefront of recent tieback technology development, and have been as diverse as the Norsk Hydro Troll Pilot subsea separation system and the Petrobras SBMS multiphase pump project, to new downhole gauges with remote, real time monitoring, such as the Shell ETAP program. Many of these projects have already been installed or are scheduled for phased installation over the next year or two. Optical fiber has been critical to these programs for a variety of reasons, ranging from data security for fiscal metering subsea through communication bandwidth and electrical noise immunity, to CAPEX reduction for Integrated Service Umbilicals for very deep-water installation (> 2000 m). Many of the goals for the tieback community can be achieved only with the aid of fiber-optic communication. Long step-out distances, or eventually tieback to shore, can benefit from fiber’s unrepeated communication distances of greater than 100 km. High-power, subsea pumps needed to pressure boost fluids over these step-out distances need electrical noise immunity, inherent in optical fiber. Umbilicals designed for long step-outs can be more cost efficient using optical fiber in high-density, small cable designs. While the control systems for complex subsea installations need increased bandwidth, which can easily be supplied by optical fiber, while wet-mate hybrid connectors allow modular installation...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{characterization}} {{and modeling}} of transistors {{are essential for}} the successful design of electroniccircuits. In many microwave circuit applications, transistors experience high-frequencyelectrical signals with large excursions. These signals drive the devices intoa nonlinear regime of operation. With {{the introduction of new}} materials in thetransistor fabrication process, additional effects, such as low-frequencydispersion, {{must be taken into account}} for a more complete investigation oftransistor characteristics. This work has aimed in the first place at characterizing transistors through nonlinear vector measurements. A time-domain based high-frequency large-signal network analyzer (LSNA) has beenextended towards the low-frequency range. When modulated excitations areapplied, the low-frequency part operates synchronously with the core RF LSNA. Otherwiseit can work like a stand-alone low-frequency LSNA. With this instrument, low-frequencydispersive effects under large-signal operation can be captured more accuratelythan before. Next, the calibrated large-signal voltage and current waveforms acquired by the combined low- andhigh-frequency LSNAs have been exploited to generate nonlinear transistormodels. Furthermore a waveform based nonlinear de-embedding procedure has beendeveloped. This technique can be adapted for improving waveform engineeringtechniques aimed at the design of high-frequency power amplifiers. Both themodeling and the de-embedding procedure are independent of the investigatedtransistor technology and therefore can be - in principle - adopted for anytype of active device.
