40|$|OBJECTIVE: Few {{diagnostic}} {{studies have}} reported rates of psychiatric comorbidity among <b>cocaine</b> <b>addicts</b> according to race. This study examines psychiatric comorbidity in African-American and white <b>cocaine</b> <b>addicts.</b> METHODS: Rates of psychiatric comorbidity were assessed in 263 <b>cocaine</b> <b>addicts</b> seeking substance abuse treatment. The sample included 163 non-Hispanic whites and 100 African Americans. Diagnoses were based on patient interviews using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Lifetime Version (SADS-L). The SADS-L was supplemented to include DSM-III-R criteria for substance abuse or dependence and other psychiatric diagnoses and DSM-III criteria for attention deficit disorder. RESULTS: Overall, 55. 7 percent of the <b>cocaine</b> <b>addicts</b> met Research Diagnostic Criteria for a current psychiatric diagnosis, and 73. 5 percent met criteria for a lifetime psychiatric diagnosis. Whites and African Americans {{did not differ significantly}} in overall psychiatric comorbidity. However, whites had significantly higher rates of life-time major depression, alcohol dependence, attention deficit disorder, and conduct disorder. African-American addicts, particularly women, were more likely to meet criteria for a current diagnosis of phobia. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric comorbidity is common among <b>cocaine</b> <b>addicts,</b> and the rates for specific disorders vary by race. Differences in current and lifetime rates should be noted. <b>Cocaine</b> <b>addicts</b> seeking treatment should be assessed for comorbid alcohol dependence and other psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, affective, and personality disorders...|$|R

40|$|The {{link between}} {{specific}} personality profiles {{and a single}} psychotropic drug of choice is still unclear and only partially explored. The present study compares three groups of male subjects: 85 patients manifesting heroin dependence (age: 30. 07 +/- 2. 78), 60 patients manifesting cocaine dependence (age: 31. 96 +/- 3. 1), and 50 healthy subjects from a random population sample (age: 33. 25 +/- 1. 45). The patients {{included in the study}} showed a long-lasting history of dependence on heroin or cocaine, respectively, 5. 2 +/- 2. 5 years, 4. 6 +/- 2. 9 years, and were stabilized in treatment, and abstinent, at least 4 weeks {{at the time of the}} diagnostic assessment. Heroin addicts (52. 90 %) were on methadone maintenance treatment. <b>Cocaine</b> <b>addicts</b> (11. 60 %) were treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Personality traits were measured by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI- 2) and Cloninger's Three-dimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ). Character and quantification of aggressiveness were measured by the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI). Heroin-dependent patients (group A) scored significantly higher on hysteria, masculine-feminine and social introversion subscales of the MMPI, and significantly lower on the harm avoidance (HA) subscale of the TPQ than <b>cocaine</b> <b>addicts.</b> In contrast, scores on the MMPI for hypochondria, psychopathic deviance, and paranoia dimensions were more elevated in <b>cocaine</b> <b>addicts</b> than in heroin-dependent patients. <b>Cocaine</b> <b>addicts</b> scored higher than heroin addicts on the "direct" aggressiveness subscale and on the BDHI total score. <b>Cocaine</b> <b>addicts</b> did not differ from healthy controls on harm avoidance (behavioral control). Although <b>cocaine</b> <b>addicts</b> showed more consistent psychopathic deviance and overt aggressiveness than heroin addicts, higher harm avoidance (behavioral control), hypochondria (or worry about their health), and social extroversion may reduce their proneness to overt antisocial behavior and allow relatively higher levels of social integration.

METHODS: Eighty-five consecutive subjects with a history of cocaine or opiate use disorders were recruited, evaluated and compared with 100 controls. The cocaine and heroin abusers were assessed with a 10 -cm Visual Analogue Scale, the Symptom Check List- 90 Revised, the Brown-Goodwin Scale, and the Barrat Impulsiveness Scale. RESULTS: Magnesium levels were higher in the cocaine group compared to the opiate group and control. Male subjects had lower magnesium levels than the females of all three groups. Scores of impulsiveness, aggressiveness, craving and psychiatric symptomatology were not significantly different between the opiate and <b>cocaine</b> <b>addicts.</b> DISCUSSION: This is the first study evaluating the magnesium level in <b>cocaine</b> <b>addicts.</b> <b>Cocaine</b> <b>addicts</b> showed higher total plasma magnesium levels than opiate addicts and normal controls, even though they remained in the normal range.

40|$|Objective: In this Master Thesis, we {{employed}} auditory evoked {{responses to}} iden-tify features {{from the time}} domain signals, Granger Causality matrixes and graph theory that provide maximum separation among schizophrenic patients, cocaine ad-dicts and normal controls. Methods: We analyzed data from 12 schizophrenia, 12 <b>cocaine</b> <b>addicts</b> and 12 normal control subjects. Responses were obtained in a paired-stimulus paradigm, in which auditory stimulus S 1 is followed by an identical S 2. Amplitude and latency of the N 100 component were measured from the averaged evoked potential, Granger Causality matrixes were computed and a graph was constructed from there. Ampli-tude, latency, Granger Causality values {{and a group of}} characteristics form the graph were used as features to cluster responses in three groups. Several methods were used for clustering, while their performance was quantified in a 10 -fold cross validation approach. Results: We found that the most important features come from Granger Causality matrix values, amplitude and latency coming from the average evoked responses ap-pear as insignificant features for the clustering. Influence of electrode C 3 to Pz appear as the most significant feature, separating schizophrenic patients from normal con-trols and <b>cocaine</b> <b>addicts</b> with a 100 % accuracy. In order to separate <b>cocaine</b> <b>addicts</b> from normal controls at least 31 features coming from Granger Causality matrixes were needed. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that Granger Causality values can accu-rately separate schizophrenia patients, <b>cocaine</b> <b>addicts</b> and normal controls and sug-gest that the Pz-C 3 region plays a significant role in information processing in human brain. i Significance: The proposed technique may have a significant impact as a clinical tool in the quest for identifying physiological markers of schizophrenia. i...|$|R

However, studies vary substantially with respect to methods and timeframes. Studies on German patient groups are scarce. Methods: Data on psychiatric and somatic comorbidity, substance addiction history, present intake patterns and socio-demography were obtained from 43 female (n= 11) and male (n= 32) heroin and <b>cocaine</b> <b>addicts</b> in acute inpatient de-toxification treatment or specified long-term treatment. A European Addiction-Severity-Index (EuropASI) based centre questionnaire and the Mini-DIPS were applied. Results: Treatment {{groups did not differ}} in psychiatric comorbidity.

40|$|By {{performing}} identical {{studies in}} humans and rats, {{we attempted to}} distinguish vulnerability factors for addiction from neurobiological effects of chronic drug exposure. We focused on the GABAergic system within the hippocampus, a brain region that is a constituent of the memory/conditioning neuronal circuitry of addiction that {{is considered to be}} important in drug reinforcement behaviors in animals and craving and relapse in humans. Using RNA-Seq we quantified mRNA transcripts in postmortem total hippocampus from alcoholics, <b>cocaine</b> <b>addicts</b> and controls and also from alcohol-naïve, alcohol preferring (P) and non-preferring (NP) rats selectively bred for extremes of alcohol-seeking behavior that also show a general addictive tendency. A pathway-targeted analysis of 25 GABAergic genes encoding proteins implicated in GABA synthesis, metabolism, synaptic transmission and re-uptake was undertaken. Directionally consistent and biologically plausible overlapping and specific changes were detected: 14 / 25 of the human genes and 12 / 25 of the rat genes showed nominally significant differences in gene expression (global p values: 9 × 10 ⁻¹⁴, 7 × 10 ⁻¹¹ respectively). Principal FDR-corrected findings were that GABBR 1 was down-regulated in alcoholics, <b>cocaine</b> <b>addicts</b> and P rats with congruent findings in NSF, implicated in GABAB signaling efficacy, potentially resulting in increased synaptic GABA. GABRG 2, encoding the gamma 2 subunit required for postsynaptic clustering of GABAA receptors together with GPHN, encoding the associated scaffolding protein gephryin, were both down-regulated in alcoholics and <b>cocaine</b> <b>addicts</b> but were both up-regulated in P rats. There were also expression changes specific to <b>cocaine</b> <b>addicts</b> (GAD 1, GAD 2), alcoholics (GABRA 2) and P rats (ABAT, GABRG 3). Our study confirms the involvement of the GABAergic system in alcoholism but also reveals a hippocampal GABA input in cocaine addiction.
