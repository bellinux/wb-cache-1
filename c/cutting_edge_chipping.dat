By preparing the cutting edge the tool performance can be improved due to the reduction of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> <b>chipping</b> {{and the creation of a}} defined stable edge rounding.

Unexpected chipping will occur on the minor cutting edge, when as insert that has proper chip breaking performance is under optimum cutting condition. Then, the effect of chip breakers on the wear and chipping of inserts have been experimentaly investigated. The progress of crater wear is studied in details with the contour observation of five different chip breakers. The main results obtained are as follow; (1) The chip breaker patterns of tool face affect feed force and thrust force. In the case of the grooved chip breaker, the thrust force is larger than the obstruction type breaker. The chip breaker patterns do not affect the side flow angle if the cutting conditions are the same. (2) The forms of crater wear minor <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> <b>chipping</b> are significant influenced with the chip breaker patterns. If the projection of chip breakers is properly worn away with the progress of cutting time, the center of crater of the tool face moves away from the major and the minor cutting edges. The chipping of the minor cutting edge is easy to appear with a decrement in the wear of chip breaker projection...|$|E
40|$|Machinability of Aermet 100, an {{ultrahigh}} strength alloy {{developed for}} Navy by Carpenter Technology {{as a candidate}} material for aircraft landing gear application, was studied by performing single-point turning tests. Coated and uncoated carbides, ceramic, and cermet cutting tool inserts of a square geometry (SNG 432 type) were used. Round stock workpieces were tested in the as - received, unaged condition and without using any cutting fluid. The turning tests for each tool material were conducted by (i) first establishing the cutting conditions {{that would allow the}} continued generation of broken chips during a given cutting test, (ii) measuring intermittently the flank wear as a function of cutting time under such established cutting conditions for discontinuous broken chips, and (iii) determining the tool life using the criteria specified in the ISO Standard 3685 : 1993 (E). Cutting tools except some uncoated carbide and ceramic were used with a mechanical chip breaker to induce chip breakage and avoid the generation of long continuous chips. The results obtained include the optimal cutting conditions for discontinuous chips, tool wear - cutting time curves, and records of tool life and tool failure mode for each tool material. From the measured tool life and cutting conditions, the amount of material removed by each cutting material was calculated. Coated carbide with CVD tri-phase coating showed the longest tool life that exceeded the twelve minute criterion and removed the highest amount of material per tool.

To simulate the production trimming process under a laboratory accelerated fatigue condition, a trim die simulator and testing technique have been developed. In this test 12 ̆ 2 cubic die samples were used that offers total 12 cutting edges of 6 different material grain orientations in shearing, and with adjustable die clearance. A non-contact metal removal volume measurement was developed to quantify the degree of fatigue damage during cyclic loading, and the metallurgical replica method was used at different number of cycles from the interrupted testing for obtaining micro-damage information. The damage rate {{at the cutting edge}} was obtained as a function of trimming process variables, including the die material grain orientations, the loading frequency, and the amplitude of fatigue loading. The microstructure, micro-damage and fractured surfaces were examined with optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The results show that there exist two types of distinct damage processes: the continuous contact deformation process that occurs at a low fatigue load, and the discontinuous <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> <b>chipping</b> process at a high fatigue loading with significantly higher material removal rate. The chipping involves crack initiation and propagation within the carbide phase surrounding the pro-eutectic grains, leading to grain broken and fall apart. An empirical trim die damage rate model in Paris law form is obtained from experimental data regression, and can be used for tool life prediction. The grain orientation relative to the cutting direction is found to have remarkable effect on trimming damage rate...|$|E
40|$|Basic quality {{requirements}} in machining of CFRP components, besides the geometric precision, are thermally undamaged and delamination-free cutting surfaces and edges. Machining of large CFRP structures implies {{a high risk}} of component recovery cost and time, since machining operations are late within the production process chain of those components. Moreover, machinery for processing large CFRP structures is very expensive. These reasons substantiate the need for online-monitored reliable high-productivity CFRP machining capable of preventing rework and waste. Existing process monitoring and control systems developed for metal machining are not suitable for CFRP because the material-specific machinability in terms of tool wear, forces and surface quality call for different detection mechanisms. Accordingly, this study is dedicated to experimental investigations of CFRP machining in order to determine suitable signals and sensors for online monitoring of the relevant tool wear and quality parameters. As the edge trimming of large CFRP components is most difficult to control up to now, the study focuses on this operation. Promising first results with regard to preventive monitoring of tool wear and surface temperature were obtained by force and acceleration evaluation. Experimental studies have been performed in CFRP machining in order to establish a basis for online monitoring with focus on edge trimming. The findings can be summarized as follows: - According to the anisotropy of CFRP the cutting force, the surface temperature and the main spindle power as well as the feed drive torque exhibit a periodic variation - Continuously progressing tool wear with feed travel and local <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> <b>chipping</b> are related to an increase of the feed or active force in milling - The amplitudes of the feed force and of the acceleration at the spindle head, which correspond to the spindle speed and its first two harmonic multiples, indicate a clear difference between new and worn cutters - The maximum surface temperature easily exceeds the temperature limit of epoxy resins and is related to the active force - Automated online detection of delamination remains a challenge...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{transient}} phenomenon of chip generations and {{behavior in the}} gear hobbing process are investigated by using a high-speed video camera. The chip behavior generated in gear finish hobbing process is very complicated and one can not identify each <b>chip</b> from specified <b>cutting</b> <b>edges.</b> The authors have built up a new simulation method of the hobbing process using a flying tool and a special-shaped workpiece, which consists of one tooth space. Visual evidences of the chip interference on the rake face and some conditions of contact between generated chips and the work surface were visually obtained. In the case of dry cutting conditon with a high-speed steel (HSS) flytool without coating on the rake face, the flytool cuts the workpiece frequently with the stuck chip generated in the previous revolution on the rake face. The newly generated chip pushes out the previous stuck chip, which flies away eventually. The chip flow on the rake face interferes strongly {{at the corner of}} the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> when both top and side <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> produce different <b>chips</b> at the same time, and the chips flow out in changing the shape.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{placement}} of self-tapping implants {{is associated with}} microfractures {{and the formation of}} bone chips along the cutting flutes. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of different <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> angles on <b>chip</b> formation during the machining of trabecular and cortical bone using instruments with a rough titanium surface. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mandibular cortical and trabecular bone specimens were obtained from freshly slaughtered domestic pigs. A predefined thrust force was applied to the specimens. Four specially designed cutting instruments that simulated dental implants and had a rough titanium surface were allowed to complete one full revolution at <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> angles of 55, 65, 75, and 85 degrees, respectively. Torque and thrust were measured during the cutting process. Bone chips were measured and weighed under a microscope. RESULTS: Different <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> angles did not lead to significant differences in torque. The lowest torque values were measured when the <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> were positioned at 65 degrees in trabecular bone and at 85 degrees in cortical bone. Bone chips were significantly larger and heavier at angles of 55 and 65 degrees than at angles of 75 and 85 degrees in trabecular bone. CONCLUSION: Instruments with a rough titanium surface show considerable angle-dependent differences in chip formation. In addition to bone density, the angle of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> should be taken into consideration during the {{placement of}} dental implants. Good results were obtained when the <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> were positioned at an angle of 65 degrees. This angle can have positive effects on osseointegration...|$|R
50|$|The {{most notable}} {{advantage}} of the scary sharp system is speed and cost. Anyone with access to sandpaper and a reasonably flat surface can sharpen any cutting tool, often with good results. Unlike traditional stones, no maintenance {{is required for the}} scary-sharp set-up, since the sharpening surface does not form a hollow with repeated, uneven usage. A hollowed surface is undesirable in most sharpening situations, an example being the flat surface required in the back (as opposed to the beveled surface) of most woodworking plane irons. Compared to stones, sandpaper is lower in cost as well. A fresh sheet of sandpaper often cuts significantly faster than a bench sharpening stone.

Oliaei and Karpat [16] investigated the influence of machining parameters on the surface roughness of stainless steel machining. Bissacco et al.

Sun et al. [18] studied the relationship among the surface roughness, the feed per tooth, as well as the cutter geometry. Li et al.

Based on this model, a surface roughness model with tool wear effect is developed by taking the material removal volume and cutting velocity into account and is experimentally validated. Weule et al.

5000|$|Under normal usage, swarf {{is carried}} {{up and away}} from the tip of the drill bit by the fluting of the drill bit. The <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> produce more <b>chips</b> which {{continue}} the movement of the chips outwards from the hole. This is successful until the chips pack too tightly, either because of deeper than normal holes or insufficient backing off (removing the drill slightly or totally from the hole while drilling). Cutting fluid is sometimes used to ease this problem and to prolong the tool's life by cooling and lubricating the tip and chip flow. Coolant may be introduced via holes through the drill shank, which is common when using a gun drill. When cutting aluminum in particular, cutting fluid helps ensure a smooth and accurate hole while preventing the metal from grabbing the drill bit in the process of drilling the hole. When cutting brass, and other soft metals that can grab the drill bit and causes [...] "chatter", a face of approx. 1-2 millimeters can be ground on the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> to create an obtuse angle of 91 to 93 degrees. This prevents [...] "chatter" [...] during which the drill tears rather than cuts the metal. However, with that shape of bit <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> the drill is pushing the metal away, rather than grabbing the metal. This creates high friction and very hot swarf.For heavy feeds and comparatively deep holes oil-hole drills are used in the drill bit, with a lubricant pumped to the drill head through a small hole in the bit and flowing out along the fluting. A conventional drill press arrangement can be used in oil-hole drilling, but it is more commonly seen in automatic drilling machinery in which it is the workpiece that rotates rather than the drill bit.|$|R

40|$|Metal cutting {{is one of}} {{the most}} common metal shaping processes.

Furthermore, dissipative plastic and friction work generate high local temperatures. These phenomena together with numerical complications make modeling of metal cutting difficult. Material models, which are crucial in metal cutting simulations, are usually calibrated based on data from material testing. Nevertheless, the magnitude of strain and strain rate involved in metal cutting are several orders higher than those generated from conventional material testing.

Parameters of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> have a great influence on tool life and therefore it is important to measure them correctly. Primarily the radius of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> and the K factor is usually monitored. This paper deals with measuring parameters on the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> such as radius of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> K factor and roughness of the surface, chipping, and their evaluation when machining special alloy Inconel 718 which is used mainly in the aerospace industry. Other measuring methods for tool life will be presented...|$|R
