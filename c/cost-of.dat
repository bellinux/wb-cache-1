25|$|Since the 1950s, {{there has}} been a renewed {{interest}} in the collection of bookplates and in many ways a reorientation of this interest. There are still substantial numbers of collectors for whom the study of bookplates spanning 500 years is a fascinating source of historical, artistic and socio-cultural interest. They have however been joined by a now dominant group of new collectors whose interest is more than anything the constitution—at quite reasonable <b>cost—of</b> a miniature, personalized art-print collection. In this miniature art museum, they gather together the works of their favorite artists. They commission numbered and signed editions of bookplates to their name which are never pasted into books but only serve for exchange purposes.|$|E
50|$|Employees {{decide whether}} to work for piece rate pay if the {{relative}} earnings are high, and if other physical and psychological conditions are favorable. Some of these might be job stress, physicality, risks, degree of supervision and ability to work with peers or family members. Employees may also {{be more or less}} welcoming to performance pay depending on the leverage and risk. Leverage was defined as ratio of variable pay to base pay, and risk is the probability the employee will see increased benefits with effort. Workers tended to be suspicious of pay packages that were too heavy on variable pay and were concerned it might be a concession to remove <b>cost-of</b> living wage adjustments or to secure wage rollbacks.|$|E

40|$|It is {{a robust}} result {{that the average}} {{government}} (ruling a normal election period) in an established democracy loses about 2 ¬% of the vote. Three explanations exist: (i) The coalition-of-minorities theory. (ii) The median-gap theory. (iii) The grievance-asymmetry theory. These theories can all be calibrated to explain the fact. While (i) is difficult to justify, both (ii) and (iii) are integrated into other theories: (ii) is integrated into the "median-voter-complex" that rules out the existence of partisan cycles. (iii) is integrated into the "loss-aversion-complex" that via the grievance asymmetry provides a "deep-parameter" explanation of the <b>cost-of</b> ruling. It {{is also an important}} explanation for the partisan cycle model. We demonstrate that the two complexes are alternatives and argue that the loss-aversion-complex is more powerful.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a parsimonious model relating a firm’s price per share to, (i), next year expected {{earnings per share}} (eps), (ii), short term growth (FY- 2 vs. FY. 1) in eps, (iii), long-term (asymptotic) growth in eps, and, (iv), <b>cost-of</b> equity capital. The model assumes that {{the present value of}} dividends per share (dps) determines price, but it does not restrict how the dps-sequence is expected to evolve. All of these aspects of the model contrast sharply with the standard textbook approach, which equates the growth rates of expected dps and eps and fixes the growth rate and the payout rate. Though the constant growth model arises as a peculiar special case, the analysis in this paper rests on more general principles, including dividend policy irrelevancy. In addition to the valuation formula, a key result shows how one expresses cost-of-capital as a function of next-year expected eps and the two measures of growth in expected eps. This expression generalizes the text-book equation in which cost-of-capital equals dps-yield plus the growth in expected eps. 2 I...|$|E
30|$|This study {{addressed}} the nutritional and {{economic benefits of}} using a multi-stage LP optimization model in broiler feed formulation. The model provides information to feed producers and traders to determine potential switch points between commodities based on the price spread level. There are two primary limitations of the approach presented in this paper. First, the constraints are linear, thereby forcing corner solutions and discrete jumps between feed inputs. This may, however, be a realistic interpretation {{of the behavior of}} firms when considering contracting and transportation costs. Second, this model only examines the cost of inputs in feed mix and dietary requirements, while profit-maximizing behavior likely includes additional objectives and constraints. However, by examining the dietary feed commodity switch between months, we demonstrate variations in feeding strategies and opportunities to minimize feed <b>cost—of</b> primary significance in the livestock production profit function—over a given time period. Our model is built on an open source environment and can be broadly implemented by decision-makers to explore and test further modeling scenarios which suit the production objectives. Furthermore, if feed price forecasts are available, the model can also be automated to predict the least cost dietary dynamics and price spread.|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} {{economic model}} of bilateral precaution concludes that (in {{the absence of}} uncertainty, misperception, or error) all negligence-based liability rules induce socially optimal behavior by both injurers and victims. This paper generalizes the standard model to consider situations in which one party’s precaution affects not only expected accident loss, but also directly affects the other party’s effort—or <b>cost—of</b> taking precaution. If the injurer’s care affects the victim’s precaution costs (but not vice versa), most of the standard results continue to hold (except for strict liability with a defense of contributory negligence). If the victim’s precaution affects the injurer’s costs of care (but not vice versa), only strict liability with a defense of contributory negligence leads to the social optimum, while the other negligence-based rules lead to suboptimal outcomes. In the general case (where each party’s costs depend on both parties’ levels of precaution), none of the standard liability rules induce socially optimal behavior in both parties. The paper’s other main result concerns the possibility of self-interested, negligent behavior in equilibrium. Under negligence with a defense of contributory negligence, the only equilibrium is in the mixed strategies of both injurer and victim. This involves the parties choosing (with strictly positive probability) to behave negligently, and {{gives rise to the}} possibility of successful litigation in equilibrium, even though there is no uncertainty, misperception, or error. The paper concludes by considering the implications of these results for the design of liability rules. law and economics, and tort law...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{trials for}} {{preventative}} therapies {{are complex and}} costly endeavors focused on individuals likely to develop disease {{in a short time}} frame, randomizing them to treatment groups, and following them over time. In such trials, statistical power is governed by the rate of disease events in each group and cost is determined by randomization, treatment, and follow-up. Strategies that increase the rate of disease events by enrolling individuals with high risk of disease can significantly reduce study size, duration, and cost. Comprehensive study of common, complex diseases has resulted in a growing list of robustly associated genetic markers. Here, we evaluate the utility—in terms of trial size, duration, and <b>cost—of</b> enriching prevention trial samples by combining clinical information with genetic risk scores to identify individuals at greater risk of disease. We also describe a framework for utilizing genetic risk scores in these trials and evaluating the associated cost and time savings. With type 1 diabetes (T 1 D), type 2 diabetes (T 2 D), myocardial infarction (MI), and advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) as examples, we illustrate the potential and limitations of using genetic data for prevention trial design. We illustrate settings where incorporating genetic information could reduce trial cost or duration considerably, as well as settings where potential savings are negligible. Results are strongly dependent on the genetic architecture of the disease, but we also show that these benefits should increase as the list of robustly associated markers for each disease grows and as large samples of genotyped individuals become available...|$|E
40|$|A {{new device}} that {{produces}} and collects multiple electrons per photon could yield inexpensive, high-efficiency photovoltaics. A new device developed through {{research at the}} National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) reduces conventional losses in photovoltaic (PV) solar cells, potentially increasing the power conversion efficiency-but not the <b>cost-of</b> the solar cells. Solar cells convert optical energy from the sun into usable electricity; however, almost 50 % of the incident energy is lost as heat with present-day technologies. High-efficiency, multi-junction cells reduce this heat loss, but their cost is significantly higher. NREL's new device uses excess energy in solar photons to create extra charges rather than heat. This was achieved using 5 -nanometer-diameter quantum dots of lead selenide (PbSe) tightly packed into a film. The researchers chemically treated the film, and then fabricated a device that yielded an external quantum efficiency (number of electrons produced per incident photon) exceeding 100 %, a value beyond that of all current solar cells for any incident photon. Quantum dots are known to efficiently generate multiple excitons (a bound electron-hole pair) per absorbed high-energy photon, and this device definitively demonstrates the collection of multiple electrons per photon in a PV cell. The internal quantum efficiency corrects for photons that are not absorbed in the photoactive layer and shows that the PbSe film generates 30 % to 40 % more electrons in the high-energy spectral region than is possible with a conventional solar cell. While the unoptimized overall power conversion efficiency is still low (less than 5 %), the results {{have important implications for}} PV because such high quantum efficiency can lead to more electrical current produced than possible using present technologies. Furthermore, this fabrication is also amenable to inexpensive, high-throughput roll-to-roll manufacturing...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The extent to which any organisation dedicates its finite resources towards employee health and well-being issues is driven by some combination of ethical, legal and economic factors. This thesis is concerned with demonstrating the economic value of investments in employee health and well-being, focusing on how economic information is and could be generated and how organisations process this information in their decision-making regarding employee health and well-being issues. The thesis explores the notion that better, more appropriate economic information and more rigorous economic evaluation methodologies are important in creating incentives for organisations to invest in and better manage {{the health and well-being}} of their employees. A series of studies are presented: a review of the existing literature reporting <b>cost-of</b> illness and cost-effectiveness type studies; a study exploring current practice using a focus group followed by a series of individual interviews with key occupational health professionals in the UK; a study reporting a survey of specialist and generalist managers' attitudes, perceptions, information needs and experience of employee health and wellbeing 'business cases'; economic evaluation methods and their application to the occupational health setting are reviewed. These studies served to directly inform the design and development of an economic framework approach using employee self-report data to construct empirical case studies to demonstrate the correlation between employer costs and employee health and well-being metrics. These studies provide new information on the relative marginal effects of cost to an organisation of changes in different employee health and well-being measures. This knowledge could aid resource allocation decisions by providing estimates of the value to an organisation of effects that could be delivered by a diverse range of employee health and well-being interventions or policies. The separation of this economic information about the costs of employee health and well-being issues from economic information about specific interventions is likely to be key in creating incentives for organisations to invest in employee health and well-being...|$|E

Methods: A one-year (2002) observational prevalence, <b>cost-of</b> illness study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis from the societal perspective was performed in a hospital-based health management organization population. Direct medical costs were obtained using administrative databases. Direct nonmedical and indirect costs were obtained from a semistructured questionnaire. Indirect costs included work absenteeism, permanent work disability, and housework lost for housewives, using the human capital approach. Costs are expressed in 2002 US dollars per patient per year. Results: A total of 165 patients (84 % females), of mean age 61 &plusmn; 15 years and with a mean disease duration of 8. 5 &plusmn; 8. 3 years were included. Mean total direct medical costs were US$ 1862 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 828 &ndash; 2899). Mean direct nonmedical costs were US$ 222 (95 % CI 149 &ndash; 294). Mean indirect costs were US$ 1008 (95 % CI 606 &ndash; 1412). The annual mean total cost was US$ 3093 without biologics. Hospitalizations represented 73 % of total direct medical costs while drugs and outpatient procedures represented 16 % and 8 % of total direct medical costs, respectively. Sixty {{percent of the total}} costs were related to direct medical costs, while indirect costs represented 33 % of total costs. Conclusion: In our population, annual mean total costs in the prebiologic therapy era were mainly driven by direct medical costs. Even without the use of biologic agents, rheumatoid arthritis represents an important burden for society in developing countries.

40|$|We {{examine the}} trade credit {{linkages}} among firms within {{a supply chain}} to reckon the effect of such linkages on the propagation of liquidity shocks from downstream to upstream firms. We choose a sample appropriate for this task, consisting of a large data set of Italian firms from the textile industry, a well known example of a comprehensive manufacturing cluster featuring {{a large number of}} small and specialized firms at each level of the supply chain. The results of the analysis indicate that the level of trade credit that firms provide to their suppliers is positively related to the level of trade credit granted to their clients: when the level of trade credit granted to clients divided by sales goes up by 1, the level of trade credit provided to suppliers divided by <b>cost-of</b> goods-sold goes up by an amount that varies between 0, 22 and 0, 52. Since all firms along the chain are linked by trade credit relationships, an increase in the level of trade credit granted by wholesalers generates a liquidity cascade throughout the chain. We designate the overall increase in the level of trade credit among all firms in the chain {{as a result of a}} unitary impulse in the level of trade credit granted by wholesalers as the multiplier effect of trade credit for the industry chain. We estimate such multiplier to vary between 1. 28 and 2. 04. We also investigate the effect of final demand on the level of trade credit sourced by firms at various levels of the chain and, in particular, whether such effect is amplified for firms further up in the chain as a result of liquidity propagation via trade credit linkages. We uncover evidence of such amplification when the links of liquidity transmission along the chain are individually modeled and estimated. An unitary increase in wholesalers’ sales is found to produce an effect on trade payables among firms at the top of the chain (i. e., Preparers and Spinners) that is more than twice as big as the corresponding effect among firms at the bottom of the chain (i. e., Wholesalers) ...|$|E
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{places a}} considerable burden on patients {{in terms of}} morbidity and mortality and on society in terms of costs. The number of individuals with diabetes is estimated at 160 000 in Norway, 170 mill globally. These numbers are expected to increase considerably in the future. The objective of this thesis was to increase knowledge about the costs and cost-effectiveness of diabetes interventions. The first sub-study explored the economic costs of diabetes in Norway, the second analyzed HRQoL in patients with diabetes and the third explored the cost-effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention. Costs of diabetes Using the prevalence approach, we included costs of in-patient hospital services, outpatient clinic visits, physician services, drugs, medical equipment, nutrition guidance, physiotherapy, acupuncture, foot therapy and indirect costs. Data were collected from national registers and responses to a survey of 584 individuals with diabetes. The total estimated cost of diabetes in Norway in the year 2005 was NOK 4. 2 billion, which represents 2. 4 % of total national health care expenditure. The largest contributors to the costs were drugs, medical devices and hospital admissions. When hospital stays with diabetes as a secondary diagnosis were excluded, total costs were NOK 2. 49 billion. Pharmaceuticals accounted for NOK 808 million (32 %), disability pensions NOK 408 million (16 %), medical devices NOK 340 million (14 %) and hospital admissions NOK 179 million (7 %). Patient expenditures for acupuncture, physiotherapy and foot therapy were many times greater than those of nutritional guidance. Finally, the total costs of lost production from job absenteeism and premature mortality amounted to NOK 596 million. Health-related quality of life in diabetes The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the impact of diabetes complications on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We used the responses from a mail survey performed in Norway and asked about demographics, diabetes related complications and HRQoL using the EQ- 5 D descriptive system. The EQ- 5 D is a standardised instrument for use as a measure for health outcome. It is widely used, and by many governments a recommended instrument for measuring HRQoL. We explored the EQ- 5 D’s ability to capture and represent typical complications related to diabetes. Individuals without any self-reported diabetes complications had HRQoL in the range 0. 85 - 0. 90 on a scale from 0 (death) to 1. 0 (prefect health). HRQoL was largely dependent on the presence of major diabetes related complications. Complications with the most severe impact were stroke, ischemic heart disease and neuropathy. Cost-effectiveness of a diabetes intervention We estimated costs and health outcomes of lifestyle interventions by means of the British UKPDS Outcomes Model. Data on the impact of diet and exercise on diabetes risk factors (HbA 1 c, blood-pressure, cholesterol, and body weight) were taken from a Norwegian trial on individuals with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. Cost and HRQoL data were taken from paper I and II. With immediate switch to insulin the estimated discounted life expectancy was 9. 44 years (7. 67 Quality Adjusted Life Expectancy (QALE)), while it was 9. 48 (7. 71 QALE), 9. 53 (7. 75 QALE) and 9. 64 years (7. 86 QALE) for two years, five years and lifelong lifestyle intervention. The discounted lifetime total costs including indirect costs of the four programmes were NOK 283, 637, NOK 512, 540, NOK 799, 245 and NOK 1, 417, 004, respectively. Compared with immediate switch to insulin, the costs per additional life-year were NOK 6, 053, 073, NOK 6, 209, 362 and NOK 5, 832, 427 for two-year, five-year and lifelong lifestyle intervention, respectively. When the cost of time related to travel and participation in the diet and exercise sessions were disregarded, the costs per incremental QALY for the respective treatment courses were NOK 40, 656, NOK 55, 277 and NOK 33, 649. The results indicate that lifestyle interventions are not cost-effective unless society disregards indirect costs. List of papers. Paper III is removed from the thesis due to copyright restrictions.
