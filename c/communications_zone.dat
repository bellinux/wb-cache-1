500|$|When Eisenhower {{left the}} Mediterranean {{to become the}} Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, Gale {{was one of a}} number of key {{officers}} that Eisenhower insisted on taking with him to his new headquarters, SHAEF. When Field Marshal Brooke demurred at this, Eisenhower's chief of staff, Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith pointed out that Eisenhower had always felt [...] "he would be unwilling to undertake another large Allied Command without Gale's administrative assistance .... He has that irreplaceable quality of being able to handle British-American supply problems with tact and judgement and he is almost as familiar with the American system of supply as with the British." [...] However, General Gale found that while his title at SHAEF was the same, his role was different from that at Allied Force Headquarters. In the Mediterranean he had also had broad responsibility for logistics. In the European theatre, General Bernard Montgomery's 21st Army Group controlled its own supply while the American units had Headquarters, <b>Communications</b> <b>Zone</b> under Major General John C. H. Lee. At SHAEF, Gale had less real control over supply and administration than at Allied Force Headquarters and his duties mostly involved coordinating the activities of the SHAEF staff sections and serving as chairman of various high-level committees that dealt with matters of supply. Gale was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant general in August 1944, and in January 1945 he became Colonel Commandant of the Royal Army Service Corps, a position he held until 1954. He was also colonel commandant of the Army Catering Corps from 1946 to 1958. For his work at SHAEF, he was awarded the U.S. Army Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E

40|$|Group {{communications}} is {{the most}} common requirement in today’s advanced wireless mobile communications. Several mobile applications in MANETs (Mobile Ad hoc Networks) involve group <b>communications</b> among <b>zones</b> and as well as nodes. The most compromising technique for achieving group communications is multicasting and because of advanced developments in technologies multicasting becomes {{as one of the most}} important networking service. However implementing a robust and efficient multicasting is a very challenging task because of multicasting of packet forwarding and efficient group management. Therefore in this paper we propose a systematic novel method known as EGMP (Efficient Geographic Multicast Protocol). To implement scalable and efficient group membership scheme a virtual a virtual-zone-based structure is used. In EGMP, to achieve most efficient group management a zone based bi directional tree is implemented. Here the position information of each individual node is used to construct the zone, multicast tree construction, and multicast packet forwarding, which greatly decreases the overhead for route searching and tree structure maintenance. An efficient distributed algorithm is used in efficient EGMP to support dynamic changes to the multicast group during the construction of tree and effectively allows overlapping join/leave operations. Finally, the simulation results demonstrates that EGMP has excellent packet delivery ratio, low control overhead and multicast group joining delay under all test scenarios, and EGMP is scalable for both group size and network size...|$|R

IEICE TRANSACTIONS on Communications, 1991 Vol. 74 -B No. 5 pp. 1093 - 1102 許諾No. 07 RB 0055. The recent {{progress}} in communication deviceshas reduced {{the cost of}} spread spectrum systems that have beenmainly used in the military field, enabling the possibility of usingspread spectrum systems for Nonmilitary use. Nonmilitary communication networks are classified into two categories: publiccommunication networks and consumer communication networks. At the present, the public communication network shareis much larger {{than that of the}} consumer communication networks. Both of them will increase; however, the consumercommunication network share will be comparable to the publicone. The progress of consumer communications is due to inexpensiveness (without charge), user privacy, free design fromregulations and advantages of local and small <b>zone</b> <b>communications.</b> To overcome fading, power restrictions, interference andinterception is very important for its progress. One of the keytechnologies of consumer communications is the spread spectrum. Consumer communication networks are characterized byuser possession of the network itself in addition to the possessionof personal terminals. From the viewpoint of analogy betweencommunication networks and transportation networks, "frompublic to individual" seems to be today's trend. Several spreadspectrum applications for consumer communications in Japanhave been introduced as follows : a home security system usingpower line communication as a wire spread spectrum communication system; a data carrier, a radio remote control, low-powerradio systems and a clock rate modulation system as radio spreadspectrum communication systems. In addition SAW device applications and digital signal processing applications are introduced...|$|R

Now {{days the}} {{preservation}} of the natural resources have taken a big importance in our country and the world in general. The Costa Rican forests are been threat by illegal practices, like hunting, deforestation and forest fires. That’s why it come the idea to use the electronic knowledge to create a wireless sensor network to monitor these kinds of activities. The goal of this project is to develop a monitor tool that allows the <b>communications</b> between different <b>zones</b> in the forest, so when an alarm is activated, the authorities can perform on time their respective action. Costa Rica has always been internationally famous for his protected zones, making the tourism one of the major incomes for the country and a healthy environment for the people who lives on it. There is the importance of the project since it’s necessary to avoid the irrational exploitation of the natural resources of the country in order to give them to the future generations and they’re a source of income to the national economy. The focus of the project is based on the solution for the wireless communication of the monitor system. It contemplates the hardware and the network protocols. This protocol sees the network like a series of logical levels, so the base {{is going to be in}} a cero level and when the distance of the teledetectors increases, the level is going to increase too. When an alarm is activated, the information is going to flow to the lower levels until it reaches the cero level. Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. Escuela de Ingeniería en Electrónica...|$|R

The Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT) is the designated United States representative to INTELSAT and also performs technical service for INTELSAT in monitoring the design, fabrication, and test of {{communications satellite}}s. The TT&C subsystem consists of two functionally redundant and independent command and telemetry channels, the major elements of which are shown in Figure 1. The telemetry subsystem provides two data channels for formatting and transmitting data received from sensors, transducers, and status indicators in the various subsystems of the spacecraft. In addition, the output of a command receiver can be connected to a telemetry transmitter to form a ranging transponder. The telemetry unit can provide normal or dwell PCM data in NRZ-M format modulated on a 32 KHz subcarrier. The telemetry transmitter phase modulates one of the data subcarriers or ranging tones on a 4 GHz band downlink carrier. The transmitter output is routed directly to an earth coverage conical horn for transmission {{at a level of}} approximately 0. 0 dbW. The transmitter output can also be routed through a <b>zone</b> <b>communications</b> channel TWTA to a telemetry omni-directional bicone antenna for extended coverage. Commands and ranging tones are received on a 6 GHz band uplink carrier through dual Omni pattern antennas. The received signal is routed through a passive filter to the two command receivers where the frequency modulated command or ranging tones are detected. The command tones are routed to the command units for processing. The command transmission is either a command message, consisting of 58 serial bit, or a command execute. The command message includes the address of the command unit which is to be used and what specific command function is to be executed.

40|$|In this work, a swarm {{behaviour}} for multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) deployment will be presented. The main {{contribution of}} this behaviour {{is the use}} of a virtual device for quantitative sematectonic stigmergy providing more adaptable behaviours in complex environments. It is a fault tolerant highly robust behaviour that does not require prior information of the area to be covered, or to assume the existence of any kind of information signals (GPS, mobile communication networks …), taking into account the specific features of UAVs. This behaviour will be oriented towards emergency tasks. Their main goal will be to cover an area of the environment for later creating an ad-hoc communication network, {{that can be used to}} establish <b>communications</b> inside this <b>zone.</b> Although there are several papers on robotic deployment it is more difficult to find applications with UAV systems, mainly because of the existence of various problems that must be overcome including limitations in available sensory and on-board processing capabilities and low flight endurance. In addition, those behaviours designed for UAVs often have significant limitations on their ability to be used in real tasks, because they assume specific features, not easily applicable in a general way. Firstly, in this article the characteristics of the simulation environment will be presented. Secondly, a microscopic model for deployment and creation of ad-hoc networks, that implicitly includes stigmergy features, will be shown. Then, the overall swarm behaviour will be modeled, providing a macroscopic model of this behaviour. This model can accurately predict the number of agents needed to cover an area as well as the time required for the deployment process. An experimental analysis through simulation will be carried out in order to verify our models. In this analysis the influence of both the complexity of the environment and the stigmergy system will be discussed, given the data obtained in the simulation. In addition, the macroscopic and microscopic models will be compared verifying the number of predicted individuals for each state regarding the simulation.
