40|$|While the {{development}} of the nation's entire economy is subordinate to the realization of the task of attaining a high living standard for the people, nonetheless {{a large part of the}} population's needs is chiefly satisfied by light industry and the food industry, by individual branches of machine-building, by agriculture, by transport â for the most part passenger transport â by the construction of housing <b>and</b> <b>cultural,</b> recreational, <b>and</b> <b>service</b> <b>facilities,</b> by trade <b>and</b> public catering. The economic content of the fixed capital of these branches is heterogeneous. Both productive and nonproductive fixed capital are involved here, and in certain branches (e. g., agriculture), only a small share of the productive capital serves the population directly. At the same time, to the extent that it serves the needs of the population, the fixed capital of all the aforementioned branches is characterized by a certain unity â by the communality of the economic purpose of goods produced or of services rendered. (>u> 1 >/u>) For this reason, in evaluating the effectiveness of production on a territorial scale, expenditures on all of the aforementioned branches directly serving the population should be compared on a regional basis. ...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{quality of}} life is {{currently}} conceptualized in principally economic terms. As the decline in manufacturing activities, the rise of the <b>service</b> <b>and</b> knowledge economy, the growing importance of accessibility and globalizing processes continue to reconfigure the economic competition between cities, {{quality of life}} enters the discourse primarily as a means to attract high-skilled workers and improve the city’s economic prospects. Local governments increasingly seek partnerships with local and foreign capital, reorganizing institutions and tasks to attract capital, including the “selling of place”, strengthening place promotion and marketing efforts. The rhetoric clearly welcomes wealthy, creative, high-skilled people, disadvantaged and low skilled groups receive less attention in the making of places. Especially with respect to inner city areas, high {{quality of life is}} promoted as spaces for ‘clean’ and convenient consumption with positive atmospheres and shiny images. Yet, a plethora of theoretical engagements with urban everyday live reminds us that, while on the one hand, variety of jobs, quality of public spaces, range of shops <b>and</b> <b>services,</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>facilities</b> <b>and</b> public transport are important place characteristics, more subjective aspects such as safe neighbourhoods, well-being, community prospects, social cohesion, happiness, satisfaction and social and spatial justice are equally crucial determinants of urban quality of life. These elements of urban quality of life – and how they are experienced by diverse formations of urban inhabitants – seem to be absent from, if not at odds with, the dominant discourse in rankings, policy and practice. Urban life, social cohesion and complexity are at risk in the dynamics of modernization and adaptation strategies of cities. Gentrification, the occupation of inner-city districts by hyper-rich people, segregation and displacement of lower and middle classes can be observed as a consequence of these long-lasting strategies. Well-known sociologists and geographers from the UK and Germany have presented their insights on the matter and debate theoretical and empirical attempts to capture the dynamics of urban processes in shaping the quality of life. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{concerned to}} establish the relationship between urban form and social sustainabilityin two Malaysian cities. Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya are the two cities selected purposely as the case study cities because of their distinctive characteristics. Specifically, this research looks in detail at the aspect of access to local <b>services</b> <b>and</b> <b>facilities</b> according to different aspects of urban form, such as density, building/ housing type, land use mix and layout. Urban form elements such as mixed land use and density appear to have significant impact on access and usage pattern of certain local <b>services</b> <b>and</b> <b>facilities</b> located within the case study cities (Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya). Another important factor towards higher access to <b>services</b> <b>and</b> <b>facilities</b> within the neighbourhood is the respondents‘ perceptions of mobility. Aspects of safety also impact on the access and usage pattern of the respondents towards the <b>services</b> <b>and</b> local <b>facilities</b> within their local neighbourhood. However, satisfaction towards the neighbourhood does not influence the access or usage pattern of the local <b>services</b> <b>and</b> <b>facilities.</b> The research provides {{one of the first}} attempts to investigate the relationship between urban form and its impact upon social sustainability in Malaysian cities., It exposes local issues and problems related to the access and usage of local <b>services</b> <b>and</b> <b>facilities</b> within residential neighbourhoods which corresponds with issues highlighted in the National Urbanisation Policy (NUP) (Federal Department of Town and Country Planning Peninsular Malaysia, 2006). Findings suggest that local planning authorities should ensure that residential neighbourhood/ developments are well connected to local <b>services</b> <b>and</b> <b>facilities</b> – by improving public transport & pedestrian networks. It is also important that neighbourhood safety is properly addressed...|$|R
