Rather than just combining collections of segments, rods can be joined end-to-end, which illustrates another conception of addition: adding not the rods but the lengths of the rods.|$|E

5|$|Thorium tetrafluoride {{is used as}} an antireflection {{material}} in multilayered optical coatings. It has an optical transparency {{in the range of}} 0.35–12µm, and its radiation is primarily due to alpha particles, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> stopped by a thin cover layer of another material.

5|$|A {{computer}} {{can act as}} one or {{all three of these}} components at the same time. The Xgrid protocol provides the basic infrastructure for computers to communicate, but is not involved in the processing of the specified calculation.

This includes Monte Carlo calculations, 3D rendering and Mandelbrot maps.|$|E
5|$|Actinium-227 {{is used as}} {{a neutron}} source. Its high {{specific}} energy (14.5 W/g) and the possibility of obtaining significant quantities of thermally stable compounds are attractive for use in long-lasting thermoelectric generators for remote use. 228Ac {{is used as a}}n indicator of radioactivity in chemical research, as it emits high-energy electrons (2.18 MeV) that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> detected. 228Ac-228Ra mixtures are widely used as an intense gamma-source in industry and medicine.|$|E

5|$|Diamonds are {{naturally}} lipophilic and hydrophobic, {{which means the}} diamonds' surface cannot be wet by water, but <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> wet and stuck by oil.

5|$|In addition, {{like all}} Nepenthes, this plant needs a fairly humid {{environment}} to grow well. Values {{in the region}} of 75% R.H. are generally considered optimal, with increased humidity at night (~90% R.H.). However, N. rajah does tolerate fluctuations in humidity, especially when young, provided that the air does not become too dry (below 50% R.H.). Humidity <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> controlled using an ultrasonic humidifier in conjunction with a humidistat.|$|E

The standard reduction {{potential of the}} E°(Md3+→Md2+) couple was variously estimated in 1967 as −0.10V or −0.20V: later 2013 experiments established the value as /Md2+ Reduction Potential Studied with Flow Electrolytic Chromatography |journal=Inorganic Chemistry |volume=52 |issue=21 |pages=12311–3 |doi=10.1021/ic401571h}} In comparison, E°(Md3+→Md0) should be around −1.74V, and E°(Md2+→Md0) should be around −2.5V. Mendelevium(II)'s elution behavior has been {{compared with that of}} strontium(II) and europium(II).|$|E

In a flame test, potassium and its compounds emit a lilac color with a peak emission wavelength of 766.5 nanometers.|$|E
5|$|Reversible inhibitors {{attach to}} enzymes with non-covalent {{interactions}} such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and ionic bonds. Multiple weak bonds between the inhibitor and the active site combine to produce strong and specific binding. In contrast to substrates and irreversible inhibitors, reversible inhibitors {{generally do not}} undergo chemical reactions when bound to the enzyme and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> removed by dilution or dialysis.|$|E
5|$|Similar to humans, gray wolves have facial color {{patterns}} {{in which the}} gaze direction <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> identified, although this is often {{not the case in}} other canid species. In 2014, a study compared the facial color pattern across 25 canid species. The results suggested that the facial color pattern of canid species is related to their gaze communication, and that especially gray wolves use the gaze signal in conspecific communication.|$|E

5|$|Actinium trifluoride can be {{produced}} either in solution or in solid reaction. The former reaction is carried out at room temperature, by adding hydrofluoric acid to a solution containing actinium ions. In the latter method, actinium metal is treated with hydrogen fluoride vapors at 700°C in an all-platinum setup. Treating actinium trifluoride with ammonium hydroxide at 900–1000°C yields oxyfluoride AcOF. Whereas lanthanum oxyfluoride <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> obtained by burning lanthanum trifluoride in air at 800°C for an hour, similar treatment of actinium trifluoride yields no AcOF and only results in melting of the initial product.|$|E
