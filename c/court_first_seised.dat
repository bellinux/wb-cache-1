50|$|First, Article 27 (2012 recast: Article 29) of the Regulation {{contains}} the lis alibi pendens rule: proceedings involving the same cause {{and between the}} same parties brought in the courts of different Member States must be stayed until {{the jurisdiction of the}} <b>court</b> <b>first</b> <b>seised</b> has been established, after which it must decline jurisdiction.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{applications}} for declaratory relief {{in other areas}} have become more widespread, particularly in Europe. A key feature in relation to this development has been the Brussels and Lugano Conventions on civil jurisdiction and judgments relating {{to members of the}} European Economic Area (EEA). In certain circumstances, jurisdiction is awarded under the conventions to the courts first seised of the matter. This has led to a rise in defendants taking pre-emptive action by seeking [...] "declarations of non-liability" [...] in a race to the courthouse to ensure that they choose the <b>court</b> <b>first</b> <b>seised</b> rather than waiting for the claimant to do so.|$|E
5000|$|MISAT {{relied on}} Article 21 of the Brussels Convention, a {{convention}} {{to which all}} members of the European Community were party, and which regulates which court within those states has jurisdiction. The convention contains a lis alibi pendens-rule: where proceedings involving the same issue and between the same parties are brought before the courts of different Member States, the court seised second must stay proceedings up until the jurisdiction of the <b>court</b> <b>first</b> <b>seised</b> has been established - after which the court second seised must decline jurisdiction if the <b>court</b> <b>first</b> <b>seised</b> is indeed found to have jurisdiction. Consequently, Article 21 of the Convention establishes a type of [...] "first come, first served"-rule: when there is a triple identity in parties, object, as well as cause of action, the court that has been seised second will only be able to decide in the case when it has been decided in the first court that the latter has no jurisdiction. The Report Jenard cites the need to [...] "facilitate the proper administration of justice within the Community" [...] as the underlying idea behind this lis alibi pendens rule, as irreconcilable judgments would obstruct such proper administration and ultimately be detrimental to the [...] "mutual trust in the administration of justice in the Community". Consequently, the lis pendens-rule can be considered as an expression of the Regulation's search for both certainty and the preservation of mutual trust amongst Member States.|$|E
50|$|Finally, Article 29 (2012 recast: Article 31(1)) of the Regulation {{states that}} when actions {{fall within the}} {{exclusive}} jurisdiction {{of more than one}} court, any other <b>court</b> than the <b>first</b> <b>seised</b> must decline jurisdiction in favour of that court. This can for example happen under the ancillary rule regarding holiday housing in Article 22(1) of the Regulation (2012 recast: Article 24(1)) that gives both the Member State in which the holiday house is situated jurisdiction as the Member State in which the defendant is domiciled.|$|R

5000|$|First, {{there is}} the (unlikely) risk that the <b>court</b> <b>first</b> <b>seised</b> finds the {{jurisdiction}} clause invalid, which consequently takes away the possibility for the designated court to decide the case, even if the latter would have declared the clause valid. Although the Court in Gasser first seems to minimise the likelihood of this hypothesis by stating that a jurisdiction clause [...] "must be regarded as an independent concept", it nonetheless points out that verifying the existence of jurisdiction clauses [...] "may necessitate delicate and costly investigations". As a result, although unlikely, {{there is still a}} risk that two courts from different Member States will decide upon the validity of a jurisdiction clause differently.|$|E
5000|$|The Court resolutely {{rejected}} {{the possibility that}} the party autonomy could take precedence over the abovementioned goals of certainty and mutual trust, stating that [...] "the court second seised is never in a better position than the <b>court</b> <b>first</b> <b>seised</b> to determine whether the latter has jurisdiction". Even though the Austrian court was consistent with the parties choice-of-court agreement, it was for the court first seized to decide it had not jurisdiction and the presence of such a clause is [...] "not such as to call in question the application of the procedural rule contained in Article 21 of the Convention Article 27, which is based clearly and solely on the chronological order in which the courts involved are seised".|$|E
50|$|Second, Article 28 (2012 recast: Article 30) of the Regulation {{functions}} {{as a sort of}} ‘safety-net‘ for actions which do not meet the above-mentioned requirements, but where the actions are nonetheless ‘related’: “they are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings”. As a consequence, Article 28(2) of the Regulation defines that any court other than the <b>court</b> <b>first</b> <b>seised</b> may, on the application of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction in favour of the first court for actions pending at first instance. Fitting in the general objective of avoiding conflicting judgments and facilitating proper administration, ‘related actions‘ must be interpreted broadly; therefore, all cases that carry a risk of conflicting judgments, even if the judgments can be separately enforced and have no mutually exclusive legal consequences, can be considered related cases {{for the purposes of this}} article.|$|E

5000|$|The European Court of Justice {{ruled in}} Overseas Union Insurance Ltd. v New Hampshire Insurance Co. (1991) [...] that Article 27 {{applies to all}} {{proceedings}} commenced in the courts of the European Union regardless of the habitual residence or domicile of the parties. The Article provides for the <b>court</b> <b>first</b> <b>seised</b> to have priority in the same cause of action between the same parties without giving a second court the right to examine the first court's grounds for accepting jurisdiction with Article 27(2) imposing a mandatory duty on the second court to decline any jurisdiction unless the first court determines not to accept jurisdiction. This places a duty on the first court {{to make the decision}} expeditiously. In Turner v Grovit judgment on April 27, 2004, an English court, being the first court seised, issued an injunction to restrain one of the parties from pursuing the proceedings they had commenced in Spain. Even where the defendant is acting in bad faith with the intention of frustrating the existing proceedings, the issue of an injunction was inconsistent with the Convention. The English court should trust the Spanish court to apply Article 27(2) (Blanke: 2004).|$|E
5000|$|Second, the Court's ruling, which {{imposes a}} sort of {{absolute}} first-come, first-served principle, promotes the use of tactical litigation and [...] "torpedo claims". The reason why {{can be described as}} the difference between theory and reality. In theory, the fact that a party would have to turn to a different Member State for a ruling in his case is irrelevant or even meaningless, as the Brussels I Regulation rests upon the axiomatic assumption that procedural justice is served wherever in the community proceedings are heard. In reality however, this fact is of great tactical significance to the recalcitrant party, since -apart from the aforementioned fact that the first court seised may determine the effect of Article 23 differently- some Member States have a system of much slower-moving judiciary, which makes the realisation of procedural justice unlikely. Italy is a prime example thereof, with decisions on jurisdiction alone taking several months or even years; commencing proceedings in Italy is accordingly dubbed [...] "firing the Italian torpedo". This torpedo may well sink a jurisdiction agreement, as the crude confrontation with increased delay and expense for the other party makes it not only unlikely for him to recommence proceedings in the agreed court after jurisdiction has been settled, but can even deter him from litigating altogether {{at the sight of the}} location of the <b>court</b> <b>first</b> <b>seised.</b>|$|E
