25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of computer networks, {{there has been a}} persistent need for client systems which can boot appropriate software images, with appropriate <b>configuration</b> <b>parameters,</b> both retrieved at boot time from one or more network servers. This goal requires a client to use a set of pre-boot services, based on industry standard network protocols. Additionally, the Network Bootstrap Program (NBP) which is initially downloaded and run must be built using a client firmware layer (at the device to be bootstrapped via PXE) providing a hardware independent standardized way to interact with the surrounding network booting environment. In this case the availability and subjection to standards are a key factor required to guarantee the network boot process system interoperability.|$|E

The requirements, <b>configurations</b> and <b>parameters</b> of the adaptable product are modeled as functions of the life-cycle time parameter. The adaptable product is changed to different <b>configurations</b> and <b>parameters</b> to satisfy the different requirements in different life-cycle time periods.

40|$|As an {{important}} part of the next generation network, Internet of things is affecting every aspect of our lives. Now an accepted the conclusion is that M 2 M technology is the specific form of concrete implementation of Internet of things in current conditions. In order to realize the machine to machine communication, the communication protocol between the terminal and platform is necessary. As the leader of IoT in China, China Mobile has published Wireless Machine Management Protocol (or WMMP, in short). WMMP is a set of very complete M 2 M protocol specification and it is easy to program on all kinds of embedded device. The critical function of WMMP is a set of mechanism which manages all connecting devices. The management mechanism includes the following parts: device register, login, <b>configuration</b> <b>parameter</b> setting, <b>configuration</b> <b>parameter</b> getting, <b>configuration</b> <b>parameter</b> report, remote control, application data transmitting and firmware updating. In this paper, the related knowledge of WMMP is introduced and the how to applied it in a medical device is also discussed.
