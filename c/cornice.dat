5|$|Notable in Western Chalukya {{architecture}} are {{the decorative}} door panels that {{run along the}} length of the door and over on top to form a lintel. These decorations appear as bands of delicately chiseled fretwork, moulded colonettes and scrolls scribed with tiny figures. The bands are separated by deep narrow channels and grooves and run over the top of the door. The temple plan often included a heavy slanting <b>cornice</b> of double curvature, which projected outward from the roof of the open mantapa. This was intended to reduce heat from the sun, blocking the harsh sunlight and preventing rainwater from pouring in between the pillars. The underside of the <b>cornice</b> looks like woodwork because of the rib-work. Occasionally, a straight slabbed <b>cornice</b> is seen.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Ellwood's 1898-1899 renovations were superficial, {{especially}} {{when compared to}} the alterations his son made to the original design a decade later. He had the bracketed <b>cornice</b> replaced with a Classical <b>cornice</b> with dentils and a projecting molding. The window lintels were altered in a style similar to the new <b>cornice.</b> On the tower, the two windows on the first floor were replaced with one larger window while the projecting bay over the east portico was removed and made flush {{with the rest of the}} house. The windows over that portico were replaced with a heavy double door that opened onto the roof over the veranda, which had been built over the entire front of the house. It was during this time that the first porte-cochere was built on the south side of the home.|$|E
5|$|The outward {{appearance}} of the Zytglogge {{is determined by the}} 1770 renovation. Only the late Gothic <b>cornice</b> below the roof and the stair tower are visible artifacts of the tower's earlier history.|$|E
50|$|In {{avalanche}} safety, <b>cornices</b> are a high avalanche danger as {{they often}} break and trigger larger avalanches that permeate several snow layers. <b>Cornices</b> are particularly vulnerable to collapse during periods of solar warming.|$|R
5000|$|All {{rooms in}} the {{building}} have [...] "intricately designed parquet floors". The main entrance hall has an open staircase, molded <b>cornices,</b> and a red marble fireplace. The semi-circular library has a wood-panelled ceiling, a fireplace and bookcases. The former billiard room has molded <b>cornices,</b> dado, and sliding interior shutters. The parlor and dining room have molded <b>cornices,</b> glazed sliding doors, and red marble fireplaces. Some of the other rooms have fireplaces and the semi-circular master bedroom has a sleeping porch.|$|R

5|$|In the 1930s, the {{building}} was the downtown headquarters for over 30 railroad companies. Around 1950, the terra-cotta <b>cornice</b> {{was removed from the}} Marquette Building when an additional story was added. The building has been in continuous use as an office building since its construction.|$|E
5|$|Its façade {{was simply}} {{decorated}} by narrow pilasters and niches of saints. A bas relief of the church's secondary patron, San Vicente Ferrer, was prominently {{located on the}} center of the facade. A string of finely cut coral stones, molded into flowers, could be seen on the lower <b>cornice</b> of the facade. Beside the façade was an extension of a bulky belfry.|$|E
5|$|The centrepiece {{is thought}} to have been built by the {{architect}} Mederico Blondel based on a design by Mattia Preti. The main entrance and the corners of the building are rusticated. Each of the three floors contains a set of six windows, and a <b>cornice</b> runs along the façade {{between the first and second}} floors.|$|E
5|$|The Round Church {{featured}} {{marble and}} limestone <b>cornices.</b> These included {{a large number}} of intertwined ornaments and details, such as palmettes, grape clusters, leaves, and chamfers. Besides classic ornamental shapes, the <b>cornices</b> feature some that are entirely new in character or well-known yet redesigned motifs. Floral decoration dominates the <b>cornices.</b> Tiles found inside the church ruins depict birds and other animals in addition to geometric shapes and floral motifs, all glazed in either brown, yellow, green, blue, or blue-green. The walls were covered in polished marble facing with encrusted shapes.|$|R

5|$|The {{climb up}} or down from the summit plateau onto Swirral Edge is another well known {{accident}} spot. In winter it involves climbing down another snow <b>cornice</b> onto steep icy ground. There {{have been a number}} of accidents at this spot in recent years, making it as dangerous as Striding Edge.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} is panelled to dado level {{and in the}} Music Room there is a <b>cornice</b> decorated with swags and paterae and a marble fireplace decorated with cupids, urns and more swags. The music room is situated at {{the eastern end of}} the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|The mansion's roof {{is covered}} by gray slate and is further embellished with three dormer windows facing from the home's front façade. The roof is topped by a balustraded deck. Similar {{moulding}} contours were used at varying scales throughout the mansion's exterior construction. The mansion's <b>cornice</b> is composed of ornamented moldings.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} features Australian Red Cedar and ornate tiles, plaster {{ceilings and}} <b>cornices.</b>|$|R

5|$|There is {{an ornate}} {{semi-circular}} wooden ceiling with smaller panels along the ridge, moulded ribs and carved bosses, and brattished <b>cornice</b> each side above {{a row of}} little fan-vaults separating seven half-round panels with shield-bearing angels. The ceiling is finely finished with bosses {{at the intersection of}} the moulded principals and purlins. It was inserted in 1882–84.|$|E
5|$|A former hearse {{house at}} the {{southeast}} corner of the churchyard dates from about 1833, and has been converted for use as an electricity sub-station. It is a rectangular single-story building of red sandstone with a quarry tile roof. The door opening at the front has a wide semicircular arch with a keystone and springing blocks, above which is a string course and a <b>cornice</b> with moulded eaves. On the west side and at the rear are small vents with semicircular heads and keystones. The hearse house is listed at GradeII.|$|E
5|$|Classical {{sculpture}} {{covers the}} pediment above the front colonnade, with {{the seal of}} the State of Illinois dominating the relief. Stained glass windows can be found topping the third floor windows. The <b>cornice</b> on the roof consists of three rows of eight balustrades and stone blocks. A common decorative ornament in Greek Revival and Classical Revival architecture {{can be found in}} an anthemion {{at the peak of the}} pediment. The courthouse roof is enclosed in stonework and balustrades.|$|E

There are, therefore, two {{distinct}} features in all <b>cornices</b> of this kind; first, the bracket, now become of enormous importance and of most serious practical service; the second, the parapet: {{and these two}} features we shall consider in succession, and in so doing, shall learn all that is needful for us to know, not only respecting <b>cornices,</b> but respecting brackets in general, and balconies.|$|R
5|$|Plans {{for the new}} chapel {{were drawn}} up by J.H.Perkins, a local school master, with seating for 2,500. In 1859 a {{colonnade}} {{was added to the}} front of the chapel, with a window and <b>cornice</b> above. This was designed by Staffordshire architect Robert Scrivener. Further alterations were made in 1887, including the extension of the minister's vestry, replacement of the windows and renewal and restoration of the pews.|$|E
5|$|Platform A4 {{divides the}} Group A plaza in two. It was a later {{addition}} to Group A during the reorganisation {{of the group}} that involved the destruction of the earlier building under Platform A5. When excavated it was very poorly reserved but was able to be reliably restored. There was no earlier version of the structure; it consists of a platform with two levels that faces east towards the principal architecture of Group A. The upper level is topped with a <b>cornice</b> and access was via two stairways flanked by balustrades.|$|E
5|$|Striding Edge is {{a notorious}} {{accident}} spot among hikers and scramblers. In winter conditions the climb from Striding Edge {{up to the}} summit plateau can involve crossing steep icy ground and a snow <b>cornice,</b> and {{can be the most}} dangerous part of the walk. Without an ice axe or crampons this presents a serious obstacle. In January 2008 two walkers died after falling from the ridge in separate incidents. Another walker died after falling from Striding Edge in May 2008.|$|E

5|$|The Fire Station Number 4 is architecturally {{significant}} {{as an example}} of a late 19th-century Queen Anne-style firehouse. The firehouse's distinguishing feature is the corbeled <b>cornice</b> and terracotta trim, but also it is historically {{significant as}} an example of Pawtucket's maturation as a city. The boundary for the property is listed as Plat 7B, lot 164 and includes the surrounding area, totaling less than one acre. Fire Station Number 4 was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 18, 1983.|$|E
5|$|The Tetrapylon {{was erected}} during the renovations of Diocletian {{at the end}} of the third century. It is a square {{platform}} and each corner contains a grouping of four columns. Each column group supports a 150 tons <b>cornice</b> and contains a pedestal in its center that originally carried a statue. Out of sixteen columns, only one is original while the rest are from reconstruction work by the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities in 1963, using concrete. The original columns were brought from Egypt and carved out of pink granite.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the original building is attributed to Nicholas Hawksmoor, with some alterations from around 1900 and the subsequent modern 1960s extensions. The original mansion is in the Queen Anne style. The house itself has three storeys constructed of red brick. The ground floor level has a rubbed brick band at nine courses, and another rubbed brick band exists on the second floor, along with a moulded stone <b>cornice</b> level with the sills.|$|E
50|$|As a late {{example of}} Italianate the T. Goings Building lacks the {{elaborate}} window detailings of the district's other Italianate structures. Despite this, the building does have elaborate <b>cornices.</b> The wood <b>cornices</b> have brackets set atop brick piers, with finials atop. They are constructed of clapboard with the brackets and organic appliques {{in between the}} piers. The storefronts are historic and include some original doors and cast-iron pilasters.|$|R
50|$|The facade is {{decorated}} with different decorative elements. These include a meandering band on the eaves of the <b>cornices</b> {{and a number of}} decorative elements on windows and doors, such as ventilation holes in the <b>cornices</b> over the windows. The window elements facing the tracks are richly decorated. Manfred Berger stated in 1980 that the building was a functional, yet beautiful building that was amazing for this small town in Brandenburg.|$|R
50|$|The Tuftonboro United Methodist Church {{is located}} in the rural village center of Tuftonboro, {{on the north side of}} NH 171 a short way east of its {{junction}} with Durgin Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. A two-stage square tower rises from the roof ridge, with a plain first stage and a belfry stage topped by an octagonal spire. Both stages have pilastered corners and a <b>corniced</b> entablature; the belfry has rectangular openings topped by blind half round panels. The main facade is symmetrical, with a pair of entrances, each flanked by pilasters, sidelight windows, and outer pilasters, and topped by entablatures and peaked <b>cornices.</b> Windows on the second level also have peaked <b>cornices.</b>|$|R
