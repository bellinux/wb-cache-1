30|$|Significant {{variations}} in the qualities of products occur when resids are proportionally incorporated into the conventional VGO feedstock. The FCC catalysts are easier to deactivate along with higher delta coke formation and metal deposition, leading to reduced conversion of feedstock. Generally, four types of coke form in the FCC process: catalytic coke formed during the cracking reactions; contaminant coke from the activity of contaminant metals such as Ni and V; feed coke from the con-carbon in the feed; cat-to-oil coke from “unstripped” hydrocarbons that carry over into the regenerator. The severe deactivation from coke formation and metal contamination after resid incorporation is unavoidable, as a result dry gas yields including hydrogen and <b>slurry</b> <b>oil</b> yield increase while gasoline selectivity decreases.|$|R

However, when the FCC unit is blended with a certain amount (generally less than 20 wt%) of CGO, the activity and selectivity of catalyst decrease, the feedstock conversion drops, recycle <b>oil</b> and <b>slurry</b> <b>oil</b> withdrawal increase, the yield of coke increases, product distribution deteriorates, and CGO bending ratio becomes strictly limited [1, 2, 3]. Earlier works [4, 5] on this subject concluded that nitrogen compounds in CGO, especially basic nitrogen compounds, could heavily deactivate FCC catalysts. The poisonous basic nitrogen compounds could reversibly adsorb onto the acid site of catalyst, resulting in a diminution of acid centers, or acted as coke precursors due to their size and aromatic nature [6]. Fu and schaffer [7] and Ho et al. [8] proposed that nitrogen content, proton affinity, and molecular size (or molecular weight) of basic nitrogen compounds were the key factors affecting the performance of FCC. Nevertheless, Li et al. [9, 10] argued that the effect of structure and composition of basic nitrogen compounds was much more obvious than that of nitrogen content. Consequently, the characterizing nitrogen compounds in CGO and investigating the nitrogen compounds how to deactivate FCC catalysts have become research hotspots.|$|R

Slurry sludge was used a source of water in concrete production, which was obtained from Samara factory/Jordan, The physico-chemical and mineralogical characterization of the sludge was carried out to identify the major components and to compare it with the typical sand used to produce concrete. Samples analysis showed that 96 % of slurry sludge volume is water, so it {{should be considered as}} an important source of water. Results indicated that the use of slurry sludge as water source in concrete production has insignificant effect on compression strength, while it has a sharp effect on the slump values. Using slurry sludge with a percentage of 25 % of the total water content obtained successful concrete samples regarding slump and compression tests. To <b>clarify</b> <b>slurry</b> sludge, settling process can be used to remove the suspended solid. A settling period of 30 min. obtained 99 % removal efficiency. The clarified water is suitable for using in concrete mixes, which reduce water consumption, conserve water recourses, increase the profit, reduce operation cost and save the environment. Additionally, the dry sludge could be used in the mix design instead of the fine materials with sizes < 160 �m.

Both types of structured catalysts were studied using the following physicochemical techniques: specific surface area measurements (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Pd(2 wt %) [Fe-Al oxide catalyst used for monolith coating does not undergo any textural or crystallinity modification during the deposition procedure. Catalytic activities obtained for powder and monolithic catalysts are compared. The Surface of the support plays an important role in the structuration of catalysts.

Also to be presented in this paper is the adoption and application of CiDRA’s SONARtrac™ product technology in a variety of oil sands, oil & gas, and minerals processing applications, helping to address the needs of measurement integrity, reliability and value delivery to the customer. In addition, case studies will be presented describing how the clamp-on sonar-based technology can be leveraged and applied to help characterize and deliver new insight into fluid mechanics of slurries and fluids in these industries, leveraging the two fundamental measurements of the clamp-on, passive sonar-based technology into new product extensions such as velocity profiling, gas hold-up for column flotation and secondary-phase measurement for density-based meters in the presence of air/gas...|$|R
30|$|Titanium dioxide is {{the most}} widely used white pigment because of its {{brightness}} and very high refractive index, in which it is surpassed only by a few other materials. TiO 2 is unique because it efficiently scatters visible light, thereby imparting whiteness, brightness, and opacity when incorporated into a coating. Dry compacted TiO 2 samples are characterized by their brightness and whiteness and exhibit reflectance properties approaching that of the perfect reflecting diffuser. ‘Color’ is carefully controlled during the TiO 2 manufacturing process through the removal of the trace amounts of metal oxide contaminants. These light-absorbing contaminants will detract from the brightness and whiteness of the pigment and can affect the appearance of white and near-white paints containing that pigment. The opacity of white pigments mainly derives from the scattering, while the opacity of black pigments is a result of absorption ability[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. It was observed that if the TiO 2 is produced in a commercial production plant on particular days when there is oil leak in the larox filter, the color and brightness of the produced pigment failed when measured the same in acrylic lacquer paint (vehicle b). Also, this failure is not seen when the color and brightness are measured in dry mode (dry b). These observations were not a single case but were seen occasionally in the quality analysis. The failure in the vehicle color, once commenced, was seen continued consecutively with three to four final products. The sources of oil contamination during the manufacturing process can be as follows: In the chloride process of manufacturing TiO 2, rutile or high-grade ilmenite is converted to titanium tetrachloride (TiCl 4) gas. The conversion takes place in a chlorinator (i.e., fluidized bed reactor) in the presence of chlorine gas at 850 °C to 950 °C, with petroleum coke added as a reductant. The chief reaction products are volatile metal chlorides, including TiCl 4, which are collected. The nonvolatile chlorides and the unreacted solids that remain in the chlorinator are wasted, forming the special waste stream ‘chloride process waste solids’. The gaseous raw product stream is purified to separate the titanium tetrachloride from other chlorides. Separation is by fractional condensation, double distillation, and chemical treatment. Ferric chloride (FeCl 3) is removed as a major acidic liquid waste stream through fractional condensation. Additional trace metal chlorides are removed through double distillation. Finally, vanadium oxychloride (VOCl 3), which has a boiling point close to that of TiCl 4 (136 °C), is removed as a low-volume non-special waste by complexing with mineral oil and reduced with hydrogen sulfide to VOCl 2 or by complexing with copper. The purified TiCl 4 is then oxidized to TiO 2 at 985 °C, driving off chlorine gas, which is recycled to the chlorinator. Aluminum chloride is added in the oxidation step to promote formation of the rutile crystal which is the TiO 2 product. The next stage of TiO 2 manufacturing is surface treatment, where the TiO 2 from oxidizer is converted to slurry in water, which is then subjected to sand milling to the required particle size. The <b>clarified</b> <b>slurry</b> from the sand mill is treated with alumina or zirconia for coating the surface of bare titanium dioxide with amorphous aluminum or zirconium oxide. The surface-treated product is then filtered through larox by pressing and followed by organic treatment and spin flash drying. Finally, the dried product is subjected to micronization process to get the surface-treated product. The brightness and color of this product is important for its marketing.|$|R
40|$|A labscale {{pressure}} filter has beer, developed {{to study the}} filtration behaviour of diluted crude palm <b>oil</b> <b>slurry.</b> The apparatus mainly consists of two parts viz. a mixer and a filter which are placed in a oven for controlling operating temperature. The system is connected to a data acquisition system for recording data of applied pressure, medium pressure, filter temperature, weight of filtrate and mixer speed in a spread sheet. Filtration of DCPOS was carried out at a temperature range 60 C â€“ 90 C and applied pressure 1 bar - 4 bar using a polyester multifilament woven cloth as filter medium. The results {{have shown that the}} filter System Was fully capable and suitable to be used to study filtration behaviour of DCPOS. The optimum process condition to give he highest filtration rate was at 2 bar and 90 C. The effect of pressure and temperature to the filtrate flowrate and cake compressibility were also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Hydrated filler-type {{flame retardants}} were coated with {{approximately}} a monolayer of stearic acid using a solvent technique. Compared to the uncoated powders, the BET surface area was lower, the powder packing density was improved, and the thickening effect on white oil was significantly reduced. The latter two observations are rationalized {{in terms of}} a reduction in the attractive interactions between the powder particles. The viscosity of white <b>oil</b> <b>slurries</b> containing 25 wt % solids showed shear-thinning non-Newtonian behavior. The coated powders showed significantly lower viscosities at low shear rates although the difference diminished at high shear rates. The lower viscosities shown by the coated powders indicate that the surface modification facilitated the break-up of agglomerates and the dispersion of individual particles in the fluid.
