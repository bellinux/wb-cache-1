Increasing nitrogen levels promote competitive grass {{species such as}} Molinia caerulea, which is a main threat to heathland conservation in Europe. This article investigates the long-term influence of sod cutting and the resulting changes in soil properties on the heath composition, integrity, and structure. In 15 nature reserves across the northern half of Belgium, we used (1) {{a large number of}} plots (203); (2) a broad range of sod cut depths (2 – 40 cm), and (3) a temporal dimension that describes how long the effects of sod cutting persist (census up to 19 years after sod cutting). Multivariate analyses were used in order to explore the influence of sod <b>cut</b> <b>depth</b> and time after sod cutting on the soil and vegetation properties. There was a positive relationship between sod <b>cut</b> <b>depth</b> and soil pH and water level, and a negative relationship with Al 3 +, NH 4 +, and total organic matter (TOM).

Moreover, M. caerulea reappeared and its cover significantly increased during the years following sod cutting. Although we were able to show that sod <b>cut</b> <b>depth</b> has a differential effect on soil properties and vegetation recovery, it also appeared that sod cutting does not restore wet heaths in the long term when applied in regions with high nitrogen deposition.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{contribution}} is to investigate problems connected with the application of plain water jets in surroundings between jet outlet and target differing from standard atmosphere. Two cases are especially interesting from the practical viewpoint. Application of water jets under the water level, i. e., in pressurized water: it is sometimes necessary to perform certain reparations on dam walls, bridge pillars, and other structures under the water level without emptying the dam or changing the river flow. The second case particularly involves water jets used for cleaning of chemical or radioactive facilities, which is much safer if done in underpressure. By these reasons, behavior of plain water jets on several different rock materials was tested inside the pressure vessel with the application of normal air pressure, air underpressure, and water overpressure. The effectiveness of rock material disintegration by water jet in various environmental conditions has been described. The depth of penetration decreases with increasing water overpressure, approximately with the second degree of the overpressure value. The <b>cut</b> <b>depth</b> decreases with the increasing value of certain material characteristics.
