The results indicated that the incubation time increased as the incubation temperature was reduced and the casein concentration was increased. Kefir samples incubated at 25 °C showed the highest values of viscosity, while the samples incubated at 30 °C exhibited the lowest viscosity. The addition of <b>caseinates</b> caused the viscosity of the samples to increase and their flow behaviour index values to decrease.

Conjugation with ribose and glucose increased the viscosity of <b>caseinate</b> 28 -fold over that of the unmodified <b>caseinate</b> control but also produced the most browning. Glycoconjugates of caseinate–fructose reacted at a substrate ratio of 1 : 0. 2 w/w and 60 °C at 67 % relative humidity for 48 h increased the viscosity of <b>caseinate</b> 24 -fold with less browning. At 80 % relative humidity the reaction occurred so rapidly that, within 24 h gels containing darkly coloured particulate matter were produced. Incorporation of inulin at 1 : 1 : 0. 2 w/w/w caseinate/inulin/fructose prevented formation of gels and produced glycoconjugates having 15 -fold the viscosity of unmodified <b>caseinate</b> with minimal browning...|$|R

WPC 80, sodium <b>caseinate</b> and their hydrolysates were then analyzed, compared and evaluated for their nutritional qualities. Their chemical composition, protein solubility, amino acid composition, essential amino acid index (EAA index), biological value (BV), nutritional index (NI), chemical score, enzymic protein efficiency ratio (E-PER) and in vitro protein digestibility (IVPD) were determined. The {{results indicated that the}} enzymatic hydrolysis of WPC 80 and sodium <b>caseinate</b> by Protamex improved the solubility and IVPD of their hydrolysates. WPC 80, sodium <b>caseinate</b> and their hydrolysates were high-quality proteins and had a surplus of essential amino acids compared with the FAO/WHO/UNU (1985) reference standard. The nutritive value of WPC 80 and its hydrolysates was superior to that of sodium <b>caseinate</b> and its hydrolysates as indicated by some nutritional parameters such as the amino acid composition, chemical score, EAA index and predicted BV. However, the E-PER was lower for the WPC hydrolysates as compared to unhydrolyzed WPC 80 but sodium <b>caseinate</b> and its hydrolysates did not differ significantly. The nutritional qualities of WPC 80, sodium <b>caseinate</b> and their hydrolysates were good and make them appropriate for food formulations or as nutritional supplements...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the amount of protein required to produce amorphous sugar powders through spray-drying. Pea protein isolate {{was used as a}} model plant protein and sodium <b>caseinate</b> was used as a model dairy protein. Powder recovery in a laboratory spray dryer was used as a measure of the ease of spray drying for a given formulation. More than 80 % of amorphous sucrose and fructose was produced with the addition of sodium <b>caseinate,</b> while the pea protein isolate was able to produce only recoveries of less than 50 % of amorphous sucrose. Sensitivity of low molecular weight surfactants has been demonstrated using both ionic (sodium stearoyl lactylate) and non-ionic (polysorbate- 80) surfactants. Spray-dried powders were subjected to physico-chemical characterisation and dissolution experiments. The maximum solubility of all powders was obtained after 5 min of dissolution. The solubility of the sodium <b>caseinate</b> increased by 6 - 7 % in the presence of fructose and low molecular weight surfactants. The solubility of the amorphous powders of sucrose-pea protein isolate was found to be lower than amorphous powders of sucrose-sodium <b>caseinate</b> and fructose-sodium <b>caseinate.</b> The addition of sucrose in water increased the solubility of the pea protein isolate from 16. 84 % to more than 83 %. The non-ionic surfactant (Tween- 80) has reduced the solubility of sucrose-pea protein isolate-Tween- 80 powders significantly (p < 0. 05) compared to those of sucrose-pea protein isolate-sodium stearoyl lactylate powders. The solubility of sucrose-sodium <b>caseinate</b> powders was comparable to that of pure sodium <b>caseinate,</b> indicating that addition of sucrose into 0. 13 % sodium <b>caseinate</b> does not have any significant effect on the solubility of this protein at this concentration...|$|R
40|$|Hydration of Ca and Na <b>caseinates</b> {{which were}} {{prepared}} from whole casein at different pH levels (range 4 · 7 - 8 · 0) {{was determined by}} means of water vapour sorption measurements in the water activity (aw) range 0 · 58 - 0 · 95.

Plots of the water content ν. the amount of added hydroxide at constant aw revealed a linear relationship between water uptake and cation content, suggesting that the increase in water uptake is mainly determined by the amount and type of cations associated with the caseins. In the aw range tested, Ca 2 + adsorbed about 2 - 7 and Na+ 3 - 18 mol water/mol of cation. This implies that replacement of one mol of casein-bound Na+ by Ca 2 + is accompanied by a displacement of 1 - 11 mol water at aw 0 · 58 - 0 · 95. The loss of water is a consequence of conformational changes induced by the chelating and cross-linking effects of Ca 2 +, which also lead to micelle formatio...|$|E

40|$|Rheological {{measurements}} of dense calcium caseinate and sodium caseinate dispersions (15 %) provided {{insight into the}} factors determining shear-induced structure formation in <b>caseinates.</b> Calcium caseinate at a sufficiently high concentration (30 %) was shown to form highly anisotropic structures during shearing and concurrent enzymatic cross-linking. In contrast, sodium caseinate formed isotropic structures using similar processing conditions. The main {{difference between the two}} types of <b>caseinates</b> is the counterion present, and as a consequence, the size of structural elements and their interactions. The rheological behavior of calcium caseinate and sodium caseinate reflected these differences, yielding non-monotonic and shear thinning flow behavior for calcium caseinate whereas sodium caseinate behaved only slightly shear thinning. It appears that the intrinsic properties of the dense caseinate dispersions, which are reflected in their rheological behavior, affect the structure formation that was found after applying shear. Therefore, rheological measurements are useful to obtain an indication of the structure formation potential of caseinate dispersions...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} urea {{addition}} on the self-assembly of <b>caseinate</b> sub-micelles and subsequent {{impact on the}} structural and material properties of <b>caseinate</b> solutions and <b>caseinate</b> stabilised oil-in-water emulsions (30 vol% oil) were studied. Sub-micellar particle size and distribution were measured using dynamic light scattering. Sodium <b>caseinate</b> in solution showed a bimodal particle size distribution centred at 20 and 120 nm (radius). The increasing addition of urea (1. 1 to 6. 6 M) was seen to cause {{a reduction in the}} size of <b>caseinate</b> sub-micelle, which was attributed to a dissociation of the sub-micellar fraction arising from a reduction in hydrophobic interactions. For sodium <b>caseinate</b> solutions above estimated sub-micellar close-packing phase volumes (＞ 10 wt% protein concentration), increasing addition of urea was seen to significantly lower solution viscosity with more pronounced changes observed with increasing protein concentration. All the urea-treated solutions were Newtonian. For sodium <b>caseinate</b> stabilised emulsions, where protein concentrations were above the critical threshold for onset of depletion flocculation, the addition of urea was seen to result in a reduction in depletion free energy of the emulsions. The effects of reduced depletion interaction on emulsion stability, structural and rheological properties were found to be dependent not only on the concentration of added urea, but also on the protein concentration in the emulsions. For 2 and 4 wt% <b>caseinate</b> concentrations, depleted droplets reduced with increasing urea concentration and the emulsion stability increased as well. For 6 wt% protein concentration, the stability decreased with the addition of 1. 1 and 3. 3 M urea, and it was re-established when the urea concentration was up to 6. 6 M. This was attributed to the synergic effects on the depletion potential and continuous phase viscosity which were induced by urea, and it was supported by the results of creaming profiles, rheological properties and microstructure. Likewise, urea had similar effects on the emulsions stabilised by potassium <b>caseinate...</b>|$|R

The influence of the preparation pH and sodium <b>caseinate</b> concentration on capsules physico-chemical properties was investigated. Findings: Results showed that sodium <b>caseinate</b> influenced significantly capsules properties. As regards to the membrane mechanical stability, composite capsules prepared at pH below the isoelectric point of sodium <b>caseinate</b> exhibited the highest surface Young's modulus, increasing with protein content, explained by potential electrostatic interactions between sodium <b>caseinate</b> amino-groups and alginate carboxylic group. The kinetic of cochineal red A release changed significantly for composite capsules and showed a pH-responsive release. Findings: Sodium caseinate-dye mixture studied by absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed complex formation at pH 2 by electrostatic interactions between sodium <b>caseinate</b> tryptophan residues and cochineal red sulfonate-groups. Consequently, the release mechanism was explained by membrane adsorption process.

40|$|The general aim of {{the work}} {{described}} in this thesis was to investigate structure- rheology relations for dairy related products, focusing on model systems containing sodium <b>caseinate.</b> The acid induced gelation of sodium <b>caseinate,</b> of sodium <b>caseinate</b> stabilized emulsions, {{and the effect of}} shear on the structure formation was characterized. Special attention was given to the sol-gel transition point, which was defined by a frequency independent loss tangent. It was shown that the sol-gel transition point is completely controlled by the pH and the temperature, independent of the concentration sodium <b>caseinate</b> or the applied shear rate. Considering sodium <b>caseinate</b> solutions, increase of the temperature of acidification caused a decrease of the critical pH for gelation and a more dense gel structure. The formed gels were not in thermodynamic equilibrium, however, due to the slow kinetics of the system they were stable on the time scale of the experiment. At the gel point we have strong indications that the structure can not be characterized by a single fractal dimension. During the acid induced gelation of sodium <b>caseinate</b> stabilized emulsions a single sol-gel transition was observed. Addition of an excess of sodium <b>caseinate</b> to the emulsion resulted in two sol-gel transitions upon acidification. Application of shear during the acidification of the emulsions showed a decreasing radius of the aggregates formed at the gelpoint with increasing shear rate. The aggregates formed became more dense due to the application of shear while the network that was formed by the aggregates became less compact. No shear induced alignment was observed of emulsion droplets dispersed in water or in a sodium <b>caseinate</b> solution, while emulsion droplets dispersed in a xanthan solution did align in a shear field. Addition of sodium inhibited the string formation of the emulsion droplet...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for digestion {{of a variety}} of solid dairy products (cheeses, <b>caseinates,</b> and milk powders) for subsequent determination of Ca, Mg, Na, and K by flame atomic spectrophotometry. Sample preparation included a microwave digestion system in closed vessels. The procedure has been validated for skim milk powder employing various reaction mixtures that contain HNO 3, HClO 4, and H 2 O 2. Accurate results were achieved for Na and K with mixtures of HNO 3 and H 2 O 2, but values for Ca and Mg were low. Although the results of these elements were improved when HClO 4 was used instead of HNO 3, greatest accuracy was obtained by measurement, using standard addition, of samples digested with mixtures of HNO 3 and H 2 O 2. The assays exhibited varying degrees of precision when used for <b>caseinates</b> and cheese. The coefficients of variation for replicate analyses of <b>caseinates</b> and cheeses were lowest for Mg (1. 34 to 2. 46 %) and Ca (1. 15 to 2. 69 %) and poorest for Na (3. 35 to 9. 02 %).

A mechanistic model based on a pseudo-first-order enzymatic reaction, {{in the presence of}} first-order deactivation of the enzyme, was postulated and successfully fitted to the experimental data. The animal rennet exhibited higher enzymatic efficiency than the fruit extract, irrespective of the source (i. e., bovine, caprine, or ovine) and the type (i. e., RS- or â-casein) of substrate. The enzymatic efficiency (kcat/Km) for RS-casein ranged from 72 to 220 and from 43 to 65 L g- 1 h- 1, and for â-casein from 242 to 742 and from 55 to 164 L g- 1 h- 1, for the animal rennet and the enzymatic extract of O. ficus-indica, respectively.

40|$|The {{effect of}} calcium and sodium {{caseinate}} supplements (2 g/ 100 g) {{on the behavior}} of rice-buckwheat dough and bread quality was compared to the effect of xanthan gum and carboxymethyl cellulose. The addition of <b>caseinates</b> significantly (P < 0. 01) increased dough weakening, which became similar to dough with xanthan gum. During heating, the gelatinization rate became similar to dough with carboxymethyl cellulose. Moreover, peak complex viscosity was decreased by 0. 4. 10 (5) Pa s. Additionally, hydrocolloid supplements impacted bread crumb characteristics. An open structure was found in crumb with added calcium caseinate, carboxymethyl cellulose as well as xanthan gum. The hardness of rice buckwheat crumb without hydrocolloids (12. 2 N) was decreased by calcium caseinate (4. 3 N), xanthan gum (9. 1 N) and carboxymethyl cellulose (9. 3 N), however, no significant effect of sodium caseinate was recorded (11. 5 N). The overall sensory acceptability of rice-buckwheat bread (7. 1) was increased by sodium caseinate (7. 5), calcium caseinate (7. 7) and carboxymethyl cellulose (7. 8). The acceptability of bread with xanthan gum (5. 9) was negatively impacted by dry, coarse crust and extremely sticky crumb. It can be concluded <b>caseinates</b> may be alternative substances with satisfactory impact on the rheological characteristics of rice -buckwheat dough, as well as bread quality.

The logarithm of apparent viscosity of sodium <b>caseinate</b> solutions increased linearly with increases in added ionic strength (AIS) at both 25 °C and 50 °C. Linear regression models {{were calculated for}} each monovalent salt. The slope of the regression models for each salt, at a given temperature, followed the Hofmeister series. The increase in apparent viscosity between 0 and 0. 2 AIS was proportionately larger than all increases caused by further salt additions. The apparent viscosity of sodium <b>caseinate</b> solutions increased with divalent salt concentration until a maximum was reached. Increasing the salt concentration above that necessary for maximum apparent viscosity resulted in a decrease in apparent viscosity followed by precipitation. The apparent viscosity of a given solution with or without added divalent salt was {{an order of magnitude}} lower at 50 °C than at 25 °C.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{functional}} proteins {{was not born}} until the 1950 s and, initially, the only commercially-produced functional proteins were merely dried fresh foods, for example dried egg white and non-fat dried milk. These products were similar to their fresh counterparts and no attempt was made in food industry to purify or fractionate proteins. The use of purified proteins was first achieved in other industries. For example, casein had been produced for many years piror to its isolation for food usage for plastic production and paper coating. The production of functional proteins accelerated in 1960 s with the production of soya isolate and sodium caseinate.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of added CaCl 2 on (i) the adsorption behaviour of <b>caseinate</b> and whey protein concentrate (WPC) at the oil-water interfaces and (ii) the stability of emulsions formed with <b>caseinate</b> or WPC. The relationship between aggregation state of protein, due to Ca 2 + binding, and emulsifying properties is discussed. The effects of addition of NaCl to the emulsions containing various concentrations of CaCl 2 were also explored. Protein solutions and 30 % soya oil, at pH 7. 0, were mixed and homogenized at 207 / 34 bar and 55 °C to form emulsions. CaCl 2 was added to protein solutions prior to emulsion formation or to the emulsions after they were made. The average particle size (d 32 or d 43), the surface protein concentration, the composition of protein adsorbed layer at the interface and the creaming stability of emulsions were determined. The microstructure of emulsions was observed using the confocal laser microscopy. The droplet sizes of emulsions made with sodium <b>caseinate</b> or WPC were similar and were independent of the protein concentration at concentration above 0. 5 %. The surface protein concentration of emulsions made with sodium <b>caseinate,</b> WPC or calcium <b>caseinate</b> generally increased with increase in the protein concentration, although the trends were different. The emulsions made with calcium <b>caseinate</b> had higher (d 32 and surface protein concentration than that of sodium <b>caseinate</b> or WPC. In emulsions made with sodium <b>caseinate</b> at low protein concentrations, the adsorption of β-casein occurred in preference to αs -casein, whereas αs- (αs 1 - + αs 2 -) casein was found to adsorb in preference to β-casein at high protein concentrations. In calcium <b>caseinate</b> emulsions, the αs -casein was adsorbed in preference to β-casein at all concentrations. In emulsions made with WPC, β-lactoglobulin adsorbed slightly in preference to α-lactalbumin. In emulsions made with mixtures of sodium <b>caseinate</b> and WPC (1 : 1), the adsorption of whey proteins occurred in preference to caseins at low concentrations (< 3 %), whereas caseins were adsorbed in preference to whey protein at high concentrations. In emulsions made with calcium <b>caseinate</b> or WPC, the creaming stability of emulsions followed mainly the changes in particle size of emulsions. However, the creaming stability of emulsions made with sodium <b>caseinate</b> decreased markedly as the <b>caseinate</b> concentrations were increased above 2. 0 %. This was attributed to depletion flocculation occurring in these emulsions. Whey proteins did not retard this instability, due to depletion flocculation, in emulsions made with mixtures of <b>caseinate</b> and WPC When CaCl 2 was added prior to or after emulsion formation, the (d 43 and surface protein concentration increased with increasing CaCl 2 concentration in emulsions made with 0. 5 and 3. 0 % sodium <b>caseinate.</b> The adsorption of αs -casein increased with increase in the concentration of CaCl 2, with a corresponding decrease in the adsorption of β-casein. The creaming stability of emulsions made with 0. 5 % <b>caseinate</b> decreased with increasing CaCl 2 concentration. However, the creaming stability increased with CaCl 2 concentration in 3. 0 % <b>caseinate</b> emulsion. The destabilising effects of CaCl 2 in emulsions made with sodium <b>caseinate</b> were reduced by the addition of 200 mM NaCl. Addition of CaCl 2 to protein solutions prior to emulsion formation increased the d 43 and surface protein concentration in emulsions made with 0. 5 or 3. 0 % WPC. In this case, the adsorption of β-lactoglobulin occurred slightly in preference to α-lactalbumin. The creaming stability of emulsions decreased with increase in the concentration of CaCl 2. The addition of CaCl 2 to emulsions after emulsion formation also resulted in increases in and surface protein concentration of emulsions made with 0. 5 % WPC and formation of gel-like network structure at high CaCl 2 concentrations. However, the stability of emulsion made with 3. 0 % WPC was not affected by the addition of CaCl 2. Different aggregation mechanisms are involved depending upon whether Ca 2 + is added to protein solution before emulsification or to the emulsion after its formation. Addition of Ca 2 + to protein solution may lead to decrease in emulsifying capacity and subsequently result in protein bridging flocculation between emulsion droplets. Ca 2 + bridging flocculation between emulsion droplets may be formed in emulsions that have Ca 2 + added. The change in aggregation state of <b>caseinate</b> due to Ca 2 + binding could retard the instability of emulsion due to depletion flocculation. The protein unfolding at the surface of emulsions made with low whey protein concentrations may promote the protein-Ca-protein bridges forming between protein-coated emulsion droplets, consequently forming gel-like network structure in emulsions...|$|R

40|$|In the Iberian Peninsula, the proteinases {{present in}} the flowers {{of members of the}} Cynara genus, C. cardunculus, C. humilis and C. scolymus, have for many years been {{successfully}} used in the manufacture of traditional cheeses from ovine and/or caprine milk on individual farms (Vieira de Sá & Barbosa, 1972; Trujillo et al. 1994). In Portugal, C. cardunculus is the species most frequently employed. Although commercial thistle was tentatively assumed to be pure in taxonomic terms, accurate analyses have shown that the flowers of C. cardunculus are often mixed with flowers of C. humilis (Pires et al. 1994). The clotting activity of C. humilis is due to an aspartic proteinase, currently designated cardosin A and similar to another enzyme obtained from C. cardunculus. This enzyme is similar in specificity and activity to chymosin (Pires et al. 1994). The action of cardosin A from C. cardunculus upon ovine and caprine caseins has been reported recently (Ramalho-Santos et al. 1996; Simo 4 es, 1998; Sousa & Malcata, 1998), but as yet there is no information on the proteolytic activity of the proteinase from C. humilis upon caseins from milks other than bovine. Caseins from small ruminants' milks are the usual substrates of cardosin during milk coagulation and cheese ripening, and sodium caseinate represents an intermediate system between isolated caseins and the cheese matrix that is free from interference by fat. Thus ovine and caprine <b>caseinates</b> may be useful substrates for investigating the proteolytic activity of cardosin.

Mostly microencapsulated foods or food contstituents are solid and liquid fats, aroma components, vitamins, minerals, coloring compounds and enzymes. Capsulating materials mostly used are starch, maltodextrin, pullulan, sucrose, maltose in carbohydrate structure; gelatin, whey proteins, casein and <b>caseinates</b> in protein structure and some gams like gam arabic. This review cover the subjects about microencapsulation technology, the capsulating materials and their use in food industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{protectant}} solids (lactose, sodium <b>caseinate,</b> and their mixture) on {{the survival of}} Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris was studied in a convective-air-drying environment using single droplet drying. The effect of drying the bacteria in {{the presence or absence}} of sodium ascorbate was evaluated, and the evolution of glass transition temperature in the drying process was examined. It was found that the protective efficiency of lactose and sodium <b>caseinate</b> was comparable at the concentrations tested. A mixed protectant matrix (lactose:sodium <b>caseinate,</b> 3 : 1) gave higher survival than with lactose or sodium <b>caseinate</b> alone at the same total solids level. Protectants enhanced bacterial survival by moderating the drying rate and achieving dryness at lower temperatures, and by facilitating the formation of a glassy matrix earlier in the drying process. The addition of sodium ascorbate was also examined...|$|R
40|$|Application {{of sodium}} <b>caseinate</b> as a {{functional}} additive in manufacturing processes requires production of its concentrated aqueous solutions which, in industrial conditions, presents {{a number of}} difficulties. In order to develop an effective and optimal industrial process of mixing – manufacturing a concentrated solution of sodium <b>caseinate,</b> {{it is essential to}} know rheological properties in a definite range of concentrations changing {{in the course of the}} dissolving process. The material for investigations was typical commercial sodium <b>caseinate</b> in the form of dry powder manufactured in Poland from acid casein using the method of extrusion. The objective of the undertaken empirical studies was the assessment of the impact of the concentration on rheological properties of sodium <b>caseinate</b> concentrates. Investigations were carried out for five concentrates manufactured in a mixer equipped in a mechanical agitator at concentrations ranging X (%) Î (2. 5 ¸ 12. 5) and changing mass proportions of sodium <b>caseinate</b> in the aqueous solution as follows: GS/G (kgS·kg- 1) = 0. 025. On the basis of the obtained research results, classical flow curves were plotted for individual concentrates. The determined values of viscosity and density of the examined solutions were correlated in the form of h = f(GS/G) and r = f(GS/G) dependencies which were used during the determination of classical characteristics of mixing forces essential for the assessment of energetic expenditures required to manufacture concentrates in a mixer equipped in a mechanical agitator. The density of the examined concentrates increased in a way directly proportional, while the dynamic viscosity coefficient increased exponentially together with the increase of sodium <b>caseinate</b> concentration. Sodium <b>caseinate</b> concentrates exhibited Newtonian character in the examined range of concentrations...|$|R

40|$|Two {{commercial}} lots {{of calcium}} caseinate preparations differing in performance imitation cheese were analyzed for various characteristics. A imitation process cheese manufacturing classified the <b>caseinates</b> {{as good or}} poor based on appearances of the finished cheese, emulsification of fat, oiling-off during sheeting and melting properties. The sample which exhibited good functional properties in imitation cheese, had slightly higher calcium (16. 4 mg/g protein), non-casein protein (2. 87 %) and y-casein contents, a higher formal titre (8. 95 mg free amino N/g protein), lower water absorption (138 mg/ 100 g protein), and lower stability to added calcium (8. 0 min) than did the other sample (14. 6 mg/g, 1. 66 %, 8. 02 mg/g, 129 mg/ 100 g, and 15 min, respectively), which was described as having poor functionality according to the criteria of the imitation cheese producer...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project {{was to investigate the}} effects of key processing steps in the industrial production of acid casein on the characteristics and functionality of sodium caseinate with particular emphasis on analytical/functionality testing and seasonal/lactational effects on the original milk. The main conclusions were as follows: The most significant result indicates that drying and concentration after washing of the acid casein curd are responsible for alterations in the structure of casein, which result in sodium <b>caseinates</b> with different properties. This was confirmed in the case of two acid casein plants investigated which showed similar results even though using different washing and drying technologies. This difference due to the drying step may be further amplified depending upon whether commercial sodium caseinate is manufactured from acid casein in the dried or wet curd state. The analytical and functional testing methodology adapted in our laboratory proved effective in predicting the effects of processing steps on the functionality of sodium caseinate. In particular, the ability to detect the presence of aggregate formation was particularly important. The database generated subsequently helped an acid casein manufacturer in modifying its process(es) to manufacture experimental sodium caseinate for specific food end-uses. Progress was greatly facilitated by the collaboration of individual manufacturers in the sourcing of problem samples from previously manufactured codes, and facilitating access to process plant during production. In a commercial application of the database, confidential work was undertaken on behalf of a client. Experimentally-produced sodium caseinate ingredients were evaluated using our adapted functionality testing methods and based on the results, the company was able to modify its process(es) to produce sodium <b>caseinates</b> with functionality for specific food end-users. It was concluded that while processing parameters in the production of acid casein can {{have a significant effect on}} the functional behaviour of the resultant sodium caseinate, the ability to assess this change in functional behaviour, through relevant functional testing, was equally important.

40|$|Edible films {{present a}} {{potential}} alternative for replacing plastic films used for packaging in food industry. One {{of the major}} advantages is the environmental appeal of this technology, which produces no packaging waste. Some films made with other edible materials have found commercial applications, and many more are being developed using a myriad of food based components. This paper focuses on some important characteristics of films produced with sodium and calcium <b>caseinates.</b> The effects of caseinate type and concentration, plasticizer concentration and pH were studied. Major parameters investigated were solubility, tensile properties, water vapour and oxygen permeabilities. Caseinate films showed high solubility at pH range 6. 0 - 8. 0 and complete insolubility at pH 3. 0 and 4. 0. Calcium caseinate films had a higher tensile strength and a lower % elongation at break than sodium caseinate films. There was not significant difference in water vapour and oxygen permeabilities between sodium and calcium caseinate films...|$|E
40|$|The optimum {{conditions}} {{for the production of}} coprecipitate from sheep milk were studied. The best percentage of calcium chloride added to milk was 0. 2 %, which resulted in a recovery of 97. 5 % of milk proteins. At low pH (4. 5 – 5), the recovery of protein was low, but it increased at higher pH values (5. 5 – 6. 5); recovery was greatest at pH 6. 5. The optimum heating temperature to obtain coprecipitate from sheep milk was 85 – 95 °C. The functional properties of the sheep milk coprecipitate were studied. At pH values higher than 6, there were no differences between the solubility of sheep milk coprecipitate and sheep milk sodium <b>caseinate,</b> but the solubility of coprecipitate at pH values lower than 5 was relatively higher than those of the <b>caseinate.</b> At pH ≥ 6, the emulsion activity index (EAI) for emulsions of sheep milk coprecipitate and <b>caseinate</b> increased as pH increased; at all pH values, the EAI of the coprecipitate was higher than that of the <b>caseinate.</b> Sheep milk coprecipitate showed higher foaming ability and stability than sheep milk sodium <b>caseinate...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe surface {{compositions}} of food powders {{created from}} spray drying solutions containing various ratios of sodium <b>caseinate,</b> maltodextrin and soya oil have been analysed by Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis. The results show significant enrichment of oil {{at the surface}} of particles compared to the bulk phase and, when the non-oil components only are considered, a significant surface enrichment of sodium <b>caseinate</b> also. The degree of surface enrichment of both oil and sodium <b>caseinate</b> was found to increase with decreasing bulk levels of the respective components. Surface enrichment of oil was also affected by processing conditions (emulsion drop size and drying temperature), but surface enrichment of sodium <b>caseinate</b> was relatively insensitive to these. The presence of “pock marks” on the particle surfaces strongly suggests that the surface oil was caused by rupturing of emulsion droplets at the surface as the surrounding matrix contracts and hardens...|$|R
