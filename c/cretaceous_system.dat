25|$|Inspired by Mary Anning's sensational {{discovery}} of a fossilised animal resembling a huge crocodile (later identified as an ichthyosaur) at Lyme Regis in Dorset, Mantell became passionately interested {{in the study of}} the fossilised animals and plants found in his area. The fossils he had collected from the region, near The Weald in Sussex, were from the chalk downlands covering the county. The chalk is part of the Upper <b>Cretaceous</b> <b>System</b> and the fossils it contains are marine in origin. But by 1819, Mantell had begun acquiring fossils from a quarry, at Whitemans Green, near Cuckfield. These included the remains of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, at a time when all the known fossil remains from Cretaceous England, hitherto, were marine in origin. He named the new strata the Strata of Tilgate Forest, after an historical wooded area and it was later shown to belong to the Lower Cretaceous.|$|E

Drawing {{the boundary between the}} Jurassic and <b>Cretaceous</b> <b>systems</b> is a matter of global scale discussions. The problem of proposing possible J/K boundary stratotypes results from lack of a global index fossils, global sea level drop, paleogeographic changes causing development of isolated facies areas, {{as well as from the}} effect of Late Cimmerian Orogeny.

6000|$|Some of the {{fragments}} of Ammonites were as thick as a man's arm: the Gryphaea is much the most abundant shell. These fossils M. d'Orbigny considers as belonging to the Neocomian stage of the <b>Cretaceous</b> <b>system.</b> Dr. Meyen, who ascended {{the valley of the}} Rio Volcan, a branch of the Yeso, found a nearly similar, but apparently more calcareous formation, with much gypsum, and no doubt the equivalent of that here described ("Reise um Erde" [...] etc. Th. 1 s. 355.): the beds were vertical, and were prolonged up to the limits of perpetual snow; at the height of 9,000 feet above the sea, they abounded with fossils, consisting, according to Von Buch ("Descript.

60|$|This latter species we {{have seen}} {{associated}} with the fossils of which lists have been given in this chapter, in two places in the valley of Coquimbo, and in the ravine of Maricongo at Copiapo. Considering this fact, and the superposition of these beds on the porphyritic conglomerate formation; and, as we shall immediately see, from their containing much gypsum, and from their otherwise close general resemblance in mineralogical nature with the strata described in the valley of Copiapo, I have little doubt that these fossiliferous beds of Iquique belong to the great cretaceo-oolitic formation of Northern Chile. Iquique is situated seven degrees latitude north of Copiapo; and I may here mention, that an Ammonites, nov. species, and an Astarte, nov. species, were given me from the Cerro Pasco, about ten degrees of latitude north of Iquique, and M. D'Orbigny thinks that they probably indicate a Neocomian formation. Again, fifteen degrees of latitude northward, in Colombia, there is a grand fossiliferous deposit, now well known from the labours of Von Buch, Lea, d'Orbigny, and Forbes, which belongs to the earlier stages of the <b>cretaceous</b> <b>system.</b> Hence, bearing in mind {{the character of the}} few fossils from Tierra del Fuego, {{there is some evidence that}} a great portion of the stratified deposits of the whole vast range of the South American Cordillera belongs to about the same geological epoch.|$|E
60|$|When on the Pampas {{and looking}} southward, and whilst {{travelling}} northward, I could see for very many leagues the red granite and dark mica-schist forming the crest and eastern {{flank of the}} Portillo line. This great range, according to Dr. Gillies, can be traced with little interruption for 140 miles southward to the R. Diamante, where it unites with the western ranges: northward, according to this same author, it terminates where the R. Mendoza debouches from the mountains; but a little further north {{in the eastern part}} of the Cumbre section, there are, as we shall hereafter see, some mountain-masses of a brick-red porphyry, the last injected amidst many other porphyries, and having so close an analogy with the coarse red granite of the Portillo line, that I am tempted to believe that they belong to the same axis of injection; if so, the Portillo line is at least 200 miles in length. Its height, even in the lowest gap in the road, is 14,365 feet, and some of the pinnacles apparently attain an elevation of about 16,000 feet above the sea. The geological history of this grand chain appears to me eminently interesting. We may safely conclude, that at a former period the valley of Tenuyan existed as an arm of the sea, about twenty-miles in width, bordered on one hand by a ridge or chain of islets of the black calcareous shales and purple sandstones of the gypseous formation; and on the other hand, by a ridge or chain of islets composed of mica-slate, white granite, and perhaps to a partial extent of red granite. These two chains, whilst thus bordering the old sea-channel, must have been exposed for a vast lapse of time to alluvial and littoral action, during which the rocks were shattered, the fragments rounded, and the strata of conglomerate accumulated to a thickness of at least fifteen hundred or two thousand feet. The red orthitic granite now forms, as we have seen, the main part of the Portillo chain: it is injected in dikes not only into the mica-schist and white granites, but into the laminated sandstone, which it has metamorphosed, and which it has thrown off, together with the conformably overlying coloured beds and stratified conglomerate, at an angle of forty-five degrees. To have thrown off so vast a pile of strata at this angle, is a proof that the main part of the red granite (whether or not portions, as perhaps is probable, previously existed) was injected in a liquified state after the accumulation both of the laminated sandstone and of the conglomerate; this conglomerate, we know, was accumulated, not only after the deposition of the fossiliferous strata of the Peuquenes line, but after their elevation and long-continued denudation: and these fossiliferous strata belong to the early part of the <b>Cretaceous</b> <b>system.</b> Late, therefore, in a geological sense, as must be the age of the main part of the red granite, I can conceive nothing more impressive than the eastern view of this great range, as forcing the mind to grapple with the idea of the thousands of thousands of years requisite for the denudation of the strata which originally encased it,--for that the fluidified granite was once encased, its mineralogical composition and structure, and the bold conical shape of the mountain-masses, yield sufficient evidence. Of the encasing strata we see the last vestiges in the coloured beds on the crest, in the little caps of mica-schist on some of the loftiest pinnacles, and in the isolated patches of this same rock at corresponding heights on the now bare and steep flanks.|$|E

The succession is exposed in one of the allochthonous units of the Tauride Belt, the Aladag Unit, whose stratigraphy includes beds ranging from the Devonian to the <b>Cretaceous</b> <b>systems.</b> In the Aladag Unit, the Permian-Triassic boundary beds are entirely composed of carbonates. The Permian portion of these beds belongs to the Paradagmarita Zone, whereas the lowermost Triassic contains the Lower Griesbachian marker Rectocornuspira kalhori.

Cyclic Upper Permian carbonates are interpreted as highstand sytems tract deposits of the last third-order sequence of the Permian System. The Permian-Triassic boundary is an unconformity corresponding to both erosional and non-depositional hiatuses.

40|$|In Japan and Korea, some Lower Cretaceous terrigenous clastic rocks yield {{detrital}} chromian spinels. These chromian spinels {{are divided}} into two groups: low-Ti and high-Ti. The Sanchu Group and the Yuno Formation in Japan have both groups, whereas the Nagashiba Formation in Japan and the Jinju Formation in Korea have only the low-Ti spinels. High-Ti spinels {{are thought to have}} originated in intraplate-type basalt. Low-Ti spinels (higher than 0. 6 Cr) were probably derived from peridotites, which are highly correlated with an arc setting derivation and possibly with a forearc setting derivation. Low-Ti spinels are seen in the Sanchu Group, the Nagashiba Formation and the Jinju Formation. Low-Ti spinels from the Yuno Formation are characterized by low Cr (less than 0. 6) and these chromian spinels appear to have been derived from oceanic mantle-type peridotite, including backarc. According to maps reconstructing the pre-Sea of Japan configuration of the Japanese Islands and the Korean Peninsula, the Korean Cretaceous basin was comparatively close to the Southwest Japan depositional basins. It is possible that these Lower <b>Cretaceous</b> <b>systems</b> were sediments mainly in the forearc and partly in the backarc regions.

50|$|At any location, rock {{sections}} {{in a given}} system are apt to contain gaps (unconformities) analogous to missing pages from a book.

However, the time interval of the Cretaceous (Cretaceous Period) still occurred there. Thus, a geologic period represents the time interval over which the strata of a system were deposited, including any unknown amounts of time present in gaps. Periods are measured in years, determined by radioactive dating. On Mars, radiometric ages are not available except from Martian meteorites whose provenance and stratigraphic context are unknown. Instead, absolute ages on Mars are determined by impact crater density, which is heavily dependent upon models of crater formation over time. Accordingly, the beginning and end dates for Martian periods are uncertain, especially for the Hesperian/Amazonian boundary, which may be in error by a factor of 2 or 3.|$|E

This zonation is most clearly expressed by a west-to-east variation from mafic to felsic plutonic assemblages. South of 35. 5 °N, the depth of exposure increases markedly, and fragments of shallow-level eastern Sierra Nevada batholith affinity rocks overlie deeper-level western zone rocks and subjacent subduction accretion assemblages along a major Late <b>Cretaceous</b> detachment <b>system.</b> The magnitude of displacement along this detachment system is assessed here by palinspastic reconstruction of vertical piercing points provided by batholithic and metamorphic pendant structure and stratigraphy.

Rudist bivalves became the dominant lithogenetic taxon owing to their proliferation in shallow-water environments and strong dominance of Late Cretaceous carbonate factories. Their inception, evolution, and demise were seemingly controlled by a complex interplay of environmental processes that, acting on a global scale, profoundly modified the Early <b>Cretaceous</b> hydrosphere–atmosphere <b>system</b> and forced Tethyan depositional systems to change their organization, internal architecture, and facies patterns. As a result, wide, open shelves developed where the almost ubiquitous mode of carbonate fixation was that of foramol factories. In this paper, evidence of the remarkable regional variability in the rudist-bearing carbonate platforms of the Mediterranean Tethys is presented. The analysis of the resulting shallow-water facies has demonstrated that, in spite of several stratigraphic similarities and common sedimentological features, some remarkable differences occurred between the northern Tethyan margin and the central Tethyan banks as regards the areal partitioning of the main paleoecologic controlling factors. This resulted in the deposition of rhodalgal successions in Sardinia (northern Tethyan margin) and rudist-rich foramol facies in the Apennine–Apulia (central Tethys) regions, respectively. Such Late <b>Cretaceous</b> carbonate <b>systems</b> can be viewed as geological products which have closely and coherently recorded the globally changing environmental conditions of the oceanic realm.

Modern Lake Turkana has a record stretching back more than 200 thousand years, with earlier lake phases throughout the Plio-Pleistocene. The geologic history of the basin is one of dynamic landscapes responding to environmental influences, including tectonics, volcanic activity and climate. The Turkana Basin is a hydro-graphic and sedimentary syste...|$|R
