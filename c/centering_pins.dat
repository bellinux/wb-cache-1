50|$|Tatrapan is an {{armoured}} {{off-road vehicle}} {{built on the}} military version of the Tatra 815 chassis. The vehicle has a cab for a driver and a commander of the vehicle and a superstructure body which can be modified and equipped for various applications. The superstructure body is designed as an autonomous unit and its crew can work independently also as a permanent autonomous station. Quick release clamps with <b>centering</b> <b>pins</b> provide a means for fastening the body, thus enabling application of various bodies on a single chassis. Maximum time required to replace a body is 60 minutes.|$|E
40|$|EP 1473131 A UPAB: 20041208 NOVELTY - Numbers of {{individual}} textile blanks (4) are assembled in a compaction stage. A highly-compact component (5) is produced, in a shape {{close to its}} final form. This is saturated with an adhesive resin. It is hardened at raised temperature under increased pressure. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Numbers {{of individual}} textile blanks (4) are assembled in a compaction stage. A highly-compact component (5) is produced, in a shape close to its final form. This is saturated with an adhesive resin. It is hardened at raised temperature under increased pressure. The blanks are matched {{with each other and}} for the final product geometry. A mold (1) is employed for vacuum compaction, which is carried out in a heating oven or other heating unit. Upper and lower mold dies (2, 3) are used, arranging the preforms between them. Their molding faces (6, 7) match the final geometry of the component produced. <b>Centering</b> <b>pins</b> (8) are included between these faces. All parts of the compaction mold are placed inside a vacuum bag (9). Application of reduced pressure applies pressure to the mold halves. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the corresponding molding equipment. USE - To make e. g. fiber-reinforced plastic window frame composite preforms for aircraft from textile blanks. ADVANTAGE - The quality of the e. g. fiber-reinforced window frame produced for passenger aircraft, is sufficient to replace a forged aluminum frame previously employed. Vacuum assisted compaction may if necessary, be supplemented by application of force from flexible pressure tubes...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 This paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} two-phase gas-liquid vertical annular climbing film flow. Using a high speed Fastax movie camera, motion was slowed sufficiently to facilitate {{detailed analysis of the}} climbing film structure, based on single frame projections. The dynamic characteristics of the liquid film could likewise be obtained, though these were necessarily of a qualitative nature, A technique based on a diffusion controlled electrochemical reaction was employed to monitor the local instantaneous mass transfer coefficient at the solid-liquid interface. The resultant fluctuating electrical signal was amplified and presented for direct comparison with the climbing film structure, using split image photography. The signal was also subjected to a spectral density analysis to further {{understanding of the nature of}} the turbulence produced at the interface. The vertical annular column was constructed of a three-inch inside diameter clear plexiglass tube, with a one-inch outside diameter concentric core, supported laterally by a series of streamlined <b>centering</b> <b>pins.</b> The column extended some 35 feet from the base with all tests carried out approximately midway up the column to minimize end effects. The particular construction of the column permitted an unobstructed view of the free surface of the climbing film. Determination of the pressure gradients was likewise simplified as the inner surface of the outer tube remained essentially dry throughout the experimental program. The air flow rates varied from 172 cfm to 616 cfm at one atmosphere pressure and 68 °F, temperature. Liquid flow rates were confined to a range from. 19 lbm/min to 1. 5 lbm/min so as to stay within the climbing film regime. From the movie film analysis, values for the average film thickness, wave frequency and phase velocity were determined with their respective standard deviations. Two empirical models have been proposed which fit the average film thickness data to within 6...|$|E

50|$|Studded {{tires are}} also used on bicycles, and the grip {{advantage}} on ice {{is similar to that}} from using traction sand, with the difference that there is no risk of blank spots when using studded tires. Quality tire manufacturers use studs with hard <b>center</b> <b>pins</b> also for bicycle tires, and just like their automobile counterparts, those studs will continue to protrude from the tire even after many years of usage on bare pavement. There are also low-quality studded bicycle tires being sold that have studs that lack the hard-metal <b>center</b> <b>pin</b> (there is still a <b>center</b> <b>pin,</b> but it is not made of hard metal).
