40|$|Introduction:? Functioning is {{increasingly}} being {{taken into account}} when assessing the impact of bipolar disorder (BD) on the individual, {{as well as the}} effectiveness of treatments. With the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), we can now rely on a globally agreed-upon framework and system for classifying the typical spectrum of problems in functioning, given the environmental context in which subjects live. ICF <b>Core</b> <b>Sets</b> are subgroups of ICF items selected to capture those aspects of functioning that {{are most likely to be}} affected by specific disorders. Within a given disorder, both Brief and Comprehensive <b>Core</b> <b>Sets</b> can be established to serve specific purposes. Objective:? The aim of this paper is to outline the development process of the ICF <b>Core</b> <b>Sets</b> for BD. Methods:? The final definition of ICF <b>Core</b> <b>Sets</b> for BD will be determined at an ICF Core-Sets Consensus Conference, which will integrate evidence from preliminary studies, namely (a) semi-structured interviews with people with BD in different countries, (b) a Delphi exercise with international experts participating and (c) a cross-sectional study. Conclusion:? ICF <b>Core</b> <b>Sets</b> are being designed with the goal of providing useful standards for research, clinical practice and teaching. We believe that these ICF <b>Core</b> <b>Sets</b> for BD will stimulate research leading to improved understanding of functioning, disability and health in BD. Such research, we hope, will lead to interventions and accommodations to improve restoration and maintenance of functioning and minimise disability among people with BD throughout the world...|$|R
40|$|Study design: Psychometric study {{analyzing}} {{the data of}} a cross-sectional, multicentric study with 1048 persons {{with spinal cord injury}} (SCI). Objective: To shed light on how to apply the Brief <b>Core</b> <b>Sets</b> for SCI of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) by determining whether the ICF categories contained in the <b>Core</b> <b>Sets</b> capture differences in overall health. Methods: Lasso regression was applied using overall health, rated by the patients and health professionals, as dependent variables and the ICF categories of the Comprehensive ICF <b>Core</b> <b>Sets</b> for SCI as independent variables. Results: The ICF categories that best capture differences in overall health refer to areas of life such as self-care, relationships, economic self-sufficiency and community life. Only about 25 % of the ICF categories of the Brief ICF <b>Core</b> <b>Sets</b> for the early post-acute and for long-term contexts were selected in the Lasso regression and differentiate, therefore, among levels of overall health. Conclusion: ICF categories such as d 570 Looking after one's health, d 870 Economic self-sufficiency, d 620 Acquisition of goods and services and d 910 Community life, which capture changes in overall health in patients with SCI, should be considered in addition to those of the Brief ICF <b>Core</b> <b>Sets</b> in clinical and epidemiological studies in persons with SCI...|$|R
40|$|Amputation is {{a common}} late stage sequel of {{peripheral}} vascular disease and diabetes or a sequel of accidental trauma, civil unrest and landmines. The functional impairments affect many facets of life including but not limited to: Mobility; activities of daily living; body image and sexuality. Classification, measurement and comparison {{of the consequences of}} amputations has been impeded by the limited availability of internationally, multiculturally standardized instruments in the amputee setting. The introduction of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) by the World Health Assembly in May 2001 provides a globally accepted framework and classification system to describe, assess and compare function and disability. In order to facilitate the use of the ICF in everyday clinical practice and research, ICF <b>core</b> <b>sets</b> have been developed that focus on specific aspects of function typically associated with a particular disability. The objective {{of this paper is to}} outline the development process for the ICF <b>core</b> <b>sets</b> for persons following amputation. The ICF <b>core</b> <b>sets</b> are designed to translate the benefits of the ICF into clinical routine. The ICF <b>core</b> <b>sets</b> will be defined at a Consensus conference which will integrate evidence from preparatory studies, namely: (a) a systematic literature review regarding the outcome measures of clinical trails and observational studies, (b) semi-structured patient interviews, (c) international experts participating in an internet-based survey, and (d) cross-sectional, multi-center studies for clinical applicability.

5000|$|Early in {{the history}} of Magic, the sets sold out nearly instantaneously, and {{supplying}} the game's growing fan base proved tricky. Sales were also concentrated on the West Coast of the United States, where Wizards of the Coast was based. The earliest base sets—Unlimited, Revised, and Fourth Edition—helped provide the first experience with Magic for many players in areas where Magic had never been sold before, enabling them to catch up on the base game with cards that, while technically reprints, had never been available to them before. As the market became saturated, the base sets took on a changed role; they began to be marketed as the entry point for new Magic players, with less interest expected from dedicated Magic players who likely owned many of the cards already. Seventh Edition, released in 2001, was sold both as a [...] "Basic" [...] and an [...] "Advanced" [...] product, with the expansion sets of the time marked as [...] "Expert."
