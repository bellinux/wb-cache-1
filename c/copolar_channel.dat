40|$|Abstract—We apply, for {{the first}} time, an equal-scattering-mechanism multibaseline {{optimization}} technique on quad-pol satellite images of RADARSAT- 2 {{in order to increase}} the inter-ferometric coherence. The optimized polarimetric channel results in the selection of new pixel candidates for multibaseline differen-tial interferometric synthetic aperture radar applications, which, otherwise, are not recognized in any single-pol channel. In ad-dition, we analyze the individual performance of this algorithm for rural and urban land covers along with the corresponding optimized scattering mechanisms. The optimized coherence im-provement with respect to a single HH channel is shown to be correlated with the interferometric spatial and temporal baselines. Finally, we investigate the performance of this technique on the interferometric phase. The optimized interferograms increase the quality of the phase patterns with respect to those phases recov-ered in a single <b>copolar</b> <b>channel,</b> e. g., the residual orbital ramps of the RADARSAT- 2 images.

40|$|Three {{time series}} of dual-pol TerraSAR-X images have been {{acquired}} {{during the whole}} cultivation period for a rice site in Spain. Among different observations, the backscattering at HH and VV channels, and the HH/VV ratio at 30 degrees incidence has shown a temporal signature with a clear correlation {{with the development of}} plants during the vegetative and reproductive phenological phases. A physical interpretation has been provided for this response. Results provided by the dual-pol entropy-alpha decomposition and by the phase difference between <b>copolar</b> <b>channels</b> have been also introduced and preliminarily discussed. In addition, these images have demonstrated to be useful for discriminating rice fields from other types and also for detecting areas with irrigation problems inside the rice field...|$|R

40|$|Mathematical {{expressions}} for the interferometric {{coherence of}} homogeneous-volume-over-ground models (RVoG and OVoG) {{for the case}} of dominant specular scattering and considering a single-tx interferometer are derived. The analysis of {{the positions of the}} coherences on the complex plane, {{as a function of the}} polarization channel, yields important differences for the single-tx and the alternate-tx acquisition modes when the ground return is dominated by the double-bounce contributions. An additional volume decorrelation term appears when the interferometer is operated in a single-tx mode. This feature makes more difficult the parameter inversion from PolInSAR observables, since the topographic phase is not represented anymore by the crossing between the line formed by the coherences and the unit circumference. The effect of this bistatic volume decorrelation is even more noticeable for the cross-polar channel in the oriented volume case, since the phase of the coherence with an infinite ground-to-volume ratio does not correspond to the topographic phase, as observed for the <b>copolar</b> <b>channels.</b> Additionally, a preliminary study of the influence of the bistatic volume decorrelation as a function of the bistatic angle has been carried out. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{coherent}} {{nature of}} the acquisition by TerraSAR-X of both <b>copolar</b> <b>channels</b> (HH and VV) enables the generation of many different polarimetric observables with physical interpretation, as have recently been used for monitoring rice fields. In this letter, the influence of incidence angle upon these polarimetric observables is analyzed by comparing three stacks of images that were acquired simultaneously at different incidence angles (22 °, 30 °, and 40 °) during a whole cultivation campaign. We show that the response of observables related to dominance (entropy, ratios of components) and type of scattering mechanisms (alpha angles) is not greatly influenced by incidence angle at some stages: early and advanced vegetative phases, and maturation. Moreover, the acquisition geometry drives the sensitivity {{to the presence of}} the initial stems and tillers, being detected earlier at shallower angles. This analysis is a necessary step before studying potential methodologies for combining different orbits and beams for reducing the time between acquisitions for monitoring purposes.

40|$|Typically {{only the}} <b>copolar</b> <b>channels</b> of weather radar data {{is used for}} extracting various {{parameters}} or observables. ZDR, kDP and PhiDP for example are prominent extracts from Zxx and Zyy and have {{quite a lot of}} applications in the field of precipitation measurements. Nevertheless, the use of the full polarimetric coherent scattering matrix to extract physical properties according to the scattering process has only poorly been addressed, particularly due to high costs in establishing such complicated systems being able to coherently measure co- and crosspolar scattering amplitudes and phases. However, DLRs "POLDIRAD" is such a fully polarimetric weather radar operating in C-band, able to acquire time series (raw) data, containing all the information needed to apply polarimetric decomposition techniques in order to extract physical information about the illuminated scatterers from the observed scattering process. This paper presents a study about the possibilities of applying coherent polarimetric techniques to time series (raw) data, and the aim is to evaluate an understanding of the potential of such techniques with regard to weather radar data. It will concentrate on the Entropy-Alpha decomposition, based on Pauli-matrices, because the physical interpretation is pretty much straight forward and easy to understand and therefore a good point to start from. This decomposition has originally been developed for application to Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, and hence all the advances in this technique concentrate on targets on the earth's surface rather than meteorological targets as raindrops, snow or hail. The first step is to prepare the data, i. e. changes in phase due to propagation through the medium have to be corrected as well as phase shifts due to Doppler effects. The second step involves calculating the Covariance (or Coherence) matrix from the scattering matrix time series per range bin. Therefrom this matrix contains the statistical fluctuations of targets over time. By diagonalysing the hermitian Covariance matrix in the third step it is possible to extract the dominant physical scattering mechanisms. The observables Entropy and Alpha-angle are quite simple measures, which help to interpret the results. The forth step consists of choosing areas in the Entropy-Alpha plane in order to classify the data. Refinement of this classification using the first Eigenvalue (intensity) might be necessary and thus investigated as well. The results will show that it is clearly possible to distinguish between different types of scattering, and moreover that there is sufficient variation in scattering types to be able to apply a reasonable classification. It is not only possible to differentiate meteorological targets, but also to detect ground clutter or areas with high noise levels, which simplifies the process of pre-classifying weather radar data. Furthermore the results will be compared to "traditional" classification methods in order to analyse, if this new method provides additional, complementary or maybe even completely new information or relations...|$|R
