25|$|The Pequod is now heading {{southeast}} toward Moby Dick. A man falls overboard {{from the}} mast. The life buoy is thrown, but both sink. Now Queequeg proposes that his superfluous coffin {{be used as}} a new life buoy. Starbuck orders the carpenter take care it is lidded and caulked. Next morning, the ship meets in another truncated gam with the Rachel, commanded by Captain Gardiner from Nantucket. The Rachel is seeking survivors from one of her whaleboats which had gone after Moby Dick. Among the missing is Gardiner's young son. Ahab refuses to join the search. Twenty-four hours a day, Ahab now stands and walks the deck, while Fedallah shadows him. Suddenly, a sea hawk grabs Ahab's slouched hat and flies off with it. Next, the Pequod, in a ninth and final gam, meets the Delight, badly damaged and with five of her crew left dead by Moby Dick. Her captain shouts that the harpoon which can kill the white whale has yet to be forged, but Ahab flourishes his special lance and once more orders the ship forward. Ahab shares a moment of contemplation with Starbuck. Ahab speaks about his wife and child, <b>calls</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> fool for spending 40 years on whaling, and claims he can see his own child in Starbuck's eye. Starbuck tries to persuade Ahab to return to Nantucket to meet both their families, but Ahab simply crosses the deck and stands near Fedallah.|$|E
25|$|Six {{books in}} elegiacs survive of this second ambitious poem that Ovid {{was working on}} when he was exiled. The six books cover the first {{semester}} of the year, with each book dedicated to a different month of the Roman calendar (January to June). The project seems unprecedented in Roman literature. It seems that Ovid planned to cover the whole year, {{but was unable to}} finish because of his exile, although he did revise sections of the work at Tomis, and he claims at Trist. 2.549–52 that his work was interrupted after six books. Like the Metamorphoses, the Fasti was to be a long poem and emulated aetiological poetry by writers like Callimachus and, more recently, Propertius and his fourth book. The poem goes through the Roman calendar, explaining the origins and customs of important Roman festivals, digressing on mythical stories, and giving astronomical and agricultural information appropriate to the season. The poem was probably dedicated to Augustus initially, but perhaps the death of the emperor prompted Ovid to change the dedication to honor Germanicus. Ovid uses direct inquiry of gods and scholarly research to talk about the calendar and regularly <b>calls</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> vates, a priest. He also seems to emphasize unsavory, popular traditions of the festivals, imbuing the poem with a popular, plebeian flavor, which some have interpreted as subversive to the Augustan moral legislation. While this poem has always been invaluable to students of Roman religion and culture for the wealth of antiquarian material it preserves, it recently has been seen as one of Ovid's finest literary works and a unique contribution to Roman elegiac poetry.|$|E

500|$|Although Protestant, the MacLeods of Raasay {{supported}} Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1745. After {{the defeat}} at the Battle of Culloden, the Prince spent 2 days hiding from the British troops on Raasay {{and as a}} consequence of the island's support for the Jacobite cause the original Raasay House and many dwellings were burnt down by government troops. In conversation with Malcolm MacLeod of Raasay during his short stay on the island the Prince confided that although his life on the run was hard, he would rather live that way for ten years than be captured as he feared assassination. He seemed less aware of the risks his supporters ran. The atrocities perpetrated in the aftermath of Culloden were a shock to him. Of Cumberland he said: [...] "Surely that man who <b>calls</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> duke and pretends to be so great a general cannot be guilty of such cruelties. I cannot believe it." ...|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{his senior}} year, Jeff Barker of The Baltimore Sun noted that Turner's {{strengths}} were [...] "poise, smarts, [...] toughness," [...] {{while he had}} room for improvement in arm strength and mobility. Barker said, [...] "He's a bit streaky—he <b>calls</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> 'rhythm' passer … But he doesn't quit when things go poorly. His coolness can be mistaken for apathy." [...] Turner typically confines himself to the pocket, as his ability to run the ball himself is limited by his speed. He has made light of his own lack of quickness by saying that he runs a [...] "flat 5.0"-second 40-yard dash. The CBS Sports-affiliated NFL Draft Scout records his actual time as ranging {{from a low of}} 4.89to a high of 5.16seconds, while Scout.com reports his 40-yard time as 4.8seconds. Turner's supposedly one-dimensional nature, however, has occasionally allowed him to make unexpected plays with his feet. The most noteworthy of these were the momentum-changing 41-yard option run against NC State in 2007, and the fourth-down nine-yard scramble into field goal range against North Carolina in 2008.|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{incorporated}} utopian {{themes in}} his previous works but reviewers were divided on whether The Years of Rice and Salt qualified as a utopian story. Those that did call the world described in the story as utopian cited the story's illustration of progress. However, those that wrote The Years of Rice and Salt was not a utopian story say that the world history presented is not necessarily better or worse than the real history, just different. Robinson <b>calls</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> [...] "utopian novelist" [...] in that he claims [...] "all science fiction has a utopian element, in that it tends to say that what we do now matters and will have consequences". Several other themes were identified by reviewers. Robinson had previously used the theme of memory (or identity) and incorporates it into this story with characters who are reincarnated versions of previous characters and who only recognize each other while in the bardo, but sometimes feel a connection between themselves while on earth. The reviewer in The Globe and Mail identified feminism and [...] "struggles over the nature of Islam" [...] as recurring themes.|$|E
500|$|In {{the third}} season, Beiste {{continues}} as football coach, and is recruited by Will to co-direct the school musical West Side Story with guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) and Artie. Beiste orders {{the football team}} to play the Jets in the show. Beiste also takes {{on the task of}} running the school elections. In the episode [...] "The First Time", the coach begins dating Ohio State football recruiter Cooter Menkins (Eric Bruskotter), who is scouting for talent at McKinley, but discovers in [...] "I Kissed a Girl" [...] that Sue has become a rival for Cooter's affections just as Beiste begins {{to fall in love with}} him, thus prompting the character's first solo song, [...] "Jolene". Beiste later tells Emma and Sue, in episode [...] "Yes/No", that Beiste and Cooter have impulsively gotten married. A few months later, in the episode [...] "Choke", Beiste is hit by Cooter and given a black eye. Although initially convinced by Sue and Roz Washington (NeNe Leakes) to leave for Beiste's own safety, the coach later returns home to give Cooter a second chance, before ultimately leaving him and giving him back his wedding ring. The catalyst for the final break is Puck (Mark Salling), a football player and glee club member. Beiste stops a fight between Puck and another student: Puck is wielding a knife, and the coach berates him for doing something so stupid. Puck <b>calls</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> loser, and starts crying; Beiste cries with him, saying that no one ever thinks the two of them hurt because they are [...] "badasses", but they do. Beiste arranges for Puck to retake a geography exam he flunked, which is keeping him from graduating high school, and helps him study for it; he passes and graduates. In the interim, Beiste helps chaperone New Directions on their trip to Chicago, where they win the national show choir championship.|$|E

The character was created by writer Simon Furman and artist Geoff Senior for the company's Marvel UK imprint. Furman decided to use Death's Head in his Transformers stories, but believed that characters appearing in Transformers [...] "were prone to be absorbed into that title's catchall copyright" [...] (allowing Hasbro to contest their ownership) {{and led to a}} one-page strip titled [...] "High Noon Tex" [...] (which was subsequently published in various Marvel UK titles) being hastily created to establish Marvel's ownership of the character.
