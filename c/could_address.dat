5|$|Lara {{appealed the}} denial of his motion to dismiss to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the Tribal Court {{obtained}} its authority from the ICRA, an act of Congress, and that both the Tribal Court and the Federal Court derived their power from the same sovereign. A three-judge panel of the Circuit Court affirmed {{the decision of the}} District Court, holding that the tribe derived its power from its own retained sovereignty that was separate from the sovereignty of the United States. The Eighth Circuit's panel noted that in the Duro decision, the Supreme Court had observed that Congress <b>could</b> <b>address</b> the jurisdictional system, which Congress did. When Congress amended the ICRA, they were addressing a federal common law issue, not a constitutional issue, and were within their authority to recognize the sovereignty of the tribes. The panel then affirmed the trial court on the Petite claim. Judge Hansen dissented, believing that the tribe drew its authority to try Lara from the federal government.|$|E

25|$|Following {{discussions with}} FFMIT, the {{university}} administration initiated a “campus-wide conversation” {{on climate change}} to take place from November 2014 to May 2015, which included {{the formation of the}} MIT Climate Change Conversation Committee.

The conversation included solicitation of ideas and opinions of MIT community members, {{as well as a number}} of public events. The largest event was a fossil fuel divestment debate among six prominent voices on climate change that was attended by approximately 500 people.|$|E
25|$|The read/write memory between address 0100 {{hexadecimal}} and {{the lowest}} address of the BDOS was the Transient Program Area (TPA) available for CP/M application programs. Although all Z80 and 8080 processors <b>could</b> <b>address</b> 64 kilobytes of memory, the amount available for application programs could vary, depending {{on the design of}} the particular computer. Some computers used large parts of the address space for such things as BIOS ROMs, or video display memory. As a result, some systems had more TPA memory available than others. Bank switching was a common technique that allowed systems to have a large TPA while switching out ROM or video memory space as needed. CP/M 3.0 allowed parts of the BDOS to be in bank-switched memory as well.|$|E

He also attempted to erect stakes on all major crossroads, to show the people what would happen to them if they engaged in theft or murder, or if they failed to attend church services.

25|$|The premiere {{was given}} at the Königliches Hof- und National-Theater, Munich, on June 21, 1868. The {{production}} was sponsored by Ludwig II of Bavaria and the conductor was Hans von Bülow. Franz Strauss, {{the father of the}} composer Richard Strauss played the French horn at the premiere, despite his often-expressed dislike of Wagner, who was present at many of the rehearsals. Wagner's frequent interruptions and digressions made rehearsals a very long-winded affair. After one 5 hour rehearsal, Franz Strauss led a strike by the orchestra, saying that he could not play any more. Despite these problems, the premiere was a triumph, and the opera was hailed as one of Wagner's most successful works. At {{the end of the first}} performance, the audience called for Wagner, who appeared at the front of the Royal box, which he had been sharing with King Ludwig. Wagner bowed to the crowd, breaking court protocol, which dictated that only the monarch <b>could</b> <b>address</b> an audience from the box.|$|E
25|$|To {{maintain}} {{compatibility with}} older operating systems and applications, the 640 KB barrier remained {{part of the}} PC design even after the 8086/8088 had been replaced with the Intel 286 processor, which <b>could</b> <b>address</b> up to 16 MB of memory in Protected mode. The 1 MB barrier also remained {{as long as the}} 286 was running in Real mode, since DOS required Real mode which uses the segment and offset registers in an overlapped manner such that addresses with more than 20 bits are not possible. It is still present in IBM PC compatibles today if they are running in Real mode such as used by DOS. Even the most modern Intel PCs still have the area between 640 and 1024 KB reserved. This however is invisible to programs (or even most of the operating system) on newer operating systems (such as Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X) that use virtual memory, because they have no awareness of physical memory addresses at all. Instead they operate within a virtual address space, which is defined independently of available RAM addresses.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} {{to expand the}} memory and instruction set for Block II, but to retain the Block I's restrictive three-bit op. code and 12-bit address had interesting design consequences. Various tricks were employed to squeeze in additional instructions, such as having special memory addresses which, when referenced, would implement a certain function. For instance, an INDEX to address 25 triggered the RESUME instruction to return from an interrupt. Likewise, INDEX 17 performed an INHINT instruction (inhibit interrupts), while INDEX 16 reenabled them (RELINT). Other instructions were implemented by preceding them with a special version of TC called EXTEND. The address spaces were extended by employing the Bank (fixed) and Ebank (erasable) registers, so the only memory of either type that could be addressed {{at any given time}} was the current bank, plus the small amount of fixed-fixed memory and the erasable memory. In addition, the bank register <b>could</b> <b>address</b> a maximum of 32 kilowords, so an Sbank (super-bank) register was required to access the last 4 kilowords. All across-bank subroutine calls had to be initiated from fixed-fixed memory through special functions to restore the original bank during the return: essentially a system of far pointers.|$|E
