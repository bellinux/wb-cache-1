25|$|Even in Russia, the {{situation}} for language preservation is not favorable: the <b>carriers</b> of <b>language</b> are scattered in different villages and often isolated from each other. The Nanai language continues {{to be used in}} the sphere of everyday contact among people older than 40. In their contact with people their age or younger, they prefer the Russian language, using Nanaian only for contact with elderly people aged 70 or older. On the whole, the Nanai language has been superseded by Russian in almost all spheres of communication; drastic measures are required for language preservation.|$|R
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that among the {{contemporary}} <b>carriers</b> of Nanaian <b>language</b> (middle and lower Amur dialects), dialect levelling and mixing has occurred due to extensive population migrations and the system of teaching of Nanai language (based on the Naykhin dialect); therefore it is difficult to differentiate the dialects in contemporary language data.|$|R

5000|$|The Dakelh people once enjoyed {{extensive}} literacy {{with the}} script. It is recorded {{that it was}} often used to write messages on trees, and Morice published a newspaper in syllabics which was in print from 1891 to 1894. Some transcriptions of Latin and English have been recorded as well. Its usage began to decline around 1920, when the <b>Carrier</b> <b>language</b> was banned from the local schools. In liturgical publications, such as prayer books, the <b>Carrier</b> <b>language</b> became written in a non-standard form of the Latin alphabet, which used many English sound values, such as [...] for [...] and [...] for [...] The switch was rather abrupt, {{to the point that}} parents would write in syllabics and their children would write in the alphabet, and neither could understand the other's writing.|$|E

50|$|However, Sardinians {{as a whole}} are not a {{homogeneous}} population genetically: some studies have found some differences between the various regions of the island; in this regard, the mountainous region of Ogliastra is more distant {{from the rest of}} Europe and the Mediterranean than other Sardinian sub-regions located in the plains and in the coastal areas, in part because these more accessible areas show, like the rest of much of Europe, a moderate genetic influx from the Yamna culture pastoralists, thought to be the <b>carriers</b> of Indo-European <b>languages</b> into Europe, while Ogliastra has retained unaltered Mesolithic/Neolithic roots.|$|R
