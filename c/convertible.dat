Everything from Firebirds to Celicas, Continentals to Cutlass Cieras were modified into <b>convertibles.</b> Tens of thousands of cars were converted by several dozen coachbuilders across the country.|$|R

50|$|The {{decline in}} {{popularity}} of <b>convertibles</b> in the US was partly caused by concern about lack of protection in rollover accidents, because most <b>convertibles</b> have no protection beyond the windshield frame. Some <b>convertibles</b> provide rollover protection using two protruding curved bars behind the headrests. Some Mercedes-Benz <b>convertibles</b> have a retractable roll bar which deploys {{in case of}} an accident. Race cars almost always have roll cages, since racing is very likely to result in a rollover. In addition, the roll cage's chassis-stiffening effect is usually seen as a benefit to the car.|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{a popular}} {{financing}} strategy whereby {{the manager of}} a firm uses <b>convertibles</b> in staged financing. Staged financing is particularly popular in corporate finance, even although it has potential incentive and risk problems. This paper identifies many interesting properties of <b>convertibles</b> in staged financing, including the fact that staged financing using <b>convertibles</b> can almost achieve the first best. We also find that risks can reduce agency costs by putting pressure on the manager to perform. These results may explain why <b>convertibles</b> are a popular instrument in staged financing in reality. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R

Subsequently, the division added sedan, coupé, <b>convertible</b> and SUV models. Lexus did not exist as a brand in its home market until 2005, and all vehicles marketed internationally as Lexus from 1989 to 2005 were released in Japan under the Toyota marque and an equivalent model name. In 2005, a hybrid version of the RX crossover debuted and additional hybrid models later joined the division's lineup. Lexus launched its own F marque performance division in 2007 with the debut of the IS F sport sedan, followed by the LFA supercar in 2009.|$|E

2500|$|This volatility/credit {{dichotomy}} is {{the standard}} practice for valuing <b>convertibles.</b> [...] What makes <b>convertibles</b> so interesting is that, except {{in the case of}} exchangeables (see above), one cannot entirely separate the volatility from the credit. [...] Higher volatility (a good thing) tends to accompany weaker credit (bad). In the case of exchangeables, the credit quality of the issuer may be decoupled from the volatility of the underlying shares. [...] The true artists of <b>convertibles</b> and exchangeables are the people who know how to play this balancing act.|$|R
