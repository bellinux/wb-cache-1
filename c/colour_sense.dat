60|$|The {{importance}} of submitting our faculties to measurement {{lies in the}} curious unconsciousness {{in which we are}} apt to live of our personal peculiarities, and which our intimate friends often fail to remark. I have spoken of the ignorance of elderly persons of their deafness to high notes, but even the existence of such a peculiarity as colour blindness was not suspected until the memoir of Dalton in 1794. That one person out of twenty-nine or thereabouts should be unable to distinguish a red from a green, without knowing that he had any deficiency of <b>colour</b> <b>sense,</b> and without betraying his deficiency to his friends, seems perfectly incredible to the other twenty-eight; yet {{as a matter of fact}} he rarely does either the one or the other. It is hard to convince the colour-blind of their own infirmity. I have seen curious instances of this: one was that of a person by no means unpractised in physical research, who had been himself tested in matching colours. He gave me his own version of the result, to the effect that though he might perhaps have fallen a little short of perfection as judged by over-refined tests, his <b>colour</b> <b>sense</b> was for all practical purposes quite good. On the other hand, the operator assured me that when he had toned the intensities of a pure red and a pure green in a certain proportion, the person ceased to be able to distinguish between them! Colour blindness is often very difficult to detect, because the test hues and tints may be discriminated by other means than by the normal <b>colour</b> <b>sense.</b> Ordinary pigments are never pure, and the test colours may be distinguished by those of their adventitious hues to which the partly colour-blind man may be sensitive. We do not suspect ourselves to be yellow-blind by candle light, because we enjoy pictures in the evening nearly or perhaps quite as much as in the day time; yet we may observe that a yellow primrose laid on the white table-cloth wholly loses its colour by candle light, and becomes as white as a snowdrop.|$|E

The paper describes the design and development of a camera-based <b>colour</b> <b>sensing</b> system for car repainting application. A camera will capture a picture for small undamaged part of the car panel. This picture will be passed to a program for analyzing and coding the actual colour to its basic colour percentages.

During two months, the evolution of his colour vision deficit was followed with repeated standardized colour vision tests and eye movement recordings. While his performance continuously improved, he became more and more aware of the deficit. Only after colour vision had almost normalized, his subjective colour sensation was inconspicuous again. The simultaneous occurrence of achromatopsia and the corresponding anosognosia and their parallel recovery suggest that both deficits were due to dysfunction of the same brain region. Consequently, the subjective experience of colour loss in achromatopsia may depend on the residual function of the damaged colour centre...|$|E
40|$|Hereditary retinopathies {{represent}} a heterogenic group of retinal diseases which {{can have a}} very different symptomatic complex. Most of the hereditary retinal dystrophies affect the photoreceptors (rods and cones) and the retinal pigmentary epithelium. Cone diseases result in nocturnal disturbance of vision and losses of the peripheral visual field, rod diseases result in disturbances concerning the <b>colour</b> <b>sense,</b> impaired vision, sensitivity for blinding and losses of the central field. Literature presents a range of publications concerning specific retinal diseases but a comparable survey analysing a great number of different macula- and cone dystrophies by using a constant technology does not exist. The aim of this dissertation is to analyse the clinical validity of the multifocal electroretinogram regarding variability and differential diagnostics of the examination of retinal dystrophies with central dysfunction (= macula- and cone dystrophies). This retrospective survey looks at the clinical history of 186 patients who visited the ophthalmic clinic of the University Hospital Benjamin Franklin in Berlin in the years from 1996 until 2001. 261 of 372 eyes were able to be examined. The reason why only 261 eyes were able to be examined was that the recordings of the multifocal electroretinogram were too artifactual, amongst this blindness of an eye or the certain requests of a patient played a major role. The multifocal electroretinogram is a special method to examine local retinal areas above all macula dystrophies and captures local stimulus responses. The multifocal electroretinogram ia a relatively new electrophysiological method to examine the macula within about seven minutes (without preparation time). With the multifocal electroretinogram rods, cones, ganglion cells and bipolar cells can be stimulated. The purpose of this dissertation was to evaluate the multifocal electroretinogram of every eye. For this purpose curves were activated in a VERIS data bank, the average value of the curves were selected in a circular distance to the fovea and for each of the curves the results for the amplitude of the B-wave P 1, for the peak time of the A-wave N 1 and for the peak time of the B-wave P 1 were acquired. Therefore 15 data were acquired for five curves. The results of the multifocal electroretinogram show partially different functional disorders for the different macula dystrophies. It shows comparing the results of the multifocal electroretinogram of the different macula dystrophies that there can be a distinct discrepancy between morphological and functional changes. Concerning the medical findings we expected that the functional failures were worst of all for the central areolar choroidal dystrophy and for the Stargardt’s disease. Surprisingly there is a minimal functional failure for the hereditary drusen comparing them with the adult vitelliform macula dystrophy although the hereditary drusen affect a much bigger area than only the central fovea. On top of that the kind of functional failure concerning the cone system of every different macula dystrophy is apparently different. Nevertheless it remains unclear why in this and in other surveys in a much bigger area there are delays for the latency but no decreasing of the amplitude for the Best’s disease. The latency delays are found in areas with normal morphology. To the contrary the hereditary drusen, a disease mainly having affects under the pigmentary epithelium and on the photoreceptors similar to the Best’s disease, showed in the multifocal electroretinogram no functional losses in areas of distinct morphological alteration. Cone dystrophies lead to a much greater provable loss of function in the multifocal electroretinogram than macula dystrophies concerning the manifestation of the decreasing of the amplitude as a sign for the cone function as well as the delay for the latency as a sign for the transmission of the information in the cone system. The results show that the multifocal electroretinogram is suitable to make precise distinctions of regional functional disorders of hereditary retinopathies which mainly have affects on the cone system. A differential diagnosis of the different macula dystrophies or cone dystrophies is not possible. Except for the enhanced S cone syndrome: the distribution of the latencies with increasing eccentricity is characteristic. The varying results of the multifocal electroretinogram for the different macula dystrophies reveal however that the correlation between morphological changes and functional losses cannot always be comprehensible. Summarized the multifocal electroretinogram allows a distinction between macula dystrophies and cone dystrophies, a specific diagnosis of a enhanced S cone syndrome and a detailed and differentiated definition of regional functional disorders of hereditary retinopathies mainly concerning the cone system...|$|E
