25|$|Hertford {{discussed}} with Privy Council {{the possibility of}} Scottish allies capturing Cardinal Beaton during his invasion. Henry VIII believed that Beaton, a favourer of the Auld Alliance with France, was particularly responsible for {{the rejection of the}} marriage plan. Beaton's would-be kidnappers included James Kirkcaldy of Grange, Norman Leslie Master of Rothes, and John Charteris who offered to attempt to capture the Cardinal as he travelled in Fife. Their second scheme was to attack Arbroath while attention was focussed on Edinburgh. This offer was made by Alexander Crichton of Brunstane who sent a messenger called Wishart to Lord Hertford. Time was too short to offer military support for these plans, but if those concerned would join in the destruction of Church property they would be offered asylum in England and £1000 to fund their action. Any schemes more elaborate than a punitive raid on Edinburgh were shelved as Henry VIII <b>committed</b> <b>resources</b> to the siege of Boulogne in France already planned for the summer.|$|E

5000|$|Conversion {{should be}} {{distinguished}} from economic diversification although the two processes overlap. Conversion involves the maximum reuse of military <b>committed</b> <b>resources,</b> {{with the emphasis on}} reuse of existing personnel. The key personnel within defense firms are engineers and factory workers, and managers skilled in managing innovations. Another key emphasis in conversion is in the area of new product development. Diversification can involve financial manipulation, e.g. in purchasing new firms, which leaves in place existing commitments to military production. Sometimes however, economic conversion requires purchase of another firm to supply [...] "complementary capacities." [...] Generally, conversion can be supported by various factors that help defense firms overcome specialization.|$|E

50|$|Operation Savannah {{was widely}} {{regarded}} as a strategic failure. South Africa and the US had <b>committed</b> <b>resources</b> and manpower to the initial objective of preventing a FAPLA victory prior to Angolan independence, which was achieved. However, it also provided the MPLA politburo with a reason to increase the deployment of Cuban troops and Soviet advisers exponentially. The CIA correctly predicted that Cuba and the Soviet Union would continue to support FAPLA at whatever level was necessary to prevail, while South Africa was inclined to withdraw its forces rather than risk incurring heavy casualties. The SADF had suffered between 28 and 35 killed in action. An additional 100 were wounded. Seven South Africans were captured and displayed at Angolan press briefings as living proof of the SADF's involvement. Cuban casualties {{were known to be}} much higher; several hundred were killed in engagements with the SADF or UNITA. Twenty Cubans were taken prisoner: seventeen by UNITA, and three by the South Africans.|$|E
5000|$|The {{presence}} {{of only two}} coloured players in the winning team's starting line-up, 13 {{years after the end}} of white minority rule, has led to a new bout of soul-searching about how to ensure the progress of more black players. However, the debate may however be moving away from quotas and transformation. The failure to develop sport at school level is one of the country's biggest mistakes, President Thabo Mbeki said in Pretoria where he was handed the Webb Ellis Cup by the Springboks following their World Cup victory against England. [...] "We don't put sufficient development in sports and we haven't <b>committed</b> <b>resources</b> needed and this is one of our biggest mistakes". He said development needed to be built from below. Sports and Recreation Minister Makhenkesi Stofile recently emphasised the development of talent, ruled out racial quotas for national teams pointing out that this resulted merely in window dressing for international consumption, as a failed experiment in South African rugby showed a few years ago.|$|E

5000|$|Henry VIII of England {{wished to}} unite the Kingdom of Scotland with the Kingdom of England, or at least bring the kingdom under his hegemony. He had {{contracted}} with the Regent Arran that Mary, Queen of Scots would marry his son, Prince Edward. But Arran allowed the Parliament of Scotland to revoke this agreement prompting Henry to declare war in December 1543, and now the Regent was making ground against his rebels who still supported the English marriage, such as the Earl of Lennox, Earl of Glencairn, the Earl of Cassillis and the Earl of Angus. These nobles were in touch with Henry VIII via Lennox's secretary Thomas Bishop and Angus's chaplain, Master John Penven. Their letters to Henry VIII requested intervention, and in March he replied that a 'main army' was in preparation. Henry's Privy Council issued his instructions for the invasion force on 10 April 1544, and they were to;"Put all to fire and sword, burn Edinburgh, so razed and defaced when you have sacked and gotten what ye can of it, as there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon (them) for their falsehood and disloyalty." [...] Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, at this time called Lord Hertford was the King's Lieutenant of this Army Royal. He had considered establishing an English garrison at Leith but the Privy Council vetoed this plan. Henry VIII had also asked him to destroy St Andrews, but Lord Hertford pointed out the extra distance would be troublesome.Hertford discussed with Privy Council the possibility of Scottish allies capturing Cardinal Beaton during his invasion.
