500|$|... 16th-century Poland {{was officially}} a [...] "republic of nobles", and the [...] "middle class" [...] of the nobility (individuals {{at a lower}} social level than [...] "magnates") formed the leading {{component}} during the later Jagiellonian period and afterwards. Nonetheless, members of the magnate families held the highest state and church offices. At that time, the szlachta in Poland and Lithuania was ethnically diversified and represented several religious denominations. During this period of tolerance, such factors had little bearing on one's economic status or career potential. Jealous of their <b>class</b> <b>privilege</b> ("freedoms"), the Renaissance szlachta developed a sense of public service duties, educated their youth, took keen interest in current trends and affairs and traveled widely. While the Golden Age of Polish Culture adopted western humanism and Renaissance patterns, the lifestyles of Polish nobles acquired a distinctly eastern flavor beginning {{in the second half}} of the 16th century. Visiting foreigners often remarked on the splendor of their residencies and the conspicuous consumption of wealthy Polish nobles.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1982 {{published}} {{conversation about}} black feminism and lesbian activism with her sister, Beverly Smith, Barbara Smith, {{co-author of the}} Combahee River Collective Statement expresses concerns that, [...] "to the extent that lesbians of color must struggle simultaneously against the racism of white women (as against sexism), separatism impedes the building of alliances with men of color". Smith writes that race places lesbians of color in a different relation to men as white lesbians, as [...] "white women with <b>class</b> <b>privilege</b> don't share oppression with white men. They're in a critical and antagonistic position whereas Black women and other women of color definitely share oppressed situations with men of their race". Smith makes {{a distinction between the}} theory of separatism, and the practice of separatism, stating that it is the way separatism has been practiced which has led to [...] "an isolated, single-issued understanding and practice of politics, which ignores the range of oppressions that women experience".|$|E
60|$|HAMILTON AND JEFFERSON. These two statesmen, {{who became}} bitter antagonists during the {{struggle}} over the Constitution, may be selected as typical of all the rest. The story of their splendid services {{in the cause of}} liberty cannot be told here; such men belong to history rather than to literature; but we may at least note that they deserve more careful and unprejudiced study than rival political parties have thus far given them. Their work has a broad human interest which extends far beyond the borders of America, since they stand for two radically different conceptions of life, one aristocratic, the other democratic, which appear in every age and explain the political and social divisions among free peoples. Hamilton (the Federalist) denied the right and the ability of common men to govern themselves; he was the champion of aristocracy, of <b>class</b> <b>privilege,</b> of centralized {{power in the hands of}} the few whom he deemed worthy by birth or talent to govern a nation. The most significant trait of Jefferson (the Anti-Federalist) was his lifelong devotion to democracy. He believed in common men, in their ability to choose the right and their purpose to follow it, and he mightily opposed every tendency to aristocracy or <b>class</b> <b>privilege</b> in America. In {{the struggle over}} the Constitution he was fearful that the United States government would become monarchical if given too much authority, and aimed to safeguard democracy by leaving the governing power as largely as possible in the hands of the several states. To readers who are not politicians the most interesting thing concerning these two leaders is that Hamilton, the champion of aristocracy, was obscurely born and appeared here as a stranger to make his own way by his own efforts; while Jefferson, the uncompromising democrat, came from an excellent Virginia family and was familiar from his youth with aristocratic society.|$|E

60|$|But {{it is we}} who are the morbid exceptions; it is we who are the {{criminal}} class. This should be our great comfort. The vast mass of humanity, with their vast mass of idle books and idle words, have never doubted and never will doubt that courage is splendid, that fidelity is noble, that distressed ladies should be rescued, and vanquished enemies spared. There are {{a large number of}} cultivated persons who doubt these maxims of daily life, just as there are a large number of persons who believe they are the Prince of Wales; and I am told that both classes of people are entertaining conversationalists. But the average man or boy writes daily in these great gaudy diaries of his soul, which we call Penny Dreadfuls, a plainer and better gospel than any of those iridescent ethical paradoxes that the fashionable change as often as their bonnets. It may be a very limited aim in morality to shoot a 'many-faced and fickle traitor,' but at least it is a better aim than to be a many-faced and fickle traitor, which is a simple summary of a good many modern systems from Mr. d'Annunzio's downwards. So long as the coarse and thin texture of mere current popular romance is not touched by a paltry culture it will never be vitally immoral. It is always on the side of life. The poor--the slaves who really stoop under the burden of life--have often been mad, scatter-brained and cruel, but never hopeless. That is a <b>class</b> <b>privilege,</b> like cigars. Their drivelling literature will always be a 'blood and thunder' literature, as simple as the thunder of heaven and the blood of men.|$|E

50|$|The new rhetorical {{appeal of}} {{education}} was augmented by specific policies which made social mobility through education more feasible for many Egyptians.

40|$|The article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the leaders of the Zaporozhian Host proving the legitimacy of the revolutionary outburst of 1648. Attention is paid to the Cossacks' increasing social and political awareness during 1630 s, realizing there rights as knights and gaining functions of the «political nation». The author contradicts attempts at depicting the Cossacks as a military society, identical to mercenaries with all their wicked traits. The author supports the idea of all the participants of the outburst regarding their actions as fully legitimate, as they were not only defending their <b>class</b> <b>privileges,</b> but also the rights and freedoms the King granted the Ruthenian nation and the Orthodox Church...|$|R
50|$|Individualist feminists {{attempt to}} change legal systems to {{eliminate}} <b>class</b> <b>privileges</b> and gender privileges {{and to ensure that}} individuals have equal rights, including an equal claim under the law to their own persons and property. Individualist feminism encourages women to take full responsibility for their own lives. It also opposes any government interference into the choices adults make with their own bodies because, it contends, such interference creates a coercive hierarchy (such as patriarchy). One central theme of individualist feminism revolves around the Free Love Movement, which indicates that a woman's sexual choices should be made by her and her alone, rather than by government regulations.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} free {{education}} for the poor was not exclusive to Calasanz. In the Duchy of Lorraine, a similar project was being undertaken simultaneously by the Augustinians Peter Fourier and Alix Le Clerc, whose educational heritage was carried to New France. As recognized by Ludwig von Pastor, Calasanz was {{the founder of the}} first free public school in modern Europe. In both cases, it was a revolutionary initiative, a radical break with the <b>class</b> <b>privileges</b> that kept the masses marginalized and in poverty. In the history of education, Calasanz is an educator of the poor, offering education free of charge to all classes of society, without discrimination.|$|R
