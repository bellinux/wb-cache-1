5|$|Fleance {{appears in}} Shakespeare's Macbeth. However, only his <b>childhood</b> <b>is</b> portrayed; {{the rest of}} his story, as it is {{described}} in Holinshed's Chronicles, does not appear in Shakespeare's play. Scholars suggest that Shakespeare does not elaborate on Fleance's life after his escape from Scotland to avoid unnecessary distraction from the story of Macbeth himself.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia affects around 0.3–0.7% {{of people}} {{at some point in}} their life, or 24million people {{worldwide}} as of 2011. It occurs 1.4times more frequently in males than females and typically appears earlier in men—the peak ages of onset are 25 years for males and 27 years for females. Onset in <b>childhood</b> <b>is</b> much rarer, as is onset in middle or old age.|$|E
5|$|Abuse during <b>childhood</b> <b>is</b> {{accepted}} as a primary social factor increasing the incidence of self-harm, as is bereavement, and troubled parental or partner relationships. Factors such as war, poverty, and unemployment may also contribute. Self-harm is frequently described as an experience of depersonalisation or a dissociative state. As many as 70% of individuals with borderline personality disorder engage in self-harm. An estimated 30% of individuals with autism spectrum disorders engage in self-harm at some point, including eye-poking, skin-picking, hand-biting, and head-banging.|$|E

5|$|In 2013 about 3.3 {{million cases}} of self-harm occurred. Self-harm is most common {{between the ages}} of 12 and 24. Self-harm in <b>childhood</b> <b>is</b> {{relatively}} rare but the rate has been increasing since the 1980s. However, self-harm behaviour can occur at any age, including in the elderly population. The risk of serious injury and suicide is higher in older people who self-harm. Self-harm is not limited to humans. Captive animals, such as birds and monkeys, are also known to participate in self-harming behaviour.|$|E
5|$|ML Pin {{recalled}} {{in his autobiography}} that although {{his mother was a}} kind and loving figure, his father was rather strict and acted more like a teacher than a father, and that he was often fearful of him. A loyal servant of the crown, MR Pia introduced ML Pin to King Vajiravudh when he was seven years old. Another often-recounted story from his <b>childhood</b> <b>is</b> that of how, before having learned to count, when his mother asked him to gather half a bunch of betel leaves for her, ML Pin set down to picking up one leaf with each hand at a time, separating them equally into two piles.|$|E
5|$|The {{title of}} the episode is an homage to Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel Last Exit to Brooklyn, one subplot of which {{involves}} the corruption and downfall of a union leader during a strike. The body of the union president is seen buried under a football field, a homage to the mystery surrounding the whereabouts of Jimmy Hoffa and his alleged burial at New Jersey's Giants Stadium. Mr. Burns' outfit in the flashback to his <b>childhood</b> <b>is</b> based on Buster Brown. Homer's imagination of a life of organized crime is based on Don Fanucci's first appearance in The Godfather Part II, accepting donuts rather than a necklace and an orange.|$|E

5|$|Abu Bakr {{was born}} around 1321 to his sultan father an-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1310–1341) and his {{concubine}} mother, Narjis. Narjis also {{gave birth to}} Abu Bakr's younger full brothers Ramadan (died 1343) and Yusuf (died 1346). Information about Abu Bakr's early <b>childhood</b> <b>is</b> unavailable in the Mamluk sources. The first mention of Abu Bakr came in 1332. At that time, Abu Bakr {{had been sent to}} the desert fortress of al-Karak to join his half-brothers Ahmad and Ibrahim in their military training. Also during that year, Abu Bakr left al-Karak to accompany his father and half-brothers Anuk and Ahmad at al-Aqaba and from there to Mecca to perform the Hajj pilgrimage. However, an-Nasir Muhammad had them return to al-Karak before the trek to Mecca.|$|E
5|$|In {{humans and}} many other mammals, new neurons are created mainly before birth, and the infant brain {{contains}} substantially more neurons than the adult brain. There are, however, a few areas where new neurons continue to be generated throughout life. The two areas for which adult neurogenesis is well established are the olfactory bulb, which {{is involved in the}} sense of smell, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, where there is evidence that the new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories. With these exceptions, however, the set of neurons that is present in early <b>childhood</b> <b>is</b> the set that is present for life. Glial cells are different: as with most types of cells in the body, they are generated throughout the lifespan.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{method of}} {{transmission}} reflects {{the prevalence of}} chronic HBV infection in a given area. In low prevalence {{areas such as the}} continental United States and Western Europe, injection drug abuse and unprotected sex are the primary methods, although other factors may also be important. In moderate prevalence areas, which include Eastern Europe, Russia, and Japan, where 2–7% of the population is chronically infected, the disease is predominantly spread among children. In high-prevalence areas such as China and South East Asia, transmission during childbirth is most common, although in other areas of high endemicity such as Africa, transmission during <b>childhood</b> <b>is</b> a significant factor. The prevalence of chronic HBV infection in areas of high endemicity is at least 8% with 10–15% prevalence in Africa/Far East. As of 2010, China has 120 million infected people, followed by India and Indonesia with 40 million and 12 million, respectively. According to World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 600,000 people die every year related to the infection.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the series, Kratos {{is portrayed}} as an antihero, often {{performing}} questionable actions. Although backstory {{is seen in the}} original God of War, Kratos' <b>childhood</b> <b>is</b> revealed in Ghost of Sparta and the birth of his daughter is explored in the God of War comic series. In Ghost of Sparta, it is revealed that an oracle had foretold that the demise of Olympus would not happen by the hands of the Titans—imprisoned after the Great War—but rather by a mortal, a marked warrior. The Olympians Zeus and Ares believed this warrior to be Deimos, Kratos' younger brother, who had strange birthmarks. Ares interrupted the childhood training of Kratos and Deimos in Sparta and kidnapped Deimos. Kratos attempted to stop Ares, but Ares swept him aside and scarred him across his right eye. Taken to Death's Domain, Deimos was imprisoned and tortured for many years by the god of death, Thanatos. Believing Deimos to be dead, Kratos marked himself with a red tattoo, identical to his brother's birthmark, to honor his sibling.|$|E
