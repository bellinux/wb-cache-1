5|$|A {{waterspout}} is {{an intense}} columnar vortex (usually appearing as a funnel-shaped <b>cloud)</b> <b>that</b> occurs over {{a body of}} water. Some are connected to a cumulus congestus cloud, some to a cumuliform cloud and some to a cumulonimbus cloud. In the common form, it is a non-supercell tornado over water.|$|E
5|$|Covalent bonding {{takes place}} {{when one of}} the {{constituent}} atoms loses one or more electrons, with the other atom gaining the electrons, resulting in an electron <b>cloud</b> <b>that</b> is shared by the molecule as a whole. In both ionic and covalent bonding the location of the ions and electrons are constrained relative to each other, thereby resulting in the bond being characteristically brittle.|$|E
5|$|A {{distinct}} defining {{feature of}} a Surtseyan eruption is {{the formation of}} a pyroclastic surge (or base surge), a ground hugging radial <b>cloud</b> <b>that</b> develops along with the eruption column. Base surges are caused by the gravitational collapse of a vaporous eruptive column, one that is denser overall then a regular volcanic column. The densest part of the cloud is nearest to the vent, resulting a wedge shape. Associated with these laterally moving rings are dune-shaped depositions of rock left behind by the lateral movement. These are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags, rock that was flung out by the explosive eruption and followed a ballistic path to the ground. Accumulations of wet, spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli is another common surge indicator.|$|E

5|$|As these larger water {{droplets}} descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens {{most often in}} clouds above freezing, and {{is also known as}} the warm rain process. In clouds below freezing, when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring {{water droplets}}. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a <b>cloud</b> <b>that</b> is below freezing. In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.|$|E
5|$|Just {{minutes after}} the impact, the flyby probe passed by the nucleus at a close {{distance}} of , taking pictures of the crater position, the ejecta plume, and the entire cometary nucleus. The entire event was also photographed by Earth-based telescopes and orbital observatories, including the Hubble, Chandra, Spitzer, and XMM-Newton. The impact was also observed by cameras and spectroscopes on board Europe's Rosetta spacecraft, which was about 80millionkm (50millionmiles) from the comet {{at the time of}} impact. Rosetta determined the composition of the gas and dust <b>cloud</b> <b>that</b> was kicked up by the impact.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett consult Chuck Burks, an {{old friend}} of Fox Mulder's, who tells the two that Siddhi mystics could do the things Scully described; the mystics have powers of the mind and can alter people’s {{perceptions}} of reality. Scully theorizes that a mystic is acting out of revenge since an American plant inadvertently released a gas <b>cloud</b> <b>that</b> killed 118 people in Vishi, outside of Mumbai. One of the victims was the 11-year-old son of a holy man of the beggar caste.|$|E
50|$|Another method {{considered}} for producing the warm polar temperatures were polar stratospheric clouds. Polar stratospheric <b>clouds</b> are <b>clouds</b> <b>that</b> {{occur in the}} lower stratosphere at very low temperatures. Polar stratospheric clouds have {{a great impact on}} radiative forcing. Due to their minimal albedo properties and their optical thickness, polar stratospheric clouds act similar to a greenhouse gas and traps outgoing longwave radiation. Different types of polar stratospheric clouds occur in the atmosphere: polar stratospheric <b>clouds</b> <b>that</b> are created due to interactions with nitric or sulfuric acid and water (Type I) or polar stratospheric <b>clouds</b> <b>that</b> are created with only water ice (Type II).|$|R

5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{hypothesized}} fire and/or nuclear winter effects, the impact would have inhibited photosynthesis {{by creating a}} dust <b>cloud</b> <b>that</b> blocked sunlight {{for up to a}} year. Further, the asteroid struck a region of sulfur-rich carbonate rock, much of which was vaporized, thereby injecting sulfuric acid aerosols into the stratosphere, which might have reduced sunlight reaching the Earth's surface by more than 50%, and would have caused rain and ocean water to become acidic. The acidification of the oceans would kill many organisms that build shells from calcium carbonate. At Brazos section, the paleo-sea surface temperature dropped as much as 7℃ for decades after the impact. It would take at least ten years for such aerosols to dissipate, and would account for the extinction of plants and phytoplankton, and of organisms dependent on them (including predatory animals as well as herbivores). Some creatures whose food chains were based on detritus would have a reasonable chance of survival, however.|$|E
5|$|Because Stuyvesant was {{so close}} to the World Trade Center site, there were {{concerns}} of asbestos exposure. The US EPA indicated at that time that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy of the assessment. Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there have been other cases linked to the same dust <b>cloud</b> <b>that</b> emanated from Ground Zero, a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant, there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance as a result.|$|E
5|$|Kadaj confronts Rufus Shinra, who reveals he {{possesses}} the box containing Jenova's remains. He attempts to destroy it, but Kadaj manages {{to save it}} and flees the city with his companions. Yazoo and Loz are apparently destroyed along the way by an explosive planted by Shinra's agents. Cloud chases Kadaj down and engages him in battle, ultimately subduing him. Outmatched, Kadaj opens Jenova's box and fuses with its contents, transforming into Sephiroth. He then tells <b>Cloud</b> <b>that</b> {{he will be able}} to use the life essences of Geostigma sufferers to achieve complete domination over the planet. He and Cloud then fight, and throughout the whole encounter, Sephiroth appears to have the upper hand, flinging Cloud repeatedly into walls and finally impaling him through the shoulder. He asks Cloud to tell him what he most cherishes so that he can have the pleasure of taking it away. To this, Cloud replies that he cherishes everything, then pulls out Sephiroth's sword and deals him a hail of devastating blows. Sephiroth's spirit departs, leaving behind the mortally wounded Kadaj. As he lies dying in Cloud's arms, a healing rain starts falling across the land, curing the people of their Geostigma. Yazoo and Loz appear and confront Cloud; he charges at them, and they set off a massive explosion engulfing the three.|$|E

5|$|The Sun formed about 4.6 {{billion years}} ago from the {{collapse}} of part of a giant molecular <b>cloud</b> <b>that</b> consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars. This age is estimated using computer models of stellar evolution and through nucleocosmochronology. The result {{is consistent with the}} radiometric date of the oldest Solar System material, at 4.567 {{billion years ago}}. Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as iron-60, that form only in exploding, short-lived stars. This indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed. A shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the Sun by compressing the matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity. As one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also began to rotate because of conservation of angular momentum and heat up with the increasing pressure. Much of the mass became concentrated in the center, whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the planets and other Solar System bodies. Gravity and pressure within the core of the cloud generated a lot of heat as it accreted more matter from the surrounding disk, eventually triggering nuclear fusion. Thus, the Sun was born.|$|E
25|$|With highly {{unstable}} atmospheric conditions, large cumulus {{may continue}} to grow into cumulonimbus calvus (essentially a very tall congestus <b>cloud</b> <b>that</b> produces thunder), then ultimately into the species capillatus when supercooled water droplets {{at the top of}} the cloud turn into ice crystals giving it a cirriform appearance.|$|E

25|$|What {{is needed}} is a {{knowledge}} of the water content in the thunderstorm, the freezing level and the height of the summit of the precipitation. One way of calculating the water content is to transform the reflectivities in rain rate at all levels in the clouds and to sum it up. This is done by an algorithm called Vertically integrated liquid, or VIL. This value represent the total amount of liquid water in the <b>cloud</b> <b>that</b> is available. If the cloud would rain out completely, it would be the amount of rain falling on the ground and one can estimate with VIL the potential for flash flood.|$|E
25|$|An {{analysis}} {{published on}} 21 July 2014 based on observations by the ESO's Very Large Telescope in Chile concluded alternatively that the cloud, {{rather than being}} isolated, might be a dense clump within a continuous but thinner stream of matter, and would act as a constant breeze on the disk of matter orbiting the black hole, rather than sudden gusts that would have caused fireworks as they hit, as originally expected. Supporting this hypothesis, G1, a <b>cloud</b> <b>that</b> passed near the black hole 13 years ago, had an orbit almost identical to G2, consistent with both clouds, and a gas tail thought to be trailing G2, all being denser clumps within a large single gas stream.|$|E
