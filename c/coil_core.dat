A purposely designed probe has been realized, that allows the acquisition of the Barkhausen noise together with the magnetic induction flux experimented by the pick-up <b>coil</b> <b>core</b> plus the material under test. The basic idea is to support the BN analysis with information related to the hysteresis cycle; experimental results show how a multivariate approach {{can lead to a}} better resolution and repeatability...|$|E

The solid-state resonant topology will replace an existing pulse transformer and thyratron-based resonant modulator to supply the 60 -kV target potential for the ion acceleration of the On-Line Isotope Mass Separator ISOLDE accelerator. An experimental prototype is tested in order to validate the proposed concept, including a low auxiliary voltage power supply to compensate the losses in the circuit.

The reason for choosing magnetorquers {{as part of}} the attitude control systemis the reliability and the simple design. Air <b>core</b> <b>coils</b> were chosen, because we are able to optimizeand manufacture them ourselves. Ferrite <b>core</b> <b>coils</b> are more efficient regarding space and powerconsumption, but the optimization, calculation and production is much more complicated. So wedecided to keep it as simple and cost efficient as possible and use air <b>core</b> <b>coil</b> magnetorquers as ourprime active attitude control actuators. There will be three actuators oriented perpendicular toeach other. Through this orientation attitude control is possible regardless how the satellite isoriented to the magnetic field lines.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} use of a non-destructive, {{continuous}} magnetic Barkhausen noise (CMBN) technique to investigate the size and thickness of volumetric defects, in a 1070 steel. The magnetic behavior of the used probe was analyzed by numerical simulation, using the finite element method (FEM). Results indicated that the presence of a ferrite <b>coil</b> <b>core</b> in the probe favors MBN emissions. The samples were scanned with different speeds and probe configurations to determine the effect of the flaw on the CMBN signal amplitude. A moving smooth window, based on a second-order statistical moment, was used for analyzing the time signal. The results show the technique`s good repeatability, and high capacity for detection of this type of defect. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We used detergent and a protein denaturant to confirm the importance of the helical structure of the silk for heme coordination. Aqueous methanol treatment, which was used to stabilize the materials, transformed the low-spin, six-coordinate heme to a five-coordinate high-spin complex, thus providing a vacant site for ligand binding. The optimal aqueous methanol treatment time that simultaneously maintains the helical protein structure and stabilizes the silk material without substantial leaching of heme from the system was determined...|$|E
40|$|The {{annealing}} process {{is one of}} the important operations in production of cold rolled steel sheets, which significantly influences the final product quality of cold rolling mills.

Modelling of {{annealing process}} (prediction of heating and cooling time and trend prediction of <b>coil</b> <b>core</b> temperature) is a very sophisticated and expensive work. Modelling of annealing process can be done by using of thermal models. In this paper, Modelling of steel annealing process is proposed by using data mining techniques. The main advantages of modelling with data mining techniques are: high speed in data processing, acceptable accuracy in obtained results and simplicity in using of this method. In this paper, after comparison of results of some data mining techniques, feed forward back propagation neural network is applied for annealing process modelling. A good correlation between results of this method and results of thermal models has been obtained...|$|E

40|$|The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) {{will be a}} superconducting {{accelerator}} and collider to {{be installed}} in the existing underground LEP ring tunnel at CERN. It will provide proton-proton collisions with a centre of mass energy of 14 TeV. The proton beams coming from the SPS will be injected into the LHC at 450 GeV by vertically deflecting kicker magnets and horizontally deflecting steel septum magnets (MSI). The proton beams will be dumped from the LHC {{with the help of}} two extraction systems comprising horizontally deflecting kicker magnets and vertically deflecting steel septum magnets (MSD). The MSI and MSD septa are laminated iron-dominated magnets using an all welded construction. The yokes are constructed from two different half cores, called <b>coil</b> <b>core</b> and septum core.

40|$|Measurements {{have been}} made of various {{magnetic}} materials {{in order to improve}} the flux density at the SIS junction positions in the mixer. The materials measured are Hiperco 50 A, HyMu 80, Consumet iron and Magnet iron. Magnet iron is recommended for unannealed use. Consumet is recommended for annealed use. Hiperco 50 A can be used annealed if large hysteresis can be accepted. For highest flux density for lowest drive current, annealed Consumet should be used. Measurements In EDTN 190 [1], suggestions were made to increase the flux density at the junctions. These suggestions included increasing the diameter of the <b>coil</b> <b>core</b> (by a factor of 2), increasing the size of the cross arms at the joint with the core and tapering down {{to the size of the}} pole pieces, and using magnetic screws. Figure 1 shows the modified circuit which was used for the following measurements. The measurements are made by driving the maximum current through the coil and then decreasing the current to zero, increasing in the opposite direction to maximum, then reducing to zero again and then increasing to maximum in the original direction. All curves in this memo are taken in this manner, and the initial rise to maximum current is not shown for clarity. The materials tested are given in Table 1 [2].

50|$|A coil not {{containing}} a magnetic core is called an air <b>core.</b> This includes <b>coils</b> wound on a plastic or ceramic form {{in addition to}} those made of stiff wire that are self-supporting and have air inside them. Air <b>core</b> <b>coils</b> generally have a much lower inductance than similarly sized ferromagnetic <b>core</b> <b>coils,</b> but are used in radio frequency circuits to prevent energy losses called core losses that occur in magnetic cores. The absence of normal core losses permits a higher Q factor, so air <b>core</b> <b>coils</b> are used in high frequency resonant circuits, such as up to a few megahertz. However, losses such as proximity effect and dielectric losses are still present.

50|$|Closed-core {{transformers}} {{are constructed}} in 'core form' or 'shell form'. When windings surround the core, the transformer is core form; when windings {{are surrounded by}} the core, the transformer is shell form. Shell form design may be more prevalent than core form design for distribution transformer applications due to the relative ease in stacking the <b>core</b> around winding <b>coils.</b> <b>Core</b> form design tends to, as a general rule, be more economical, and therefore more prevalent, than shell form design for high voltage power transformer applications {{at the lower end}} of their voltage and power rating ranges (less than or equal to, nominally, 230 kV or 75 MVA). At higher voltage and power ratings, shell form transformers tend to be more prevalent. Shell form design tends to be preferred for extra-high voltage and higher MVA applications because, though more labor-intensive to manufacture, shell form transformers are characterized as having inherently better kVA-to-weight ratio, better short-circuit strength characteristics and higher immunity to transit damage.|$|R

40|$|A simple {{molecular}} mechanics {{model has}} been used to investigate optimal spool-like packing conformations of double-stranded DNA molecules in viral capsids with icosahedral symmetry. The model represents an elastic segmented chain by using one pseudoatom for each ten basepairs (roughly one turn of the DNA double helix). Force constants for the various terms in the energy function were chosen to approximate known physical properties, and a radial restraint was used to confine the DNA into a sphere with a volume corresponding to that of a typical bacteriophage capsid. When the DNA fills 90 % of the spherical volume, optimal packaging is obtained for coaxially spooled models, but this result does not hold when the void volume is larger. When only 60 % of the spherical volume is filled with DNA, the lowest energy structure has two layers, with a <b>coiled</b> <b>core</b> packed at an angle to an outer coaxially spooled shell. This relieves bending strain associated with tight curvature near the poles in a model with 100 % coaxial spooling.
