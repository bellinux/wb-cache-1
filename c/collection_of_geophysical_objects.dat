50|$|Geophysical {{survey is}} the {{systematic}} <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>geophysical</b> data for spatial studies. Detection and analysis <b>of</b> the <b>geophysical</b> signals forms the core <b>of</b> <b>Geophysical</b> signal processing. The magnetic and gravitational fields {{emanating from the}} Earth's interior hold essential information concerning seismic activities and the internal structure. Hence, detection {{and analysis of the}} electric and Magnetic fields is very crucial. As the Electromagnetic and gravitational waves are multi-dimensional signals, all the 1-D transformation techniques can be extended for the analysis of these signals as well. Hence this article also discusses multi-dimensional signal processing techniques.|$|R
40|$|International audienceStrong intermittency {{as well as}} spatial {{heterogeneity}} {{characterize the}} brittle deformation <b>of</b> <b>geophysical</b> <b>objects</b> such as the Earth's crust or the Arctic sea-ice cover. They can be expressed through specific scaling laws, that relate, for a space-time domain, (a) the number of earthquakes or (b) the strain rate, vs. {{the size of the}} domain, for the Earth's crust or the Arctic sea ice, respectively. However, in both cases, spatial (respectively temporal) scaling depends on the time (respectively spatial) scale considered, i. e., the space and time scaling dependences are coupled. Here, we show that this space-time coupling of brittle deformation at geophysical scales can be summarized through a unique scaling law characterizing the discrete fracturing events (earthquakes or displacement events along sea-ice leads). As suggested by an analysis of southern Californian seismicity, we argue that this space-time coupling is likely to emerge from the complex correlation patterns related to chain triggering of earth- or ice-quakes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{critical}} point hypothesis for fracture is tested using a progressive damage model. The {{advantage of the}} present model, based on continuum mechanics, {{is the possibility of}} tracking the approach to final failure in terms either of discrete events (the avalanches) or of the resulting continuous strain field. Different but actually closely linked phenomena are reported. In terms of damage avalanches, power law distributions of avalanche sizes and energies are observed associated with a finite size scaling. The finite size scaling is also observed for the spatial correlations of damage events. A divergence of the correlation length is reported in the vicinity of final failure, from a correlation analysis of discrete events and from a scaling analysis of the continuous strain rate field. We also show that multifractal properties of the deformation emerge from the long-range elastic interactions that occur near final failure. All of these results argue for a {{critical point}} interpretation of failure. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the criticality of fracture and deformation <b>of</b> <b>geophysical</b> <b>objects,</b> and for associated precursory phenomena...|$|R

We focus mainly on unforced {{variability in the}} troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. In addition to atmosphere-only modes, our scope also includes coupled modes, in which the atmosphere interacts with the other components of the Earth system, such as the ocean, hydrosphere, and cryosphere. The topics covered include turbulence on time scales of seconds and minutes, gravity waves on time scales of hours, weather systems on time scales of days, atmospheric blocking on time scales of weeks, the Madden–Julian Oscillation on time scales of months, the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation and El Niño–Southern Oscillation on time scales of years, and the North Atlantic, Arctic, Antarctic, Pacific Decadal, and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillations on time scales of decades.

40|$|Factors {{contributing}} to the historic flooding along the Lena River in May 2001 are examined using a <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>geophysical</b> data sets for the pan-Arctic region. This framework <b>of</b> <b>geophysical</b> data, model simulations, and analytic tools has been developed to study the regional- and continental-scale Arctic hydrology {{in an effort to}} quantify the flux of freshwater to the Arctic Ocean. Contributing factors in this catastrophic flooding were the anomalously high snowfall {{in the southern part of}} the basin following a winter of extreme cold. Rapid warming in early May, with air temperatures of over 20 °C early in the melt season produced excessive snowmelt and runoff in the southern headwaters of the basin. Ice jams, with anomalously high ice thicknesses following the extreme cold exacerbated the rise in water stage near the cities of Lensk and Yakutsk. Recently obtained discharge records for several subbasins with the most severe flooding are compared with modeled values from the pan-Arctic Water Balance Model. Areas most susceptible to flooding are determined by utilizing landscape slope as a proxy for channel and floodplain morphology. Our analysis illustrates the convergence of hydroclimatic and landscape factors that led to extreme flooding across parts of this region. This study also sheds light on our ability to produce accurate estimates of the land-to-ocean freshwater fluxes...|$|R

The Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic Ocean is in contrast virtually unstudied. Therefore the major conclusion of the Arctic Ocean workshop was that studies of the Gakkel Ridge should have highest priority. The Gakkel Ridge is perhaps not only the most important arctic target but also the most important world-wide ridge target {{as it is in}} many respects unique in the global spreading system and represents an end-member for testing many models of ridge processes, both geological and biological. The following is a list of the first-order scientific aims for the Gakkel Ridge program: A reconnaissance (30 - 50 km sample spacing) sampling of volcanics, sediments and biology along the Gakkel Ridge.

40|$|International audienceTemperate glaciers are an {{indicator}} of the local effects of global climate change. For economical and security reasons in the surrounding areas, the monitoring <b>of</b> those <b>geophysical</b> <b>objects</b> is being a necessity. SAR data are expected to provide dense measurements of physical parameters which are necessary to detect significant changes and to constrain glacier flow models. In this paper, five descending one-day ERS- 1 / 2 tandem interferometric data pairs from July 1995 to April 1996 are studied in the Chamonix Mont-Blanc area (French Alps). This multi-temporal interferogram series is used to analyse the coherence levels and fringe patterns over nine glaciers. Moreover, when the coherence is sufficient, Differential SAR Interferometry (D-InSAR) processing are applicable to derive a three-dimensional (3 -D) velocity fields. An expert knowledge and a ten years measurements analysis of glacier flow are used to fix the line of sight (LOS) displacement offset. Finally, an analysis of the wrapped phase difference between interferograms is exposed to detect the presence of residual topographic fringes and to characterize the surface flow field evolution...|$|R
40|$|This book {{contains}} a detailed presentation of general principles of sensitivity analysis {{as well as}} their applications to sample cases of remote sensing experiments. An emphasis is made on applications of adjoint problems, because they are more efficient in many practical cases, although their formulation may seem counterintuitive to a beginner. Special attention is paid to forward problems based on higher-order partial differential equations, where a novel matrix operator approach to formulation of corresponding adjoint problems is presented. Sensitivity analysis (SA) serves for quantitative models of physical objects the same purpose, as differential calculus does for functions. SA provides derivatives of model output parameters (observables) with respect to input parameters. In remote sensing SA provides computer-efficient means to compute the jacobians, matrices of partial derivatives of observables with respect to the <b>geophysical</b> parameters <b>of</b> interest. The jacobians are used to solve corresponding inverse problems of remote sensing. They also play an important role already while designing the remote sensing experiment, where they are used to estimate the retrieval uncertainties <b>of</b> the <b>geophysical</b> parameters with given measurement errors of the instrument, thus providing means for formulations of corresponding requirements to the specific remote sensing instrument. If the quantitative models <b>of</b> <b>geophysical</b> <b>objects</b> can be formulated in an analytic form, then sensitivity analysis is reduced to differential calculus. But in most cases, the practical geophysical models used in remote sensing are based on numerical solutions of forward problems - differential equations with initial and/or boundary conditions. As a result, these models cannot be formulated in an analytic form and this is where the methods of SA become indispensable. This book isintended for a wide audience. The beginners in remote sensing could use it as a single source, covering key issues of SA, from general principles, through formulation of corresponding linearized and adjoint problems, to practical applications to uncertainty analysis and inverse problems in remote sensing. The experts, already active in the field, may find useful the alternative formulations of some key issues of SA, for example, use of individual observables, instead of a widespread use of the cumulative cost function. The book also {{contains a}}n overview of author's matrix operator approach to formulation of adjoint problems for forward problems based on the higher-order partial differential equations. This approach still awaits its publication in the periodic literature and thus may be of interest to readership across all levels of expertise...|$|R
40|$|Typical {{geophysical}} inversion {{problems are}} ill-posed, non-linear and non-unique. Sometimes {{the problem is}} trans-dimensional, where the number of unknown parameters {{is one of the}} unknowns, which makes the inverse problem even more challenging. Detecting the shape <b>of</b> a <b>geophysical</b> <b>object</b> underneath the earth surface from gravity anomaly is one of such complex problems, where the number of geometrical parameters is one of the unknowns. To deal with the difficulties of non-uniqueness, ill-conditioning and nonlinearity, a statistical Bayesian model inference approach is adopted. A reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm is proposed to overcome the difficulty of trans-dimensionality. Carefully designed within-model and between-model Markov chain moves are implemented to reduce the rate of generating inadmissible geometries, thus achieving good overall efficiency in the Monte Carlo sampler. Numerical experiments on a 2 -D problem show that the proposed algorithm is capable of obtaining satisfactory solutions with quantifiable uncertainty to a challenging trans-dimensional geophysical inverse problem. Solutions from RJMCMC appear to be parsimonious for the given prior, in the sense that among the models satisfactorily represent the true model, models with higher posterior probabilities tend to have fewer number of parameters. The proposed numerical algorithm can be readily adapted to other similar trans-dimensional geophysical inverse applications.

40|$|Objects {{in nature}} are often very irregular, so that, within the {{constraints}} of Euclidean geometry, one is forced to approximate their shape grossly. A rock fragment, for example, is treated as being spherical, and a coastline straight or smoothly curved. Upon examination, however, these objects {{are found to be}} jagged, and their jaggedness does not diminish when viewed at ever finer scales. In his monumental work, Mandelbrot (1982) developed and popularized fractal geometry, a geometry that applies to many irregular natural objects. The analytical techniques for treating fractal geometry and their inter-relationships have undergone rapid development and broad application (Feder, 1988). Fractal geometry has been applied to a wide variety <b>of</b> geological and <b>geophysical</b> <b>objects</b> and phenomena: for surveys see Scholz and Mandelbrot (1989), Turcotte (1989), Turcotte (1992)), and Barton and La Pointe (1995). During this same time, there have also been revolutionary developments in understanding the types of physical processes that produce patterns described by fractal geometry. Fractal patterns have been found to arise {{from a wide variety of}} nonlinear dynamical systems, particularly those that exhibit certain types of chaotic behavior (e. g., Schuster, 1988). Examples are dissipative systems with many degrees of freedom that show self-organized criticality, such as avalanches on the surface of a sand pile and earthquakes (Bak et al., 1988; Bak and Chen, 1991) ...|$|R

40|$|Statistical {{independence}} {{is one of}} the most desirable properties of a coordinate system for representing and modeling images. In reality, however, truly independent coordinates may not exist for a given set of images, or it may be too di$cult to compute them in practice. Therefore, we propose a new method to rapidly compute the least statistically dependent basis (LSDB) from a basis dictionary (e. g., the local cosine or wavelet packet dictionaries) containing a huge number of orthonormal (or biorthogonal) bases. Our new basis selection criterion is minimization of the mutual information of the distributions of the basis coe$cients as a measure of statistical dependence, which in turn is equivalent to minimization of the sum of the di!erential entropy of each coordinate in the basis dictionary. In this sense, we can view this LSDB algorithm as the best-basis version of the Independent Component Analysis (ICA), which is increasingly gaining popularity. This criterion is di!erent from that of the Joint Best Basis (JBB) proposed by Wickerhauser, which can be viewed as the best-basis version of the Karhunen}Loève basis (KLB).
