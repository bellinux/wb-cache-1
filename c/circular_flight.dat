25|$|Receptive {{females are}} the ones to locate male territories by {{examining}} tree-falls or large light gaps within their foraging ranges. Female E. imperialis behavior, when entering a territory, initially resembles that of an intruding male. The female flies up within 5cm of the resident male and hovers until the male flies out to investigate. The male and female then engage in a tight <b>circular</b> <b>flight</b> path, less than 20cm apart, until the female lands on the perch of the tree. The female then presses its body close to the tree trunk, with its wings held down. The male then lands on her dorsum to copulate with the female, which lasts a brief 5 seconds. After mating, the female then immediately leaves the territory. It {{is also important to}} note that mating only occurs in relatively solitary territories in which no other males are present. It is theorized that female E. imperialis possibly only mate once in their lifetime {{due to the fact that}} a very limited number of female foraging ranges actually overlap with any given male territory.|$|E

Aerial survey techniques have varied over the years; however, they have generally followed the techniques used by the author since 1991.

50|$|Some male wood thrushes {{arrive at}} the {{breeding}} grounds several days before the earliest females while other males {{arrive at the}} same time as the females, establishing territories ranging in size from 0.08 to 0.8 hectares (one-fifth of an acre to two acres). The female typically leads silent <b>circular</b> <b>flights</b> 1 - 1.8 m from the ground, with the male chasing. Six or more flights generally take place in succession. The pairs will perch together and feed each other in between flights. The male begins to sing at dawn and dusk a few days after arriving at breeding grounds. Early in the breeding season, the male sings from high perches in the tallest trees, but as the season progresses, it sings somewhat shorter and less elaborate songs from lower perches. Each day's singing begins and is most intense just before sunrise. The male may sing throughout the day but especially at dusk. The song season is usually over by the end of July.|$|R
2500|$|Louis Blériot {{established}} his first flying school at Etampes near Rouen in 1909.

5000|$|Smithornis {{are known}} for the rare ability to make sound with their wings.

The behavior may be related to courtship; the male produces the sound while flashing a white patch on its back when females are present. The sound is made by all species of Smithornis; in S. capensis both sexes perform the behavior, but in S. rufolateralis only the male does so.|$|E
40|$|The "Cooperative Airborne Radiometer for Ocean and Land Studies" (CAROLS) L-Band {{radiometer}} {{was designed}} and built as {{a copy of the}} EMIRAD II radiometer constructed by the Technical University of Denmark team.

It is installed on board a dedicated French ATR 42 research aircraft, in conjunction with other airborne instruments (C-Band scatterometer [...] STORM, the GOLD-RTR GPS system, the infrared CIMEL radiometer and a visible wavelength camera). Following initial laboratory qualifications, three airborne campaigns involving 21 flights were carried out over South West France, the Valencia site and the Bay of Biscay (Atlantic Ocean) in 2007, 2008 and 2009, in coordination with in situ field campaigns. In order to validate the CAROLS data, various aircraft flight patterns and maneuvers were implemented, including straight horizontal <b>flights,</b> <b>circular</b> <b>flights,</b> wing and nose wags over the ocean. Analysis of the first two campaigns in 2007 and 2008 leads us to improve the CAROLS radiometer regarding isolation between channels and filter bandwidth.

5000|$|The chinspot batis is not {{normally}} sociable {{and is usually}} encountered singly or in pairs.

Chinspot batises are territorial throughout the year, defending an area of around 5 ha which the male advertises with a descending three note whistle from a prominent perch, the female may join the mail in a duet. This call is made in a head up posture, exposing the conspicuous white throat. In higher intensity territorial displays the male flies around in short <b>circular</b> <b>flights</b> above the canopy in a jerking, jinky flight with his rump fluffed out, his head held up and making frog like calls, whistling and fripping his wings.

50|$|Since {{the wind}} was less {{reliable}} than in Kitty Hawk and also because re-laying the launch rail to suit the wind direction was laborious, in September they began using a catapult to accelerate the aircraft to the speed necessary for takeoff. This used a falling weight suspended from a 16 ft high derrick, with a block and tackle to multiply the distance that the aircraft was pulled. Using this apparatus Wilbur made his first turn in the air on 15 September, and on September 20 he succeeded in flying a complete circle, covering 4080 ft in 1 minute 16 seconds. This flight was witnessed by Amos Root, who published {{an account of the}} flight in the January 1, 1905 issue of Gleanings in Bee Culture, a trade magazine he published. On 14 October Orville made his first <b>circular</b> <b>flight</b> and the following day Octave Chanute arrived to view the Wright brother's progress. Unfortunately Orville, attempting another circular fight, was unable to straighten out and was forced to land the aircraft at high speed after only 30 seconds in the air, damaging the skids and propellers. A series of flights ending in damage to the aircraft followed, but the run of bad luck ended on November 9, when Wilbur flew four circuits of Huffman Prairie, staying in the air for five minutes and only landing because the engine was beginning to overheat. On 1 December Orville made a similar flight, and on 9 December they stopped flying for the year.|$|E
5000|$|This species {{primarily}} mates via the lek system, {{in which}} there are aggregations of males on small mating territories. When the female reaches the lek, she changes her behavior so that she helps the males to detect her by performing a long and obvious <b>circular</b> <b>flight.</b> The species operates on a polygynous system in which one male has the ability to mate with several females in one breeding season. In Papilio glaucus, that which is of the same genus of this species, the lack of male-male competition, strong rapid flight, dispersed abundant food, and oviposition sights helped to support the idea of mating system based on polygyny. [...] The females are prevented from mating with other males when the male emits a sphragis,which prevents other males from mating with the female, ensuring that only the sperm from this male fertilizes the eggs. The physical act of copulation takes between one half hour to two hours. During this time, the male spermatophore is transferred to the female's bursa. The spermatophore is then absorbed and its nutrient (protein) contents are given to the female's eggs as a food source. [...] For this reason, the male makes an indirect investment to his offspring, given that he offers them a food source, being beneficial to the female given that she risks less of her own well-being to bear her offspring. Therefore, a male is considered more fit with a larger ejaculation, given that he allows his offspring to feed so that his own genes may be passed on efficiently.|$|E

40|$|Pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus) are unusual among vespertilionids (the {{most common}} and diverse family of bats in {{temperate}} regions of the world) in that they often emit a loud, partially audible social call several times in rapid succession while in flight. This social call appears {{to function as a}} contact call in that it is frequently given when bats return from foraging and perform <b>circular</b> <b>flights</b> before entering a crevice roost. In this dissertation, I examine the functional and social significance of this calling behavior by free-flying pallid bats in central Oregon using a combination of observations, audio recordings, audio playbacks, acoustic analysis, and genetic marker analysis. In chapter 1, I found that bats respond to the calls of conspecifics and that call structure is unique to individuals and stable through time, which makes these calls well-suited for roostmate recognition. In chapter 2, I found significant genetic structure among colonies based on sequence variation at the mitochondrial DNA control region but very little structure among colonies for nuclear microsatellites. These data are indicative of female philopatry with male-mediated gene flow and highlight the potential that calls may function in the maintenance of multigenerational social groups. Finally, in chapter 3, I utilized genetic markers to investigate relatedness among individuals sharing a roost {{and the extent to which}} call variation encodes information about relatedness to examine whether calling behavior may assist in maintaining social bonds as individuals switch roosts. I found that while average colony relatedness was low, bats roost with a greater proportion of relatives than expected by chance. In addition, I found that contact call structure encodes information about matrilineal relationship and relatedness as well as individual identity. Overall, these results suggest that calling behavior in pallid bats is important in maintaining social structure at maternity roosts. Given the high roost lability and nocturnal environment of pallid bats, this study offers important insight into how animals in fluid societies mediate interactions with groupmates using acoustic signals...|$|R
