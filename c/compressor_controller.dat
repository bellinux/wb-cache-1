This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} operating a 4 K pulse tube cryocooler using an inverterdriven compressor. The cryocooler is a Cryomech model PT 410. By adjusting the power frequency of the inverter compressor from 46 to 70 Hz, the cryocooler can offer 22 W to 43 W at 45 K on the first stage and 0. 5 W to 1. 1 W at 4. 2 K on the 2 nd stage; for this range, the compressor input power changes from 5. 0 kW to 8. 6 kW. Dynamic operation of the 4 K pulse tube cryocooler has been successfully demonstrated using a liquid helium cryostat. The <b>compressor</b> <b>controller</b> maintained the desired cryostat temperature by adjusting the power frequency to reduce the cooling capacity of the pulse tube cooler at 4 K, and resulted in less compressor input power...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel strategy for implementing model predictive control (MPC) {{to a large}} gas turbine power plant {{as a part of}} our research progress in order to improve plant thermal efficiency and load–frequency control performance. A generalized state space model for a large gas turbine covering the whole steady operational range is designed according to subspace identification method with closed loop data as input to the identification algorithm. Then the model is used in developing a MPC and integrated into the plant existing control strategy. The strategy principle is based on feeding the reference signals of the pilot valve, natural gas valve, and the compressor pressure ratio controller with the optimized decisions given by the MPC instead of direct application of the control signals. If the set points for the <b>compressor</b> <b>controller</b> and turbine valves are sent in a timely manner, there will be more kinetic energy in the plant to release faster responses on the output and the overall system efficiency is improved. Simulation results have illustrated the feasibility of the proposed application that has achieved significant improvement in the frequency variations and load following capability which are also translated to be improvements in the overall combined cycle thermal efficiency of around 1.1  % compared to the existing one.|$|E

40|$|This annual {{progress}} report describes the third year's technical progress in a three-year program. This report introduces the benefits of improved surge detection and summarizes {{what is known about}} internal flows as surge precursors in centrifugal compressors. Early research results and findings concerning surge in centrifugal compressors and possible precursors to surge are presented. Laboratory test results in modern compressors with 3 D impellers are described in detail and used to show the changes in internal flow patterns that occur as a compressor approaches surge. It was found that older compressors with recessed impeller blading (2 D geometry) {{do not have the same}} accessible flow patterns. The laboratory test results indicate a large increase in potential operating range for modern compressors. This annual report also presents results from the field testing conducted during the course of this third year. The field test results showed similar changes in the surge probe strain signals and the same type, although of less magnitude, of indication that the compressor is approaching surge. An algorithm for identifying the nearness of surge has been proposed and evaluated with the available data. This project is co-funded by the Gas Machinery Research Council (GMRC) and by Siemens Energy and Automation (Siemens). The results of the project include a step-by-step process for design, sizing, and installation of surge detection probes and for implementation of the direct surge control in centrifugal <b>compressor</b> <b>controllers.</b> This work is considered a step towards the successful implementation of direct surge control for improved flexibility and efficiency in natural gas transmission compressors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Dealing with high-dimensional input spaces, like visual in-put, is a {{challenging}} task for reinforcement learning (RL). Neuroevolution (NE), used for continuous RL problems, has to either reduce the prob-lem dimensionality by (1) compressing {{the representation of}} the neural network controllers or (2) employing a pre-processor (compressor) that transforms the high-dimensional raw inputs into low-dimensional fea-tures. In this paper we extend the approach in [16]. The Max-Pooling Convolutional Neural Network (MPCNN) compressor is evolved online, maximizing the distances between normalized feature vectors computed from the images collected by the recurrent neural network (RNN) con-trollers during their evaluation in the environment. These two interleaved evolutionary searches are used to find MPCNN <b>compressors</b> and RNN <b>controllers</b> that drive a race car in the TORCS racing simulator using only visual input...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} focused on the control of air-feed system of Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC). This system regulates the air {{entering}} in the cathode side of the fuel cell. The control objective is to maintain optimum net power output by regulating the oxygen excess ratio in its operating range, through the air <b>compressor.</b> This requires <b>controllers</b> with a fast response time in order to avoid oxygen starvation during load changes. The problem is addressed using a robust nonlinear second order sliding mode controller in cascaded structure. The controller is based on sub-optimal algorithm, which is known for its robustness under disturbances and uncertainties. The controller performance is validated through Hardware- In-Loop (HIL) simulation based on a commercial twin screw air compressor and a real time fuel cell emulation system. The simulation results show that the controller is robust and has a good transient performance under load variations and parametric uncertainties...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} utilizing a neural network as a controller for controlling a variable-speed air conditioner. An inverter is used for varying {{the speed of the}} <b>compressor</b> motor. The <b>controller</b> is a feedforward neural network with two nonlinear hidden layers. A model reference technique with the standard back-propagation adaptation rule is used for training the controller. The reference model is selected such that the control system has the settling time of 50 seconds. The control results are satisfactory. The responses of the neural network control system are {{similar to that of the}} model reference as required. Moreover, we compare between the consumption of energy in the neural network control system and that in a conventional fixed speed system. Without consideration of the efficiency of the inverter, the neural network control system consumes less energy than the fixed speed system by approximately 17 %.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the use of {{feedback}} control to eliminate the problems of hysteresis and surge associated with axial-flow compressors. We present a dynamic feedback controller that semiglobally stabilizes every rotating stall equilibrium, and a range of axisymmetric equilibria of the Moore-Greitzer model for axial-flow <b>compressors.</b> The dynamic <b>controller</b> combines a two-state-feedback back-stepping controller from the literature with a nonlinear high-gain observer that estimates the mass flow through the compressor from measurements of the pressure rise across it. Given an equilibrium and a compact inner bound on the domain of attraction, we use Lyapunov techniques to compute an explicit lower bound on the observer gain such that the specified equilibrium is asymptotically stable for the closed-loop system with a domain of attraction that contains the specified inner bound. Simulation results are used to demonstrate that the closed-loop compressor does not exhibit hysteresis and surge oscillations even in response to large and sudden changes in the throttle setting...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a procedure {{to measure the}} transient effects in a fuel cell air delivery system. These methods were applied to model the 20 kW automotive fuel cell system {{that was used in}} Animul H 2, a fuel cell-battery hybrid sedan developed by a group of engineering students at Virginia Tech.

40|$|A solar powered vapor {{compression}} {{refrigeration system}} is made practicable with thermal storage and novel control techniques. In one embodiment, the refrigeration system includes a photovoltaic panel, a variable speed compressor, an insulated enclosure, and a thermal reservoir. The photovoltaic (PV) panel converts sunlight into DC (direct current) electrical power. The DC electrical power drives a compressor that circulates refrigerant through a vapor compression refrigeration loop to extract {{heat from the}} insulated enclosure. The thermal reservoir is situated inside the insulated enclosure and includes a phase change material. As heat is extracted from the insulated enclosure, the phase change material is frozen, and thereafter is able {{to act as a}} heat sink to maintain the temperature of the insulated enclosure in the absence of sunlight. The conversion of solar power into stored thermal energy is optimized by a compressor control method that effectively maximizes the compressor's usage of available energy. A capacitor is provided to smooth the power voltage and to provide additional current during <b>compressor</b> start-up. A <b>controller</b> monitors the rate of change of the smoothed power voltage to determine if the compressor is operating below or above the available power maximum, and adjusts the compressor speed accordingly. In this manner, the compressor operation is adjusted to convert substantially all available solar power into stored thermal energy...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Computer and Electronical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) is a graphite-moderated, helium-cooled reactor {{that uses}} the Brayton direct gas cycle to convert the heat, which is {{generated}} in the core by nuclear fission. The heat is transferred to the coolant gas (helium), and converted into electrical energy {{by means of a}} gas turbo-generator. The Pebble Bed Micro Model (PBMM) is a model that was developed to demonstrate the operation of the closed, recuperative three-shaft Brayton cycle in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of its dynamic behaviour and to demonstrate the control strategies that will eventually be used in the PBMR. It is also used to demonstrate the ability of Flownex to simulate the integrated performance of the cycle. Flownex is a general-purpose thermal-fluid network analysis code. It solves the flow, pressure and temperature distribution in large unstructured thermal-fluid networks and provides the engineer or designer with essential information about the interaction between network components. Flownex can handle a wide variety of network components such as pipes, pumps, orifices, heat exchangers, <b>compressors,</b> turbines, <b>controllers</b> and valves. A complete Flownex model of the PBMM exists and will be used throughout the entire project. The start-up and shutdown sequences of the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) is characterised by numerous checks and control actions that occur in a very specific order. This order of events and continuous checking of important system parameters are intuitively based on rules that inherently describe the safe and preferred operating region of the plant. Presently most of the sequences and actions are performed by an expert who knows the system very well. Some of the sequences and actions are controlled by simple controllers and are only activated by the operator. A need therefore exists to capture the different control events of the start-up and shutdown sequences in a control model or method. A control model or method was developed to control the start-up and shutdown sequence of the PBMM model in Flownex. The control method was implemented in SIMULINK® as there is an existing interface between Flownex and SIMULINK®. The control method directly controls the procedures of start-up and shutdown through the Flownex/ SIMULINK® interface. The most important system parameters are monitored and adjustments are automatically made by the control method in response to system changes. A graphical user interface allows a user to manually activate start-up and shutdown. The aim of the project is to develop a controller that can control the PBMM through start-up as well as shutdown. Special emphasis is placed on critical transitions and pressure considerations due to the control of the start-up blower system rotational speed. The project establishes expertise in the control of the start-up and shutdown sequence of the PBMM in Flownex. Flownex was successfully used as a modelling platform to simulate the normal and dynamic operation of the PBMM. Identification of start-up and shutdown was a result of investigating the start-up and shutdown checklist documents as well as a detailed consideration of data captured by the PBMM. A control method was implemented in SIMULINK® and controls start-up and shutdown through the Flownex/SIMULINK® interface. A graphical user interface allows in time system changes by a user. Data captured by the simulation model was evaluated against data captured from the real system. Master...|$|R
30|$|In recent years, gas {{turbines}} (GT) have easily reached a primary position in {{thermal power generation}} field because of their fast deliveries of power and availability of natural gas (NG) (Rayaprolu 2009). GT as simple cycle or integrated with {{heat recovery steam generator}} (HRSG) to form a combined cycle (CC) power plant has become very popular generation technology in many countries. However, the manufacturers of such devices are doing great effort to achieve improved efficiencies and lower pollutant emissions that compete coal and clean coal technologies. Nowadays, apart from reliability and fuel cost optimization, novel power generation techniques demand much improved load demand tracking that lead to lessen frequency variations of power system with better corresponding plant efficiency. It has been noticed that improving the operation performance of gas turbine can significantly lead to higher cycle efficiency and better dynamic performance. Achieving better compressing ratios and maintaining the exhausted gas temperature within certain limits despite load stochastic variations is likely to do just that improvement. In the developed countries, it is, however, reported that the efficiency of CC power plants from 1960 to 2000 has been improved from 35  % up to nearly 60  % respectively (Rayaprolu 2009). In general, the literature of thermal power plants has often suggested optimal and predictive control theories that meet wide acceptance in industry and power plants (Lee and Ramirez 2001). In particular, some articles has been written and published on CC power plants’ control that sought to optimize combined cycle power plants with regard to efficiency and load following capability (Saez et al. 2007; Matsumoto et al. 1996; Lalor et al. 2005). A fuzzy predictive control based on genetic algorithms for power plant {{gas turbines}} is developed which provides the optimal dynamic set point for the regulatory level with contribution to capturing the nonlinearity of the plant (Saez et al. 2007). Start-up process optimization by an expert system has been proposed under NOx emission regulation and management of machine life (Matsumoto et al. 1996). The influence of gas turbine short-term dynamics on the performance of frequency control can also be investigated through suitable modelling for knowledge of frequency excursions in the grid in advance (Lalor et al. 2005). However, there are other important factors that have a direct influence on the system output performance and the grid frequency, which are studied in this paper and not considered in many papers. For instance, in the previous literature the emphasis of fuel flow changes was given only to the valve position of natural gas (NG); however, the position of pilot gas valve can also be manipulated to stabilize the flames in the premix and ensure steady combustion at all time. In addition, the compressor pressure ratio signal (the ratio of the discharged pressure of the compressor to the inlet atmospheric pressure) passes through the <b>compressor</b> pressure limit <b>controller</b> to influence the inlet guide vane (IGV) pitch controller which in turn affects the combustion process and flow of air to the GT. If the system automation is upgraded with potential to correct such signals by the MPC, these signals will optimize in advance which means reduced process variations while keeping faster load following capability due to higher stored/kinetic energy in the plant. This also can make the CCGT works close to its optimum efficiency by expanding the pressure ratio and the firing temperature by MPC. These potent motivations have to be investigated on gas turbines through advanced technique of system identification and control system design. However, without digital simulation, the gap between theory and practice cannot be easily bridged in this task. A model has been developed and verified via identification technique which is assessed and published in our research (Mohamed et al. 2015). The scientific contribution added to this paper is to integrate MPC to the developed identified model representing the real GT with emphasis on the strategic influences discussed above for the target of performance enhancement. The present paper is organized as follows. “Combined (deterministic/stochastic) subspace identification” section clarifies the technique of subspace identification. “The application of subspace identification to gas turbine process” section discusses the developed model of real gas turbine by subspace identification method for different operating regions. Simulation results of identification and verification procedure have shown model accuracy and capability of reflecting the key variables of the turbine. “Predictive controller design and implementation” section presents the designed model predictive control to be applied to the system. “Simulation results” section then mentions simulation scenarios that have offered the advantage of the proposed upgraded strategy. Finally, the present paper has concluded the work with suggested further opportunities for future research.|$|R
