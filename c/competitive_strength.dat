40|$|Includes bibliographyThis article {{argues that}} the local and {{regional}} governments of Latin America, in an increasingly globalized world, must face new challenges that include establishing or improving their <b>competitive</b> <b>strengths</b> and transforming their local production systems. These two aspects must be linked to territorial policies and, more specifically, {{to the development of}} a territorial culture that embraces both. While it is true that enterprises are the ones that actually compete, their competitiveness may be enhanced if the territorial environment encourages this dynamic and if they themselves realize the importance of being enterprises "of the territory" rather than "in the territory". This objective may be thwarted, however, by the existence of territories that are unequally prepared to meet these challenges. Different types of intervention need to be used, therefore, in terms of local and regional policies, to enhance the <b>competitive</b> <b>strengths</b> of such territories. ...|$|R

40|$|Is Polish {{manufacturing}} {{prepared for}} integration with the European single market? Does it have sufficient capacity {{to cope with}} the competitive pressures within the Union? Integration theory indicates that adaptability to the single market depends on a country's ability to accumulate and re-deploy resources rapidly in pursuit of new opportunities, {{while at the same time}} fully exploiting existing <b>competitive</b> <b>strengths.</b> Accumulation of resources was very successful in the majority of industries at the beginning of transformation and then dramatically deteriorated in the second half of the nineties. It may suggest that Poland was losing its ability to accumulate resources in manufacturing on the eve of accession. The speed of structural change in manufacturing has been increasing over the whole decade, indicating a high degree of industrial mobility of the Polish economy.

40|$|AbstractClumped {{dispersal}} of species {{is a widespread}} phenomenon in nature, however its relevance for structuring communities and maintaining biodiversity is not well understood. We used a spatially explicit simulation model to assess the effects of clumped compared to non-clumped dispersal on the diversity of a model community of sessile species. The species differed {{only in terms of}} their mean dispersal distance. Neither trade-offs between dispersal and local <b>competitive</b> <b>strengths</b> nor differences in these <b>competitive</b> <b>strengths</b> were assumed. We investigated spatially homogeneous, heterogeneous and temporally fluctuating environments. In all cases clumped dispersal allowed the long-term coexistence of a variety of species in contrast to non-clumped dispersal. In particular, clumped dispersal was found to decouple the mechanism of spatial clustering and thus recruitment variation or limitation from the dispersal distance. This supports species coexistence even in environments where local non-clumped dispersal was a superior or inferior dispersal strategy. Clumping is an attribute of {{dispersal of}}fering new possibilities for trade-offs with life-history traits and with the dispersal distance itself...|$|R

50|$|A sports {{rating system}} {{is a system that}} {{analyzes}} the results of sports competitions to provide ratings for each team or player. Common systems include polls of expert voters, crowdsourcing non-expert voters, betting markets, and computer systems.

Rankings, or power rankings, can be directly provided (e.g., by asking people to rank teams), or can be derived by sorting each team's ratings and assigning an ordinal rank to each team, so that the highest rated team earns the #1 rank. Rating systems provide an alternative to traditional sports standings which are based on win-loss-tie ratios.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper studies {{if there}} are {{associations}} between export profiles of some Spanish companies –high or low export intensity- and the opinion of managers about strengths generated in the marketing mix. Design/methodology: Through a questionnaire to 64 export Spanish companies and the literature review, we defined the export intensity as the dependent variable. The explanatory variables used measure the importance granted by the companies to the different variables of the marketing mix as strengths for export activity. We used MANOVA method as it lets us analyze differences between two or more metrical dependent variables (quality, price, promotion and place) based on a mix of categorical variables that act like predictors (export volume). Findings: Our results indicate that a correct planning of the marketing strategy is a key aspect inside internationalization strategy. In contrast with other studies that analyze specific strategies within marketing mix, this research focuses on these as perceived <b>competitive</b> <b>strengths,</b> whichever the mix of variable strategy that generates these strengths is. Practical implications: The differences observed indicate that there are different patterns in the marketing mix strength evaluation. The {{results show that the}} firms which have the most export intensity have generated bigger capacities especially in distribution channels configuration and promotion strategies.
