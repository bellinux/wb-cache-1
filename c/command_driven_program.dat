40|$|XPI is a table driven {{parameter}} interface which greatly simplifies both {{command driven}} {{programs such as}} BROWSE and XIMAGE as well as stand alone single-task programs. It moves all of the syntax and semantic parsing of commands and parameters out of the users code into common code and externally defined tables. This allows the programmer to concentrate on writing the code unique to the application rather than reinventing the user interface and for external graphical interfaces to interface with no changes to the <b>command</b> <b>driven</b> <b>program.</b> XPI also includes a compatibility library which allows programs written using the IRAF host interface (Mandel and Roll) to use XPI {{in place of the}} IRAF host interface...|$|E
40|$|Stata is a <b>command</b> <b>driven</b> <b>program.</b> It is {{a general}} purpose {{statistical}} software package which is used by people of different backgrounds and professional disciplines. Most STATA users, however, are non-physicians. Since it is used by people of all fields, most training programs offered are geared towards programmers and non-physicians. Although STATA has simple commands, these {{may be difficult for}} non-programmers to utilize. Generally, physicians are familiar with clicking rather than writing commands. To teach Emergency Medicine (EM) residents, we developed a teaching approach using "pull-down" menus. Emphasis was on teaching how to enter and import data. During the EM research rotation, residents were introduced to the STATA software, in addition to research methods. We also developed a manual explaining the basic operations of STATA. We observed that for EM residents, it was easy to learn and use "pull-down" menus. Providing introduction of Stata prior to data entry improved the accuracy of data recording and facilitated data analysis. It also provided EM residents experience in order to navigate STATA following the completion of the research rotation. Although basic functions of STATA can be learnt via this method, we feel {{that it is necessary to}} develop a training program which addresses the needs of physicians. ...|$|E
