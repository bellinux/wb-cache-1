25|$|Both {{carbon and}} alloy steels are {{suitable}} for case-hardening; typically mild steels are used, with low carbon content, usually less than 0.3% (see plain-carbon steel for more information). These mild steels are not normally hardenable due to the low quantity of carbon, so {{the surface of the}} steel is chemically altered to increase the hardenability. Case-hardened steel is formed by diffusing carbon (<b>carburization),</b> nitrogen (nitriding) and/or boron (boriding) into the outer layer of the steel at high temperature, and then heat treating the surface layer to the desired hardness.|$|E
25|$|Although Roman iron-working was {{enhanced}} {{by a process}} known as <b>carburization,</b> the Romans are not thought to have developed true steel production. From the earliest history of the Roman state to its downfall, Roman arms were therefore uniformly produced from either bronze or, later, iron. As a result, the 1300 years of Roman military technology saw little radical change in technological level. Within the bounds of classical military technology, however, Roman arms and armor was developed, discarded, and adopted from other peoples based on changing methods of engagement. It included at various times stabbing daggers and swords, stabbing or thrusting swords, long thrusting spears or pikes, lances, light throwing javelins and darts, slings, and bow and arrows.|$|E
2500|$|Concurrent {{with the}} {{transition}} from bronze to iron was the discovery of <b>carburization,</b> the process of adding carbon to wrought iron. While the iron bloom contained some carbon, the subsequent hot-working oxidized most of it. [...] Smiths in the Middle East discovered that wrought iron could {{be turned into a}} much harder product by heating the finished piece in a bed of charcoal, and then quenching it in water or oil. This procedure turned the outer layers of the piece into steel, an alloy of iron and iron carbides, with an inner core of less brittle iron.|$|E
2500|$|The term {{case-hardening}} {{is derived}} from the practicalities of the <b>carburization</b> process itself, which is essentially the same as the ancient process. The steel work piece is placed inside a case packed tight with a carbon-based case-hardening compound. This is collectively known as a carburizing pack. The pack is put inside a hot furnace for a variable length of time. Time and temperature determines how deep into the surface the hardening extends. However, the depth of hardening is ultimately limited by the inability of carbon to diffuse deeply into solid steel, and a typical depth of surface hardening with this method is up to 1.5mm. Other techniques are also used in modern carburizing, such as heating in a carbon-rich atmosphere. Small items may be case-hardened by repeated heating with a torch and quenching in a carbon rich medium, such as the commercial products Kasenit / Casenite or [...] "Cherry Red". Older formulations of these compounds contain potentially toxic cyanide compounds, while the more recent types such as Cherry Red do not.|$|E

50|$|Metalsmiths {{from this}} era had already {{developed}} a crude version of modern metallurgical processes, notably the hardening of soft iron through <b>carburization.</b>|$|E
50|$|Early <b>carburization</b> used {{a direct}} {{application}} of charcoal packed around the sample {{to be treated}} (initially referred to as case hardening), but modern techniques use carbon-bearing gases or plasmas (such as carbon dioxide or methane). The process depends primarily upon ambient gas composition and furnace temperature, which must be carefully controlled, as the heat may also impact the microstructure of {{the remainder of the}} material. For applications where great control over gas composition is desired, <b>carburization</b> may take place under very low pressures in a vacuum chamber.|$|E

5000|$|Various {{methods were}} used to produce {{crucible}} steel. According to Islamic texts such as al-Tarsusi and Abu Rayhan Biruni, three methods are described for indirect production of steel. The medieval Islamic historian Abu Rayhan Biruni (c. 973-1050) provides the earliest reference of the production of Damascus steel. He describes only three methods for producing steel.The first method and the most common traditional method is solid state <b>carburization</b> of wrought iron. This is a diffusion process in which wrought iron is packed in crucibles or a hearth with charcoal, then heated to promote diffusion of carbon into the iron to produce steel. <b>Carburization</b> {{is the basis for}} the wootz process of steel.The second method is the decarburization of cast iron by removing carbon from the cast iron.The third method uses wrought iron and cast iron. In this process, wrought iron and cast iron may be heated together in a crucible to produce steel by fusion. In regard to this method Abu Rayhan Biruni states: [...] "this was the method used in Hearth". It is proposed that the Indian method refers to Wootz <b>carburization</b> method; i.e., the Mysore or Tamil processes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carburization</b> is a diffusion-controlled process, so {{the longer}} the steel is held in the carbon-rich {{environment}} the greater the carbon penetration will be and the higher the carbon content. The carburized section will have a carbon content high enough {{that it can be}} hardened again through flame or induction hardening.|$|E
50|$|It is {{virtually}} impossible to have a workpiece undergo <b>carburization</b> without having some dimensional changes. The amount of these changes varies based on the type of material that is used, the carburizing process that the material undergoes and the original size and shape of the work piece. However changes are small compared to heat-treating operations.|$|E
50|$|The {{conventional}} TG {{focuses on}} {{various aspects of}} ANALYSIS of materials; the other facet of thermogravimetry is studying SYNTHESIS, e.g. using a thermobalance to monitor the making of materials. The industrial processes of chemical vapor deposition (CVD), chemical vapor infiltration (CVI), metallurgical <b>carburization,</b> synthesis of carbon-carbon composites can greatly benefit from modeling them with large-sample TG instruments.|$|E
50|$|Decarburization can {{be either}} {{advantageous}} or detrimental, depending on the application for which the metal will be used. It is thus both {{something that can be}} done intentionally as a step in a manufacturing process, or something that happens as a side effect of a process (such as rolling) and must be either prevented or later reversed (such as via a <b>carburization</b> step).|$|E
50|$|The {{cementation}} process is an obsolete technology for making steel by <b>carburization</b> of iron. Unlike modern steelmaking, it increased {{the amount of}} carbon in the iron. It was apparently developed before the 17th century. Derwentcote Steel Furnace, built in 1720, is the earliest surviving example of a cementation furnace. Another example in the UK is the cementation furnace in Doncaster Street, Sheffield.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of this class of steel is the ability to be case hardened by <b>carburization</b> of the surface. The core of the material retains its bulk properties, while the outer surface is significantly hardened to reduce wear and tear. This makes this grade of steel an excellent material for uses such as gears, piston pins, and crankshafts.|$|E
50|$|Most {{production}} crankshafts use {{induction hardened}} bearing surfaces, since that method gives good results with low costs. It also allows the crankshaft to be reground without re-hardening. But high performance crankshafts, billet crankshafts in particular, {{tend to use}} nitridization instead. Nitridization is slower and thereby more costly, and in addition it puts certain demands on the alloying metals in the steel {{to be able to}} create stable nitrides. The advantage of nitridization is that it can be done at low temperatures, it produces a very hard surface, and the process leaves some compressive residual stress in the surface, which is good for fatigue properties. The low temperature during treatment is advantageous in that it doesn’t have any negative effects on the steel, such as annealing. With crankshafts that operate on roller bearings, the use of <b>carburization</b> tends to be favored due to the high Hertzian contact stresses in such an application. Like nitriding, <b>carburization</b> also leaves some compressive residual stresses in the surface.|$|E
50|$|The Chiusian sword {{was created}} {{from a single}} bloom by forging from a {{temperature}} of 1237 °C. The carbon content increased from 0.05-0.08% at {{the back side of}} the sword to 0.35-0.4% on the blade, from which the authors deduce that some form of <b>carburization</b> may have been used. The sword was 40 cm long and was characterized by a wasp-waist close to the hilt.|$|E
50|$|Plasma <b>carburization</b> is {{increasingly}} {{used to improve}} the surface characteristics (such as wear, corrosion resistance, hardness, load-bearing capacity, in addition to quality-based variables) of various metals, notably stainless steels. The process is environmentally friendly (in comparison to gaseous or solid carburizing). It also provides an even treatment of components with complex geometry (the plasma can penetrate into holes and tight gaps), making it very flexible in terms of component treatment.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, while {{heating and}} folding serves to even out the {{distribution}} of carbon throughout the blade, {{a small amount of}} carbon is also 'burnt out' of the steel in this process; repeated folding will eventually remove most of the carbon, turning the material into softer iron and reducing its ability to hold a sharp edge. This can be combated with <b>carburization,</b> though it does not produce even carbon distribution, partially defeating the purpose of folding.|$|E

50|$|Mining in the Philippines began around 1000 BC. However, the {{discovery}} of a brass needle in Musang Cave, Cagayan pushed back the date to 2160 BC, the date the needle was made. Metal smiths from this era had already developed a crude version of modern metallurgical processes, notably the hardening of soft iron through <b>carburization.</b> However, unlike the typical pattern, there had been no shift to copper or bronze implements before iron implements, it had been from stone to iron.|$|E

50|$|Carbonitriding {{is similar}} to gas <b>carburization</b> with the {{addition}} of ammonia to the carburizing atmosphere, which provides a source of nitrogen. Nitrogen is absorbed at the surface and diffuses into the workpiece along with carbon. Carbonitriding (around 850 °C / 1550 °F) is carried out at temperatures substantially higher than plain nitriding (around 530 °C / 990 °F) but slightly lower than those used for carburizing (around 950 °C / 1700 °F) and for shorter times. Carbonitriding tends to be more economical than carburizing, and also reduces distortion during quenching. The lower temperature allows oil quenching, or even gas quenching with a protective atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|Incidental {{decarburization}} can {{be detrimental}} to surface properties in products (where carbon content is desirable) when done during heat treatment or after rolling or forging, because the material is only affected to a certain depth according to the temperature and duration of heating. This can be prevented by using an inert or reduced-pressure atmosphere, applying resistive heating for a short duration, by limiting the time that material is under high heat, as is done in a walking-beam furnace, or through restorative <b>carburization,</b> which uses a hydrocarbon atmosphere to transfer carbon into {{the surface of the}} material during annealing. The decarburized surface material can also be removed using a grinding machine.|$|E

50|$|Carburizing, {{carburising}} (chiefly British English), or <b>carburization</b> is a {{heat treatment}} {{process in which}} iron or steel absorbs carbon while the metal is heated {{in the presence of}} a carbon-bearing material, such as charcoal or carbon monoxide. The intent is to make the metal harder. Depending on the amount of time and temperature, the affected area can vary in carbon content. Longer carburizing times and higher temperatures typically increase the depth of carbon diffusion. When the iron or steel is cooled rapidly by quenching, the higher carbon content on the outer surface becomes hard due to the transformation from austenite to martensite, while the core remains soft and tough as a ferritic and/or pearlite microstructure.|$|E
50|$|Recent archaeological {{investigations}} {{have suggested that}} Sri Lanka also supported innovative technologies for {{iron and steel production}} in antiquity. The Sri Lankan system of crucible steel making was partially independent of the various Indian and Middle Eastern systems. Their method was something similar to the method of <b>carburization</b> of wrought iron. The earliest confirmed crucible steel site is located in the knuckles range in the northern area of the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka dated to 6th −10th centuries CE. In twelfth century the land of Serendib (Sri Lanka) seems to have been the main supplier of crucible steel, but over the centuries slipped back, and by the nineteenth century just a small industry survived in the Balangoda district of the central southern highlands.|$|E
50|$|The {{two most}} {{prominent}} crucible steel sites in eastern Uzbekistan carrying the Ferghana Process are Akhsiket and Pap in the Ferghana Valley, whose {{position within the}} Great Silk Road has been historically and archaeologically proved. The material evidence of the sites consists of large number of archaeological finds relating to steel making from 9th-12th centuries CE {{in the form of}} hundreds of thousands of fragments of crucibles often with massive slag cakes. Archaeological work at Akhsiket, has identified that the crucible steel process was of the <b>carburization</b> of iron metal. This process appears to be typical of and restricted to the Ferghana Valley in eastern Uzbekistan, and it is therefore called the Ferghana Process. This process lasts in that region for roughly four centuries..|$|E
