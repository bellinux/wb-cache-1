From single permeation experiments {{it was concluded that}} the triple coated NaA membrane gave better selectivities than the double coating one, but the selectivities were still in the range of Knudsen selectivities. Significant permeation of SF 6 was also observed, which indicated that intracrystalline diffusion could not be neglected. From the single gas permeation experiments, using the triple coated membrane, the important transport mechanisms were determined and it was shown that the resistance in the support can be as high as 60 %. depending on the applied pressure difference and temperature. The resistance in the support itself is predominant Knudsen diffusion, due to the relative small average pore radius of the support. The permeability of the NaA layer was higher than NaA membranes presented in the open literature, which were tested under similar conditions, which could also be attributed to the occurrence of intracrystalline diffusion. The selectivity of the membranes in binary mixtures of CO 2 /H 2, CO/H 2 and C 02 /CO were very close to unity, showing that the used triple coated NaA membrane was not suited for the separation of any of the studied gases. A reason for the bad performance of the membrane could be the relative short time used for the growth of the NaA crystals. Microscopic inspection showed that the crystal growth was not complete. and together with the hydrophilic character of the NaA zeolite this was probably the main reason for the occurrence of intracrystalline diffusion. A longer synthesis time was therefore also recommended. Master...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. Pervaporation {{has gained}} {{increasing}} attention as an energy saving process for separating azeotropes such as ethanol and water mixtures. Pervaporation distinguishes itself from other membrane processes in that it entails a phase transition step that occurs during the diffusion through the membrane, from the liquid phase in the feed to a vapor phase in the permeate. Pervaporation performance is mainly regulated by the physicochemical structure of the membrane rather than the vapor-liquid equilibrium of the system. A significant amount of literature is available to show the successful developments in terms of membranes and their use for pervaporation applications. In spite of the substantial progress in pervaporation using polymeric membranes, as has been reviewed in several articles, zeolite membranes have various advantages over polymeric membranes, most notably their chemical and thermal stability. Due to their uniform molecular-sized pores, zeolites are highly suitable for the separation of molecules in mixtures both through their adsorption capacity and molecular sieving effects. It was {{the aim of this}} study to evaluate the suitability of our in-house manufactured <b>centrifugally</b> <b>casted</b> ceramic support for coating with a thin defect free NaA zeolite layer. The composite membrane was used to optimise some of the variables pertaining to water ethanol pervaporation. Both single and double coated NaA ceramic composite membranes were manufactured. The integrity of the zeolite layer was confirmed by SEM. XRD was used to show that the coated layer consisted of the zeolite NaA. According to the XRD no impurities were present. Both the single and double coated membranes were used for pervaporation. During pervaporation, the influence of the feed temperature and composition on both the single components and binary mixtures was determined. The binary mixtures were evaluated by varying the feed composition from 5 to 95 % water and the feed temperature from 308 K to 328 K. The single coated membrane performed better than the double coated membrane both in terms of flux and selectivity. The single coated membrane yielded a maximum flux of 4. 50 kg. m- 2 h- 1 at a selectivity of nearly 20 000, compared to the highest flux for the double coated membrane of 0. 70 kg. m- 2. h- 1 and a selectivity of 4000. While the fluxes for the single components were higher than for the binary mixtures, the real selectivity for the binary mixture increased substantially from the ideal selectivity obtained with the single components. This was explained in terms of the preferential adsorption and condensation of water in the hydrophilic zeolite pores (both intra- and intercrystalline). Due to the condensation of water in the pores, the permeation of the ethanol is restricted, resulting in the significant separation factor obtained. For the binary mixture, it was found that both the total flux and the water flux increase with increasing temperature and water content in the feed. The best compromise in terms of flux and selectivity, i. e. an average flux and maximum selectivity was obtained between 55 and 75 % water in the feed at 328 K. The high selectivity obtained throughout this study confirmed that a defect free zeolite NaA had been grown onto the smooth inside surface of the tubular ceramic support. The zeolite layer was furthermore very thin, confirmed by the high fluxes obtained compared to literature. Master...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. In this study, the {{feasibility}} of a NaA zeolite membrane for the gas phase separation of steam and hydrogen mixtures was determined. The Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process, which produces high value fuels and chemicals from coal and natural gas, can be greatly improved upon by the selective removal {{of water from the}} FT reactor product stream. According to the FT reaction kinetics, the rate of reaction increases with the partial pressure of hydrogen but is adversely affected the presence of water in the reactor product stream. Chemisorbed water {{on the surface of the}} metal catalysts also enhances deactivation due to sintering and fouling. The use of a zeolite membrane reactor is well equipped to serve the purpose of in-situ water removal as it can facilitate the separation of chemical components from one another in the presence of catalytic reactions. The LTA type zeolite membrane NaA or zeolite 4 A, in particular, is well suited for the separation of polar (H 2 O) from non-polar (H 2) molecules because of its high hydrophilicity. NaA has also been identified as an excellent candidate for selective water removal applications due its high adsorption affinity and capacity for water. The NaA membrane used in this study was manufactured by means of the in-situ crystallisation method where the growth of crystals on the inside surface of a <b>centrifugally</b> <b>casted</b> a-alumina support was favoured. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses performed on the membrane after a double hydrothermal synthesis indicated that the surface topology was rough and that the zeolite crystals formed were not uniform in size. Overall, the membrane thickness varied between 6. 5 and 8. 0 flm. An evaluation of the membrane quality was made possible through permeation experiments involving SF 6 and Hz. The calculated Hz/SF 6 permselectivity in this study was found to be 9. 78, which despite being higher than the Knudsen diffusion selectivity of 8. 54, confirmed the presence of intercrystalline defects or non-zeolitic pores in the membrane. Experiments concerning pure component and binary mixture permeation of steam and hydrogen through the supported NaA membrane were conducted over a temperature range of 115 °C to 160 °c for binary hydrogen/steam mixtures, 25 °C to 160 °C for pure hydrogen and 130 °C to 170 °C for pure steam. For the permeation of pure component hydrogen, a local maximum in its permeance having a value of 224 x 10 '° 8 mol. m,z. s'!. Pa'! was reached at a system pressure and temperature of 6. 875 bar and 75 °C respectively. For the permeation of pure component steam through NaA, the effects of capillary condensation in the pores and defects of the zeolite membrane resulted in a decrease in steam permeance as a function of absolute pressure for temperatures lower than 160 °c. Once the effects of capillary condensation had receded, maxima in the steam permeances as a function of temperature corresponding to values of 70 x 10, 08, 65 X 10, 08 and 75 x 10, 08 mol. m• 2. s'I. Pa'l were found for the 182. 5, 197. 5 and 222. 5 kPa isobars respectively. These observations collaborated well with the description of surface diffusion with permeation taking place in the Langmuir (strong adsorption) regime. Permeation experiments through NaA as function of temperature were conducted for a 90 mol% steam - 10 mol% hydrogen (90 - 10) binary mixture as well as for a 60 - 40 mixture of these two. At low temperatures the permeation of hydrogen was completely suppressed by the condensed steam resulting in an almost perfect separation. The Kelvin equation was used to estimate the pore size of the defects which was found to range between 1. 86 and 2. 45 nm. The temperature range over which these defects in the membrane were assumed to become unblocked (i. e. assuming when the first breakthrough of hydrogen occurred), were determined to be between 140 to 148 °c and between 128 to 130 °c for the 90 - 10 and 60 - 40 mixtures respectively. The mixture selectivities (towards water) between 115 °c and 130 °c were found to be immensely high (much greater than 1000) for both the 90 - 10 and 60 - 40 mixtures, while the ideal selectivities were calculated to be less than lover the same temperature range. At 140 °c, the selectivity towards water for the 9010 mixture was still greater than 1000; however for the 60 - 40 mixture at this temperature, an inversion of selectivity towards H 2 had already taken place. The breakthrough in H 2 permeance occurs at a much lower temperature when the feed mixture contains a lower concentration of water. Since the partial pressure of steam will be reduced, larger pores will become unblocked at lower temperatures according to the Kelvin equation. Master...|$|R

40|$|A {{detailed}} microstructural {{analysis was}} conducted {{on a series of}} radial shell samples extracted from commercially produced <b>centrifugally</b> spin <b>casted</b> high-speed steel (HSS) work rolls for finishing hot strip mills (HSM). The systematic microstructural analysis was coupled with a numerical and experimental investigation to improve the life of HSS rolls. An integrated computational-experimental approach was developed to optimize the response of the HSS roll material that permitted the enhancement of the microstructure and properties of the HSS roll shell layer. Local continuous microstructural transformations through the thickness of the shell: carbide formation, precipitation, dissolution sequence and phase changes, were studied in great details. The analyses were conducted with the aid of advanced metallographic and experimental methods, finite-element (FE) analysis, and using commercial software systems to conduct thermodynamic-kinetics predictions. In order to analyze a response of the HSS roll to the hardening heat treatment (HT) and to control stress-strain evolution, a 3 -D FE model was developed of the composite structure of the roll. The multilayered model considers nonlinear material properties of each individual layer as a function of temperature, based on measured chemical composition gradients through the HSS shell. Transient coupled thermal-stress analysis was performed, using actual measured surface temperatures as boundary conditions (BC) for the FE model. The allowable thermal stress-strain levels were established and compared with a) thermodynamically predicted high temperature mechanical properties and b) room temperature test results of the shear strengths for the shell, bonding and core. In addition, sub-structuring and image-based processing techniques were implemented to aid {{in the development of a}} meso-scale FE model to simulate the local response of a given microstructural constituents and matrix under particular thermal conditions. The fundamental interpretation of multilayered structure and multi-scale approach help to understand the kinetics phenomena associated with continuous local microstructural transformations due to nonlinear heat transfer. The results from the microstructural observations were in good agreement with the numerical predictions. The major impact of this work clearly indicated that a refined as-cast structure prior to the heat treatment promoted an increased precipitation of carbides during final hardening, which greatly improved strength and performance. A non-conventional HT was defined and implemented in order to provide an additional degree of microstructural pre-conditioning, which homogenized the matrix throughout the HSS shell. The new HT defined the austenitization temperatures and times to modify the morphology of brittle interdendritic eutectic carbide networks and, hence, facilitating the kinetics of dissolution of these carbides. This behavior caused an increase in the solute content of the matrix. As a result, the matrix hardness and strength were increased during subsequent hardening HT in comparison to the conventional HT routes used for as-cast HSS rolls.

The {{results show that the}} main crack path is interdendritic at a macroscopic scale, but that the fracture surface is characterized by dimples at microscale in all samples, suggesting that the fracture micromechanism does not change, in spite of the large ductility loss observed in the aged samples (fracture elongation, ε¯f≈ 0. 16, for samples aged at 770 °C) compared with ‘as-cast’ samples (ε¯f≈ 0. 42) ...|$|E
40|$|Syntactic {{functionally}} graded {{metal matrix}} composites (SFGMMC) are {{a class of}} metallic foams in which closed porosity results from the presence of hollow ceramic microspheres (microballoons), whose spatial distribution varies continuously between the inner and the outer section of the part, thus resulting in a continuous variation in properties. In this work, aluminium-based SFGMMC rings were fabricated by radial centrifugal casting. The graded composition along the radial direction is controlled mainly by {{the difference in the}} centrifugal forces which act on the molten metal matrix and the ceramic particles, due to their dissimilar densities. In this case where the density of the SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 microballoons is lower than that of molten aluminium, the particles show a tendency to remain closer to the inner periphery of the ring. Thus the microballoon volume fraction increases along the radial direction of the ring from the outer to the inner periphery; in other words, the particle-rich zone is limited to an inner layer of the ring. Precursor conventional MMCs were prepared by stir-casting from the constituent materials, by homogeneously dispersing commercial SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 microballoons (particle size: 50 m; particle volume fraction: 5 and 10 %) within a molten commercial Al- 7 Si- 0. 3 Mg (A 356) alloy. The resulting MMCs were then re-melt and <b>centrifugally</b> <b>cast</b> in order to produce the functionally graded composites. Particle gradients in the <b>centrifugally</b> <b>cast</b> composites were investigated by quantitative image analysis of optical micrographs (for the estimation of the particle volume fraction, mean particle diameter and porosity volume fraction) Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Isothermal {{transformation}} {{behavior of}} a 10 % Cr heat resistant steel fabricated by centrifugal casting process was investigated. Normalized specimen at 1100 oC for 1 hour was isothermally annealed at temperature range between 600 oC and 700 oC with various time. The annealed specimen had eutectoid structure which was generated along austenitic grain boundary during isothermal annealing. Areal fraction of eutectoid structure increased up to 25 % after holding at 700 oC for 20 hours. It was observed that austenitic matrix was transformed to ferrite structure and fine M 23 C 6 carbides with increase of annealing time.

40|$|<b>Centrifugally</b> <b>cast</b> {{materials}}, namely HK- 40, HP Modified and Micro-Alloy {{materials are}} used in Steam Reformer tube applications. These materials, operating in the creep range, are subject to time/temperature related degradation which can manifest in several ways. The quantification of damage is of vital importance if tube life is to be predicted accurately. A comprehensive nondestructive inspection approach has been developed to assess the exact degree of damage. The approach utilizes several NDE techniques including ultrasonic, eddy current and dimensional measurements. The combination of the techniques provides valuable data for establishing condition assessment and remaining tube life prediction. Experiences and findings {{are discussed in the}} paper.

40|$|Cutting tools get {{worn out}} due to wear and are ground {{in order to}} use them again. This wear may be due to {{abrasive}} wear, diffusion wear, fatigue wear, adhesive wear. Wear of tool steels leads to shortening of the length, so small that the tool bits are no more usable. These waste and thrown away tool bits were collected which may include steel waste, pig iron, molybdenum iron, chromium iron, vanadium iron, tungsten iron and other waste material. This mixture was melted in induction furnace at temperature about 1600 o C to 1700 o C. After that the casting of the melt was done through the centrifugal route at speeds of 200 rpm and 250 rpm. The cast obtained is in the shape of tool steel cylinder. Then the samples were prepared for the hardness test, machinability test and SEM analysis. The hardness was measured across the radius of the cast cylinder by using Rockwell hardness test machine in C-scale. The machinability test specimens were taken from the outer zone of the cast cylinder and the test was carried out in Lathe by keeping the variables such as rotation speed (420 rpm), feed rate (0. 15 KM), rack angle (10 0) material to be machined (mild steel) and time of machining (5 minutes 40 seconds) constant. The machinability of the <b>centrifugally</b> <b>cast</b> samples were compared with the as-cast samples. SEM micrographs were taken for the outer region of the cast cylinder and a comparative study was made with the as-cast samples. We found that there is an increase in hardness values with the distance from the centre to the outer periphery of the cast samples also the hardness values are higher for speed 250 rpm than 200 rpm. The Machinability of the <b>centrifugally</b> <b>cast</b> samples was better than generally used tool steels...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} integration technique {{utilizing a}} point source Green's function is introduced {{to analyze the}} wave behavior in transversely isotropic-type anisotropic media allowing us to make fast and accurate computations of the acoustic field. The <b>centrifugally</b> <b>cast</b> stainless steel (CCSS) used in nuclear power plants is chosen as a sample medium because of its columnar grain character leading to material anisotropy. A representative number of field profiles are computed and plotted to illustrate the quasi-longitudinal, quasi-transverse, and horizontally-polarized shear wave propagation i a transversely-isotropic medium. Phenom-ena such as beam skewing, beam splitting, beam focusing, unsymmetrical beams, and other anisotropic effects, {{some of which are}} already known from earlier experimental observations, emerge as a computational result of the introduced technique.
