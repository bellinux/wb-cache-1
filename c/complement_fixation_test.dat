5|$|While in Egypt, Fairley {{investigated}} schistosomiasis (then {{known as}} bilharzia). The disease {{was known to}} be caused by contact with fresh water inhabited by certain species of snails, and orders had been issued that prohibited bathing in fresh water, but the troops were slow to appreciate the danger involved. In its toxic phase, the disease was easily confused with typhus, so Fairley developed a <b>complement</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>test</b> for the disease {{along the lines of the}} Wassermann test. He studied its pathology, confirming that the worms in the circulatory system could be cured by intravenous tartaric acid. Fairley also studied, and later published papers on typhus, malaria, and bacillary dysentery.|$|E

Seventy-seven per cent of <b>complement</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>tests</b> done on the sera of 565 normal adults who admitted a previous attack of mumps were positive.

40|$|It {{was shown}} in a {{previous}} communication (1) that following the intraparotid inoculation of monkeys (M. mulatta) with the virus of mumps, an antigen is produced in the gland which reacts with an antibody in the serum of monkeys convalescent from the infection {{to bring about the}} <b>fixation</b> of <b>complement.</b> The antibody was not found in normal animals.

Tests targeting the presence of serum antibodies to P. brasiliensis simultaneously detect both active and historical infections and cannot descriminate active infection.

METHODS [...] Paired sera from 60 patients with respiratory infection who had tested positive for M pneumoniae by <b>complement</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>test</b> were analysed with Serofast and indirect EIA for specific IgG and IgM antibodies. RESULTS [...] Serofast was less sensitive than the two other tests. Only 30 (50 %) out of 60 paired sera which showed a diagnostic seroconversion or had high positive, unchanged antibody titres by <b>complement</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>test</b> or EIA, or both, tested positive with Serofast. Positive test results with Serofast {{were associated with the}} presence of a <b>complement</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>test</b> titre of > or = 512 and high positive IgM antibody titres measurable by EIA; virtually all patients with a <b>complement</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>test</b> titre of < 256 or those responding primarily in the IgG class tested negative with Serofast. Based on analysis of sera taken at the acute phase of infection, 10 (17 %) of the 60 patients tested positive by <b>complement</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>test,</b> 10 (17 %) by EIA, and only four (7 %) by Serofast. CONCLUSIONS [...] Serofast was less sensitive than <b>complement</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>test</b> and EIA and it cannot be recommended as a replacement for either test in routine diagnostic use. It might prove useful in laboratories where non-specific tests, such as the determination of cold agglutinins, are still used for the diagnosis of M pneumoniae infection.
