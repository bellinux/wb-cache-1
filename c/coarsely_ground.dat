Eight Italian Friesian primiparous cows were divided into two homogeneous groups and fed a control diet (based on corn silage, fescue hay and a concentrate) or the same diet having 0. 9 Kg DM concentrate replaced by <b>coarsely</b> <b>grounded</b> flaxseed for a 21 d experimental period. The groups were inverted in respect to the dietary treatments in a subsequent experimental period according to a change-over design. The flaxseed inclusion (4 - 5 % DM) had a positive effect on dry matter intake (DMI, 22. 2 vs. 21. 3 Kg/d) and significantly (P< 0. 01) increased the MY (26. 9 vs. 26. 1 Kg/d) and milk fat corrected yield (FCM, 27. 7 vs. 26. 7 Kg/d). Milk fat and protein percentages (4. 18 and 3. 46 %, respectively on average) were not affected by flaxseed treatment. Results also indicated a significant (P< 0. 01) reduction of saturated fatty acid/unsaturated fatty acid ratio (SFA/UFA) and an increase of n- 3 /n- 6 FA, monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA).

40|$|AbstractAccelerated Solvent Extraction (ASE) and Dynamic Maceration (DM) {{were used}} with {{n-hexane}} {{to study the}} extraction of oil from date seed powders with different particle sizes. The intensification was studied with instant controlled pressure drop (DIC) as texturing pretreatment. DM yields increased from 4. 57 % to 10. 49 ± 0. 05 % dry–dry basis (ddb) when particle size decreased from 1. 4 to 0. 2 mm. For <b>coarsely</b> <b>grounded</b> seed powder, ASE oil yields were 11. 35 ± 0. 05 % ddb and 14. 15 % ddb for untreated and DIC date-seeds, respectively. Optimized DIC pretreatment allowed the smallest particle size powder to get 15. 2 ± 0. 05 % ddb as ASE yields, while the 2 -h DM yields increased from 4. 67 to 11. 62 ± 0. 05 % ddb for particle size decreased from 1. 4 to 0. 2 mm, respectively. Fundamental analysis of various powders was achieved through washing–diffusion phenomenological model. DIC texturing implied higher washing stage, with relative starting accessibility %δYs of 70 % against 55 % for untreated particles. Consequently, the diffusion stage time was dramatically reduced, without great modification of effective diffusivity Deff value. Therefore, DIC ground seeds greatly enhanced the mass transfer mechanism. The evaluation of starting accessibility δYs enables to establish an empirical relationship between δYs and particle diameter δYs=f(D). Finally, DIC texturing did not imply any modification of the lipid profile...|$|R

40|$|A vast {{majority}} of the studies addressing the free radicals including hydroxyl radical is a damage compound of biochemical molecules such as DNA, proteins and lipids. When free radicals specially hydroxyl radical are not adequately removed from the body, it may damage biological macromolecules, leading to a variety of disease occurs. Therefore, the body should be protected by an enzymatic or non-enzymatic antioxidant defense system against free radicals. In order to explore the hypothesis that antioxidant plants can serve as therapeutic agents for diseases, the effect of Barberry fruit extracts was studied in an in vitro model. By evaluating their scavenging potential. Barberry fruits were collected from Babol, Iran and certified by the local scientist Mazandaran Province, Iran. The Barberry fruits were cleaned and dried at room temperature while keeping away from direct sunlight and then powdered. Suitable amounts of dried plant were <b>coarsely</b> <b>grounded</b> and used for extraction. The dry plant samples were extracted with water and/or ethanol. 10 g of Barberry fruits extracts powder was percolated by water for 24 hours. The extract was filtered and concentrated. Hydroxyl radical was produced as described previously. Then, Barberry fruits hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity was determined using deoxyribose degradation system, followed spectrophotometrically at 532 nm. As expected,our data indicate that the level of hydroxyl radical generation in with aqueous and /or ethanol extracts of barberry fruit was decreased in comparison without barberry fruit extract in vitro system [(6. 11 ± 0. 83, 5. 28 ± 1. 44, mmol/ml) vs. (9. 32 ± 0. 38...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of our study}} were to examine certain chemical quality parameters in samples of various subgroups of boiled sausages and compare obtained values with reference values (Rule book {{on the quality of}} minced meat, semi-finished meat and meat products, Official Gazette of RS, no. 31 / 2012). We used two reference chemical methods: determination of nitrogen and phosphorus content (SRPS ISO 937 : 1992, SRPS ISO 13730 : 1999). For determination of hydroxyproline we used M 050 “in house” modified method. We concluded that the total number of tested samples of Fine grounded boiled sausages (n= 170), 47 (27. 65 %) does not match the requirements for the quality provided the above mentioned Rule book, of which 21 samples because lower total protein content (TP) and 33 samples because higher relative protein content of connective tissue (RPC). The most common chemical quality failure of examined <b>Coarsely</b> <b>grounded</b> boiled sausages (n= 94) is a higher percent of RPC than allowed (18 - 25 %). We consider in samples of same subgroup lower content of TP in 8 samples (11. 11 %). From a total of 8 samples tested Boiled sausages with meat peaces (Šunkarica), all tested samples revealed lower content of TP than allowed (100 %) and 2 samples (25 %) higher relative protein content of connective tissue (RPC). The most common deficiency that reduces the chemical quality of the boiled sausages is higher level of RPC, demonstrated in 53 (19. 48 %) of the total (n= 272) samples tested. Something minor drawback is the lower percent of TP determined in 37 samples (13. 60 %).

Starch soluble fraction (A) of the dent hybrid ensiled corn grains was greater comparing to the dry materials and in both conservation forms this fraction was reduced in the flint texture hybrid, while the insoluble fraction potentially degradable (B) the opposite occurred. The degradation potential was higher in grains ensiled in two textures. The ensiled allowed more starch effective degradation in relation to dry grain in two textures and the grains dent texture hybrid also increased such degradation in both conservation methods. The dent texture and the ensiled high-moisture grains proved the best option considering the starch degradability. Regardless of the conservation forms, the grains of corn hybrid flint texture should be finely ground, for providing higher ruminal degradation, while for the dent texture hybrid, the coarsely and whole grinding are the most suitable for ensiled and dry grain, respectively...|$|R
