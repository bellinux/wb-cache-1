5000|$|In {{addition}} to the fundamental accelerating TM01 mode of an RF cavity, numerous higher frequency modes and a few lower-frequency dipole modes are excited by charged particle beam wakefields, all generally denoted higher order modes (HOMs). These modes serve no useful purpose for accelerator particle beam dynamics, only giving rise to beam instabilities, and are best heavily damped to have as low a QL as possible. The damping is accomplished by preferentially allowing dipole and all HOMs to leak out of the SRF cavity, and then coupling them to resistive RF loads. The leaking out of undesired RF modes occurs along the beampipe, and results from a careful design of the <b>cavity</b> <b>aperture</b> shapes. The aperture shapes are tailored to keep the TM01 mode [...] "trapped" [...] with high Qo inside of the cavity and allow HOMs to propagate away. The propagation of HOMs is sometimes facilitated by having a larger diameter beampipe {{on one side of}} the cavity, beyond the smaller diameter cavity iris, as seen in the SRF cavity CAD cross-section at the top of this wiki page. The larger beampipe diameter allows the HOMs to easily propagate away from the cavity to an HOM antenna or beamline absorber.|$|E

40|$|In some cases, {{convection}} heat transfer {{is a major}} source of thermal loss from a cavity receiver used in a solar dish application. As indicated in the previous study (Paitoonsurikarn et al, 2004), the presence of the wind can greatly affect the magnitude of the convection loss. However, the real effect at a <b>cavity</b> <b>aperture</b> also depends on the interaction between the wind and the dish structure. The present simulation investigates the relation between the magnitude of the freestream wind and that of the wind immediate to the <b>cavity</b> <b>aperture</b> at various wind directions. The configuration of the dish used in the study is that of the 20 m 2 dish currently used in the solar ammonia thermochemical demonstration plant at the ANU. The incidence angle is varied azimuthally, and ranges from- 90 degree to 90 degree, corresponding to the wind normally incident {{on the back of the}} receiver and the back of the dish, respectively. It is found that the near-aperture velocity is the greatest when the incidence angle is equal to 0 degree, i. e. where the wind is parallel to the aperture plane. Interestingly, the near-aperture velocity magnitude versus the wind direction obviously shows a symmetrical behaviour. Simple correlations to estimate the magnitudes of the normal and parallel velocity components at the aperture from the free-stream wind speed and direction are proposed. The present results could be employed in conjunction with a combined convection correlation for convection loss prediction in the future work. 1...|$|E

The investigation is undertaken in two categories: same inner heat transfer area and aperture area (case I) and same aspect ratio and aperture area (case II). These studies are carried out for five isothermal wall temperatures (523 to 923 K in steps of 100 K). The effect of inclination is studied for seven inclinations from 0 ° (<b>cavity</b> <b>aperture</b> facing sideways) to 90 ° (<b>cavity</b> <b>aperture</b> facing down), in steps of 15 °. The cavity shapes used are: cylindrical, conical (frustum of a cone), cone-cylindrical (combination of frustum of cone and cylindrical shape), dome-cylindrical (combination of hemispherical and cylindrical shape), hetro-conical, reverse-conical (frustum of a cone in the reverse orientation) and spherical. For both cases, conical cavity yields the lowest convective loss among the cavities investigated whereas spherical cavity results in the highest convective loss. Convective heat loss from cavities of different shapes and sizes are characterized by using different internal zone areas of the cavity (A cw, A cz, A cb and A w). A cb {{is found to be}} better parameter for characterization of the convective heat loss. Nusselt number correlation is developed using convective zone area (A cb). It correlates 91 % of data within ± 11 % deviation, 99 % of data within ± 16 % deviation. Radiative losses (Q rad) have been determined numerically from cavities of both cases. The ratio of Q rad /A ap is found to be more or less constant (variation within 5 %) for all types of cavities and for 0 ? epsilon ? 1.

Besides, effects of mouth blockage (mouth blockage area 36 % and 64 %) on forced convective heat loss are also investigated. Three wind directions viz., head-on, side-on and back-on and wind speed of 1 to 5 m/s are considered. The ratio of convective losses occurring under wind and no-wind conditions shows minimum value θ = 0 ° and it increases with cavity inclination. As expected, the convective heat loss under wind conditions {{is higher than the}} no-wind case. The convective heat losses are higher for head-on wind condition for all shapes in the range (1 to 5 m/s) of wind speed considered. Among the different shapes under study, conical cavity yields the lowest convective losses for both categories of cavities (with and without mouth blockage). Under wind condition, convective losses reduce marginally with mouth blockage. Increase of mouth blockage from 36 % (Dap = 0. 4 m) to 64 % (Dap = 0. 3 m) does not significantly alter the magnitude of convective loss.
