Among the administration's development initiatives are a US$100 million urban renewal project, {{the creation of}} garbage disposal and incineration plants, the launch of a citywide cleanup project, the creation of asphalt and <b>cement</b> <b>plants,</b> rehabilitation of the Town Hall and parliament buildings, reconstruction of the former Defence Ministry offices, reconstruction of correctional facilities, rehabilitation and construction of health facilities, establishment of a Police Training Center and a permanent base in Jasiira for the new Somali Armed Forces, rebuilding of the Somali Postal Service headquarters, and rehabilitation of public playgrounds in several districts. In January 2014, the Benadir administration launched the House Numbering and Post Code System. It also began distributing national identity cards in March of the same year. In addition, the municipal authorities started renovating important local government centers in September 2014, including the capital's former Fisho Guverno compound. In January 2015, the Benadir administration also opened a new Health & Safety Office to supervise health and safety practices in the city, and launched a municipal beautification campaign ahead of various international conferences that are slated to be held there.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the {{relationship}} between the competing editor, Jacobin, and Bratlie's failed replacement, Benjamin, did not go well either. Jacobin reportedly vaunted over the fire victims. In addition, Benjamin authored a series of critical editorials attacking both <b>cement</b> <b>plants</b> of Concrete for dust pollution which led to a loss of advertising revenue for his paper. As a result, in September 1916, Benjamin sold his rebranded Skagit Valley News to Mrs. N.I. Wolbert, and purchased interest in another Washington local paper Wilkeson Record instead.

The cement sector consisting of 27 plants is contributing above Rs 30 billion to the national exchequer in the form of taxes. However, by 2013, Pakistan's cement is fast-growing mainly because of demand from Afghanistan and countries boosting real estate sector, In 2013 Pakistan exported 7,708,557 metric tons of cement. Pakistan has installed capacity of 44,768,250 metric tons of cement and 42,636,428 metric tons of clinker.

25|$|To {{achieve the}} desired setting qualities in the {{finished}} product, a quantity (2–8%, but typically 5%) of calcium sulfate (usually gypsum or anhydrite) {{is added to the}} clinker, and the mixture is finely ground to form the finished cement powder. This is achieved in a cement mill. The grinding process is controlled to obtain a powder with a broad particle size range, in which typically 15% by mass consists of particles below 5 μm diameter, and 5% of particles above 45 μm. The measure of fineness usually used is the 'specific surface area', which is the total particle surface area of a unit mass of cement. The rate of initial reaction (up to 24 hours) of the cement on addition of water is directly proportional to the specific surface area. Typical values are 320–380m2·kg−1 for general purpose cements, and 450–650m2·kg−1 for 'rapid hardening' cements. The cement is conveyed by belt or powder pump to a silo for storage. <b>Cement</b> <b>plants</b> normally have sufficient silo space for one to 20 weeks of production, depending upon local demand cycles. The cement is delivered to end users either in bags, or as bulk powder blown from a pressure vehicle into the customer's silo. In industrial countries, 80% or more of cement is delivered in bulk.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening of}} Houston Ship Channel in 1914 {{led to the}} Port of Houston {{overtaking}} the Port of Galveston as the state's dominant seaport. The situation led Houston to also overtake Galveston as the primary shipping center for cotton. The large quantities {{of oil and gas}} moving through Houston, Baytown, Texas City, and surrounding communities made the area around the ship channel attractive for industrial development. Chemical plants, steel factories, <b>cement</b> <b>plants,</b> automobile manufacturing, and many other types of heavy industry that could benefit from a ready supply of cheap fuel rapidly developed in the area. By the 1930s, Houston had emerged as the state's dominant economic center, though it continued to compete with Dallas throughout the 1900s. The effects of the boom helped offset the effects of the Depression so much that Houston was called the [...] "city the Depression forgot." [...] Dallas and other Texas communities were also able to weather the Depression better than many American cities because of oil.|$|E
