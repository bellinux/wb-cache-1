In particular, he discovered the relations between <b>chlorotoluene</b> and benzyl chloride. In Göttingen, Beilstein began to collect systematic notes on organic compounds which finally led to the production of his famous handbook published in Hamburg. The first edition, which Beilstein compiled single-handedly, appeared in 1881 in two volumes, and was rapidly exhausted. The second edition began to appear in 1886 and filled three volumes of larger size than the first. The third edition was commenced in 1893, and its four volumes became unwieldy. It was finished in 1900, and has been supplemented by four large volumes of additions edited by the German Chemical Society, which became the proprietor of the handbook.|$|E

Conditions investigated are similar to those encountered in post combustion and cooling-down zones of forest, agricultural and wild fires, as well as in burning of biomass contaminated or treated with pesticides. The experiments were conducted under fuel lean conditions in a tubular reactor housed in a three-zone heating furnace and operated with a dilute stream of alpha-cypermethrin in ultra high purity nitrogen and oxygen. PCDD/F were identified and quantified by high resolution gas chromatography (HRGC) -ion trap mass spectrometry (ITMS).

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis is concerned with {{an investigation into the}} role and behaviour of odd-electron transition metal complexes in promoting organic reactions. The metathesis reaction between cyclo­hexane and tetrachloromethane {{in the presence of a}} series of transition metal carbonyl-containing complexes has been studied and shown to afford chlorocyclohexane and trichloromethane in good yield. A detailed kinetic study of such a reaction was undertaken using [Re[sub] 2 (CO) [sub] 10] as the metal complex. This study indicated that the reaction followed a free-radical chain mechanism in which the metal complex acted solely as an initiator. A survey has been made of the relative efficiencies of other metal carbonyl complexes in initiating this reaction and these findings have been compared with the known behaviour and thermal stabilities of the complexes. The scope of the reaction has also been investigated using a number of different halogenating agents and various saturated and alkyl aromatic substrates. An investigation has also been made into the role of transition metal complexes in promoting the reaction between toluene and sulphuryl chloride. A study of the reaction in the presence of a series of transition metal carbonyl-containing complexes shows that the predominant reaction leads to formation of <b>chlorotoluenes</b> via an even-electron (ionic) mechanism. Conversely, when the same reaction is performed in the presence of the platinum and palladium complexes [M(PPh[sub] 3) [sub] 4] and [MCl[sub] 2 (PPh[sub] 3) [sub] 2] (M = Pt or Pd), the predominant product is benzyl chloride formed via an odd-electron (radical) mechanism. Under the reaction conditions the zerovalent complexes are rapidly oxidised to [MCl[sub] 2 (PPh[sub] 3) [sub] 2] and it is proposed that these species are primarily responsible for radical chain initiation. The [RuCl[sub] 2 (PPh[sub] 3) [sub] 3]-mediated reaction between toluene and sulphuryl chloride proves to be equally selective but promotes formation of <b>chlorotoluenes.</b> A study of the effect of sulphuryl chloride on the metal complexes utilised in the above reactions has shown that sulphuryl chloride is a very effective mild chlorinating agent for dinuclear or coordinatively unsaturated metal complexes. Thus the reaction between [M[sub] 2 (CO) [sub] 10] (M = Mn or Re) and sulphuryl chloride affords almost quantitative yields of [M(CO) [sub] 5 Cl] (M= Mn or Re) in a considerably more convenient procedure than previously reported. Moreover, reaction with [Re[sub] 2 (CO) [sub] 8 (PPh[sub] 3) [sub] 2] produces both the cis- and trans-isomers of [ReCl(CO) [sub] 4 PPh[sub] 3], the latter being hitherto unknown. Treatment of [Pt(PPh[sub] 3) [sub] 4] with sulphuryl chloride similarly affords cis- and trans-[PtCI[sub] 2 (PPh[sub] 3) [sub] 2]. The halogenation of toluene with di-chlorine in the presence of a number of transition metal complexes has also been studied. At elevated temperatures in the presence of [M(PPh[sub] 3) [sub] 4] and [MCl[sub] 2 (PPh[sub] 3) [sub] 2]] (M = Pt or Pd) the reaction is essentially identical to the analogous reaction with sulphuryl chloride. At 0 [sup]o C however, this free radical reaction is supressed and only <b>chlorotoluenes</b> were formed via an ionic mechanism involving higher oxidation state complexes of platinum and palladium...|$|R

Di- and trichlorotoluenes were either subject to TecA-mediated dioxygenation (the major or sole reaction observed for the 1, 2, 4 -substituted 2, 4 -, 2, 5 -, and 3, 4 -dichlorotoluenes), resulting {{in the formation of the}} dihydrodihydroxy derivatives, or to monooxygenation of the methyl substituent (the major or sole reaction observed for 2, 3 -, 2, 6 -, and 3, 5 -dichloro- and 2, 4, 5 -trichlorotoluenes), resulting in formation of the respective benzyl alcohols. All of the chlorotoluenes subject to dioxygenation by TecA were transformed, without intermediate accumulation of dihydrodihydroxy derivatives, into the respective catechols by TecAB, indicating that dehydrogenation is no bottleneck for chlorobenzene or <b>chlorotoluene</b> degradation.

40|$|A {{multiphase}} system {{consisting of}} a hydrocarbon solvent, a strong alkaline solution, and a quaternary onium salt, {{in the presence of}} a Pd/C catalyst with hydrogen at atmospheric pressure, allows the rapid and progressive displacement of the chlorine atoms from polyhalogenated benzenes.

The enhancement of the reaction rate compared with the known methods might be attributed to the facile adsorption of Hz by the catalyst under the reaction conditions.

Benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase and benzaldehyde dehydrogenase, two upper pathway enzymes, exhibit very broad substrate specificities and transform unsubstituted substrates and m- and p-methyl-, m- and p-ethyl-, and m- and p-chloro-substituted benzyl alcohols and benzaldehydes, respectively, at a high rate. In contrast, toluene oxidase only oxidizes toluene, m- and p-xylene, m-ethyltoluene, and 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene [corrected], also at a high rate. A biological test showed that toluene oxidase attacks m- and p-chlorotoluene, albeit at a low rate. No evidence for the transformation of p-ethyltoluene by toluene oxidase has been found. Hence, toluene oxidase acts as the bottleneck step for the catabolism of p-ethyl- and m- and p-chlorotoluene through the TOL upper pathway. A mutant toluene oxidase able to transform p-ethyltoluene was isolated, and a mutant strain capable of fully degrading p-ethyltoluene was constructed with a modified TOL plasmid meta-cleavage pathway able to mineralize p-ethylbenzoate.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) In this thesis, we have {{investigated}} the thermal decomposition of the pyrethroid, alpha-cypermethrin, and two cognate molecules of biphenyl and dibenzo-p-dioxin (DD), into toxic products including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/F, dioxins). Alpha-cypermethrin has widespread indoor and outdoor applications while biphenyl is mostly used as a fungicide and termiticide. Based on these results, a mechanism has been developed in which the key reaction steps occurring during pyrolysis and oxidation of alpha-cypermethrin are outlined. With the aim of gaining better and more comprehensive understanding {{of the formation of}} PCDD/F and destruction of DD, we examined a range of reaction conditions using a bench type tubular reactor facility, with particular focus on varying oxygen levels, temperatures and residence times. Stable reaction products were identified and quantitated using a range of analytical techniques and equipment, including micro gas chromatograph (µGC), triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (QQQMS), ion trap mass spectrometer (ITMS), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. For some key reaction steps, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were deployed to help unravel the reaction mechanism. Initially, we studied the pyrolysis of alpha-cypermethrin in the temperature range of 300 to 600 °C. We identified five main gaseous species including hydrogen chloride, hydrogen cyanide, methyl cyanide, acetaldehyde and crotonaldehyde. We identified two major pathways, one at low temperatures (two species form only at 450 °C) and the other at higher temperatures (formation of naphthalene and ethylbenzene, possibly by reaction with radicals, expulsion of CO and internal rearrangement, rather than by breaking of ether bridges). The unimolecular rearrangement of alpha-cypermethrin was observed at low temperatures, dominating over the alternative pathway which involves the recombination of the initial products. To gain further understanding of this pathway, we performed DFT computations, at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d) level of theory, to understand the role of the CN group in O-CH(CN) bond fission in alpha-cypermethrin, in comparison to fission of the same bond in permethrin. There is a significant lowering of the bond energy which is due to considerable stabilisation of the CH(CN) C₆H₅ radical compared with the benzyl radical formed in the permethrin model case. Consequently, the activation energy for O—CHCN fission in cypermethrin is relatively similar to the activation energy for internal rearrangement and aromatisation. Hence, bond fission in alpha-cypermethrin should predominate at a much lower temperature than in permethrin itself, exactly as observed in the present experiments. The oxidative pyrolysis of alpha-cypermethrin generates substantially more PCDF than PCDD under all experimental conditions (temperatures, residence times and equivalence ratio), with the maximum emission factor of PCDD/F being observed at 550 °C, a residence time of 5 s and an equivalence ratio of 0. 03. As indicated by the homologue distribution of PCDD/F, all the chlorinated congeners were detected with the exception of octachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and octachlorinated furans (OCDD/F) in our measurements. The VOC analysis revealed the production of benzene, phenol, <b>chlorotoluenes,</b> trichlorophenols, tetrachlorophenols. The formation of PCDD/F from the gas-phase oxidation of alpha-cypermethrin may proceed through the coupling of chlorophenoxy radicals to benzene or chlorinated benzenes, and the self-condensation of chlorophenoxy radicals. This study combines the results of experimental measurements and theoretical computations to investigate the initial steps in the oxidation of dibenzo-p-dioxin (DD). The analyses of VOC, performed on a high resolution gas chromatograph-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (HRGC-QQQMS), identified 2 -methylbenzofuran and 2, 3 -dihydro- 2 -methylenebenzofuran as the initial products. This has been confirmed by injection of authentic standards and the application of collision induced dissociation that fragmented the isolated parent ions into specific product ions affording the identification of parent species. The oxidative decomposition of DD initiated at around 450 °C, with the evolution of VOC being maximum between 650 and 700 °C. At temperatures in excess of 750 °C, all VOCs were completely oxidised. The potential energy surface, based on the density functional theory of B 3 LYP, mapped the initial steps involved in the oxidation of DD, and yielded a detailed reaction scheme for the onset of oxidation of DD that results in the formation of 2 -methylbenzofuran and 2, 3 -dihydro- 2 -methylenebenzofuran. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of the oxidation of biphenyl at low temperatures. Although it has been known for several years that combustion of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) in accidental fires of electrical equipment and in municipal waste can lead to significant emissions of dioxins, understanding of the mechanism of the oxidation process is quite limited. Oxidation of biphenyl (as a prototype model compound for PCB) in an alumina reactor at 490 ºC yields the initial products dibenzofuran and benzaldehyde which have been confirmed in GC/MS studies. It is postulated that O₂ (¹Δg) whose formation is catalysed by the reactor surfaces, initiates the reaction at this relatively low temperature. Quantum chemical computations of the reaction potential energy surfaces suggest low energy pathways to the observed initial products...|$|R
