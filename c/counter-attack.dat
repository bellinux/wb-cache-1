5|$|On 7 April, {{elements}} of XLVI Motorised Corps crossed the Drava at Gyékényes and attacked towards Koprivnica. Available {{troops of the}} 27th Infantry Division Savska took up defensive positions to stop this German penetration and Petrović ordered Nedeljković to mount a <b>counter-attack</b> against the bridgehead. By nightfall the <b>counter-attack</b> had not materialised, the defenders had withdrawn to Koprivnica, and Petrović had ordered Nedeljković to <b>counter-attack</b> on the following morning. Also on 7 April, the few remaining reconnaissance aircraft of the 4th Army mounted attacks on a bridge over the Drava at Gyékényes. On 8 April, the XLVI Motorised Corps continued with its limited objective attacks to expand its bridgehead at Gyékényes.|$|E
5|$|One {{reason for}} the success of the {{offensive}} in this sector was the failure of Falkenhausen to employ a defence in depth. In theory, the enemy would be allowed to make initial gains, thus stretching their lines of communication. Reserves held close to the battlefield would be committed once the initial advance had bogged down, before enemy reinforcements could be brought up. The defenders would thus be able to <b>counter-attack</b> and regain any lost territory. In this sector, Falkenhausen kept his reserve troops too far from the front and they were too late for a useful <b>counter-attack</b> on either 10 or 11 April.|$|E
5|$|The Russians {{assaulted}} {{the second}} Polish line and pierced it in numerous places. The position of Russian infantry {{was very difficult}} because it overtook the 14 Polish guns sent forward by General Bem to support the Polish <b>counter-attack,</b> which meant that it was under artillery fire from the front, the sides and the rear. Eventually a <b>counter-attack</b> by the 4th Line Infantry Regiment under Lt. Col. Kazimierz Majewski repelled the Russians storming the Polish lines. Several smaller Russian units broke through and tried to fortify a group of wooden houses in the suburb of Wola, but were quickly surrounded and killed. At that point, around 13:00, Małachowski wanted to organise yet another <b>counter-attack</b> aimed at Fort 56, but his orders were overridden by Krukowiecki, who feared that the Russians might want to attack further south, near Jerozolimskie Gate, and preferred to keep his reserves intact. The Polish side ceased all offensive actions on the western front, and only the artillery remained active.|$|E

5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the Egyptian artillery strikes alerted the Israelis, who attacked the strong point at the pumping station with armor and seized it. Instead of concentrating forces for a <b>counter-attack,</b> the battalion commander used only the forces originally assigned to the strong point in a <b>counter-attack</b> to regain it, which inevitably failed due to the paucity of forces. Meanwhile, the 81st Battalion reached Serabaeum where they established defenses, mainly at a position south of the railway station, at a hill called Orcha by the Israelis. At this point, only these two paratrooper battalions were positioned between Sharon's division and the Ismailia Canal.|$|E
5|$|US Marines {{conducted}} an amphibious landing at Cape Torokina, {{on the western}} coast of Bougainville, north of Empress Augusta Bay, in November 1943. After an initial <b>counter-attack</b> that was repulsed, the Marines {{had been replaced by}} a garrison of US Army troops who began consolidating their position around Torokina, establishing a strong perimeter. In March 1944, the Japanese launched a heavy <b>counter-attack,</b> which was turned back with many casualties. After this, the situation on Bougainville became largely static, as the Japanese focused primarily on subsistence, and the US forces chose to adopt a mostly defensive posture aimed at maintaining the perimeter around Torokina.|$|E
5|$|After {{capturing}} the crater, Cherry pushed {{on through the}} village, where his party emerged from among the buildings on the far side. Another stiff fight ensured {{with a group of}} Germans in dug-outs {{by the side of the}} road, before the company was able to meet up with its fellow units which had bypassed the village and were already established to the north and east of the area. Cherry's orders were to fall back into reserve, but he disregarded them as he sensed a <b>counter-attack</b> was forthcoming. At 09:00 on 27 March, the Germans launched a very strong <b>counter-attack</b> under heavy artillery fire. At one point, Cherry noticed that the Germans were firing yellow flares to pinpoint Australian positions to their gunners. He found some of these flares, and fired them away from his position. The German attempts to retake Lagnicourt—at a cost to the 7th Brigade of 377 casualties—raged all day before they abandoned the counterattack.|$|E

5|$|However, between March 14 and 15, the ARVN 2nd Infantry Regiment {{was forced}} to turn back from Tam Kỳ {{to deal with an}} attack on Thang Binh, by the Viet Cong 70th and 72nd Local Force Battalions. In {{southern}} Quảng Ngãi, the Viet Cong 94th Local Force Regiment attacked Binh Son, cut off a section of National Highway 1 near Chau O, and the ARVN 4th Infantry Regiment (2nd Infantry Division) was pinned down trying to deal with Viet Cong attacks. Thus, South Vietnamese attempts to stage an effective <b>counter-attack</b> were quickly blunted by the combined Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces in Quảng Ngãi Province. Recognising that he no longer has the manpower to mount a <b>counter-attack,</b> General Nhut ordered his troops to abandon Tra Bong and Son Ha, and concentrate his units in Tam Kỳ and Chu Lai instead.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} on 9 June, a Royalist force led by Sir Michael Woodhouse {{attempted to}} recapture the castle, now garrisoned by Parliament. The <b>counter-attack</b> was unsuccessful, ending in the rout of the Royalist forces in a skirmish at the nearby village of Wistanstow.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's troops {{launched}} a plundering raid into Austria in 1118, provoking a <b>counter-attack</b> by Leopold III, Margrave of Austria, {{later that same}} year. Bořivoj II, Duke of Bohemia, supported Leopold and pillaged the northwestern regions of the Kingdom of Hungary. Despite this, when Vladislaus I dethroned his brother Bořivoj in 1120, Bořivoj fled to Hungary and settled at Stephen's court.|$|E

5|$|The 39th and 2/14th Infantry Battalions withdrew {{south along}} the track {{on the western side}} of Eora Creek, passing through the 53rd which was holding Alola. The 2/16th withdrew south from Abuari along the eastern side of Eora Creek. Withdrawing in contact, several groups of Australians– {{including}} the 2/14th's headquarters company– found themselves isolated from the main body of Maroubra Force. In the confusion, an Australian <b>counter-attack</b> against the 3/144th caught a group of their own troops in a fierce crossfire. Although the <b>counter-attack</b> was ultimately successful in breaking through the Japanese blocking force, it also forced a large group of Australians off the track. Over several days large numbers trekked through the jungle in an effort to rejoin their units. Several were captured by the Japanese in the days that followed, including Key, who was executed by the Japanese after interrogation.|$|E
5|$|The 85th Paratrooper Battalion, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Colonel 'Atef Monsif, {{had been involved}} in a recent <b>counter-attack</b> against Deversoir. Despite breaking through in certain areas and even seizing part of the airstrip at Deversoir, the paratroopers and their supporting armor were greatly outnumbered and the <b>counter-attack</b> failed. The battalion suffered around a hundred dead, missing or wounded, and by dawn on October 18 it had been pulled back to Inshas Military Base for reorganizing. The only other Egyptian forces in the area were commandos, the 73rd Battalion of the 129th Sa'iqa (lightning) Group. The Sa'iqa had also been engaged in heavy fighting at Serabaeum, Deversoir and the nearby military base of Abu Sultan. By late October 17, the battalion's two companies had been ordered to withdraw from the vicinity of Deversoir northward to defend Serabaeum.|$|E
5000|$|Vella is {{a female}} swordsman who, like Lann, uses Twin Swords. She {{exhibits}} {{the power of}} wind, using it to slip directly through enemies, deflect most projectiles, and pull enemies into one spot, bolstering her <b>counter-attacking</b> ability. Although her play style seems identical to Lann, she has much less damage potential through normal and smash attacks, as her whole play style revolves around <b>counter-attacking.</b> Her alternate weapons are Chain Blades, a pair of chain whips with blades attached to them, allowing her to attack from great distances, restrain enemies, increasing her damage output, {{at the cost of}} <b>counter-attacking</b> abilities and decreased survival.|$|R
