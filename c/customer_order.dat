25|$|Only twenty MAC-145s were built, each to a {{specific}} <b>customer</b> <b>order,</b> a business strategy that insulated the Meyers company from the poor market conditions that bankrupted many small American aircraft manufacturers in the late 1940s. Production continued until 1955, and rights to the design were acquired by the Aero Commander division of Rockwell International in 1965 {{along with the rest}} of the Meyers company assets. The type was never produced by Rockwell, and the design again changed hands as part of the Meyers package when sold to Interceptor Corporation in 1968 and subsequently to Prop-Jets Inc in 1982.|$|E

40|$|In manual {{order picking}} systems, order pickers walk or ride through a {{distribution}} warehouse {{in order to}} collect items required by (internal or external) <b>customers.</b> <b>Order</b> batching consists of combining these – indivisible – <b>customer</b> <b>orders</b> into picking orders. With respect to order batching, two problem types can be distinguished: In off-line (static) batching all <b>customer</b> <b>orders</b> are known in advance. In on-line (dynamic) batching <b>customer</b> <b>orders</b> become available dynamically over time. This report considers an on-line order batching problem in which the total completion time of all <b>customer</b> <b>orders</b> arriving within a certain time period has to be minimized. The author shows how heuristic approaches for the off-line order batching can be modified {{in order to deal}} with the on-line situation. A competitive analysis shows that every on-line algorithm for this problem is at least 2 -competitive. Moreover, this bound is tight if an optimal batching algorithm is used. The proposed algorithms are evaluated in a series of extensive numerical experiments. It is demonstrated that the choice of an appropriate batching method can lead to a substantial reduction of the completion time of a set of <b>customer</b> <b>orders.</b> Warehouse Management, Order Picking, Order Batching, On-line Optimization...|$|R

2500|$|Monitoring {{encompasses}} the tracking of individual processes, so that {{information on their}} state can be easily seen, and statistics {{on the performance of}} one or more processes can be provided.

2500|$|Another {{possible}} classification is {{one based}} on Lead Time (manufacturing lead time vs delivery lead time): engineer to order (ETO), purchase to order (PTO), make to order (MTO), assemble to order (ATO) and make to stock (MTS). According to this classification different kinds of systems will have different <b>customer</b> <b>order</b> decoupling points (CODP), meaning that work in progress (WIP) cycle stock levels are practically nonexistent regarding operations located after the CODP (except for WIP due to queues).

40|$|When a <b>customer</b> <b>orders</b> online, {{an online}} {{retailer}} assigns {{the order to}} one or more of its warehouses and/or drop-shippers to minimize procurement and transportation costs based on the available current information. However, this assignment is necessarily myopic because it cannot account for any subsequent <b>customer</b> <b>orders</b> or future inventory replenishment. We examine the benefits of periodically reevaluating these real-time assignments. We construct near-optimal heuristics for the reassignment for a large set of <b>customer</b> <b>orders</b> to minimize the total number of shipments. Finally, we present evidence of significant saving opportunities by testing the heuristics on order data from a major online retailer. online retailing, online order fulfillment, local search heuristics...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a mathematical model}} developed for the synthesis of optimal replenishment policies for items that experience lumpy demands. In order to avoid disrupting the inventory system, a cutoff point of w units is introduced such that the system would only satisfy routinely <b>customer</b> <b>orders</b> with transaction sizes {{less than or equal}} to w units. For <b>customer</b> <b>orders</b> with transaction sizes larger than w units, the system would only supply the cutoff amount (w units). The excess units would be refused. The control discipline is the (s, S) inventory policy with continuous review, and the nature of the <b>customer</b> <b>orders</b> is approximated by a discrete stuttering Poisson distribution. The optimal values of the control parameters, w, s and S, are determined. The theoretical results obtained are illustrated with a numerical example. © 1995. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
