5|$|Christian Tuxen Falbe, a Danish marine officer, was in Paris in January 1839 {{on behalf}} of <b>Crown</b> <b>Prince</b> Frederik when Louis Daguerre {{revealed}} the art of daguerreotyping.

Shortly afterwards, he returned to Copenhagen with a camera and a couple of his own daguerreotypes for the <b>Crown</b> <b>Prince</b> who, believing them to be of scientific importance, deposited them with Hans Christian Ørsted, one of Denmark's most prominent scientists. As a result of Ørsted's own interest in photography, the new art took on rapidly: the daguerreotypist Mads Alstrup (1809–76) opened Copenhagen's first photographic studio in 1842; and by 1850 there were over a hundred studios in Copenhagen and many more in the provinces.|$|E

5|$|In September 1676, a rebel army of 9,000 {{led by the}} Kraeng of Galesong {{crossed over}} from Madura to Java and later took Surabaya, the {{principal}} city of eastern Java. Mataram sent a large force, commanded by the <b>crown</b> <b>prince</b> (later Amangkurat II) to meet the rebels. A battle took place in Gegodog, east of Tuban, in 1676, resulting in the complete defeat of the much larger Mataram forces. The loyalist army was routed, the king's uncle Pangeran Purbaya was killed, and the <b>crown</b> <b>prince</b> fled to Mataram. The <b>crown</b> <b>prince</b> was blamed for this defeat due to his long wavering before attacking the rebels. In addition, there were rumours that he colluded with the enemy, which included his former protégé Trunajaya. In the {{few months after the}} victory in Gegodog, the rebels quickly took Javanese northern trading towns from Surabaya westward to Cirebon, including the towns of Kudus and Demak. The towns fell easily, partly because their fortifications had been destroyed due to their conquest by Sultan Agung about 50 years earlier. Only Jepara managed to resist capture, due to combined efforts of the new military governor and VOC forces who reinforced the town just in time. The rebellion spread inland when Raden Kajoran, Trunajaya's powerful father-in-law based to the east of the Mataram capital, joined the rebellion. Kajoran and Trunajaya's forces marched on the capital, but were repelled by loyalist forces.|$|E
