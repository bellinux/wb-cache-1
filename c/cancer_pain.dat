5|$|<b>Cancer</b> <b>pain</b> {{treatment}} aims {{to relieve}} pain with minimal adverse treatment effects, allowing the person a good {{quality of life}} and level of function and a relatively painless death. Though 80–90 percent of <b>cancer</b> <b>pain</b> can be eliminated or well controlled, nearly half of all people with <b>cancer</b> <b>pain</b> in the developed world and more than 80 percent of people with cancer worldwide receive less than optimal care.|$|E

40|$|The present {{paper is}} aimed at briefly {{presenting}} psychological factors involved in <b>cancer</b> related <b>pain</b> and what psychosocial interventions are efficient in reducing it. <b>Cancer</b> related <b>pain</b> is a complex experience and the most integrative and recommended approach is the biopsychosocial model. It has been proved that chronic pain is more strongly related to psychological factors than to treatment or illness related factors. Psychological factors influencing pain experience can be intuitively grouped starting with awareness of pain (i. e., attentional factor), then with evaluation of pain (i. e., cognitive factors) which is leading to feelings (i. e., emotional factors), and behaviours (i. e., coping strategies) regarding pain. Psychosocial interventions (i. e., skill based and education based interventions) have strong evidence that is effective in reducing <b>cancer</b> related <b>pain...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{presence}} of pain depends {{mainly on the}} location of the cancer and the stage of the disease. At any given time, about half of all people diagnosed with malignant <b>cancer</b> are experiencing <b>pain,</b> and two thirds of those with advanced <b>cancer</b> experience <b>pain</b> of such intensity that it adversely affects their sleep, mood, social relations and activities of daily living.|$|R
40|$|Pain {{acceptance}} {{has been}} associated with improved physical and psychosocial well-being in chronic non-malignant pain patients. However, its effects are unclear in <b>cancer</b> out-patients with <b>pain.</b> Our aim was to determine whether pain acceptance predicts reduced pain, pain interference with function, anxiety, and depression in cancer outpatients. We recruited 116 outpatients from a tertiary oncol-ogy center, with various types of <b>cancer</b> and <b>pain</b> levels. Patients completed the Brief Pai...|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the poor}} quality of most studies of {{complementary}} and alternative medicine {{in the treatment of}} <b>cancer</b> <b>pain,</b> {{it is not possible to}} recommend integration of these therapies into the management of <b>cancer</b> <b>pain.</b> There is weak evidence for a modest benefit from hypnosis; studies of massage therapy produced mixed results and none found pain relief after 4 weeks; Reiki, and touch therapy results were inconclusive; acupuncture, the most studied such treatment, has demonstrated no benefit as an adjunct analgesic in cancer pain; the evidence for music therapy is equivocal; and some herbal interventions such as PC-SPES, mistletoe, and saw palmetto are known to be toxic to some people with cancer. The most promising evidence, though still weak, is for mind-body interventions such as biofeedback and relaxation techniques.|$|E
5|$|Guidelines {{for the use}} {{of drugs}} in the {{management}} of <b>cancer</b> <b>pain</b> have been published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and others. Healthcare professionals have an ethical obligation to ensure that, whenever possible, the patient or patient's guardian is well-informed about the risks and benefits associated with their pain management options. Adequate pain management may sometimes slightly shorten a dying person's life.|$|E
5|$|Invasion of bone by {{cancer is}} the most common source of <b>cancer</b> <b>pain.</b> It is usually felt as tenderness, with {{constant}} background pain and instances of spontaneous or movement-related exacerbation, and is frequently described as severe.

40|$|Pain {{has been}} {{recognized}} as global public health concern [1] and inadequate pain management has been called public health crisis [2] with over six million people annually suffering across the world due to inaccessibility to controlled medications [3]. However, aggressively overcoming inadequacies in non-acute pain management has its costs too [4]; and societies that are at infantile stages in regards to managing these <b>pains</b> (chronic and <b>cancer</b> <b>pains)</b> in their patient population should not compare themselves with the fore-runners in pain management {{only in terms of}} per capita consumption of medicinal morphine equivalents [5] for pain relief...|$|R

5|$|The way {{a person}} {{responds}} to pain affects {{the intensity of}} their pain (moderately), the degree of disability they experience, {{and the impact of}} pain on their quality of life. Strategies employed by people to cope with <b>cancer</b> <b>pain</b> include enlisting the help of others; persisting with tasks despite pain; distraction; rethinking maladaptive ideas; and prayer or ritual.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{analgesia}} is {{the cheapest}} and simplest mode of delivery. Other delivery routes such as sublingual, topical, transdermal, parenteral, rectal or spinal {{should be considered}} if the need is urgent, or in case of vomiting, impaired swallow, obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption or coma. Current evidence for the effectiveness of fentanyl transdermal patches in controlling chronic <b>cancer</b> <b>pain</b> is weak but they may reduce complaints of constipation compared with oral morphine.|$|E
5|$|Some authors {{challenge}} {{the validity of}} the second step (mild opioids) and, pointing to their higher toxicity and low efficacy, argue that mild opioids could be replaced by small doses of strong opioids (with the possible exception of tramadol due to its demonstrated efficacy in <b>cancer</b> <b>pain,</b> its specificity for neuropathic pain, and its low sedative properties and reduced potential for respiratory depression in comparison to conventional opioids).|$|E

5|$|Systemic {{institutional}} {{problems in the}} delivery of pain management include lack of resources for adequate training of physicians, time constraints, failure to refer people for pain management in the clinical setting, inadequate insurance reimbursement for pain management, lack of sufficient stocks of pain medicines in poorer areas, outdated government policies on <b>cancer</b> <b>pain</b> management, and excessively complex or restrictive government and institutional regulations on the prescription, supply, and administration of opioid medications.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord can produce analgesia. First, the leads are implanted, guided by fluoroscopy and feedback from the patient, and the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy. If pain is reduced by more than half, the therapy is deemed to be suitable. A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath {{the skin of the}} upper buttocks, chest wall or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they are attached to the snugly fitting generator. It seems to be more helpful with neuropathic and ischemic pain than nociceptive pain, but current evidence is too weak to recommend its use in the treatment of <b>cancer</b> <b>pain.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pain is {{experienced}} by 53 {{percent of all}} people diagnosed with malignant cancer, 59 percent of people receiving anticancer treatment, 64 percent of people with metastatic or advanced-stage disease, and 33 percent of people after completion of curative treatment. Evidence for prevalence of pain in newly diagnosed cancer is scarce. One study found pain in 38 {{percent of people who}} were newly diagnosed, another found 35 percent of such people had experienced pain in the preceding two weeks, while another reported that pain was an early symptom in 18–49 percent of cases.

5|$|Psychosocial {{interventions}} {{affect the}} amount of pain experienced {{and the degree to}} which it interferes with daily life; and the American Institute of Medicine and the American Pain Society support the inclusion of expert, quality-controlled psychosocial care as part of <b>cancer</b> <b>pain</b> management. Psychosocial interventions include education (addressing among other things the correct use of analgesic medications and effective communication with clinicians) and coping-skills training (changing thoughts, emotions, and behaviors through training in skills such as problem solving, relaxation, distraction and cognitive restructuring). Education may be more helpful to people with stage I cancer and their carers, and coping-skills training may be more helpful at stages II and III.|$|E
5|$|The WHO {{guidelines}} recommend prompt {{oral administration}} of drugs when pain occurs, starting, {{if the person}} is not in severe pain, with non-opioid drugs such as paracetamol, dipyrone, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or COX-2 inhibitors. Then, if complete pain relief is not achieved or disease progression necessitates more aggressive treatment, mild opioids such as codeine, dextropropoxyphene, dihydrocodeine or tramadol are added to the existing non-opioid regime. If this is or becomes insufficient, mild opioids are replaced by stronger opioids such as morphine, while continuing the non-opioid therapy, escalating opioid dose until the person is painless or the maximum possible relief without intolerable side effects has been achieved. If the initial presentation is severe <b>cancer</b> <b>pain,</b> this stepping process should be skipped and a strong opioid should be started immediately in combination with a non-opioid analgesic.|$|E
25|$|Oxycodone is {{available}} as controlled-release tablet, {{intended to be}} taken every 12 hours. A 2006 review found that controlled-release oxycodone is comparable to instant-release oxycodone, morphine, and hydromorphone in management of moderate to severe <b>cancer</b> <b>pain,</b> with fewer side effects than morphine. The author concluded that the controlled release form is a valid alternative to morphine and a first-line treatment for <b>cancer</b> <b>pain.</b> In 2014, the European Association for Palliative Care recommended oral oxycodone as a second-line alternative to oral morphine for <b>cancer</b> <b>pain.</b>|$|E

40|$|Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is {{a potent}} neurotoxin {{responsible}} for many human intoxications and fatalities each year. The origin of TTX is unknown, but in the pufferfish, {{it seems to be}} produced by endosymbiotic bacteria that often seem to be passed down the food chain. The ingestion of contaminated pufferfish, considered the most delicious fish in Japan, is the usual route of toxicity. This neurotoxin, reported as a threat to human health in Asian countries, has spread to the Pacific and Mediterranean, due to the increase of temperature waters worldwide. TTX, {{for which there is no}} known antidote, inhibits sodium channel producing heart failure in many cases and consequently death. In Japan, a regulatory limit of 2 mg eq TTX/kg was established, although the restaurant preparation of “fugu” is strictly controlled by law and only chefs qualified are allowed to prepare the fish.
