40|$|The {{specificity}} {{and sensitivity}} of T-cell recognition {{is vital to}} the immune response. Ligand engagement with the T-cell receptor (TCR) results in the activation of a complex sequence of signalling events, both on the cell membrane and intracellularly.

Here we show, using a mathematical model, that these feedback loops can explain the ability of the TCR to discriminate between ligands with high specificity and sensitivity, as well as provide a mechanism for sustained signalling. The model also explains the recent counter-intuitive observation that endogenous 'null' <b>ligands</b> <b>can</b> <b>significantly</b> enhance T-cell signalling.

Homogenous di- and tetravalent dendrimers incorporating the α 7 -nicotinic receptor blocker α-conotoxin ImI (α-ImI) with polyethylene glycol spacers were {{designed and synthesized}} via a copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition of azide-modified α-ImI to an alkyne-modified polylysine dendron. NMR and CD structural analysis confirmed that each α-ImI moiety in the dendrimers had the same 3 D structure as native α-ImI. The binding of the α-ImI dendrimers to binding protein Ac-AChBP was measured by surface plasmon resonance and revealed enhanced affinity. Quantitative electrophysiology showed that α-ImI dendrimers had ∼ 100 -fold enhanced potency at hα 7 nAChRs (IC 50 = 4 nM) compared to native α-ImI (IC 50 = 440 nM). In contrast, no significant potency enhancement was observed at heteromeric hα 3 β 2 and hα 9 α 10 nAChRs.

With the use of Pd-catalysts these typically inert bonds can be activated and transformed into diverse functional groups and more complex products. Substrates with <b>coordinating</b> <b>ligands</b> <b>can</b> direct activation/functionalization to a specific C−H bond and help to overcome issues of site-selectivity. However, many functionalization reactions require high temperatures and forcing reaction conditions. Herein we report Pd-catalyzed C–H functionalization reactions with milder conditions {{as well as a}} mechanistic study to improve reaction conditions and increase understanding. Chapter 1 introduces these ideas with subsequent chapters devoted to the study of specific methodologies. Chapter 2 details the palladium-catalyzed C−H fluorination of 8 -methylquinoline derivatives with nucleophilic fluoride. This transformation involves the use of AgF as the fluoride source in combination with a hypervalent iodine oxidant. The scope and mechanism of the reaction are discussed. In an effort to explore conditions relevant for PET imaging, short reaction times were investigated for this transformation. Chapter 3 describes the development of a room-temperature ligand-directed C−H arylation reaction using aryldiazonium salts. This was achieved by the successful merger of palladium-catalyzed C−H functionalization and visible-light photoredox catalysis. The unusually mild conditions utilized in this transformation (room temperature, CH 3 OH solvent) are proposed to be due to the kinetically reactive aryl radical oxidants formed under the reaction conditions. This method is general for a variety of directing groups and tolerates many common functional groups. Chapter 4 explores the mechanism of a room temperature palladium-/iridium-catalyzed C−H arylation reaction using diaryliodonium salts as the aryl source. This use of visible-light photoredox catalysis in combination with palladium catalyzed C−H functionalization is interesting mechanistically, and could potentially lead to other functionalization reactivity through similar methods.

However, many therapies would benefit from the ability to target the Ad vector only to specific cells, such as tumor cells for cancer gene therapy. In this study, we investigated the utility of capsid protein IX (pIX) as a platform for the presentation of single-chain variable-fragment antibodies (scFv) and single-domain antibodies (sdAb) for virus retargeting. We show that scFv can be displayed on the capsid through genetic fusion to native pIX but that these molecules fail to retarget the virus, due to improper folding of the scFv. Redirecting expression of the fusion protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) results in correct folding of the scFv and allows it to recognize its epitope; however, ER-targeted pIX-scFv was incorporated into the Ad capsid at a very low level which was not sufficient to retarget virus infection. In contrast, a pIX-sdAb construct was efficiently incorporated into the Ad capsid and enhanced virus infection of cells expressing the targeted receptor. Taken together, our data indicate that pIX is an effective platform for presentation of large targeting polypeptides {{on the surface of the}} virus capsid, but the nature of the <b>ligand</b> <b>can</b> <b>significantly</b> affect its association with virions...|$|R

40|$|Biological {{systems can}} often drive complex {{chemical}} transformations {{under mild conditions}} (e. g., aqueous solution, physiological pH, room temperature and atmospheric pressure), which is difficult to achieve in conventional chemical reactions. This unique ability is generally empowered {{by a series of}} synergistic protein catalysts that can facilitate reaction cascades through complex metabolic pathways. There is significant interest in exploring molecular assemblies and/or conjugated catalytic systems as analogs to the functional proteins that can facilitate chemical transformation under biologically mild conditions. Hemin, the catalytic center for many protein families including cytochromes, peroxidases, myoglobins and hemoglobins, can catalyze a variety of oxidation reactions like peroxidase enzymes. However, direct application of hemin as an oxidation catalyst is a significant challenge because of its molecular aggregation in aqueous solution to form catalytic inactive dimers and oxidative self-destruction in the oxidizing media, which causes passivation of its catalytic activity. In the first part of my thesis, we employed the graphene supported hemin as a high efficient peroxidase-mimic catalyst, showing with exceptionally high catalytic activity (kcat) and substrate binding affinity (KM) approaching that of natural enzymes. The second part of my thesis, we conjugate enzymatic catalyst glucose oxidase (GOx) to the graphene-hemin conjugate. The graphene-hemin-GOx catalyst can readily enable the continuous generation of nitroxyl, an antithrombotic species, from physiologically abundant glucose and L-arginine. We also demonstrate the conjugates can be embedded within polyurethane to create a novel, long-lasting antithrombotic coating for blood contacting biomedical devices. The last part of my thesis, we developed palladium particles with specially engineered ligands to mimic the catalytic cycle of hemin using oxygen as oxidant for ketone dehydrogenative oxidation reaction. By varying the ligands, yield was optimized to 93 %, much higher than 1. 5 % reported previously, exhibiting good heterogeneity and recyclability.

40|$|Copper is an {{essential}} element for primary productivity in the ocean. However, at concentrations observed surface seawater, copper likely would be toxic to most microbiota if not buffered by a pool of mostly unidentified ligands. These compounds of presumed biological origin can reduce toxicity either by being directly exuded to chelate extracellular bioavailable copper, or by mitigating the toxic effect of copper inside the cell via complexation and subsequent export. This dissertation examines the role of thiols, a presumed component of this pool of ligands, in maintaining copper homeostasis in marine algae. Stability constants of Cu(I) complexes with cysteine, glutathione, Arg-Cys, and Gln-Cys were measured using a new analytical method that employs fluorescent ion indicators and minimized oxidation of Cu(I). Computational methods were used to support reported constants. Speciation models predict that while thiolate <b>ligands</b> <b>can</b> <b>significantly</b> buffer intracellular copper, at concentrations typically observed in surface seawater, their effect on lowering copper is negligible. Uptake experiments {{in the presence of}} thiols confirmed speciation predictions. Thiols were only partially effective in reducing Cu(I) uptake, while the Cu(II) ligands EDTA and GSSG were able to effectively block uptake. However, cysteine enhances copper uptake in copper-limited Emiliania huxleyi cells and can increase the bioavailability of copper bound to EDTA. The use of stable isotopes to measure direct uptake of copper {{in the absence of a}} ligand, revealed a constitutive copper efflux mechanism in the coccolithophore E. huxleyi. This mechanism allows E. huxleyi to maintain relatively low cellular levels under exposure to a wide range of high copper concentrations, while the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana only appears to employ export at higher concentrations. Cu-limitation minimizes efflux. These results suggest that E. huxleyi maintains low levels of cellular copper through an intracellular buffering and efflux mechanism. Such a mechanism would give E. huxleyi an ecological advantage in water prone to high copper, such as coastal and those experiencing an upwelling event. Results from a survey of marine algae and estuarine field measurements also demonstrate that the thiols Arg-Cys and Gln-Cys may be biologically and geographically widespread. 2018 - 01 - 2...|$|R

The excited-state absorption in the transient UV-visible spectra, associated with the 2, 2 ′-bipyridine radical anion, provides a robust marker for the MLCT excited state, while the transient Kβ x-ray emission spectra provide a clear measure of intermediate and high spin metal-centered excited states.

The luminescence lifetime of LaF 3 /Eu nanoparticles varied from 6. 5 to 7. 4 ms for nanoparticles with an average size of 7. 1 to 8. 4 nm. A significant reduction of the quenching from the surface of the nanoparticles was obtained by the synthesis of core-shell nanoparticles, in which a shell of LaF 3 was grown epitaxially around the doped core nanoparticles. This leads to an increase in the luminescence lifetime of the Eu 3 + ion and the observation of emissions from the 5 D 2 energy level, in addition to emissions from the 5 D 1 and 5 D 0 levels.

40|$|The {{stabilization}} of proteins {{by a variety}} of co-solvents can be related to their property of increasing the surface tension of water. It is demonstrated that, during the thermal unfolding of proteins, this increase of the surface tension can be overcome by the increase in the temperature of the solution at the midpoint of the transition, Tm, and the weak binding of co-solvent molecules. Three such co-solvents were studied: trehalose, lysine hydrochloride (LysHCl), and arginine hydrochloride (ArgHCl). Trehalose and LysHCl increase the midpoint of Tm. The increase of the surface tension by addition of trehalose is completely compensated by its decrease due to the increase in Tm. However, for LysHCl, the increase of the surface tension by the co-solvent is partly reduced by its binding to the protein. For trehalose, preferential interaction measurements with RNaseA demonstrate that it is totally excluded from the protein. In contrast, LysHCl gives evidence of binding to RNaseA. ArgHCl also increases the surface tension of water. Nevertheless, Tm of RNaseA decreases on addition of ArgHCl to the solution. Preferential interaction measurements showed very small values of preferential hydration of the native protein, indicating extensive binding of ArgHCl to the protein. During unfolding, the amount of additional ArgHCl binding is sufficiently large to counteract the surface tension effects, and the protein is destabilized. Therefore, although surface tension appears to be a critical factor in the {{stabilization of}} proteins, its increase by co-solvent does not ensure increased stabilization.

40|$|Rare earth element and yttrium (REEY) {{signatures}} in hydrothermal carbonate minerals {{are widely}} used proxies for studying hydrothermal mineralization. This review adopts a source–sink approach that synthesizes the current understanding of REEY mass transfer along the pathway of hydrothermal fluids. The merits of this process-centered approach are illustrated with representative examples, selected to disclose the interpretative possibilities and limitations of REEY studies on carbonates. The starting points for the source–sink approach are the major fluid reservoirs: seawater, magmatic water and meteoric water. The REEY are subsequently added or removed during fluid–rock interaction by mineral breakdown, alteration and precipitation. These reactions largely determine redox conditions, pH and the element composition in the resulting fluids. Efficient complexation at high temperatures critically enhances REEY solubility in hydrothermal fluids, while sorption along the pathway becomes increasingly irrelevant at higher temperatures. Chlorine and fluorine are light REE (LREE) -selective ligands, while hydroxide and carbonate are heavy REE (HREE) -selective. These <b>ligands</b> <b>can</b> <b>significantly</b> fractionate the REE if they are major species. Fractionation occurs both by selectively increasing the transport capacity along the pathway and by preferentially retaining certain REE during precipitation. Comparison of mineral solubilities indicates that monazite generally limits the REEY content along the fluid pathway. Coprecipitating phosphates are expected to significantly diminish REEY availability for hydrothermal carbonates. Nonetheless, the trivalent REEY are highly compatible in the calcite lattice, especially LREE. The incorporation of REEY during calcite precipitation is relatively insensitive to kinetics, and can show significant concentration variations on small scales. Post-depositional interaction with calcite-undersaturated fluids preferentially removes the most fluid-mobile REEY from the unaltered precipitate, in the order: Eu 2 + >> LREE 3 + > or > Ce 4 +, with Y 3 + > or ≈ Ho 3 +, depending on the reaction conditions. The main processes that determine REEY signatures in hydrothermal carbonate minerals are summarized {{in a number of}} flow charts that allow backtracking of their REEY characteristics along the fluid pathway. Application of this approach to some representative examples illustrates that pattern shape and anomalies can provide useful information on hydrothermal processes and conditions. The process-centered approach is especially useful in multiphase systems, where interpretation of pattern shape and Ce, Eu and Y anomalies can be ambiguous, even when abundant information from other methods is available. Presently, there is no consensus on an explanation for the commonly observed strong LREE depletion in hydrothermal carbonates compared to crustal reservoirs. We speculate that REEY solubility control by strongly LREE-selective phosphates such as monazite and by carbonates along the pathway significantly contributes to this strong LREE depletion. Ultimately, the observed pattern shape and anomalies are a function of many superimposed processes, all of which should be considered, taking into account the constraints provided by other methods. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Inspired by nature’s use of self-assembled {{systems to}} carry out {{virtually}} all biological processes, chemists have taken to building simplified synthetic systems that mimic the biotic world. Although transition metal-ligand interactions are rarely used {{for the purpose of}} biological self-assembly, they have several advantages over other weak noncovalent interactions, such as pronounced directionality and significant strength. These particular attributes have allowed chemists to construct a comprehensive library of self-assembled polygons and polyhedra, using different transition metal-ligand motifs. Many of these supramolecular assemblies possess cavities of defined shape and size, which are able to accommodate guest molecules. It has further been realised that isolation of guest species from the bulk phase can lead to many interesting functions, such as containment, sensing and catalysis. Herein, a new self-assembly strategy has been used to construct novel cyclometalated Pt cages and assembly of the first known [Ir(ppy) 2]-based capsule has also been achieved. Chapter 1 includes an introduction to metallosupramolecular assemblies, followed by a comprehensive review of three-dimensional architectures with accessible cavities, their synthetic strategies and applications. Chapter 2 reports on the construction of novel Pt(II) -based trigonal prisms using an unusual, kinetically controlled protocol. By exploiting asymmetric cyclometalated 2 -phenylatopyridine based platinum corner units that possess both labile and non-labile cis-coordination sites, trigonal prismatic stereoisomeric architectures have been selectively prepared by altering the sequence of addition of ditopic 4, 4 ′-bipy (4, 4 ′-bipyridine) and tritopic tpt (2, 4, 6 -tris(4 -pyridyl) - 1, 3, 5 -triazine) molecular structural components using a template free method. Collision-induced-dissociation mass spectrometry experiments were used to differentiate between the structural isomers due to their significantly different fragmentation profiles. Chapter 3 describes the synthesis and characterisation of the first molecular capsule based on an [Ir(ppy) 2]+ 90 ° metallosupramolecular acceptor unit. Initial work focused on pyridine-based donor ligands from which an Ir 2 L 2 metallamacrocycle was assembled. However, when the highly conjugated tpt “panels” were used, due to postulated constraints in the dihedral angle, self-assembly of the Ir 6 tpt 4 octahedral was unsuccessful. The constraints in the dihedral angle were eliminated by swapping pyridine for nitrile-based ligands and following the development of a method to resolve rac-[(Ir(ppy) 2 Cl) 2] into its enantiopure forms, homochiral Ir 6 tcb 4 (tcb = 1, 3, 5 -tricyanobenzene) octahedral capsules where realised. Photophysical studies on the Ircapsules have shown that the ensemble of cooperative, weakly <b>coordinating</b> <b>ligands</b> <b>can</b> lead to luminescence not present in the comparative mononuclear analogues. X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the Ir capsules possess cavities large enough to accommodate 4 triflate counterions. Through a series of titration experiments the ability of the capsules to act as anion sensors was also exposed. Further exploration into the host-guest chemistry of the Ir 6 tcb 4 capsule is reported in Chapter 4. Subsequent experiments have shown that self-assembly is highly dependent on the counterions associated with the system. While a number of different anions (OTf-, BF 4 -, ClO 4 -, PF 6 -) facilitate the formation of the same octahedral scaffold, when triflimide was employed as a bulkier counterion, no capsule was observed. On subsequent addition of smaller counterions, such as triflate, the same Ir 6 tcb 4 cage assembles, demonstrating that the anions also act as templates. Kinetic stability experiments, undertook by monitoring the rate of scrambling of the Δ and Λ-[Ir(ppy) 2]+ components within the preformed ensembles, show that the Ir capsules are up to 1. 4 × 104 times more stable than their mononuclear analogues. The counter anions were also observed to {{play a crucial role in}} the capsule’s stability with measured scrambling half-lives ranging from 4. 7 mins with tetrafluoroborate to as long as 4. 5 days with triflate. In contrast, the rate of ligand exchange in simple mononuclear complexes, as ascertained using EXSY NMR experiments, was found to be approximately independent of the associated anion...|$|R
