40|$|When a {{convertible}} debt instrument {{is converted to}} equity securities, sometimes the terms of conversion provide that any accrued but unpaid interest at the date of conversion is forfeited by the former debt holder. This occurs either because the <b>conversion</b> <b>date</b> falls between interest payment dates or {{because there are no}} interest payment dates (a zero coupon convertible instrument). The issues are (1) whether interest expense should be accrued or imputed to the date of conversion when such forfeiture occurs and (2) if interest is accrued through the date of conversion, how the forfeited interest should be recorded upon conversion of the debt instrument. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that interest should be accrued or imputed to the date of conversion of the debt instrument. Accrued interest from the last interest payment date, if applicable, to the date of conversion, net of related income tax effects, if any, should be charged to interest expense and credited to capital as part of the cost of securities issued. Thus, the accrued interest is accounted for {{in the same way as}} the principal amount of the debt converted and any unamortized issue premium or discount; the net carrying amount of the debt, including any unamortized premium or discount and the related accrual for interest to the date of conversion, net of any related income tax effects, is a credit to the capital of the enterprise...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} whether payment {{of primary care}} physicians based on capitation, with an additional incentive payment for low hospital-utilization rates, resulted in lower hospital-utilization rates among patients of these physicians than among patients of physicians still paid on a fee-for-service basis. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Capitation-based and fee-for-service primary care practices in Ontario. SUBJECTS: Thirty-nine physicians whose method of payment was converted from fee-for-service to capitation {{during the period from}} June 1985 to January 1989 and 7 physicians who remained in fee-for-service practice, two of whom were matched with one physician in capitation-based practice on the basis of practice location, type of practice (academic v. community), hours of practice (part-time v. full-time), years since graduation, physician group size, practice size (number of patients), type of group (primary care v. multispecialty), sex, certification in family medicine, country of graduation (Canada v. other) and age. One physician in capitation-based practice was matched with only one physician in fee-for-service practice. OUTCOME MEASURES: Annual hospital-utilization rates (hospital separations or hospital days per 1000 patients in each practice) for the physicians paid on a capitation basis 3 years before, 1 year before and 3 years after they converted from fee-for-service payment and at corresponding periods for the matched physicians still paid on a fee-for-service basis. RESULTS: The mean annual rate of hospital days used, adjusted for the age and sex of patients as well as for their social-program-recipient status, fell from 1085 per 1000 patients (3 years before the <b>conversion</b> <b>date)</b> to 1030 (1 year before conversion) and to 954 (3 years after conversion) in capitation-based practices. For the matched physicians in fee-for-service practice, the rates during the corresponding periods were 1085, 1035 and 956 hospital days per 1000 patients. The pattern was similar for rates of hospital separations, adjusted for patient's age, sex and social-program-recipient status. There were no statistically significant differences between the rates of hospital utilization among patients of physicians in capitation-based practices and the rates among those of physicians in fee-for-service practices during each of the three periods, nor were there significant differences in the changes in rates. CONCLUSION: Capitation payment, with an additional incentive payment to encourage low hospital-utilization rates, did not reduce hospital use. Factors other than the method of physician payment appear to be responsible for the variations in hospital utilization among practices...|$|E

40|$|Since {{over half}} a century, Europe has been {{undergoing}} periurbanization; this phenomenon is similar to suburbanisation or sprawl in the U. S. Hence, for each plot of land, there is competition for land use (agriculture, urbanisation). We here study the effect of urban sprawl {{on the price of}} farmland in Belgium. Using a set of very traditional urban economics variables, we show that the determinants of residential prices also explain the spatial variation of farmland. Indeed, the prospect of conversion from agriculture to residential land uses are high in Belgium, which is a densely inhabited country characterized by a tight urban network and where, moreover, land zoning is permissive. Therefore, urban sprawl largely dominates residential choice since over 40 years leading to fragmented landscapes where agriculture coexists with housing. We here use the Capozza & Hesley (1989) model that was recently developed by Plantinga & Miller (2001) and Cavailh 9 s & Wavresky (2003). This model aims at analyzing urban growth from a microeconomic point of view, where agricultural land is converted in residential plot. Until conversion, the price of farmland is equal to the capitalization of the agricultural land rent; after conversion it is equal to the capitalization of the residential rent. It basically depends upon the commuting distance and the anticipated date of conversion (other determinants are also discussed: Ricardian land fertility, number of inhabitants of the township, income, border effects leading to discontinuities, etc.) A hedonic log-linear equation is used where spatial autocorrelation is controlled by Anselins method (1988) and the multicollinearity (if any) by partial least squares (PLS). The same econometric equation is estimated for both developable and agricultural land price. Data were aggregated {{at the level of the}} 589 municipalities and made available for an 11 years period (1995 - 2005). Data are mainly provided by the Belgian National Institute of Statistics (SPF 2 ̆ 026 conomie - Direction G 9 n 9 rale Statistiques) : for all communes we know the price, surface and the number of transactions per year, for both developable land (but not yet developed) and farmland (meadow and arable land). Distance between the centro 4 d of a commune and the centro 4 d of the closest hub-city is the shortest road distance computed on the real road network (see Vandenbulcke et al., 2007, for more details). Econometric findings show that R 2 values are slightly better for developable land (R 2 = 0, 92) than for farmland (R 2 = 0, 86), but that the partial R 2 value associated to urban influence variables is better for farmland (0, 85) than for developable land (0, 38) 3. The explanation of this paradox can be theoretical (combined effect of distance and anticipated land <b>conversion</b> <b>date),</b> as well as empirical (due to data imperfections: data are aggregated by municipalities). Results also reveal that agricultural prices decrease with distance from job centres and increase with the demographic size of the commune, with population rate of increase, households income as well as with the contiguity to the coastline. The same variables enter the regression estimated with residential land price. Figure 1 (provisional results) shows the relationship between the slope of land price according to distance to urban centres (CBD) in the 25 urban areas, for farmland as well as developable land. Explaining farmland slope (dependent variable, y-axis) by developable land slope (explanatory variable, x-axis) indeed leads to a high determination coefficient (R 2 = 0, 62) ...|$|E
40|$|A 15. 5 -mile {{portion of}} the I- 85 high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane in the {{metropolitan}} area of Atlanta, GA was converted to a high-occupancy toll (HOT) lane as part of a federal demonstration project designed to provide a reliable travel option through this congested corridor. Results from the I- 85 demonstration project provided insight into the results that may follow the Georgia Department of Transportation's planned implementation of a $ 16 billion HOT lane network along metropolitan Atlanta's other major roadways [2]. To evaluate the impacts of the conversion, it was necessary to measure changes in corridor travel speed, reliability, vehicle throughput, passenger throughput, lane weaving, and user demographics. To measure such performance, a monitoring project, led by the Georgia Institute of Technology collected various forms of data through on-site field deployments, GDOT video, and cooperation from the State Road and Toll Authority (SRTA). Changes in the HOT lane's speed, reliability or other performance measure can affect the demographic and vehicle characteristics of those who utilize the corridor. The purpose of this particular study was to analyze the changes to the vehicle characteristics by comparing vehicle occupancy, vehicle classifications, and vehicle registration data to their counterparts from before the HOV-to-HOT conversion. As part of the monitoring project, the Georgia Tech research team organized a two-year deployment effort to collect data along the corridor during morning and afternoon peak hours. One year of data collection occurred before the <b>conversion</b> <b>date</b> to establish a control and a basis from which to compare any changes. The second year of data collection occurred after the conversion to track those changes and observe the progress of the lane's performance. While on-site, researchers collected data elements including visually-observed vehicle occupancy, license plate numbers, and vehicle classification [25]. The research team obtained vehicle records by submitting the license plate tag entries to a registration database [26]. In previous work, vehicle occupancy data were collected independently of license plate records used to establish the commuter shed. For the analyses reported in this thesis, license plate data and occupancy data were collected concurrently, providing a link between occupancy records of specific vehicles and relevant demographic characteristics based upon census data. The vehicle records also provided characteristics of the users' vehicles (light-duty vehicle vs. sport utility vehicle, model year, etc.) that the researchers aggregated to identify general trends in fleet characteristics. The analysis reported in this thesis focuses on identifying changes in vehicle characteristics that resulted from the HOV-to-HOT conversion. The data collected from post-conversion are compared to pre-conversion data, revealing changes in vehicle characteristics and occupancy distributions that most likely resulted from the implementation of the HOT lane. Plausible reasons affecting the vehicle characteristics alterations will be identified and further demographic research will enhance the data currently available to better pinpoint the cause and effect relationship between implementation and the current status of the I- 85 corridor. Preliminary data collection outliers were identified by using vehicle occupancy data. However, future analysis will reveal the degree of their impact on the project as a whole. Matched occupancy and license plate data revealed vehicle characteristics for HOT lane users as well as indications that the tested data collectors are predominantly synchronized when concurrently collecting data, resulting in an argument to uphold the validity of the data collection methods. Chapter two provides reasons for why HOT lanes were sought out to replace I- 85 's HOV lanes. Chapter two will also provide many details regarding how the HOT lanes function and it will describe the role the Georgia Institute of Technology played in the assessment the HOV-to-HOT conversion. Chapter three includes the methodologies used to complete this document while chapter four provides results and analysis for the one year period before the conversion and the one year period after the conversion.
