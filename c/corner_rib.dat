50|$|San Baudelio de Berlanga is a {{relatively}} plain building on the outside, being mostly square with a small, nearly square apse adjoining its east side. The walls of the entire structure are made of rough native stone, and its exterior offers no decoration whatsoever. The interior, however, is very distinctive, and {{has been described as}} “The most Mohammedan church in the whole of Spain.”The entrance to San Baudelio de Berlanga is a single horseshoe-arched door on the north wall of the building, which leads directly into the nave of the church. Upon entering the hermitage, visitors are greeted by a large circular pillar that rises to the vaults of the apse. From the top of the pillar project eight ribbed arches, which are supported at the four corners and middle of the walls of the church. These arches are horseshoe forms with <b>corner</b> <b>ribs</b> supported by small Moorish inspired squinches.|$|R

40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to The University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Medicine. The objective of this project was to review skeletal survey reports and examine the differences in reporting of non-accidental trauma in patients with similar radiological findings. The overall purpose of this project {{is to develop a}} standardized reporting system for radiological findings suspicious for non-accidental trauma. Ten years’ worth of skeletal survey reports were obtained on over 1, 500 pediatric patients. These reports were individually reviewed and their findings were categorized in a table separating findings suspicious for non-accidental trauma. After data collection, analysis was completed to inspect the consistency of reports amongst studies with similar fractures specifying non-accidental trauma. The comparison was made between reports containing long bone fractures, metaphyseal <b>corner</b> fractures, <b>rib</b> fractures, or any combination of these. It was concluded that there are inconsistencies in reporting of non-accidental trauma in reports with similar patterns of these fractures. We propose a Skeletal Survey – Reporting and Data System (SS-RADS) score which will help radiologist standardize their reporting methods for more consistent interpretations and clinical outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic ranging sensors are inexpensive, have no moving parts, have no lenses to clean, are {{normally}} small and unobtrusive, and can measure distances through moderate amounts of dust, smoke, and humidity, {{so they are}} well suited to underground mines. In the work reported here, conducted by the U. S. Bureau of Mines, researchers tested ultrasonic ranging sensors for their abiity to define rib line features for computer-aided navigation of underground mine mobile equipment. The investigation began with laboratory tests of field of view, angle of incidence, intersensor variation, and ranging accuracy of the individual rangers in a ring array produced by Denning Robotics of Wilmington, MA. The {{results showed that the}} sensors have good accuracy and low variability. Additional experiments at AMAX's Henderson Mine showed the sensors could accurately and reliably measure the distance to mine features, including convex and concave <b>corners</b> and <b>rib</b> intersections. The results showed that when used properly, the ranger data are accurate enough for reliable mine vehicle navigation When used incorrectly, ultrasonic rangers do not provide the anticipated data. Therefore, this report explains the principles of ultrasonic range measurement, describes the ranger's strengths and weaknesses, and explains proper ranger use and data analysis...|$|R
5000|$|The top, {{back and}} ribs of an {{acoustic}} guitar body are very thin (1-2 mm), so a flexible {{piece of wood}} called lining is glued into the <b>corners</b> where the <b>rib</b> meets the top and back. This interior reinforcement provides 5 to 20 mm of solid gluing area for these corner joints. Solid linings are often used in classical guitars, while kerfed lining is most often found in steel string acoustics. Kerfed lining is also called kerfing because it is scored, or [...] "kerfed"(incompletely sawn through), {{to allow it to}} bend with the shape of the rib). During final construction, a small section of the outside corners is carved or routed out and filled with binding material on the outside corners and decorative strips of material next to the binding, which are called purfling. This binding serves to seal off the end grain of the top and back. Purfling can also appear on the back of an acoustic guitar, marking the edge joints of the two or three sections of the back. Binding and purfling materials are generally made of either wood or plastic.|$|R
50|$|Its high {{fortified}} {{walls and}} occasional bastions were encroached upon, destruction, defacement of different structures {{and changes in}} internal spaces, had put the fort in a sorry state. The two-storied diwan block was partly damaged; bathhouse, niches were filled in, and decorative panels were mostly plastered over. The DOA accomplished {{a good job in}} restoring the structure and converting it into a museum in the first place, but the pinkish finish on the exterior, rather than the original lustrous white, fuelled debates and controversies. The elegance of its interior bespeaks the patron’s wealth. The mosque’s interior is divided into three bays by two lateral cusped arches supported by stone piers embedded in the east and west walls. yet the Directorate restored the dochala roof on the veranda at the south of the tomb and the decorative features like engaged corner turrets. This appears to be the first use of lateral cusped arches in a Bengali mosque’s interior, and was doubtless inspired by imperial mughal architecture. The central Mihrab, particularly noteworthy, is highly ornamented with Cyprus-filled kanjuras, ornate arabesque plastic relief in the spandrels, a cusped arch, and engaged colonettes standing on bulbous floral bases. Due east of the mosque is the small, square, single-domed tomb with engaged turrets at each corner. Attached to the Southside was a low rectangular chamber with a do-chala roof, now collapsed. While the purpose of this room is not clear, it perhaps served as a prototype for the more symmetrical tomb of khwaja anwar-i shahid in Burdwan. It reconstructed the brick podium and provided adequate provision for ablution, plumbing, and sanitation services. The front façade of the mosque has three arched openings within four slender columns; it also has four <b>corner</b> turrets, <b>ribbed</b> and engaged. In a way the other two mosques built slightly later than this one bear similar features, but in an improved form. It is something that we now identify as a distinct Mughal style in Bengal.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{studies are}} carried out to {{investigate}} the heat transfer characteristics involving an impinging jet with a shallow-angle in a crossflow. A rib is applied to control the jet impingement heat transfer Liquid crystal technique is employed to measure the wall temperature and obtain the heat transfer coefficients. In the study, the Reynolds number for the crossflow is 80, 000 and the Reynolds number for the jet ranges from 20, 000 to 40, 000. This {{gives rise to the}} jet-to-crossflow velocity ratio varying from 1. 4 to 2. 8. For all the tested cases, it is found that the presence of rib makes the Nusselt number profiles across the stagnation point change from a classical bell-shaped profile to a plateau-like pattern, indicating the enhanced heat transfer region expands more as the rib is present. In particular the presence of rib has a more pronounced effect on the enhancement of heat transfer at lower velocity ratio (R = 1. 4). However, in such case, the local heat transfer in the <b>rib</b> <b>corner</b> region deteriorates. At higher velocity ratio, especially at R = 2. 8, the presence of rib makes the heat transfer rate more uniform, but meanwhile, it is found that the impinging jet effect tends to be weake...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{studies are}} carried out to {{investigate}} the jet impingement heat transfer in crossflow by liquid crystal thermography (LCT). The aim is to assess the possibility of controlling heat transfer by using a rib. The crossflow Reynolds number spans from 80, 000 to 160, 000 and the velocity ratio ranges from 1. 0 to 2. 8. The {{results show that the}} presence of rib can significantly modify the heat transfer pattern of impinging jet. For all the tested cases, the presence of rib makes the Nusselt number profiles across the stagnation point change from a classical bell-shaped profile to a plateau-like pattern, indicating the enhanced heat transfer region expands more as the rib is present.

60|$|The sun was sinking when {{we heard}} the roar of falling waters {{and came to a}} broad river along whose banks we ran. And then--oh, then! I might at a pinch {{describe}} the infernal regions, but not the other place. Be it known to you that the Yellowstone River has occasion to run through a gorge about eight miles long. To {{get to the bottom of}} the gorge it makes two leaps, one of about one hundred and twenty and the other of three hundred feet. I investigated the upper or lesser fall, which is close to the hotel. Up to that time nothing particular happens to the Yellowstone, its banks being only rocky, rather steep, and plentifully adorned with pines. At the falls it comes round a <b>corner,</b> green, solid, <b>ribbed</b> with a little foam and not more than thirty yards wide. Then it goes over still green and rather more solid than before. After a minute or two you, sitting upon a rock directly above the drop, begin to understand that something has occurred; that the river has jumped a huge distance between solid cliff walls and what looks like the gentle froth of ripples lapping the sides of the gorge below is really the outcome of great waves. And the river yells aloud; but the cliffs do not allow the yells to escape.|$|R
40|$|Ó The Author(s) 2010. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background Osseous injuries {{are a major}} facet {{of child abuse and}} in most patients radiographic imaging {{plays a major role in}} diagnosis. While some injuries are typically produced as a result of excessive and inappropriate force other injuries are nonspecific in terms of their causation, but become suspicious when the history provided by the caretakers is inconsistent with the type of injury produced. Questions/purposes I detail the radiographic imaging of the more characteristic of the highly specific injuries, discuss the major issues that relate to some moderate- or lowspecificity injuries, and describe several diseases that mimic abuse. Methods A review of the current and recent literature focused on the radiographic imaging of child abuse was performed by searching the National Library of Medicine database at pubmed. gov. Keywords used included: radiology, fracture, child abuse, and/or nonaccidental trauma. Results Injuries that are highly specific for the diagnosis of abuse include metaphyseal <b>corner</b> fractures, posteromedial <b>rib</b> fractures, and sternal, scapular, and spinous process fractures. Lesions of moderate specificity include, among other injuries, multiple fractures of various ages and epiphyseal separations.

40|$|AbstractA {{distress}} {{was observed}} in a distortion screen during testing. This screen is positioned {{in front of an}} aero engine during testing to check the engine performance with a distorted air intake. To ensure a distorted air intake, the screen contains dense meshes in some areas whereas in other areas they are less dense. Non-uniformity in the mesh density results in distorted air flow into the engine thereby facilitating evaluation of the engine performance with disturbed aerodynamic inlet. The component, i. e. the distortion screen was under development and was subjected to aerodynamic tests on the test bench. It was found to have fractured from a rib connecting two meshes. Loose end of the mesh had detached and resulted in permanent deformation of the adjoining ribs and meshes. The fractured surface exhibited glossy crystalline appearance. Scanning electron microscope revealed striations at higher magnifications (> 500 X) as {{was observed in}} the case of fatigue failure. Two crack fronts were adjacent and near to one <b>corner</b> of the <b>rib,</b> and the third crack front had originated from the other corner placed diagonally opposite to the other two crack fronts. This observation indicated failure of the screen under reverse bending fatigue condition. Design and material condition were reviewed. After modification {{it was found that the}} newly modified distortion screen did not show any sign of deformation after testing...|$|R
