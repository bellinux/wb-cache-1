For myself, I own I would rather fight on foot than on horseback; I can trust myself better than I can trust my steed, <b>can</b> <b>wheel</b> thrice while he is turning once, can defend both sides equally well; whereas on horseback, not only have I to defend myself but my horse, which is far more difficult, and if he is wounded and falls I may be {{entangled}} under him and be helpless at the mercy of an opponent." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “No,” said Jonas; “so {{you must}} {{go up to the}} house and get a pretty long, narrow board, as long as you and Rollo can carry, and bring it down and lay it along {{on the top of the}} stones. Perhaps you will have to move the stones a little, so as to make it steady; and then you <b>can</b> <b>wheel</b> on that. If one board is not long enough, {{you must go}} and get two. And you must put them down on one side of the path, so that the stones will go into the middle of the path and upon the other side, so as not to cover up the board.|$|E
60|$|The {{reader is}} {{probably}} {{familiar with the}} structure of an ordinary astronomical observatory. The building is usually cylindrical in shape, with a very light hemispherical roof capable of being turned round from the interior. The telescope is supported upon a stone pillar in the centre, and a clockwork arrangement compensates for the earth's rotation, and allows a star once found to be continuously observed. Besides this, there is a compact tracery of wheels and screws about its point of support, by which the astronomer adjusts it. There is, of course, a slit in the movable roof which follows {{the eye of the}} telescope in its survey of the heavens. The observer sits or lies on a sloping wooden arrangement, which he <b>can</b> <b>wheel</b> to any part of the observatory as the position of the telescope may require. Within it is advisable to have things as dark as possible, in order to enhance the brilliance of the stars observed.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{astonishing}} how great an influence may be exerted over a child, by his simply knowing that his efforts are observed and appreciated. You pass {{a boy in}} the street, wheeling a heavy load, in a barrow; now simply stop to look at him, with a countenance which says, [...] "that is a heavy load; I should not think that boy could wheel it;" [...] and how quick will your look give fresh strength and vigor to his efforts. On the other hand, when, in such a case, the boy is faltering under his load, try the effect of telling him, [...] "Why, that is not heavy; you <b>can</b> <b>wheel</b> it easily enough; trundle it along." [...] The poor boy will drop his load, disheartened and discouraged, and sit down upon it, in despair. No, even if the work you are assigning to a class is easy, do not tell them so, unless you wish to destroy all their spirit and interest in doing it; and {{if you wish to}} excite their spirit and interest, make your work difficult, and let them see that you know it is so. Not so difficult as to tax their powers too heavily, but enough so, to require a vigorous and persevering effort. Let them distinctly understand too, that you know it is difficult,--that you mean to make it so,--but that they have your sympathy and encouragement, in the efforts which it calls them to make.|$|E

50|$|Biliblankets {{offer the}} {{possibility}} of treating some degrees of jaundice at home {{as long as the}} baby is otherwise healthy. This makes them quite popular with parents, doctors, and insurance companies, who would otherwise have to pay for more expensive inpatient treatment. Some also consider it a better option because the newborn {{does not have to be}} separated from the parents and does not need to lie alone in a box with his or her eyes covered. The baby is tied to the machine, unless they <b>can</b> <b>wheel</b> it around, and there is a stiff pad between the mother and baby. While this is an inconvenience, most see it as a lesser of two evils.|$|E
5000|$|Bob {{becomes an}} {{excellent}} and popular teacher around the school. However, {{the popularity of}} the new [...] "Home-Ec-staurant" [...] draws business away from the school cafeteria, which threatens the lunch ladies, who are independently contracted through Caf Co. Food Services. The head lunch lady, Hildy, begins menacing Bob, finally taking him to a secret meeting with her boss, who tells Bob that he is in violation of Caf Co.'s contract with the school. He has arranged for Bob to be fired. As he packs his things, the students plead with him to stay and teach them again, but Mr. Frond instructs him to go. In a show of solidarity, the students stand on their desks and rip open bags of unpopped microwavable popcorn. Bob, inspired, decides that they should go out with a bang and serve one last meal to the student body. Using a push cart and a portable grill, they make a mobile hamburger stand that they <b>can</b> <b>wheel</b> to the cafeteria. As they run down the hall, Bob only then realizes that Tina transferred and feels terrible that he ignored her. He finds her at shop class and apologizes, and she joins him and the other students. The hamburger cart is too popular for Caf Co. to stop, so they give up, as Bob and Tina share the final Home-Ec-staurant meal together.|$|E

40|$|Inspired by {{the aerial}} {{maneuvering}} ability of lizards, we present {{the design and}} control of MSU (Michigan State University) tailbot—a miniature-tailed jumping robot. The robot can not only wheel on the ground, but also jump up to overcome obstacles. Moreover, once leaping into the air, it can control its body angle using an active tail to dynamically maneuver in midair for safe landings. We derive the midair dynamics equation and design controllers, such as a sliding mode controller, to stabilize the body at desired angles. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first miniature (maximum size 7. 5 cm) and lightweight (26. 5 g) robot that <b>can</b> <b>wheel</b> on the ground, jump to overcome obstacles, and maneuver in midair. Furthermore, tailbot is equipped with on-board energy, sensing, control, and wireless communication capabilities, enabling tetherless or autonomous operations. The robot in this paper exemplifies the integration of mechanical design, embedded system, and advanced control methods that will inspire the next-generation agile robots mimicking their biological counterparts. Moreover, it can serve as mobile sensor platforms for wireless sensor networks with many field applications. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
