50|$|Accountants in the United Kingdom and the United States have {{discussed}} the effect of inflation on financial statements since the early 1900s, beginning with index number theory and purchasing power. Irving Fisher's 1911 book The Purchasing Power of Money {{was used as a}} source by Henry W. Sweeney in his 1936 book Stabilized Accounting, which was about Constant Purchasing Power Accounting. This model by Sweeney was used by The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for their 1963 research study (ARS6) Reporting the Financial Effects of Price-Level Changes, and later used by the Accounting Principles Board (USA), the Financial Standards Board (USA), and the Accounting Standards Steering Committee (UK). Sweeney advocated using a price index that covers everything in the gross national product. In March 1979, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) wrote <b>Constant</b> <b>Dollar</b> Accounting, which advocated using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) to adjust accounts because it is calculated every month.|$|E
5000|$|Another highly {{influential}} {{figure was}} chief engineer Welko Gasich, who convinced Schmued that the engines must be {{located within the}} fuselage for maximum performance. Gasich also {{for the first time}} introduced the concept of [...] "life cycle cost" [...] into fighter design, which provided the foundation for the F-5's low operating cost and long service life. The low costs involved has been recognized as an important element of the aircraft's effectiveness; defense analyst and combat aircraft architect Pierre Sprey stated in a 1982 U.S. Department of Defense report that, [...] "Increases in cost and complexity that were unnecessary to enhance air-to-air effectiveness have decreased today's effective force size per <b>constant</b> <b>dollar</b> by factors of 25 to 75, relative to the F-86's 2000 sorties/day per billion dollars. The only exception to this strikingly adverse trend is the F-5E, which manages to produce 500 sorties/day per billion dollars." [...] The total cost of an F-5 sortie is approximately 20% that of an F-16 sortie, even though the F-16 is a cost effective modern fighter. This low cost was also a very deliberate strategy of Northrop in following a focused light fighter plan. A Northrop design study stated [...] "The application of advanced technology was used to provide maximum force effectiveness at minimum cost. This became the Northrop philosophy {{in the development of the}} T-38 and F-5 lightweight trainer and fighter aircraft." ...|$|E

40|$|US {{national}} healthcare expenditures (NHE) displayed cubic {{growth dynamics}} between 1960 and 2000. In any year, current NHE must equal population times {{consumer price index}} (CPI) times per capita CPI-adjusted <b>constant</b> <b>dollar</b> healthcare expenditures. Cubic growth dynamics are {{a consequence of the}} fact that essentially linear growth relationships were observed over time with total population, CPI, and per capita CPI-adjusted dollar healthcare expenditures. Similarly in any year, current private and public NHE must equal population times consumer price index (CPI) times private and public per capita CPI-adjusted <b>constant</b> <b>dollar</b> healthcare expenditures respectively. This study examined whether private and public per capita CPI-adjusted dollar healthcare expenditures displayed linear growth. Linear relationships were observed over this time period for both private per capita CPI-adjusted dollar healthcare expenditures and public per capita CPI-adjusted dollar healthcare expenditures. The finding that both of these factors were well described by linear equations suggests that that both private and public NHE growth should display cubic growth dynamics over time. From 1960 through 2000, cubic growth dynamics were observed for both private NHE and public NHE. This model suggests that shifting healthcare costs between the private and public domains will not alter the underlying cubic growth dynamics of U. S.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{pertains to}} {{the inability of the}} traditional historical cost financial statements of not-for-profit hospitals to reflect adequately the effects of changing prices. The possibility that this perceived deficiency might be alleviated is investigated by application of the FASB 2 ̆ 7 s Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 33 (FAS 33) supplementary changing prices information requirements (minimum disclosures required of large profit-seeking enterprises or optional comprehensive financial statements) to the conventional historical cost hospital financial statements. ^ The major research questions pursued are: (1) How would the conventional historical cost financial data of one specific hospital be changed by application of FAS 33 current cost and <b>constant</b> <b>dollar</b> models? and (2) What is the perceived impact of FAS 33 current cost and <b>constant</b> <b>dollar</b> data on the financial decisions of selected users of the financial statements of the hospital studied?^ The fiscal year 1980 conventional historical cost financial statements of a medium sized general hospital were converted, using indexation procedures, to financial statements reflecting three restated bases: (1) <b>constant</b> <b>dollar,</b> (2) current cost, and (3) current cost/constant dollar under the criteria of FAS 33. Several sets of data ranging from the FAS 33 minimum disclosure requirements under each model to full sets of comprehensive financial statements are presented and analyzed. In addition, the results of an interview with executives of the case study hospital are presented regarding their views of the perceived impact of FAS 33 data on their financial decisions. ^ This dissertation research study demonstrates that the FAS 33 minimum disclosure requirements and the optional comprehensive financial statement procedures can be feasibly applied to the conventional historical cost financial statements of not-for-profit hospitals. ...|$|E
40|$|U. S. {{national}} healthcare expenditures (NHE) {{increased from}} under 28 {{billion dollars in}} 1960 to over 1. 35 trillion dollars in 2000. This enormous growth threatens the sustainability of the provision of healthcare. By definition, in any year, current NHE must equal population times consumer price index (CPI) times per cap-ita CPI-adjusted <b>constant</b> <b>dollar</b> healthcare expenditures. Linear relationships were observed over time with total population (r 2 > 0. 99), with CPI (r 2 > 0. 96), and with per capita CPI-adjusted dollar healthcare expendi-tures (r 2 > 0. 98). The finding that those three factors were well described by linear equations suggests that NHE growth should display cubic dynamics over time. NHE from 1960 through 2000 did display cubic growth dynamics (r 2 > 0. 99). Moreover, actual NHE from 1960 through official U. S. government NHE pro-jections in 2019 also displayed cubic growth dynamics (r 2 > 0. 99). This model explains why U. S. NHE has displayed cubic growth dynamics and suggests that U. S.

40|$|During {{the past}} two decades, gross state product (GSP) {{has become a major}} {{indicator}} of state economic activity. GSP has great conceptual appeal with its definition being "the gross market value of the goods and services attributable to labor and property located in a state", (Renshaw, et. al., 1988, p. 30). Until the late 1980 s, GSP was not an official indicator released by a government agency. Rather, it was constructed by approximation techniques traceable to the work of Kendrick and Jaycox (1965). Since there was no official standard of computation, analysts were on their own to compute GSP accounts for their locale as they saw fit. The method proposed here for creating preliminary GSP estimates uses predictions from single equation models that relate official GSP estimates to either the synthetic GSP estimates of the corresponding industry or to selected components of the synthetic GSP estimates. Four prediction models for official GSP will be examined, one pertaining to current dollar GSP and the remaining three pertaining to <b>constant</b> <b>dollar</b> GSP.
