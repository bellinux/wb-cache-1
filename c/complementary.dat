40|$|Reciprocity {{laws and}} their residue symbols have {{applications}} {{not only in}} number theory but also in other fields like cryptography. In their effort to develop cryptosystems with security equivalent {{to the difficulty of}} integer factorization, mathematicians utilized these objects to develop such schemes in cyclotomic fields of degree λ− 1, where λ = 2, 3, and 5. A crucial part of such schemes is an efficient and fast residue symbol algorithm. Such algorithms were devised for λ = 2, 3, 5 but not for 7. Here we develop a fast and efficient residue symbol algorithm for λ = 7. We accomplish this by giving explicit conditions on integers in Q(ζ) (with ζ a primitive 7 th root of unity) to be primary, by formulating explicit forms of the <b>complementaries</b> to Kummer’s 7 th degree reciprocity law, and by using the norm-Euclidean algorithm in Q(ζ). We also reformulate the <b>complementaries</b> we obtain using Dickson’s system of quadratic Diophantine equations...|$|R

5|$|Cell {{division}} {{is essential for}} an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's <b>complementary</b> DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase. This enzyme makes the <b>complementary</b> strand by finding the correct base through <b>complementary</b> base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.|$|E

5|$|For most viruses with RNA genomes {{and some}} with {{single-stranded}} DNA genomes, the single strands {{are said to}} be either positive-sense (called the plus-strand) or negative-sense (called the minus-strand), depending on if they are <b>complementary</b> to the viral messenger RNA (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is <b>complementary</b> to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that the template strand for the viral mRNA is <b>complementary</b> to it (−), and the coding strand is a copy of it (+). However, several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are ambisense in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate. Examples include geminiviruses, which are ssDNA plant viruses and arenaviruses, which are ssRNA viruses of animals.|$|E

In this way, the differences, but also the <b>complementaries</b> between the different modeling methodologies are revealed.

Surprisingly, however, organizational economics (i. e., transaction cost economics, agency theory, team theory and property rights theory) has played no {{role in the development of}} knowledge management. We argue that organizational economics insights can further the theory and practice of knowledge management in several ways. Specifically, we apply notions of contracting, team production, <b>complementaries,</b> hold-up, etc. to knowledge management issues (i. e., creating and integration knowledge, rewarding knowledge workers, etc.), and derive refutable implications that are novel to the knowledge management field from our discussion.

40|$|This paper studies asset {{markets in}} which {{ambiguity}} averse investors face Knightian uncertainty about expected payoffs. The same investors, however, {{might wish to}} resolve their uncertainty, although not risk, by just purchasing information. In these markets, uninformed and, hence, ambiguity averse, agents may coexist with informed agents, {{as a result of}} a rational information acquisition process. Moreover, there are <b>complementaries</b> in information acquisition, multiplicity of equilibria, history-dependent prices, and large price swings occurring after small changes in the uncertainty surrounding the asset expected payoffs. Our model suggests the importance of uncertainty, as a new channel for episodes of extreme price volatility, media frenzies and media glooms. ...|$|R

5|$|Over 50% of MS {{patients}} may use <b>complementary</b> and alternative medicine, although numbers vary greatly {{depending on the}} definition of alternative medicine used.

The evidence for effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Examples of treatments used by patients include dietary supplementation and regimens such as vitamin D, calcium, vitamin B12, and antioxidants. The rationale behind the use of Vitamin D supplementation is that studies show an association between vitamin D deficiency and increasing progression of MS, as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D.|$|E
