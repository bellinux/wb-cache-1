25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the combination of early-onset <b>conduct</b> <b>disorder</b> and ADHD may be associated with life-course-persistent antisocial behaviors as well as psychopathy. There is evidence that this combination is more aggressive and antisocial than those with <b>conduct</b> <b>disorder</b> alone. However, it is not a particularly distinct group since the vast majority of young children with <b>conduct</b> <b>disorder</b> also have ADHD. Some evidence indicates that this group has deficits in behavioral inhibition, similar to that of adults with psychopathy. They may not be more likely than those with <b>conduct</b> <b>disorder</b> alone to have the interpersonal/affective features and the deficits in emotional processing characteristic of adult psychopaths. Proponents of different types/dimensions of psychopathy have seen this type as possibly corresponding to adult secondary psychopathy and increased disinhibition in the triarchic model.|$|E

The {{goal of this}} thesis is to map risk and dangerous factors and their influence {{in a context of}} socialization and look into its nature in relation to their acts of behavior.

Further, we concentrate on concrete elements of socialization, especially on family environment, school environment and peer groups. According to conduct behavior, we target the epidemiology and diagnostical criterions. We divide <b>conduct</b> <b>disorders</b> into <b>conduct</b> <b>disorders</b> with good prognosis and <b>conduct</b> <b>disorders</b> with bad prognosis and we describe these disorders.

40|$|Research {{assessing}} {{the role of}} marital variables {{in the treatment of}} childhood <b>conduct</b> <b>disorders</b> is scarce. The aim of this study was (a) fo assess the role of marital discord in the overall outcome of a program training parents in behavioral techniques (behavioral parent training) and (b) to assess the effects of an adjunctive treatment (partner support training [PST]) on outcome. The latter treatment focused on marital conflict, communication, and problem soiving. Twenty-four families with a child diagnosed as oppositional or <b>conduct</b> <b>disordered</b> were assigned to either a marital-discord group (n = 12) or a no-marital-discord group (n = 12). Families within each group were then randomly assigned to either child management training (CMT) alone or CMT with PST. Measures of child deviance, parenting behavior, and marital satisfaction were collected at pre- and posttraining and at a 6 -month foilow-up. Results indicated a significant interaction between marital discord and treat-ment type on most measures at follow-up but hOt at posttraining. Although PST added little to the maintenance of change for the nondiscordant group, it produced significant gains over those who received CMT only for the discordant group. Further results highlighting the interaction of marital and treatment variables are discussed. Considerable research has indicated that marital discord and child behavior problems, particularly <b>conduct</b> <b>disorders</b> in boys, covary in clinical samples and, to a lesser extent, in the general population (Emery, 1982). However, the role of marital variables in the treatment of <b>conduct</b> <b>disorders</b> has received far less attention.

25|$|Psychopathy is a {{personality}} disorder which has symptoms expressed {{over a wide}} range of settings. Socially, it expresses extensive callous and manipulative self-serving behaviors with no regard for others, and often is associated with repeated delinquency, crime and violence, but may also present itself in other, maybe even successful social settings. Mentally, impairments in processes related to affect (emotion) and cognition, particularly socially related mental processes, have been found in those with the disorder which suggest that their destructive social behavior is borne from these aberrant mental processes. Developmentally, symptoms of psychopathy have been identified in young children with <b>conduct</b> <b>disorder,</b> and is suggestive of at least a partial constitutional factor that influences its development.|$|E
25|$|According to Gillberg, {{clinically}} severe form DAMP (or ADHD+DCD) affects about 1.5% of {{the general}} population of school age children; another few per cent are affected by more moderate variants. Boys are overrepresented; girls are currently probably underdiagnosed. There are many overlapping conditions, including <b>conduct</b> <b>disorder,</b> depression/anxiety, and academic failure. There is a strong link with autism spectrum disorders in severe DAMP. Familial factors and pre- and perinatal risk factors account for much of the variance. Psychosocial risk factors appear to increase the risk of marked psychiatric abnormality in DAMP. Outcome in early adult age was psychosocially poor in one study in almost 60% of unmedicated cases. About half of all cases with ADHD have DCD, and conversely, ADHD occurs in about half of all cases of DCD.|$|E

In addition, CBT is recommended as {{the first line of}} treatment for the majority of psychological disorders in children and adolescents, including aggression and <b>conduct</b> <b>disorder.</b> Researchers have found that other bona fide therapeutic interventions were equally effective for treating certain conditions in adults, but CBT was found to be superior in treating most disorders.
