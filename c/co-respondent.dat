5|$|In 1869, Sir Charles Mordaunt, a British Member of Parliament, {{threatened}} to name Edward as <b>co-respondent</b> in his divorce suit. Ultimately, {{he did not}} do so but Edward was called as a witness in the case in early 1870. It was shown that Edward had visited the Mordaunts' house while Sir Charles was away sitting in the House of Commons. Although nothing further was proven and Edward denied he had committed adultery, the suggestion of impropriety was damaging.|$|E
5|$|Pilcher's {{marriage}} {{was not a}} happy one; a gambler and womaniser, he expected his independently wealthy wife to bail out his debts and {{turn a blind eye}} to his mistresses. The two gradually drifted into separate lives, and after finally confronted with an affair becoming public, Kathleen sued for divorce. The precipitating event was Pilcher having been named as <b>co-respondent</b> in a divorce suit; it was alleged that he had committed adultery with Millicent Knight-Bruce, the wife of Major James Knight-Bruce. The case dragged on through 1910, delayed by Pilcher's inability to return from India to attend the court. Pilcher did not contest his wife's suit, and his own divorce was granted in 1911; he married Millicent, now divorced, in 1913.|$|E
5|$|Lawton married Rosaleen May Kavanagh in January 1941; the {{marriage}} bore one child, Amanda. Rosaleen never watched Lawton play football during their ten-year marriage. Divorce was granted with a decree nisi in March 1951 after Rosaleen {{was found to}} have committed adultery with Notts County director Adrian Van Geffen; Lawton never saw Amanda again and was not required to pay child support. He would not hear from his daughter until she was convicted of stealing from playwright George Axelrod in 1968, by which time Rosaleen was on her fourth marriage and living in Jamaica. Lawton married second wife Gladys Rose in September 1952, who bore him a son, Thomas Junior. Gladys was also divorced, and her ex-husband cited Lawton as a <b>co-respondent</b> in the divorce proceedings as the pair had begun their relationship whilst Gladys was still married; her family were staunch Catholics, and Gladys was ostracised by her family following her divorce. Gladys had a daughter, Carol, from her previous marriage, who Lawton raised as his own. Thomas Junior went on to play rugby union for Leicester Tigers.|$|E

25|$|In July 1879, Langtry {{began an}} affair with the Earl of Shrewsbury; in January 1880, Langtry and the earl were {{planning}} to run away together. In the autumn of 1879, rumours were published in Town Talk that her husband would divorce her and cite, among others, the Prince of Wales as <b>co-respondent.</b> Adolphus Rosenberg was the journalist. He wrote separately about Mrs Cornwallis-West, which resulted in her husband suing him for libel. At this point, the Prince of Wales instructed his solicitor George Lewis to sue. Rosenburg pleaded guilty to both of the charges brought against him {{and was sentenced to}} 2 years in prison.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{his return}} to the United States, the Arbeelys, a Greek Orthodox family of Damascene origins, had begun {{printing}} Kawkab America (American Star), the first Arabic-language newspaper in North America; Mokarzel set out to open his own newspaper Al-ʿAsr (The Epoch) with capital from his wealthy merchant friend, Najeeb Maalouf. Mokarzel and Nageeb Arbeely engaged in a journalistic feud, personally attacking each other resulting in series of lawsuits and counter-suits between the two newspapers. The enterprise floundered and was discontinued {{less than a year after}} its commencement. Mokarzel attended medical school for two years before dropping out. Meanwhile, Mokarzel was gaining notoriety for his controversial demeanor; he engaged in brawls and verbal disputes with other Arabic-speaking immigrants and was arrested on several occasions for libel and physical assault against members of the community affiliated with the Arbeely family. The brawls that started as a result of professional competition and personal antipathy evolved into sectarian battles between Mokarzel's Maronite entourage and the Orthodox families of the community. Despite his multiple arrests, Mokarzel was never jailed but the incidents were to continue. In 1895, Tannous Shishim, a Lebanese immigrant, petitioned for divorce from his wife Sophie on the ground of adultery and Mokarzel was named <b>co-respondent</b> in the court proceedings. The Arbeelys were quick to publish the culpable news in their newspaper along with a bilingual transcript of the judge's decision, further tarnishing the reputation of Mokarzel. The accused couple got married and eloped to Philadelphia to flea the community's public denunciation.|$|E

She appeared in secondary roles in two more films, but by 1923 her film career was over {{at the age of}} twenty-eight. Her life became a series of constant ups and downs fighting her addictions. Hansen was named as one of two <b>co-respondents</b> in a divorce suit brought by Evelyn Nesbit against Jack Clifford. Clifford left Nesbit in 1918 and she divorced him in 1933.|$|R

50|$|In {{the initial}} divorce case Russell v. Russell in 1922, the two named <b>co-respondents</b> were acquitted while {{the case for}} the unnamed partner was inconclusive. In the second divorce case in 1923, Christabel was convicted of {{adultery}} and lost on appeal, but had the verdict overturned on further appeal to the House of Lords which ruled in 1924 that no child born after a marriage could be declared illegitimate merely on the testimony of his mother or father. The scandal led to the enactment of the Judicial Proceedings (Regulation of Reports) Act 1926 to prevent detailed evidence in divorce cases appearing in newspapers.|$|R
500|$|Beecham {{was married}} three times. In 1903 he married Utica Celestina Welles, {{daughter}} of Dr Charles S. Welles, of New York, {{and his wife}} Ella Celeste, née Miles. Beecham {{and his wife had}} two sons: Adrian, born in 1904, who became a composer and achieved some celebrity in the 1920s and 1930s, and Thomas, born in 1909. [...] After the birth of his second child, Beecham began to drift away from the marriage. By 1911, no longer living with his wife and family, he was involved as <b>co-respondent</b> in a much-publicised divorce case. Utica ignored advice that she should divorce him and secure substantial alimony; she did not believe in divorce. [...] She never remarried after Beecham divorced her (in 1943), and she outlived her former husband by sixteen years, dying in 1977.|$|E
500|$|In April 1869 Sir Charles Mordaunt (1836–1897) learnt {{that his}} wife had had three {{separate}} affairs, and that her lovers included the heir to the throne. Although Mordaunt did not carry out his threat of citing the prince as <b>co-respondent</b> in the subsequent divorce case, Edward was subpoenaed to appear in court as a witness. Although Edward did not want to appear—and the queen wrote to the Lord Chancellor to see if this could be avoided—the law was such that the heir to the throne could be forced to appear if necessary. The prince appeared voluntarily and was in the witness box for seven minutes, during which time he denied having had a sexual relationship with Mordaunt's wife; he was not cross-examined. Edward's biographer, Colin Matthew, wrote that [...] "the hearing coincided with general criticism of the very different deportments of both the queen and the prince. The latter was several times booed in public". Despite the [...] "taboo on open criticism on [...] actions, an undercurrent of dissatisfaction existed" [...] with him and his actions. For Edward, although such affairs could be discussed between friends, scandal was to be avoided wherever possible.|$|E
500|$|Gladstone {{resigned}} as Prime Minister in 1885 following a Government defeat over the Irish home rule question. The new Tory government {{was led by}} Lord Salisbury. However, as a minority administration it was not expected to last, and a swift return of the former administration was anticipated. During this period serious (if unproven) charges of plotting and ruthless ambition {{were about to be}} levelled against Lady Rosebery. Sir Charles Dilke, considered as a likely replacement for Gladstone, and thus a rival to Rosebery in government, was implicated {{in one of the most}} scandalous and ruinous divorce cases of the era. Involvement in any divorce was social suicide in the 19th century, but the facts which emerged were enough to ensure it was political suicide as well. A friend of the Roseberys, Donald Crawford, MP, sued his wife Virginia for divorce naming Dilke as <b>co-respondent.</b> There was little evidence and Dilke denied the charge, which could have been ultimately forgotten, if Virginia had not suddenly decided to sign a confession giving such lurid details that a great scandal was unavoidable. She claimed that not only had Dilke slept with her and taught her [...] "French vices", but also slept with her mother and partaken in a three-in-a-bed orgy with Virginia and a maid. Dilke denied everything, but his hopes of high political office were ruined forever. Dilke claimed the whole thing was an embroidery of lies and conspiracies by his political enemies. Rumours began to circulate that the Roseberys, and Lady Rosebery in particular, were at the bottom of Dilke's misfortune. In his futile quest to exonerate himself, and grasping at rumour, Dilke wrote to Rosebery accusing Lady Rosebery of having paid Virginia to make the confession. An outraged Rosebery denied all on his wife's behalf, while in December 1885 Lady Rosebery's only response on being told of Virginia Crawford's confessions was: [...] "Dilke's behaviour is very astonishing in some reports, though it is not an actual surprise to me." [...] Early the following year Gladstone was returned to power and Rosebery was appointed Foreign Secretary in Gladstone's third but brief term of office. Dilke's political career was ruined, and for years afterwards he continued to expound the Rosebery conspiracy theory. Nothing was ever proven against Lady Rosebery and no tangible evidence exists to substantiate the claim.|$|E
50|$|The duke {{was cited}} {{as one of}} four <b>co-respondents</b> in the sensational divorce trial of Lady Colin Campbell. He married, as his second wife, (Jane) Lilian Warren Price (1854-1909), the widow of Louis Carré Hammersley, a New York {{real-estate}} millionaire, and a daughter of retired United States Navy Commodore Cicero Price. The civil marriage took place on 29 June 1888 at New York City Hall, with the ceremony officiated by the Mayor of New York City, Abram S. Hewitt. A religious ceremony followed the same day, in the chancel of Tabernacle Baptist Church and presided over by its minister, Dr. Daniel C. Potter. There were no issue from this marriage.|$|R
50|$|In 1930, F.W. Thring (1883-1936) {{established}} the Efftee Studios based in Melbourne to make talking films using optical sound equipment {{imported from the}} USA. The first sound films produced were in 1931, when the company produced Diggers (1931), A <b>Co-respondent's</b> Course (1931), The Haunted Barn (1931) and The Sentimental Bloke (1932). During the five years of its existence, Efftee produced nine features, over 80 shorts and several stage productions. Notable collaborators included C. J. Dennis, George Wallace and Frank Harvey. Film production continued only until 1934, when it ceased as a protest over the refusal of the Australian government to set Australian film quotas, followed soon by Thring's death. It was estimated Thring lost over ₤75,000 {{of his own money}} on his filmmaking and theatrical ventures.|$|R
5000|$|John Russell, {{the heir}} to Oliver Russell, 2nd Baron Ampthill, married Christabel Hart in 1918. In 1921 Christabel {{discovered}} she was about five months pregnant. The couple had not fully consummated their marriage, though they had slept {{in the same bed}} in Oakley House for a night the preceding December. John sued for divorce on grounds of adultery, naming two <b>co-respondents</b> and one unknown. Christabel claimed she was a virgin and produced medical expert evidence that prior to the birth of Geoffrey in October 1921 she had an only partly perforated hymen. She also claimed that her husband had undertaken [...] "Hunnish (that is to say Barbaric) scenes" [...] and had attempted to rape her on the night in question, and that she had used a sponge he had previously used.|$|R

50|$|Lord Enniskillen married Charlotte Marion Baird, {{daughter}} of wealthy Scottish businessman Douglas Baird {{and his wife}} Charlotte Acton, in 1869. The following year he was cited as one of two <b>co-respondents</b> in the case for divorce brought by Sir Charles Mordaunt, 10th Bt., a former M.P., against his wife, Harriet, in which Prince Albert Edward, The Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), was called to give evidence. The divorce was denied as Lady Mordaunt was judged to be insane, but was finally granted in 1875 when Cole did not contest the claim {{that he was the}} father of Lady Mordaunt's daughter, Violet (1869-1928), later Marchioness of Bath. Lord Enniskillen died in April 1924, aged 78, and was succeeded in his titles by his second — but eldest surviving — son John. Lady Enniskillen died in 1937.|$|R
40|$|This interpretative phenomenological enquiry {{into the}} {{experience}} of being bullied in the workplace identifies five themes connected to bullying: The Impossible Pendulum, Echoes of Past Bullying, Reframing and Re-blaming of Self, Finding My-”Self” Again and Reframing the Future. Workplace bullying is recognised as a global phenomenon. However, research estimates {{that the vast majority of}} incidents go unreported. One UK study found 50 % of respondents had been bullied at work or had witnessed others being bullied. Most research focuses on the incidence and typologies of bullying or the impact of bullying on business. Far fewer studies have been conducted qualitatively and even less explored {{the experience of}} being bullied at work. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 10 <b>co-respondents</b> who had been bullied at work. The interviews were then analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The five interpretative themes were discussed with special reference to Nietzsche’s “master” and “slave” concept, Heidegger’s idea of “unavailableness” and the pivotal role that our experience of the “Other” and our “Other-ness” plays. This research shows that the “lived experience” of workplace bullying can have far-reaching, negative and ongoing effects in an individual’s “life-world”. The findings are also discussed in light of the theoretical and methodological concerns that surround IPA studies. An outline for workplace anti-bullying training is discussed and the contribution this study makes to Counselling Psychology is explored. Implications for future research arising from this study and others are also suggested and discussed...|$|R
25|$|Huxley's main <b>co-respondents</b> in {{the modern}} {{evolutionary}} synthesis are usually listed as Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, George Gaylord Simpson, Bernhard Rensch, Ledyard Stebbins and the population geneticists J. B. S. Haldane, Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright. However, {{at the time of}} Huxley's book several of these had yet to make their distinctive contribution. Certainly, for Huxley, E. B. Ford and his co-workers in ecological genetics were at least as important; and Cyril Darlington, the chromosome expert, was a notable source of facts and ideas.An analysis of the 'authorities cited' index of Evolution the modern synthesis shows indirectly those whom Huxley regarded as the most important contributors to the synthesis up to 1941 (the book was published in 1942, and references go up to 1941). The authorities cited 20 or more times are:Darlington, Darwin, Dobzhansky, Fisher, Ford, Goldschmidt, Haldane, J. S. Huxley, Muller, Rensch, Turrill, Wright.This list contains a few surprises. Goldschmidt was an influential geneticist who advocated evolution by saltation, and was sometimes mentioned in disagreement. Turrill provided Huxley with botanical information. The list omits three key members of the synthesis who are listed above: Mayr, Stebbins the botanist and Simpson the palaeontologist. Mayr gets 16 citations and more in the two later editions; all three published outstanding and relevant books some years later, and their contribution to the synthesis is unquestionable. Their lesser weight in Huxley's citations was caused by the early publication date of his book. Huxley's book is not strong in palaeontology, which illustrates perfectly why Simpson's later works were such an important contribution.|$|R
