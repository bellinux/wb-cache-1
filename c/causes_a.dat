5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The animal's sense organ is altered when it detects an object. This <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> perceptual {{change in the}} animal's seat of sensation, which Aristotle {{believed}} was the heart, not as we now think the brain. This in turn <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> change in the heart's heat, which <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> quantitative change sufficient to make the heart transmit a mechanical impulse to a limb, which moves, moving the animal's body. The alteration {{in the heat of}} the heart also <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> change in the consistency of the joints, which helps the limb to move.|$|E
5|$|All welding of {{titanium}} {{must be done}} in an {{inert atmosphere}} of argon or helium to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen). Contamination <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> variety of conditions, such as embrittlement, which reduces {{the integrity of the}} assembly welds and leads to joint failure.|$|E
50|$|Impaired venous outflow {{is often}} <b>caused</b> by <b>a</b> hypoplastic jugular foramen. This <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> {{increase}} in the intracranial blood volume, thereby <b>causing</b> <b>an</b> increase in intracranial pressure.|$|R

25|$|The {{highest degree}} of evil deed will <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> soul {{to be born}} into a realm as a denizen of hell, the lower degree of that would <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> soul to be born as an animal, and the lowest degree would <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> soul to be born as a hungry ghost.|$|R
5|$|Another rare {{complication}} {{that may}} occur early during warfarin treatment (usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement) is purple toe syndrome. This condition is thought to result from small deposits of cholesterol breaking loose and causing embolisms in {{blood vessels in the}} skin of the feet, which <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> blueish purple colour and may be painful.|$|E
5|$|Compression of {{ambient air}} <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> {{temperature}} {{rise of the}} gas, proportional to the pressure increase. Ambient air is typically compressed in stages, and the gas temperature rises during each stage. Intercoolers and water cooling heat exchangers can remove this heat between stages.|$|E
5|$|Electron beam {{processing}} is used {{to irradiate}} materials in order to change their physical properties or sterilize medical and food products. Electron beams fluidise or quasi-melt glasses without significant increase of temperature on intensive irradiation: e.g. intensive electron radiation <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> many orders of magnitude decrease of viscosity and stepwise decrease of its activation energy.|$|E
50|$|The sting can <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> severe burning {{sensation}} and swelling in humans; in rare cases, it can <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> life-threatening reaction (such as anaphylaxis).|$|R
50|$|The {{failure of}} one or more {{reaction}} wheels can <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> spacecraft to lose its ability to maintain position and thus potentially <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> mission failure.|$|R
40|$|Rats {{and mice}} were given {{antibiotics}} orally and by subcutaneous injection {{and the effects}} on tissue levels of 5 -hydroxytryptamine and intestinal bacteria were studied. In mice {{it was found that}} antibiotics which <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> large reduction in the bacterial flora of the intestine when given orally also <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> significant increase in intestinal 5 -hydroxytryptamine. In rats, neomycin <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> reduction in the urinary excretion of 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid. In both rats and mice, many antibiotics <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> significant reduction in the weight of the spleen...|$|R
5|$|In some enzymes, no {{amino acids}} are {{directly}} involved in catalysis; instead, the enzyme contains sites to bind and orient catalytic cofactors. Enzyme structures may also contain allosteric sites where the binding of a small molecule <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> conformational change that increases or decreases activity.|$|E
5|$|July 13, 1996– Hurricane Bertha {{crosses the}} entire state as a {{tropical}} storm, causing heavy rainfall peaking at 6.59inches (16.74cm) in Estell Manor. Bertha also <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> storm surge of 2.27feet (69cm) in Atlantic City, while rough waves kill one surfer.|$|E
5|$|June 13, 1966– Hurricane Alma {{approaches}} the coast before turning northeastward and becoming extratropical. The storm <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> high tide of 4.5feet (1.4m) in Atlantic City.|$|E

50|$|If an {{aircraft}} in flight suffers a disturbance in pitch that <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> increase (or decrease) in angle of attack, {{it is desirable}} that the aerodynamic forces on the aircraft <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> decrease (or increase) in angle of attack so that the disturbance does not <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> continuous increase (or decrease) in angle of attack. This is longitudinal static stability.|$|R
5|$|On 16 June 2011, <b>a</b> welding {{accident}} <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> fire at Hallingskeid Station, {{causing the}} complete {{destruction of the}} platform. This <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> seven days long closure of the line.|$|R
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} inhibits excretion of {{the waste}} product urate and <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> predisposition for gout, in which urate builds up. This condition is known as saturnine gout.|$|E
5|$|November 1, 1985– Tropical Storm Juan becomes extratropical over Tennessee and {{produces}} heavy rainfall in western North Carolina; the precipitation <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> mudslide that blocked {{a portion of}} Interstate 40 near Marion.|$|E
5|$|Pseudomembranous colitis is a {{potentially}} lethal condition {{commonly associated with}} clindamycin, but which occurs with other antibiotics, as well. Overgrowth of Clostridium difficile, which is inherently resistant to clindamycin, results {{in the production of}} a toxin that <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> range of adverse effects, from diarrhea to colitis and toxic megacolon.|$|E
50|$|Nasalization may <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> vowel's {{articulation}} to shift. However, nasalization {{from the}} assimilation of a nasal consonant tends to <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> raising of vowel height; phonemically distinctive nasalization tends to lower the vowel.|$|R
50|$|Simultanagnosia can {{be divided}} into two {{different}} categories: dorsal and ventral. Ventral occipito-temporal lesions <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> mild form of the disorder, while dorsal occipito-parietal lesions <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> more severe form of the disorder.|$|R

5|$|Python 2.2 changes integer {{division}} to round towards negative infinity, e.g. 7/3 == 2 and -7/3 == -3. The floor division // operator is introduced. So 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 == 2.0 and -7.5//3 == -3.0. Adding from __future__ import division <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> module to use Python 3.0 rules for division (see next).|$|E
5|$|September 3, 1821 — The 1821 Norfolk and Long Island {{hurricane}} {{results in}} severe damage on Long Island and {{is accompanied by}} storm surge of 13 feet (4 m). High wind <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> ship to crash on Long Island killing 17 people.|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} {{relating the}} two radial forces {{can be understood}} qualitatively as follows. The difference in angular speeds (or equivalently, in angular momenta) <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> difference in the centripetal force requirement; to offset this, the radial force must be altered with an inverse-cube force.|$|E

25|$|Flashback is the {{condition}} of the flame propagating down the hoses of an oxy-fuel welding and cutting system. To prevent such a situation a flashback arrestor is usually employed. The flame burns backwards into the hose, <b>causing</b> <b>a</b> popping or squealing noise. It can <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> explosion in the hose with the potential to injure or kill the operator. Using a lower pressure than recommended can <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> flashback.|$|R
50|$|Many {{infusion}} {{pumps are}} controlled by a small embedded system. They are carefully designed so that no single cause of failure can harm the patient. For example, most have batteries in case the wall-socket power fails. Additional hazards are uncontrolled flow <b>causing</b> <b>an</b> overdose, uncontrolled lack of flow, <b>causing</b> <b>an</b> underdose, reverse flow, which can siphon blood from a patient, and air in the line, which can <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> air embolism.|$|R
5|$|This sort of {{licensing}} is {{very important}} for maintaining safe production and sales of alcoholic beverages in Oregon. Under Oregon law, specifically ORS 471.565, bars and restaurants can be held legally responsible for any damages to property or injuries incurred when an intoxicated person is served alcohol and <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> car crash.|$|E
5|$|Uncompetitive {{inhibition}} {{occurs when}} the inhibitor binds only to the enzyme–substrate complex, not to the free enzyme; the EIS complex is catalytically inactive. This mode of inhibition is rare and <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> decrease in both Vmax and the Km value.|$|E
5|$|Unlike diethyl ether, {{methoxyflurane}} is {{a significant}} respiratory depressant. In dogs, methoxyflurane <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> dose-dependent decrease in respiratory rate and a marked decrease in respiratory minute volume, with a relatively mild decrease in tidal volume. In humans, methoxyflurane <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> dose-dependent decrease in tidal volume and minute volume, with respiratory rate relatively constant. The net effect of these changes is profound respiratory depression, as evidenced by CO2 retention with a concomitant decrease in arterial pH (this {{is referred to as}} a respiratory acidosis) when anesthetized subjects are allowed to breathe spontaneously for any length of time.|$|E
50|$|An agonist is a {{chemical}} that binds to a receptor and activates the receptor {{to produce a}} biological response. Whereas <b>an</b> agonist <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> action, an antagonist blocks {{the action of the}} agonist and <b>an</b> inverse agonist <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> action opposite to that of the agonist.|$|R
30|$|Fe@Au <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> {{shock to}} the {{mitochondria}} within 4  h, but the cancer cells could not recover from {{the damage caused by}} them. Further, it <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> sequential autophagy and inhibited the cancer cell growth.|$|R
50|$|During the burn, a new {{aerodynamic}} fairing installed {{around the}} rocket nozzle overheated, became too soft, and crumpled inwards. This <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> loud bang, which the pilot reported, {{but did not}} <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> flight problem.|$|R
