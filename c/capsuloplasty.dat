A clinical and radiographic evaluation {{was conducted by}} Dutoit et al. and Severin et al. criteria, respectively. Resultsthe acetabular preoperative index for the 13 surgically treated hips ranged from 27 ° to 50 ° (average of 36), and after surgical correction to 18. 5 ° (10 – 28 °), so that the evaluations of preoperative and postoperative acetabular indexes showed up significant statistic reduction (p 0. 05). As complications occurred, {{it was found that}} three subluxations and a subluxation associated with avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Conclusionopen reduction, Salter et al. ’s osteotomy and <b>capsuloplasty</b> are seen to be a viable option for the treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip, according to clinical and radiological medium‐term evaluations...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTObjectives: To {{show the}} {{preoperative}} planning and results from surgical treatment for paralytic hip dislocation among patients with cerebral palsy. The techniques used were proximal femoral varus derotation osteotomy {{in association with}} Dega iliac osteotomy, without opening the joint capsule. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of ten hips in eight patients with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy who underwent surgical treatment between 2003 and 2005, with the same surgical technique. The pre and postoperative clinical and radiological parameters, and the preoperative planning using an image intensifier, were assessed. The clinical parameters analyzed were: pain, hygiene-related difficulties and positioning difficulties. The radiological parameters were Reimer's index, the acetabular index and the neck-shaft angle. These results were subjected to statistical analysis. Results: We obtained good results with this technique. After a mean follow-up of three years, all the hips were observed to be stable at the last assessment, {{and there was a}} high degree of satisfaction among the families in relation to the treatment. We also showed that preoperative planning using an image intensifier allowed us to reduce and stabilize these hips without the need for <b>capsuloplasty.</b> Conclusion: The authors conclude that in treating hip dislocation among spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy patients, <b>capsuloplasty</b> is unnecessary for stabilizing the coxofemoral joint...|$|E

40|$|Background and objective: In the {{perivascular}} sheath of the brachial plexus, {{the volume}} of anaesthetic solution determines the quality of anaesthetic cover. Fibrous septa may divide the perivascular space into compartments, leading to inadequate diffusion of the anaesthetic solution. The aim of our study was to obtain good anaesthesia and less complications using high volume of low concentration anaesthetic solution, overcoming the obstacle of the septa with a double approach to the scalene sheath. Methods: Sixty patients scheduled for shoulder <b>capsuloplasty</b> received both Winnie interscalene brachial plexus block and Pippa proximal cranial needle approach. The patients {{were randomly assigned to}} two groups. A constant dose of local anaesthetic was administered to each group: Group I (30 patients) received high volume (60 mL of anaesthetic solution) and Group II (30 patients) received low volume of solution (30 mL of anaesthetic solution). Sensory and motor block in the upper limb and complications were evaluated. Results: In all the patients the quality of anaesthesia obtained at the surgical site was excellent. In Group I also the areas supplied by the medial cutaneous nerves of the arm and forearm, ulnar, median and radial nerves were blocked (P < 0. 002). Complications were only observed in Group II and consisted of bradycardia and hypotension (66 % of the patients) and phrenic nerve paresis (27 %, of the patients). Conclusions: The lower concentration of the anaesthetic solution avoids complications while increased volume provides good analgesic cover. The combination of the Winnie interscalene plexus block and the Pippa proximal cranial needle approach should contribute to fill up the scalene sheath overcoming the septa obstacles...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: To {{assess the}} result of the {{treatment}} of moderate to severe hallux valgus with osteotomy of the first metatarsal base associated to distal release of soft parts and medial <b>capsuloplasty.</b> Methods: 13 patients were assessed (15 feet) submitted to surgical treatment of hallux valgus moderate to severe. The mean follow-up time was 102 months; there were 12 female and 1 male patients, with mean age at the time of surgery of 49 years. The patients enrolled were interviewed according to the questionnaire developed by our service, clinically examined according to the AOFAS scale and submitted to X-ray tests for comparing the results with baseline images. Results: The mean score of the AOFAS scale obtained at the final assessment was 82 points. Nine of the 15 feet (60 %) showed some late complications, with four (27 %) varus deformities, three (20 %) recurrences; two patients (13 %) presenting with pain complaints with no associated deformity. In the hallux metatarsophalangeal joint, movement loss was 41 ° (57 %); dorsiflexion movement was mostly affected, with a mean loss of 37 ° (60 %). The range of motion on the contralateral intact side served as control group. Arthrosis progression was seen on the final X-ray evaluation. In all cases, shortening and lifting of the first metatarsal were noticed; however, we couldn't correlate the shortening and lifting with metatarsalgia, plant callosity or lower scoring on the AOFAS scale at the final evaluation. Conclusions: The osteotomy technique by the basis and with distal realignment of soft parts employed in the treatment of moderate to severe hallux valgus showed a high rate of late complications. Due to the high number of complications, we believe that adopting this technique for correcting hallux valgus deformities should be carefully considered...|$|E
40|$|Wrist {{ligament}} {{injuries are}} common after trauma, especially when concomitant dislocated radius fractures are present. The diagnostics of scapholunate (SL), lunotriquetral (LT) and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injuries are challenging and most often dependent on {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) examination or invasive arthroscopy. In some circumstances, missed ligament injuries can lead to devastating sequelae, in terms of pain, reduced grip strength, range of motion and subsequent degenerative arthritis. In certain cases and under certain conditions, the choice of treatment for wrist ligament injuries can sometimes {{be the subject of}} debate. An updated review of diagnostic accuracy, a higher awareness of the injuries among orthopaedic surgeons, a surgically adaptable classification of the injuries and objective and clinically easily adapted diagnostic tools are essential. This thesis demonstrates that a negative result from MRI cannot rule out the possibility of a clinically relevant injury to the SL ligament, the LT ligament or the TFCC. Clinical provocation wrist tests are of limited diagnostic value. The current gold standard, wrist arthroscopy, remains the preferred diagnostic technique with sufficient conclusive properties when it comes to wrist ligament injuries. Due to low accuracy and high costs, MRI can most often be abandoned, when it comes to wrist ligament injuries. The cost of wrist MRI is three times higher than that of a clinical examination at the Hand Surgery Department, Sahlgrenska University Hospital. The thesis emphasises the increased diligence required when dealing with wrist trauma in children and adolescents, as a substantial amount of delayed presentation of distal radio-ulnar joint (DRUJ) instability after wrist fractures or sprains in children and adolescents is found. The most striking finding is that several children and adolescents present with DRUJ instability with isolated TFCC tears. The long delay from injury to diagnosis and the severity of the injury in terms of solving the DRUJ instability problem among young people is also interesting and somewhat surprising. Four distinct SL injury types can be identified and classified. This classification can be used in both open and arthroscopic surgery and in acute, subacute and chronic injuries. An arthroscopically assisted SL <b>capsuloplasty</b> and suture may not be possible in all patients, particularly not when the ligament has been completely avulsed from the bone (in approximately 60 % of patients; Andersson-Garcia-Elias Type 1 and 2), leaving no ligament remnant on one side. Most patients with an SL injury will require ligament re-attachment techniques using transosseous sutures, bone anchors, or ligament reconstruction. Distal radio-ulnar joint instability with an arthroscopically confirmed TFCC injury is associated with a 30 % loss of pre-operative peak torque strength in pronation and supination – a measurement technique easily adapted in the clinical pre-operative setting...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIntroductionDistal radius {{fractures}} represent 20 % of {{fractures in}} adults. Although good results are usually obtained with treatment, functional sequelae are not uncommon, with injury of the distal radio-ulnar joint (DRUJ) {{being the most}} frequent. Various treatments have been described to address these disorders. Distal ulna resection-stabilisation (DURS) is our technique of choice when preservation of the DRUJ is impossible. Patients and methodTwenty patients operated between 1985 and 1996 were reviewed with minimum 6 -year follow-up. Nine of them were men and 11 were women, {{with an average age}} 45 years. The initial trauma was a distal radius fracture in all cases. The main complaint was ulnar pain with no limitation of mobility in five patients, painful limitation of prono-supination in 14, and palmar subluxation of the ulna in one case. Radiographic evaluation and CT scan showed DRUJ incongruence in 14 patients with ulna head instability, and ulno-carpal abutment with degenerative changes at the DRUJ in six cases. In three patients, malunion of the distal radius was associated with degenerative DRUJ lesions. ResultsThe satisfaction rate was 95 % at an average follow-up of 11 years (range 6. 7 to 18. 6 years). Pain scores decreased progressively from 2. 2 to 0. 5 post-operatively. Range of motion improved in supination from 37 ° to 80 °, and in pronation from 66 ° to 84 °. Improvements were 15 ° in ulnar inclination, 9 ° in radial inclination, 16 ° in flexion, and 23 ° in extension. Distal ulna palpation was not painful, and no instability was observed on movement. Wrist strength was equivalent to 80. 8 % of the healthy contra-lateral side. Radiographic results showed no anomaly of the resected ulna, no sign of abutment on the radius and no ulnar translation of the carpus at follow-up. Only one patient, who presented algoneurodystrophic syndrome after the initial trauma, had a recurrence after DURS. Discussion-ConclusionDRUJ injuries are frequent in the context of wrist trauma. If not well-treated, they could lead to significant functional sequelae of the wrist. Radiographic evaluation should clarify the status of the DRUJ to choose between conservative or radical surgical treatment. If the DRUJ surfaces are preserved, conservative treatment, which consists of correcting the distal radius malunion and stabilising or shortening the ulna, is the treatment of choice. When the DRUJ surfaces are injured, DURS is our treatment of choice. This approach presents a low complication rate and more than 90 % of satisfactory results, often with a pain-free wrist, functional range of motion and good strength. However, a rigorous technique, with limited ulna head resection, dorsal <b>capsuloplasty,</b> reconstruction of the extensor retinaculum and dorsal placement of the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon, is a prerequisite for success.
