40|$|<b>Cucumber</b> green mottle <b>mosaic</b> virus (CGMMV) is {{a member}} of the genus Tobamovirus, and is a serious {{pathogen}} of Cucurbitaceae crops. Virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs), which are processed by Dicer-like and Argonaute proteins as well as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, mediate the silencing of viral genomic RNA and host transcripts. To identify the CGMMV derived vsiRNAs and reveal interactions between CGMMV and watermelon host plant, deep sequencing technology was used to identify and characterize the vsiRNAs derived from CGMMV in infected watermelon plants in present study. A total of 10 801 368 vsiRNA reads representing 71 583 unique sRNAs were predicted in CGMMV-inoculated watermelon plants. The CGMMV vsiRNAs were mostly 21 or 22 nt long. The majority of the CGMMV vsiRNAs (i. e., 91. 7 %) originated from the viral sense strand. Additionally, uracil was the predominant 5 ′-terminal base of vsiRNAs. Furthermore, the putative targets and functions of some of the CGMMV vsiRNAs were predicted and investigated.

40|$|The {{infectious}} full-length cDNA clones of <b>Cucumber</b> green mottle <b>mosaic</b> virus (CGMMV) isolates KW and KOM, {{which were}} isolated from watermelon and oriental melon, respectively, were constructed {{under the control}} of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter. We successfully inoculated Nicotiana benthamiana with the cloned CGMMV isolates KW and KOM by Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration. Virulence and symptomatic characteristics of the cloned CGMMV isolates KW and KOM were tested on several indicator plants. No obvious differences between two cloned isolates in disease development were observed on the tested indicator plants. We also determined full genome sequences of the cloned CGMMV isolates KW and KOM. Sequence comparison revealed that only four amino acids (at positions 228, 699, 1212, and 1238 of the replicase protein region) differ between the cloned isolates KW and KOM. A previous study reported that the isolate KOM could not infect Chenopodium amaranticolor, but the cloned KOM induced chlorotic spots on the inoculated leaves. When compared with the previously reported sequence of the original KOM isolate, the cloned KOM contained one amino acid mutation (Ala to Thr) at position 228 of the replicase protein, suggesting that this mutation might be responsible for induction of chlorotic spots on the inoculated leaves of C. amaranticolor...|$|R

40|$|Greenhouse {{vegetable}} {{production is}} a very important and successful agricultural sector in Ontario. However, newly emerging viral or virus-like diseases have become a major limiting factor in greenhouse vegetable production. To determine the identity of the viral pathogens in the three major greenhouse vegetables in Ontario, we conducted in-depth sequencing of small RNAs isolated from virally infected plants used next-generation sequencing technology. Subsequent bioinformatics analyses revealed six viral pathogens including Bell pepper endornavirus (BPEV), Parietaria mottle virus (PMoV), <b>Cucumber</b> green mottle <b>mosaic</b> virus (CGMMV), Tobacco streak virus (TSV), Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), and Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV). The full-length genome sequences of BPEV, PMoV, and CGMMV have been cloned and sequenced. Since CGMMV causes the most severe economic lossess, we further characterized CGMMV and constructed an infectious CGMMV clone for the development of an attnuated virus for the control of CGMMV. We found that in the mimic greenhouse hydroponic production system, CGMMV is water-transmissible. We introduced various mutaitons into the CGMMV infectious clones and tested their infectivity. Our data demonstrated that when host plants were infected by two particular mutants MRTAL and MGVDT, no symptom appeared on the systemic leaves and viral RNA or coat protein accumulation level was low. Based on these data, we suggest that the mutants MRTAL and MGVDT have great potential to be used as attenuated CGMMV variants for cross protection against CGMMV...|$|R
40|$|Systemic {{movement}} of <b>Cucumber</b> green mottle <b>mosaic</b> virus (CGMMV) in cucumber plants {{was shown to}} be from photoassimilate source to sink, thus indicating phloem transport. Nevertheless, CGMMV was not detected by immunocytochemical procedures in the intermediary cell–sieve element complex in inoculated cotyledons, where photoassimilate loading occurs. In stem internodes, CGMMV was first localized in the companion cells of the external phloem and subsequently in all tissues except the medulla, therefore suggesting leakage of the virus from, and reloading into, the transport phloem during systemic movement. In systemically infected sink leaves, CGMMV was simultaneously detected in the xylem and phloem. Interestingly, CGMMV accumulated to high levels in the differentiating tracheids of young leaves implying that the xylem could {{be involved in the}} systemic {{movement of}} CGMMV. This possibility was tested using plants in which cell death was induced in a portion of the stem by steam treatment. At 24 6 C, steam treatment effectively prevented the systemic movement of CGMMV, even though viral RNA was detected in washes of the xylem above the steamed internode suggesting that xylem circulation occurred. At 29 6 C, CGMMV systemically infected steam-treated cucumber plants, indicating that CGMMV can move systemically via the xylem. Xylem transport of CGMMV was, however, less efficient than phloem transport in terms of the time required for systemic infection and the percentage of plants infected...|$|R
40|$|A <b>Cucumber</b> green mottle <b>mosaic</b> virus (CGMMV) {{was used}} to present a {{truncated}} dengue virus type 2 envelope (E) protein binding region from amino acids 379 to 423 (EB 4). The EB 4 gene was inserted at the terminal end of the CGMMV coat protein (CP) open reading frame (ORF). Read-through sequences of TMV or CGMMV, CAA-UAG-CAA-UUA, or AAA-UAG-CAA-UUA were, respectively, inserted in between the CP and the EB 4 genes. The chimeric clones, pRT, pRG, and pCG+FSRTRE, were transcribed into full-length capped recombinant CGMMV transcripts. Only constructs with the wild-type CGMMV read-through sequence yielded infectious viruses following infection of host plant, muskmelon (Cucumis melo) leaves. The ratio of modified to unmodified CP for the read-through expression clone developed was also found to be approximately 1 : 1, higher than what has been previously reported. It was also observed that infectivity was not affected by differences in pI between the chimera and its wild counterpart. Analysis of recombinant viruses after 21 -days-postinculation (dpi) revealed that deletions occurred resulting in partial reversions of the viral population to near wild type and suggesting {{that this would be}} the limiting harvest period for obtaining true to type recombinants with this construct.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Cucumber</b> green mottle <b>mosaic</b> virus (CGMMV), {{a member}} of the genus Tobamovirus, can be {{transmitted}} by seeds and infects many cucurbit species, causing serious yield losses in cucumber and watermelon plants. In this paper, five serological methods including antigen-coated plate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ACP-ELISA), triple antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (TAS-ELISA), Dot-immunobinding assay (DBIA), direct tissue blot immunoassay (DTBIA) and immunocapture reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (IC-RT-PCR) were described for detection and diagnosis of CGMMV. Results Using the purified CGMMV particles as immunogens, six murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were produced. Five serological methods were established using the MAb 4 H 1 and detection sensitivity was compared using purified preparations and infected-plant tissue extracts. The detection sensitivity of ACP-ELISA was 0. 16 ng of purified CGMMV, whereas TAS-ELISA was more sensitive than ACP-ELISA with a minimum detection of 0. 04 ng of purified CGMMV. The sensitivities of TAS-ELISA and DBIA were similar for detecting CGMMV in infected-plant tissue extracts, and were four times higher than ACP-ELISA. The IC-RT-PCR was the most sensitive method, which could detect as little as 0. 1 pg of purified virus. The detection sensitivity of IC-RT-PCR for CGMMV-infected plant tissues was about 400 times higher than that of TAS-ELISA and DBIA. Conclusions The established ACP-ELISA, TAS-ELISA, DBIA and DTBIA are suitable for routine CGMMV detection of large-scale samples in the field survey, while IC-RT-PCR is more sensitive and suitable for acquiring information about the viral genome. </p...|$|R
40|$|RNA {{silencing}} is an evolutionarily conserved antiviral mechanism, {{through which}} virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) playing roles in host antiviral defence are produced in virus-infected plant. Deep sequencing technology has revolutionized the {{study on the}} interaction between virus and plant host through the analysis of vsiRNAs profile. However, comparison of vsiRNA profiles in different tissues from a same host plant has been rarely reported. In this study, the profiles of virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) from leaves and fruits of Lagenaria siceraria plants infected with <b>Cucumber</b> green mottle <b>mosaic</b> virus (CGMMV) were comprehensively characterized and compared. Many more vsiRNAs were present in infected leaves than in fruits. vsiRNAs from both leaves and fruits were mostly 21 - and 22 -nt in size as previously described in other virus-infected plants. Interestingly, vsiRNAs were predominantly produced from the viral positive strand RNAs in infected leaves, whereas in infected fruits they were derived equally from {{the positive and negative}} strands. Many leaf-specific positive vsiRNAs with lengths of 21 -nt (2, 058) or 22 -nt (3, 996) were identified but only six (21 -nt) and one (22 -nt) positive vsiRNAs were found to be specific to fruits. vsiRNAs hotspots were only present in the 5 ’-terminal and 3 ’-terminal of viral positive strand in fruits, while multiple hotspots were identified in leaves. Differences in GC content and 5 '-terminal nucleotide of vsiRNAs were also observed in the two organs.

40|$|Cucurbit {{production}} worldwide {{is affected}} by modern agricultural technologies that require massive investments of capital and knowledge. Viral diseases of cucurbit crops result in heavy yield losses, and may even jeopardize the production of these crops. The classical crop {{breeding for disease resistance}} in cucurbits is severely hampered by the lack of natural sources of durable resistance {{to some of the most}} destructive viruses. The generation of viral resistance by means of genetic engineering was reported and widely implemented for several crops, including cucurbits. Our laboratories have been involved in the evaluation of several genetic constructs for the generation of transgenic resistance to different groups of RNA viruses known to severely affect cucurbit crops. The first construct included a fragment from the <b>Cucumber</b> fruit mottle <b>mosaic</b> virus (CFMMV) replicase gene. Several transgenic cucumber lines harboring these sequences showed a high degree of resistance to the virus when challenged by different inoculation methods. The second construct includes replicase fragments from 3 viruses belonging to different groups: Cucumber vein yellow virus (CVYV), Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus (CYSDV) and CFMMV. None of the transgenic cucumber lines showed resistance to the all three viruses. However, some lines show high levels of resistance to CFMMV and partial resistance to CVYV. The third construct was designed in a hairpin configuration and contains two identical fragments from the HcPro gene of Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) in opposite orientations, resulting in a dsRNA transcript which potentially may cause virus silencing. Several transgenic cucumber lines which harbor this construct show high levels of resistance to ZYMV and resistance against Papaya ringspot virus-W. The successful development of transgenic resistance to cucurbit viruses supports its application whenever classical resistance breeding is impractical. Cucurbitaceae 2008. IX EUCARPIA Meeting.
