5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Second World War, Fred Hoyle worked on the problem of how the various observed elements in the universe were produced. In 1946 he proposed that a massive star could generate the necessary thermonuclear reactions, and the nuclear reactions of heavy elements were responsible for the removal of energy necessary for a gravitational collapse to occur. The <b>collapsing</b> <b>star</b> became rotationally unstable, and produced an explosive expulsion of elements that were distributed into interstellar space. The concept that rapid nuclear fusion was the source of energy for a supernova explosion was developed by Hoyle and William Fowler during the 1960s.|$|E

500|$|A long-standing puzzle {{surrounding}} Type II supernovae is why {{the remaining}} compact object receives a large velocity away from the epicentre; pulsars, and thus neutron stars, are observed to have high velocities, and black holes presumably do as well, although they are far harder to observe in isolation. The initial impetus can be substantial, propelling an object {{of more than a}} solar mass at a velocity of 500km/s or greater. This indicates an expansion asymmetry, but the mechanism by which momentum is transferred to the compact object [...] a puzzle. Proposed explanations for this kick include convection in the <b>collapsing</b> <b>star</b> and jet production during neutron star formation.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} quantum {{harmonic}} oscillator {{model of a}} <b>collapsed</b> <b>star</b> trapped in the potential well of its gravitational field. The model incorporates quantum matter (quantum fields) as a source to classical gravitational field.

2500|$|In this spacetime, it is {{possible}} to come up with coordinate systems such that if you pick a hypersurface of constant time (a set of points that all have the same time coordinate, such that every point on the surface has a space-like separation, giving what is called a 'space-like surface') and draw an [...] "embedding diagram" [...] depicting the curvature of space at that time, the embedding diagram will look like a tube connecting the two exterior regions, known as an [...] "EinsteinRosen bridge". Note that the Schwarzschild metric describes an idealized black hole that exists eternally from the perspective of external observers; a more realistic black hole that forms at some particular time from a <b>collapsing</b> <b>star</b> would require a different metric. When the infalling stellar matter is added to a diagram of a black hole's history, it removes the part of the diagram corresponding to the white hole interior region, along with the part of the diagram corresponding to the other universe.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most distant}} astronomical object yet {{announced}} as of January 2011 is a galaxy candidate classified UDFj-39546284. In 2009, a gamma ray burst, GRB 090423, {{was found to}} have a redshift of 8.2, which indicates that the <b>collapsing</b> <b>star</b> that caused it exploded when the Universe was only 630 million years old. The burst happened approximately 13 billion years ago, so a distance of about 13 billion light years was widely quoted in the media (or sometimes a more precise figure of 13.035 billion light years), though this would be the [...] "light travel distance" [...] (see Distance measures (cosmology)) rather than the [...] "proper distance" [...] used in both Hubble's law and in defining the size of the observable universe (cosmologist Ned Wright argues against the common use of light travel distance in astronomical press releases on , and {{at the bottom of the}} page offers online calculators that can be used to calculate the current proper distance to a distant object in a flat universe based on either the redshift z or the light travel time). The proper distance for a redshift of 8.2 would be about 9.2 Gpc, or about 30 billion light years. Another record-holder for most distant object is a galaxy observed through and located beyond Abell 2218, also with a light travel distance of approximately 13 billion light years from Earth, with observations from the Hubble telescope indicating a redshift between 6.6 and 7.1, and observations from Keck telescopes indicating a redshift towards the upper end of this range, around 7. The galaxy's light now observable on Earth would have begun to emanate from its source about 750 million years after the Big Bang.|$|E

5000|$|The {{origins of}} the strong {{magnetic}} field are as yet unclear. One hypothesis is that of [...] "flux freezing", or conservation of the original magnetic flux takes place during {{the formation of the}} neutron star. If an object has a certain magnetic flux over its surface area, and that area shrinks to a smaller area, but the magnetic flux is conserved, then the magnetic field would correspondingly increase.

50|$|The {{gravitational}} {{collapse of a}} star is a natural process that can produce a black hole. It is inevitable {{at the end of}} the life of a star, when all stellar energy sources are exhausted. If the mass of the collapsing part of the star is below the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit for neutron-degenerate matter, the end product is a compact star — either a white dwarf (for masses below the Chandrasekhar limit) or a neutron star or a (hypothetical) quark star. If the <b>collapsing</b> <b>star</b> has a mass exceeding the TOV limit, the crush will continue until zero volume is achieved and a black hole is formed around that point in space.|$|E

50|$|A black star {{need not}} have an event horizon, and {{may or may not}} be a {{transitional}} phase between a <b>collapsing</b> <b>star</b> and a singularity. A black star is created when matter compresses at a rate significantly less than the freefall velocity of a hypothetical particle falling to the center of its star, because quantum processes create vacuum polarization, which creates a form of degeneracy pressure, preventing spacetime (and the particles held within it) from occupying the same space at the same time. This vacuum energy is theoretically unlimited, and if built up quickly enough, will stop gravitational collapse from creating a singularity. This may entail an ever-decreasing rate of collapse, leading to an infinite collapse time, or asymptotically approaching a radius less than zero.|$|E

40|$|A {{large part}} of energy from space is coming from <b>collapsing</b> <b>stars</b> (SN, Hypernovae) and <b>collapsed</b> <b>stars</b> (black holes, neutron stars and white dwarfs). The peak of their energy release is in the hard-X and gamma-ray {{wavelengths}} where photons are insensitive to absorption and can travel from the edge the Universe or the central core of the Galaxy without loosing the primordial information of energy, time signature and polarization.
