40|$|<b>Community</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses - {{termination}} {{and settlement}} The topic of my thesis is called Community property between spouses, its termination and settlement. I have chosen this particular topic because I {{am interested in}} this area and in civil law in general and also I find it very important. <b>Community</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses is a specific type <b>of</b> <b>property</b> partnership, which can exist only between spouses. The <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses origins and terminates together with the marriage. Upon the termination <b>of</b> marriage, <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses also terminates and needs to be settled. The thesis is composed of six chapters which further include under-chapters and sections. At the beginning there is an introduction into the history and development of the legal regulations <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses. Attention is given to the great amendment of the Civil Code carried into affect by Act No. 91 / 1998 Coll., which has brought many changes into the legal regulations <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses. Chapter two defines the basic terms connected with the issue <b>of</b> the <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses, namely concept, establishment, subject <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses, <b>property</b> assets and debits of the spouses, exclusive <b>property</b> <b>of</b> each of them and also community property in connection with [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} issues {{concerning}} <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses {{with a special}} regard to its settlement. The objective of the thesis is to summarize the development <b>of</b> <b>property</b> regimes between spouses starting from community property up to the current legislation, that {{has been subjected to}} a detailed analysis and evaluated {{in the context of the}} previous regulation as well as other valid legal institutes, which are of matters similiar to those <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>property</b> settlement. The first chapter of the general part of the thesis provides a brief summary of previous regulation <b>of</b> matrimonial <b>property</b> regimes and focusing on three principal questions, namely the extent <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses, the possibility to adjust the extent <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses and the settlement <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>property.</b> The second chapter covers the principal concepts that are relevant to the settlement <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses. The key part of thesis begins with a summary of fundamental changes, concerning the community property settlement, that were established by the new Civil Code in 2014. The chapter dealing with the extent <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses first emphasizes the changes of the extent <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>property,</b> and then concentrates on the most important ones, that have influence [...] ...|$|R

25|$|An act of {{insolvency}} {{committed by}} a spouse {{in a marriage}} in <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> operates {{as an act of}} insolvency by both spouses, and is therefore a good basis for sequestration of the joint estate.|$|E

This is in contrast to the Australian de facto and married regimes where all property is in the pool, unless a couple actively opt out with a binding financial contract drawn up by lawyers and they also have to be resident in Australia to do that.|$|E

25|$|If the {{insolvent}} {{is married}} out of <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> and the spouses are not living apart under a judicial order of separation, then on sequestration the solvent spouse's property also vests in the insolvent's trustee {{as if it}} were the insolvent's property. The solvent spouse may reclaim such property as he proves to be his own property. Until such property is released by the trustee pursuant to such claim, the solvent spouse does not have the usual powers of ownership. A court may, either at the time of granting the sequestration order or at a later stage, exclude the solvent spouse's property from the operation of the sequestration on certain grounds.|$|E
60|$|The {{objection}} ordinarily made to {{a system}} of <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> and equal distribution of the produce, that each person would be incessantly occupied in evading his fair share of the work, points, undoubtedly, to a real difficulty. But those who urge this objection forget to how great an extent the same difficulty exists under the system on which nine tenths of the business of society is now conducted. And though the “master’s eye,” when the master is vigilant and intelligent, is of proverbial value, it must be remembered that, in a Socialist farm or manufactory, each laborer would be under the eye, not of one master, but of the whole community. If Communistic labor might be less vigorous than that of a peasant proprietor, or a workman laboring on his own account, it would probably be more energetic than that of a laborer for hire, who has no personal interest in the matter at all.|$|E

He was somewhat lightly made, though he looked wiry, and held himself well, and there was a certain languidness in his smile which seemed to suggest that he was not addicted to troubling greatly about anything. Because the Scotchman who ran the Estremedura's engines had sold his white uniform jacket with the resplendent buttons a day or two before, he was just then attired somewhat incongruously in a white cap with the very large and imposing badge of the Spanish mail service clasped into the front of it, a brown alpaca jacket, white duck trousers, and pipe-clayed shoes. The latter two items were, however, by no means immaculate, since he had, as a special favour to the mate, brought off certain sheep and goats in his despatch-boat, as well as a camel tied astern of it. Spaniards and Englishmen do not invariably agree, but they lived like brothers on board the Estremedura, which, however, had its disadvantages.

40|$|Proving in {{the process}} of {{termination}} and settlement <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses This thesis deals with the issue of evidence in civil proceedings {{in the process}} of termination and settlement <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses, primarily {{from the point of view}} of civil procedural law. However, it is necessary to discuss briefly the issues of civil substantive law. Therefore, Chapter One analyses general questions about <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses as a concept of civil substantive law - the formation, alteration, termination and settlement <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>property.</b> The following chapters are listed according to the course of civil proceedings. Chapter Two focuses on the commencement of civil proceedings and the trial. Chapter Three concentrates on evidence. First, it answers some general questions about evidence and then it addresses the issue of evidence specifically {{in the process of}} termination and settlement <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>property.</b> Next it focuses on the stages and general principles of evidence, on the concept and the subject of proving and on individual means of proof. Subsequently, the thesis scrutinizes the position of the court and the parties to a case in the proving process and deals with the issue of burden of allegation and burden of proof. Furthermore, the chapter summarizes the [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Marriage is a {{topic that}} more or less {{concerns}} all <b>of</b> us. <b>Community</b> <b>property</b> is a financial aspect of marriage which is inseparably tied to it. Despite it being a fundamental problem, it is not well known to the general public. For this reason {{the aim of this}} diploma thesis is to clearly and systematically summarize the issue <b>of</b> contractual marital <b>property</b> law. For better understanding, the thesis defines basic terms <b>of</b> statutory matrimonial <b>property</b> regime, and focuses on parts <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses. Attention is focused on the issue of usual family equipment, because it was removed from the matrimonial property law due to recodification, which then instituted a new matrimonial regime: The Separate Property Regime. Except for the statutory matrimonial property regime, spouses are allowed to negotiate different property regime by using a contract <b>of</b> modification <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> spouses. The contractual matrimonial property regime represents a major part of this thesis.
