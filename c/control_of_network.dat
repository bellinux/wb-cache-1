50|$|Before the {{development}} of stateful firewalls, firewalls were stateless. A stateless firewall treats each network frame or packet individually.

Such a firewall has no way of knowing if any given packet is part of an existing connection, is trying to establish a new connection, or is just a rogue packet.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} effects of prolonged low workload on operator performance in the context <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> a <b>network</b> <b>of</b> unmanned vehicles (UxVs) in a search, track, and destroy mission {{with the assistance of}} an automated planner. In addition, this research focused on assessing the physical, social, and cognitive coping mechanisms that operators rely upon during prolonged low workload missions. An experiment was conducted to collect data for researching the impact of low workload in human supervisory <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>networked,</b> heterogeneous UxVs. This research showed that performance was not necessarily affected {{at the low end of}} the workload spectrum, especially in the context <b>of</b> human supervisory <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>networked</b> UxVs. Given varying levels of low taskload, operators tended to gravitate toward a common total utilization (percent busy time) that was well above the required utilization. The boredom due to the low taskload environment caused operators to spend the majority of their time distracted; to a lesser degree, operators were more directed than divided in terms of attention. More directed attention predicted higher operator performance, especially in the tracking portion of the mission. Higher utilization predicted improved operator performance in search and destroy tasks, but hindered the automation's ability to track targets. Video gaming experience was a detriment to destroying hostile targets in this long duration, low workload mission involving human supervisory <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>networked</b> UxVs. Vigilance, shown by a decrement in amount of directed attention per hour, decreased over the course of the mission duration. Top performers had higher directed attention and coped with the boredom through extreme focus or use of switching times to stay engaged in the mission. In comparison to a moderate workload study, participants in this low workload experiment performed both better and worse. Low workload did not necessarily cause a drop in operator performance. by Christin S. Hart. Thesis (S. M.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 2010.

40|$|This thesis treats of QoS (Quality of Service) in UMTS system. The term {{quality of}} service is {{frequently}} used, recently, however not only in computer networks, but also {{more and more in}} mobile networks also. Present system of 2 nd generation (2 G) GSM enables only limited exploitation of QoS function. System UMTS is a system of 3 rd generation (3 G) already and contains {{quality of service}} in greater measure which is ensured with number of algorithms and functions. Individual QoS functions enable effective utilization of radio interface, support maintenance of planned coverage and offer high spectral efficiency. Functions that cater to quality of service are called RRM functions (Radio Resource Management). There exist five basic functions in UMTS system that are Admission control (AC), Power control (PC), Load control (LC), Handover control (HC) and Packet scheduler (PS). These functions are responsible for <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>network</b> access, control of power, <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>network</b> load, control of handover and packet (bit rate) scheduling. Last three functions are usually collectively designated as Congestion control, <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>network</b> overload.

In thesis the attention is piad to Admission control algorithm – <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>network</b> access – in the uplink direction and to different ways of load (in the cell) modeling.
