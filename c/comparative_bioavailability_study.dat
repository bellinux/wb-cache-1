In other respects the preparations were pharmacokinetically equivalent. Analysis of simultaneous plasma CBZ and CBZ-EP concentration-time data by iterative curve fitting to a one-compartment linear model permitted the calculation of elimination kinetic parameters of the CBZ-EP; the mean elimination half-life was 6. 9 ± 2. 7 h.

This observation has provided a rationale to improve the formulation of Boswellia extract. We present here the results of a murine <b>comparative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> <b>study</b> of Casperome™, a soy lecithin formulation of standardized B. serrata gum resin extract (BE), and its corresponding non-formulated extract. The concentration of the six major BAs [11 -keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA), acetyl- 11 -keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), β-boswellic acid (βBA), acetyl-β-boswellic acid (AβBA), α-boswellic acid (αBA), and acetyl-α-boswellic acid (AαBA) ] was evaluated in the plasma and in a series of tissues (brain, muscle, eye, liver and kidney), providing the first data on tissue distribution of BAs. Weight equivalent and equimolar oral administration of Casperome™ provided significantly higher plasma levels (up to 7 -fold for KBA, and 3 -fold for βBA quantified as area under the plasma concentration time curve, AUClast) compared to the non-formulated extract. This was accompanied by remarkably higher tissue levels. Of particular relevance was the marked increase in brain concentration of KBA and AKBA (35 -fold) as well as βBA (3 -fold) following Casperome™ administration. Notably, up to 17 times higher BA levels were observed in poorly vascularized organs such as the eye.

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{acceptance of}} topical formulations intended for local and/or regional activity has prompted {{renewed interest in}} developing a model to determine the bioavailability of drugs {{in order to establish}} bioequivalence as a means of evaluating formulation performance of multisource products and also for use during formulation development. Current in vivo techniques such as blister suction and skin biopsy amongst others used to determine the bioavailability and/or bioequivalence of topical formulations are either too invasive to generate appropriate concentration-time profiles or require large numbers of study subjects thereby making the study expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, there are currently no sampling techniques that can demonstrate dermal bioavailability and/or bioequivalence of topical formulations intended for local and/or regional activity. Dermal microdialysis is a relatively new application of microdialysis that permits continuous monitoring of endogenous and/or exogenous solutes in the interstitial fluid. The technique is involves the implantation of semi-permeable membranes which are perfused with an isotonic medium at extremely slow flow rates and collection of microlitre sample volumes containing diffused drugs. Tape stripping, a relatively older technique, has been extensively used in <b>comparative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> <b>studies</b> of various topical formulations. However, due to shortcomings arising from reproducibility and inter-subject variation amongst others, the published FDA guidance outlining the initial protocol was subsequently withdrawn. The incorporation of transepidermal water loss with tape stripping has garnered renewed interest and has been used for the determination of drug bioavailability from a number of topical formulations. Hence the primary objective of this research is to develop and evaluate microdialysis sampling and tape stripping techniques, including the incorporation of the determination of transepidermal water loss, to assess the dermal bioavailability of ketoprofen from topical gel formulations and to develop models for bioequivalence assessment. A rapid UPLC-MS/MS method with requisite sensitivity for the analysis of samples generated from dermal microdialysis was developed and validated which accommodated the microlitre sample volumes collected. An HPLC-UV method was developed and validated for the analysis of samples generated from the in vitro microdialysis and in vivo tape stripping studies.

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} the human skin {{blanching}} assay were evaluated {{in an attempt to}} suggest improvements in the methodology of this assay. Three trials were performed in the unoccluded application mode, using two proprietary creams containing 0, 1 % betamethasone (as the 17 -valerate). Preliminary observations of the influence of ambient temperature and relative humidity on the blanching response did not allow definite conclusions to be drawn. Studies on the number of observers required for reliable results of comparative blanching indicated that at least two trained observers should be employed. Analyses of the results of individual volunteers demonstrated the expected biological variability, and suggest that subjects selected for trials should represent a range of blanching responses. No sex-related differences in blanching responses were found, and both arms exhibited similar sensitivity to corticosteroids. Retrospective analysis of 95 040 observations of blanching responses showed that in the unoccluded application mode blanching is lowest close to the wrist, and in the occluded mode blanching is lowest close to the elbow. Studies on the method of transportation of Betnovate preparations suggest that topical formulations should not be exposed to temperature extremes during transportation. It is proposed that patients should not transport topical formulations in the holds of ships or aircraft, and that exporters and manufacturers should make use of special transportation and storage conditions. In a study of ten topical formulations from three countries it was found that there was no trend of products from one country consistently exhibiting superior blanching to products from the other two countries, or products from one country consistently exhibiting the lowest degree of blanching, although considerable differences in blanching responses were found in some cases.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmacology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Cyclosporine {{forms the}} {{cornerstone}} of therapy to prevent rejection after organ transplantation. However, the clinical use of the drug is compromised by a narrow therapeutic window and a wide inter- and intra-individual variation in metabolism. Cyclosporine is metabolised by the CYP 3 A 4 isoenzymes in both the liver and intestine, while {{it has been reported}} that the metabolism of the drug can be inhibited by certain furocoumarin derivatives in grapefruit juice. Methoxsalen (8 -methoxypsoralen) is a furocoumarin and a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P 450 system in both the liver and intestine. The study was conducted to investigate the possibility whether methoxsalen may inhibit the metabolism of cyclosporine and thereby increase the bioavailability of the drug. The interaction is of clinical relevance since both drugs are used in the treatment of psoriases. The study, conducted in 12 healthy male volunteers, was a three-way <b>comparative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> <b>study</b> with a wash out period of one week between treatments. The patients received 40 mg methoxsalen, 200 mg cyclosporine or a combination of the two on three separate occasions. Blood samples of 10 ml were collected by venupuncture at the following times: 0, 0. 5, 1, 1. 5, 2, 2. 5, 3. 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours after drug administration. Methoxsalen was analysed by a high pressure liquid chromatograph method (HPLC) with UV detection (LOQ = 10 ng/ml), while cyclosporine was analysed using a fluorescence polarisation immunoassay (FPIA) technique. There was a statistical significant difference in AUCo- 00 and Cmax ' for cyclosporine when methoxsalen was added to the drug regimen. When the methoxsalen levels were compared with those in the presence of cyclosporine, the levels were lower, although the difference was not statistical significant. We conclude that methoxsalen increase the levels of cyclosporine by inhibiting the P 450 system enzymes in the liver and intestine. However, the absorption of methoxsalen is highly variable in the same individual which needs to be considered before this interaction can be regarded as being of any clinical relevance. Master...|$|E

Both full factorial and Box-Wilson designs, in consecutive manner, were used to investigate for the influences of these formulation variables on the developed dosage form performance and drug release. Responses selected for optimization of the dosage form using central composite design were tablet swelling, onset of buoyancy, buoyancy duration, time for 50 % drug release (T 50 %), percent of drug released after 1 hour (Rel%- 1) and percent of drug released after 6 hours (Rel%- 6). Although both drug: PVP ratio and hardness were shown to influence the swelling ability of the developed tablets, only tablet hardness has revealed an influential effect on tablet onset of floating. Whilst reduction in drug: PVP ratio resulted in terminalacceleration of drug release, the effect of tablet hardness on drug release was shown to be more evident in the initial phase of drug release (p 6 hours. Concerning drug release, the formula showed evidence of 25 and 84 % drug release after 1 and 6 hours, respectively, with T 50 %of 3 hours. Moreover, release kinetics of the drug from the optimized formula was shown to be near the desired zero order type of release (n = 0. 8897 ± 0. 0132; r 2 = 0. 9993).

Available formulations have limitations making their widespread use complex. METHODS: An open-label <b>comparative</b> <b>bioavailability</b> (randomized crossover) <b>study</b> compared a novel twice-daily minitab sprinkle formulation (40 mg/ 10 mg, Cipla Pharmaceuticals) versus innovator syrup in HIV-infected Ugandan infants aged 3 to < 12 months (cohort A) and children aged 1 - 4 years (cohort B) and versus Cipla tablets (100 / 25 mg) in children aged 4 to < 13 years (cohort C). Twelve-hour intensive pharmacokinetic sampling after observed LPV/r intake (plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) following World Health Organization 2010 dosing with food was performed 4 weeks after enrollment. Children then switched formulation; sampling was repeated at week 8. Acceptability data were also collected. RESULTS: Seventy-seven infants/children {{were included in}} cohort A (n = 19) /B (n = 26) /C (n = 32). Among 132 evaluable pharmacokinetic profiles, there were 13 / 21 / 25 within-child comparisons in cohort A/B/C. For minitabs versus syrup, geometric mean [95 % confidence interval (CI) ] AUC 0 - 12 h was 88. 6 (66. 7 - 117. 6) versus 77. 6 (49. 5 - 121. 5) h. mg/L in cohort A [geometric mean ratio (GMR) (90 % CI) = 1. 14 (0. 71 to 1. 85) ] and 138. 7 (118. 2 to 162. 6) versus 109. 1 (93. 7 to 127. 1) h. mg/L in cohort B [GMR (90 % CI) = 1. 27 (1. 10 to 1. 46) ]. For minitabs versus tablets, geometric mean (95 % CI) AUC 0 - 12 h was 83. 1 (66. 7 to 103. 5) versus 115. 6 (103. 0 to 129. 7) h. mg/L; GMR (90 % CI) = 0. 72 (0. 60 to 0. 86). Subtherapeutic levels (< 1. 0 mg/L) occurred in 0 (0 %) / 2 (15 %) minitabs/syrup in infants (P = 0. 48), no children aged 1 - 4 years and 4 (16 %) / 1 (4 %) minitabs/tablets (P = 0. 35). About 13 / 17 (76 %) and 19 / 26 (73 %) caregivers of infants and children aged 1 - 4 years, respectively, chose to continue minitabs after week 8, mainly for convenience; only 7 / 29 (24 %) older children (five < 6 years) remained on minitabs. CONCLUSIONS: LPV/r exposure from minitabs was comparable with syrup, but lower than tablets, with {{no significant differences in}} subtherapeutic concentrations. Minitabs were more acceptable than syrups for younger children, but older children preferred tablets...|$|R

V. Patel Pharmaceutical Education and Research Development Centre, 5 Director, B. V. Patel PERD Centre, and Project Director, NIPER, Ahmedabad, IndiaBackground: A new {{propylene}} glycol-free and reduced-volume {{formulation of}} diclofenac sodium 75 mg/mL designed for intradeltoid {{administration has been}} found to be bioequivalent to a reference formulation of diclofenac sodium 75 mg/ 3 mL given via the intragluteal route in normal healthy volunteers. Standard needles may not reach the gluteus maximus muscle in many cases, especially in the obese. The objective of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of the new formulation and compare the bioavailability of intradeltoid diclofenac sodium 75 mg/mL with that of the intragluteal 75 mg/ 3 mL reference formulation in obese volunteers. Methods: A <b>comparative,</b> two-way, single-dose, <b>bioavailability</b> <b>study</b> was carried out in 10 obese (body mass index &gt; 25) male Indian volunteers after a washout period of seven days. Blood samples were collected until six hours following drug administration and analyzed using a prevalidated high-pressure liquid chromatography method. Results: The mean maximum plasma concentration and time to reach maximum plasma concentration for the test formulation were 1. 30 &micro;g/mL and 0. 50 hours, respectively, versus 0. 93 &micro;g/mL and 1. 08 hours for the reference formulation. The mean areas under the curve from 0 to last measurable time point (AUC 0 &ndash;t) for the test and reference formulations were 2. 71 &micro;g&bull;h/mL and 2. 73 &micro;g&bull;h/mL, respectively. The mean AUCs from 0 to infinity (AUC 0 &ndash;&infin;) for the test and reference formulations were 3. 71 &micro;g&bull;h/mL and 3. 75 &micro;g&bull;h/mL, respectively. Conclusion: The results suggest that the test formulation of diclofenac sodium 75 mg/mL has an AUC 0 &ndash;t and AUC 0 &ndash;&infin; comparable with the reference intragluteal formulation of diclofenac sodium 75 mg/ 3 mL, but with an earlier time to reach maximum plasma concentration and a trend towards a higher maximum plasma concentration. This could be attributed to faster absorption from the deltoid region than from the gluteal region. The test formulation could be helpful in the management of pain in obese or overweight patients and those with dense subcutaneous fat in the gluteal area.
