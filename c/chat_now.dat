Instant messaging based <b>chat</b> is <b>now</b> rapidly becoming a mainstream communication medium even in business environments. The same is becoming true for Voice over IP enabled audio communication. Skype, a high quality VoIP software has been downloaded over 200 million times and internet providers start to sell transparent VoIP products, which are usable with ordinary telephones. But these new technologies require new communication choices. We conducted an experiment to observe the effect of these new communication media on groups of four using chat or audio communication to work on tasks of uncertainty or equivocality. The results showed that audio groups were significantly more productive than chat groups for tasks of equivocality, while chat communication groups proved to be at least as productive as audio groups on tasks of uncertainty. Therefore we wanted to explore further, why these effects happened and what factors influenced the productivity of the groups. Based on our previous research and the media richness theory and the theory of media synchronicity the paper poses the hypothesis, that audio communication is faster, while chat communication is more efficient...|$|R
60|$|In {{a moment}} the troopers were gone, and before many moments they had splashed across the river at {{what is now called}} Buckley's Ford, and plunged into the woods. They {{followed}} a beaten track that wound along the northern bank of the river. The boughs of the birch and quicken trees mingled above, and hid the cloudy moonlight, leaving the pathway in almost complete darkness. They rode at a rapid trot, <b>now</b> <b>chatting</b> together, <b>now</b> watching some stray weasel or rabbit scuttling away in the darkness. Gradually, as the gloom and silence of the woods oppressed them, they drew closer together, and began to talk rapidly; they were old comrades and knew each other's lives. One was married, and told how glad his wife would be to see him return safe from this harebrained expedition against the White Friars, and to hear how fortune had made amends for rashness. The oldest of the five, whose wife was dead, spoke of a flagon of wine which awaited him upon an upper shelf; while a third, who was the youngest, had a sweetheart watching for his return, and he rode a little way before the others, not talking at all. Suddenly the young man stopped, and they saw that his horse was trembling. 'I saw something,' he said, 'and yet I do not know but it may {{have been one of the}} shadows. It looked like a great worm with a silver crown upon his head.' One of the five put his hand up to his forehead as if about to cross himself, but remembering that he had changed his religion he put it down, and said: 'I am certain it was but a shadow, for there are a great many about us, and of very strange kinds.' Then they rode on in silence. It had been raining in the earlier part of the day, and the drops fell from the branches, wetting their hair and their shoulders. In a little they began to talk again. They had been in many battles against many a rebel together, and now told each other over again the story of their wounds, and so awakened in their hearts the strongest of all fellowships, the fellowship of the sword, and half forgot the terrible solitude of the woods.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} readers of Issues in Integrative Studies to cultural historical activity theory (CHAT). CHAT represents a systems approach to understanding the sociocultural matrix in which knowledge is transmitted and transformed. Although it was developed in the context of early-childhood learning, <b>CHAT</b> is <b>now</b> invoked in a wide variety of educational and organizational settings. To ground an overview of this intricate theory, we begin the paper by summarizing our own recent study of an issue in integrative learning. That study addressed the challenges of cross-disciplinary integration for students in a professional graduate program of water resources science, policy, and management. In the paper’s second major section, we present the origins and development of CHAT and current research based on it. In the final section, referring again to the water program study, we explain how CHAT’s conceptual and descriptive tools could be employed to help students integrate knowledge across disciplines in the context of water-related social issues. We hope that this introduction to CHAT suggests to readers other applications of the theory in situations where the object is to understand dynamic connections among interlocked systems. The general relevance of CHAT to the integrative studies community may lie in its demonstrating the critical importance, to the productive growth of any collective endeavor, of identifying, engaging, and expanding beyond inevitable systemic contradictions. During the past half-century, in the United States and throughout the world, interdisciplinary education, research, and organizational practice have become increasingly widespread. Because interdisciplinarity raises many interesting questions, it has stimulated lively thought and discussion. In this energetically developing field, pioneer scholars William Newel...|$|R

Young Ando, Kimiko and Sylar are brought in as witnesses for the prosecution and used against him and Hiro testifies for himself and is found guilty.

40|$|Urban waste {{disposal}} occurred on fenland {{to the west}} of Manchester, England, between 1900 and 1964. The reclaimed fenland, <b>Chat</b> Moss, is <b>now</b> used for mixed arable farming. A total of 1. 92 Mt of waste including privy midden, street sweepings, clinkers and slaughterhouse refuse was incorporated into the moss resulting in a modified topsoil with raised pH and reduced organic matter content compared with the subsoil. Elevated levels of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) are observed in the topsoil beyond the typical depth of atmospheric contamination; Cd and As concentrations exceed soil guideline values (SGVs) at 1. 8 and 43 mg/kg, respectively. Sequential extraction indicates that waste-derived Pb, Zn and Ni remain predominantly in the residual fraction, whereas Cu was mainly organically bound. Arsenic was predominately found in oxide and organic matter fractions with Cd in carbonate, oxide, organic matter and residual fractions. Pot trials indicated limited uptake of PTEs by vegetables grown on the waste-amended soil, with the exception of Cd uptake by lettuce (0. 22 mg/kg FW) and Pb uptake by radish (0. 16 mg/kg FW), which exceeded current EU limits of 0. 2 and 0. 1 mg/kg FW, respectively. Hazard quotients (HQs) identified no risks to adults from consumption of vegetables grown in these soils with the exception of lettuce consumption with a HQ of 1. 4. Risks to children were slightly greater with HQs > 1 for Cd in lettuce, spinach, carrots and onion, As in lettuce, parsley and onion and for Zn in spinach. ...|$|R
