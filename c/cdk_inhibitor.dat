25|$|Olomoucine, a purine derivative, is a {{cyclin-dependent kinase}} (<b>CDK)</b> <b>inhibitor.</b> CDK is a cell-cycle {{promoting}} protein, which {{along with other}} pro-growth proteins is abnormally activated during glial scar formation. Such proteins can increase astrocyte proliferation and {{can also lead to}} cell death, thus exacerbating cellular damage at the lesion site. Administration of olomoucine peritoneally has been shown to suppress CDK function. Further, olomoucine has been shown to reduce neuronal cell death, reduce astroglial proliferation (and therefore reduce astrogliosis), and increase GAP-43 expression, a useful protein marker for neurite growth. Moreover, reduced astrocyte proliferation decreases expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), major extracellular matrix molecules associated with inhibition of neuroregneration after trauma to the CNS.|$|E

In {{addition to the}} advances with recently approved agents, ongoing research into combination therapy, such as dabrafenib and trametinib, may reveal a more effective and better-tolerated option for patients with metastatic melanoma. One important pathway in melanin synthesis involves the transcription factor MITF. The MITF gene is highly conserved and is found in people, mice, birds, and even fish. MITF production is regulated via a fairly straightforward pathway. UV radiation causes increased expression of transcription factor p53 in keratinocytes, and p53 causes these cells to produce melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), which binds to melanocortin 1 receptors (MC1R) on melanocytes. Ligand-binding at MC1R receptors activates adenylate cyclases, which produce cAMP, which activates CREB, which promote MITF expression. The targets of MITF include p16 (a <b>CDK</b> <b>inhibitor)</b> and Bcl2, a gene essential to melanocyte survival. It {{is often difficult to}} design drugs that interfere with transcription factors, but perhaps new drugs will be discovered that can impede some reaction in the pathway upstream of MITF.|$|E

50|$|Cdk {{activation}} requires two steps. First, cyclin must bind to the Cdk. In {{the second}} step, CAK must phosphorylate the cyclin-Cdk complex on the threonine residue 160, {{which is located}} in the Cdk activation segment. Since Cdks need to be free of <b>Cdk</b> <b>inhibitor</b> proteins (CKIs) and associated with cyclins in order to be activated, CAK activity is considered to be indirectly regulated by cyclins.|$|E
50|$|Cdk1-cyclin {{complexes}} {{are also}} governed by direct binding of <b>Cdk</b> <b>inhibitor</b> proteins (CKIs). One such protein, already discussed, is Sic1.

40|$|Because of {{frequent}} alterations of cell cycle regulatory genes (including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases and their regulators) {{in a lot}} of primary tumours and cancer cells, CDK became a promising target for specific inhibitors able to block the cell division.

One of the first <b>CDK</b> specific <b>inhibitors</b> was olomoucine, whose structure modifications {{led to the development of}} several more potent compounds with enhanced inhibitory activities toward CDK 1.

40|$|Extended - stage {{small cell}} lung cancer (SCLC) {{responds}} to platinum/vepeside-based first-line chemotherapy but relapses rapidly as drug-resistant tumor. Topotecan (TPT) {{is the single}} chemotherapeutic agent approved for second-line treatment of SCLC. However, the response to TPT is short-lived and novel treatment modalities need to be developed. Sequential treatment of cytotoxic drugs and inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) showed promising preclinical anticancer activity and, in the present work, combinations of TPT with <b>CDK</b> <b>inhibitors</b> olomoucine, roscovitine and CDK 4 I are shown to exhibit synergistic cytotoxic activity against SCLC cell lines. Highest activity was found against TPT-resistant NCI-H 417 and DMS 153 cell lines and moderate chemosensitizing effects against a primary SCLC cell line and sensitive GLC 19 cells at levels of <b>CDK</b> <b>inhibitors</b> which exerted low toxicity. A combination of 0. 6 μM TPT with 0. 6 μM roscovitine, exhibiting no significant cytotoxicity as single agents, reduced viability of the TPT-resistant NCI-H 417 line (IC 50 > 10 μM) by 50 %. In the TPT resistant cell lines olomoucine and roscovitine, targeting CDK 1, 2, 5, 7, were highly effective, whereas in the more sensitive cell lines CDK 4 I, inhibiting mainly CDK 4 / 6, showed activity. In NCI- 417 cells, preincubation with roscovitine for one day proved synergistic with TPT. Thus, in good accordance with previous findings, <b>CDK</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are able to convert SCLC cancer cells which are cell-cycle arrested by a blockade of topoisomerase I by TPT to apoptotic cells.

40|$|Androgen {{signaling}} {{is critical}} in prostate cancer development and progression. The co-existence of hormone responsive and irresponsive cells due to functional androgen receptor (AR) in prostate gland is the major obstacle in prostate cancer therapy models. Targeting aberrant cell cycle by novel cell cycle blocking agents is a promising strategy to treat various types of malignancies. Purvalanol and roscovitine are cyclin dependent kinase (<b>CDK)</b> <b>inhibitors</b> able to activate apoptotic cell death by inducing cell cycle arrest at G 1 /S and G 2 /M phases in cancer cells. Polyamines are unique cationic amine derivatives involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. Although the elevated intracellular level of polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) is typical for prostate gland, abnormal regulation of polyamine metabolism might result in rapid cell proliferation and, thus in prostate cancer progression. Therefore, treatment with drug-induced depletion of intracellular polyamine levels through the activated polyamine catabolism is critical to achieve successful strategies for prostate cancer. In this study we aimed to investigate the apoptotic efficiency of <b>CDK</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in three prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, DU 145 and PC 3), showing different AR expression profile. We found that both purvalanol and roscovitine were able to induce apoptosis at moderate cytotoxic concentrations by decreasing mitochondria membrane potential. The apoptotic effect of both <b>CDK</b> <b>inhibitors</b> was due to activation of caspases by modulating Bcl- 2 family members. The efficiency of drugs was quite similar on the three prostate cell lines used in this study. However, DU 145 cells were found the least sensitive against <b>CDK</b> <b>inhibitors</b> while purvalanol was more potent than roscovitine. Similarly to classical chemotherapeutic agents, both drugs could up-regulate polyamine catabolic enzymes (SSAT, SMO and PAO) in cell type dependent manner. Transient silencing of SSAT and/or inhibition of PAO/ SMO with MDL 72527 prevented CDK inhibitors-induced apoptotic cell death in DU 145 and PC 3 cells. Although roscovitine was less effective in DU 145 cells, pre-treatment with α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an inhibitor of ODC, enhanced the roscovitine-induced apoptotic cell death through the cleavage of caspase- 9 and caspase- 3. Therefore, we conclude that polyamine catabolism might have essential role in the cellular responses against <b>CDK</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in different androgen-responsive or irresponsive prostate cancer cells...|$|R

In the current study, we determined the expression and possible role of specific <b>CDK</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in podocyte proliferation in human disease characterized by podocyte injury. MethodsImmunostaining was performed for the <b>CDK</b> <b>inhibitors</b> p 21, p 27, and p 57 and the proliferation marker Ki- 67 on renal biopsies from patients with minimal change disease (MCD; N = 6), membranous glomerulopathy (MGN; N = 19), cellular variant of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS; N = 12), collapsing glomerulopathy (CG; N = 9), and HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN; N = 16). Adult nephrectomy specimens without evidence of glomerular disease served as controls (N = 9). ResultsNormal quiescent podocytes express p 27 and p 57, but not p 21. In diseases without podocyte proliferation (MCD, MGN), p 21, p 27, and p 57 expression did not change.
