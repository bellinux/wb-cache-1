25|$|All of the {{following}} forging processes can be performed at various temperatures; however, they are generally classified by whether the metal temperature is above or below the recrystallization temperature. If the temperature is above the material's recrystallization temperature it is deemed hot forging; if the temperature is below the material's recrystallization temperature but above 30% of the recrystallization temperature (on an absolute scale) it is deemed warm forging; if below 30% of the recrystallization temperature (usually room temperature) then it is deemed <b>cold</b> <b>forging.</b> The main advantage of hot forging {{is that it can}} be done more quickly and precisely, and as the metal is deformed work hardening effects are negated by the recrystallization process. <b>Cold</b> <b>forging</b> typically results in work hardening of the piece.|$|E
25|$|Some metals may {{be forged}} cold, but {{iron and steel}} are almost always hot forged. Hot forging {{prevents}} the work hardening that would result from <b>cold</b> <b>forging,</b> which would increase the difficulty of performing secondary machining operations on the piece. Also, while work hardening may be desirable in some circumstances, other methods of hardening the piece, such as heat treating, are generally more economical and more controllable.

25|$|Forging is a {{manufacturing}} process involving {{the shaping of}} metal using localized compressive forces. The blows are delivered with a hammer (often a power hammer) or a die. Forging is often classified according to the temperature at which it is performed: <b>cold</b> <b>forging</b> (a type of cold working), warm forging, or hot forging (a type of hot working). For the latter two, the metal is heated, usually in a forge. Forged parts can range in weight from less than a kilogram to hundreds of metric tons. Forging {{has been done by}} smiths for millennia; the traditional products were kitchenware, hardware, hand tools, edged weapons, cymbals, and jewellery. Since the Industrial Revolution, forged parts are widely used in mechanisms and machines wherever a component requires high strength; such forgings usually require further processing (such as machining) to achieve a finished part. Today, forging is a major worldwide industry.|$|E
2500|$|Cranks are {{constructed}} of either an aluminum alloy, titanium, carbon fiber, chromoly steel, or some less expensive steel. [...] Tubular steel cranks (such as Tioga's Revolver) can be light and very strong, are usually found on bmx bikes, and are slowly finding their way to mountain bikes (dirt jumping and urban assault). [...] Aluminum cranks may be cast, hot forged or cold forged ("cold" [...] in this context means the billet from which the crank is to be made is heated to a specified temperature well below the melting point, not room temperature). [...] <b>Cold</b> <b>forging</b> gives the metal additional strength, and the cranks can therefore be made lighter without increasing the risk of breakage. [...] Shimano [...] "Hollowtech" [...] aluminum cranks are made by forging the main arms around a hard steel insert which is then withdrawn, leaving an internal void to save weight. [...] They are then welded up before final machining.|$|E
2500|$|Ötzi's copper axe was of {{particular}} interest. [...] The axe's haft is [...] long and made from carefully worked yew with a right-angled crook at the shoulder, {{leading to the}} blade. The [...] long axe head is made of almost pure copper, produced {{by a combination of}} casting, <b>cold</b> <b>forging,</b> polishing, and sharpening. Despite the fact that copper ore sources in the Alpines are known to have been exploited at the time, a study indicated that the copper in the axe came from southern Tuscany. It was let into the forked end of the crook and fixed there using birch-tar and tight leather lashing. The blade part of the head extends out of the lashing and shows clear signs of having been used to chop and cut. At the time, such an axe would have been a valuable possession, important both as a tool and as a status symbol for the bearer.|$|E

Salah satu proses yang digunakan untuk miniaturisasi adalah proses <b>cold</b> upset <b>forging.</b> Dalam proses miniaturisasi dengan proses <b>cold</b> upset <b>forging</b> ada beberapa jenis cacat yang mungkin terjadi pada produk yang dihasilkan seperti cacat dimensi, buckling, cacat lipatan, cacat pada kualitas permukaan.

Untuk mencapai tujuan penelitian, metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah dengan eksperimen dan analisa dengan Metode Elemen Hingga. 	Dari hasil penelitian dapat disimpulkan penyebab cacat dimensi pada miniatur produk dari proses <b>cold</b> upset <b>forging</b> adalah adanya perubahan dimensi dan penampang pada cetakan yang telah melebihi batas toleransi yang disyaratkan. Perubahan dimensi dan penampang cetakan menimbulkan efek lanjutan yang juga berpengaruh pada pencapaian dimensi head produk, diantaranya kurangnya volume material benda kerja untuk bisa mencukupi volume yang diperlukan oleh cetakan, gaya upsetting yang bekerja pada material untuk pembentukan head (pada area top die) menjadi berkurang serta proses deformasi terhambat karena timbulnya cacat lipatan selama proses.
