Iron ore smelted in blast furnaces during the Han was rarely if ever cast directly into permanent molds; instead, the pig iron scraps were remelted in the cupola furnace to make <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> Cupola furnaces utilized a cold blast traveling through tuyere pipes from the bottom and over the top where the charge of charcoal and pig iron was introduced.

Addition of tin, {{at a level of}} about 0. 10 - 0. 15 mass%, seems to be the only practical way for avoiding growth of ferrite in the stable eutectoid reaction and to fully transform the matrix of the material to pearlite in the metastable eutectoid system. While the role of copper and manganese has been previously rationalized, the way tin affects the eutectoid transformation in <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> is still a matter of debate. The present work makes use of an assessment of the Fe-Sn system and of experimental data in the Fe-C-Sn system to evaluate the effect of tin on phase equilibria in this latter system.
