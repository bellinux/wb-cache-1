5|$|The Demands of Liberal Education is a 1999 {{political}} philosophy book by Meira Levinson that establishes a liberal political theory of children's education that fits the mutual {{needs of the}} state and its diverse citizenry. She writes that the intent of a liberal education—an education that follows from a liberal society's values—is to maximize the autonomy of individual <b>children</b> <b>through</b> increasing their capacity for liberty.

5|$|Although Tyler's {{family was}} dear to him, during his {{political}} rise {{he was often}} {{away from home for}} extended periods.

While in office it was difficult to practice law being away in Washington part of the year, and his plantation was also more profitable when Tyler was available to manage it himself.

5|$|Family {{issues were}} {{significant}} concerns for lesbians when gay activism became more vocal in the 1960s and 1970s. Custody issues in particular were of interest since often courts would not award custody to mothers who were openly homosexual, {{even though the}} general procedure acknowledged children were awarded to the biological mother. Several studies performed {{as a result of}} custody disputes viewed how children grow up with same-sex parents compared to single mothers who did not identify as lesbians. They found that children's mental health, happiness, and overall adjustment is similar to children of divorced women who are not lesbians. Sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex roles of children who grow up with lesbian mothers are unaffected. Differences that were found include the fact that divorced lesbians tend to be living with a partner, fathers visit divorced lesbian mothers more often than divorced nonlesbian mothers, and lesbian mothers report a greater fear of losing their <b>children</b> <b>through</b> legal means.|$|E
