The philosophical terms Tao and De {{are indeed}} shared by both Taoism and Confucianism, and Laozi is traditionally held {{to have been}} a teacher of Confucius. Zhuangzi explicitly criticized Confucianist and Mohist tenets in his work. In general, Taoism rejects the Confucianist emphasis on rituals, hierarchical social order, and <b>conventional</b> <b>morality,</b> and favors naturalness, spontaneity, and individualism instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{conventional}} {{level of}} moral reasoning {{is typical of}} adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of {{the third and fourth}} stages of moral development. <b>Conventional</b> <b>morality</b> is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.|$|E

His siblings were Lucy (1838–1878), William Jr. (1841–1922), Mary (1843–1925) and twins Franklin (Frank) (1845–1917) and Frances (1845–1847). His father was of English and German descent while his mother was of Scots-Irish descent. Bill was first a lumberman and then a traveling salesman who identified himself as a [...] "botanic physician" [...] and sold elixirs. The locals referred to the mysterious but fun-loving man as [...] "Big Bill" [...] and [...] "Devil Bill". He was a sworn foe of <b>conventional</b> <b>morality</b> who had opted for a vagabond existence and who returned to his family infrequently. Throughout his life, Bill was notorious for shady schemes. In between the births of Lucy and John, Bill and his mistress/housekeeper Nancy Brown had a daughter named Clorinda who died young.

Crowley's political thought was studied by academic Marco Pasi, who noted that for Crowley, socio-political concerns were subordinate to metaphysical and spiritual ones. Pasi {{argued that it was}} difficult to classify Crowley as being either on the political left or right but he was perhaps best categorised as a [...] "conservative revolutionary" [...] despite not being affiliated with the German-based conservative revolutionary movement. Pasi noted that Crowley sympathised with extreme ideologies like Nazism and Marxism-Leninism, in that they wished to violently overturn society and hoped that both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union might adopt Thelema. Crowley described democracy as an [...] "imbecile and nauseating cult of weakness," [...] and commented that The Book of the Law proclaimed that [...] "there is the master and there is the slave; the noble and the serf; the 'lone wolf' and the herd". In this attitude he was influenced by the work of Friedrich Nietzsche and by Social Darwinism. Although he had contempt for most of the British aristocracy, he regarded himself as an aristocrat and styled himself as Laird Boleskine, once describing his ideology as [...] "aristocratic communism".|$|E

It argues that the journal sustained a provocative campaign against <b>conventional</b> sexual <b>morality,</b> which included a vindication of sexual diversity and homosexuality. Through the writings of contributors such as Italo Tavolato and Giovanni Papini, Lacerba combined Futurist rhetoric with an elitist, iconoclastic, and irreverent conception of sexuality.

[...] For instance, Kohlberg’s <b>conventional</b> level of <b>morality</b> (between ages 9 and 13, roughly), involves moral stereotyping, empathy-based morality, alertness to and behaviour guided by predicted evaluations by others, and identifying with authority, {{all of which}} require role taking.|$|R
2500|$|The {{opinions}} of Socrates {{in any given}} dialog not only often contradict <b>conventional</b> <b>morality,</b> they also contradict his own previous opinions. For example, in the Apology, Socrates praises [...] "the son of Thetis" [...] (Achilles) for making light of death {{because he was so}} obsessed with getting revenge on Hector for killing Patroclus. In this scene, Achilles does not go in to fight, but agrees to his mother's command that he wait until she gets special battle gear made for him. Socrates invocation of Achilles as a model for his own fearlessness is misplaced because Achilles is a coward in the scene. [...] In the Republic Socrates has a different opinion of Achilles. [...] He calls him emotionally overwrought, and greedy (for taking bribes—which, according to Homer, he did not do). [...] Socrates famously argues that the Iliad needs to be rewritten.|$|E
2500|$|At {{least in}} terms of content, the majors were already there, putting out low-budget [...] "J.D." [...] movies such as Warner Bros.' Untamed Youth (1957), {{starring}} Mamie Van Doren, and MGM's High School Confidential (1958), with Van Doren and Russ Tamblyn. In Bill Osgerby's description, these films [...] "purported to preach against the 'evils' of juvenile crime, yet simultaneously provided young audiences with the vicarious thrills of delinquent rebellion", a gambit as old as St. Augustine, if not the Hollywood hills themselves. Varietys review of the Van Doren vehicle Girls Town (1959) declared, [...] "The screenplay of the film is as flimsy as a G-string, and designed for somewhat the same purpose. It includes all the staples of the exploitation film—a drag race, a necking party, the flip and shallow conversation of a segment of youth, the slight and unconvincing nod to <b>conventional</b> <b>morality</b> at the ending." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following continual police harassment, P-Orridge and Tutti {{relocated}} to London, {{moving into a}} squat and obtaining a basement studio in Hackney which they named the [...] "Death Factory". After a brief correspondence, P-Orridge met American novelist and poet William S. Burroughs, who later provided {{an introduction to the}} English poet and performance artist Dick Emery. Brion Gysin would become a major influence upon P-Orridge's ideas and works and was the latter's primary tutor in spiritual magic. 1973 saw COUM take part in the Fluxshoe retrospective that toured Britain exhibiting the work of the Fluxus artists; it was organised by David Mayor, who befriended P-Orridge. At that year's Edinburgh Festival, they undertook their Marcel Duchamp-inspired Art Vandals piece at the Richard Demarco Gallery, in which they engaged guests in unconventional conversation, and spilled their food and drink on the floor. Exhibiting alongside the Viennese Actionists, they came under increasing influence from these Austrian performance artists, adopting their emphasis on using shock tactics to combat <b>conventional</b> <b>morality.</b> September 1973 saw them produce their first film, Wundatrek Tours, which documented a day out to Brighton, while throughout the year they sent postcards that they had designed to mail-art shows across the world.|$|E

40|$|Nikki Sullivan, a {{critical}} theorist of body modification practises, examines {{similarities and differences}} between transsexual surgeries and other forms of bodily modification such as piercing, branding, tattooing, cosmetic surgery, and self-demand amputation. Sullivan contends that all such practises can be considered “trans” practises, and that, conversely, transsexual body modification can be considered simply one particular type of a wider class of phenomena. Sullivan is especially concerned with how, across a wide range of discourses, various critics tend to perpetrate moral judgements about what constitutes “good” rather than “bad” body modification practises that affirm cultural norms, and to disparage countercultural forms of bodily modification. Likewise, she points out how in various critical contexts, body modifications that mark an antithetical relationship to the dominant culture are celebrated while normalizing procedures are condemned. She then surveys a few of the ways that proscriptions emanating within both critical and <b>conventional</b> <b>moralities</b> play out with regard to transgender body modification practises. Central to Sullivan’s argument is her development of the concept of “transmogrification,” usually defined as a strange of grotesque transformation characterized by distortion, exaggeration, and “unnatural combinations. ” Rather than seeing transmogrification as a negative process that produces disavowed and abjected monstrous others, she sees it as the expression of a fundamental human condition, part of the process through which we perpetually transform ourselves in relation to an Other. In seeking to articulate an analytics of transmogrification rather than a moral condemnation of the monstrous and strange, Sullivan calls for an “intercorporeal ethics” that recognizes and welcomes our own strangeness as well as the strangeness of others. This ethical practise simultaneously seeks out common norms and modes of interpersonal engagement, and never loses sight of the notion of justice. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} based on joint and {{separate}} in-depth interviews with twenty (female) same sex couples who planned and had their children together {{in the context of}} their relationship. These families are one example of the increasing possibilities to live in non-traditional relationships and family forms, in contemporary Western societies. While lesbian and gay parents have a long history, there is little precedence for same sex couples setting up families 'from scratch' i. e. choosing to have children {{in the context of their}} relationship. These possibilities can be placed in the context of wider transformations of intimacy. There is widespread agreement that individualism in personal relationships has substantially increased, although opinions differ about the extent to which this individualism is essentially selfish. Lesbian parents, for example, have been portrayed as selfish individuals (Phillips, 1998) or alternatively as 'prime everyday experimenters' (Giddens, 1992), although the reality may be more nuanced than either of these polarities suggests. Overall, recent sociological research into both heterosexual and 'non-heterosexual' family lives suggests that transformations of intimacy are characterised by negotiated commitments and moral reasoning. However, to date, relatively little attention has been paid to the ways in which these themes may be modified by the presence of dependent children, particularly given the socially constructed nature of children's needs. Respondents in my study are involved in both innovative family practices and the care of dependent children. As such, they can offer new insights to the above debates. They present a radical departure from dominant conventions of heterosexual gendered family norms and the biological imperatives of reproduction. However, while working out new ways of doing family, these practices are located within deeply <b>conventional</b> <b>moralities</b> of motherhood, which leave little space within which to offer up new stories of doing family...|$|R
