50|$|Pharmaco{{economic}}s {{centers on}} the economic evaluation of pharmaceuticals, and can use <b>cost-minimization</b> <b>analysis,</b> cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis or cost-utility analysis. Quality-adjusted life years have become the dominant outcome of interest in pharmacoeconomic evaluations, and many studies employ a cost-per-QALY analysis. Economic evaluations are carried out alongside randomized controlled trials and using methods of decision-analytic modeling. Pharmacoeconomics is a useful method of economic evaluation of various treatment options. As more expensive drugs are being developed and licensed it has become imperative especially in context of developing countries where resources are scarce to apply the principles of pharmacoeconomics for various drugs and treatment options so that maximum improvement in quality of life can be achieved in minimum cost.|$|E

40|$|Infectious Diseases Society of America {{guidelines}} {{state that}} uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) {{should be treated}} empirically with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), unless the community resis-tance among uropathogens exceeds 10 %– 20 %, in which case a fluoroquinolone (FQ) should be used. However, the data to support this threshold are limited. We performed a <b>cost-minimization</b> and sensitivity <b>analysis</b> to determine what level of TMP-SMZ resistance in a community should trigger FQ use. The mean cost of empirical treatment with TMP-SMZ was US$ 92 when the proportion of resistant Escherichia coli was 0 %, $ 106 when it was 20 %, and $ 120 when it was 40 %. The mean cost of empirical FQ treatment was $ 107 at current levels of FQ resistance. When 122 % of E. coli in a community are TMP-SMZ–resistant, empirical FQ therapy becomes less costly than TMP-SMZ therapy. Treatment guidelines for empirical treatment of UTIs may need modifi-cation, and the threshold trigger for empirical FQ use should be raised to 120 % TMP-SMZ resistance. Over 7 million uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs [cystitis]) occur every year, contributing nearly $ 1 billion to health costs in the United States [1].

40|$|AbstractBACKGROUND: Economic {{evaluation}} {{of health care}} has developed into a substantial body of work, and its contribution to medical decision making is increasingly being recognized. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of the study was}} to describe the characteristics and quality of health economic (including pharmacoeconomic) evaluation research studies related to Zimbabwe. METHODS: A review of the literature was conducted to identify published health economic evaluation studies related to Zimbabwe. HEED, PubMed, MEDLINE, HealthSTAR, EconLit, and PsycINFO databases and sociological and dissertation abstracts were used to search for economic analyses. The searches used the following terms alone and in combination: costs, budgets, fee, economics, health, pharmacy, pharmacy services, medicines, drugs, health economics, cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit, <b>cost-minimization,</b> cost utility <b>analysis,</b> and Zimbabwe. Only original applied economic evaluations addressing a health-related topic pertaining to Zimbabwe and published in full were included. Two reviewers independently evaluated and scored each study in the final sample using the data collection form designed for the study. RESULTS: Fifty-nine studies were identified in the database searches, 18 of which were excluded because they were not about Zimbabwe (3 studies) or were not health related (15). Of the 41 remaining studies, 8 were excluded after further review because they were not original research, 6 because they were not economic analyses, and 1 because it was not about Zimbabwe. The final 26 studies appeared in 13 different journals (based mostly [17 (65 %) ] outside of Zimbabwe). The mean (SD) number of authors of each study was 3. 36 (2. 13); most of the authors had medical/clinical training. The number of studies peaked between 1994 and 1997. Based on a 10 -point scale, with 10 indicating the highest quality, the mean (SD) quality score for all studies was 5. 40 (1. 56); 8 of the studies (31 %) were considered to be of poor quality (score ≤ 4). The quality of the studies reviewed was significantly (all, P pharmaceutical interventions), the number of authors (more authors = higher), and year of publication (more recent = higher). CONCLUSION: This study indicated that the use of health economic (including pharmacoeconomic) evaluation research in Zimbabwe was low, and 31 % of the studies were of poor quality.

40|$|Although choledochoscopy for the {{prevention}} of retained bile duct stones has been postulated as cost effective, no economic evaluation exists to substantiate this claim. We performed a <b>cost-minimization</b> <b>analysis</b> on 287 patients who underwent choledochoscopy during operations for biliary tract calculi between 1981 and 1987 to assess the economic impact of choledochoscopy versus noncholedochoscopic alternatives in obtaining a stone-free duct. Common duct exploration was positive for calculi in 75 % of patients. Choledochoscopy-detected residual stones after duct exploration in 10 % of patients. Residual stones were more frequent after positive (12. 5 %) than negative (2. 7 %) duct explorations. retained stones occurred in 4. 5 % of patients after operation. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values of choledochoscopy were 67 %, 100 %, and 95 %, respectively. <b>Cost-minimization</b> <b>analysis</b> showed that total cost of either selective ($ 75, 250) or routine ($ 110, 450) choledochoscopy significantly exceeded the total cost of obtaining a stone-free duct for patients with retained stones via either extraction through a T-tube tract ($ 17, 545) or by endoscopic papillotomy ($ 45, 675). Because choledochoscopy was not economically competitive with noncholedochoscopic, nonoperative alternatives, reduction of choledochoscopy fees was implemented to economically justify continued use of choledochoscopy. We conclude that choledochoscopy is clinically efficacious in obtaining a stone-free duct, but endorsement of either routine or selective choledochoscopy by <b>cost-minimization</b> <b>analysis</b> requires careful assessment of fee structure to make choledochoscopy competitive economically...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains {{three studies}} examining aspects of energy use by data centers {{and other information}} and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure necessary to support the electronic services that now form such a pervasive aspect of daily life. The energy consumption of ICT in general and data centers in particular has been of growing interest to both industry and the public, with continued calls for increased efficiency and greater focus on environmental impacts. The first study examines the metrics used to assess data center energy performance and finds that power usage effectiveness (PUE), the de facto industry standard, only accounts for one of four critical aspects of data center energy performance. PUE measures the overhead of the facility infrastructure but does not consider {{the efficiency of the}} IT equipment, its utilization, or the emissions profile of the power source. As a result, PUE corresponds poorly with energy and carbon efficiency, as demonstrated using a small set of empirical data center energy use measurements. The second study lays out a taxonomy of indirect energy impacts to help assess whether ICT’s direct energy consumption is offset by its energy benefits, and concludes that ICT likely has a large potential net energy benefit, but that there is no consensus on the sign or magnitude of actual savings, which are largely dependent upon implementation details. The third study estimates the potential of dynamic load shifting in a content distribution network to reduce both private costs and emissions-related externalities associated with electricity consumption. Utilizing variable marginal retail prices based on wholesale electricity markets and marginal damages estimated from emissions data in a <b>cost-minimization</b> model, the <b>analysis</b> finds that load shifting can either reduce data center power bills by approximately 25 %– 33 % or avoid 30 %– 40 % of public damages, while a range of joint cost minimization strategies enables simultaneous reduction of both private and public costs. The vast majority of these savings can be achieved even under existing bandwidth and network distance constraints, although current industry trends towards virtualization, energy efficiency, and green powermay make load shifting less appealing...|$|R

Methods: A randomized multicentre study comparing totally extraperitoneal laparoscopic repair (TEP) with open repair by the Lichtenstein procedure was performed on men with a primary inguinal hernia. Long-term data on recurrences and complications up to 5 years after operation were collected. Taking treatment costs into consideration, a <b>cost-minimization</b> <b>analysis</b> was conducted. Results: A total of 1370 patients had an inguinal hernia repair, 665 in the TEP and 705 in the Lichtenstein group. The total hospital cost for the index operation was (sic) 710. 6 higher for TEP repair (P < 0. 001).

Currently, there is a worldwide shortage of transplantable tissue, and demand {{is expected to increase}} further with aging populations. Tissue-engineered alternatives are being developed, and are likely to be available soon. However, the cost of these constructs may impair their widespread use. A <b>cost-minimization</b> <b>analysis</b> comparing tissue-engineered constructs to donor tissue procured from eye banks for endothelial keratoplasty was performed. Both initial investment costs and recurring costs were considered in the analysis to arrive at a final tissue cost per transplant. The clinical outcomes of endothelial keratoplasty with tissue-engineered constructs and with donor tissue procured from eye banks were assumed to be equivalent. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to simulate various possible scenarios, and to determine the robustness of the results. A tissue engineering strategy was cheaper in both investment cost and recurring cost. Tissue-engineered constructs for endothelial keratoplasty could be produced at a cost of US$ 880 per transplant. In contrast, utilizing donor tissue procured from eye banks for endothelial keratoplasty required US$ 3, 710 per transplant. Sensitivity analyses performed further support the results of this <b>cost-minimization</b> <b>analysis</b> across a wide range of possible scenarios.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Enhanced {{recovery}} {{after surgery}} (ERAS) {{programs have been}} shown to ease the postoperative recovery and improve clinical outcomes for various surgery types. ERAS cost-effectiveness was demonstrated for colorectal surgery but not for liver surgery. The present study aim was to analyze the implementation costs and benefits of a specific ERAS program in liver surgery. METHODS: A dedicated ERAS protocol for liver surgery was implemented in our department in July 2013. The subsequent year all consecutive patients undergoing liver surgery were treated according to this protocol (ERAS group). They were compared in terms of real in-hospital costs with a patient series before ERAS implementation (pre-ERAS group). Mean costs per patient were compared with a bootstrap T test. A <b>cost-minimization</b> <b>analysis</b> was performed. RESULTS: Seventy-four ERAS patients were compared with 100 pre-ERAS patients. There were no significant pre- and intraoperative differences between the two groups, except for the laparoscopy number (n =  18 ERAS, n =  9 pre-ERAS, p =  0. 010). Overall postoperative complications were observed in 36 (49  %) and 64 patients (64  %) in the ERAS and pre-ERAS groups, respectively (p =  0. 046). The median length of stay was significantly shorter for the ERAS group (8 vs. 10  days, p =  0. 006). The total mean costs per patient were euro 38, 726 and euro 42, 356 for ERAS and pre-ERAS (p =  0. 467).

40|$|Abstract Background Both {{recombinant}} FSH (r-FSH) and highly-purified, urinary FSH (HP-uFSH) {{are frequently}} used in ovulation induction associated with timed sexual intercourse. Their effectiveness {{is reported to}} be similar, and therefore the costs of treatment represent a major issue to be considered. Although several studies about costs in IVF have been published, data obtained in low-technology infertility treatments are still scarce. Methods Two hundred and sixty infertile women (184 with unexplained infertility, 76 with CC-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome) at their first treatment cycle were randomized and included in the study. Ovulation induction was accomplished by daily administration of rFSH or HP-uFSH according to a low-dose, step-up regimen aimed to obtain a monofollicular ovulation. A bi- or tri-follicular ovulation was anyway accepted, whereas hCG was withdrawn and the cycle cancelled when more than three follicles {{greater than or equal to}} 18 mm diameter were seen at ultrasound. The primary outcome measure was the cost of therapy per delivered baby, estimated according to a <b>cost-minimization</b> <b>analysis.</b> Secondary outcomes were the following: monofollicular ovulation rate, total FSH dose, cycle cancellation rate, length of the follicular phase, number of developing follicles (> 12 mm diameter), endometrial thickness at hCG, incidence of twinning and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, delivery rate. Results The overall FSH dose needed to achieve ovulation was significantly lower with r-FSH, whereas all the other studied variables did not significantly differ with either treatments. However, a trend toward a higher delivery rate with r-FSH was observed in the whole group and also when results were considered subgrouping patients according to the indication to treatment. Conclusion Considering the significantly lower number of vials/patient and the slight (although non-significant) increase in the delivery rate with r-FSH, the <b>cost-minimization</b> <b>analysis</b> showed a 9. 4 % reduction in the overall therapy cost per born baby in favor of r-FSH. </p...|$|E

Expert opinion was used to extrapolate the probabilities to the other two hysteroscopy service models. Costs were estimated using the 2006 – 2007 NHS Reference costs. As repeat interventions would be carried out until successful removal of the pathology occurs in all three hysteroscopy service models, effectiveness was assumed to be the same.

40|$|Four {{different}} types of evaluation methods, cost-benefit analysis (CBA), cost-utility analysis (CUA), cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and <b>cost-minimization</b> <b>analysis</b> (CMA), are usually distinguished. In this note, we pronounce the (near) death of CMA by showing the rare circumstances under which CMA is an appropriate method of analysis. We {{argue that it is}} inappropriate for separate and sequential hypothesis tests on differences in effects and costs to determine whether incremental cost-effectiveness (or cost-utility) should be estimated. We further argue that the analytic focus should be on the estimation of the joint density of cost and effect differences, the quantification of uncertainty surrounding the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and the presentation of such data as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Two examples from recently published CEA are employed to illustrate the issues. The first shows a situation where analysts might be tempted (inappropriately) to employ CMA rather than CEA. The second illustrates one of the rare circumstances in which CMA may be justified as a legitimate form of analysis. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|E

The total cost of the 123 teledermatology consultations was NZ$ 34, 346 and the total cost of the 106 conventional hospital consultations was NZ$ 30, 081. The average societal cost of the teledermatology consultation was therefore NZ$ 279. 23 compared with NZ$ 283. 79 for the conventional hospital consultation. The marginal cost of seeing an additional patient was NZ$ 135 via teledermatology and NZ$ 284 via conventional hospital appointment. From a societal viewpoint, and assuming an equal outcome, teledermatology was a more cost-efficient use of resources than conventional hospital care...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} whether {{a model to}} predict a failed endometrial biopsy in women with postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) and a thickened endometrium can reduce costs without compromising diagnostic accuracy. Design, Setting, and Population. Model based <b>cost-minimization</b> <b>analysis.</b> Methods. A decision analytic model was designed to compare two diagnostic strategies for women with PMB: (I) attempting office endometrial biopsy and performing outpatient hysteroscopy after failed biopsy and (II) predicted probability of a failed endometrial biopsy based on patient characteristics to guide the decision for endometrial biopsy or immediate hysteroscopy. Robustness of assumptions regarding costs was evaluated in sensitivity analyses. Main Outcome Measures. Costs for the different strategies. Results. At different cut-offs for the predicted probability of failure of an endometrial biopsy, strategy I was generally less expensive than strategy II. The costs for strategy I were always € 460; the costs for strategy II varied between € 457 and € 475. At a 65 % cut-off, a possible saving of € 3 per woman could be achieved. Conclusions. Individualizing the decision to perform an endometrial biopsy or immediate hysteroscopy in women presenting with postmenopausal bleeding based on patient characteristics does not increase {{the efficiency of the}} diagnostic work-up...|$|E
40|$|Invasive {{aspergillosis}} is {{a life-threatening}} fungal infection predominately affecting immunocompromised individuals. The incidence of inpatient-treated aspergillosis {{cases in the}} US {{is estimated to be}} between 3. 02 and 3. 80 per 10, 000 hospitalized patients. The estimated difference in hospital costs of patients with an aspergillosis infection is US$ 36, 867 to US$ 59, 356 higher than those of patients without the infection. Voriconazole is a synthetic, broad spectrum triazole antifungal agent, with FDA-approved indications for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis, esophageal candidiasis, candidemia in nonneutropenic patients, invasive candidiasis, and infections due to Scedosporium apiospermum and Fusarium species in patients refractory to or intolerant of other therapy. Eight cost-effectiveness analyses, one <b>cost-minimization</b> <b>analysis,</b> and one cost analysis were identified from a Medline search. The 10 pharmacoeconomic analyses were conducted in six different countries comparing voriconazole to conventional amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B, itraconazole, and caspofungin. All the cost-effectiveness and cost-minimization analyses identified voriconazole as the most cost-effective therapy. The cost analysis demonstrated voriconazole cost-savings. While the acquisition costs of voriconazole are higher than those of conventional amphotericin B, the toxicity profile and rate of treatment success associated with voriconazole result in lower total treatment costs per successfully treated patient...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Enhanced {{recovery}} protocols {{may reduce}} postoperative complications {{and length of}} hospital stay. However, the implementation of these protocols requires time and financial investment. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of enhanced recovery implementation. METHODS: The first 50 consecutive patients treated during implementation of an enhanced recovery programme were compared with 50 consecutive patients treated {{in the year before}} its introduction. The enhanced recovery protocol principally implemented preoperative counselling, reduced preoperative fasting, preoperative carbohydrate loading, avoidance of premedication, optimized fluid balance, standardized postoperative analgesia, use of a no-drain policy, as well as early nutrition and mobilization. Length of stay, readmissions and complications within 30 days were compared. A <b>cost-minimization</b> <b>analysis</b> was performed. RESULTS: Hospital stay was significantly shorter in the enhanced recovery group: median 7 (interquartile range 5 - 12) versus 10 (7 - 18) days (P = 0 · 003); two patients were readmitted in each group. The rate of severe complications was lower in the enhanced recovery group (12 versus 20 per cent), but {{there was no difference in}} overall morbidity. The mean saving per patient in the enhanced recovery group was euro 1651. CONCLUSION: Enhanced recovery is cost-effective, with savings evident even in the initial implementation period...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{conduct a}} {{comprehensive}} <b>cost-minimization</b> <b>analysis</b> {{to comprehend the}} financial attributes of the first 5 years of an implementation wherein emergency department (ED) registered nurses administered HIV oral rapid tests to patients. MethodsA health science research implementation team coordinated with ED stakeholders and staff to provide training, implementation guidelines, and support to launch ED registered nurse–administered HIV oral rapid testing. Deidentified quantitative data were gathered from the electronic medical records detailing quarterly HIV rapid test rates in the ED setting spanning the first 5 years. Comprehensive cost {{analyses were conducted to}} evaluate the financial impact of this implementation. ResultsAt 5 years, a total of 2, 620 tests were conducted with a quarterly mean of 131 ± 81. Despite quarterly variability in testing rates, regression analysis revealed an average increase of 3. 58 tests per quarter. Over the course of this implementation, Veterans Health Administration policy transitioned from written to verbal consent for HIV testing, serving to reduce the time and cost(s) associated with the testing process. ConclusionsOur data indicated salient health outcome benefits for patients with respect to the potential for earlier detection, and associated long-run cost savings...|$|E
40|$|There are few cost {{evaluation}} studies of orthodontic treatment. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the costs of correcting posterior crossbites with Quad Helix (QH) or expansion plates (EPs) and to relate the costs to the effects. To determine which alternative has the lower cost, a <b>cost-minimization</b> <b>analysis</b> was undertaken, based on that the outcome of the treatment alternatives is identical. The study comprised 40 subjects in the mixed dentition, who had undergone treatment for unilateral posterior crossbite: 20 with QH and 20 with EPs. Duration of treatment, number of appointments, broken appointments, and cancellations were registered. Direct costs (for the premises, staff salaries, material and laboratory costs) and indirect costs (loss of income due to parent's assumed absence from work) were calculated and evaluated for successful treatment alone, for successful and unsuccessful treatment and re-treatment when required. The QH had significantly lower direct and indirect costs, with fewer failures requiring re-treatment. Even the costs for successful cases only were significantly lower in the QH than in the EP group. The results clearly show that in terms of cost-minimization, QH is the preferred method for correcting posterior crossbite in the mixed dentition...|$|E
