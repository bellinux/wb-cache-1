Preconditioned coupon specimens were subjected to accelerated quasirealistic mechanical and environmental flight-by-flight loading, and other coupon specimens were loaded exactly like the composite airframe structure (that is, with less complete simulated environment). Temperature and moisture content in residual strength testing were the same for surviving coupon specimens and the composite airframe structure. Different types of laminates and specimens were used to generate predominantly matrix shear stresses or fiber normal stresses within the coupon specimens.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{calculation}} of the bispectrum of the matter perturbations induced by cosmic strings. The calculation is performed in two different ways: the first uses the unequal time correlators (UETCs) of the string network - computed using a Gaussian model previously employed for cosmic string power spectra. The second approach uses the wake model, where string density perturbations are concentrated in sheet-like structures whose surface density grows with time. The qualitative and quantitative agreement of the two gives confidence to the results. An essential ingredient in the UETC approach is the inclusion of <b>compensation</b> <b>factors</b> in the integration with the Green's function of the matter and radiation fluids, and we show that these <b>compensation</b> <b>factors</b> must {{be included in the}} wake model also. We also present a comparison of the UETCs computed in the Gaussian model, and those computed in the unconnected segment model (USM) used by the standard cosmic string perturbation package CMBACT. We compare numerical estimates for the bispectrum of cosmic strings to those produced by perturbations from an inflationary era, and discover that, despite the intrinsically non-Gaussian nature of string-induced perturbations, the matter bispectrum is unlikely to produce competitive constraints on a population of cosmic strings.

40|$|Anisotropic Magnetoresistance (AMR) sensors are {{magnetic}} sensors {{often used}} for angle measurements. The sensor outputs should be two perfect sinusoidal signals that depend on the angle to be measured. However due to non-ideal properties of the sensor, the actual outputs include undesired parameters as offset voltage, amplitude imbalance and harmonics. All of them generate errors in the angle calculation. Offset voltage and amplitude imbalance are {{the first and second}} largest sources of angle errors for which until now are the mainly compensated. The required <b>compensation</b> <b>factors</b> are usually estimated {{at the start of the}} sensor life and not updated during its lifetime. Although the sources of angle errors show variations due to wearing and aging effects, so far it is considered that these variations are not significant to affect the sensor accuracy. However, this will change in the future, especially in safety-critical applications that will demand higher accuracy. Then it will be necessary to update the <b>compensation</b> <b>factors</b> during the sensor lifetime. This paper proposes an online compensation method to reduce the offset voltage, the amplitude imbalance and hence the angle error in AMR sensors. It was verified using simulated data as well as real measurements, showing a good performance in all the cases. Unlike most of the compensation methods proposed until now, our method is suitable to be used during the sensor lifetime...|$|R

5000|$|The year-by-year {{chain linking}} method differs {{from some other}} {{techniques}} for compensating for monetary inflation and deflation {{that are used in}} economics, such as the consumer price index. The consumer price index uses the observed price of a set 'market basket' of goods and services in any two given years to determine the relative prices in those two years; it does not rely on a cumulative accounting of changes in the intervening years. The consumer price index is thus an example of a fixed-weight compensation method; fixed weight methods relate prices in all years to some single base year. The problem is that the <b>compensation</b> <b>factor</b> derived from any index depends on the weights given to the various items in the market-basket [...] - [...] or the proportions of each item in whatever aggregate amount is being looked at [...] - [...] and the weights that were correct for one time may not be correct for other times. For example, in 1850 the price of horse-fodder would have been an important component of overall price levels, but now it is not. If one is comparing 1850 price levels to present ones, then, the question arises, what weight to give to horse-fodder? It is difficult to know. The chain linking method attempts to avoid this conundrum by never making large leaps in time.|$|E
