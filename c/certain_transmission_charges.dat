40|$|<b>Transmission</b> <b>charges</b> are levied against {{generators}} and suppliers {{for their use}} of transmission networks. The majority of existing <b>transmission</b> <b>charging</b> methods were designed for a system dominated by conventional and controllable generation. The resultant <b>transmission</b> <b>charges</b> reflect network users’ contribution to the system peak. The integration of renewable generation brings fundamental challenges in <b>transmission</b> planning and <b>charging.</b> Main criteria of transmission planning have changed from meeting system peak demand to the trade-offs between operational and investment costs. <b>Transmission</b> <b>charging</b> is required to effectively reflect these trade-offs. This research work aims to develop novel <b>transmission</b> <b>charging</b> methods for low carbon power systems, reflecting the contribution to transmission investments from different generation technologies, different locations, and critically different times. It firstly identifies the key drivers and key conditions of transmission investments under the economic criteria. In the second step, the key drivers and conditions {{are reflected in the}} developing of T-LRIC method, ToU-LRIC method and ToU-ICRP method. Major innovations of the proposed methods include 1. reflecting the trade-offs between operational and investments costs by employing investment time horizons to reflect the impacts of system operation on transmission investments (T-LRIC method and ToU-LRIC method). 2. differentiating various generation technologies by firstly quantifying their impacts on the time horizons of network investments, then translating these impacts to <b>transmission</b> <b>charges</b> (T-LRIC method and ToU-LRIC method). 3. providing time-specific <b>transmission</b> <b>charges,</b> in which Time-of-Use periods are identified by clustering time-series congestion costs or <b>transmission</b> <b>charges,</b> thus reflecting the typical conditions of system congestions and the required transmission investments (ToU-LRIC method and ToU-ICRP method). The main benefits from introducing these innovations are i) to guide the short-run behaviours of network users, thus mitigating transmission congestions and promoting efficient utilization of existing networks; ii) to incentivize appropriate generation expansion, thus reducing or deferring costly future transmission investments...|$|R

40|$|A key {{intention}} of the regulatory reform of <b>transmission</b> <b>charge</b> schemes on Japan's electric power market was to promote inter-regional competition between power suppliers by lowering long-distance <b>transmission</b> <b>charges</b> with a postage-stamp charge scheme. This can lead to extensive use of inter-regional links and cause congestion. Congestion segments the market into several regional markets, making the reform less successful. We developed a nine-region spatial equilibrium model to simulate the reform at the peak-load hour. We found the reform would lead to significant increases of inter-regional transmission and congestion at {{the link between the}} 50 -Hz area and the 60 -Hz area. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a transmission expansion formulation that maximizes {{the profits of}} the generators in a decentralized market structure. Transmission expansion of congested lines increases the dispatch by the generators and hence the generator surplus. The generators profit is the difference in surplus and the <b>transmission</b> congestion <b>charges.</b> Previous work on profit maximization was a simple quadratic formulation as the <b>transmission</b> <b>charges</b> were taken as fixed investment costs. In this paper, <b>transmission</b> congestion <b>charges</b> {{are based on the}} difference in spot market locational marginal prices. To ensure that transmission merchants always profits from expansion, the <b>transmission</b> congestion <b>charges</b> are modeled as several blocks of congestion prices and transmission capacities. The profitable transmission expansion for generators is thus formulated as a mixed integer (0 - 1) quadratic programming problem. Examples are provided to explain the method...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{generalized}} Nash equilibrium model with two players {{to compare the}} effects of using coincident-peak <b>transmission</b> <b>charges</b> with anytime-peak <b>transmission</b> <b>charges.</b> Players {{are assumed to be}} able to shift load between periods with a cost that grows quadrat-ically with the amount shifted. When the shifting costs are large compared with peak charges, the model has a unique equilibrium. Coincident-peak charging and anytime-peak charging give different outcomes when the peak load for one purchaser does not coincide with the coincident peak. Coincident-peak charges favour purchasers whose peaks do not coincide with the system peak. They are more effective than anytime-peak charges at decreasing peak loads and therefore low-ering peak charges. ...|$|R

Generation expansion planning is decided by strategic generation planners (SGPs) trying to maximize their profits, while transmission line investments are planned by a central planner and regulatory body aimed at minimizing the overall operation and network investment costs of the system. Regulatory <b>transmission</b> <b>charges</b> (RTCs) are calculated according to the marginal responsibility of generation investment on transmission network investment costs.

40|$|Abstract — If <b>transmission</b> <b>charges</b> are {{to reflect}} costs, {{they should be}} {{affected}} by the location of demand and generation. This paper describes the Investment Cost Related Pricing (ICRP) methodology used to calculate <b>transmission</b> <b>charges</b> in Great Britain (GB), which is based on the marginal investment cost of additional demand or generation, using a DC Load Flow transport model. We apply this existing method to calculate charges for the Supergen FutureNet scenarios for 2020. This study highlights the sensitivities in charges for use of the transmission system arising from plausible demand and generation developments. The changes in tariffs will present financial challenges for system users in some areas. The objective of the work presented is to illustrate the sensitivity of the charges produced by this methodology to changes in demand, generation and network topology rather than compare alternative pricing approaches. The conclusion drawn is that the ICRP system pricing method may be suitable in future years but only with some important issues investigated and resolved...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to discuss the role played by the regulation of the transmission system in creating or increasing com-petition in the power industry. In particular, we focus on the e¤ects of the regulation of the <b>transmission</b> <b>charge</b> on the strategy played by generators. We consider a two-node network with limited capacity of interconnection in which the wholesale market is organized through a nodal price system. In this setting, we analyze a linear tari ¤ and a two-part transmission tari ¤ as a mechanism to remunerate the total cost of providing interconnection capacity. We show that the regulation of this charge has two immediate e¤ects. First, it a¤ects the quantity pro-duced at each node and more importantly, it may a¤ect the minimum capacity requirement that support equilibria with or without conges-tion. We show that the ow between nodes has an ambiguous impact when increasing the <b>transmission</b> <b>charge.</b> Finally, we characterize the supply of capacity that it is consistent with a transmission operator who behaves competitively and we introduce some conditions about the optimal transmission capacity...|$|R
