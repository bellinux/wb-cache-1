Jagadesh Kumar and C. L. Reddy Abstract: The authors report a novel method {{to reduce the}} <b>collector–emitter</b> offset <b>voltage</b> of the wide bandgap SiC-P-emitter lateral HBTs using a dual-bandgap emitter. In their approach, the <b>collector–emitter</b> offset <b>voltage</b> VCE(offset) is reduced drastically by eliminating the built-in potential difference between the emitter–base (EB) and collector–base (CB) junctions by using a SiC-on-Si P-emitter. It is demonstrated that the proposed dual-bandgap P-emitter HBT, together with the SiGe base and Schottky collector, not only has a very low VCE(offset) but also exhibits high current gain, reduced Kirk effect, excellent transient response and high cutoff frequency. The performance of the proposed device is evaluated in detail using two-dimensional device simulation, and a possible BiCMOS compatible fabrication procedure is also suggested. ...|$|R

5000|$|Another {{drawback}} of the Darlington pair is its increased [...] "saturation" [...] voltage. The {{output transistor}} {{is not allowed}} to saturate (i.e. its base-collector junction must remain reverse-biased) because the first transistor, when saturated, establishes full (100%) parallel negative feedback between the collector and the base of the second transistor. Since <b>collector-emitter</b> <b>voltage</b> is equal to the sum of its own base-emitter voltage and the <b>collector-emitter</b> <b>voltage</b> of the first transistor, both positive quantities in normal operation, it always exceeds the base-emitter voltage. (In symbols, [...] always.) Thus the [...] "saturation" [...] voltage of a Darlington transistor is one VBE (about 0.65 V in silicon) higher than a single transistor saturation voltage, which is typically 0.1 - 0.2 V in silicon. For equal collector currents, this drawback translates to an increase in the dissipated power for the Darlington transistor over a single transistor. The increased low output level can cause troubles when TTL logic circuits are driven.|$|E
50|$|Some models base the {{collector}} current correction factor on {{the collector}}-base voltage VCB (as described in base-width modulation) {{instead of the}} <b>collector-emitter</b> <b>voltage</b> VCE. Using VCB may be more physically plausible, {{in agreement with the}} physical origin of the effect, which is a widening of the collector-base depletion layer that depends on VCB. Computer models such as those used in SPICE use the collector-base voltage VCB.|$|E

5000|$|The {{operating}} {{point of the}} circuit in this configuration (labelled Q) is generally designed {{to be in the}} active region, approximately {{in the middle of the}} load line for amplifier applications. Adjusting the base current so that the circuit is at this {{operating point}} with no signal applied is called biasing the transistor. Several techniques are used to stabilize the operating point against minor changes in temperature or transistor operating characteristics. When a signal is applied, the base current varies, and the <b>collector-emitter</b> <b>voltage</b> in turn varies, following the load line - the result is an amplifier stage with gain.|$|E
50|$|The {{current is}} still governed by Richardson's law. However, {{in this case}} the barrier height does not depend on We. The barrier height now depends on the work {{function}} of the collector, as well as any additional applied voltages:where Wc is the collector's thermionic work function, ΔVce is the applied <b>collector-emitter</b> <b>voltage,</b> and ΔVS is the Seebeck voltage in the hot emitter (the influence of ΔVS is often omitted, as it is a small contribution of order 10 mV).The resulting current density Jc through the collector (per unit of collector area) is again given by Richardson's Law, except nowwhere A is a Richardson-type constant that depends on the collector material but may also depend on the emitter material, and the diode geometry.In this case, the dependence of Jc on Te, or on ΔVce, can be fitted to yield Wc.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, the {{collector}} current in a bipolar transistor for low and moderate emitter currents conforms {{closely to the}} relation [...] where [...] is the thermal voltage and [...] is a constant dependent on temperature, doping concentrations, and <b>collector-emitter</b> <b>voltage.</b> [...] Matched currents in transistors Q1 and Q2 depend on conformity to the same equation but observed mismatches in [...] are geometry dependent and range from [...] percent. Such differences between Q1 and Q2 lead directly to static errors of the same percentage for the entire mirror. Careful layout and transistor design must be used to minimize this source of error. For example, Q1 and Q2 may each be implemented {{as a pair of}} paralleled transistors arranged as a cross-coupled quad in a common-centric layout to reduce effects of local gradients in current gain. If the mirror is to be used at a fixed bias level, matching resistors in the emitters of this pair can transfer some of the matching problem from the transistors to those resistors.|$|E
5000|$|Secondary {{breakdown}} is {{a failure}} mode in bipolar power transistors. In a power transistor with a large junction area, under certain conditions of current and voltage, the current concentrates in a small spot of the base-emitter junction. This causes local heating, progressing into a short between collector and emitter. This often leads {{to the destruction of}} the transistor. Secondary breakdown can occur both with forward and reverse base drive. Except at low <b>collector-emitter</b> <b>voltages,</b> the secondary breakdown limit restricts the collector current more than the steady-state power dissipation of the device. Power MOSFETs do not exhibit secondary breakdown, and their safe operating area is limited only by maximum current (the capacity of the bonding wires), maximum power dissipation and maximum voltage. [...] However, Power MOSFETs have parasitic PN and BJT elements within the structure, which can cause more complex localized failure modes resembling Secondary Breakdown.|$|R

5000|$|With {{two or more}} base {{resistors}} (R3 and R4) {{instead of}} one, the inverter becomes a two-input RTL NOR gate (see the figure on the right). The logical operation OR is performed by applying consecutively the two arithmetic operations addition and comparison (the input resistor network acts as a parallel voltage summer with equally weighted inputs and the following common-emitter transistor stage as a voltage comparator with a threshold about 0.7 V). The equivalent resistance of all the resistors connected to logical [...] "1" [...] and the equivalent resistance of all the resistors connected to logical [...] "0" [...] form the two legs of a composed voltage divider driving the transistor. The base resistances {{and the number of}} the inputs are chosen (limited) so that only one logical [...] "1" [...] is sufficient to create base-emitter voltage exceeding the threshold and, as a result, saturating the transistor. If all the input voltages are low (logical [...] "0"), the transistor is cut-off. The pull-down resistor R1 biases the transistor to the appropriate on-off threshold. The output is inverted since the <b>collector-emitter</b> <b>voltage</b> of transistor Q1 is taken as output, and is high when the inputs are low.

40|$|Insulated gate bipolar {{transistors}} (IGBTs) are the devices {{of choice for}} medium and high power, low frequency applications. IGBTs {{have been reported to}} fail under excessive electrical and thermal stresses in variable speed drives and are considered as reliability problems in wind turbines, inverters in hybrid electric vehicles and railway traction motors. There is a need to develop methods to detect anomalous behavior and predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of IGBTs to prevent system downtime and costly failures. In this study, a framework for prognostics of IGBTs was developed to provide early warnings of failure and predict the remaining useful life. The prognostic framework was implemented on non punch through (NPT) IGBTs. Power cycling of IGBTs was performed and the gate-emitter voltage, <b>collector-emitter</b> <b>voltage,</b> collector-emitter current and case temperature was monitored in-situ during aging. The on-state collector-emitter current (ICE(ON)) and <b>collector-emitter</b> <b>voltage</b> (VCE(ON)) were identified as precursors to IGBT failure.
