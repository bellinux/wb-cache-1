5|$|The Ilyushin Il-6 was a Soviet {{long-range}} bomber {{developed from}} the Ilyushin Il-4 during 1942. Originally intended as a high-speed replacement for the Il-4, it was recast as a very long-range bomber with fuel-conserving diesel engines before production of the single prototype began in December 1942. Flight testing showed <b>controllability</b> issues when landing at high weights and the engines proved {{to be hard to}} start at low temperatures and were slow to respond to throttle movements. Further development was canceled in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Flight tests {{revealed}} difficult handling, {{and a lack}} of power due to the non-availability of the intended ACh-30BF engines. Flight tests continued without the waist guns and their gunner until the ACh-30BF's were fitted between May and July 1944. Despite modifications, the aircraft still suffered from poor <b>controllability</b> at low speeds and high weights as well as very poor gliding performance. Throughout the flight tests the engines performed satisfactorily in the air, but were found {{to be very difficult to}} start in low ambient temperatures and had slow response to throttle movements. Further development was canceled.|$|E
5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} weighs 6.0grams (93grains)—roughly {{half as much}} as {{a typical}} 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge—making extra ammunition less burdensome, or allowing more ammunition to be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm cartridge also has a relatively small diameter, a relatively high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine. The cartridge has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash (when fired from a pistol), but it has roughly 30 percent less recoil than the 9×19mm cartridge, improving <b>controllability.</b> Due to its high velocity, the 5.7×28mm also exhibits an exceptionally flat trajectory.|$|E
5|$|First {{deliveries}} {{began in}} March 1947 and a flight test program began that month that lasted {{three years before}} the major deficiencies identified were fully corrected. Carrier landing trials revealed a structural weakness of the rear fuselage when one aircraft was severed in half during a heavy landing. Severe vibrations in the tail upon engaging the arresting wire were cured by adding a roller bearing to the tailhook to counter the sideways forces placed on the tailhook. Other necessary changes were the addition of spoiler ailerons and an elevator control boost to improve the aircraft's poor <b>controllability</b> at low speeds. In addition, the cockpit layout was unsatisfactory {{and had to be}} redesigned. The NATC finally deemed the Mauler acceptable for carrier landings in August 1948 even though aircraft had been issued to one squadron earlier in the year and a new batch of 50 aircraft had been ordered in May. Despite all the modifications to the aircraft over its short life, it remained a maintenance nightmare, especially the leaky hydraulic systems.|$|E
5|$|From 1945 onwards, Britain {{conducted}} {{a number of}} studies into the properties and use of variable geometry wings. The noted British engineer and inventor Sir Barnes Wallis began exploring the concept during the Second World War and became an early pioneer and advocate for the variable geometry wing, conceiving of an aircraft consideration that lacked conventional features such as a vertical stabiliser and rudder, instead using variable geometry wings to provide primary <b>controllability</b> in their place. In 1946, Wallis published a paper upon this research, which was quickly hailed as being a major scientific breakthrough in the aviation industry. Wallis proceeded to advocate for the production of an aircraft, military or civil, that would take advantage of a variable geometry wing. The Ministry of Supply and Ministry of Defence arranged for a series of tests to demonstrate the application of the technology to projectiles, both for research purposes and a potential form of anti-aircraft defence; while Wallis worked upon this research programme, he continued to promote the concept of a manned variable geometry aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{significant}} {{to the design}} of the P90 is the small-caliber, high-velocity bottlenecked cartridge it uses. The 5.7×28mm cartridge was created by FN Herstal in response to a NATO requirement that called for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge, which is commonly used in pistols and submachine guns. The 5.7×28mm cartridge weighs 6.0g (93grains)—roughly half as much as a typical 9×19mm cartridge—allowing the same number of rounds to be carried for less weight, or allowing more rounds to be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm cartridge has a relatively small diameter, an unusually high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine. The cartridge has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash (when fired from a pistol), but it produces roughly 30percent less recoil than the 9×19mm cartridge, improving <b>controllability.</b> Due to its high velocity, the 5.7×28mm exhibits an exceptionally flat trajectory.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the <b>controllability</b> of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Observability is {{a measure}} for how well {{internal}} states of a system can be inferred by knowledge of its external outputs. The observability and <b>controllability</b> of a system are mathematical duals (i.e., as <b>controllability</b> provides that an input is available that brings any initial state to any desired final state, observability provides that knowing an output trajectory provides enough information to predict the initial state of the system).|$|E
25|$|In August 2017, {{the first}} {{prototype}} performed nine test flights, analysing stability and <b>controllability</b> in various configurations, altitude, altitude/speed sensors accuracy and engine operation.|$|E
25|$|A backup project {{prepared}} while plants producing AM-35/AM-38 were evacuated. Trials {{demonstrated that}} with the fighter engine, low-altitude performance and <b>controllability</b> were unacceptable.|$|E
25|$|Some remarks {{concerning}} <b>controllability.</b> Contributions {{to modern}} {{calculus of variations}} (Bologna, 1985), 184—188, Pitman Res. Notes Math. Ser., 148, Longman Sci. Tech., Harlow, 1987.|$|E
25|$|Fitted with {{retractable}} auxiliary {{wing flaps}} enabling a wing loading of around 12.5lb per square foot, the Messenger featured triple fins and rudders {{in order to}} maintain sufficient <b>controllability</b> down to the exceptionally low stalling speed of 25mph.|$|E
25|$|By 1922 Henry {{founded the}} Berliner Aircraft Company {{with a focus}} on {{conventional}} aircraft. The Berliner Helicopter was successfully demonstrated throughout the 1920s but interest was lost due to its limited <b>controllability</b> and engine-out abilities compared to the autogyro and conventional aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Various {{other types}} of {{converter}} have been proposed, combining features of the two-level and Modular Multi-Level Converters. These hybrid VSC systems aim to achieve the low losses and high harmonic performance of the MMC with a more compact design and greater <b>controllability,</b> but these concepts are still at the research stage.|$|E
25|$|In {{the modern}} world, silicon diodes {{are the most}} widely used {{rectifiers}} for lower voltages and powers, and have largely replaced earlier germanium diodes. For very high voltages and powers, the added need for <b>controllability</b> has in practice led to replacing simple silicon diodes with high-power thyristors (see below) and their newer actively gate-controlled cousins.|$|E
25|$|<b>Controllability</b> and {{observability}} are main {{issues in}} the analysis of a system before deciding the best control strategy to be applied, or whether it is even possible to control or stabilize the system. <b>Controllability</b> is related to the possibility of forcing the system into a particular state by using an appropriate control signal. If a state is not controllable, then no signal {{will ever be able to}} control the state. If a state is not controllable, but its dynamics are stable, then the state is termed stabilizable. Observability instead is related to the possibility of observing, through output measurements, the state of a system. If a state is not observable, the controller will never be able to determine the behavior of an unobservable state and hence cannot use it to stabilize the system. However, similar to the stabilizability condition above, if a state cannot be observed it might still be detectable.|$|E
25|$|Process <b>controllability</b> - Unlike a {{traditional}} gas furnace the induction system requires no pre-heat cycle or controlled shutdown. The heat {{is available on}} demand. In addition to the benefits of rapid availability {{in the event of}} a downstream interruption to production the power can be switched off thus saving energy and reducing scaling on the components.|$|E
25|$|Failure of {{a single}} inboard engine, from a set of four, has a much smaller effect on <b>controllability.</b> This is because an inboard engine {{is closer to the}} aircraft's centre of gravity, so the lack of yawing moment is decreased. In this situation, if speed is {{maintained}} at or above the published VMCA, as determined for the critical engine, safe control can be maintained.|$|E
25|$|In {{conjunction}} with Parker Hannifin, MPC Products of Skokie, Illinois designed a fly-by-wire technology mechanical control suite for the 717 flight deck. The modules replaced much cumbersome rigging {{that had occurred}} in previous DC-9/MD-80 aircraft. The Rolls-Royce BR715 engines are completely controlled by an electronic engine system (FADEC— Full Authority Digital Engine Control) developed by BAE Systems, offering improved <b>controllability</b> and optimization. The engine has significantly lower fuel consumption compared to other engines of the equivalent amount of thrust.|$|E
25|$|In a 1979 {{interview}} about general aviation's future past the year 2000, Weick accurately envisioned the continued interest in sport aviation and the practical use of aircraft for medium-range transportation. He {{mentioned that he}} had seen gas turbines demonstrated as early as 1922, and that their future use in light aircraft would only be viable with development of cost-efficient materials that could withstand the heat. He felt future aircraft would not be radically different, but could benefit from safety improvements in <b>controllability.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Be-200 is a high-wing T-tail monoplane. {{the hull}} is of single step design {{with a high}} length-to-beam ratio, which {{contributes}} to stability and <b>controllability</b> in water. The Be-200 airframe is constructed of aluminium alloys with corrosion-protection treatments. Selective use is made of titanium, composites and other corrosion-free materials. The wings are fitted with underwing stabiliser floats. The hydraulically operated retractable landing gear units all retract rearward, and each unit is twin-wheeled. A water rudder provides steering in the water.|$|E
25|$|Dunne had {{obtained}} a War Office order for two D.8s, though one was cancelled because of late delivery. The other {{was delivered to}} Farnborough on 3 March 1914, where it was given the RFC number 366. It made several flights on 11 March piloted by N. S. Percival, who had flown the first D.8 many times at Eastchurch and was now an RFC officer. The general judgement {{was that in the}} search for balance between stability and <b>controllability,</b> the Dunne design overemphasised the former.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{hydraulically-operated}} triangular {{air brakes}} were {{installed on the}} rear fuselage, which worked in addition with the existing 'finger'-type brakes installed in the wings; the new brakes gave the pilots a greater level of <b>controllability,</b> improving the accuracy of low-level bombing runs. The B-57B was equipped with an APW-11 Bombing Air Radar Guidance System for target approach guidance, {{as well as a}} APS-54 radar warning receiver. The engines were also furnished with a new cartridge starting system, eliminating the reliance on ground start carts.|$|E
25|$|The Bizon uses {{a simple}} {{straight}} blowback method of operation, an unlocked breech system reduces cost and build complexity. The Bizon's operating cycle {{is characterized by}} a very short recoil stroke, standard 9×18mm ammunition will only drive the bolt partially {{to the rear of the}} receiver and produces a cyclic rate of 700 rounds/min. High-impulse ammunition forces the bolt to travel all the way to the end of the receiver, barely striking the receiver wall. A rate of fire of 650–680 rounds/min is the result. This has the effect of reducing perceived recoil and increasing <b>controllability</b> and hit probability.|$|E
25|$|The ESC {{system uses}} several sensors to {{determine}} what the driver wants (input). Other sensors indicate the actual {{state of the vehicle}} (response). The control algorithm compares driver input to vehicle response and decides, when necessary, to apply brakes and/or reduce throttle by the amounts calculated through the state space (set of equations used to model the dynamics of the vehicle). The ESC controller can also receive data from and issue commands to other controllers on the vehicle such as an all wheel drive system or an active suspension system to improve vehicle stability and <b>controllability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Materials {{that have}} been used to make {{biologic}} tubes include blood vessels and skeletal muscles, while nonabsorbable and bioabsorbable synthetic tubes have been made from silicone and polyglycolide respectively. Tissue-engineered nerve guidance conduits are a combination of many elements: scaffold structure, scaffold material, cellular therapies, neurotrophic factors and biomimetic materials. The choice of which physical, chemical and biological cues to use is based on the properties of the nerve environment, which is critical in creating the most desirable environment for axon regeneration. The factors that control material selection include biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical integrity, <b>controllability</b> during nerve growth, implantation and sterilization.|$|E
25|$|Significant to {{the history}} of both {{approaches}} are the contributions made by Bernard Weiner in the 1970s. Before this time, attribution theorists and locus of control theorists had been largely concerned with divisions into external and internal loci of causality. Weiner added the dimension of stability-instability (and later <b>controllability),</b> indicating how a cause could be perceived as having been internal to a person yet still beyond the person's control. The stability dimension added to the understanding of why people succeed or fail after such outcomes. Although not part of Weiner's model, a further dimension of attribution, that of globality-specificity, was added by Abramson, Seligman and Teasdale.|$|E
25|$|Tanker 910 {{experienced}} {{its first}} serious aviation incident on June 25, 2007. While on its third run over the White Fire in the Kern County mountains near Tehachapi, California, the aircraft {{was in a}} left bank while turning from base to final approach. It encountered sinking air, the left wing dropped, and the aircraft descended 100 to 200 feet lower than expected. The left wing struck several trees before pilots were able to power out of the descent. The aircraft climbed to altitude for a <b>controllability</b> check and to dump its load of retardant, then returned to its base in Victorville, where it made an emergency landing and was grounded pending an investigation, inspection, and repairs.|$|E
25|$|The AW119 is a {{single-engine}} multirole helicopter, AgustaWestland {{promote the}} type as possessing excellent flight qualities {{with high levels}} of <b>controllability,</b> maneuverability and inherent safety. The design of the rotorcraft is derived from Agusta's earlier and highly successful A109 helicopter, differing primarily by only being equipped with a single engine (as the A109 was originally designed), a Pratt & Whitney PT6B-37A turboshaft engine, and using fixed skids in place of the A109's retractable wheeled landing gear arrangement. The AW119 shares the same cockpit and cabin of the AW109, along with commonality with various other systems, while costing roughly half of the latter's price tag. According to Flight International, the AW119 is competitively priced and provides good levels of accessibility, maintainability, comfort, noise levels, and speed.|$|E
25|$|October 25, 1999 – San Jose Police Department McDonnell Douglas 500N {{helicopter}} N904PD {{lost control}} while entering the traffic pattern at SJC during a maintenance ferry flight. The helicopter crashed onto The Alameda, near highway 880, killing a San Jose Police Officer/pilot, Desmond Casey, and the helicopter's mechanic, {{who were on}} board. There were no reported damage or injuries on the ground. The NTSB determined that temporary repairs made in order to ferry the helicopter back to SJC, actually made the <b>controllability</b> problem that {{was intended to be}} solved, worse. Pilot manuals and training for the NOTAR (no tail rotor) helicopter did not provide adequate preparation for the pilot, who was experienced in conventional helicopters, to recover from a stuck thruster condition which occurred.|$|E
25|$|During flight testing, the snag on {{the leading}} edge of the stabilators was filled in, and the gap between the leading-edge {{extensions}} (LEX) and the fuselage mostly filled in. The gaps, called the boundary layer air discharge (BLAD) slots, controlled the vortices generated by the LEX and presented clean air to the vertical stabilizers at high angles of attack, but they also generated a great deal of parasitic drag, worsening the problem of the F/A-18's inadequate range. McDonnell filled in 80% of the gap, leaving a small slot to bleed air from the engine intake. This may have contributed to early problems with fatigue cracks appearing on the vertical stabilizers due to extreme Structural loads, resulting in a short grounding in 1984 until the stabilizers were strengthened. Starting in May 1988, a small vertical fence was added to the top of each LEX to broaden the vortices and direct them away from the vertical stabilizers. This also provided a minor increase in <b>controllability</b> as a side effect. F/A-18s of early versions had a problem with insufficient rate of roll, exacerbated by the insufficient wing stiffness, especially with heavy underwing ordnance loads.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used membrane is Nafion by Chemours, which relies on liquid water humidification of the membrane to transport protons. This implies {{that it is not}} feasible to use temperatures above 80 to 90°C, since the membrane would dry. Other, more recent membrane types, based on polybenzimidazole (PBI) or phosphoric acid, can reach up to 220°C without using any water management: higher temperature allow for better efficiencies, power densities, ease of cooling (because of larger allowable temperature differences), reduced sensitivity to carbon monoxide poisoning and better <b>controllability</b> (because of absence of water management issues in the membrane); however, these recent types are not as common. PBI can be doped with phosphoric or sulfuric acid and the conductivity scales with amount of doping and temperature. At high temperatures, it is difficult to keep Nafion hydrated, but this acid doped material does not use water as a medium for proton conduction. It also exhibits better mechanical properties, higher strength, than Nafion and is cheaper. However, acid leaching is a considerable issue and processing, mixing with catalyst to form ink, has proved tricky. Aromatic polymers, such as PEEK, are far cheaper than Teflon (PTFE and backbone of Nafion) and their polar character leads to hydration that is less temperature dependent than Nafion. However, PEEK is far less ionically conductive than Nafion and thus is a less favorable electrolyte choice. Recently, protic ionic liquids and protic organic ionic plastic crystals have been shown as promising alternative electrolyte materials for high temperature (100–200°C) PEMFCs.|$|E
500|$|Belevitch {{played a}} part in {{developing}} a mathematical test for determining the <b>controllability</b> of linear control systems. [...] A system is controllable if it can be moved from one state to another through the system state space in a finite time by application of control inputs. [...] This test is known as the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus, or PBH, test. [...] There is also a PBH test for determining the observability of a system – that is, the ability to determine the state of a system in finite time solely from the system's own outputs.Kisačanin and Agarwal, pp.50-58 ...|$|E
500|$|Voss {{and the six}} {{remaining}} British aces swirled down to 600meters (2,000feet). At times, Voss had {{the altitude}} advantage over his foes, but {{did not try to}} escape the fight. Using the triplane's superior rate of climb and its ability to slip turn, Voss managed to evade his opponents and return to battle. He continued to flick turn at high speeds and attack those behind him. As Bowman later noted concerning his only shot at Voss: [...] "'To my amazement he kicked on full rudder, without bank, pulled his nose up slightly, gave me a burst while he was skidding sideways and then kicked on opposite rudder before the results of this amazing stunt appeared to have any effect on the <b>controllability</b> of his machine." [...] Bowman's machine was left slowed and ineffectively trailing dark smoke and steam, though he stayed in the fight.|$|E
500|$|The Tetrarchs {{remained}} in Britain, {{and would probably}} have been used as training vehicles before being retired from service, but on 22 June 1941 the German invasion of the USSR, Operation Barbarossa began, and the USSR became an ally of Britain. The Lend-Lease program, begun in March 1941 by the United States of America to supply defensive materials to Britain and China, was therefore extended to the USSR. As part of the program, the British government began supplying war materials to the USSR, which in early 1942, included a shipment of 20 Tetrarchs, {{as well as a number}} of Valentine and Matilda Mk I Infantry tanks. [...] The Soviet military utilised a greater number of light tanks than the British, and so could use the Tetrarchs. When the tanks arrived in the USSR, however, it was apparent that the design problems with the cooling system were also present in cold conditions; additionally, [...] the cold weather had a deleterious effect on the tank's suspension and tracks. Additional testing of [...] the Tetrarchs was conducted by the Soviet military [...] and the design was admired for its <b>controllability,</b> manoeuvrability, and speed, as well its ability to run on low-quality fuel, unlike contemporary Soviet designs. The thinness of the Tetrarch's armour was found to be a problem and one which could not be solved, as the weight of extra armour plating caused an unacceptable reduction in the tank's speed. Despite these drawbacks [...] in the Tetrarch's design, Soviet authorities believed it to be comparable to the T-70 light tank in use at the time, and decided that it was suitable to be used in combat. A number of Tetrarchs were sent to Tank Training Schools which were subsequently sent into battle, and in September 1943 two were assigned to the 132nd Separated Tank Battalion, which was attached to the 5th Guards Tank Brigade; both tanks were destroyed in combat, one on 30 September and the other on 2 October, the latter a casualty of artillery fire. Several were also used for propaganda purposes, appearing in photographs of Soviet troops who were fighting in the Caucasus region.|$|E
