60|$|Men {{have all}} sorts of motives which carry them onwards in life, and are driven into acts of desperation, or it may be of distinction, from a hundred {{different}} causes. There was one comrade of Esmond's, an honest little Irish lieutenant of Handyside's, who owed so much money to a camp sutler, that he began to make love to the man's daughter, intending to pay his debt that way; and at the battle of Malplaquet, flying away from the debt and lady too, he rushed so desperately on the French lines, that he got his company; and came a captain out of the action, and had to marry the sutler's daughter after all, who brought him his <b>cancelled</b> <b>debt</b> to her father as poor Roger's fortune. To run {{out of the reach of}} bill and marriage, he ran on the enemy's pikes; and as these did not kill him he was thrown back upon t'other horn of his dilemma. Our great Duke at the same battle was fighting, not the French, but the Tories in England; and risking his life and the army's, not for his country but for his pay and places; and for fear of his wife at home, that only being in life whom he dreaded. I have asked about men in my own company, (new drafts of poor country boys were perpetually coming over to us during the wars, and brought from the ploughshare to the sword,) and found that a half of them under the flags were driven thither on account of a woman: one fellow was jilted by his mistress and took the shilling in despair; another jilted the girl, and fled from her and the parish to the tents where the law could not disturb him. Why go on particularizing? What can the sons of Adam and Eve expect, but to continue in that course of love and trouble their father and mother set out on? Oh, my grandson! I am drawing nigh to the end of that period of my history, when I was acquainted with the great world of England and Europe; my years are past the Hebrew poet's limit, and I say unto thee, all my troubles and joys too, for that matter, have come from a woman; as thine will when thy destined course begins. 'Twas a woman that made a soldier of me, that set me intriguing afterwards; I believe I would have spun smocks for her had she so bidden me; what strength I had in my head I would have given her; hath not every man in his degree had his Omphale and Delilah? Mine befooled me on the banks of the Thames, and in dear old England; thou mayest find thine own by Rappahannock.|$|E

50|$|Once {{the lender}} writes off the debt, it will report the amount to the IRS. Homeowners {{should expect to}} receive Form 1099-C showing the <b>canceled</b> <b>debt</b> amount.|$|R
50|$|Generally, any {{creditor}} <b>canceling</b> <b>debt</b> of $600.00 or more {{is required}} to file Form 1099-C by January 31 {{of the next year}} following the date when the <b>debt</b> was <b>canceled.</b>|$|R
50|$|Insolvency: If {{a person}} is {{insolvent}} and his/her debt is cancelled, then a certain amount or the entire <b>cancelled</b> <b>debt</b> may not be taxed. This is because that person is insolvent as his/her overall debts exceed the fair market value of his/her assets.|$|E
5000|$|Some farm debts - If your {{source of}} income {{for the past three years}} was through farming and you’ve {{incurred}} debt due to its direct operation, and the lender is an agency or a person who is a regular lender, then your <b>cancelled</b> <b>debt</b> will not attract any taxes.|$|E
5000|$|Insolvency - A {{borrower}} whose {{mortgage debt}} has been forgiven, but remains an insolvent, then that person {{may not be}} obligated {{to pay taxes on}} {{all or part of the}} <b>cancelled</b> <b>debt.</b> Insolvency will only be considered when the borrower’s total debt exceeds the market value of his/her assets.|$|E
50|$|Failure to file Form 1099-C may {{subject the}} {{taxpayer}} to civil penalties, but such penalties are relatively minor, and rarely exceed $150.00 per form. There is no exemption from the filing requirement if <b>canceled</b> <b>debt</b> {{in excess of}} $600.00 is recognized.|$|R
50|$|The Circumcellions were fanatical {{bands of}} predatory peasants that flourished in North Africa in the 4th century. At first they were {{concerned}} with remedying social grievances, but they became linked with the Donatist sect. They condemned property and slavery, and advocated <b>canceling</b> <b>debts</b> and freeing slaves.|$|R
5000|$|Debt {{forgiveness}} {{was also}} found in Ancient Athens, where in the 6th century BCE, the lawmaker Solon instituted a set of laws called seisachtheia, and which <b>canceled</b> all <b>debts</b> and retroactively <b>canceled</b> previous <b>debts</b> that had caused slavery and serfdom, freeing debt slaves and debt serfs.|$|R
50|$|After these victories, Cleomenes {{returned}} to Sparta and began radical reforms. He abolished the ephors, changed land laws, <b>cancelled</b> <b>debt</b> {{and he also}} changed his army {{into one of the}} Macedonian style. Following these reforms, Cleomenes with his reformed army answered to appeals from the city of Mantinea and after ridding it of its Achaean garrison advanced north into the Achaean heartland.|$|E
5000|$|Non-recourse loans - In case of non-recourse loans, lenders repossess the {{property}} signed as collateral by the borrower, as a remedy {{to resolve the}} loan repayment default. However, lenders are barred from pursuing their borrowers for the repayment of the loan money, {{in the event of}} a default. Once a property has been foreclosed, the forgiven non-recourse loan will not be considered as <b>cancelled</b> <b>debt.</b> But, that may attract other taxes.|$|E
50|$|If you’ve {{borrowed}} money and your lender cancels/terminates or forgives the outstanding loan balance owed {{to you at}} a later stage, then you, as per the Internal Revenue Service will be liable to file an income tax return on the forgiven debt amount {{with respect to the}} corresponding situations. At the time of loan origination, the loan money that you received weren’t considered as an income because you made an agreement to pay back the borrowed sum to the lender, i.e., it was your obligation to repay the loan amount as per the signed contract’s terms and conditions. However, when your obligation to pay back the borrowed sum has been ‘cancelled’ or forgiven, then the payable debt amount becomes reportable as income. The simple reason for it is that you are no longer obligated to repay the loan to the lender. Meanwhile, it is the lender who has to report the <b>cancelled</b> <b>debt</b> to the IRS as well as to you using Form 1099-C, better known as “Cancellation of Debt”.|$|E
50|$|When <b>debt</b> is <b>cancelled,</b> {{then that}} {{symmetry}} is destroyed. The borrower {{is now in}} a better position than if the loan was fully repaid.

5000|$|Although Field {{had many}} {{available}} career options, he chose business. At first, {{he worked for}} his brothers, David Dudley Field, Jr., and Matthew Dickinson Field. In 1838, he accepted an offer from his brother Matthew to become his assistant in the paper manufacturing venture, the Columbia Mill, in Lee, Massachusetts. In Spring 1840, he went into business by himself, manufacturing paper in Westfield, Massachusetts. The same year, he became a junior partner in the E. Root & Co., a wholesale paper firm based in New York with responsibilities to oversee clients and conduct sales away from New York. After six months, E. Root & Co. failed leaving large debts.citation needed Field negotiated with creditors, dissolved the old firm, and started a new partnership with his brother-in-law, Joseph F. Stone, registered as Cyrus W. Field & Co. He stayed in business and was furnishing supplies for the Northeast mills, such as owned by Crane & Company, and buying the finished product wholesale. Through his hard work and long hours, the young paper merchant was able to repay the settled debts and succeed in business by servicing the burgeoning penny press {{and the need for}} stocks and bonds, becoming eventually one of the richest men in New York. In March, 1853, he repaid all previously <b>cancelled</b> <b>debt</b> due to insolvency of E. Root & Co. debts in full amount with interest, being under no legal obligation to do so. Among the answers received, one particularly stated, [...] Your only inheritance was a load of debt, cast upon you at the commencement of your business life, which was not caused by lack of foresight or fault on your part. You bore up under this heavy burden and paid it as not one in thousands could or would have done, and by this very act you laid broad the basis of your subsequent success.|$|E
40|$|The {{perceived}} lack of conclusive quantitative {{evidence on}} the macroeconomic effects of debt relief in low-income countries has generally blurred the image of debt relief efforts and left the issues of its effectiveness and efficiency open to debate and dispute. This thesis seeks to shed more light on the subject by providing some further empirical evidence. This objective is achieved by performing an empirical investigation of two effects of debt relief. First, the study examines the debt relief-new borrowing relationship in a multivariable regression framework. The results that emerge suggest that, on average, debt relief can be beneficial in reducing the future new borrowing of Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs). This conclusion, to some extent, {{is in line with}} the goals of HIPCs debt relief initiatives in reducing external debt burdens of those countries to sustainable levels. However, it presents a challenge to the views of William Easterly on the ‘perverse incentive effects’ of ‘continuing waves’ of debt relief that are said to lead to further debt accumulation of a similar magnitude to replace old <b>cancelled</b> <b>debt.</b> Second, the analysis explores the influence of debt relief on domestic investment behaviour in developing countries. Debt relief is found to {{have a positive effect on}} domestic investment in countries with good policy environments. This result suggests that debt relief would be more effective in promoting domestic investment if it were more cautiously conditioned on sound policy frameworks...|$|E
40|$|More {{than three-quarters}} of a century after the Supreme Court’s {{decision}} in United States v. Kirby Lumber established that the cancellation of a debt produces taxable income, there is still uncertainty - both in the courts and among commentators - concerning {{the rationale for the}} taxation of cancellation-of-debt (COD) income. Is the taxation of COD income based on the simple fact that the cancellation of a debt improves the taxpayer’s balance sheet, thus increasing the taxpayer’s net worth in the year of cancellation? Or is it based on a multi-year perspective, in which inclusion of the <b>cancelled</b> <b>debt</b> in income is necessary because the overall transaction - consisting of the creation of the debt in one year and the cancellation of it in another - produces an economic gain for the taxpayer? The choice between the rationales is crucial in a significant number of cases involving no-benefit debts. In a no-benefit debt cancellation situation, the taxpayer received nothing of value when the debt was created. This article examines the theoretical underpinnings of the taxation of COD income, and concludes that the whole-transaction analysis should be recognized as the only rationale for the taxation of COD income, with the result that COD income should not follow from the cancellation of a no benefit debt. The article also analyzes nine fact patterns in which a taxpayer at least arguably received nothing of value when the debt was incurred, so that the cancellation of the debt should not produce COD income. The consideration of one of these categories - cancellations of obligations to pay accrued nondeductible interest - is particularly timely, because of the prospect that hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of taxpayers may soon be relieved of obligations to pay accrued credit card interest. Another of these categories - the cancellation of gambling debts - involves one of the most controversial, and most commented-on, tax cases of recent decades...|$|E

5000|$|However, the IRS {{does not}} require taxpayers to report forgiven debt if the tax payer was {{insolvent}} {{at the time the}} creditor forgave the debt.
