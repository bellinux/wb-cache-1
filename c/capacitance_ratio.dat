30|$|For all {{the samples}} studied, the {{capacitance}} either stayed statistically {{the same or}} increased, suggesting that the dealloying procedure either did not change the effective surface area of the sample or caused it to increase. For the samples with between 3 % and 15 % Cu removed, the <b>capacitance</b> <b>ratio</b> decreases {{as the amount of}} copper removed increases. This observation is consistent with the SEM images in Figures 3 and 4. The samples with larger initial copper content tended to have rougher initial topography, such as that in Figure 3 e, and thus had higher initial capacitance measurements. In addition, those samples tended to have larger pits seen in the post-dealloy topography, such as in Figure 3 f, which increased the measured capacitance only modestly. For the samples with smaller amounts of copper removed, there is more variation in the resulting <b>capacitance</b> <b>ratio.</b> The largest increases in capacitance occurred for samples with a moderate initial copper content combined {{with a small amount of}} copper removal, resulting in numerous small pits in the post-dealloy topography.

The volume fractions obtained from the simulation agreed with the input values for the SLM microstructure but differed for the encased model.

40|$|Abstract—In a {{conventional}} parallel plate MEMS variable capacitor, the capacitance versus voltage response (C-V response) has been deterministic. In this work, the C-V response is tuned versatilely {{through the application}} of a control voltage to an additional electrode in order that the initial gap between the parallel capacitor plates is set by the control voltage. Then, the capacitor plates are lifted (capacitance decreases) as the actuation voltage applied to the levering actuator increases. In this manner, the shape of the C-V response can be controlled even after the device is fabricated. At a zero control voltage, the fabricated MEMS variable capacitor exhibited a convex shape in the C-V response (i. e. the capacitance decreases slowly in the low actuation voltage region and rapidly in the high actuation voltage region). When 3 V was applied to the control voltage, the capacitor exhibited an almost linear C-V response with a linearity factor of 0. 999. At 5 V of control voltage, the C-V response changed to a relatively concave shape (i. e. the capacitance decreases rapidly in the low actuation voltage region and slowly in the high actuation voltage region).
