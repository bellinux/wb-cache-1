3000|$|In {{addition}} to the individual skill scores, the PIAAC data set provides information on hourly wages 15 of employed persons. Table  5 shows the dispersion of numeracy test score results, wages, and years of schooling 16 measured by the coefficient of variation. This data already shows {{that there is no}} clear empirical relationship across countries between wage dispersion and numeracy skill dispersion. <b>Countries</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest dispersions of numeracy test scores are the USA, France, Canada, and the UK, whereas <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lowest dispersions are Japan, the Netherlands, and Finland. In terms of wage inequality, <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest wage dispersion are Japan, the USA, and the UK, and <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lowest wage dispersions are Belgium, Norway, Denmark, and Finland. If there was a strong link between skill dispersion and wage dispersion, the data would be expected to show that <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest skill dispersions exhibit the highest wage dispersion and vice versa; this is not always the case here. Additional analysis also shows that the same conclusions hold when wage inequality between different population subgroups is observed. In all the population subgroups examined (men, women, immigrants, non-immigrants, different age subgroups), <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest wage dispersions are still Japan and the USA, and <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lowest wage dispersions are Belgium and the Scandinavian countries (ranking of the countries remains intact). 17 [...]...|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} September 1940, the Tripartite Pact united Japan, Italy and Germany to formalise the Axis Powers.

The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact. Romania would make a major contribution (as did Hungary) to the Axis war against the USSR, partially to recapture territory ceded to the USSR, partially to pursue its leader Ion Antonescu's desire to combat communism.|$|E

5|$|From January 1995, the {{frequency}} between Steinkjer and Melhus was increased slightly. On 26 September 1995, {{the train station}} in Trondheim reopened as a renovated station that serves both buses, coaches and trains. The investment cost NOK50 million. In 1997, NSB stated that the Trøndelag Commuter Rail was unprofitable and threatened to terminate it, along {{with an array of}} other services, if funding was not increased. The same year, 750,000 people traveled with the commuter rail. The 20% increase that year was in part due to the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1997 being held in Trondheim, and was the service in the <b>country</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> largest growth.|$|E

5|$|It is {{uncertain}} as to exactly why John emigrated to Serbia instead of assuming a high-ranking position in Bulgaria, as his ancestry and family ties would suggest.
