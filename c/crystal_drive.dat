We also discuss the difference between the use of LG equation for the statics and the dynamics.

It is demonstrated experimentally that a two-dimensional wet granular <b>crystal</b> <b>driven</b> far from thermal equilibrium melts from its free surface, preceded by an amorphous state. The transition into the surface melting state, as revealed by the bond orientational order parameters, behaves like a first order phase transition, with a threshold being traceable to the rupture energy of a single capillary bridge.

40|$|A {{generalized}} {{version of}} the Lindemann melting criterion has recently been used to develop a unified thermodynamic description of disorder-induced amorphization and heat-induced melting. This concept of amorphization as a melting process {{is based on the}} fact that the melting temperature of a defective <b>crystal</b> <b>driven</b> far from equilibrium will decrease relative to that of its defect-free equilibrium state. The broader view of melting provides a new perspective of damage-accumulation processes such as radiation damage, ion implantation, ion beam mixing, plastic deformation, and fracture. For example, within this conceptual framework, disorder-induced amorphization is simply polymorphous melting of a critically disordered crystal at temperatures below the glass transition temperature. In the present communication, we discuss the application of the concept to two specific cases: amorphous phase formation during ion implantation and solute segregation-induced intergranular fracture...|$|R
