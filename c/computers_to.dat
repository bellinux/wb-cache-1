5|$|As the Internet grew in {{popularity}} and its traffic {{was required to}} be routed into private networks, the TCP/IP protocols replaced existing local area network technologies. Additional technologies, such as DHCP, allowed TCP/IP-based <b>computers</b> <b>to</b> self-configure in the network. Such functions also existed in the AppleTalk/ IPX/ NetBIOS protocol sets.|$|E
50|$|The basic computer-to-UPS control {{methods are}} {{intended}} for one-to-one signaling from a single source to a single target. For example, a single UPS may connect <b>to</b> a single <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> provide status information about the UPS, and allow the <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> control the UPS. Similarly, the USB protocol is also intended to connect a single <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> multiple peripheral devices.|$|R

5|$|Decompression {{software}} {{is available for}} personal <b>computers</b> <b>to</b> model the decompression requirements of user specified dive profiles with different gas mixtures using a choice of decompression algorithms.

5|$|Parallel {{computers}} can be roughly classified {{according to the}} level at which the hardware supports parallelism, with multi-core and multi-processor computers having multiple processing elements within a single machine, while clusters, MPPs, and grids use multiple <b>computers</b> <b>to</b> work on the same task. Specialized parallel computer architectures are sometimes used alongside traditional processors, for accelerating specific tasks.|$|E
5|$|The program employs its own {{communication}} protocol layered {{on top of}} a schema to communicate to other nodes.

5|$|The use of <b>computers</b> <b>to</b> manage {{recreational}} dive decompression {{is becoming}} the standard and their use is also common in occupational scientific diving.

5|$|With the {{delivery}} of the first Cray-3, Seymour Cray immediately {{moved on to the}} similar-but-improved Cray-4 design, but the company went bankrupt before it was completely tested. The Cray-3 was Cray's last completed design; with CCC's bankruptcy he formed SRC <b>Computers</b> <b>to</b> concentrate on parallel designs, but died in a car accident in 1996 before this work was delivered.|$|E
5|$|A {{computer}} {{can act as}} one or {{all three of these}} components at the same time. The Xgrid protocol provides the basic infrastructure for <b>computers</b> <b>to</b> communicate, but is not involved in the processing of the specified calculation. Xgrid is targeted towards time consuming computations that can be easily segregated into smaller tasks, sometimes called embarrassingly parallel tasks. This includes Monte Carlo calculations, 3D rendering and Mandelbrot maps.|$|E

5|$|Computer science {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the automatic processing of information (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as computers. From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit <b>computers</b> <b>to</b> carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E
5|$|Due to a tight budget, Larkin {{was unable}} to hire an {{orchestra}} to perform the music; all the instruments in the soundtrack aside from Larkin's own trumpet playing are sampled instruments. Larkin {{used a variety of}} synthesizers, samplers, and <b>computers</b> <b>to</b> create the score, working at his home studio and Cyan's offices. Larkin found that the biggest challenge with the score was finishing it on time for the game to ship. The soundtrack was released in CD format on October 25, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Firearms combat is first-person, with {{character}} points {{assigned to}} the firearms skill determining the shot's accuracy {{and how long it}} takes to target an opponent. Melee combat is third-person, with access to weapons such as katanas and sledgehammers for melee combat, or pistols, crossbows and flamethrowers for firearm combat. If a player sneaks up on an opponent, they can perform an instant kill; weapons provide unique instant kill animations. The player can block attacks manually or automatically, by leaving their character idle. They can use stealth in missions by sneaking past guards and security cameras, picking locks, and hacking <b>computers</b> <b>to</b> locate alternative routes.|$|E

The LAWN system allowed two <b>computers</b> <b>to</b> exchange messages over a range of a couple hundred feet {{at a cost of}} about $500 per node. O'Neill Communications went out of business in 1993; the LAWN technology was sold to Omnispread Communications. As of 2008, Omnispread continued to sell a variant of O'Neill's LAWN system.|$|E
5|$|The Internet is a {{worldwide}} network {{of computers and}} computer networks that {{communicate with each other}} using the Internet Protocol. Any computer on the Internet has a unique IP address that can be used by other <b>computers</b> <b>to</b> route information to it. Hence, any computer on the Internet can send a message to any other computer using its IP address. These messages carry with them the originating computer's IP address allowing for two-way communication. The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{decompression}} sickness after diving {{can be managed}} through effective decompression procedures and contracting it is now uncommon, though it remains to some degree unpredictable. Its potential severity has driven much research to prevent it and divers almost universally use decompression tables or dive <b>computers</b> <b>to</b> limit or monitor their exposure and to control their ascent speed and decompression procedures. If DCS is contracted, it is usually treated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a recompression chamber. If treated early, there is a significantly higher chance of successful recovery.|$|E

The AW101 features a network of helicopter management and mission systems designed to reduce pilot workload and enable the helicopter to undertake {{a wide variety of}} missions. A digital automatic flight control system (AFCS) is employed by the AW101. The AFCS allows the operation of a four-axis (pitch, roll, yaw and collective) autopilot and the automatic stabilisation system, and is linked in with the aircraft's flight management systems. The AFCS, manufactured by Smiths Aerospace, is a dual-duplex system using two flight <b>computers</b> <b>to</b> provide redundancy and fault-tolerance.|$|E
5|$|Alien: Isolation is a single-player action-adventure {{game with}} heavy {{emphasis}} on stealth and survival horror features. The player controls the protagonist, Amanda Ripley, from a first-person perspective {{to interact with the}} environment. To advance through the game, the player must explore a space station and complete numerous objectives while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating enemies. Objectives range from activating <b>computers</b> <b>to</b> collecting certain items or reaching a specific area in the game. The player has the ability to run, climb ladders, and sneak into vents. The player can also crouch and hide behind objects to break the line of sight with enemies, and covertly peek over or lean around to gain view. The player also has the ability to go under nearby tables or inside lockers to hide from enemies.|$|E
5|$|In October‚ÄìDecember 1990, {{a team of}} {{employees}} from programming studio Softdisk calling themselves Ideas from the Deep developed the three-part video game Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, the first game in the Commander Keen series. The group, who worked at Softdisk in Shreveport, Louisiana developing games for the Gamer's Edge video game subscription service and disk magazine, was composed of programmers John Romero and John Carmack, designer Tom Hall, artist Adrian Carmack, and manager Jay Wilbur. After {{the release of the}} game in December through shareware publisher Apogee Software, the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss, Softdisk owner Al Vekovius, confronted them on both their plans and their use of company resources to develop the game‚Äîthe team had created it on their work computers, both in the office after hours and by taking the <b>computers</b> <b>to</b> John Carmack's house on the weekends‚Äîthe team made no secret of their intentions.
