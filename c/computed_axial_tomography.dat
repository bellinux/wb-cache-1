5|$|On August 10, 2001, on remand {{from the}} Florida Second District Court of Appeal, Judge Greer heard a motion from the Schindlers {{claiming}} that new medical treatment could restore sufficient cognitive ability such that Terri Schiavo herself {{would be able}} to decide to continue life-prolonging measures. The court also heard motions from the Schindlers to remove the guardian (Michael Schiavo) and to require Judge Greer to recuse himself. Judge Greer denied the motions and the Schindlers appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals. On October 17, 2001 the Court of Appeal affirmed the denials of the motions to remove and recuse. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that their opinion misled the trial court, and they remanded the question of Terri Schiavo's wishes back to the trial court and required an evidentiary hearing to be held. The court specified that five board certified neurologists were to testify. The Schindlers were allowed to choose two doctors to present findings at an evidentiary hearing while Michael Schiavo could introduce two rebuttal experts. Finally, the trial court itself would appoint a new independent physician to examine and evaluate Terri Schiavo's condition. (These decisions, all published in a single order by the Florida Second District Court of Appeal, came to be known by the court as Schiavo III in its later rulings.) In October 2002, on remand by the Second District Court of Appeal, an evidentiary hearing was held in Judge Greer's court to determine whether new therapy treatments could help Terri Schiavo restore any cognitive function. In preparation for the trial, a new <b>computed</b> <b>axial</b> <b>tomography</b> scan (CAT scan) was performed, which showed severe cerebral atrophy. An EEG showed no measurable brain activity. The five physicians chosen were Dr. William Maxfield, a radiologist, and four neurologists: Dr. William Hammesfahr, Dr. Ronald Cranford, Dr. Melvin Greer and Dr. Peter Bambakidis.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the applicability of a multiplanar reformatting program (dental scan) for delineation and quantitative evaluation of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in the sagittal and coronal planes using the data of <b>axial</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography.</b> The resulting images were compared with standardized linear tomograms and direct sagittal and frontal computed tomography. Standardized linear tomograms and computed tomography of the TMJ in axial, frontal and sagittal planes were obtained in 11 patients. The <b>axial</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> slices were then reconstructed in oblique frontal and sagittal planes according to the horizontal condylar angle of the TMJ by dental scan software. For each patient and each of the three imaging methods, 14 measurements were undertaken and 24 qualitative characterizations were assessed. <b>Axial</b> <b>computed</b> tomograms in combination with their corresponding coronal and sagittal reconstructions were more accurate than conventional tomograms. Direct coronal and sagittal scans gave the most detailed images, but required additional radiation dose, time and cost. Reconstructions of <b>axial</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> slices of the TMJ using the dental scan software show several advantages over linear tomograms. They allow qualitative as well as quantitative evaluation of the TMJ...|$|R

25|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) or <b>Computed</b> <b>Axial</b> <b>Tomography</b> (CAT) scanning uses {{a series}} of x-rays of the head taken from many different directions. Typically used for quickly viewing brain injuries, CT scanning uses a computer program that performs a numerical integral calculation (the inverse Radon transform) on the measured x-ray series to estimate {{how much of an}} x-ray beam is absorbed in a small volume of the brain. Typically the information is presented as cross sections of the brain.|$|E
25|$|Brain scans : The use {{of brain}} scans to {{investigate}} the structure or function of the brain is common, either as simply a way of better assessing brain injury with high resolution pictures, or by examining the relative activations of different brain areas. Such technologies may include fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) and positron emission tomography (PET), which yields data related to functioning, as well as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and <b>computed</b> <b>axial</b> <b>tomography</b> (CAT or CT), which yields structural data.|$|E
25|$|X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT), or <b>Computed</b> <b>Axial</b> <b>Tomography</b> (CAT) scan, is a helical tomography technique (latest generation), which traditionally produces a 2D {{image of the}} structures in a thin section of the body. In CT, a beam of X-rays spins around an object being examined and is picked up by sensitive radiation detectors after having penetrated the object from multiple angles. A computer then analyses the information received from the scanner's detectors and constructs a detailed image of the object and its contents using the mathematical principles {{laid out in the}} Radon transform. It has a greater ionizing radiation dose burden than projection radiography; repeated scans must be limited to avoid health effects. CT is based on the same principles as X-Ray projections but in this case, the patient is enclosed in a surrounding ring of detectors assigned with 500-1000 scintillation detectors (fourth-generation X-Ray CT scanner geometry). Previously in older generation scanners, the X-Ray beam was paired by a translating source and detector. Computed tomography has almost completely replaced focal plane tomography in X-ray tomography imaging.|$|E

A 1.25 -mm thick <b>axial</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) scan of the hip, knee, and ankle was performed on each patient before discharge using a previously described protocol (Nedopil et al. 2016; Nedopil et al. 2013).|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} assess the true {{deformity}} in the oblique plane, we use a method which requires an axial cross-sectional image (transverse plane) and {{an image of the}} hip in the AP position (coronal plane). Using these two images, the deformity can be calculated in the oblique plane. The head–neck angle is measured from the AP pelvis film to give angle x (Fig.  1). The head–neck angle is measured from the <b>axial</b> <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) scan to give angle y (Fig.  2). From this. the oblique plane deformity angle z can be calculated.|$|R
