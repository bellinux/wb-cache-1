40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} pair creation on a shock structure. Particles, accelerated in the shock via the first order Fermi process, are supposed to cool by inverse Compton process on external soft photons, resulting in a cut-off power law shape of the particle distribution function. The high energy photons produced are thus able to create pairs, through photon-photon annihilation. The increase of the pair pressure may then be sufficient to modify the shock profile. We {{show that there is}} even a limit of the pair pressure (of the order of 20 % of the ram pressure of the upstream flow) above which the shock cannot exist any longer. Conversely, significant changes of the flow velocity profile will also modify the spectral index and the high energy cut–off of the particle distribution function. Hence the number of particles able to trigger the pair creation process will change, modifying the pair <b>creation</b> rate <b>accordingly.</b> Taking into account these different processes, we self-consistently derive the flow velocity profile and the particle distribution function. We show that, in some region of the parameter space, the system can converge towards stationary states where pair creation and hydrodynamical effects balance. We discuss the application of this model to explain the high energy emission observed in compact objects. We show that hard X-ray spectra (αX < 1.) are only obtained for small pair pressure and we don’t expect any strong annihilation line in this case. We suggest also a possible variability mechanism if the soft photon compactness depends itself on the pair density of the hot plasma, such as expected in reillumination models.

S-D Logic researchers have acknowledged that customers do not only receive value, they contribute to create value and subjectively assess it in use - a notion that challenge the logic of traditional marketing. In interaction, suppliers have the opportunity to reveal processes of customer value <b>creation,</b> and <b>accordingly,</b> align these with its own internal processes. From this perspective, the supplier is turned into a co-creator of value. This study investigates the potentials of value co-creation, through interaction, within the context of card game encounters, an activity originally developed for traditional marketing purposes. Atlas Copco Rock Drills AB has implemented the method of the card game, and is now in search for academic support to identify the actual potentials of interaction within these encounters. By drawing on a literature review compromising (1) a conceptual model presenting the functions of direct interaction as a merging of processes (Grönroos & Voima 2013), and (2) a processed-based framework for co-creation of value (Payne et al. 2008), a qualitative study was conducted to investigate Atlas Copco employees’ perception of how supplier representatives and customers engage in learning process by co-creating value. The study provides guidance of how the supplier, through direct interaction, engages in the learning process through keeping a customer-oriented dialogue. Supplier representatives’ product-specific knowledge is operative to the comprehension of customer processes. It is also decisive for the organizational learning outcome from card game encounters. Statistical customer research with all due respect, however, interaction is the key to forming value propositions supporting real value creation. The study suggest an identification of mechanism supporting supplier and customer learning processes and show how supplier actions may influence the levels of customer learning within the context of discrete interactions. It suggests that customers’ (1) cognitive ability are to be supported in information search, (2) emotions are to be supported by recognition and appreciation and (3) behavioral elements of value creation are to be supported through the sharing of knowledge and skills...|$|R

Generally, it can be said that intellectuality is the most important and the most valuable property of educational centers such as universities and is the main key to development. Naturally, for the materialization of knowledge creation in universities as one the most important issues of the third millennium, there are different factors at work and among these factors, institutional culture and its effects on knowledge creation have been investigated in this study. The population of this study included all the faculty members of the University of Isfahan (476 cases) of whom 142 cases were selected based on Cochran formula. A questionnaire was used for data collection and the method employed in this study was survey.

40|$|A {{catalyst}} for this inquiry was concern that executive pay had {{got out of}} hand. This perception was fuelled by practices in financial institutions abroad that were seen as a key contributor to the global financial crisis. Further, while local shareholder value plummeted in 2008 {{as a result of}} that imported crisis — with some companies and sectors being propped up by taxpayers — executive pay seemed to emerge unscathed, crystallising a view that executives were being rewarded for failure (after having been rewarded for success). This has come on top of longstanding community discomfort about the widening gap between the remuneration of executives and other employees, as well as some large termination payments with perceived lack of justification. Public opinion polling over the years consistently shows that most respondents believe executives to be overpaid. But polls also reveal limited awareness of the drivers of executive pay and wealth <b>creation.</b> <b>Accordingly,</b> this inquiry was tasked with ascertaining what has actually happened to executive pay in Australia’s publicly-listed companies, as well as identifying what can and should be done about it. The appropriate test for any policy intervention is that it promotes community wellbeing: hence the Commission has explored the likely drivers of executive pay and the economic implications of current pay levels and structures. Ultimately, judgment must be exercised, particularly in relation to the magnitude of identified problems and the case for intervention, taking into account both the potential costs and benefits. The Commission's final recommendations constitute an integrated package of reforms that would strengthen board decision-making on executive remuneration, by reducing board 'clubbiness', removing potential for conflicts of interest and enhancing accountability for pay outcomes. Shareholders would get better information and would have more 'say on pay'. executive remuneration, termination benefits, remuneration packages, equity-based payments...|$|E

Namely through the contact method of the photogram, the photochemical organism and its material potential are explored put in relation to the very elements of nature. With fundamental guideline in the work of Gaston Bachelard, the matter of the four elements - fire, water, air and earth - and the integral tree are evidenced as fertile breeding ground for poetic imagination and artistic creation. In this thought lies a spiritual and mystical meaning of art as it was understood by Paul Klee. The four elements and the Tree are revisited through some of its primitive and eternal meanings, ambivalent significances by alchemy, and poetic approaches faithful to each one. The vitality of elements in the photochemical organism is also emphasized. The importance given to the collaboration between matter of nature and human nature, in ways of discovering and reinventing, accentuates the symbolic values of alchemy in understanding the world, studied through Carl Gustav Jung and Mircea Eliade. In the mysteries of alchemy and in the secretive contact and transformation of matter in creative processes, the shadow is considered as an essential notion in understanding the invisibility of the world. The artistic making devoted to matter is analyzed in reference to works of artists, emphasizing the trees of Alberto Carneiro, the shadows of Lourdes Castro and Pierre Cordier's chemigrams. Throughout the study, it is sought to relate the conceptual and procedural aspects of the installation Herbarium Caminhada with the research developed, and clarify how the Tree confided gestures in their productio...|$|E

Computer Science and Engineering [...] - Structure of The Field Computation is synthetic {{in the sense that}} many of the phenomena computer scientists and engineers study are created by humans rather than occurring naturally in the physical world. As Professor Fred Brooks of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill observed [Academic Careers, 94, p. 35], When one discovers a fact about nature, it is a contribution per se, no matter how small. Since anyone can create something new [in a synthetic field], that alone does not establish a contribution. Rather, one must show that the <b>creation</b> is better. <b>Accordingly,</b> research in computer science and engineering is largely devoted to establishing the "better" property. The computer science and engineering field in academe is composed of faculty who apply one of two basic research paradigms: theory or experimentation. Generalizing, theoreticians tend to conduct research that resembles mathematics. The phenomena are abstract, and the intellectual contribution is usually expressed in the form of theorems with proofs. Though conference publication is highly regarded in the theoretical community, there is a long tradition of completing, revising, and extending conference papers for submission and publication in archival journals. Accordingly, faculty who pursue theoretical work are often more easily evaluated by traditional academic mechanisms. Nevertheless, the discussion below regarding "impact" will apply to theoretical work, too. As a second generalization, experimentalists tend to conduct research that involves creating computational artifacts and assessing them.

Predicting the motives and needs of tourists in the consumption of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages is of special interest to managers in the hospitality industry. This paper analyses interdependence {{and the impact of}} weather changes on the consumption of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages. The objective is to analyse the interdependence of the weather (climate) and consumption so that the managers could more successfully create future level of tourist demand for alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages as an important segment in the creation of tourist consumption in hospitality companies. Design – The research model of the set tasks are hospitality companies for provision of beverage services, i. e. benchmarking with comparable hospitality companies. The used data are those of weather changes in the Adriatic destinations of Porec, Opatija, Mali Lošinj, Zadar, Šibenik, Split, Hvar, and Dubrovnik. Methodology – Regression analysis is used to verify the set hypothesis, that the quantity of consumed beverages increases with {{the increase in the number}} of overnights and air temperature. Approach – The intention is to verify the hypothesis that the weather i. e. temperature changes, humidity, and precipitation determine pleasant atmosphere which affects the level of consumption of beverages. Findings –Multiple determination coefficient of 99 % shows that 99 % of variations in the quantity of the consumed beverages is explained by changes in the number of overnights i. e. air temperature. Originality of the research – The analysed impacts of climate changes on the consumption of beverages is analysed on the example of Adriatic tourist destinations. Research results are applicable in practice and are especially useful to managers on the tourist market regarding prediction of weather changes and, <b>accordingly,</b> <b>creation</b> of high-quality products and services...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 Background: Male Circumcision (MMC) of {{adolescent}} {{boys and men}} is an effective and potentially cost-effective intervention {{for the prevention of}} HIV. Most high HIV burden, low MMC prevalence countries in sub-Saharan Africa have fallen short of WHO/UNAIDS targets for the uptake of MMC for 2016, despite significant demand generation efforts. The aim of this dissertation project was to apply economic and psychology decision theories to study the incentives that drive the uptake of MMC for HIV prevention. Methods: The study was conducted in Mukono and Buikwe districts among predominantly fishing communities at landing sites on the northern shores of Lake Victoria, in Uganda. We conducted 11 focus group discussions and six key informant interviews to explore the economic and psychological factors affecting the uptake of MMC for HIV prevention. Based on the factors identified, we designed and executed a stated-preference discrete choice experimental (DCE) survey, coupled with measurement of psychological factors among 406 self-reported heterosexual, uncircumcised, HIV-negative men between 18 - 45 years-old. We used mixed logit, latent class logit and parameter-covariate mixed logit models to estimate preferences for MMC attributes, and to examine the extent to which preferences are influenced by psychological factors. Results: The demand for MMC was conceptualized as a process of valuation formation—based on psychological factors (HIV threat perceptions, subjective beliefs about MMC outcomes, and normative expectations), and action—based on economic factors (preferences for MMC service attributes). Socioeconomic characteristics and personality traits could explain differences in how people respond to factors at each stage of this process. In the DCE, marginal utilities (µ; se) were highest for accessing services at permanent health facilities (2. 138; 0. 214), and incentives: voucher vs none (0. 512; 0. 153) and cash vs none (0. 968; 0. 174). Marginal disutility (µ; se) was highest for device MMC (- 1. 674; 0. 265). There was significant heterogeneity in preferences for accessing services at permanent health facilities (partly explained by subjective probability of pain during the MMC procedure), number of week-days during which services were available at facilities, device circumcision (partly explained by difference in the subjective probability of infection and pain from the MMC procedure, expected time away from work and sex after the MMC procedure), cash incentives and price/value of incentive compensation. Conclusion: Preferences were strongest permanent health facilities, surgical circumcision and incentives. Heterogeneity in preferences for these MMC service attributes exists and was only partly explained by the sociodemographic characteristics and subjective beliefs about MMC outcomes. MMC service delivery should be optimized based on individual preferences for these attributes. Further research should identify more demographic, and other non-observable influences on preferences, e. g., social influences and non-observable personality traits, {{that could be used to}} channel demand <b>creation</b> interventions <b>accordingly...</b>|$|R
