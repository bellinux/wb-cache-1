The only way to differentiate alforsite from other barium minerals is through microchemical analysis (Walstrom and Leising, 2005). This misleading mineral emulates the physical and structural features of apatite and is analogously similar to chlorapatite, providing alfrosite with the alternate name, barium chlorapatite. Alforsite has a low birefringence and a high relief resembling fluorapatite in thin-section. A reddish-violet cathodoluminescence appears on thin-section showing major levels of chlorine, phosphorus, and barium.

50|$|The {{crystallization}} of ACC {{can occur}} in two stages: first, the ACC nanoparticles rapidly dehydrate and <b>crystallize</b> <b>to</b> form individual particles of vaterite. Secondly, the vaterite transforms to calcite via a dissolution and reprecipitation mechanism with the reaction rate controlled by the surface area of calcite. The second stage of the reaction is approximately 10 times slower. However, the crystallization of calcite has been observed {{to be dependent on}} the starting pH and presence of Mg in solution. A neutral starting pH during mixing promotes the direct transformation of ACC into calcite. Conversely, when ACC forms in a solution that starts with a basic initial pH, the transformation to calcite occurs via metastable vaterite, which forms via a spherulitic growth mechanism. In a second stage this vaterite transforms to calcite via a surface-controlled dissolution and recrystallization mechanism. Mg has a noteworthy effect on both the stability of ACC and its transformation to crystalline CaCO3, resulting in the formation of calcite directly from ACC, as this ion destabilizes the structure of vaterite.|$|E

This phenomenon may be explained based on the Ostwald’s step rule as observed in the report of the thermal experiment of synthetic opal (Arasuna et al. 2013). The difference of the Raman band position attributed to the six-membered ring of the cristobalite between the heated sample and the well-crystallized cristobalite indicates that heating at a higher temperature is necessary for bleached samples to completely <b>crystallize</b> <b>to</b> cristobalite.|$|E
