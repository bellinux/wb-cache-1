The development of methods for the active control of magnetohydrodynamic instabilities and <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> fields is mandatory in view of fusion reactors or experimental test reactors under design. Recently, a very effective control scheme, named clean mode control (CMC), has been proposed in a reversed field pinch experiment (RFX-mod). The CMC is based on the real-time correction (cleaning), under simplifying hypothesis, of the sideband harmonics in the magnetic field produced by the discrete local active coils. In this paper, we focus on the problem of carefully computing the penetration of sidebands through a realistic load assembly, but still with a simplified cylindrical geometry, to allow for a detailed comparison with the crude CMC algorithm without the additional complication of the coupling between the poloidal harmonics due to the toroidal geometry...|$|E

Past few decades several papers describes reliability growth phenomenon. As the time progress, the number of errors detection and correction also increases.

Generally a Testing-effort is better described by number of persons involved; number of test cases used and calendar time.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a navigation method which enables a mobile robot to perform autonomous locomotion. And {{the feasibility of}} this method was demonstrated using experimental hardware, a prototype robot with ultrasonic sensors. This method uses simple shaped objects, such as poles and flat surfaces of walls selected from the environment, as landmarks and a map indicating the relations of these landmarks. The robot moves from a given point to another along a designed path using its own sensors. At each point it measures the position of natural objects selected as landmarks and corrects its path. The basic problems encountered in realizing this method are discussed. They are path design which connects two points in the environment, control of a mobile robot to move along its path, measurement of objects'positions using an ultrasonic sensor and <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> from its designed path. A basic technique necessary to navigate a mobile robot {{is the ability to}} control it so that it follows a designed path accurately. Because of the lack of absolute position information, a mobile robot needs to get accurate position data from its surroundings. This method uses natural objects to gain such information. And it has the merits that it can reduce the equipment investment to the environment to supply position data and that it can simplify the object detection problem by giving information about objects...|$|E
40|$|The {{movement}} of experimental philosophy criticizes traditional philosophy’s armchair reliance on intuition. The critique is rarely spelled out precisely; rather, experimental philosophers simply {{point to the}} admittedly surprising results of intuition surveys, which are, roughly, that intuitions vary with factors presumed to be irrelevant to the subject matter in question. 1 However, the question what is wrong exactly with armchair philosophy is rarely answered adequately. 2 Jonathan Weinberg (2007) has offered what I take {{to be the most}} compelling answer so far: Reliance on philosophical intuition is problematic because we have no tools for detecting and correcting its errors. Weinberg introduces the technical term ‘hopefulness ’ for the property of methods to allow for the detection and <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> <b>error.</b> A method is hopeful if it meets all or most of the following desiderata to some sufficient degree: external corroboration, internal coherence, detectability of margins, and theoretical illumination. A method is clearly hopeless when it fails to meet any of the desiderata. According to Weinberg this is the case for the philosophers ’ practice of appealing to intuitions. He further argues for the epistemic principle that “[a]ny putative source of evidence that is hopeless ought not be trusted ” (2007, 327; emphasis omitted) and thus concludes, that the practice of appealing to intuitions ought to be abandoned (or revised) ...|$|E

Results: There was improvement in reliability indices after full <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> refractive <b>errors,</b> but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0. 3).
