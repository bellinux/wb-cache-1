40|$|Group B Streptococcus (GBS) type III capsular {{polysaccharide}} (CPS III) was conjugated to recombinant cholera toxin B subunit (rCTB) using three different methods which employed (i) cystamine and N-succinimidyl- 3 -(2 -pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP), (ii) carbodiimide with adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH) as a spacer, or (iii) reductive amination (RA). The CPS III-rCTB conjugates {{were divided into}} large- and small-molecular-weight (Mr) fractions, and the immunogenicities of the different preparations after intranasal (i. n.) immunization were studied in mice. Both large- and small-Mr conjugates of CPS III-rCTBRA or CPS III-rCTBADH induced high, almost comparable levels of CPS-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) in serum, lungs, and vagina that were generally superior to those obtained with CPS III-rCTBSPDP conjugates or a CPS III and rCTB mixture. However, the smaller-Mr conjugates of CPS III-rCTBRA or CPS III-rCTBADH in most cases elicited a lower anti-CPS IgA immune response than the large-Mr conjugates, and the highest anti-CPS IgA titers in both tissues and serum were obtained with the large-Mr CPS III-rCTBRA <b>conjugate.</b> <b>Serum</b> IgG anti-CPS titers induced by the CPS III-rCTBRA conjugate had high levels of specific IgG 1, IgG 2 a, IgG 2 b, and IgG 3 antibodies. Based {{on the effectiveness of}} RA for coupling CPS III to rCTB, RA was also tested for conjugating GBS CPS Ia with rCTB. As for the CPS III-rCTB conjugates, the immunogenicity of CPS Ia was greatly increased by conjugation to rCTB. Intranasal immunization with a combination of CPS Ia-rCTB and CPS III-rCTB conjugates was shown to induce anti-CPS Ia and III immune responses in serum and lungs that were fully comparable with the responses to immunization with the monovalent CPS Ia-rCTB or CPS III-rCTB conjugates. These results suggest that the GBS CPS III-rCTB and CPS Ia-rCTB conjugates prepared by the RA method may be used in bivalent and possibly also in multivalent mucosal GBS conjugate vaccines...|$|E

Bilirubin conjugates were not detectable in the healthy adults, maternal blood, {{or in the}} cord blood specimens except from infants with blood group incompatibility or intrauterine hypoxia. The two isomeric monoconjugates of bilirubin appeared in serum during the first 24 to 48 postnatal h in both premature and full term infants, followed by the diconjugate on the 3 rd day. Conjugated esters accounted for 2 to 5 % of the total bilirubin, with the diconjugate constituting 21 % of total conjugated pigment (day 3).

40|$|A {{study was}} made of cells in the {{pregnant}} rat uterus and placenta known to contain glycoprotein inclusions to investigate their ability to endocytose marker proteins (fluorescein <b>conjugated</b> <b>serum</b> and horseradish peroxidase) injected into the maternal circulation. The visceral endoderm showed marked uptake of both proteins, though in later pregnancy this was restricted {{to the area of}} yolk sac adjacent to the chorio-allantoic placenta. The intracellular distribution of the endocytosed marker proteins resembled that of the glycoprotein inclusions. In the earlier stages some of the giant cell inclusions contained glycoprotein, some showed staining with the Dunn-Thompson technique for haemoglobin, and some showed peroxidase activity. There was endocytosis of both marker proteins by giant cells, and apparently this occurred independently of ingestion of red blood cells. Uptake by the giant cells persisted to a later stage in the area round the margin of the chorio-allantoic placenta than in the other giant cells. Endocytosis occurred in the labyrinthine trophoblast, and the glycoprotein inclusions found in this situation may represent material being transmitted or digested. The glycoprotein-containing granulated metrial gland cells showed no evidence of endocytotic activity, but there was uptake of both marker proteins by the associated stromal cells...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{free and}} <b>conjugated</b> <b>serum</b> bile acid (BA) levels in {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD) subgroups with defined clinical manifestations. METHODS: Comprehensive serum BA profiling was performed in 358 IBD patients and 310 healthy controls by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Serum levels of hyodeoxycholic acid, the CYP 3 A 4 -mediated detoxification product of the secondary BA lithocholic acid (LCA), was increased significantly in Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), while most other serum BA species were decreased significantly. Total BA, total BA conjugate, and total BA glycoconjugate levels were decreased only in CD, whereas total unconjugated BA levels were decreased only in UC. In UC patients with hepatobiliary manifestations, the conjugated primary BAs glycocholic acid, taurocholic acid, and glycochenodeoxycholic acid were as significantly increased as the secondary BAs LCA, ursodeoxycholic acid, and tauroursodeoxycholic acid compared to UC patients without hepatobiliary manifestations. Finally, we found that in ileocecal resected CD patients, the unconjugated primary BAs, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, were increased significantly compared to controls and patients without surgical interventions. CONCLUSION: Serum BA profiling in IBD patients that indicates impaired intestinal barrier function and increased detoxification is suitable for advanced diagnostic characterization and differentiation of IBD subgroups with defined clinical manifestations...|$|R

To evaluate the serum bisphenol A (BPA) levels in boys with cryptorchidism and healthy boys and to assess the risk of environmental exposure to BPA using the authors’ questionnaire. The data were acquired from a study on boys with cryptorchidism (n= 98) and a control group (n= 57). Prior to surgery, all patients had BPA serum levels evaluated. The size, position, rigidity of the testis, and abnormality of the epididymis of the undescended testis were assessed.

40|$|Abstract Background Occupational {{exposure}} to airborne {{low molecular weight}} chemicals, like trimellitic anhydride (TMA), can result in occupational asthma. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are among the first cells to encounter these inhaled compounds and were previously shown to influence TMA-induced asthma-like symptoms in the Brown Norway rat. TMA is a hapten that will bind to endogenous proteins upon entrance of the body. Therefore, {{in the present study}} we determined if TMA and TMA <b>conjugated</b> to <b>serum</b> albumin induced the production of the macrophage mediators nitric oxide (NO), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin 6 (IL- 6) in vitro using the rat AM cell line NR 8383 and primary AMs derived from TMA-sensitized and naïve Brown Norway rats. Methods Cells were incubated with different concentrations of TMA, TMA <b>conjugated</b> to bovine <b>serum</b> albumin (BSA), and BSA as a control for 24 h and the culture supernatant was analyzed for mediator content. Results TMA alone was not able to induce the production of mediators by NR 8383 cells and primary AMs from sensitized and sham-treated rats. TMA-BSA, on the contrary, dose-dependently stimulated the production of NO, TNF, and IL- 6 by NR 8383 cells and of NO and TNF, but not IL- 6, by primary AMs independent of sensitization. Conclusion Results suggest that although TMA is a highly reactive compound, conjugation to a suitable protein is necessary to induce mediator production by AMs. Furthermore, the observation that effects of TMA-BSA were independent of sensitization suggests involvement of an immunologically non-specific receptor. In the discussion it is argued that a macrophage scavenger receptor is a likely candidate. </p...|$|R
