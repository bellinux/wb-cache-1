50|$|The Van Veen Grab Sampler is an {{instrument}} to sample sediment in water environments. Usually it is a <b>clamshell</b> <b>bucket</b> made out of stainless steel. Up to 20 cm deep samples of roughly 0.1 m2 can be extracted with this instrument. It can be light-weight (roughly 5 kg) and low-tech. The smallest version even fits into hand luggage.|$|E
5000|$|Plant 1 was the {{administrative}} headquarters, {{and also the}} main repair facility. Plant 1 and Plant 2 were marine unload operations.

50|$|One of Doepkeâ€™s {{best selling}} items was its steel crane, first {{manufactured}} in 1949. It {{was one of}} the most popular pressed steel construction toys ever made. It was rugged enough to survive the rigors of outdoor use and had realistic details like rubber Goodyear tires. The toy had two functional hand crank hoists, accurate rigging, a stamped steel open lattice boom and a working <b>clamshell</b> <b>bucket</b> used for excavating. The toy was priced at $14.95.|$|E
50|$|It is {{said the}} company's {{entry into the}} {{construction}} of dredging equipment began in 1876 when {{they were asked to}} construct machinery to recover lost gold from the sea west of the coast of Spain. No gold was found but the company's equipment proved useful for dredging of harbours and docks; the company pioneered the manufacture of steam powered cranes with grab (<b>clamshell)</b> <b>buckets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although, {{in later}} years, the colliers faced {{competition}} from the railways in supplying coal for domestic use in the capital, large quantities of coal were used at the numerous power stations {{on the banks of}} the River Thames, and wharves were constructed alongside them for unloading the colliers. The wharf at Battersea Power Station is still extant, and the cranes used for unloading the coal can be seen on the riverfront. These are fitted with <b>clamshell</b> <b>buckets</b> and in operation loaded a hopper, which in turn fed a conveyor system leading to the power station's coal bunkers. The modern equivalent can be seen at the Tyne Coal Terminal, unloading bulk carriers. Gas Light and Coke Company had similar facilities at its large gasworks, also alongside the Thames, for handling the large quantity of bituminous coal which was needed to supply the capital with town gas.|$|R
40|$|Dust {{emissions}} from diffuse sources {{are part of}} the existing air pollution. The dust is mainly due to industrial production processes where the greatest part, about 90 %, is caused by the storage and transfer of bulk solids. The main defference between point and diffuse sources lie in the emission mechanisms of particles {{as well as in the}} time dependency of arising emissions. Because of these differences the numerous existing techniques for the assessment of point dust sources and existing models for the calculation of the spread are not adequate. The theoretical approach used here to introduce the Magnus force as a decisive factor for dust rotation was verified by dumping tests in air and water and by assessing the forces occuring. By the evaluation of the measures for the reduction of dust during the discharge of <b>clamshell</b> <b>buckets</b> and during the transfer of bulk solids from one conveyor to another dust emissions could be reduced by 92 % by taking into consideration certain principles...|$|R
5000|$|Grapple trucks {{enable the}} {{collection}} of bulk waste. A large percentage of items in the solid waste stream are too large or too heavy to be safely lifted by hand into traditional garbage trucks. These items (furniture, large appliances, branches, logs) are called bulky waste or [...] "oversized." [...] The preferred method for collecting these items is with a grapple truck. Grapple trucks have hydraulic knucklebooms, tipped with a <b>clamshell</b> <b>bucket,</b> and usually include a dump body or trailer.|$|E
50|$|Barge {{unloading}} {{should be}} conducted {{in a manner that}} minimizes the amount of cargo spilled onto the deck. The unloading process {{is the responsibility of the}} unloader operator at the unloading facility. Unloading can be done with a Grab Bucket Barge Unloader or a Continuous Barge Unloader (CBU). The Grab Bucket system employs a <b>clamshell</b> <b>bucket</b> suspended by a set of hoisting cables, with a separate set of control cables that open and close the bucket. The CBU is a series of buckets supported between two strands of roller chain, running in a continuous loop.|$|E
50|$|As an example, imagine {{dredging}} using a clamshell dredger, which deposits the {{dredged material}} on a barge that takes its load {{to a separate}} area and dumps it overboard. In this scenario, a dredge plume {{can be expected to}} begin at the bottom as the <b>clamshell</b> <b>bucket</b> stirs up loose material. As it rises through the water column to the surface, any material not fully contained by the bucket also creates a plume. At the dumping site, a dredge plume begins at the surface as the material enters the water column from above.|$|E

He was posted to the 10th Field Artillery Brigade as its acting adjutant and temporary quartermaster on 15 November 1932, and transferred to the Australian Field Artillery on 6 December 1933. He became acting commander of the 24th Battery in June 1936. This appointment became substantive when he {{was promoted}} to major on 19 March 1937. [...] He joined the United Stevedoring Company, a subsidiary of P, in 1932. He worked on a project to improve the unloading of coal, which had been accomplished by shovelling it into baskets and hoisting them down to the wharf. He replaced these with <b>clamshell</b> <b>buckets,</b> which hoisted the coal directly onto railway trucks. In 1938, he went into business with his former boss at United Stevedoring, Captain Jack Williams, founding a general engineering company called Fleet Forge Pty Ltd. A major contract was from the Royal Australian Navy to equip defensively equipped merchant ships. He married Gwen Victoria Goddard Britton, a [...] saleswoman, on 31 March 1934 at St Columba's Church in Elwood, Victoria. He wore his Army uniform for the ceremony. They had a son, John, born in 1934, and a daughter, Jill, in 1939.|$|R
50|$|A caisson is sunk by self-weight, {{concrete}} {{or water}} ballast placed on top, or by hydraulic jacks. The leading edge (or cutting shoe) of the caisson is sloped {{out at a}} sharp angle to aid sinking in a vertical manner; it is usually made of steel. The shoe is generally wider than the caisson to reduce friction, and the leading edge may be supplied with pressurised bentonite slurry, which swells in water, stabilizing settlement by filling depressions and voids. An open caisson may fill with water during sinking. The material is excavated by <b>clamshell</b> excavator <b>bucket</b> on crane.|$|R
40|$|Dredging {{has evolved}} into a highly {{sophisticated}} process drawing from some of the latest technology. The methods of navigational dredging range from <b>clamshell</b> <b>buckets</b> to sophisticated hydraulic dredges. More recently, these techniques have evolved into the processes used for environmental dredging applications. High concentrations of certain contaminants in sediments pose human heath and ecological risks. Dredging of contaminated sediment provides a method of removal of these contaminants of concern (COC). One of the most obvious benefits of environmental dredging is the fact the contaminated sediments are permanently removed from the water body. These sediments are typically disposed of in an upland containment facility or landfill. In some cases disposal of contaminates may not be permitted or the costs to transport them to a permitted facility may be very high. Alternate uses for the contaminated sediments may be considered and may help to reduce or eliminate risks. The cost of these alternate treatment and use methods must be evaluated against other permit-able disposal options. Of paramount concern when dredging is the ability of the process to remove the COCs to a level that is below the regulated concentration. Although dredging techniques have been demonstrated to reduce sediment contaminant concentrations, it appears that these techniques can result in residual contamination. This residual contamination {{may be the result of}} re-suspension of contaminates into the water column or sloughing of adjacent materials into the dredged areas. Concern over these residual concentrations may lead to subsequent passes or other means to minimize risk from the residuals. The impacts of the cleanup activity to the surrounding area need to be evaluated regarding the impact of the operation or long-term disturbance of an area. A dredging operation will typically require some sort of sediment dewatering process. After removal of the solids, the associated water may have to be treated before it can be discharged back into the waterway. Because of these facts a dredging operation typically requires onshore support facilities. Construction of these facilities will likely impact the area surrounding the dredged area...|$|R
50|$|The Young Grab, or the Young Modified Van Veen Grab Sampler is an {{instrument}} to sample sediment in the ocean. It is {{a modified version of}} the Van Veen grab sampler, with a <b>clamshell</b> <b>bucket</b> made out of stainless steel mounted to a supporting frame. The sampling area extracted with this instrument can vary depending on its size. With the modifications this version of the Van Veen grab sampler is heavier than the traditional version. The frame allows for better stability and level sampling. Weights can be attached to the frame to ensure the bucket grabs sufficient sediment, or skids to ensure the gear does not sink too deep in soft sediments.|$|E

The Japanese launch a major attack, which the Seabees barely manage to hold off, sometimes using heavy construction machinery such as bulldozers and a <b>clamshell</b> <b>bucket.</b> When word reaches Donovan of another approaching enemy column, there are no sailors left to oppose this new threat. In desperation, he rigs a bulldozer with explosives on its blade, intending to ram it into a petroleum storage tank.

However, Wedge is shot in the process and dies in the explosion.|$|E
50|$|Ring {{discharge}} grabs have {{a single}} supporting rope or chain which means that a port with limited craneage, or even a ship's lifting boom can be used at a port where no facilities are available for bulk handling to load or offload the cargo. A cast steel ring is hung {{from the end of}} the boom through which the rope or chain passes to the grab. The outside of the ring has a lip at its lower edge. The top of the grab has a pivoting hook protruding from the top girder which catches the lip and allows opening and closing.

The results of research carried out, mostly relates {{to the use of}} clamshells in dry bulk materials. While good prediction of the forces (in dry materials) involved are possible by measuring the closing curve, the very prediction of the closing curve of clamshells in general, seems to be problematic. The research carried out by Becker, Miedema, Wittekoek and de Jong (1992) resulted in a numerical method of calculating the closing process of clamshell grabs in water saturated sand and clay, which simulates the closing of a clamshell so that production and forces can be predicted. The calculation method is based on the non-linear equations of motion of the buckets and the sand cutting theory Miedema presented in 1987 and 2006 and the clay cutting theory presented by Miedema (1992). The production of a clamshell depends on: 1. The dimensions of the clamshell. 2. The weight and weight distribution of the clamshell. 3. The geometry of the clamshell and especially the cutting edges. 4. The type of soil, the soil mechanical parameters. 5. The water depth...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} reveals {{little about}} the prediction of the closing process of <b>clamshell</b> dredging <b>buckets</b> when cutting sand or clay under water. The results of research carried out, mostly relates {{to the use of}} clamshells in dry bulk materials. While good prediction of the forces (in dry materials) involved are possible by measuring the closing curve, the very prediction of the closing curve of clamshells in general, seems to be problematic. Because the dredging business is concerned with water-saturated sand or clay has to be dredged, the research into the closing process of clamshell grabs had to start from scratch (except for the kinematics of clamshells). In 1989 the research carried out by Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company resulted in a numerical method of calculating the closing process of clamshell grabs in water saturated sand and clay, which simulates the closing of a clamshell so that production and forces can be predicted. The calculation method is based on the non-linear equations of motion of the buckets and the sand cutting theory Miedema presented at WODCON XII. A clay cutting theory is implemented in the numerical model but will not be taken into consideration in this paper. In 1991, Great Lakes and the Delft University of Technology carried out laboratory research in which a scale model clamshell was used. This research, carried out in dry and in water saturated sand, resulted in a verification and validation of the calculation method with respect to the closing curve, the angular velocity and the pulling force in the closing wire. This paper contains results of a literature survey, the equations of motion of a clamshell grab, background to the sand cutting theory, results of the computer program CLAMSHELL, and it will give some {{of the results of the}} research carried out with respect to verification and validation of the computer program...|$|R

50|$|Self-dumping grabs {{also have}} a single {{supporting}} rope or chain. The lower girder contains a linkage mechanism with hooks which connect to the upper girder, holding the grab closed. When the grab is lowered onto the spoil, weights release the hooks and allow the grab to open when lifted. A lever may also be fitted {{to this type of}} mechanism to which a long trip rope can be attached which, when pulled by a banksman, releases the catches in the mechanism and allows the grab to open in mid air (e.g. above a lorry or a hopper).

The wire ropes are operated by whatever prime movers the designers have available, operating through a variety of transmissions.

This was later modified when using IC engines to match the steam engines' [...] "max torque at zero speed" [...] characteristic by the addition of a hydrokinetic element culminating in controlled torque converters. The operational advantages of this arrangement can now be achieved by electronic control of hydrostatic drives, which for size and other considerations is becoming standard. Some examples of this type of crane can be converted to a demolition crane by adding a demolition ball, or to an earthmover by adding a <b>clamshell</b> <b>bucket</b> or a dragline and scoop, although design details can limit their effectiveness.|$|E
