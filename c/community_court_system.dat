40|$|This {{paper will}} study {{the subject of}} locus standi of non-state actors within the dispute {{resolution}} regimes established by the EU and NAFTA. While NAFTA addresses the issue on a sectoral basis, the EU deals with it as an institutional and constitutional matter. The purpose of the paper is to juxtapose the different approaches and their solutions {{to the issue of}} the protection of the rights of private parties as devised in the two regional arrangements. The first part will discuss the nature of the two agreements and will focus on NAFTA as a regional agreement without institutions in comparison to the EU which represents an enterprise in regional integration equipped with powerful and authoritative institutions. The setting explained, I will elaborate on the concept of private party and follow with a general review of the choice of remedy (or the selection of dispute resolution mechanisms). Then, the distinction between direct versus non-direct access will be explored, for the main challenge to the private party's right to remedy arising from the inter- and supranational arrangements lies in this particular detail. Next, I will analyze the private party direct access to dispute resolution in NAFTA. Most relevant to this paper is the NAFTA Chapter 11 Section B dealing with dispute resolution regarding investments and the investor's right direct access. Dispute resolution and private party direct access in the EU will involve a discussion of the <b>Community</b> <b>court</b> <b>system</b> and of ART. 173 (4) of the EC treaty in particular. The paper will conclude with observations on the difference between NAFTA and the EU concerning approaches to private party direct access...|$|E

30|$|Effective {{contract}} {{enforcement is}} the key to the process of economic development. A contract can be enforced by the formal legal court or by informal <b>community</b> <b>courts,</b> for instance panchayats in South Asia. In less developed societies both types of institutions co-exist, often coming in each others way. These conflicts are well documented in the context of the marriage market and common property management (Chowdhry 2004; Keremane et al. 2006; Madsen 1991; Nagraj 2010; Yadav 2009). However, till date there has not been any study that analyzes and estimates the effect of such interactions on economic decision making. In this paper we look at the effect of the interaction between the informal loan network and formal <b>court</b> <b>system</b> on the decision to run a business using both analytical and quantitative methods. We find that the informal network helps in business proliferation when the formal <b>court</b> <b>system</b> is weak. However, when the formal <b>court</b> <b>system</b> improves sufficiently, business might fall in areas with strong informal networks.|$|R

40|$|The first <b>community</b> <b>court</b> {{opened in}} Midtown Manhattan in 1993. Focusing on quality-of-life offenses, such as drug possession, shoplifting, vandalism,and prostitution, the Midtown <b>Community</b> <b>Court</b> sought to combine {{punishment}} and help, sentencing low-level offenders to perform visible community restitution, receive on site social services, including drug treatment, counseling, and job training. There are currently more than 60 <b>community</b> <b>court</b> projects in operation worldwide. In the United States alone there are 33 {{while there are}} 17 in South Africa, 13 in England and Wales, and one each in Australia and Canada. <b>Community</b> <b>courts</b> seek to achieve a variety of goals, such as reduced crime, increased engagement between citizens and the courts, improved perceptions of neighborhood safety, greater accountability for low level,"quality-of-life" offenders, speedier and more meaningful case resolutions, and cost savings. In advancing these goals, <b>community</b> <b>courts</b> generally make greater use of community-based sanctions than traditional courts (Hakuta, Soroushian,and Kralstein, 2008; Katz, 2009; Sviridoff et al., 2000; Weidner and Davis, 2000). Among a sample of 25 <b>community</b> <b>courts</b> surveyed in 2007, 92 percent routinely use community service mandates, and 84 percent routinely use social services mandates (Karafin, 2008).

40|$|Sentencing drug {{crimes and}} {{treating}} drug-addicted defendants often stem from contradictory theories of punishment. In {{the late twentieth}} century, courts traded rehabilitation for retributive ideals to fight the “War on Drugs. ” However, beginning with the Miami-Dade Drug Court, treatment and rehabilitation {{have returned to the}} forefront of sentencing policy in traditional and alternative drug courts. Jurisdictions have implemented a variety of policies designed to treat addiction as opposed to punishing it. <b>Community</b> <b>courts,</b> such as the Red Hook Community Justice Center in Brooklyn, New York, community-panel drug courts, such as the Woodbury County <b>Community</b> Drug <b>Court</b> in Iowa, and Hawaii’s Opportunity Probation with Enforcement represent efforts to address treatment within the <b>court</b> <b>system.</b> This Note argues that certain policies are more likely to benefit drug-addicted defendants than others, including procedural justice, predictable sanctions, and an increased focus on treatment.
