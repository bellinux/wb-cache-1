40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} maternal autonomy on <b>child</b> <b>schooling</b> outcomes in Ethiopia using a nationally representative Ethiopian Demographic and Health survey for 2011. The empirical strategy uses a Hurdle Negative Binomial Regression model to estimate years of schooling. An ordered probit model is also estimated to examine age grade distortion using a trichotomous dependent variable that captures three states of <b>child</b> <b>schooling.</b> The large sample size {{and the range of}} questions available in this dataset allow us to explore the influence of individual and household level social, economic and cultural factors on <b>child</b> <b>schooling.</b> The analysis finds statistically significant effects of maternal autonomy variables on <b>child</b> <b>schooling</b> in Ethiopia. The roles of maternal autonomy and other household-level factors on <b>child</b> <b>schooling</b> are important issues in Ethiopia, where health and education outcomes are poor for large segments of the population...|$|R

2500|$|Navajo lands were {{initially}} colonized by the Spanish {{in the early}} nineteenth century, shortly after this area was [...] "annexed" [...] as part of the Spanish colony of Mexico. When the United States acquired these territories in 1848 following the Mexicanâ€“American War, the English-speaking settlers allowed Navajo children to attend their schools. In some cases, the United States established separate schools for Navajo and other Native American children. In the late 19th century, it founded boarding schools, often operated by religious missionary groups. In efforts to acculturate the <b>children,</b> <b>school</b> authorities insisted that they learn to speak English and practice Christianity. Students routinely had their mouths washed out with lye soap as a punishment if they did speak Navajo. Consequently, when these students grew up and had children of their own, they often did not teach them Navajo, in order to prevent them from being punished.|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} fair trade (FT) affiliation on <b>child</b> <b>schooling</b> within a sample of Chilean honey producers with a retrospective panel data approach. From a theoretical point of view we argue that FT should {{have a positive effect}} on <b>child</b> <b>schooling</b> since it generates a short run pure income effect together with a medium run productivity effect on both adult and child wages. On the other hand, because of the higher productivity generated by the medium run effect, the opportunity cost of child education increases if they work with their parents. The direction of the impact of FT affiliation on <b>child</b> <b>schooling</b> is therefore uncertain and requires empirical testing. Our econometric findings document a positive and significant impact of affiliation years on <b>child</b> <b>schooling</b> after controlling for endogeneity and heterogeneity between the treatment and control sample...|$|R
