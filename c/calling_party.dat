25|$|The European market {{adopted a}} <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> pays model {{throughout}} the GSM environment and soon various other GSM markets also started to emulate this model.|$|E
25|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the receiving party pays systems is that phone owners keep their phones turned off to avoid receiving unwanted calls, {{which results in}} the total voice usage rates (and profits) in <b>Calling</b> <b>Party</b> Pays countries outperform those in Receiving Party Pays countries. To avoid the problem of users keeping their phone turned off, most Receiving Party Pays countries have either switched to <b>Calling</b> <b>Party</b> Pays, or their carriers offer additional incentives such as {{a large number of}} monthly minutes at a sufficiently discounted rate to compensate for the inconvenience.|$|E
25|$|Revertive pulsing (RP) worked {{faster than}} {{standard}} dial pulses, {{but the main}} advantage was in problem detection. In earlier systems, when a worn pawl or other problem in a Strowger selector caused it to fail to advance, only the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> could detect the error as no connection was achieved. The caller eventually lost patience and redialed the call. The same user or another might get connected to the faulty selector again. Therefore, one bad Strowger selector could block many calls until subscriber complaints alerted staff to the problem.|$|E
5000|$|Capabilities for the {{enhanced}} handling of <b>call</b> <b>party</b> connections (<b>Call</b> <b>Party</b> Handling) ...|$|R
5000|$|For example, the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> may {{indicate}} {{to the telephone}} exchange that the call is being disconnected by the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> by allowing loop current to flow in the line, or the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> indicates to the exchange that the call is being answered.|$|R
50|$|If {{the desired}} <b>called</b> <b>party</b> {{is not the}} person who picked up the call, and the desired <b>called</b> <b>party</b> is at an unknown location, the person who picked up the call may park the call and then use the public address system to page the desired <b>called</b> <b>party</b> {{to pick up the}} call.|$|R
2500|$|A {{telephone}} number {{serves as an}} address for switching telephone calls using a system of destination code routing. [...] Telephone numbers are entered or dialed by a <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> on the originating telephone set, which transmits the sequence of digits {{in the process of}} signaling to a telephone exchange. The exchange completes the call either to another locally connected subscriber or via the PSTN to the called party. Telephone numbers are assigned within the framework of a national or regional {{telephone number}}ing plan to subscribers by telephone service operators, which may be commercial entities, state-controlled administrations, or other telecommunication industry associations.|$|E
2500|$|When a <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> {{lifted the}} receiver, the local loop current lit a signal lamp near the jack. The {{operator}} responded by inserting the rear cord (answering cord) into the subscriber's jack and switched her headset into the circuit to ask, [...] "Number, please?" [...] For a local call, the operator inserted the front cord {{of the pair}} (ringing cord) into the called party's local jack and started the ringing cycle. For a long distance call, she plugged into a trunk circuit to connect to another operator in another bank of boards or at a remote central office. In 1918, the average time to complete the connection for a long-distance call was 15 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|... 400-service {{is called}} [...] "主被叫分摊付费业务" [...] (<b>calling</b> <b>party</b> and called party split-paid service), {{which means the}} <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> pays for the local access fee and the called party pays the toll (long distance) fee.|$|E
5000|$|When a long {{distance}} call is made to a <b>called</b> <b>party’s</b> wireline telephone, that party’s wireline local exchange carrier can charge the <b>calling</b> <b>party’s</b> {{long distance}} carrier an above-cost access charge for terminating the call; but if an identical long distance call were made to ths same <b>called</b> <b>party,</b> from and to the same physical location, but to the <b>called</b> <b>party’s</b> wireless telephone, the <b>called</b> <b>party’s</b> wireless carrier {{is not allowed to}} charge the <b>calling</b> <b>party’s</b> long distance carrier any access charge for terminating the call. Indeed, the average intercarrier compensation rate ranges from 0.1 cents per minute for traffic bound to an information service provider (“ISP”) to 5.1 cents per minute for intrastate traffic bound to a subscriber of a small (rural) incumbent local exchange carrier; individual rates can be as low as zero and as high as 35.9 cents per minute — even though in each case basically the same transport and switching functions are provided. (See CRS Report RL32889, Intercarrier Compensation: One Component of Telecom Reform, at pp. 2-5.) ...|$|R
50|$|Other uses {{might include}} placing the caller in queue {{to connect to}} the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> when the <b>called</b> <b>party's</b> line goes on-hook. Increasingly, the {{attendant}} function of a phone system is handled by an auto-attendant.|$|R
40|$|In {{competitive}} telecommunications markets each carrier {{relies on}} competing networks to terminate internetwork calls. Regulators typically require the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> network {{to pay a}} termination fee to the <b>called</b> <b>party's</b> network equal to the terminating network's "incremental cost" of completing the call, effectively imposing all of the costs on the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> network. These payments can affect retail prices and therefore consumption. I show that when both parties benefit from a call, they should bear its costs {{in proportion to the}} benefit they receive. Therefore, imposing all of the costs of an internetwork call on the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> network can be inefficient if these costs are reflected in the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> usage rates. A system in which two networks exchange traffic at specified points on a bill-and-keep basis imposes some of the cost on each network, which will then be imposed on the parties. This can generate more efficient network utilization, even with unbalanced traffic between networks. Thus, regulators may improve the efficiency of telecommunications markets by establishing bill-and-keep intercarrier compensation rules.

50|$|If the caller's {{wireline}} {{phone is}} connected {{directly to the}} <b>calling</b> <b>party,</b> when the caller takes their telephone off-hook, the calling party's phone will ring. This is called a hot line or ringdown. Otherwise, the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> is usually given a tone to indicate they should begin dialing the desired number. In some (now very rare) cases, if the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> cannot dial calls directly, they will be connected to an operator who places the call for them.|$|E
5000|$|Systems {{that provide}} <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> camp-on [...] the system {{facilities}} until the necessary facilities become available, and then proceed {{to complete the}} requested access. Such systems {{may or may not}} issue a system blocking signal to inform the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> of the access delay.|$|E

5000|$|After {{covering}} {{the cost of}} routing the call to its final destination, the terminating telco may {{share some of the}} remaining [...] "premium" [...] directly with the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> in a revenue share arrangement, or may use those monies to offset the cost of providing other services for the <b>called</b> <b>party.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{implementation}} of this feature is vendor-specific. In some cases, the ringer just does not ring and the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> is thus not alerted. Usually, though, the phone just acts as being busy. Depending on the infrastructure, the caller may {{end up on the}} <b>called</b> <b>party's</b> voice mailbox, sometimes after a certain delay.|$|R
50|$|With party-line service, {{particularly}} {{if there were}} more than two subscribers on the line, it was often necessary to complete a long-distance call through the operator to identify and correctly bill the <b>calling</b> <b>party.</b> In some cases, the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> would misidentify themselves in an attempt to send the bill to another party.|$|E

50|$|Some 911 Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) {{still use}} the MF format to {{identify}} the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> to the PSAP when processing calls from Mobile Telephone Switching Offices (MTSOs) and land telephone offices. This {{is based on an}} earlier system which used MF {{to identify the}} <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> to a feature group 'D' (101xxxx) alternate long distance provider.|$|E
50|$|Line {{signaling}} is a {{class of}} telecommunications signaling protocols. Line signaling is responsible for off-hook, ringing signal, answer, ground start, on-hook unidirectional supervision messaging in each direction from <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> to called party and vice versa. After an off-hook, line signaling initiates register signaling to accomplish the exchange of telephone numbers of called party and in more modern line-signaling protocols, the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> as well. While register signaling occurs, line signaling remains quiescent unless the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> goes on-hook or an abnormal cessation of the call occurs, such as due to equipment malfunction or shutdown or due to network outage upstream in that call-attempt's series of spanned trunks.|$|E

50|$|A {{conference call}} is a {{telephone}} call in which someone talks to several people at the same time. The conference calls may be designed to allow the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> to participate during the call, or the call may be set up so that the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> merely listens into the call and cannot speak. It is sometimes called ATC (audio tele-conference).|$|R
50|$|If the PSAP {{receives}} {{calls on}} older-style digital trunks, they are specially formatted Multi-Frequency (MF) trunks that pass the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> number (ANI) only. Some of the upgraded PSAPs can receive calls on ISUP trunks {{controlled by the}} SS7 protocol. In that case, the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> number (ANI) is already present in the SS7 setup message. The Charge Number Parameter contains the ANI.|$|R
5000|$|Now {{with the}} MSRN number, the GMSC {{knows how to}} route the call to reach the roaming cell phone. Then, the call is made using ISUP (or TUP) {{signaling}} between the GMSC and the visited MSC.
