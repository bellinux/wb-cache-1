25|$|Nixtamalized maize {{has several}} {{benefits}} over unprocessed grain: {{it is more}} easily ground; its nutritional value is increased; flavor and aroma are improved; and mycotoxins are reduced. Lime and ash are highly alkaline: the alkalinity helps the dissolution of hemicellulose, the major glue-like component of the maize cell walls, and loosens the hulls from the kernels and softens the maize. Some of the corn oil is broken down into emulsifying agents (monoglycerides and diglycerides), while bonding of the maize proteins to each other is also facilitated. The divalent calcium in lime acts as a <b>cross-linking</b> <b>agent</b> for protein and polysaccharide acidic side chains. As a result, while cornmeal made from untreated ground maize is unable by itself to form a dough on addition of water, the chemical changes in masa allow dough formation. These benefits make nixtamalization a crucial preliminary step for further processing of maize into food products, and the process is employed using both traditional and industrial methods, {{in the production of}} tortillas and tortilla chips (but not corn chips), tamales, hominy, and many other items.|$|E
2500|$|Evidence {{from studies}} of S. cerevisiae bear on the {{adaptive}} function of meiosis and recombination. [...] Mutations defective in genes essential for meiotic and mitotic recombination in S. cerevisiae cause increased sensitivity to radiation or DNA damaging chemicals. [...] For instance, gene rad52 is required for both meiotic recombination and mitotic recombination. [...] Rad52 mutants have increased sensitivity to killing by X-rays, Methyl methanesulfonate and the DNA <b>cross-linking</b> <b>agent</b> 8-methoxypsoralen-plus-UVA, and show reduced meiotic recombination. [...] These findings suggest that recombination repair during meiosis and mitosis is needed for repair of the different damages caused by these agents.|$|E

A new norbornenyl-functionalized castor oil alcohol (NCA) was synthesized and ring-opening metathesis copolymerized separately with two norbornene-based cross-linking agents: dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) and a bifunctional norbornene crosslinker (CL). Isothermal {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) {{was used to examine}} the cure behavior of NCA/DCPD and NCA/CL resins, through which a reasonable cure schedule was determined.

30|$|A {{wide variety}} of methods, {{including}} weave, mount, silk screen, polymer, and graft copolymerisation [2 – 7] are commonly and efficiently adopted to consolidate historic textiles. Among these, synthetic polymers {{have been widely used}} as consolidating agents [8 – 15] and adhesives [16 – 19] because of their good mechanical and bonding properties. However, there are some potential problems in the application of synthetic polymers in the conservation and restoration of historic silk. Synthetic polymers are high molecular weight compounds polymerized by low molecular weight monomers, whose molecular structures are quite different from silk protein. Therefore, they are chemically incompatible with silk textiles, and as such, {{attempts have been made to}} replace synthetic polymers with protein solutions and <b>cross-linking</b> <b>agents</b> [20 – 22]. <b>Cross-linking</b> <b>agents</b> often contain multiple functional groups or unsaturated double bonds. Improper <b>cross-linking</b> <b>agents</b> bring potential harm to historic silk as time elapses, considering their corrosion and toxicity. Thus, a more promising method is based on transglutaminase-mediated protein polymerisation as a compatible and innocuous method to reinforce historic silk fabrics.|$|R

50|$|Other {{advantages}} of monoliths conferred by their individual construction include greater column to column and batch to batch reproducibility.

50|$|Cross-links can {{be formed}} by {{chemical}} reactions that are initiated by heat, pressure, change in pH, or radiation.
