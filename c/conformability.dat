In this study, the physicalmechanical properties of pulp of kappa number 17 and 14, produced with modified cooks and with the application of AD(EO) D techniques for pulp of kappa 17 and DHT(EPO) DP for pulp of kappa 14 for the bleaching up to 90 % ISO, had been investigated. The main objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the physicalmechanical properties in pulps submitted to the bleaching sequences without oxygen in the beginning of the sequence. As references, cooks had been carried until numbers kappa 17 and 14, oxygen delignification and conventional bleaching for sequences A/D(EO) D for pulp of kappa 17 and DHT(EPO) DP for pulp of kappa 14. The alternative bleaching, without pre-O 2, resulted in bleached pulps with bigger integrity that of the reference, what it was confirmed by the values significantly higher of bulk, tear index, opacity and air resistance of the pulp weakly refined (for tissue papers). However, the high integrity of the fibers from pulps bleached with alternative processes lowered their <b>conformabilities</b> and collapsibility, with consequent reduction of tensile index of the pulp weakly refined. Therefore, with more intensive beating (for printing and writing papers), the tensile index was recovered. The high integrity of the bleaching pulps without pre-O 2 makes beating difficulty.

40|$|The {{intriguing}} {{world of}} microbiology is nowadays accessible for detailed exploration at a singleâmolecular level. Optical tweezers are a novel instrument {{that allows for}} nonâinvasive manipulation of single cells by the sole use of laser light and operates on the nanoâ and micrometer scale which corresponds to the same length scale as living cells. Moreover, forces {{within the field of}} microbiology are typically in the picoNewton range which is in accordance with the capability of force measuring optical tweezers systems. Both these <b>conformabilities</b> imply that force measuring optical tweezers is suitable for studies of single living cells. This thesis focuses on the mechanisms of bacterial attachments to host cells which constitute the first step in bacterial infection processes. Bacteria bind specifically to host receptors by means of adhesins that are expressed either directly on the bacterial membrane or on micrometerâlong adhesion organelles that are called pili. The properties of single adhesinâreceptor bonds that mediate adherence of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori are first examined at various acidities. Further on, biomechanical properties of P pili expressed by Escherichia coli are presented to which computer simulations, that capture the complex kinetics of the pili structure and precisely replicate measured data, are applied. Simulations are found to be a powerful tool for investigations of adhesive attributes of binding systems and are utilized in the analyses of the specific binding properties of P pili on a singleâpilus level. However, bacterial binding systems generally involve a multitude of adhesinâreceptor bonds. To explore bacterial attachments, the knowledge from singleâpilus studies is brought into a full multipili attachment scenario which is analyzed by means of theoretical treatments and simulations. The results are remarkable in several aspects. Not only is it found that the intrinsic properties of P pili are composed in an optimal combination to promote strong multipili bindings. The properties of the pili structure itself are also found to be optimized with respect to its in vivo environment. Indeed, the true meaning of the attributes derived at a singleâpilus level cannot be unraveled until a multipiliâbinding system is considered. Whereas detailed studies are presented for the helixâlike P pili expressed by Gramânegative Escherichia coli, conceptual studies are presented for the open coilâlike T 4 pili expressed by Gramâpositive Streptococcus pneumoniae. The structural and adhesive properties of these two types of pili differ considerably. These dissimilarities have farâreaching consequences on the adhesion possibilities at both singleâpilus and multipili levels which are discussed qualitatively. Moreover, error analyses of conventional data processing methods in dynamic force spectroscopy as well as development of novel analysis methods are presented. These findings provide better understanding of how to perform refined force measurements on single adhesion organelles as well as how to improve the analyses of measurement data to obtain accurate parameter values of biomechanical entities. In conclusion, this thesis comprises a study of bacterial adhesion organelles and the way they cooperate to establish efficient attachment systems that can successfully withstand strong external forces that acts upon bacteria. Such systems can resist, for instance, rinsing effects and thereby allow bacteria to colonize their host. By understanding the complexity, and thereby possible weaknesses, of bacterial attachments, new targets for combating bacterial infections can be identified...|$|R

The quantifications used a dynamometer for assessment of trackability (maximal strength) and flexibility (stiffness) and a 3 D optical gauging machine for assessment of <b>conformability</b> (distance between stent and arterial wall in a curvature). The maximal strength (measuring the trackability) ranged respectively from 0. 24 Â± 0. 06 and 0. 38 Â± 0. 03 N (Seaquest) to 1. 31 Â± 0. 42 and 1. 34 Â± 0. 35 N (Carbostent), concerning respectively curvatures of 90 Â° (P < 0. 0001) and 135 Â° (P < 0. 0001). The stiffness (measuring the flexibility) ranged from 0. 53 Â± 0. 16 (Seaquest) to 1. 28 Â± 0. 10 N/mm (NIR Royal; P < 0. 0001).

40|$|The Sphereprint is {{introduced}} {{as a means}} to characterize hemispherical <b>conformability,</b> even when buckling occurs, in a variety of flexible materials such as papers, textiles, nonwovens, films, membranes and biological tissues. <b>Conformability</b> is defined here as the ability to fit a doubly curved surface without folding. Applications of <b>conformability</b> range from the fit of a wound dressing, artificial skin, or wearable electronics around a protuberance such as a knee or elbow to geosynthetics used as reinforcements. <b>Conformability</b> of flexible materials is quantified by two dimensionless quantities derived from the Sphereprint. The Sphereprint ratio summarizes how much of the specimen conforms to a hemisphere under symmetric radial loading. The Coefficient of Expansion approximates the average stretching of the specimen during deformation, accounting for hysteresis. Both quantities are reproducible and robust, even though a given material folds differently each time it conforms. For demonstration purposes, an implementation of the Sphereprint test methodology was performed on a collection of cellulosic fibrous assemblies. For this example, the Sphereprint ratio ranked the fabrics according to intuition from least to most conformable in the sequence: paper towel, plain weave, satin weave, and single knit jersey. The Coefficient of Expansion distinguished the single knit jersey from the bark weave fabric, despite them having similar Sphereprint ratios and, as expected, the bark weave stretched less than the single knit jersey did during conformance. This work lays the foundation for engineers to quickly and quantitatively compare the conformance of existing and new flexible materials, no matter their construction...|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate stent mechanics in a curved vessel model by using Flat-Panel CT (FPCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The following stents were used: Neuroform 2, Neuroform Treo, Enter-prise, and LEO. All stents were bent in the same polytetrafluoroethylene tubes with various angles ranging from 150 Â° to 30 Â°. To visualize potential prolapse of the stent struts, 4 -, 5 -, and 8 -mm openings were created. FPCTs were obtained using a C-arm with flat detector. RESULTS: FPCT scans provided excellent visualization of deployment characteristics and stent me-chanics and was superior to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and digital radiography (DR). The Neuroform 2 /Treo showed, with increasing angle and diameter of the opening, a continuous increase in cell size. These stents also showed an outward prolapse at the convexity and an inwards prolapse of struts at the concavity of the curvature. The Enterprise showed an increasing trend to flatten and to kink with curvatures that are more acute. The LEO showed fewer trends to kink but an inward crimping of its ends with more acute angles.
