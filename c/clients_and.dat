Business was slow at first, but he gradually attracted a few <b>clients</b> <b>and</b> also represented his uncle Sardis in real estate litigation. In 1847, Hayes became ill with what his doctor thought to be tuberculosis. Thinking a change in climate would help, he considered enlisting in the Mexican–American War, but on his doctor's advice he instead visited family in New England. Returning from there, Hayes and his uncle Sardis made a long journey to Texas, where Hayes visited with Guy M. Bryan, a Kenyon classmate and distant relative. Business remained meager on his return to Lower Sandusky, and Hayes decided to move to Cincinnati.|$|E
5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in Europe, {{the collapse of}} papal authority in the Papal Schism allowed the Scottish Crown to gain effective control of major ecclesiastical appointments within the kingdom. This de facto authority over appointments was formally recognised by the Papacy in 1487. This led to the placement of <b>clients</b> <b>and</b> relatives of the king in key positions, including James IV's illegitimate son Alexander, who was nominated as Archbishop of St. Andrews {{at the age of}} 11, intensifying royal influence and also opening the Church to accusations of venality and nepotism. James IV used his pilgrimages to Tain and Whithorn to help bring the respective regions of Ross and Galloway, which lay on the edges of the kingdom, under royal authority. Relationships between the Scottish Crown and the Papacy were generally good, with James IV receiving tokens of papal favour. In 1472 St Andrews became the first archbishopric in the Scottish church, to be followed by Glasgow in 1492.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop an}} {{economic}} model that relaxes assumptions in Property Rights Theory {{to allow for}} investment in innovation that can benefit both <b>client</b> <b>and</b> vendor in an IT outsourcing relationship. Our model offers {{an explanation for the}} empirically observed heterogeneity in asset ownership structure. We find that optimal ownership structure can vary due to the different incentives of the <b>client</b> <b>and</b> vendor and differences in the available set of investment opportunities. We show that scenarios exist where the <b>client</b> <b>and</b> vendor agree on the ownership structure and others where they disagree. When investment in innovation enables new services and features then the client should retain ownership of the assets and when it leads to cost savings then the vendor should own the assets. The <b>client</b> <b>and</b> vendor disagree on the asset ownership structure when the investment opportunities yield similar levels of benefits to both vendor <b>and</b> <b>client.</b> In this case neither party wants to own the assets. When there are multiple investment opportunities, both <b>client</b> <b>and</b> vendor prefer to own the assets. We find that allowing renegotiation leads to different ownership preferences. In the absence of renegotiation, the <b>client</b> <b>and</b> vendor agree on the ownership structure in most cases, however when renegotiation is allowed, they always disagree on the ownership structure.
