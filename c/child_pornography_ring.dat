25|$|In March 2000, Willman {{helped the}} Royal Canadian Mounted Police {{with a child}} molestation case. Some time after August 2000, Willman {{anonymously}} provided to a private watchdog group documents related to a Kentucky state investigation of child molestation and production of child pornography. Prior to January 2001, the United States Customs Service contacted Willman to see whether he had discovered any useful information related to a suspected Russian <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{source of}} child {{pornography}} distributed worldwide is that created by sex tourists. Most {{of the victims of}} child sex tourism reside in the developing countries of the world. In 1996, a court in Thailand convicted a German national of child molestation and production of pornography for commercial purposes; he was involved in a <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> <b>ring</b> which exploited Thai children. A sizable portion of the pornography seized in Sweden and in the Netherlands in the 1990s was produced by sex tourists visiting Southeast Asia. INTERPOL works with its 190 member countries to combat the problem, and launched its first-ever successful global appeal for assistance in 2007 to identify a Canadian man, Christopher Paul Neil, featured in a series of around 200 photographs in which he was shown sexually abusing young Vietnamese and Cambodian children.|$|E
500|$|The {{publishers}} {{required that}} Vachss follow certain rules, including prohibiting the Batman character from killing, cursing, or having sex, and keeping {{a clear distinction}} between fiction and reality. For example, while Vachss wanted to write about Thailand, he created a fictional country named Udon Khai which had many similarities with Thailand — though Udon Khai is described as being dominated by a lone kingpin who controls the country's one-industry economy based on sex tourism while Thailand's tourism economy, which includes sex tourism, is part of an economic development strategy enabled by international development agencies. Vachss deviated from Batman canon by having the Wayne family butler, Alfred Pennyworth, reveal to Bruce Wayne that his mother, Martha, was a sociologist who was secretly investigating a <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> <b>ring.</b> In Vachss' novel, the Waynes were not the victims of a random crime; instead, Martha was targeted for assassination. One reviewer compared the characterization of Batman as [...] "the same brooding, handsome, rich character that Val Kilmer played [...] " [...] but with the [...] "gothic presence of the older Batman seen in 1940s movie serials". More complex analysis compared the story to an [...] "18th-century contes philosophiques in which the dark irrationality of the Greek gods has been flattened out into tidy didactic instruction." ...|$|E
25|$|Speculations of <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> <b>rings</b> or organ theft were offered, leading {{officials}} to also investigate possible {{links to the}} crimes of the French serial killer Michel Fourniret. Because Kampusch had carried her passport {{with her when she}} left (she had been on a family trip to Hungary a few days before), the police extended the search abroad. Accusations against Kampusch's family complicated the issue even more.|$|R
50|$|Gert van Rooyen and {{his lover}} Joey Haarhoff were {{suspected}} by the South African Police of abducting and murdering several young girls who disappeared between 1988 and 1990. In January 1990, van Rooyen killed Haarhoff and committed suicide during a police chase. In November 1991, van Rooyen's son Flippie van Rooyen {{was convicted of}} murdering a 15-year-old Zimbabwean girl during his military service. His death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1993. In 1997 he said the missing girls were killed during Satanic rituals and were the victims of international <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> <b>rings,</b> but no evidence of this was ever found. In 2001 {{he was sentenced to}} an additional six years' imprisonment for perjury for false statements he made about the missing girls. He was paroled in 2008. The whereabouts of the missing girls are still unknown.|$|R
50|$|Although Field of Chaos {{was written}} in 1993, it was copyrighted in 2010 and {{published}} in 2011. Barbalet provided a continued description of moving the writing {{from a series of}} text files into a published form through the Stone Ape podcasts in 2010. One of the running themes through the discussion of Field of Chaos is whether Julian Assange is a character in the writing. Although Barbalet initially denied the possibility, an account of hackers targeting a <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> internet <b>ring</b> and supplying this information to police (which features briefly in Field of Chaos) appears to have included Assange.|$|R

2500|$|One massive {{international}} <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> <b>ring</b> {{was centered}} in the Netherlands. [...] In the largest ever operation of its kind, police in 30 countries arrested 184 suspects and identified 486 others. Dutch authorities arrested 37-year-old Israeli-born Dutch citizen Amir Ish-Hurwitz, founder {{and owner of the}} internet forum Boylover.net, the center of the ring. At its peak, the forum had more than 70,000 members around the world.|$|E
2500|$|Organized {{crime is}} {{involved}} in the production and distribution of child pornography, which is found as a common element of organized crime profiles. Organized into groups to produce and distribute pornography, they are often called [...] "sex rings." [...] In 2003, an international police investigation uncovered a Germany-based <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> <b>ring</b> involving 26,500 suspects who swapped illegal images on the Internet in 166 different countries. In a 2006 case, US and international authorities charged 27 people in nine states and three countries in connection with a <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> <b>ring</b> that US federal authorities described as [...] "one of the worst" [...] they have discovered. The assistant secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement added that the case reflected three larger trends that are becoming more common in child pornography rings. One is the increasing prevalence of [...] "home-grown" [...] pornographic images that are produced by predators themselves, and include live streaming video images of children being abused, not just the circulation of repeated images. Another trend is the growing use of sophisticated security measures and of peer-to-peer networking, in which participants can share files with one another on their computers rather than downloading them from a web site. The group used encryption and data destruction software to protect the files and screening measures to ensure only authorized participants could enter the chat room. A third trend is the increasingly violent and graphic nature of the images involving the abuse of younger children.|$|E
5|$|At a party, Bruce Wayne meets Debra Kane, a {{caseworker}} with Child Protective Services. He asks to {{join her}} while she visits clients. She agrees and shows him the varying degrees of child abuse she encounters {{in the course of}} her job. Wanting to understand the factors behind child abuse, Bruce, as Batman, breaks into Hellgate Prison and talks with an informant who points him to a <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> and prostitution <b>ring.</b> Bruce's butler Alfred Pennyworth reveals that Bruce's mother, Martha Wayne, had been secretly investigating a similar child prostitution ring, and that the sex traffickers ordered the murders of Bruce's parents in order to silence her.|$|R
2500|$|Regarding {{internet}} proliferation, the U.S. Department of Justice {{states that}} [...] "At {{any one time}} there {{are estimated to be}} more than one million pornographic images of children on the Internet, with 200 new images posted daily." [...] They also note that a single offender arrested in the U.K. possessed 450,000 <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> images, and that a single <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> site received a million hits in a month. Further, that much of the trade in <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> takes place at hidden levels of the Internet, and that {{it has been estimated that}} there are between 50,000 and 100,000 paedophiles involved in organised <b>pornography</b> <b>rings</b> around the world, and that one third of these operate from the United States.|$|R
5000|$|The NCMEC {{estimated}} in 2003 that 20 {{percent of all}} pornography traded over the Internet was <b>child</b> <b>pornography,</b> and that since 1997 the number of <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> images available on the Internet had increased by 1500 percent. Regarding internet proliferation, the US DOJ states that [...] "At any one time there {{are estimated to be}} more than one million pornographic images of children on the Internet, with 200 new images posted daily." [...] They also note that a single offender arrested in the United Kingdom possessed 450,000 <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> images, and that a single <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> site received a million hits in a month.

Digital cameras and Internet distribution facilitated by the use of credit cards and the ease of transferring images across national borders has made it easier than ever before for users of <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> to obtain the photographs and videos.|$|R
2500|$|When cross-examined by the {{assistant}} prosecutor Jens Olav Sæther, the defendant {{made a series}} of claims which were described as [...] "bizarre". He claimed to be in possession of a mirror with apparent magical powers, for example the ability to grant physical protection from enemies or to compel an individual to [...] "confess" [...] bad deeds. He claimed that he had been stalked and harassed in his home-town of Ålesund by groups of local children who were under the direct influence of a prison inmate in Oslo. He said he had received violent threats from members of a <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> <b>ring.</b> When asked about his psychiatric evaluation, he claimed that the expert neuropsychiatrist who examined him, and concluded that he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, was in fact working as a belly dancer in his old neighborhood.|$|E
2500|$|Peter David brought two {{previously}} published characters, Sachs and Violens, into Fallen Angel in issue #19 of the DC Comics series. Co-owned by David and artist George Pérez, the characters had previously appeared {{in their own}} limited series from Marvel Comics's Epic imprint in 1993. Although the characters were owned by the creators, David says their appearance in Fallen Angel nearly didn't happen due to the legal costs involved. Co-creator George Pérez contributed covers to these issues. Sachs and Violens remained cast members in the series after it transferred to IDW Publishing. Juanita [...] "J.J."

[...] Mayor Alfredo Lim proceeded to crack down on Manila's remaining sex industry, causing many of these businesses to relocate to Angeles City, which borders on the closed base, and was becoming a popular tourist destination especially with former GI's.By the late 1990s, UNICEF estimated that there are 60,000 child prostitutes in the Philippines, describing Angeles City brothels as [...] "notorious" [...] for offering sex with children.In 1997, the BBC reported that UNICEF estimated many of the 200 brothels in the notorious Angeles City offer children for sex.
