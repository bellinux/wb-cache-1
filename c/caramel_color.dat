5000|$|In his {{presentation}} at the Society of Soft Drink Technologists Annual Meeting in 1970, Robert T. Linner mentioned that most <b>caramel</b> <b>colors</b> had log absorbance spectra which were essentially linear in the visible range. This means that such a spectrum could be characterized by a point (a log absorbance at some particular wavelength) and its slope. Because <b>caramel</b> <b>colors</b> have warm hues (i.e., greater absorbance for shorter wavelengths), the slopes of their log absorbance spectra will be negative. [...] is the negative of this slope, multiplied by a convenient factor.|$|R
