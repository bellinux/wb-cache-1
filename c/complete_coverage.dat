5|$|The most <b>complete</b> <b>coverage</b> of Engelbart's {{bootstrapping}} {{ideas can}} be found in Boosting Our Collective IQ, by Douglas C. Engelbart, 1995. This includes three of Engelbart's key papers, edited into book form by Yuri Rubinsky and Christina Engelbart to commemorate the presentation of the 1995 SoftQuad Web Award to Doug Engelbart at the World Wide Web conference in Boston in December 1995. Only 2,000 softcover copies were printed, and 100 hardcover, numbered and signed by Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee. Engelbart's book is now being republished by the Doug Engelbart Institute.|$|E
5|$|The Rockefeller Foundation {{offered an}} {{extension}} of Bethe's fellowship, allowing {{him to return to}} Italy in 1932. In the meantime, Bethe worked for Sommerfeld in Munich as a privatdozent. Since Bethe was fluent in English, Sommerfeld had Bethe supervise all his English-speaking postdoctoral fellows, including Lloyd P. Smith from Cornell University. Bethe accepted a request from Karl Scheel to write an article for the Handbuch der Physik on the quantum mechanics of hydrogen and helium. Reviewing the article decades later, Robert Bacher and Victor Weisskopf noted that it was unusual in the depth and breadth of its treatment of the subject, yet required very little updating for the 1959 edition. Bethe was then asked by Sommerfeld to help him with the handbuch article on electrons in metals. The article covered the basis of what is now called solid state physics. Bethe took a very new field and provided a clear, coherent and <b>complete</b> <b>coverage</b> of it. His work on the handbuch articles occupied {{most of his time in}} Rome, but he also co-wrote a paper with Fermi on another new field, quantum electrodynamics, describing the relativistic interactions of charged particles.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this pilot}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of palate-less dentures as a substitute for conventional <b>complete</b> palatal <b>coverage.</b> Ten edentulous patients who had recently received maxillary and mandibular complete dentures were included in the study. The patients' maxillary conventional dentures were duplicated to construct 'U' shape palate-less dentures. A strain gauge biting fork was used to compare the maximum biting force and chewing tests using almond were performed. They failed to show significant differences. Eight patients were more comfortable with the palate-less dentures than the <b>complete</b> palatal <b>coverage.</b> It was concluded that Palate-less dentures could be as effective as dentures with <b>complete</b> palatal <b>coverage.</b> King Saud Universit...|$|R

Rik Van Steenbergen of Belgium led in the bunch after a stage of 340km from Nancy. The first live {{coverage}} {{from the side of}} the road was from the Aubisque on 8 July 1958. Proposals to cover the whole race were abandoned in 1962 after objections from regional newspapers whose editors feared the competition. The dispute was settled but not in time and the first <b>complete</b> <b>coverage</b> was the following year. In 1958 the first mountain climbs were broadcast live on television for the first time, and in 1959 helicopters were first used for the television coverage.|$|E

500|$|Vacancy {{diffusion}} {{can occur}} as the predominant method of surface diffusion at high coverage levels approaching <b>complete</b> <b>coverage.</b> This process {{is akin to}} {{the manner in which}} pieces slide around in a [...] "sliding puzzle".

500|$|SCD would consist {{primarily}} {{of a single}} autonomous battery centered on a cut-down MAR called TACMAR (TACtical MAR), along with a simplified data processing system known as the Local Data Processor (LDP). This was essentially the DCDP with fewer modules installed, {{reducing the number of}} tracks it could compile and the amount of decluttering it could handle. To further reduce costs, Bell later replaced the cut-down MAR with an upgraded MSR, the [...] "Autonomous MSR". They studied a wide variety of potential deployments, starting with systems like the original Nike-X proposal with no SCDs, to deployments offering complete continental US protection with many SCD modules of various types and sizes. The deployments were arranged so that they could be built in phases, working up to <b>complete</b> <b>coverage.</b>|$|E
500|$|Barre wrote a {{work on the}} Bible {{entitled}} Compendium de veteri et novo testamento, {{which he}} dedicated to Longchamp. The work arranged passages from the Bible under topics, and then annotated the passages with marginal notations such as were done with glosses on Roman law. It is still extant in two manuscript (MS) copies, MS British Library Harley 3255, and Lambeth Palace MS 105. The Harley manuscript is shorter than the Lambeth manuscript. Richard Sharpe, a modern historian who studied both works, stated that the Harley manuscript [...] "provides [...] well structured and systematic (though not <b>complete)</b> <b>coverage</b> of the whole Bible." [...] Because of the dedication to William Longchamp as [...] "bishop, legate, and chancellor", {{it is likely that}} the work was composed between January 1190 and October 1191, as Longchamp only held those three offices together during that period. The prologue to the work describes it as something to be used privately, and thus Sharpe feels that it was not intended to be a publicly published work; instead Barre may have intended it for Longchamp's private use in preparing sermons.|$|E

40|$|In {{the recent}} years both {{software}} and hardware techniques have been adopted to carry out reliable designs, aimed at autonomously detecting the occurrence of faults, to allow discarding erroneous data and possibly performing {{the recovery of the}} system. The aim of this paper is the introduction of a combined use of {{software and hardware}} approaches to achieve a <b>complete</b> fault <b>coverage</b> in generic IP processors, with respect to SEU faults. Software techniques are preferably adopted to reduce the necessity and costs of modifying the processor architecture; since a <b>complete</b> fault <b>coverage</b> cannot be achieved, partial hardware redundancy techniques are then introduced to deal with the remaining, not covered, faults. The paper presents the methodological approach adopted to achieve the <b>complete</b> fault <b>coverage,</b> the proposed resulting architecture, and the experimental results gathered from the analysis of the fault injection campaigns...|$|R
