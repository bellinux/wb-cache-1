40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were: (1) to explore the domain of <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size of garments using a qualitative technique; (2) to develop scales, measuring them in the offline and online shopping contexts; and (3) to examine the relationships among body image self-discrepancy, body dissatisfaction, fashion involvement, <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size of garments, and loyalty intentions based on the self-discrepancy and cognitive dissonance theories.;In Phase 1, the domain of <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size of garments was explored using a focus group interview technique. Results of this phase revealed seven distinct, interrelated themes, encompassing both offline and online shopping.;In Phase 2, based on the findings from Phase 1, two <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size of garment scales were developed for offline and online shopping. As a result of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, five dimensions, including 22 items, were identified for each of the offline and online shopping contexts. It appeared that both offline and online shopping contexts generated similar <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size of garments to some extent, but at the same time, the <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size in the two different shopping formats were explained by somewhat different dimensions.;In Phase 3, a hypothesized model, examining the relationships among body image self-discrepancy, body dissatisfaction, enduring and situational fashion involvement, <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size of garments, and loyalty intentions, was tested using a SEM technique. The results showed that body image self-discrepancy was positively related to body dissatisfaction. Body dissatisfaction was positively related to enduring and situational fashion involvement. Body dissatisfaction was positively associated <b>with</b> five <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size of garment dimensions. However, the relationships between enduring and situational fashion involvement and five <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size of garment dimensions were not significant. Finally, <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> overall appearance and <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> unavailability of size did not influence loyalty intentions; whereas, <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> imagining fit/size in online shopping negatively affected loyalty intentions...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{theories}} of self-interest cannot predict when individuals pursue relative and absolute economic outcomes in interdependent decision-making, but {{we argue that}} regulatory focus (Higgins, 1997) can. We propose that a <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> security (prevention focus) motivates <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> social status, leading to the regulation of relative economic outcomes, but a <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> growth (promotion focus) motivates the maximization of opportunities, leading to a focus on absolute outcomes. Two studies supported our predictions; regardless of prosocial or proself motivations, a promotion focus yielded greater <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> absolute outcomes, but a prevention focus yielded greater <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> relative outcomes. Also, Study 3 revealed that a prevention focus led to a greater rejection of a negative relative but positive absolute outcome in an ultimatum game because of <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> status. This research reveals that apparently opposing orientations to interdependence – equality and relative gain – serve the same self-regulatory purpose: the establishment of security...|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of this study was to}} examine the relationships among body-related self-discrepancy, body dissatisfaction, apparel involvement, <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size of garments, and purchase intentions based on self-discrepancy theory. A random sample of college female students (n = 348) was drawn from a Midwestern university. The data was collected using a web-based survey. A hypothesized model was tested using the SEM technique. The results indicated that consumers’ perceived body-related self-discrepancy from online models had a direct relationship with body dissatisfaction. Consumers with higher enduring apparel involvement tended to feel a higher degree of body dissatisfaction. Body dissatisfaction was positively related to five <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size of garment dimensions. Enduring apparel involvement was negatively related to <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> overall appearance and <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> imagining fit/size in online shopping. Finally, two of the <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> fit and size of garment dimensions (<b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> overall appearance and <b>concerns</b> <b>with</b> imagining fit/size in online shopping) were negatively related to purchase intentions. Keywords body-related self-discrepancy, fit, online shopping Since the mid- 20 th century, cultural standards for the ideal body have generated discrepancies between the actual and ideal self in many societies around the world. Unrealistic standards are often used as criteria for evaluating one’s body (Jung, Lennon, & Rudd, 2001).

Our findings show that trade unions are not the first choice recipient for workers who want to raise a concern about wrongdoing. Workers tend to raise a <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> other recipients first, if they raise their <b>concern</b> at all <b>with</b> a union. Our findings suggest that it is safer for a whistleblower to raise a <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> a union than it is with other recipients.
