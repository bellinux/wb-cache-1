5|$|A {{revised version}} of the game was resubmitted to the ACB and {{reclassified}} as MA 15+ on August 7, 2008, or not suitable for people {{under the age of}} 15 unless accompanied by a parent or adult guardian; this new rating ensured that the game could retail legally in Australia. According to the ACB board report, the drug <b>content</b> <b>was</b> not removed entirely from the {{revised version of}} the game, but the animation showing the actual usage of the drugs was removed; the minority view on the decision stated that the drug <b>content</b> <b>was</b> still enough to warrant a refused classification rating.|$|E

5|$|In July 2010, Conroy delayed {{implementing}} the plan pending a 12-month review into how refused classification <b>content</b> <b>was</b> rated. The proposal {{is not expected}} to go forward due to the opposition from The Coalition and the Greens. Internet service providers Telstra and Optus have both agreed to voluntarily block some content.|$|E
5|$|Its Linpack {{performance}} {{stands at}} 80 TeraFLOPs, {{which is about}} half {{as fast as the}} cut-off line for the Top 500 Supercomputers list. According to Rennie, all <b>content</b> <b>was</b> stored in Watson's RAM for the Jeopardy game because data stored on hard drives would be too slow to be competitive with human Jeopardy champions.|$|E

5|$|Warner Bros. {{partnered with}} several {{retailers}} and companies globally to provide bonus content {{as a reward}} for pre-ordering, including: Best Buy, Amazon.com, GameStop, Game, Gamestation, EB Games, Tesco, and Asda. The <b>content</b> <b>was</b> only made available by pre-ordering the game with a specific retailer or purchasing a product, such as a NOS beverage, to obtain an unlockable code.|$|E
5|$|Wipeout HD was {{developed}} by Sony Studio Liverpool, who had desired to release a game for the PlayStation store to stress that downloadable <b>content</b> <b>was</b> not reserved for smaller games. The game was delayed {{for a few months}} due to reports of it failing epilepsy tests.|$|E
5|$|A Message from Earth (AMFE) is {{a high-powered}} digital radio signal {{that was sent}} on 9 October 2008 towards Gliese 581c, a large {{terrestrial}} extrasolar planet orbiting the red dwarf star Gliese 581. The signal is a digital time capsule containing 501 messages that were selected through a competition on the social networking site Bebo. The message was sent using the RT-70 radar telescope of Ukraine's State Space Agency. The signal will reach the planet Gliese 581c in early 2029. More {{than half a million}} people including celebrities and politicians participated in the AMFE project, which was the world's first digital time capsule where the <b>content</b> <b>was</b> selected by the public.|$|E

Rajamouli added that a database of IP addresses of non-resident Indians who frequently download <b>content</b> <b>was</b> shared with immigration authorities which could affect their potential US residence permit applications. The anti-piracy cell delinked more than 2,000 links to the pirated versions of Naan Ee on the Internet.|$|E
5|$|According to Stephen Shaw, most of Mysteries of the Siths <b>content</b> <b>was</b> {{inspired}} by Timothy Zahn's Thrawn trilogy of books; {{one of the}} game's protagonists, Mara Jade, was drawn directly from the novels. Though the expansion includes characters from the previous game, new dialogue was recorded for Mysteries of the Siths scenario, including recurring background characters who speak similar lines to their counterparts in Dark Forces II. Some dialogue was authentically translated into Huttese, a fictional language used in Return of the Jedi {{and elsewhere in the}} Star Wars universe. The Star Wars original soundtrack by John Williams is used in Mysteries of the Sith.|$|E
5|$|After {{the events}} of the 2011 Tōhoku {{earthquake}} and tsunami disrupted the development schedule for downloadable content for Fate of Two Worlds, the additional <b>content</b> <b>was</b> created into a standalone title, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, for a discounted retail price. The game received generally positive reviews upon release; critics praised the expanded character roster and improved online experience, but criticized the lack of new features and game modes. A sequel, titled , was released in September 2017.|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the effect of autoclaving, toasting and cooking processes on raw hatchery waste with shell and without shell. Average crude protein contents of hatchery waste meal (with shell) were 18. 17 % due to cooking and 16. 83 % due to toasting. Crude fibre <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> the lowest under cooking process. Crude fat <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> reduced to 11. 44 % by autoclaving. Total ash <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> increased substantially during all treatments. Calcium <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> reduced to 20 % due to autoclaving. Nitrogen Free Extract (NFE) contents and metabalizable energy <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> significantly modified. Average crude protein contents of hatchery waste meal (without shell) and crude fat <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> significantly increased (P< 0. 01) under respective processes. Total ash <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> reduced due to removal of egg shell. Calcium and phosphorus <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> also reduced significantly due to removal of eggshell. NFE <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> markedly reduced when there were no eggshell. Energy <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> significantly increased when there were no eggshell. Overall, results of hatchery waste without shell were better than with shell. However, hatchery waste meal with shell is rich source of calcium. Within processing, there were non-significant differences for all nutrients with no Salmonella and E. coli Average acid values of cooked hatchery waste meal were increased significantly (P< 0. 01) from 3. 04 to 7. 88 after 9 months of storage. Amino acid profile of unprocessed hatchery waste (with shell), cooked processed waste with and without shell revealed sufficient quantity of all essential amino acids, particularly cooked processed hatchery waste (without shell) contained the higher levels of lysine and methionine...|$|R

5|$|Authentic Science Fiction was a British {{science fiction}} {{magazine}} {{published in the}} 1950s that ran for 85 issues under three editors: Gordon Landsborough, H.J. Campbell, and E.C. Tubb. The magazine was published by Hamilton and Co., and began in 1951 {{as a series of}} novels appearing every two weeks; by the summer it became a monthly magazine, with readers' letters and an editorial page, though fiction <b>content</b> <b>was</b> still restricted to a single novel. In 1952 short fiction began to appear alongside the novels, and within two more years it completed the transformation into a science fiction magazine.|$|E
5|$|Blue Shift {{returns the}} player to Half-Lifes Black Mesa {{timeline}} once more, {{this time as}} Barney Calhoun, one of the facility's security guards. The expansion was originally developed as a bonus mission for the canceled Dreamcast version. Blue Shift came with the High Definition Pack, that gave the player the option to update the look of Half-Life, Opposing Force, and the new Blue Shift content. Blue Shift had relatively little new content compared to Opposing Force: aside from a few variations on existing models, all <b>content</b> <b>was</b> already present in the original Half-Life.|$|E
5|$|Bomis created Nupedia {{as a free}} online {{encyclopedia}} (with content {{submitted by}} experts) {{but it had a}} tedious, slow review process. Wikipedia was initially launched by Bomis to provide content for Nupedia, and was a for-profit venture (a Bomis subsidiary) through the end of 2002. As the costs of Wikipedia rose with its popularity, Bomis' revenues declined as result of the dot-com crash. Since Wikipedia was a drain on Bomis' resources, Wales and philosophy graduate student Larry Sanger decided to fund the project as a charity; Sanger was laid off from Bomis in 2002. Nupedia <b>content</b> <b>was</b> merged into Wikipedia, and it ceased in 2003.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this survey is on {{research}} in applying evolutionary and other metaheuristic search algorithms to automatically generating content for games, both digital and non-digital (such as board games). The term search-based procedural <b>content</b> generation <b>is</b> proposed as the name for this emerging field, which at present is growing quickly. A taxonomy for procedural <b>content</b> generation <b>is</b> devised, centering {{on what kind of}} <b>content</b> <b>is</b> generated, how the <b>content</b> <b>is</b> represented and how the quality/fitness of the <b>content</b> <b>is</b> evaluated; search-based procedural content generation in particular is situated within this taxonomy. This article also contains a survey of all published papers known to the authors in which game <b>content</b> <b>is</b> generated through search or optimisation, and ends with an overview of important open research problems...|$|R

5|$|Director Reeves {{featured}} many {{scenes of}} intense onscreen torture and violence that were considered unusually sadistic at the time. Upon its theatrical release throughout {{the spring and}} summer of 1968, the movie's gruesome <b>content</b> <b>was</b> met with disgust by several film critics in the UK, despite having been extensively censored by the British Board of Film Censors. In the US, the film was shown virtually intact and was a box office success, but it was almost completely ignored by reviewers.|$|E
5|$|Frankenstein, MD is a 2014 American Gothic horror comedy webseries with {{transmedia}} elements. Produced {{in partnership}} between Pemberley Digital and PBS Digital Studios, {{the show is}} a modern adaptation of Frankenstein by Mary Shelley, replacing the eponymous character with Victoria Frankenstein, a medical student near graduation. The show, which represents PBS Digital's first foray into scripted <b>content,</b> <b>was</b> created by Bernie Su, Brett Register, and Lon Harris and premiered on YouTube on August 19, 2014.

5|$|In 1840 a {{group of}} local {{businessmen}} led by Jonathan Richardson set up {{the first of several}} iron companies in Consett (County Durham), the Derwent Iron Company, to quarry and smelt ironstone around the town. The best local ironstone (with the highest iron <b>content)</b> <b>was</b> exhausted soon after, so the company arranged for extensions to the local railways, such as the Stockton and Darlington Railway. These allowed it to access new sources of ironstone, including, from 1851 onwards, ore from the Cleveland Ironstone Formation near Eston, Cleveland.|$|E
