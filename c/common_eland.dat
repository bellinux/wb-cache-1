5|$|Three {{subspecies}} of <b>common</b> <b>eland</b> {{have been}} recognized, though their validity {{has been in}} dispute.|$|E
5|$|Mainly a herbivore, its diet is {{primarily}} grasses and leaves. Common elands form herds {{of up to}} 500 animals, but are not territorial. The <b>common</b> <b>eland</b> prefers habitats {{with a wide variety}} of flowering plants such as savannah, woodlands, and open and montane grasslands; it avoids dense forests. It uses loud barks, visual and postural movements and the flehmen response to communicate and warn others of danger. The <b>common</b> <b>eland</b> is used by humans for leather, meat, and rich, nutritious milk, and has been domesticated in many areas.|$|E
5|$|The Bovidae family {{ancestors}} of the <b>common</b> <b>eland</b> evolved approximately 20 million years ago in Africa; fossils are found throughout Africa and France but the best record appears in sub-Saharan Africa. The first members of the tribe Tragelaphini appear 6 million years in the past during the late Miocene. An extinct ancestor of the <b>common</b> <b>eland</b> (Taurotragus arkelli) appears in the Pleistocene in northern Tanzania and the first T. oryx fossil appears in the Holocene in Algeria.|$|E

500|$|Housing <b>common</b> <b>elands</b> is {{difficult}} {{due to their}} ability to jump over fences as high as [...] or simply break through using their substantial mass. Sometimes, wild eland will break through enclosures to mix with domesticated ones. <b>Common</b> <b>elands</b> can reproduce in captivity, but calf survival is low and the young may need to be separated from their mothers to ensure health and adequate feeding. Husbandry requires care because the generally placid animals startle easily and require large amounts of space.|$|R
5|$|<b>Common</b> <b>elands</b> are nomadic and crepuscular. They eat in {{the morning}} and evening, rest in shade when hot and remain in {{sunlight}} when cold. They are commonly found in herds of up to 500, with individual members remaining in the herd anywhere from several hours to several months. Juveniles and mothers tend to form larger herds, while males may separate into smaller groups or wander individually. During estrus, mainly in the rainy season, groups tend to form more regularly. In southern Africa <b>common</b> <b>elands</b> will often associate with herds of zebras, roan antelopes and oryxes.|$|R
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} <b>common</b> <b>eland</b> is Taurotragus oryx, composed of three words: tauros, tragos and oryx. Tauros is Greek for a bull or bullock, meaning {{the same as the}} Latin taurus. Tragos is Greek for a male goat, referring to the tuft of hair that grows in the eland's ear and its resemblance to a goat's beard. Oryx is Latin and Greek (generally orygos) for pickaxe, referring to the pointed horns of North African antelopes like the <b>common</b> <b>eland</b> and scimitar-horned oryx.|$|E
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>eland</b> is {{sometimes}} farmed and hunted for its meat, {{and in some}} cases can be better used than cattle because it is more suited to African climates. This has led to some Southern African farmers switching from cattle to eland. Common elands are also pictured as supporters in the coat of arms of Grootfontein, Namibia.|$|E
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>eland</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1766 by the German zoologist and botanist Peter Simon Pallas. It {{belongs to the}} order Artiodactyla, family Bovidae and subfamily Bovinae. Common elands are sometimes {{considered part of the}} genus Tragelaphus on the basis of molecular phylogenetics, but are usually categorized as Taurotragus, along with the giant eland (T. derbianus).|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Shava is {{the name}} of the eland in ChiShona. The colour of these <b>common</b> <b>elands</b> is lighter than that of the giant elend above; so the colour is shavane or Shavani hence Zvishavane.|$|R
50|$|The prey menus of tiger and lion are similar. The South China tigers prey on blesboks (Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi), springboks (Taurotragus oryx), gemsboks (Oryx gazella), black {{wildebeest}} (Connochaetes gnou), blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), <b>common</b> <b>elands</b> (Taurotragus oryx), impalas (Aepyceros melampus), waterbucks (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), common warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) {{and cape}} hares (Lepus capensis).|$|R
5|$|<b>Common</b> <b>elands</b> live on {{the open}} plains of {{southern}} Africa and along {{the foothills of the}} great southern African plateau. The species extends north into Ethiopia and most arid zones of South Sudan, west into eastern Angola and Namibia, and south to South Africa. However, there is a low density of elands in Africa due to poaching and human settlement.|$|R
5|$|Currently, common elands are not endangered. They are conserved by the United States Endangered Species Act, and {{regulated}} {{in international trade}} by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Using ground counts and aerial surveys, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) calculates the population density of the <b>common</b> <b>eland</b> to be between 0.05 and 1 per square kilometre with a total population estimate of 136,000. Populations are considered stable or increasing in the countries of Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Malawi and possibly Tanzania.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN {{states that}} about half of the {{estimated}} total population lives in protected areas and 30% on private land. Protected areas that support major populations include Omo (Ethiopia), Serengeti, Katavi, Ruaha and Selous-Kilombero (Tanzania), Kafue and North Luangwa (Zambia), Nyika (Malawi), Etosha (Namibia), Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (Botswana/South Africa) and Ukhahlamba Drakensberg Park (South Africa). Most of these populations appear to be stable. Relatively large numbers of <b>common</b> <b>eland</b> now live on private land, particularly in Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, reflecting its value as a trophy animal. Common elands have also been widely domesticated in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Kenya, as well as in Russia and Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|Male elands {{and female}} greater kudus {{can produce a}} viable male hybrid, {{though it is not}} known if it is sterile. An {{accidental}} crossing of an east African <b>common</b> <b>eland</b> (T. o. pattersonianus) with an east African kudu (T. s. bea) occurred in the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. This was believed to be due to the absence of male kudus in the herd. The hybrid produced was sterile, which was unexpected before the study. The study conformed the chromosome numbers of both the eland and the kudu and the strangeness of their attached Y chromosomes. Reports state that repeated matings of male elands with domestic (Bos primigenius) and zebu cows (Bos indicus) have also produced sterile hybrids. Female elands can also act as surrogates for bongos.|$|E

25|$|The two eland {{species are}} now semi-domesticated as their docile dispositions, large {{quantities}} of meat, and resilience in Africa's harsh environments has made them ideal alternatives to cattle in some parts in Africa. In a 2014 comparison between the quality of meat from <b>common</b> <b>eland</b> and cattle, {{it was found that}} the meat from male elands was low-fat and more beneficial for human nutritional health but it lacks the sensory texture and flavor that makes cattle meat so appealing to consumers. In addition to being on farm as exotic lifestock, eland as well as the other species of spiral-horned antelope have also been brought to private game reserves across the planet (in particular parts in North America and Africa) for recreational hunting. Unlike eland however, most of the other species are not as docile or tolerant of humans as they avoid any contact as possible.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 25,000 large animals, mostly ungulates, {{live in the}} crater. Large {{animals in}} the crater include the black {{rhinoceros}} (Diceros bicornis), the local population of which declined from about 108 in 1964-66 to between 11-14 in 1995, the African buffalo or Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer), and the hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius). There also are many other ungulates: the blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) (7,000 estimated in 1994), Grant's zebra (Equus quagga boehmi) (4,000), the <b>common</b> <b>eland</b> (Taurotragus oryx), and Grant's (Nanger granti) and Thomson's gazelles (Eudorcas thomsonii) (3,000). Waterbucks (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) occur mainly near Lerai Forest. There are no topis (Damaliscus lunatus), oribis (Ourebia oribi), or crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus). Impala (Aepyceros melampus) are absent because the open woodland they prefer does not exist. Giraffe also are absent, possibly {{because of a lack}} of browse species. Tanzanian cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus raineyi), East African wild dog (Lycaon pictus lupinus), and African leopard (Panthera pardus pardus) are rarely seen.|$|E

500|$|The <b>common</b> <b>eland</b> (Taurotragus oryx), {{also known}} as the {{southern}} eland or eland antelope, is a savannah and plains antelope found in East and Southern Africa. It is a species of the family Bovidae and genus Taurotragus. It was first described by Peter Simon Pallas in 1766. An adult male is around 1.6metres (5') tall at the shoulder (females are 20centimetres (8") shorter) and can weigh up to [...] with an average of , [...] for females). It is the second largest antelope in the world, being slightly smaller on average than the giant eland.|$|E
2500|$|The Gaborone Game Reserve is a [...] park east of {{the city}} on Limpopo Drive. The reserve was built in 1988 {{and is now the}} third-busiest in Botswana.

The park is a {{destination}} for [...] birdwatching. Birds in the marshy section of the park include snake eagles, boubou, gallinule, kingfishers, and hornbills.|$|E
2500|$|The Mokolodi Nature Reserve is a [...] reserve {{that was}} created in 1994. It is located [...] south of Gaborone. There are many {{different}} species of animals found in the park such as common warthogs, steenbok, kudu, zebras, giraffes, <b>common</b> <b>eland,</b> ostriches, hippos and rhinos. The park helps with wildlife projects in Botswana that include: the reintroduction of the white rhino and the relocation of “problem” cheetahs. Mokolodi also holds the Education Centre, which teaches children about the conservation projects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>elands</b> are spiral-horned antelopes. They {{are sexually}} dimorphic, with females being {{smaller than the}} males. Females weigh 300 - 600 kg, measure 200 - 280 cm from the snout {{to the base of}} the tail and stand 125 - 153 cm at the shoulder. Bulls weigh 400 - 942 kg, are 240 - 345 cm from the snout {{to the base of the}} tail and stand 150 - 183 cm at the shoulder. The tail is 50 - 90 cm long. Male elands can weigh up to 1000 kg.|$|R
5|$|<b>Common</b> <b>elands</b> are herbivores that browse during drier {{winter months}} but have also adapted to grazing {{during the rainy}} season when grasses are more common. They require a high-protein diet of {{succulent}} leaves from flowering plants but will consume lower quality plant material if available including forbs, trees, shrubs, grasses, seeds and tubers. The eland can conserve water by increasing its body temperature. Grasses the eland eats include Setaria and Themeda and fruits from Securinega and Strychnos. Large antelope can survive on lower quality food in times of little rain. Elands feed during the night in hot weather and sleep for long periods during the day.|$|R
500|$|<b>Common</b> <b>elands</b> have a mild {{temperament}} {{and have been}} successfully domesticated for meat and milk production in South Africa and Russia. Their need for water is quite low because they produce urine with a high-urea content, but they require a substantial grazing area, along with salt licks and large amounts of supplementary foods like maize, sorghum, melons and beans which can be expensive. A female can produce up to [...] of milk per day that is richer in milkfat than cow milk. The pleasant-tasting milk has a butterfat content of 11-17% and can be stored for up to eight months if properly prepared, versus several days for cow milk.|$|R

The hybridization of these species adds further support in the bongo and sitatunga being each other's closet relatives. Other hybrids have been documented, such as a male <b>common</b> <b>eland</b> x greater kudu resulting from an accidental crossing from the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in the 1970s. Notable mixed inherited traits were pointed ears as the eland's, but a bit widened like kudu's. The tail was half the length of that of an eland, with a terminal tuft of hair as in kudu. The individual was, however, azoospermic as analysis showed that it completely lacked germ cells, which produce gametes.|$|E
2500|$|Russian {{zoologist}} [...] Peter Simon Pallas introduced [...] "oryx" [...] into {{scientific literature}} in 1767, applying {{the name to}} the <b>common</b> <b>eland</b> as Antilope oryx (Pallas, 1767). In 1777, he transferred the name to the Cape gemsbok. At the same time, he also described {{what is now called}} the Arabian oryx as Oryx leucoryx, giving its range as [...] "Arabia, and perhaps Libya". In 1816, Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville subdivided the antelope group, adopted Oryx as a genus name, and changed the Antilope oryx of Pallas to Oryx gazella (de Blainville, 1818). In 1826, Martin Lichtenstein confused matters by transferring the name Oryx leucoryx to the scimitar-horned oryx (now Oryx dammah) which was found in the Sudan by the German naturalists Wilhelm Friedrich Hemprich and Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg (Lichtenstein, 1826). The Arabian oryx was then nameless until the first living specimens in Europe were donated to the Zoological Society of London in 1857. Not realizing this might be the Oryx leucoryx of previous authors, Dr. John Edward Gray proposed calling it Oryx beatrix after HRH the Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom (Gray, 1857). Though this name was to persist for many years, Oldfield Thomas renamed the scimitar-horned oryx as Oryx algazal in 1903 (it has since been renamed Oryx dammah), and gave the Arabian oryx back its original name. The confusion between the two species has been exacerbated because both have been called white oryx in English.|$|E

5|$|<b>Common</b> <b>elands</b> are {{resistant}} to trypanosomiasis, a protozoan infection that has the tsetse fly as a vector, {{but not to the}} Rhipicephalus-transmitted disease theileriosis. The disease-causing bacteria Theileria taurotragi has caused many eland deaths. Clostridium chauvoei, another bacterium, can be harmful as well. Eland are also hosts to several kinds of ticks. In one study an eland was found to be host to the Amblyomma species A. gemma and A. variegatum, and Rhipicephalus species R. decoloratus, R. appendiculatus, R. evertsi, R. pulchellus and R. pravus. Elands produce antibodies for Brucella bacteria, but none for Mycobacterium paratuberculosis or various types of pneumonia like contagious bovine pneumonia and contagious caprine pneumonia, normally infectious in cows or antelopes.|$|R
