40|$|Two {{types of}} {{spoilage}} in <b>cooked</b> <b>hams</b> were investigated. One {{was a result}} of the growth of Weissella viridescens, which produces cavities in the muscles of hams after cooking. The origin of W. viridescens was shown to be the brine used in the preparation of the ham. After its production, the brine is usually left at room temperature for several hours before being cooled and used, allowing the growth of the microorganism. The second types of spoilage is because of Lactobacillus sakei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc carnosum, which grew during the 4 - 6 °C storage period of <b>cooked</b> <b>hams</b> packaged under vacuum. The spoilage consisted of the production of various molecules such as hydrocarbons, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, alcohols, esters and sulphur compounds.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{addition}} of pork haem pigment on the colour, colour stability and texture of <b>cooked</b> <b>hams</b> from pale, soft and exudative meat (PSE hams) was studied. A total of 62 hams were selected at 15 h post mortem {{on the basis of}} pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and L * value in semimembranosus (SM) and biceps femoris (BF) muscles. Hams were divided into three groups to be manufactured as cooked hams: group 1 (control, with normal meat quality hams, n 20), group 2 (control, with PSE hams, n 21) and group 3 (with PSE hams to which 0. 04 % of pork haem pigment was added, n 21). The stability of the colour (L*, a*, b*) was followed at 0, 30 and 120 min after slicing. Pigment content and the instrumental texture of the hams were also evaluated. L * value after slicing was lower in group 3 than in group 2 for both muscles at all three times studied. Colour a * value (redness) was significantly higher for group 3 than for groups 1 and 2 at the three times and in the two muscles. Accordingly, there was an increase in visual redness in BF and SM of hams from group 3 with respect to groups 1 and 2. Iri-descence was higher in PSE hams. The muscle pigment content showed no significant differences among groups – neither in the fresh nor in the <b>cooked</b> <b>hams.</b> No {{effect of the}} pork pigment was found on the texture properties studied.

The two ham types differed in lipid oxidation odourants: polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) derivatives hexanal, 1 -octen- 3 -one and (E,E) - 2, 4 -decadienal were higher in LI ham; while monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) derivative decanal was higher in HI. HI samples resulted in higher values for odour-active aroma compounds from Maillard reaction, which are related to roast flavour and a higher overall flavour liking.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse pig muscles used in the {{production}} of <b>cooked</b> <b>hams</b> with a view to the occurrence of PSE-type defects and their potential effect on the frequency of destructured zones in finished products. One hundred and six samples of m. adductor (AD) and m. semimembranosus (SM) pig muscles were studied. The two kinds of muscle differed from each other in terms of their pH values and colour (L⁎: lightness, a⁎: redness, and b⁎: yellowness); these differences between the two categories were statistically significant (P< 0. 001). The AD muscles were divided into meat with PSE (pale, soft, and exudative) defects and non-PSE meat by sensory examination. A total of 44. 3 % of AD muscles showed PSE defects. Lightness L⁎ fell within a range of 50. 68 – 55. 23 in non-PSE meat (AD) and was statistically significantly lower (P< 0. 001) than in PSE meat (56. 25 – 58. 78).

During monoculture experiments in <b>cooked</b> <b>ham</b> simulation medium, Leuc. carnosum 3 M 42 converted the available glucose into lactic acid and ethanol, whereas the two other strains produced additional metabolites such as acetic acid and 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol. When grown in co-culture, Leuc. carnosum 3 M 42 suppressed the growth and metabolism of B. thermosphacta RMS 6. In contrast, a co-culture of the latter bacterium with C. divergens 3 M 14 led to a variety of spoilage-related metabolic compounds.

40|$|AbstractIn this {{preliminary}} investigation, different commercial categories of Italian cooked pork hams have been characterized using an integrated approach based on both sensory and fast instrumental measurements. For these purposes, Italian products belonging to different categories (<b>cooked</b> <b>ham,</b> “selected” <b>cooked</b> <b>ham</b> and “high quality” <b>cooked</b> <b>ham)</b> {{were evaluated by}} sensory descriptive analysis and by the application of rapid tools such as image analysis by an “electronic eye” and texture analyzer. The panel of trained assessors identified and evaluated 10 sensory descriptors able to define {{the quality of the}} products. Statistical analysis highlighted that sensory characteristics related to appearance and texture were the most significant in discriminating samples belonged to the highest (high quality cooked hams) and the lowest (cooked hams) quality of the product whereas the selected cooked hams, showed intermediate characteristics. In particular, high quality samples were characterized, above all, by the highest intensity of pink intensity, typical appearance and cohesiveness, and, at the same time, by the lowest intensity of juiciness; standard <b>cooked</b> <b>ham</b> samples showed the lowest intensity of all visual attributes and the highest value of juiciness, whereas the intermediate category (selected <b>cooked</b> <b>ham)</b> was not discriminated from the other. Also physical-rheological parameters measured by electronic eye and texture analyzer were effective in classifying samples. In particular, the PLS model built with data obtained from the electronic eye showed a satisfactory performance in terms of prediction of the pink intensity and presence of fat attributes evaluated during the sensory visual phase.

Six genetic lines (Berkshire, Duroc, Danbred, Newsham Hybrid, Hampshire, and DeKalb genetics) were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four diets differing in protein level (1. 25, 1. 1, 0. 95, and 0. 8 % lysine) and one of three slaughter weights (114, 132, and 150 kg) within genetic line and dietary protein level. Approximately 600 animals (barrows and gilts) comprised three replicates with all treatments represented within a replicate. Hams were removed from one carcass side (24 h postmortem), packaged, and shipped at 0 to 10 ?C to Rosenthal Meat Science & Technology Center, Texas A&M University. Hams were evaluated for shipping yield. The Gluteus medius muscle of the ham face was evaluated for pH (HI 9025 C, Hanna Instruments, Limena, Italy) and reflectance, L*, a*, and b* utilizing a Minolta Chromameter (model CR- 300, Minolta, Inc., Ramsey, NJ). Three trained panelists evaluated the Gluteus medius surface for color and firmness (5 -point National Pork Producers Council color and firmness scale). Hams were dissected into skin, subcutaneous fat, seam fat, bone, other lean, inside ham muscle (Semimembranosus), outside ham muscle (Biceps femoris and Semitendinosus), and knuckle (Quadriceps femoris). The anterior portion of the three major ham muscles was removed to determine drip loss (%). Reflectance, L*, a*, b*, sensory color, sensory firmness, and pH were determined on the cut surface of the three major ham muscles. Ham muscles were injected with brine, packaged in CN 560 cook-in bags (Cryovac Division, Sealed Air Corp., Duncan, SC), tumbled, and cooked to 71 ?C. Cook yields and slice yields were determined for each muscle.
