25|$|Two {{dimensional}} imaging {{can provide}} a <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>view</b> along a single plane of all four chambers of the heart, and therefore, unlike Doppler, which assesses blood prior to primary filtration by the lungs, can also assess blood which will be circulated systemically. Echocardiography equipment has developed from bulky laboratory equipment to portable battery-powered with sufficient resolution suitable for field studies. Transthoracic echocardiography is suitable for the sampling used in decompression studies to identify highly reflective gas bubbles. Detection of venous gas bubbles by ultrasound imaging is a sensitive, but not specific, predictor of adverse effects of decompression, similar to the published relationship between Doppler detected bubbles and decompression sickness.|$|E

This paper examines the surface and <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>views</b> of the electrodes using scanning electron micrography. Two types of samples for <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>viewing</b> were prepared by mechanically breaking the substrate and by using an Ar-ion etching beam. The former displays the surface of the TiO 2 particles and the latter shows the cross-section of the TiO 2 particles. We found interesting surface and cross-sectional structures in the scattering layer containing the 400 &#x 2009;nm diameter particles, which have an angular and horned shape. The influence of TiO 2 particle size and the thickness of the nanocrystalline-TiO 2 electrode in DSCs using four kinds of sensitizing dyes (D 149, K 19, N 719 and Z 907) and two kinds of electrolytes (acetonitrile-based and ionic-liquid electrolytes) are discussed in regards to conversion efficiency, which this paper aims to optimize...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} vortex breakdown on delta wings at high angles is presented. Thin delta wings having sweep angles of 70, 75, 80 and 85 degrees are being studied. Smoke flow visualization and the laser light sheet technique {{are being used}} to obtain <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>views</b> of the leading edge vortices as they break down. At low tunnel speeds (as low as 3 m/s) details of the flow, which are usually imperceptible or blurred at higher speeds, can be clearly seen. A combination of lateral and longitudinal <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>views</b> provides information on the three dimensional nature of the vortex structure before, during and after breakdown. Whereas details of the flow are identified in still photographs, the dynamic characteristics of the breakdown process were recorded using high speed movies. Velocity measurements were obtained using a laser Doppler anemometer with the 70 degree delta wing at 30 degrees angle of attack. The measurements show that when breakdown occurs the core flow transforms from a jet-like flow to a wake-like flow...|$|R

50|$|OCT Biomicroscopy {{is the use}} {{of optical}} {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) in place of slit lamp biomicroscopy to examine the transparent, axial tissues of the eye. Traditionally, ophthalmic biomicroscopy has been completed with a slit lamp biomicroscope that uses slit beam illumination and an optical microscope to enable stereoscopic, magnified, <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>views</b> of transparent tissues in the eye, with or without the aid of an additional lens. Like slit lamp biomicroscopy, OCT does not penetrate opaque tissues well but enables detailed, <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>views</b> of transparent tissues, often with greater detail than is possible with a slit lamp. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) is much better at imaging through opaque tissues since it uses high energy sound waves. Because of its limited depth of penetration, UBM's main use within ophthalmology has been to visualize anterior structures such as the angle and ciliary body. Both ultrasound and OCT biomicroscopy produce an objective image of ocular tissues from which measurements can be made. Unlike UBM, OCT biomicroscopy can image tissues with high axial resolution as far posteriorly as the choroid (Figure 1).|$|R

40|$|Smolder spread {{experiments}} for a thin horizontal cellulosic {{powder bed}} of high bulk density {{were conducted with}} an air stream over the bed. In the experiments, achievement of a two-dimensional structure of the smolder zone was attempted, and spread rate, <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>views,</b> and temperature profiles of the smolder zone were examined. It was observed that for forward smolder spread as the air stream velocity increases, the dependence of the spread rate on the air stream velocity increases at first, but above a critical air stream velocity the spread rate becomes almost independent of the air stream velocity and ultimately complete extinction of the smolder zone occurs. This variation is closely related with the variation {{of the structure of}} the smolder zone as seen in <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>views.</b> From the comparison of experimental data, it is inferred that the heat balance around the intersection between the exposed, inclined surface of the char oxidation zone and the top surface of the virgin part of the bed is very important to the smolder spread behavior in a thin and high density fuel layer. The aerodynamic effects in the boundary layer over the smolder zone surface control the spread behavior through heat transfer processes. Key Words...|$|R
50|$|Commonly {{known as}} a CT Scan or CAT scan, this form of imaging {{is very similar to}} x-ray {{technology}} but produces many more images than an x-ray does. The multiple images produce <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>views</b> not possible with an x-ray. This allows a physician or radiologist to examine the images from many more angles than an x-ray allows. For this reason the CT scan is much more accurate in detecting spondylolysis than an x-ray. Bone scintigraphy combined with CT scan is considered the gold standard which means that it is best at detecting spondylolysis.|$|R
