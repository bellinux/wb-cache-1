5|$|The precise {{founding}} of the Gophers men's basketball program at the University of Minnesota is somewhat nebulous. Unlike many other universities with later foundations, the team did not form as a <b>conscious</b> <b>act</b> of the campus administration. The University's student newspaper at the time, the Ariel, reported on basketball throughout 1895 as the sport {{was introduced to the}} campus from a rival school, Minnesota A in St. Paul, later incorporated into the larger University of Minnesota Twin Cities. In 1896, a team from the school began to participate in a league with the Agriculture school, YMCA teams, and other local associations. The establishment of the Armory on-campus gave the team a new place to play. In February 1897, L. J. Cooke, a director of the Minneapolis YMCA, was hired on a part-time basis to coach the basketball program, and became the full-time coach and director of physical education by the fall of that year. Cooke {{was one of the first}} full-time professional coaches in all of college basketball and would remain at the program for 28 seasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{premise of}} the series is that Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is a Slayer, endowed with superhuman {{strength}} to fight vampires and evil creatures in the fictional town of Sunnydale. In the fourth season, Buffy begins attending college, where she discovers that her psychology professor, Walsh, is a scientist for the Initiative. Adam is Dr. Walsh's horrible masterpiece, an allusion to Frankenstein's monster, whose first <b>conscious</b> <b>act</b> is killing his creator. Adam's search for understanding himself and his true nature, combined for his penchant for chaos, leads him to orchestrate a massacre between demons and humans, after which {{he will be able}} use body parts left over from the melee to create an army of monsters to set loose on Sunnydale. Buffy's effectiveness as a Slayer is increased because her close friends and family, called the Scooby Gang, assist her in her battles. By the end of season four the members of the group have become estranged and must come back together in order to defeat the apparently invincible Adam.|$|E

2500|$|Importantly, Maimonides, while {{enumerating}} the above, {{added the}} following caveat [...] "There {{is no difference}} between [...] 'his wife was Mehithabel' [...] {{on the one hand}} , and 'Hear, O Israel' on the other ... anyone who denies even such verses thereby denies God and shows contempt for his teachings more than any other skeptic, because he holds that the Torah can be divided into essential and non-essential parts..." [...] The uniqueness of the 13 fundamental beliefs was that even a rejection out of ignorance placed one outside Judaism, whereas the rejection of the rest of Torah must be a <b>conscious</b> <b>act</b> to stamp one as an unbeliever. Others, such as Rabbi Joseph Albo and the Raavad, criticized Maimonides' list as containing items that, while true, in their opinion did not place those who rejected them out of ignorance in the category of heretic. Many others criticized any such formulation as minimizing acceptance of the entire Torah. As noted, however, neither Maimonides nor his contemporaries viewed these principles as encompassing all of Jewish belief, but rather as the core theological underpinnings of the acceptance of Judaism.|$|E

What he had said or done during his ravings he knew not, for memory was a blank, and no human friend had been there to behold or listen. At that time, however, Tom did not think very deeply about these words, or, indeed, about anything else. His prostration {{was so great that}} he did not care at first to follow out any line of thought or to move a limb. A sensation of absolute rest and total indifference seemed to enchain all his faculties. He did not even know where he was, and did not care, but lay perfectly still, gazing up through the overhanging branches into the bright blue sky, sometimes dozing off into a sleep that almost resembled death, from which he awoke gently, to wonder, perhaps, in an idle way, what had come over him, and then ceasing to wonder before the thought had become well defined.|$|E

I confess that at first I rode such places with my feet loose in the stirrups, and that on the sheer walls I saw to it, by a definite, <b>conscious</b> <b>act</b> of will, that the foot in the outside stirrup, overhanging the thousand feet of fall, was exceedingly loose. I say [...] "at first"; for, as in the crater itself we quickly lost our conception of magnitude, so, on the Nahiku Ditch, we quickly lost our apprehension of depth. The ceaseless iteration of height and depth produced a state of consciousness in which height and depth were accepted as the ordinary conditions of existence; and from the horse's back to look sheer down four hundred or five hundred feet became quite commonplace and non-productive of thrills. And as carelessly as the trail and the horses, we swung along the dizzy heights and ducked around or through the waterfalls.|$|E

60|$|The Duke of Argyll[71] remarks, {{that the}} {{fashioning}} of an implement {{for a special}} purpose is absolutely peculiar to man; and he considers that this forms an immeasurable gulf {{between him and the}} brutes. It is no doubt a very important distinction, but there appears to me much truth in Sir J. Lubbock’s suggestion,[72] that when primeval man first used flint-stones for any purpose, he would have accidentally splintered them, and would then have used the sharp fragments. From this step it would be a small one to intentionally break the flints, and not a very wide step to rudely fashion them. This latter advance, however, may have taken long ages, if we may judge by the immense interval of time which elapsed before the men of the neolithic period took to grinding and polishing their stone tools. In breaking the flints, as Sir J. Lubbock likewise remarks, sparks would have been emitted, and in grinding them heat would have been evolved: “thus the two usual methods of obtaining fire may have originated.” The nature of fire would have been known in the many volcanic regions where lava occasionally flows through forests. The anthropomorphous apes, guided probably by instinct, build for themselves temporary platforms; but as many instincts are largely controlled by reason, the simpler ones, such as this of building a platform, might readily pass into a voluntary and <b>conscious</b> <b>act.</b> The orang is known to cover itself at night with the leaves of the Pandanus; and Brehm states that one of his baboons used to protect itself from the heat of the sun by throwing a straw-mat over its head. In these latter habits, we probably see the first steps towards some of the simpler arts; namely rude architecture and dress, as they arose amongst the early progenitors of man.|$|E

50|$|Edmund Husserl's {{phenomenology}} was {{an ambitious}} attempt {{to lay the}} foundations for {{an account of the}} structure of conscious experience in general. An important part of Husserl's phenomenological project was to show that all <b>conscious</b> <b>acts</b> are directed at or about objective content, a feature that Husserl called intentionality. Husserl published only a few works in his lifetime, which treat phenomenology mainly in abstract methodological terms; but he left an enormous quantity of unpublished concrete analyses. Husserl's work was immediately influential in Germany, with the foundation of phenomenological schools in Munich and Göttingen. Phenomenology later achieved international fame through the work of such philosophers as Martin Heidegger (formerly Husserl's research assistant), Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Through the work of Heidegger and Sartre, Husserl's focus on subjective experience influenced aspects of existentialism.|$|R

Blumenbach’s work provided for the later important distinction (by Samuel Hahnemann) between a sustaining power (homeostasis) and a generative power (Erzeugungskraft), not just for procreation in all its myriad forms, but also creative acts of the mind, which Coleridge said involved the imagination (as opposed to fancy), both primary (unconscious figuration) involving perception, and secondary, the latter leading to apperceptive concepts as a result of <b>conscious</b> <b>acts</b> of the mind (ideas applied to perceptions).|$|R

The second part deals with the objections of Benjamin Libet, allegedly based on brain-scientific foundations, against «positive free will». The third and main part shows that Libet’s anti-positive-free-will-position is due to an almost complete failure of a phenomenology of the <b>conscious</b> <b>acts</b> that precede, accompany and follow voluntary movement. The fourth part defends the thesis that Libet’s experimental results, far from supporting his philosophical stance, contain strong empirical confirmations of human free will, which, apart from a phenomenology of human acts, becomes further clear upon noticing striking philosophical deficiencies and contradictions in his distinction between ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ free will. The conclusions summarize the results, according to which positive free will and causality through freedom exist and are confirmed by Libet’s and other test results. Free will is the primary and model case of an efficient cause, instead of contradicting or challenging the principles of causality and of sufficient reaso...|$|R
