5000|$|Dicopper {{chloride}} trihydroxide [...] is {{the chemical}} compound with the formula Cu2(OH)3Cl. It {{is often referred}} to as tribasic copper chloride (TBCC), copper trihydroxyl chloride or <b>copper</b> <b>hydroxychloride.</b> It is a greenish crystalline solid encountered in mineral deposits, metal corrosion products, industrial products, art and archeological objects, and some living systems. It was originally manufactured on an industrial scale as a precipitated material used as either a chemical intermediate or a fungicide. Since 1994, a purified, crystallized product has been produced at the scale of thousands of tons per year, and used extensively as a nutritional supplement for animals.|$|E
40|$|Indexación: Web of Science; PubMedLeptospirillum ferriphilum Sp-Cl is a Gram negative, thermotolerant, curved, rod- shaped bacterium, {{isolated}} from an industrial bioleaching operation in northern Chile, where chalcocite {{is the major}} copper mineral and <b>copper</b> <b>hydroxychloride</b> atacamite is present in variable proportions in the ore. This strain has unique features {{as compared to the}} other members of the species, namely resistance to elevated concentrations of chloride, sulfate and metals. Basic microbiological features and genomic properties of this biotechnologically relevant strain are described in this work. The 2, 475, 669 bp draft genome is arranged into 74 scaffolds of 74 contigs. A total of 48 RNA genes and 2, 834 protein coding genes were predicted from its annotation; 55 % of these were assigned a putative function. Release of the genome sequence of this strain will provide further understanding of the mechanisms used by acidophilic bacteria to endure high osmotic stress and high chloride levels and of the role of chloride-tolerant iron-oxidizers in industrial bioleaching operations.

40|$|Atacamite, a <b>copper</b> <b>hydroxychloride,</b> is an {{important}} constituent of supergene oxide zones of copper deposits in northern Chile, whereas in similar deposits elsewhere, it is rare. In Chile, it has generally been {{assumed to be a}} primary constituent of the supergene zones. There are two difficulties with this supposition. The first is that atacamite requires saline water for its formation, whereas supergene oxidation was caused by percolating, oxygenated meteoric water, mainly rainwater. The second is that atacamite dissolves rapidly or undergoes phase change when exposed to fresh water. Supergene enrichment of copper deposits in northern Chile extended over a long period, 44 to 9 Ma, being terminated by the onset of hyperaridity. During this period, there was at least intermittent rainfall, exposing previously formed atacamite to dissolution or phase change. Furthermore, atacamite-bearing oxide zones in several deposits are directly overlain by thick Miocene alluvial gravels; the stream waters that transported these gravels would have permeated the oxide zones. In some deposits, atacamite-bearing assemblages occur both in the oxide zones and in contiguous gravels. We suggest that atacamite-bearing oxide assemblages {{are more likely to have}} been a replacement of preexisting oxide phases after the onset of hyperaridity at about 9 Ma. A hyperarid climate made possible evaporation and concentration of chloride in meteoric waters. In this paper, we discuss another source of saline waters to modify oxide zones. Dewatering of the Domeyko Basin expelled brines along faults, some of which had earlier guided the location of porphyry deposits. At the Spence porphyry copper deposit, saline waters, which δD vs δ 18 O isotope analyses identify as basinal brines, are presently rising through the deposit, then flowing away along the base of the covering gravels. Compositions of these waters lie within the stability fields of atacamite and brochantite, the two minerals that comprise the oxide zone. Evidence is presented for other porphyry deposits, Radomiro Tomic and Gaby Sur, that basinal brines may have been involved in the late formation of atacamite...|$|E
30|$|Malachite (CuCO 3 ·Cu(OH) 2) is {{more stable}} than azurite (2 CuCO 3 ·Cu(OH) 2) and {{verdigris}} (xCu(CH 3 COO 2)·yCu(OH) 2 ·zH 2 O), therefore showing less or slower reactivity towards many factors [119, 123]. It {{is known to be}} permanent in all binding media, lightfast and alkali proof. Its deeper colour is obtained by coarse grinding, and as a consequence of having relatively low refractive index, it shows better performances in tempera than in oil [50, 126]. Due to its chemical composition, malachite is subject to interactions with acids, bases, humidity, temperature and circulating ions. In presence of humidity, malachite stains can be observed, which are actually caused by proteinaceous binders degradation [64]. Moreover, ions such as Cl− present in the mortar, sand or in the bricks, can react with the basic carbonate to form <b>copper</b> <b>hydroxychlorides</b> ((Cu 2 Cl(OH) 3) atacamite, clinoatacamite, paratacamite botallackite) [119, 121, 123, 126 – 128] and the copper chloride nantokite [103]. Sulphate ions are also likely to be present in wall paintings, especially from the degradation of calcite to gypsum, from gypsum preparation layers [53], or from SO 2 /SO 3 pollution.|$|R
30|$|The polymorphs of <b>copper</b> <b>hydroxychlorides</b> (Cu 2 Cl(OH) 3) pose {{relevant}} nomenclature issues, {{especially as}} regards paratacamite {{which is often}} used as a synonym for clinoatacamite, even though the two minerals have different formulas ((Cu,M) 2 Cl(OH) 3) and Cu 2 Cl(OH) 3, respectively, where M = Zn, Ni) [1, 160]. Chlorides of Cu were identified as pigments in objects from different cultures [1, 118, 161, 162], and recently atacamite was found in colonial art [163], in China [164] and in Alhambra’s plasterwork [59]. As a pigment, it can be natural or synthetic, and the particles’ morphology and composition can clarify its origin [162, 164]. It is expected to form as a degradation product of Cu containing pigments, or artefacts such as bronzes, in presence of humidity and chloride anions [115, 119, 121, 158, 160, 165, 166]. It is however not stable in acidic conditions (oxalic acid, for example), which promotes the formation of mooloite (CuC 2 O 4 ·nH 2 O) [127]. Also, among the polymorphs, different stabilities are observed, botallackite being the first formed and more unstable, while paratacamite seems the favoured species at ambient temperature [167]. The polymorph paratacamite {{has so far been}} identified as degradation product on other Cu-containing pigments [64, 117, 119, 123, 129]. However, an interesting example is reported in literature: after the 1966 flood in Florence, green paratacamite was formed on azurite-containing wall paintings [115]. To treat sulphated walls, ammonium carbonate ((NH 4) 2 CO 3) and barium hydroxide (Ba(OH) 2) were used. The green paratacamite alterations turned blue after the treatment, but not permanently. In fact, in the alkaline conditions given by the treatment, paratacamite is dissolved by the ammonium carbonate, and blue Cu(OH) 2 formed. This hydroxide is not stable and it degrades either to black CuO or to hydroxychlorides. This latter reaction is more probable due to the continuous ingress of Cl− ions via capillary rise in walls, thus generating more green products, making this treatment not suitable in presence of degraded azurite [115].|$|R
40|$|Corrosion is a {{major source}} of {{degradation}} in heritage metal objects, and any remedial measures are subject to a strong (Western) ethic that favors conservation as opposed to restoration. 0 Accordingly, major scientific challenges exist for developing appropriate treatment methods to stabilize and protect artifacts after they are recovered from an archaeological site, both before and during their display or storage in a museum. Because inappropriate treatments can cause irreversible damage to irreplaceable objects, it is crucial that the chemical processes involved are fully understood and characterized before any preservation work is undertaken. In this regard, large infrastructural facilities such as synchrotrons, neutron sources, and partide accelerators provide a wealth of analytical possibilities, unavailable in smaller scale laboratories. In general, the intensity of the radiation available allows measurements on a short time scale or with high spatial resolution (or both), so heterogeneous changes induced by a chemical process can be recorded while they occur. The penetrative nature of the radiation (e. g., X-rays, protons, or neutrons) also allows a sample to be studied in air. If necessary, complete artifacts (such as paintings or statuettes) can be examined. In situ analysis in a controlled environment, such as a liquid or corrosive atmosphere, also becomes an exciting possibility. Finally, there are many complementary techniques (local atomic structure or crystal structure determination, macroscopic 3 -D imaging (tomographies), imaging chemical analysis, and so on) so the many distinct details of a problem can be thoroughly explored. In this Account, we discuss the application of this general philosophy to studies of corrosion and its prevention in cultural heritage metals, focusing on our recent work on copper alloys. More specifically, we use synchrotron-based techniques to evaluate the use of corrosion potential measurements as a possible monitoring method for copper-based objects recovered from marine environments. The extraction of chlorides from such artifacts is a process that must take place before the artifacts are put on display or stored, because air exposure of untreated metal will result in severe damage or loss in as little as a few weeks. Chloride is removed by soaking the artifact for up to two years in tap water or dilute sodium sesquicarbonate, with regular solution changes. Our research supports the effectiveness of this treatment for thin nantokite (copper(I) chloride) layers, but it raises questions for <b>copper</b> <b>hydroxychlorides</b> (atacamite and paratacamite), especially when these minerals are trapped in fissures. Electrochemical parameters such as the corrosion potential are shown to be insensitive to the physical presence of large hydroxychloride coverages if they overlie a cuprite (Cu 20) layer. X-ray absorption spectroscopy proves to be a good monitor for the chloride in solution over the working electrode, whereas X-ray diffraction offers the potential for real-time measurement of the surface chloride composition. In principle, the two techniques together offer the possibility of monitoring Norma...|$|R
