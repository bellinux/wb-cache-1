5|$|<b>Compulsory</b> <b>{{education}}</b> or grunnskóli (lit. “basic school”), is {{the period}} of education which is compulsory for all. The legislation concerning <b>compulsory</b> <b>education</b> was passed in 2007, and in 1996 municipalities took over the running of <b>compulsory</b> <b>education.</b> It comprises primary and lower secondary education, which often {{takes place at the}} same institution. The law states that education is mandatory for children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 16. The school year lasts nine months, and begins between August 21 and September 1, ending between May 31 and June 10. The minimum number of school days is 170, but after a new teachers’ wage contract, this will increase to 180. Lessons take place five days a week.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, primary {{education}} reform {{had become one}} of the top priorities in the People's Republic of China. About 160million Chinese people had missed all or part of their education because of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and in 1986 the National People's Congress enacted a law calling for nine years of <b>compulsory</b> <b>education.</b> By 1993, it was clear that much of the country was making little progress on implementing nine-year <b>compulsory</b> <b>education,</b> so the 1993–2000seven-year plan focused on this goal. One of the major challenges educators faced was the large number of rural schoolchildren dropping out to pursue work. Another issue was a large urban–rural divide: funding and teacher quality were far better in urban schools than rural, and urban students stayed in school longer.|$|E

These concerns were supported by Penny Low, MP for Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC.|$|E

Sunday schools were set up in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.
