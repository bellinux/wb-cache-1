The result {{afterwards}} was the breakup of most large private landholdings to be redistributed, especially under a system of <b>common</b> <b>tenancy</b> called ejidos. The lands could be worked individually or collectively {{by members of the}} ejido but the land could not be leased or sold. The process of dividing lands and developing ejido organizations continued into the 1930s under President Lázaro Cárdenas [...] By the end of the 1930s, haciendas almost entirely disappeared from central and southern Mexico with numerous small holdings of ten to twenty acres as well as ejidos becoming dominant.|$|E
50|$|Estate {{planning}} {{involves the}} will, trusts, beneficiary designations, powers of appointment, property ownership (joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, tenancy in <b>common,</b> <b>tenancy</b> by the entirety), gift, and powers of attorney, specifically the durable financial {{power of attorney}} and the durable medical power of attorney. After widespread litigation and media coverage surrounding the Terri Schiavo case, estate planning attorneys now often advise clients to also create a living will. Specific final arrangements, such as whether to be buried or cremated, are also often part of the documents. More sophisticated estate plans may even cover deferring or decreasing estate taxes or winding up a business.|$|E
50|$|The village headman or Lambardar was {{completely}} {{responsible for all}} the recommendations, the survey of lands, preparation of the records of rights in lands, settlement of the land revenues, demand in the Mahals, and {{the collection of the}} land revenue. The Regulation VII of 1822 accredited the legal sanction to these recommendations. In cases where estates were not held by the landlords, but by the cultivators in <b>common</b> <b>tenancy,</b> the state demand was allowed to be fixed at 95% of the rental. However, quite unfortunately, this system broke down as the state demand was excessively large and its working was quite rigid. The amount, payable by the cultivators was quite more than what they could afford.|$|E

Part II of this Article traces the history of federally funded housing programs and describes the various strategies employed. Part III discusses the recent changes in modern private lease law and recounts the basic rights and obligations of the landlord and tenant, which define and govern the rights of low-income families under a cash allowance program. Part IV describes the evolution of the public housing tenancy and demonstrates how its development has outpaced that of the <b>common</b> law <b>tenancy.</b> Part V explores the legal and social policy implications of dismantling the in-kind housing programs. Part VI concludes that the public housing tenancy is necessary to protect public housing tenants from victimization under private lease law...|$|R
50|$|The buyer(s) {{signing the}} real estate {{contract}} are liable (legally responsible) for providing the promised consideration for {{the real estate}}, which is typically money {{in the amount of}} the purchase price. However, the details about the type of ownership may not be specified in the contract. Sometimes, signing buyer(s) may direct a lawyer preparing the deed separately what type of ownership to list on the deed and may decide to add a joint owner(s), such as a spouse, to the deed. For example, types of joint ownership (title) may include <b>tenancy</b> in <b>common,</b> joint <b>tenancy</b> with right of survivorship, or joint tenancy by the entireties. Another possibility is ownership in trust instead of direct ownership.|$|R
40|$|When {{a person}} dies without a will, the State {{effectively}} supplies a will by default via {{the laws of}} intestate succession. The laws of intestate succession may trigger a transfer of real property – “Land, and generally whatever is erected or growing upon or affixed to land ” (Black 1983, 636) – {{in the form of}} tenancy in <b>common.</b> <b>Tenancy</b> in common is a form of joint ownership in which cotenants have an undivided partial interest in property. If a cotenant dies intestate, any interest in property passes to his heirs (Black). An undivided partial interest allows a cotenant (subject to the rights of other cotenants) to use the entire property as if it were his own regardless of the size of his partial interest in the property. Tenancy in common that is the result of an inter-generational transfer of property through intestate succession {{is often referred to as}} heir property (Mitchell 2001). Tenancy in common is a legal form of real property and is not necessarily the result of the laws of intestate succession. Some people choose to hold property as tenants in common. Some purposefully will their property to their heirs as tenants in common. In this paper, I use the term heir property to refer to property that is held in tenancy in common as a result of the laws of intestate succession. My focus on intestate succession results in part from the fact that poor people are more likely than others to die without a valid will (AARP 2000). Hence, any economic consequences associated with the laws of intestate succession will be of greater significance to low income people and the regions where they live. The prevalence of poverty is not evenly distributed across rural America. Pockets of poverty persist. The Appalachian Region, Indian Reservations and the Ozarks are notable rural examples. Since intestate succession may be endemic to these areas, it is important to further examine its influence on property ownership and any subsequent economic consequences...|$|E

50|$|A {{concurrent}} estate or co-tenancy {{is a concept}} in property law which describes the various ways in which property is owned {{by more than one}} person at a time. If more than one person owns the same property, they are referred to as co-owners. If more than one person leases the same property, they are called co-tenants or joint tenants. Most common law jurisdictions recognize <b>tenancies</b> in <b>common</b> and joint <b>tenancies,</b> and some also recognize tenancies by the entirety. Many jurisdictions refer to a joint tenancy as a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, and a few U.S. states treat the phrase joint tenancy as synonymous with a <b>tenancy</b> in <b>common.</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that land markets, including both land sales and tenancy markets, are neither efficient nor conducive to social equity. It is often argued that tenants, particularly share tenants, do not have proper incentives to work and invest, {{partly because of the}} disincentive effects of output sharing and partly because of the tenure insecurity. It is also widely accepted that land sales transactions tend to exacerbate the social equity and rural poverty by facilitating the concentration of land ownership by hands of a few wealthy landlords. Based on these presumptions, land reform programs have been implemented in a number of developing countries. This article critically reviews these presumptions both theoretically and empirically. Firstly, we identify why land tenancy transaction is more common than land sales transactions and why share <b>tenancy</b> is more <b>common</b> than leasehold <b>tenancy.</b> Secondly, we critically review the theories of share tenancy, tenure security, and adjustment costs of farm size. Thirdly, we empirically review the efficiency and equity effects of land markets as well as the impacts of conventional land reform programs. It has become clear from the literature review that land reform polices have generally failed to improve land use efficiency and social equity. It is also found that tenancy contracts, including share tenancy, are generally efficient and conducive to social justice. In conclusion, we propose to encourage tenancy transactions, in general, and share tenancy, in particular. Farmers, Farm Production and Farm Markets...|$|R
40|$|Our talk today {{considers}} the issues facing a {{trustee in bankruptcy}} when attempting to ascertain the extent or existence of a bankrupt's interest in real property. We will highlight issues which a trustee might reasonably encounter in ascertaining the extent of property available for distribution to creditors. We will consider two elements in particular {{in light of the}} recent decision of the High Court in Cummins (a bankrupt) v Cummins, and the Federal Court in Anderson v Peldan. Both cases involved an examination of joint tenancy. Joint tenancy is one way for two or more co-owners to hold their estate in common. It will only arise where there is a unity of time, title, possession and interest between co-owners, and then only where there is an intention to hold as such (Property Law Act Qld provides for a presumption in favour of <b>tenancy</b> in <b>common).</b> The joint <b>tenancy</b> provides each co-owner the right to survivorship - upon the death of an owner that owner's estate is extinguished and the estate of surviving co-owners are enlarged proportionately to the extent of the deceased's estate. This occurs irrespective of the deceased’s testamentary wishes. Anderson v Peldan concerned the severance by an insolvent of joint tenancy held by the insolvent and his elderly spouse and whether the severance before death is capable of being a “transfer of property” in terms of s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act...|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s, the Alabama Chapter CPUSA began {{organizing}} the poverty stricken rural Black sharecroppers. As cotton prices plummeted {{after the first}} World War, planters were forced to reduce acreage. With rising debts, {{when the stock market}} collapsed and cotton prices reached an all time low, small landholders were forced into tenancy and tenant's conditions deteriorated even worse. In the South, the most <b>common</b> form of <b>tenancy</b> was sharecropping. Propertyless workers paid their land owners with a portion of the crops they raised. Consequently, they were forced to raise the land owners' desired crop which meant they could not grow their own food. Because of the fact that most landowners sold cotton, the sharecroppers were forced to grow cotton, and as prices dropped they went further and further into debt. All tools, animals, food, and cash advances were considered “furnishings” and deducted from the sharecropper’s portion of the crop with interest. Black sharecroppers lived in one or two room shacks, usually without running water. Most shacks were not equipped with sanitary facilities, and the day to day diet consisted of beans, molasses, and cornbread causing both sickness and malnutrition. Plagued with sickness, illiteracy, and extreme poverty, most sharecroppers were forced to beg for food and cash advances and or spent numerous days without eating. As a result, the Alabama CPUSA took {{a leading role in the}} administration and organizing of the Alabama Sharecroppers Union (ASU), and by 1932 the ASU had between six hundred and eight hundred members.|$|R
5000|$|A {{tenancy at will}} is a tenancy which {{either the}} {{landlord}} or the tenant may terminate at any time by giving reasonable notice. Unlike a periodic tenancy, it isn't associated with a time period. It may last for many years, {{but it could be}} ended at any time by either the lessor or the lessee for any reason, or for no reason at all. Proper notice, as always with landlord/tenant law, must be given, as set forth in the state's statutes. If there is no formal lease, the tenancy at will is the one that usually exists. In rare cases it may occur where the tenancy is not for consideration. Under the modern <b>common</b> law, a <b>tenancy</b> at will without compensation is very rare, partly because it comes about only if the parties expressly agree that the tenancy is for no rent, commonly where a family member is allowed to live in a home (a nominal consideration may be required) without any formal arrangements. In most residential tenancies for a fixed term, for consideration, the tenant may not be removed except for cause, even if there is no written lease. (However, an oral lease for more than 12 months is not enforceable if the statute of frauds in the jurisdiction includes leases of more than 12 months.) Many residential leases convert to [...] "at will" [...] tenancy subject to 30-days notice. Alternatively, a tenancy at will (without a specific time limit) may exist for a temporary period where a tenant wishes to take possession of a property and the landlord agrees, but there is insufficient time in which to negotiate and complete a new lease. In this case, the tenancy at will is terminated as soon as a new lease is negotiated and signed. The parties may also agree on the basis that if the parties fail to enter into a new lease within a reasonable time period, then the tenant must vacate the premises.|$|R
