40|$|This paper {{examines}} export-promoting production subsidies in {{a dynamic}} product-cycle model with {{learning by doing}} and spillovers from experience. History dictates that the South is less experienced than the North and, thus, produces less advanced goods. Non-uniform Southern export promoting production subsidies applied to a small set of marginal industries {{that are on the}} verge of being internationally competitive, generate conventional static benefits for the South and costs for the North. Since such an industrial policy expands the South's range of production, it ultimately enhances Southern learning. The South's rate of production and technology transfer and the North's rate of innovation both increase, creating <b>dynamic</b> <b>benefits</b> for each country. While the South must gain overall, the North will also gain if the <b>dynamic</b> <b>benefits</b> outweigh the static costs.

40|$|An {{effective}} demand response (DR) model framework for DR management systems {{in a residential}} premise is proposed. The proposed model consists of dynamic price signals from load serving entity (LSE), benefit function, and loss of consumer comfort. The conventional approaches generally consider these factors as independent in their formulation. Since these factors have functional relationship, the proposed model points to a holistic approach to capture the relationship. The scheduling model can be integrated with the home energy scheduler coupled to the smart meter, which facilitates the flow of dynamic price and energy consumption information {{to and from the}} household premise. The objective is to maximize net consumer surplus, which is formulated as a function of all aforementioned factors. A method for developing a practical and <b>dynamic</b> consumer <b>benefit</b> model for matured DR programs is proposed in this paper. For the purpose of showing the effectiveness of <b>dynamic</b> <b>benefit</b> function, a set of analytically formulated benefit functions is also considered. The suitability of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>benefit</b> function, as compared with other alternatives, is illustrated with an example.

A faster flow of FDI to the South then leaves the rates of innovation, imitation, and ITT essentially unaffected, so FDI generates mostly static benefits. ...|$|R

Discriminatory liberalisation will switch imports from sources with high stocks of knowledge towards ASEAN countries, which have lower stocks, and so may lower productivity growth.

Under the Black-Scholes framework and using results pertaining to reflected Brownian motion, we obtain explicit pricing formulas for the DWB payment stream and the maturity guarantee. These pricing formulas are also derived by means of Esscher transforms, which is another seminal contribution by Gerber to finance.

40|$|The {{doctrine}} of "patent exhaustion" {{implies that the}} authorized sale of patented goods "exhausts" the patent rights in the goods sold and precludes additional license fees from downstream buyers. This paper offers the first formal economic model of domestic patent exhaustion that incorporates transaction costs in consumer licensing, and examines how a shift in patent policy from absolute to presumptive exhaustion, in which the patent owner can opt- out of exhaustion via contract, affects social welfare. The results show that when transaction costs are low, presumptive exhaustion is socially optimal, because it allows welfare-enhancing price discrimination via downstream licensing. Conversely, when transaction costs are high, the regime of presumptive patent exhaustion leads to a greater loss of static efficiency, because transaction cost frictions offset the benefits of price discrimination, but <b>dynamic</b> <b>benefits</b> in promoting ex ante investment in product quality may outweigh any static inefficiencies...|$|R

In addition, developing Asia has on average benefited significantly from quality upgrading, helping it capitalize on already existing comparative advantages.
