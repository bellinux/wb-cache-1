40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} <b>calendering</b> machine and experimental results of <b>calendering</b> process. A particular pattern was printed on PET film by means of roll-to-roll gravure printing machine. The <b>calendering</b> process was applied {{to a set of}} samples and the effect was analyzed after measuring the surface roughness and the thickness of pattern. Although only mechanical pressure provided by a nip roll was applied during the <b>calendering</b> process, the experimental results indicate that the <b>calendering</b> process should be useful for enhancing the surface quality of roll-to-roll printed electronics products...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} paper <b>calender</b> {{was designed}} and built to measure paper strain in the nip of the <b>calender</b> {{as a function of}} machine speed, load and <b>calender</b> roll radius. The effect of roll deflection due to bending was eliminated by making the <b>calender</b> as narrow as possible while still reproducing industrial conditions in all other aspects. The width of the new machine is 75 mm. Permanent paper strains measured with the new equipment reproduced previously published results. In-nip paper strains were obtained under a variety of <b>calendering</b> conditions. Paper strains under load have previously been obtained in a platen press; the new data also reproduce these results. The equipment can now be used for a full experimental program to determine an empirical relationship between paper stress (in terms of the <b>calendering</b> variables) and strain (in terms of paper thickness in the nip) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} <b>calendering</b> {{is used as}} a {{downstream}} technique to shape monolithic co-extruded fixed-dose combination products in a continuous way. Co-extrudates with a metoprolol tartrate-loaded sustained-release core and a hydrochlorothiazide-loaded immediate-release coat were produced and immediately shaped into a monolithic drug delivery system via <b>calendering,</b> using chilled rolls with tablet-shaped cavities. In vitro metoprolol tartrate release from the ethylcellulose core of the <b>calendered</b> tablets was prolonged in comparison with the sustained release of a multiparticulate dosage form, prepared manually by cutting co-extrudates into mini-matrices.

40|$|A {{dynamic model}} of the <b>calendering</b> of paper which {{incorporates}} relationships for both roll local thermal deformation and the stress-strain behaviour of paper in and after the nip was developed, validated, then used to demonstrate its application to model predictive control of <b>calendering.</b> The experimental determination of the stress-strain behaviour of paper included documenting the effect of initial temperature and moisture content as well as process parameters, and was expressed as the in-nip <b>calendering</b> equation. The rheological behaviour of commercial newsprint made from thermomechanical pulp {{was found to be}} a strong nonlinear function of temperature and moisture content over the wide range of 20 to 80 °C and 1 to 14 % moisture. A simplified model for the transient local deformation of a <b>calender</b> roll in response to a local cross-machine (CD) control action was determined and validated against the previous complete numerical analysis solution for a variety of roll designs and thermal boundary conditions. This model, appropriate for use in real-time control, was shown to be effective in seeking a compromise between the conflicting CD control objectives of large roll deformation, fine CD resolution and fast control response time. From the above two elements a dynamic {{model of the}} <b>calendering</b> process was developed by appropriate combination of the model of transient local <b>calender</b> roll deformation with the in-nip <b>calendering</b> equation used to estimate, at a specific CD position, in-nip strain from permanent strain. Use of the model shows that paper response to a control action is highly sensitive to local nip load and to temperature and moisture content of the paper. After validation with published measurements on an industrial <b>calender,</b> the effectiveness of this model for minimizing thickness nonuniformity in the CD dimension through implementation of model predictive control of <b>calendering</b> was demonstrated. For a multi-roll <b>calender</b> stack of industrial specifications this demonstration showed an impressive reduction in CD control response time through use of multi-step control action. This model opens the prospect of a significant industrial innovation through the introduction of model predictive control to the difficult problem of CD control of <b>calendering...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Calendering</b> is an {{operation}} {{carried out on}} a fabric to improve its aesthetics. The fabric passes {{through a series of}} <b>calender</b> rollers by wrapping; the face in contact with a roller alternates from one roller to the next. An ordinary <b>calender</b> consists of a series of hard and soft (resilient) bowls (rollers) placed in a definite order. The soft roller may be compressed with either cotton or wool-paper, linen paper or flax paper. The hard metal bowl is either of chilled iron or cast iron or steel. The <b>calender</b> may consist of 3, 5, 6, 7 and 10 rollers. The sequence of the rollers is that no two hard rollers are in contact with each other. Pressure may be applied by compound levers and weights, or hydraulic pressure may be used as an alternative. The pressure and heat applied in <b>calendering</b> depend on the type of the finish required.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT During <b>calendering,</b> {{which is}} done {{in order to improve}} its {{printing}} properties, the paper is compressed in one or more roll nips. Paper is a viscoelastic material and this will influence its performance during <b>calendering.</b> At least for woodfree paper, the imposed compressive stress has a much greater influence on the remaining deformation (after unloading) than the duration of the compression. A consequence of this is that a soft <b>calender</b> nip will produce a lower deformation than a hard <b>calender</b> nip at a given line load. Furthermore, a soft nip does not suppress surface topography in a size region corresponding to fibre flocs as much as a hard nip. In this perspective, soft-nip <b>calendering</b> constitutes a more uniform treatment than hard-nip <b>calendering.</b> However, the in-plane density variations increased with both types of <b>calender</b> nips, although less pronounced in the case of soft nip <b>calendering.</b> 	<b>Calendering</b> at a high temperature leads to a selective deformation of the surface region. This phenomenon can be used to optimise the relationship between mechanical and surface properties. At a given degree of deformation, properties like stiffness and gloss depends on the conditions at which the deformation was achieved. Calculations of an effective bending modulus can be used to characterise the stratification of the structure induced by the high-temperature <b>calendering.</b> A similar effect can in principle also be attained by establishing a moisture gradient in the thickness direction of the sheet. Moisture is more difficult to use (than temperature) for such a purpose. A water box application directly on a <b>calender</b> was one working strategy employed here in order to obtain moisture gradient <b>calendering.</b> 	A positive effect of precalendering a woodfree sheet with regard to surface smoothness could be seen also after coating and final <b>calendering,</b> although it is expected that some of the precalendering effect is offset due to contact with the aqueous phase. Final <b>calendering</b> led to some development of gloss variations. This might indicate an uneven surface porosity, which may have a negative influence on printing properties. However, the precalendering facilitated a more uniform coating layer, which is expected to {{have a positive effect on}} printing properties. In total, it seemed that precalendering was on the whole beneficial for the final properties of the paper product. The degree of precalender deformation controlled the final properties. Speed, type of nip or temperature as such in the precalender operation, appeared not to have major influence on the final properties. 	Water/paper interactions is a common denominator in many cases of interplay between process steps in papermaking. Minimising these interactions appears in many cases to be a useful route to improve the relation beneficial between mechanical and surface properties, since water exposure can lead to an irreversible deformation of the surface structure. Penetration of water and water-based fluids appeared to be controlled mostly by the openness, or porosity of the surface and on the external pressure used when applying the fluid. Wet-pressing and <b>calendering</b> are processes that lead to closure of the surface, which helps to minimise the water penetration in subsequent process steps, e. g. surface sizing and coating...|$|R

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that the same Si/alloy {{electrode}} material showed very different electrochemical behavior with different <b>calendering.</b> All the <b>calendered</b> electrode cells showed stable cycling behavior compared to the not-pressed electrode cell, but the overall capacity was lower with increasing <b>calendering</b> pressure due to reduced electrolyte wettability. Although the capacities are lowered, the stable cycle behavior with <b>calendering</b> would also make it easier to design high-density full cell batteries. In this case, 3 -ton pressed Si/alloy electrode cell with a considerable capacity tradeoff showed high density and excellent cycle stability compared to the not-pressed Si/alloy electrode cell. Electrodes densification improves the particle-to-particle connections with pressing. However, the electrochemical performance is affected due to reduced electrolyte wettability and reduced electrochemical activity indicating the need for densification control and wettability optimization. Si/alloy electrodes with 5 and 8 tons pressed also showed stable cycling, but the capacities are very low to be considered. Therefore, optimization and balancing between the <b>calendering</b> pressure and electrolyte wettability property can help tune to the best electrochemical properties of the battery materials.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the process and}} challenges of adding a new <b>calender</b> machine to AvCarb Material Solutions' pyrolytic graphite production plant. Before the machine {{could be used for}} mass production, several experiments needed to be conducted to better understand the capabilities of the machine. A process control procedure was designed to set up the machine to produce parts within specification. By using a one-factor-at-a-time approach, the process capability (Cpk) ofthe <b>calender</b> machine can be significantly improved. Additionally, the <b>calender</b> machine was used to investigate the significance of common defects on the uncalendered material. Experiments show that spots that are 3 millimeters or less, scratches, and certain ripples do not cause a destructive effect on the <b>calendered</b> sheet; therefore, sheets with these defects can be safely passed through the quality inspection stage. Foreign object debris causes bubbles, which are destructive effects, to appear on the <b>calendered</b> sheet; therefore, sheets with foreign object debris should not pass inspection. However, if the foreign object debris is physically removed from the sheet before <b>calendering,</b> the resulting sheet will not have any destructive defects. Thus, by not rejecting uncalendered sheets with certain defects, AvCarb can improve its process yield. Additionally, a thermal conductivity test apparatus was designed and used to determine that the <b>calendered</b> heat spreader is 70 % more thermally conductive than its uncalendered counterpart. by Ernest Knute Svenson.

The wetting rate, which is the electrolyte transport rate in the porous electrode, can be quantified using the wetting balance.

A graphite anode film with an as-coated thickness of 59 μm was used as baseline electrode film and was <b>calendered</b> to produce films with thickness ranging from 55 to 41 µm. Results show that wettability is improved by light <b>calendering</b> from an initial thickness of 59 μm to a <b>calendered</b> thickness of 53 μm where the wetting rate increased from 0. 375 to 0. 589 mm/s 0. 5.
