The mode of action of these iodoquinolinol compounds upon intestinal amoe bae is not known. Although the drugs are considered ineffective in nonintestinal amoebiasis, the frequency with which amoebae are found deep in the intestinal mucosa would seem to indicate that the active form of the compound does reach them in the depths of amoebic lesions.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversitySeveral culture {{media were}} tested. The trichomonads multiplied only in gastric mucin-Loeffler's dried blood serum {{dissolved}} in a slight modification of Drbohlav's modified Ringer's solution. 	Among the species of intestinal trichomonads {{of the golden}} hamster that were studied only T. microti and T. wenyoni grew in the artificial culture medium. 	Several techniques of determining {{whether or not the}} hamsters were infected with trichomonads, methods of obtaining population counts, and several staining methods were presented. 	Protozoa other than T. microti and T. wenyoni were successfully cultured in the modified culture medium. 	Bacteria-free cultures of trichomonads were assured by adding to the culture medium penicillin and streptomycin in combination, and also terramycin. 	Cysts induced artificially and those found in the animal's feces were activated by placing them in a warm place or by using aqueous pancreatin solution. These cysts multiplied in the modified culture medium. 	The resistance of the intestinal trichomonads of the golden hamster to physical and chemical agents was discussed. Many antiseptics, ultraviolet light, high temperatures and low temperatures are lethal for the trichomonads. The trichomonads are resistant to X-rays. Hypotonic or hypertonic solutions of sodium chloride are destructive for these trichomonads. 	Experiments in vitro, with penicillin, streptomycin, terramycin, aureomycin, ahloromycetin, Carbarsone, <b>Chiniofon,</b> copper sulfate, Phenothiazine were described. 	Experiments in vivo, with Carbarsone, Chinifon, Phenothiazine, copper sulfate, Vioform, terramycin, and aureomycin were described. Carbarsone showed the best trichomonadicidal action per os. 	The hamsters are extremely resistant to high doses of Carbarsone. Prolonged administration of Carbarsone is harmful to animals. 	The pathogenicity of the intestinal trichomonads of the golden hamster was examined. These trichomonads are not pathogenic for man or for the hamsters. The author swallowed a mixed culture of T. microti and T. wenyoni, but no digestive abnormalities were observed subsequently...|$|E
