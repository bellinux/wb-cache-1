Sergent decided to commission one artist to decorate the walls of the cathedral. He chose Dargent who painted frescoes for the nine principal chapels completing twenty murals spread over these nine chapels each having two paintings and two smaller chapels having just one painting.|$|E

500|$|Following the crew's wake up, {{they set}} to work {{preparing}} for the mission's first spacewalk. Grunsfeld and Feustel suited up {{with the assistance of}} their EVA counterparts, Massimino and Good, and the spacewalk officially began when the two switched their suits to battery power at 12:52 UTC. At the start of the spacewalk, Feustel provided managers on the ground with a visual inspection report on the particulate matter seen earlier around the WFC3 box, reporting to the ground team that [...] "I don't really see any of those particles...It's almost imperceivable. I <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> few particles {{on the front of the}} W-SIPE, little, whitish, grey looking, real small. It's low density, too." [...] After getting their tools and equipment for the EVA set up, Grunsfeld and Feustel removed the old Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2, which was installed in 1993 during the telescope's first servicing mission, and replaced it with the new Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3). Feustel initially had trouble removing the bolts from the old camera, which after over fifteen years in space required more torque to remove than expected. After multiple attempts, managers on the ground decided to have Grunsfeld get a contingency torque limiter from the airlock, which would allow Feustel to apply more force without exceeding a specific point, but the bolt would still not release. The concern was that the bolt would shear, and the camera would be unable to be removed should that happened. Finally, managers approved Feustel to remove the limiter, and apply as much force as he safely thought it would take to release the bolt, which was successful.|$|E

2500|$|One {{technology}} used {{under the name}} [...] "full-body scanner" [...] is the millimeter wave scanner, the active form of which reflects extremely high frequency radio waves off the body to make an image on which one <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> types of objects hidden under the clothes. Passive millimeter wave screening devices rely on only the raw energy that is naturally emitted from the human body or objects concealed on the body; passive devices do not transmit millimeter waves. Another technology in use is the backscatter X-ray.|$|E

2500|$|The large space {{contained}} numerous chairs, couches, {{and other}} furnishings in {{a blend of}} Indian and English design. Several pieces of [...] "deliberate Anglo-Indian design" [...] were created for the Dorothy Vernon Room, consisting of a sofa (Deanery.354), two armchairs (Deanery.355–356), and two side chairs (Deanery.357–358). These pieces were made of dark wood decorated with panels of perforated copper and stenciled designs in black paint on the frame. From a 1908 photograph of the room, one <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of Garrett's teakwood furniture from Baltimore (e.g. Deanery.382–383), {{as well as the}} swing settee by de Forest and his Ahmedebad Wood Carving Co. The settee is composed of intricately carved teak panels and hangs from four elaborately designed brass chains that depict three-dimensional birds, elephants, and human figures.|$|E
2500|$|Cats have {{a visual}} {{field of view}} of [...] 200° {{compared}} with 180° in humans, but a binocular field (overlap in the images from each eye) narrower than that of humans. As with most predators, their eyes face forward, affording depth perception {{at the expense of}} field of view. Field of view is largely dependent upon the placement of the eyes, but may also be related to the eye's construction. Instead of the fovea, which gives humans sharp central vision, cats have a central band known as the visual streak. Cats <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> colors, and can tell the difference between red, blue and yellow lights, as well as between red and green lights. Cats are able to distinguish between blues and violets better than between colors near the red end of the spectrum. A 2014 study found that, along with several other mammals, cats lenses transmit significant amounts of ultraviolet (UVA 315–400nm) light, which suggests that they possess sensitivity to this part of the spectrum.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{species can}} see light with {{frequencies}} outside the human [...] "visible spectrum". Bees {{and many other}} insects can detect ultraviolet light, which helps them to find nectar in flowers. Plant species that depend on insect pollination may owe reproductive success to ultraviolet [...] "colors" [...] and patterns rather than how colorful they appear to humans. Birds, too, can see into the ultraviolet (300–400nm), and some have sex-dependent markings on their plumage that are visible only in the ultraviolet range. Many animals that can see into the ultraviolet range, however, cannot see red light or any other reddish wavelengths. [...] For example, bees' visible spectrum ends at about 590nm, just before the orange wavelengths start. Birds, however, <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> red wavelengths, although not as far into the light spectrum as humans. It is an incorrect popular belief that the common goldfish is the only animal that can see both infrared and ultraviolet light, their color vision extends into the ultraviolet but not the infrared.|$|E
