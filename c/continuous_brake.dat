2500|$|After the {{introduction}} of the <b>continuous</b> <b>brake</b> system in 1903 it became possible to operate trains with five locomotives, and on [...] descending passenger trains up to five Fell brake vans could be used â€“ two next to the locomotives, one in the middle, and two at the rear. [...] As each brake van had its own guard and the train had a train guard and locomotive crews, a train with five brake vans and four locomotives had a crew of 14, which added to the expense of the operation.|$|E

40|$|In this study, two {{different}} ventilated brake discs were manufactured and their braking force performances and heat generations were investigated experimentally {{together with a}} solid disc. Braking force outputs were examined in sudden and <b>continuous</b> <b>braking</b> conditions and disc temperatures were simply measured in <b>continuous</b> <b>braking</b> conditions. Fourteen pedal forces were used in sudden braking tests and eight periodic measurements were executed in <b>continuous</b> <b>braking</b> tests. Experiment results showed that ventilation applications not only increased the brake force outputs up to 42. 6 %, but also reduced the heat formation on discs up to 31. 5 % depending on test conditions...|$|R

50|$|By {{the end of}} 1900 {{the company}} had 210 engines fitted with <b>continuous</b> <b>brake</b> equipment, and 97% of {{passenger}} mileage was under such conditions. 2,021,266 train miles were run with the automatic vacuum brake, and 69,160 with Westinghouse.|$|E
50|$|As train speeds increased, {{it became}} {{essential}} {{to provide some}} more powerful braking system capable of instant application and release by the train driver, described as a <b>continuous</b> <b>brake</b> {{because it would be}} effective continuously {{along the length of the}} train.|$|E
50|$|A {{passenger}} brake van originally {{served the}} same purpose as a goods brake van, but, when <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes</b> became standard on passenger trains, its use changed.

The vehicle also provides a compartment for the guard, a luggage compartment, and sometimes passenger accommodation, as well.|$|R

5000|$|As train loads, {{gradients}} and speeds increased, braking {{became a}} problem. In the late 19th century, significantly better continuous brakes started to appear. The earliest type of <b>continuous</b> <b>brake</b> was the chain brake [...] which used a chain, running {{the length of}} the train, to operate brakes on all vehicles simultaneously.|$|E
5000|$|When the Company {{incorporated}} a <b>continuous</b> <b>brake</b> into tis train working, it adopted the Westinghouse brake for passenger trains.

50|$|In 1890 the Board of Trade {{ordered that}} the block system and <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes</b> be instituted {{on the lines}} (L&CR and the LLUC line, for which the L&CR had responsibility). The block system is a train control {{procedure}} in which a railway line {{is considered to be}} divided into sections, and no train may enter a section unless it can be verified that no other train is in the section. See Signalling block system. <b>Continuous</b> <b>brakes</b> are brakes that can be controlled throughout the train by the driver, and if they are automatic brakes then they are automatically applied in both portions if the train becomes accidentally divided. See Railway brake.|$|R

5000|$|Locomotive {{air brakes}} (Freno Diretto or Moderabile): takes {{air from the}} main {{reservoir}} tanks, bypassing the brake pipe and directly loading the brake cylinders of the locomotive, thus braking it. It is slightly faster than the <b>continuous</b> <b>brake,</b> but brakes the locomotive only; it is not advisable {{to be used to}} brake a full, wagon-fitted train, since it can cause a [...] "spring effect".|$|E
5000|$|Many British freight trains {{formerly}} had no <b>continuous</b> <b>brake</b> so {{the only}} available brakes were those on the locomotive and the brake van. Because of this shortage of brake power, the speed was restricted to 25 mph. The brake van was marshalled {{at the rear of}} the train so both portions of the train could be brought to a stand in the event of a coupling breaking.|$|E
5000|$|The {{driver of}} the return {{excursion}} train from Scarborough to Newcastle approached the South Junction signal box at approximately 45 miles per hour, having observed the previous signals displaying [...] "Clear". The driver stated the first he knew of an obstruction on the line was seeing the headlights of another engine emerging from the left onto the down through line. The {{driver of the}} excursion train stated he had less than two seconds to act during which time he made a <b>continuous</b> <b>brake</b> application.|$|E
50|$|In 1872 {{he began}} an {{apprenticeship}} under Francis William Webb at the London and North Western Railway's Crewe works. In 1878 Hoy {{transferred to the}} drawing office, where he designed <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|When freight trains were {{fitted with}} <b>continuous</b> <b>braking,</b> brake vans lost their importance, and were {{discontinued}} by many railways. However, they still continue on some important railways, {{such as the}} Indian Railways, besides the heritage railways.|$|R
50|$|The {{report also}} noted that the {{accident}} would have been considerably worse had the Mail not been fitted with <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes,</b> and noted that it might have stopped short of the buffers had the rails not been greasy.|$|R
50|$|The key {{recommendation}} {{was in fact}} couched as a finding:This terrible calamity {{would in}} all human probability have been prevented had the excursion train been fitted with an automatic <b>continuous</b> <b>brake</b> instead of (as it was) with only a non-automatic <b>continuous</b> <b>brake.</b> In the former case, on the dividing of the train taking place, the brake would have remained on, or (had it been previously taken off) {{would have been at}} once applied to, the rear vehicles, and these would have remained immovable, notwithstanding any possible bump they might have received {{from the front of the}} train, when the driver was setting back to make a start.It may also be remarked that the ordinary train had a narrow escape from serious collision between the portions into which it was divided, or with buffer stops; whereas had it been supplied with an automatic brake, there would have been no risk of such collisions.As the President of the Board of Trade has stated in Parliament his intention tointroduce a Bill to make compulsory the adoption of automatic continuous brakes,should the report on this collision point out that it would have been avoided had the excursion train been fitted with them, it is unnecessary for me to say more upon the subject.|$|E

50|$|The first railways, {{such as the}} {{pioneering}} Liverpool and Manchester Railway of 1830, used {{a version of the}} tramways buffer and chain coupling, termed a screw-coupling. Vehicles are coupled by hand using a hook and links with a turnbuckle-like device that draws the vehicles together. Vehicles have buffers, one at each corner on the ends, which are pulled together and compressed by the coupling device. With no <b>continuous</b> <b>brake</b> across the entire train, the whole train was reliant on the braking capacity of the locomotive, and train lengths were restricted.|$|E
5000|$|Early railways, before <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes,</b> had the {{communication}} chain or cord from the carriages {{connected to a}} [...] "brake whistle" [...] on the engine. This was usually of a lower note than the normal whistle used by the driver.|$|R
25|$|A similar {{railroad}} car design, {{the brake}} van, was used on British and Commonwealth railways. These provided the additional function of {{serving as a}} supplemental braking system for trains not fitted with a <b>continuous</b> <b>braking</b> system, and keeping chain couplings taut.|$|R
5000|$|Special {{adaptors}} {{could be}} employed to couple a set of transporter wagons onto {{the end of an}} [...] "ordinary" [...] narrow gauge freight train. <b>Continuous</b> <b>braking</b> was no problem, either, as the train air line could be incorporated into the bar couplers, too.|$|R
