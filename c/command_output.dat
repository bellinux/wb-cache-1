50|$|Theoretical {{work has}} shown that in models of motor control, when inverse models are used in {{combination}} with a forward model, the efference copy of the motor <b>command</b> <b>output</b> from the inverse model {{can be used as}} an input to a forward model for further predictions. For example if, in addition to reaching with the arm, the hand must be controlled to grab an object, an efference copy of the arm motor command can be input into a forward model to estimate the arm's predicted trajectory. With this information, the controller can then generate the appropriate motor command telling the hand to grab the object. It has been proposed that if they exist, this combination of inverse and forward models would allow the CNS to take a desired action (reach with the arm), accurately control the reach and then accurately control the hand to grip an object.|$|E

40|$|Real-time {{control systems}} are complex to design, and {{automation}} support is important. We {{are interested in}} systems with multiple tasks, each with multiple modes, implementing a functionality with different levels of quality (e. g., computation approximation), and cost (e. g., computation time, energy). It is complex to control the switching of modes {{in order to insure}} properties like bounding cost while maximizing quality. We outline a technique for the automatic generation of such controllers involving an automaton-based formal model, and using optimal discrete control synthesis. 1. Motivation Occurrences in application domains. We are interested in real-time control systems with multiple tasks, each with multiple modes, which can be versions implementing the same functionality with different levels of quality and cost. It is complex to control the switching of modes in order to insure properties like bounding cost while maximizing quality (i. e., limiting degradation). Application domains are: ffl control systems (e. g. robotics) where tasks implement the computation of a control law or function, in a cyclic way, reading sensor input, and producing actuator <b>command</b> <b>output.</b> A notion of quality is that the numerical computations involved, e. g., matrix computation for kinematic model update, can be performed with different levels of accuracy, by making approximations e. g., by limiting the development of series, or avoiding the computation of terms that have a negligible value under some conditions [5]. The control laws can also differ by the way energy is consumed by actuators or side-effects on the environment...|$|E

Twenty-three subjects with stable moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (age 73. 8 ± 5. 8 years, all male) took part in this study. During the 6 MWT, ventilatory and gas exchange parameters were measured using a portable respiratory gas analysis system. Dyspnea and oxygen saturation were recorded at the end of every 2 minute period during the test. There was a significant decrease in inspiratory capacity during the 6 MWT. This suggested that dynamic hyperinflation had occurred. Dyspnea showed a significant linear increase, and there was a significant negative correlation with inspiratory capacity. It was suggested that one of the reasons that dyspnea developed during the 6 MWT was the dynamic hyperinflation. Even though the tidal volume increased little after 2 minutes, dyspnea increased linearly to the end of the 6 MWT. These results suggest that the mechanisms generating dyspnea during the 6 MWT were the sense of respiratory effort at an early stage and then the mismatch between central motor <b>command</b> <b>output</b> and respiratory system movement.
