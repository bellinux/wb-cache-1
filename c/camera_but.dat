5|$|Many fans wanted Snake Eater {{to use a}} 3D <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> {{this was}} {{ultimately}} not implemented in the game. Kojima views Metal Gear Solid, Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater as a trilogy, and wished to keep the camera {{the same as the}} previous two {{in order to keep the}} feel of the three games the same. He did, however, acknowledge that the current trend for video games is to use the 3D camera. The camera was later implemented in an updated version of Snake Eater titled , and further installments in the franchise.|$|E

5|$|The {{director}} of has both been credited to Barry O'Neil and/or Lloyd B. Carleton by film historian Q. David Bowers. It {{is not known}} for certain who directed or if both them played a directorial {{a role in the}} production. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, Romeo and Juliet. Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company for a short time, moving to Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. The confusion between the directing credits stems from the industry practice of not crediting the film directors, even in studio news releases. There is also dispute over the cameraman credit for the film. Bower credits Blair Smith as the cameraman, but the American Film Institute adds that Carl Louis Gregory also could have been the cameraman. Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. Bowers believes that numerous releases were produced with Gregory operating the <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> the role was uncredited in the 1910 era. Anna Rosemond was one of two leading ladies for {{the first year of the}} company. Rosemond joined in the autumn of 1909 and in their first year of productions. Frank H. Crane was involved in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company from 1909. Crane's was the first leading man of the company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser.|$|E

25|$|Total body photography, which {{involves}} photographic documentation {{of as much}} body surface as possible, is often used during follow-up for high-risk patients. The technique {{has been reported to}} enable early detection and provides a cost-effective approach (with any digital <b>camera),</b> <b>but</b> its efficacy has been questioned due to its inability to detect macroscopic changes. The diagnosis method should be used in conjunction with (and not as a replacement for) dermoscopic imaging, with a combination of both methods appearing to give extremely high rates of detection.|$|E
25|$|In early 1929, Abbott visited New York City, {{ostensibly to}} find an American {{publisher}} for Atget's photographs. Upon seeing the city again, however, Abbott immediately saw its photographic potential. Accordingly, {{she went back to}} Paris, closed up her studio, and returned to New York in September. Her first photographs of the city were taken with a hand-held Kurt-Bentzin <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> soon she acquired a Century Universal camera which produced 8 x 10inch negatives. Using this large format camera, Abbott photographed New York City with the diligence and attention to detail she had so admired in Eugène Atget. Her work has provided a historical chronicle of many now-destroyed buildings and neighborhoods of Manhattan.|$|E

25|$|Panasonic {{released}} the first Micro Four Thirds camera, the Lumix DMC-G1. Several manufacturers have announced lenses {{for the new}} Micro Four Thirds mount, while older Four Thirds lenses can be mounted with an adapter (a mechanical spacer with front and rear electrical connectors and its own internal firmware). A similar mirror-less interchangeable lens <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> with an APS-C-sized sensor, was announced in January 2010: the Samsung NX10. On 21 September 2011, Nikon announced with the Nikon 1 a series of high-speed MILCs. A handful of rangefinder cameras also support interchangeable lenses. Six digital rangefinders exist: the Epson R-D1 (APS-C-sized sensor), the Leica M8 (APS-H-sized sensor), both smaller than 35mm film rangefinder cameras, and the Leica M9, M9-P, M Monochrom and M (all full-frame cameras, with the Monochrom shooting exclusively in black-and-white).|$|E
25|$|Ray Mala {{was born}} Ray Wise {{in the small}} village of Candle, Alaska to a Russian Jewish {{immigrant}} father and a Native Alaskan mother. He was born during a unique period in Alaskan history. At that time Alaska was still a territory of the United States and still a mystery to many Americans. In 1921 an explorer named Captain Frank Kleinschmidt went to Alaska on an expedition to film a picture called Primitive Love in which Mala makes his film debut at age 14. Not only does Mala act {{in front of the}} <b>camera</b> <b>but</b> he serves as a cameraman as well for the picture. From here young Mala accompanied Knud Rasmussen, the Danish Arctic explorer and writer on his trip called The Great Sled Journey from 1921 to 1924 to collect and describe Inuit songs and legends as the official cameraman.|$|E

25|$|At around 1:10p.m., Bryant got {{in line at}} {{the toll}} booth at the {{entrance}} to the historic site. Upon getting close to the toll booth, he left the line and moved to the back again. Eventually getting to the front of the line, he claimed someone had almost reversed into him. He paid the entry fee and proceeded to park near the Broad Arrow Café, near the water's edge. The site security manager told him to park with the other cars because that area was reserved for camper-vans and the car park was very busy that day. Bryant moved his car to another area and sat in his car for a few minutes. He then moved his car back near the water, outside the café. The security manager saw him go up to the café carrying a large bag and a video <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> ignored him.|$|E
25|$|The game's {{environment}} {{takes up}} 60–65% of the CPU bandwidth, {{primarily because of}} the moving <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> also because eight different characters can appear on screen at any one time – a large number for the technology of the time. Because of this, a powerful CPU was required to run the game, since the engine relied on the processor doing all the work in creating the 3D models. However, despite this limitation, the game runs at a minimum of 15 FPS, even on slow systems. The downside to this was that, since processor power at that time was limited, the in-game 3D models tended to look very pixelated, especially up-close and when motionless, due to the low amount of voxels used to display them. However, had the number of voxels been raised to increase the detail on the characters, the game would have become too slow to play, even on advanced CPUs.|$|E
25|$|Holmes was {{originally}} hired on Just Ask Jon Eakes, a home improvement show (also on HGTV and formerly in the US on sister network DIY Network) hosted by Jon Eakes, for some behind-the-scenes work. Mike Holmes approached the show's producers Scott Clark McNeil and Michael Quast {{with an idea}} for a new kind of home improvement show. Holmes did not intend that he appear on <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> the producers made this a condition of the deal. Although submissions to be on the show were initially few and far between, with Holmes doing work on small botched jobs early on in the series, the number of submissions quickly ballooned by the show's fourth season. In its last season, the show was directed by The Holmes Group's Vice President Pete Kettlewell, who had worked on the show from the first season where he did the show's audio, produced by The Holmes Group's Vice President Michael Quast, who had been with the show since the fifth season, and also produced by Mike Holmes himself.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, a British inventor, William Fox Talbot, {{had succeeded}} in making crude but {{reasonably}} light-fast silver images on paper as early as 1834 but had kept his work secret. After reading about Daguerre's invention in January 1839, Talbot published his hitherto secret method and set about improving on it. At first, like other pre-daguerreotype processes, Talbot's paper-based photography typically required hours-long exposures in the <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> in 1840 he created the calotype process, which used the chemical development of a latent image to greatly reduce the exposure needed and compete with the daguerreotype. In both its original and calotype forms, Talbot's process, unlike Daguerre's, created a translucent negative {{which could be used}} to print multiple positive copies; this is the basis of most modern chemical photography up to the present day, as Daguerreotypes could only be replicated by rephotographing them with a camera. Talbot's famous tiny paper negative of the Oriel window in Lacock Abbey, {{one of a number of}} camera photographs he made in the summer of 1835, may be the oldest camera negative in existence.|$|E
25|$|The site of {{the mass}} killing of Khojaly {{inhabitants}} was filmed on videotape by Azerbaijani journalist Chingiz Mustafayev. He was accompanied by the Russian journalist Yuri Romanov during the first helicopter flight {{to the scene of}} the tragedy. Romanov described in his memoir how he looked out of the window of the helicopter and literally jumped back from an incredibly horrible view. The whole area up to the horizon was covered with dead bodies of women, elderly people and boys and girls of all ages, from newly born to teenagers. From the mass of bodies two figures caught his sight. An old woman with uncovered gray head was lying face down next to a small girl in a blue jacket. Their legs were tied with barbed wire, and the old woman's hands were tied as well. Both were shot in their heads, and the little girl in her last move was stretching out her hands to her dead grandmother. Shocked, Romanov even forgot about his <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> after recovering from the shock started filming. However, the helicopter came under the fire, and they had to leave.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. On 19 November 1978, the magazine Ananda Vikatan criticised {{the gaps in}} the film, particularly the abundance of English dialogue, the excessive focus on naturalism, and lower standard of technical work (especially the cinematography). Despite these perceived flaws, the magazine still appreciated the film, stating that the actors immersed themselves into their characters, leading to them not really acting before the <b>camera</b> <b>but</b> living the characters. K. Balamurugan of Rediff said, [...] "It was {{what we would call}} parallel cinema these days." ...|$|E
