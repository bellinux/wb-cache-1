5|$|In the mid-1980s, several sets of <b>communication</b> <b>protocols</b> {{emerged to}} fill the gaps between the data-link layer and the {{application}} layer of the OSI reference model. These included Appletalk, IPX, and NetBIOS with the dominant protocol set during the early 1990s being IPX due to its popularity with MS-DOS users. TCP/IP existed at this point, but it was typically only used by large government and research facilities.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, first-generation {{symmetric}} multiprocessing (SMP) clients were publicly released for open beta testing, {{referred to as}} SMP1. These clients used Message Passing Interface (MPI) <b>communication</b> <b>protocols</b> for parallel processing, as {{at that time the}} GROMACS cores were not designed to be used with multiple threads. This was the first time a distributed computing project had used MPI. Although the clients performed well in Unix-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS, they were troublesome under Windows. On January24, 2010, SMP2, the second generation of the SMP clients and the successor to SMP1, was released as an open beta and replaced the complex MPI with a more reliable thread-based implementation.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Communication</b> <b>Protocol</b> Software was {{developed}} at the NASA Lewis Research Center to support the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite High Burst Rate Link Evaluation Terminal (ACTS HBR-LET). The HBR-LET is an experimenters terminal {{to communicate with the}} ACTS for various experiments by government, university, and industry agencies. The <b>Communication</b> <b>Protocol</b> Software is one segment of the Control and Performance Monitor (C&PM) Software system of the HBR-LET. The <b>Communication</b> <b>Protocol</b> Software allows users to control and configure the Intermediate Frequency Switch Matrix (IFSM) on board the ACTS to yield a desired path through the spacecraft payload. Besides IFSM control, the C&PM Software System is also responsible for instrument control during HBR-LET experiments, uplink power control of the HBR-LET to demonstrate power augmentation during signal fade events, and data display.

Smith joined the Final Fantasy XII project after Yasumi Matsuno, the original director, had left and was not able to collaborate on the script with him directly, unlike with Vagrant Story. Principal voice recording took place over eight weeks, with months of translation work both before and after that. Smith worked with Matsuno again on the 2011 PlayStation Portable remake of , which received a brand new translation. In 2011, Smith co-founded a book translation and publishing company called Bento Books with his friend Tony Gonzalez and his Kajiya Productions partner Joseph Reeder.
