5|$|Although argon is non-toxic, it is 38% denser than air and {{therefore}} considered a dangerous asphyxiant in <b>closed</b> <b>areas.</b> It {{is difficult to}} detect because it is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. A 1994 incident, in which a man was asphyxiated after entering an argon-filled section of oil pipe under construction in Alaska, highlights the dangers of argon tank leakage in confined spaces and emphasizes the need for proper use, storage and handling.|$|E
25|$|The Fishing Rules specify {{seasonal}} closures, <b>closed</b> <b>areas,</b> {{restrictions on}} specific gears such as retricting mesh sizes, minimum catch sizes, and restricted levels of allowable bycatch. Fisheries management has been changing since Soviet times, and further changes are likely.|$|E
25|$|Backstage {{areas are}} <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> of attraction, store, and {{restaurant}} buildings, {{as well as}} outdoor service areas located behind such buildings. Although {{some areas of the}} park, particularly New Orleans Square, have underground operations and storage areas, there is no park-wide network of subterranean tunnels, such as Walt Disney World's utilidors.|$|E

For {{those who are}} not residents within the Frontier <b>Closed</b> <b>Area,</b> and are not crossing the border, a <b>Closed</b> <b>Area</b> Permit is required.

25|$|For various reasons, {{including}} maintenance costs, {{decreases in}} ridership, along with crime and safety issues, many stations have fare control areas, mezzanine areas and entrances {{that have been}} closed. Many mezzanines that previously stretched {{the entire length of}} a station have been split or partitioned by fencing or permanent walls. These <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> have been abandoned or converted into space for Transit Operations or the New York City Police Department.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a small amount of tourism, mainly {{associated}} with anglers interested in lagoon fishing (for bonefish in particular) or offshore fishing. Week-long ecotourism packages during which some of the normally <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> can be visited are also available. In recent years, surfers have discovered that there are good waves during the Northern Hemisphere's winter season and there are interests developing to service these recreational tourists. There is some tourism-related infrastructure, such as a small hotel, rental facilities, and takeaways.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{sturgeon}} {{has been}} an important catch in the basin of the Sea of Azov and the Caspian Sea, and in Siberian Rivers and the Amur River. Currently, sturgeon stocks are heavily depleted and under constant pressure from poaching. Inland fisheries are regulated by the Law on Fisheries discussed above. However, few provisions refer specifically to inland fisheries, although there are specific regulations for same catchments and river systems. These regulations specify <b>closed</b> <b>areas,</b> seasonal closures, gear restrictions, minimum mesh sizes and minimum catch size.|$|E

25|$|The {{formation}} of the neural plate starts when dorsal mesoderm signals ectodermal cells above it to lengthen into columnar neural plate cells. This different shape distinguishes {{the cells of the}} presumptive neural plate from other pre-epidermal cells. If the neural plate is separated by itself, it will still develop to make a thinner plate but will not form a neural tube. If the region containing presumptive epidermis and neural plate tissue is isolated, small neural folds will form. Elongation that occurs throughout the {{formation of}} the neural plate and closure of the neural tube is vital; the closing areas of the neural tube are seen to have very increased elongation activity in the midline compared to already <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> when the plate was beginning to shape itself into a tube.|$|E
25|$|Constructed in 1979, the {{building}} was named the Prince of Wales Building. It housed the head office of the British Army stationed in Hong Kong until the territory's handover to the People's Republic of China on 1 July 1997 when it was made the head office of the PLA Hong Kong Garrison. In May 2000, the Legislative Council of Hong Kong passed the Military Installations <b>Closed</b> <b>Areas</b> (Amendment) Order 2000, which renamed the former Prince of Wales Barracks to Central Barracks, and the Prince of Wales Building to the Chinese People's Liberation Army Forces Hong Kong Building. After the base became the Central Barracks, the old name of {{the building}} remained visible in large raised letters {{along the bottom of}} the tower for several years. The building underwent a 20-month full renovation, completed in 2014, during which most of the troops have been transferred to the Stonecutters Island base.|$|E
2500|$|The Oceano State Vehicular Recreation Area {{has taken}} {{measures}} to protect wildlife by fencing off specific areas from pedestrians and vehicles and creating rules for visitors. Some rules are: adhere to the [...] speed limit, do not enter <b>closed</b> <b>areas,</b> keep dogs on a leash at all times, and rid the beach of trash that could attract predators. During the busy holidays, extra rangers are brought into the park to ensure rules are enforced.|$|E

50|$|An {{executive}} order {{was made by}} the Chief Executive under section 36 of the Public Order Ordinance (POO) (Cap. 245) to turn these places into a <b>closed</b> <b>area.</b> Under the order, the Commissioner of Police may grant permission to individuals to enter or leave the <b>closed</b> <b>area.</b> Holders of accreditation badges, including MC6 delegates, local and overseas journalists, representatives of non-governmental organisations, support staff, staff and tenants of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre were allowed to enter or leave the <b>closed</b> <b>area</b> during the closure period. Other people who needed to enter the <b>closed</b> <b>area</b> for justifiable reasons applied for permits from the police.|$|R
50|$|The {{frontier}} area was further adjusted with the Frontier <b>Closed</b> <b>Area</b> Order 1984, gazetted on 7 September 1984. The amendments reflected {{the relocation of}} the Man Kam To Control Point, and also completely excluded Lei Uk Village from the <b>closed</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R
50|$|These <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> do not {{prohibit}} all fishing, {{rather they}} prevent the further degradation of benthic habitat and groundfish species. <b>Closed</b> <b>areas</b> {{are different than}} Marine Protected Areas (MPA) because they allow some forms of fishing and other activities to occur that would normally not be allowed in MPA.|$|E

50|$|The {{demographic}} factor, {{coupled with}} landownership data, led, for example, to litigation between the Devils Lake Sioux and the State of North Dakota, where non-Indians owned more acreage than tribal members even though more Native Americans resided {{on the reservation}} than non-Indians. The court decision turned, in part, on the perception of Indian character, contending that the tribe did not have jurisdiction over the alienated allotments. In a number of instances—e.g., the Yakama Indian Reservation—tribes have identified open and <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> within reservations. One finds the majority of non-Indian landownership and residence in the open areas and, contrariwise, <b>closed</b> <b>areas</b> represent exclusive tribal residence and related conditions.|$|E
