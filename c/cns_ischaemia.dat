40|$|Reducing body {{temperature}} of rodents {{has been found}} to improve their survival to ischaemia, hypoxia, chemical toxicants, and many other types of insults. Larger species, including humans, may also benefit from a lower {{body temperature}} when recovering from <b>CNS</b> <b>ischaemia</b> and other traumatic insults. Rodents subjected to these insults undergo a regulated hypothermic response (that is, decrease in set point temperature) characterised by preference for cooler ambient temperatures, peripheral vasodilatation, and reduced metabolic rate. However, forced hypothermia (that is, body temperature forced below set point) is the only method used in the study and treatment of human pathological insults. The therapeutic efficacy of the hypothermic treatment is likely to be influenced {{by the nature of the}} reduction in body temperature (that is, forced versus regulated). Homeostatic mechanisms counter forced reductions in body temperature resulting in physiological stress and decreased efficacy of the hypothermic treatment. On the other hand, regulated hypothermia would seem to be the best means of achieving a therapeutic benefit because thermal homeostatic systems mediate a controlled reduction in core temperature...|$|E
40|$|Neural {{cell death}} plays {{a crucial role}} in the {{pathogenesis}} of various ischaemic disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), most prominently stroke, causing very significant mortality and morbidity. Severe ischaemia rapidly kills both neurons and astrocytes, two CNS cell types whose interactions are essential to normal brain functioning, so ideally a target needs to be found which will protect both. Glutamate mediated excitotoxicity, the process whereby excessive extracellular glutamate causes cell death via the over-activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors, is known to operate during ischaemia. However, there is increasing evidence that ATP mediated excitotoxicity may also occur. Using an in vitro model of ischaemia (oxygen-glucose deprivation: OGD) and various murine primary cortical cell cultures, I investigated the hypothesis that parallel pathways of ATP and glutamate mediated excitotoxicity contribute to the death of both astrocytes and neurons during ischaemia. OGD produced rapid and significant ATP and glutamate release from co-cultures of astrocytes and neurons, as measured using microelectrode biosensors. Glutamate release was mainly from astrocytes, whereas the cellular origin of ATP was less clear. Ca 2 + imaging of Fura- 2 loaded cells confirmed functional P 2 receptor expression in all astrocytes and 60 % of neurons along with glutamate receptor expression in all neurons but only a small proportion of astrocytes. During OGD, blocking NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptors significantly reduced neuronal death, while non-selective P 2 receptor antagonists as well as selective P 2 Y 1 (but not P 2 X 7) receptor antagonists prevented the death of both neurons and astrocytes. Furthermore, a synergistic protective effect was produced by combining low concentrations of P 2 and glutamate receptor antagonists, reducing cell death to control levels. These results suggest that ATP and glutamate, acting at P 2 and ionotropic glutamate receptors, are the main mediators of early cell death during severe <b>CNS</b> <b>ischaemia,</b> and thus represent a potential target for powerful neuroprotective strategies.

40|$|Prolonged {{perinatal}} ischaemia is {{an important}} factor in the development of periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), which is the most common white matter pathology associated with cerebral palsy (CP) : approximately 1. 5 to 2. 5 per 1, 000 live births per year suffer from CP. During central nervous system (<b>CNS)</b> <b>ischaemia,</b> there is an excessive accumulation of extracellular neurotransmitters. Ischaemia affects axons and glial cells of white matter, which occupy approximately 50 % of the human brain. The mechanisms of ischaemic-induced injury in astrocytes vary at different ages. Ischaemic injury in postnatal day 0 (P 0) of rat optic nerve (RON) astrocytes is Ca[superscript 2 +]-dependent and mediated by voltage-gated Ca[superscript 2 +] channels (VGCCs). Astrocytes are replete with neurotransmitter receptors. Using an ex vivo model of ischaemia (oxygen-glucose deprivation: OGD) and Ca[superscript 2 +] imaging, I investigated the role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, nicotine and norepinephrine in P 0 RON during ischaemia. OGD produced a rapid and significant increase in cell death. A GABA antagonist (picrotoxin), a glycine antagonist (strychnine) and their combination protected P 0 RON astrocytes from ischaemic injury. They reduced the total percentage of cell death and postponed the initial cell death. Immunohistochemistry revealed that GABA and glycine receptors are expressed by astrocytes and axons in P 0 RON. On the other hand, blocking nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs: mecamylamine or α-bungarotoxin) or blocking adrenergic receptors (combination of propranolol and phentolamine) had no effect. Using a glial injury scoring system, ultrastructural studies confirmed the protective action of picrotoxin and strychnine against ischaemia, which cannot be achieved by mecamylamine or a combination of propranolol and phentolamine. Chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (NG 2) (+) cells are a distinct type of glial cell which, over time, have come to be known as the fourth type of glia. These cells are distributed throughout the developing and adult CNS, and are known to be mitotically active even in the adult CNS. The astrocyte fate of NG 2 (+) cells is a matter of debate. In the current study, the focus was on studying the morphological features of NG 2 (+) cells at the ultrastructural level and under confocal microscope, and more precisely their relation to astrocytes in nRON following post-embedding immunolabelling. Immuno-electron microscope (I-EM) revealed NG 2 immunoreactivity in nRON astrocytes. Double immunolabelling showed an overlap between NG 2 (+) and (glial fibrillary acidic protein) GFAP (+) populations in nRON, adult RON and cortical grey matter.

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{evidence}} supports the notion that excitotoxicity {{plays a major role}} in the pathogenesis of a number of neurological diseases, including central nervous system (<b>CNS)</b> <b>ischaemia,</b> Alzheimer's disease, motor neurone disease, and glaucoma. In the global population 60 years of age and over, these diseases are among the leading causes of mortality and morbidity. Although the site of excitotoxic injury is principally at the level of the cell body (perikaryal), understanding the secondary effects on the neuronal axon is important because axonopathy is a documented early feature of these common neurological conditions; hence, an understanding of the pattern and mechanisms of secondary axonal degeneration after excitotoxic perikaryal injury could provide novel detection and treatment strategies in the early phase of neurological disease. The retina and optic nerve, as approachable regions of the CNS, provide a unique anatomical substrate to investigate axonal degeneration after perikaryal excitotoxic injury. Spatiotemporal changes in the retina and optic nerve were studied after injection of 20 nM of Nmethyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) in the left eye of the rat with the saline-injected right eye serving as the control. Temporal changes in the morphology of retina and optic nerve were studied by light and electron microscopy. Progressive retinal damage beginning at 72 hrs, seen as thinning of the inner retina and cell loss in the ganglion cell layer, showed strong correlation (R= 0. 949) with degenerative changes in the optic nerve; the distal optic nerve segment displayed significantly more axon loss, axon swellings and myelin damage than the proximal segment (p< 0. 05), suggestive of a 'dying-back type degeneration'. Beginning at 24 hrs, electron microscopy demonstrated various features of necrosis in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) : mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum swelling, disintegration of polyribosomes, rupture of membranous organelle and formation of myelin bodies. Ultrastructural damage in the optic nerve, which began at 72 hrs, mimicked the changes of Wallerian degeneration, where early nodal-paranodal disturbances were followed by the appearance of three major morphological variants: watery degeneration, dark degeneration, and demyelination. Features suggestive of RGC regeneration in the form of dendritic sprouting after acute excitotoxic injury were also demonstrated at day 7. Immunohistochemistry revealed glial cell responses and changes to the axon transport system. Excitotoxic injury resulted in progressive activation of macroglia (Müller cells and astrocytes) and microglial cells in the retina and optic nerve as demonstrated by increased glial-fibrillary-acidic protein (GFAP) and ED- 1 immunolabelling as early as 72 hrs. Interxonal glial cells in the optic nerve also showed increased β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) beginning at 72 hrs. Impairment of slow axonal transport at 72 hrs resulted in decrease anterograde transport of neurofilament-light (NF-L) to the axon terminal and hence their accumulation in proximal neuron (seen as NF-L rich spheroids). This fundamental research revealed a pathological picture of Wallerian-like degeneration after perikaryal excitotoxic injury in the CNS. This novel finding is consistent with recent evidence of a labile axonal 'survival' factor, nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2,(Nmnat 2) produced by the neuronal cell body. Further study is required to test the hypothesis that a lack of Nmnat 2 is the mechanism by which axons degenerate after excitotoxic perikaryal injury. Thesis (Ph. D.)
