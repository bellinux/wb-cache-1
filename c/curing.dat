5|$|Aging / Curing: While {{not always}} {{required}}, some teas required additional aging, secondary fermentation, or baking {{to reach their}} drinking potential. For instance, a green tea puerh, prior to <b>curing</b> into a post-fermented tea, is often bitter and harsh in taste, but becomes sweet and mellow through fermentation by age or dampness. Additionally, oolong can benefit from aging if fired over charcoal. Flavoured teas are manufactured in this stage by spraying the tea with aromas and flavours or by storing them with their flavorants.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. The {{effect of}} {{variation}} in autoclave pressure, <b>cure</b> temperature, and vacuum-application time on porosity, hot/wet (H/W) and room temperature/dry (RT/D) short beam shear (SBS) strengths, and failure mechanisms of IM 7 / 977 - 2 unidirectional prepreg was investigated. The stacking sequence for all panels was [00 / 902 / 0] 4 s. Fourteen <b>cure</b> cycles were designed to study {{a wide range of}} <b>cure</b> pressures, <b>cure</b> temperatures, and two different vacuum-application durations, including vacuum vent at recommended pressure and vacuum hold throughout the <b>cure</b> cycle. It was found that for panels <b>cured</b> at different temperatures and for panels <b>cured</b> at different pressures with a vacuum vent at recommended pressure, SBS strength did not vary significantly over a relatively wide range of <b>cure</b> temperatures and pressures. However, after a certain point, a decreasing trend in the average SBS strength for both H/W and RT/D was observed by reducing the <b>cure</b> temperature as well as the <b>cure</b> pressure. Panels with the same <b>cure</b> pressure and dissimilar vacuum-application durations showed different SBS strength, with higher properties associated with panels in which the vacuum was vented at the recommended pressure. For panels <b>cured</b> at various <b>cure</b> pressures and the vacuum hold throughout the <b>cure</b> cycles, C-scan results showed a cross-shaped high-porosity {{in the middle of the}} panels, which became larger as the <b>cure</b> pressure decreased. This defect is believed to cause higher variability of the SBS strength as the <b>cure</b> pressure is reduced. SBS strength was found to decrease with increasing void content in the test specimens. Theoretical models were compared to the experimental data of SBS strength vs. void content. Investigation of the failure mode for each panel revealed a change in both H/W and RT/D failure mechanism by lowering the <b>cure</b> temperature and <b>cure</b> pressure. However, the change was more dominant when the <b>cure</b> temperature was varied...|$|R
5|$|For {{the scene}} in which Ash is {{revealed}} to be an android, a puppet was created of the character's torso and upper body which was operated from underneath.

However, the latex of the head shrank while <b>curing</b> {{and the result was}} not entirely convincing. For the bulk of the scene, Holm knelt under the table with his head coming up through a hole. Milk, caviar, pasta, fiber optics, and glass marbles were combined to form the android's innards.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{stochastic}} <b>cure</b> simulation methodology {{is developed}} and implemented {{to investigate the}} influence of <b>cure</b> kinetics uncertainty due to different initial resin state {{on the process of}} <b>cure.</b> The simulation addresses heat transfer effects and allows quantification of uncertainty in temperature overshoot during the <b>cure.</b> Differential Scanning Calorimetry was used to characterise <b>cure</b> kinetics variability of a commercial epoxy resin used in aerospace applications.

A <b>cure</b> simulation model was coupled with conventional Monte Carlo and an implementation of the Probabilistic Collocation Method. Both simulation schemes are capable of capturing variability propagation, with the collocation method presenting benefits in terms of computational cost against the Monte Carlo scheme with comparable accuracy.
