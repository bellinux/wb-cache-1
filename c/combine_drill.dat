40|$|Because of {{the rapid}} {{depletion}} of water and shortage of labor, farmers in many Asian regions are moving from puddled transplanted rice to dry-seeded rice. However, weed infestations are a serious problem in dry-seeded rice systems because dry cultivation practices and aerobic soil conditions are conducive to the germination and growth of weeds. A field {{study was conducted in}} the wet season of 2011 and the dry season of 2012 to evaluate the effect of two rice cultivars and different herbicides on weed growth and rice yield under dry-seeded rice. The rice cultivars (one hybrid and one inbred) were dry-seeded at 20 - 22 kgseedha- 1 with a <b>combine</b> <b>drill</b> fitted with knife-point openers. Rice plant densities ranged from 44 to 56 plantsm- 2 in the first season and from 67 to 77 plantsm- 2 in the second season. Weed density, weed biomass, rice panicle number, and rice yield were not influenced by the cultivars; however, they were strongly influenced by the weed control treatments. In terms of percent, the hybrid cultivar had 11 - 12 % higher yield than the inbred cultivar. Weed competition in the control plots (one hand-weeding) lowered yield by 39 - 41 % compared with the weed-free plots. All herbicides significantly reduced weed biomass compared with the control treatment, providing 75 - 93 % weed control. Herbicide-treated plots had similar grain yield and the yield in these plots was 76 - 86 % of the yield of the weed-free plots (4. 2 - 4. 4 tha- 1), suggesting further scope to improve rice yield in dry-seeded systems. Compared with the control treatment (one hand-weeding), herbicide-treated plots had 27 - 41 % greater yield. Future research in dry-seeded rice systems should focus on the integration of appropriate agronomic practices with herbicide application timing and combinations to improve the effectiveness of weed management practices...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} field {{experiments}} were {{conducted at the}} research farm of The University of Agriculture Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan during 2009 - 10 and 2010 - 2011, to investigate the effects of different tillage practices and sowing methods on productivity of wheat and mungbean cropping system on silty clay loam soil. The factors consisted of tillage practices i. e. tine cultivator twice plowed (TC 2), chisels plow followed by rotovator (CR), mouldboard plow followed by rotovator (MR), disk plow followed by rotovator (DR) and tine cultivator followed by rotovator (TCR) in the main plots and sowing methods i. e. sowing with single box seed drill (SD), combined drill (CD) and broadcast (BC) in the sub plots. The performance of different tillage implements during seedbed preparation in term of soil depth of cut, wheel slippage, fuel consumption and effective field capacity were statistically significant. Maximum soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depth recorded with CR and MR tillage practices, while maximum soil bulk density, soil penetration resistance, at 20 and 40 cm depth, fresh and dry weed biomass were obtained in plots tilled with tine cultivator twice (TC- 2). However, minimum soil penetration resistance and fresh/ dry weed biomass were obtained in plots of CR and MR tillage practices, respectively. Higher soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depth was observed when sowing was done with seed drill and combined drill, respectively. Data regarding wheat crop indicated that higher number of tillers m- 2 (403) and grain yield (4. 6 t ha- 1) were obtained in plots tilled with disk plow followed by rotavator. Similarly, maximum biological yield (10. 4 t ha- 1) was recorded in plots that were tilled with mouldboard plow followed by rotavator. Sowing by combined seed drill resulted in higher emergence, number of tillers, straw yield and biological yield. Similarly, higher number of grains spike- 1, spike length, grain yield and harvest indices were recorded when sowing was done with seed drill. Maximum total nitrogen in soil was noted in plots tilled with tine cultivator followed by rotavator. Similarly, sowing by seed drill and <b>combine</b> <b>drill</b> recorded greater total nitrogen in soil and wheat straw. The data relating to mungbean crop indicated that chisel plow followed by rotavator resulted in higher soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depths, higher emergence m- 2, plant height, pod length and total nitrogen in grains. Plots tilled with tine cultivator twice delayed flowering and maturity, increase in fresh and dry weed biomass, soil bulk density at 20 and 40 cm depth and soil penetration resistance at 20 and 40 cm depths. Number of branch plant - 1, pods plant - 1, biological yield, soil total nitrogen were higher in plots tilled with moldboard plow followed by rotavator. The maximum grain yield of mungbean and soil organic matter were recorded in plots tilled with tine cultivator followed by rotavator. Similarly, maximum harvest indices and total nitrogen in straw were recorded in plots tilled with disk plow followed by rotavator. Higher emergence, plant height, pod length, hundred grain weight, grain yield, biological yield, harvest indices, total soil nitrogen, and total nitrogen in mungbean grain and straw were recorded in plots sown with seed drill. Plots sown with broadcast method delayed flowering and maturity, increase fresh and dry weed biomass and greater soil bulk density at 20 and 40 cm depths. Number of branch plant - 1, pods plant- 1, soil organic matter and total nitrogen in soil were greater in plots that were sown with a combined seed drill. Economic analysis of wheat and mungbean showed that maximum net revenue of wheat was obtained with mouldboard plow followed by rotavator (MR) tillage practices and the highest net revenue of mungbean was found with tine cultivator followed by rotavator (TCR) while minimum net revenue were obtained with tine cultivator (TC- 2). Similarly, sowing by seed drill (SD) and <b>combine</b> <b>drill</b> (CD) resulted in maximum net revenue as compared to broadcast (BC) sowing method. It is concluded from the studies that all tillage implements when followed by rotavator for seedbed preparation resulted better yield and net economic revenue from wheat and mungbean crops {{as compared to the}} sole used of tine cultivator plowed twice. Similarly sowing by seed drill and combined drill showed a higher grain yield and net revenue than broadcast methods...|$|E

Has been considered and justified the rational parameters of close-set drilling technology of dimension stones. Solution is offered that consist the <b>combined</b> <b>drilling</b> (a close-set and a holes line drilling), that provides to increase of stone splitting efficiency under its own weight. The calculation of {{the parameters of the}} scheme of partial underdrilling at a monolith of stone with the purpose of reducing the volume of drilling works is given. Diagrams of tensile stress changes depending on the specific area of splitting were built. A rational correlation between the drilling parameters of the holes has been established by solving the problems of loading the cantilever beam and stress concentration by the Kirsch solution. The most important parameter for the implementation of this technology is the ratio of monoloth hight to its length. Engineering formulas are proposed for calculating the technological parameters of the realization of the “gravitational-hole” stone splitting. The configuration of a rough block of stones is determined under which this technology can be realized. Creating of close-set holes provides the increase of maximal tensile stress with equal values of specific splitting area ratio.
