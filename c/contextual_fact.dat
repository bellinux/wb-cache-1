Such a context-sensitive authorization scheme is necessary when a mobile user moves across multiple administrative domains where they are not registered in advance. Also, users interacting with their environment need a non-intrusive way to access resources, and clues about their context may be useful input into authorization policies for these resources.

40|$|Pragmatic deficits {{of persons}} with autism {{spectrum}} disorders [ASDs] are often traced back to a dysfunction in Theory of Mind. However, {{the exact nature of}} the link between pragmatics and mindreading in autism is unclear. Pragmatic deficits in ASDs are not homogenous: in particular, while inter-subjective dimensions are affected, some other pragmatic capacities seem to be relatively preserved. Moreover, failure on classical false-belief tasks stems from executive problems that go beyond belief attribution; false-belief tasks require taking an alternative perspective on the reality. While this capacity is functional in typically developing young children, it is impaired in ASDs. Typically developing children are capable of taking their interlocutor's perspective into account when communicating, whereas poor cognitive flexibility makes it difficult for persons with ASDs to grasp the inter-subjective character of communicative stimuli. This analysis predicts that those pragmatic processes that amount to merely taking into account salient <b>contextual</b> <b>facts</b> during utterance interpretation, without necessarily adopting the interlocutor's perspective, may be preserved in ASDs.

5000|$|Giving {{the advice}} of the Privy Council, Lord Hoffmann set out the {{principles}} for interpretation of a company's articles such as this. He stated that the same principles of interpretation apply whether it is a company's constitution, a contract or an Act of Parliament. A court should search for the meaning of any such document with all relevant <b>contextual</b> <b>facts</b> in mind, and consider the meaning it would convey to a reasonable person. He emphasised it was not relevant, in cases where a gap was left, what the parties hypothetically [...] "would have" [...] concluded, a hypothetical inquiry which he referred to as [...] "barren". The important point was to ask what interpretation, and implication would be consistent with the scheme of the company constitution (or contract or Act of Parliament). For this reason, Lord Hoffmann agreed with Conteh CJ that the directors could be removed. The scheme of the privatisation programme was to balance the interests of the government and private investors according to their economic interest. As such, it would have been absurd that just because the special share and the possession of 37.5% of ordinary shares had become disjointed that the incumbent directors would be irremovable. So given the gap in the articles, it was consistent with the scheme of the company's articles that the two directors in question would be appointable by the government. Lord Hoffmann's advice on the law read as follows.|$|R

The authors will argue {{that much of the}} literature on this topic has stopped one step short of critically engaging with the ubiquitous and thus meaningful ‘religion versus culture’ paradigm.

The authors' focus is on ‘religion versus culture’ as an important historically <b>contextual</b> social <b>fact,</b> but argue that further research needs to be carried out to properly evaluate the effectiveness of such paradigm on courses of action relating to marriage (and implicitly to education and other lifestyle choices). The authors recommend that interviewee recruitment should include women before and after marriage, and that the researchers should approach the ethics of their data interpretation differently if they want to go beyond the sanitised narratives that are, according to this paper, crucially influenced by the role Muslim women feel they play in giving Islam a positive public image, the postcolonial context and the generational tensions among British Pakistanis...|$|R

30|$|Another {{important}} {{problem of}} conventional decision tree-clustered acoustic modeling is difficulty in capturing {{the effect of}} weak contextual factors such as word-level emphasis [23, 36]. It is mainly because weak contexts have less influence on the likelihood measure [23]. One clear approach {{to address this issue}} is to construct the decision tree in two successive steps [36]. In the first step, all selections are done among weak contextual factors, and in the second step, the remaining questions are adopted [36]. This procedure can effectively exploit weak contextual factors, but it leads to a reduction in the amount of training data available for normal contextual factors. Context adaptive training with factorized decision trees [23] is another approach that can exploit weak context questions efficiently. In this system, a canonical model is trained using normal contextual factors and then a set of transforms is built by weak <b>contextual</b> factors. In <b>fact,</b> canonical models and transforms, respectively, represent the effects of normal and weak contextual factors [23]. However, this structure also improves context generalization of conventional HMM-based synthesis by exploiting adaptation techniques.|$|R

Not only have new technologies available both in and out of school developed rapidly, but the way that they have developed and the kind of devices which have emerged have moved faster than educational research and perhaps more importantly, pedagogical approaches. The concept of ICT has broadened and is now often referred to in some forums as digital technologies. The notion of the digital divide is no longer being discussed solely in terms of lack of access to technology but in terms of bandwidth. A whole new technological language has become embedded in our vocabulary. There is further confusion about the nature of learning itself.

40|$|Though {{instrumental}} in numerous disciplines, context has no universally accepted definition. In specialized knowledge resources it is timely and necessary to parameterize context {{with a view}} to more effectively facilitating knowledge representation, understanding, and acquisition, the main aims of terminological knowledge bases. This entails distinguishing different types of context as well as how they interact with each other. This is not a simple objective to achieve despite the fact that specialized discourse does not have as many contextual variables as those in general language (i. e. figurative meaning, irony, etc.). Even in specialized text, context is an extremely complex concept. In <b>fact,</b> <b>contextual</b> information can be specified in terms of scope or according to the type of information conveyed. It can be a textual excerpt or a whole document; a pragmatic convention or a whole culture; a concrete situation or a prototypical scenario.

In this paper we propose a taxonomy of context primarily based on scope (local and global) and further divided into syntactic, semantic and pragmatic facets. These facets cover the specification of different types of terminological information, such as predicate-argument structure, collocations, semantic relations, term variants, grammatical and lexical cohesion, communicative situations, subject fields and cultures...|$|R
40|$|The hypertextual {{edition of}} Informatio status Marchie anconitane means to offer, through an {{organized}} network of links, a better possibility {{to read and}} use the documentary text. The Informatio is {{a report on the}} political conditions of the Marca anconitana drawn up in June 1341 by a Papal legate on the order of Pope Benedetto XII. In order to draw up the report, the Papal legate carried out a research in several centres of the Marca and consulted about 60 people. Therefore, the text is essentially formed by a series of evidences with information and opinions about the government of the Papal monarchy in the area. The evidences are all based on the same inquisitorial articles proposed by the legate. In the witnesses and in the people mentioned in the evidences it is possible to identify the protagonists of the historical scene of the Marca {{during the first half of}} the 14 th century. It comes from this last aspect the idea that an hypertextual edition could offer a precious opportunity to read in a more effective way a text that both in the structure and in its contents can be defìned as 'circular'. The editions means to establish a constant relation among the textual aspects, the historical fact and the interpretation. For this reason it is accompanied by a traditional essay that wants to reproduce a political geography of Marca during the fìrst half of the 14 th century and that especially means to study the systems the people involved in the research used to express the awareness oft he political situation of their time.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to explore}} sensory engagements with {{material}} objects. In other words, it investigates the physical encounter between {{a person and}} a thing, particularly through {{a focus on the}} sense of touch. It does so within the art gallery context. It looks at the capacity of such embodied practices to inspire creative response to objects, an approach which, the thesis argues, does not necessarily rely on knowing <b>contextual</b> information or <b>fact,</b> but rather allows for responses including imagining and making. The research coins the term ‘material interpretation’ to describe such an approach to the interpretive process. The work is interdisciplinary in nature: building on studies of materiality in the museum context, it draws especially from sensory anthropology and studies of material culture. Significantly however, the research develops an entirely new field of critical dialogue. Uniquely and unusually, by bringing museology together with concepts from the discipline of theology, the thesis develops an unprecedented approach to exploring interpretation practice through a lens of what it calls ‘theological museology’. Arising from the researcher’s professional practice and experience of interpretation projects in which such sensory engagements with objects were given priority, the research comes from a practical grounding. As such it argues that material practices be embedded within the institution through a strategic approach to creative and inclusive interpretation. The research takes a qualitative approach and is based on case studies. These include exploring a collection in storage (the Mary Greg collection at Manchester Art Gallery); projects based on artist-made interpretive objects called Object Dialogue Boxes (including at Museums Sheffield); and the creative use of a city’s handling collection (the Artemis Collection in Leeds) ...|$|R

Clifton and Kent later presented constructions of non-contextual hidden variable theories which, they argued, indeed simulate quantum mechanics in this way (Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. A 456 (2000) 2101). These arguments have evoked some controversy. Among other things, {{it has been suggested that}} the Clifton-Kent models do not in fact reproduce correctly the predictions of quantum mechanics, even when finite precision is taken into account. It has also been suggested that careful analysis of the notion of contextuality in the context of finite precision measurement motivates definitions which imply that the Clifton-Kent models are in <b>fact</b> <b>contextual.</b> Several critics have also argued that the issue can be definitively resolved by experimental tests of the Kochen-Specker theorem or experimental demonstrations of the contextuality of Nature. One aim of this paper is to respond to and rebut criticisms of the Meyer-Clifton-Kent papers. We thus elaborate in a little more detail how the Clifton-Kent models can reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics to arbitrary precision. We analyse in more detail the relationship between classicality, finite precision measurement and contextuality, and defend the claims that the Clifton-Kent models are both essentially classical and non-contextual. We also examine in more detail the senses in which a theory can be said to be contextual or non-contextual, and in which an experiment can be said to provide evidence on the point. In particular, we criticise the suggestion that a decisive experimental verification of contextuality is possible, arguing that the idea rests on a conceptual confusion. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

We rarely see an isolated visual stimulus all alone by itself. Rather, the stimulus {{tends to be}} surrounded by spatial and temporal context, which often affect both the perception and cortical responses to the target stimulus. The <b>contextual</b> information in <b>fact</b> can be fairly rich, and its effects can be very complex, which in many cases have not been fully explored. This thesis uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), psychophysics, and computational modeling to examine the effects and functions of the contextual modulation especially beyond local features. In Chapters 2 and 3, two sets of experiments considering a larger context including the global shape complexity and figure-ground segregation are used to reconcile competing branches of the literature in terms of the cortical response patterns of early visual areas. In particular, those cortical responses to coherent structure-from-motion stimuli or circular contours vary dramatically depending on the global context. In Chapters 4 and 5, two sets of psychophysical experiments use the tilt illusion and the shape distortion, respectively, as probes to further explore the functions of local and global context. Overall, the ability to take account larger context ensures the system would dynamically adjust weights between an efficient representation and a strategy to emphasize targets and indicate certainty in early visual areas. Additionally, a stronger perceptual grouping cue between the target and its surround or a larger uncertainty of the center target would enhance the contextual modulation and increase perceptual biases, which would potentially increase the sensitivity of visual system to feature discrepancies, and it would {{play an important role in}} visual search and detection...|$|R
40|$|Hypertension is {{a serious}} medical condition. Although {{men and women of}} all racial groups in the US suffer from high blood pressure, black women have the highest rates of hypertension. For instance, the age-adjusted {{prevalence}} of hypertension among black women ages 20 and over is 44. 3, compared to 28. 1 among white women, 40. 5 among black men, and 31. 1 among white men. Past research has focused on SES and behavioral factors as potential explanations for blood pressure disparities between black and white women. But, even after controlling for such factors, considerable disparities remain. The goal of this research is to examine cultural and social factors that have been shown to increase blood pressure. Specifically, I examine social support, psychosocial characteristics, and contextual factors associated with race/ethnicity and hypertension, in hopes of explaining some of the disparities in high blood pressure between black and white women. iii Using data from Waves I, III, and IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), I estimated a sequence of multinomial logistic regression models predicting prehypertension and hypertension in young adulthood. Cross-sectional models show that racial disparities in hypertension remain after controlling for social support, psychosocial characteristics, and <b>contextual</b> factors. In <b>fact,</b> the only covariate that substantially reduced the racial disparity in hypertension was body mass index (BMI), a fairly reliable measure of body fatness for most people. I also estimated a set of multinomial logistic regression models predicting odds of prehypertension and hypertension by adolescent and cumulative social support, as well as psychosocial, contextual, and behavioral factors. These models were included to determine if early life and/or cumulative factors and conditions would help explain racial blood pressure disparities not explained by adulthood factors. Findings show that none of the early life or cumulative social support, psychosocial, contextual, or behavioral factors helped to explain racial differences in prehypertension or hypertension. Even after controlling for these factors, black women are still 1. 18 times more likely than white women to have prehypertension and over two times more likely to suffer hypertension. Indeed, my findings indicate that, of the factors included in all these models, only race, age, and BMI were significant predictors of blood pressure. Also, BMI was the only factor to explain some of the disparities between black and white women. These results are similar to other studies that have examined racial health disparities, suggesting that simply being a black woman in US society may be unhealthy. The health effects of racism, discrimination, and other sources of stress faced disproportionately by black women are not easily measured by social science research, which is possibly why racial disparities in blood pressure have yet to be explained. Future research should also explore possible epigenetic effects introduced by the health conditions experienced by previous generations, as well as the influence of prenatal and early life environments...|$|R
40|$|Executive summary Applied to {{different}} contexts, {{the approach to}} management and HRM practices initially operative, considered by some as the essential and universal key to organizational success, may face some contextual constraints and lead to conflicting results. Now, the local context brings to the subsidiary of international organizations little or no opportunities for the Headquarters. At the same time, the local context adds specific constraints. The consideration of these opportunities and constraints by the officials of the subsidiary is a real managerial challenge for them. This implies {{much more than a}} simple transfer of what has always worked well elsewhere. This questioning {{of the success of the}} universalist perspective pushes us to diagnose other possible ways to suggest for the approach to management and HRM practices that could better accommodate the local management. Our study is particularly concerned with international NGOs operating in sub-Saharan Africa and Burundi in particular. Our theoretical argument mobilizes universalist, culturalist and institutionalist approaches. Our study concerns only the subsidiaries of international NGOs and not their Headquarters. Note that throughout our work, the word "Siège" means the Headquarters and not the local management of the subsidiary. To mark this distinction, we opt to write it with a capital "S". Based on a contextualist analysis of five case studies of subsidiaries of international NGOs, we find that, upon their arrival or within the first years of implementation of the subsidiary, the leaders of these international subsidiaries almost always opt for a relational or even paternalistic model of management. Indeed, this model allows a gain in confidence and the establishement of strong relationships between the expats and the locals, and between volunteers and employees. The latter model also helps to react or deal with the complexity of an unstable local context (civil war, hatred and ethnic conflicts, distrust versus foreigners, oral tradition culture, lack of separation between work and family life, lack of some skills in the labor market and poverty of the population). Beyond the local constraints, pressure from the Headquarters, and the donors' requirements often result in the evolution of the business model implemented during the establishment period. But toward what model is moving the subsidiary, why, how and what are the implications for HRM practices? This is the series of questions we try to answer throughout this work. To get there, we pay special attention to the power games, the identification of the most influential players, the relationships, the mechanisms of prevention and / or of conflict management and the mobilization around the common goal. Our study shows that the managers of subsidiaries have two possible choices of a position: control logic or adaptation logic. The results of our research argue for the second option to be the most favorable to take into consideration the local context and to contribute to the emergence of consistent and very innovative HRM practices. Our work shows that the model based on the adaptation logic is more effective when the appropriation of the Headquarters rule by the members of the subsidiary is dominated by joint regulation mechanisms, and when the management of the subsidiary is polyphonic for what concerns managing the evolution of <b>contextual</b> factors. In <b>fact,</b> the latter mechanisms lead to the organization, in due time, to a genuine process of organizational change. The polyphonic style is generally characterized by flexibility, autonomy, accountability, collaboration, cooperation within teams and the search for compromise to satisfy the essential interests of the different stakeholders, including those at Headquarters. However, we note that some managers, guided by rational mimicry derived from the culture of their country of origin and their experience elsewhere, tried control-based management resulting in the domination of regulatory mechanisms either autonomous or controlled. Our observation is that the control-based management model leads the subsidiary in a logic of submission or circumvention of the rules and practices developed by the parent company. This management model quickly faces major resistance from certain groups of stakeholders who feel that their interests are threatened. For example, internal conflicts occur in these subsidiaries at the expense of the cooperation and the achievement of desired results. Highlighting the importance of the local context and the relationships Headquarters- subsidiaries together with the role of the management style in the evolution of HRM practices in the local management of international NGOs working in unstable and specific context (land and sector insufficiently studied up to now), this study brings a great contribution to international management and intercultural management theory in general and sub-Saharan Africa in particular...|$|R
