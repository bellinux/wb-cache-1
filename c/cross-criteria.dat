40|$|In {{the past}} decades, while many {{countries}} planned and undertook more and bigger infrastructure megaprojects, poor performance has marred their delivery, for example through cost overruns, delays, disputes, and shortfalls in expected benefits. It is therefore important {{to improve performance}} levels, especially in infrastructure megaprojects that can considerablely influence the economy, society and environment. Project evaluation is an effective tool in project performance management as it provides stakeholders with a management process through which they {{can learn from the}} past and perform better in the future. Most of the traditional evaluation approaches emphasize the three basic success criteria of time, budget and quality. However, with the increasing importance of sustainability criteria and concerns, as well as the growing imperatives for stakeholder engagement, it has already been suggested to reconsider and redefine value by also evaluating other factors, such as those related to the environment and society. Therefore, an integrated whole life cycle value (WLCV) evaluation framework is proposed in order to improve infrastructure megaproject WLCV performance. In this study, whole life cycle (WLC) evaluation has a two-fold meaning: (i) the evaluation is based on a set of value factors drawn from a WLCV system; and (ii) this evaluation is a systematic continuous process from the start {{to the end of the}} project. However, considering the unique characteristics of every project, a totally fixed or static structure and content framework is neither sufficient nor suitable for the various types of infrastructure megaprojects. The recommended solution is to develop a semi-flexible framework that enables a pre-determined step by step dynamic structure formulation and a flexible WLCV system. In order to measure project WLCV derived from stakeholders’ expectations, from more objective and persuasive perspectives, the relevant value objectives/criteria/indicators, their weightings and targets will be identified, integrated and developed through this WLCV system. <b>Cross-criteria</b> relationships which have not been addressed adequately before, will be dealt with by assigning appropriate weightings. It is also proposed to build a database to store completed project information including various stakeholders’ expectations expressed in the form of value objectives. In order to develop the above proposed framework, a basic literature review was conducted to reveal and analyze the significant evaluation problems, identify trends in stakeholder engagement and develop the concept as well as typical criteria and indicators of project WLCV. Meanwhile evaluation practices, stakeholder engagement in the process of evaluation and WLCV perspectives in the Hong Kong construction industry were examined through a first round of interviews and the first of two focus group meetings. The first focus group meeting, second round interviews and the second focus group meeting were conducted to improve the proposed framework by investigating the importance of assigning an appropriate weighting to each value objective and each group of stakeholders; elaborating the various value criteria to measure value objectives at appropriate points of a project WLC. The findings from literature reviews, interviews, focus group meetings and a case study were integrated and injected into developing the aforementioned framework for building and administering the evaluation of project WLCV in ways that could improve desired project WLC performance. The outputs of the current research are expected to assist clients of infrastructure megaprojects to build a sense of ownership among all the key stakeholders at the outset, and to help motivate all stakeholders to be more co-operative, with a view to jointly targeting and monitoring an agreed project WLCV, thereby helping to achieve better WLC performance on infrastructure megaprojects. The main contributions to knowledge from this research are in developing a comprehensive evaluation methodology which combines and refines relevant components from existing evaluation approaches as well as injects the WLCV concept and criteria into a more holistic approach that is expected to identify and address current inadequacies in infrastructure megaproject delivery. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
30|$|Many {{researchers}} (Li et al. 2017 a, b; Warpinski and Teufel 1987; Zhou et al. 2008) {{have found}} that the approach angle between the hydraulic fracture and the natural fracture had an important effect on the propagation path of hydraulic fractures. When the approach angle was less than 30 °, the hydraulic fracture would deflect along the natural fracture. When the approaching angle was between 30 ° and 60 °, the hydraulic fracture would be arrested and shear slip of the natural fractures would occur. When the approaching angle was more than 60 °, the hydraulic fracture could penetrate into the natural fractures. However, the experimental results in this study showed that the fracturing fluid could seep into natural weak planes in a variety of angles and mutually communicate with each other. Therefore, except for the angle of the natural weak plane, the natural fracture aperture and the cement strength also had significant impacts on the fracture morphology. During the process of hydraulic fracturing, the fracturing fluid might flow or seep along the natural fracture system in the coal, reducing the friction properties and the cement strength of the fracture surface. Based on the <b>cross-criterion</b> (Gu et al. 2012; Li et al. 2017 a, b), when the friction coefficient or cohesion of fracture surface decreases, the surface will undergo shear slip, and thus, the natural fracture system will open or be activated.|$|R
