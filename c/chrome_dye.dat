40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of low {{temperature}} plasma (LTP) treatment on the dyeing properties of wool were studied. Wool fibres were treated with oxygen plasma and three types of dyeing systems that are commonly used for wool dyeing, namely: (i) acid dye, (ii) <b>chrome</b> <b>dye</b> and (iii) reactive dye; {{were used in the}} dyeing process. For acid dyeing, the dyeing rate of LTP-treated wool fibre was greatly increased, but the final dyeinq exhaustion equilibrium did not show any significant change. For chrome dyeing, the dyeing rate of LTP-treated wool fibre was increased, but the final dyeing exhaustion equilibrium was increased only to a small extent. In addition, the rate of the afterchroming process was similar to the chrome dyeing process. In the case of reactive dyeing, the dyeing rate of LTP-treated wool fibre was greatly increased and also the final dyeing exhaustion equilibrium was increased significantly. As a result, it may be concluded that the LTP treatment could improve the dyeing behaviour of wool fibre under different dyeing systems. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Nine {{bacterial}} colonies {{were screened}} for the Cr(VI) removal efficiency {{and out of}} these three bacterial strains Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus sp. were isolated from soil and used to remove Cr(VI) from aqueous solution. The effect of time and concentrations on the removal rate of hexavalent chromium were studied using batch experiment. Maximum Cr (VI) removal was noted 75. 0 % by Bacillus sp. at 10 mg/l, 69. 70 % by Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 40 mg/l and 90. 88 % by Pseudomonas putida at 10 mg/l of synthetic solution, during 96 hours. Among these three bacteria, the maximum Cr(VI) removal was reported by Pseudomonas putida on lower concentration. On the basis of highest removal rate, Pseudomonas putida was selected and used for further chromium removal from samples. It {{was found to be}} removed the highest Cr(VI) by 82. 92 %, from effluent and 74. 41 % from soil during 96 hours. The present study depicts that bacteria removes chromium efficiently and this could be used for industrial waste management and other environmental contaminants.

40|$|Hydrolysis of {{aluminum}} (Al) in solution increases at pH >= 4 {{and with an}} Al concentration. Pectin, an important anionic polysaccharide of plant cell walls, adsorbs Al, but this phenomenon is poorly understood. This study showed that Ala hydrolysis results in binding of Al to pectin {{in excess of the}} stoichiometric equivalent, leading to oversaturation of the pectin with Al. However, the degree of pectin methyl-esterification did not affect the extent of Al hydrolysis. Binding of Al to purified cell wall material also resulted in Al hydrolysis in a pH- and soluble Al concentration-dependent manner, but the source of cell wall material had no effect at fixed pH. Staining of Al-treated pectin and cell wall material from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) with the Al-specific <b>dye,</b> <b>chrome</b> azurol S (CAS), resulted in the formation of a purple color, with the intensity related to the extent of Al hydrolysis...|$|R

40|$|Problem: Chrome platting factory had an {{accident}} that released hexavalent chromium into a nearby river. The river, which is used by several towns downstream {{as a source for}} drinking water, must be tested to assure the levels of Cr(VI) are safe for consumption. Samples will be taken every five miles until safe level is reached. Method: Ion Chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Cr(III) complexed with Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) to form a ligand that can be separated from Cr(VI). If Cl- and C are not separated out before ICP, they can form ClOH and ArC when reacted with the plasma. Sources of Hexavalent Chromium Hexavalent chromium can be found naturally in rocks, but is mostly produced from industrial procedures such as <b>chrome</b> plating, making <b>dyes,</b> leather tanning and for the production of stainless steel.

40|$|Human {{exposure}} to metals is common {{due to their}} wide use in industry, and environmental persistence. The heaviest metal exposures occurred in the workplace or in environmental settings {{in close proximity to}} industrial sources. Chromium is one of the heaviest metals. Although chromium relative atomic mass is 51. 996 g it may found in 0, + 2, + 3 and + 6 forms. Metal chromium (0) is used in steel production, whereas chromium (VI) and chromium (III) are used for <b>chrome</b> plating, <b>dyes</b> and pigments, leather tanning, and wood preserving. Divalent chromium (Cr 2 +) is a strong reductant. Chromium (VI) compounds are more toxic than chromium (III) compounds. Chromium (III) occurs naturally in the environment. The daily intake of chromium from food, air, and water is estimated, respectively, as 60, < 0. 2 - 0. 6, and < 4. 0 μg. Chromium enters the air, water and soil in the chromium(III) and chromium(VI) form through natural processes and human activities. A possible source of chromium {{exposure to}} the general public is waste dumps for chromate producing using local air or water pollution. Chromium compounds (chromates, dichromates and chromic acid) pose the most significant health hazards. Generally the health problems that are caused by chromium exposure are:- It can cause allergic reactions, such as skin rash; nose irritations and nosebleeds; Upset stomachs and ulcers; Respiratory problems such as respiratory tract irritant to the nose, throat and lungs; Weakened immune systems; Kidney and liver damage; Alteration of genetic material; Lung cancer and Death. The physiological effect of chromium exposure is not restricted to these effect only; but also, it affects other many physiological parameters including of:- Skin effects; Cardiovascular effects; Hematological effects; Reproductive and developmental effects; Gastrointestinal effects; Ocular effects; Neurological effects and so on...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was aimed at}} introducing natural dye extracted from the bark of Cassia Singueana plant for <b>dyeing</b> <b>chrome</b> tanned sheep skin crust leather. The colorant was extracted by aqueous extraction and its strength evaluated using UV-Visible spectroscopy. The extraction with the highest strength (3. 9 at λmax of 400 [*]nm) was obtained at temperature of 95 °C, concentration of 60 [*]g/l, and time of 60 minutes. The possibility of using aloe vera juice and mango bark extract as natural mordants for leather coloration was investigated. Dyeing was conducted with and without mordant using different combinations of temperature, time, pH, and concentration of mordants. All three mordanting techniques were evaluated. The color strength (K/S), CIE L⁎a⁎b⁎ values, and fastness properties (light, rubbing, and perspiration) of dyed leather samples were evaluated using appropriate instruments and according to international standards. Majority of samples exhibited that fastness result was {{in the range of}} good-excellent. Significantly better color fastness was obtained in case of leather samples premordanted with aloe vera. This study leads to the conclusion that dye extracted from bark of Cassia singueana can be used as colorant for tanned leather with the selected natural mordants...|$|R
40|$|Investigations on {{selected}} oxidation hair dyes - which are normally {{applied in the}} form of gels and pastes - have shown {{that it is possible to}} use these dyes on wool in commercial wool dyeing procedure. The precursors are applied at low low temperatures (e. g. 60 oC) and short treatment times (20 min). For the subsequent oxidation with H 2 O 2 temperatures of 40 oC are sufficient together with a development time of 40 min. Therefore, this colouring method offers a genuine low temperature colouring potential for wool, saving energy and time with a significant improvement of the wool quality in comparison to commercial wool dying at substantially higher temperatures (98 oC). At the same time the oxidation hair dyes offer a substitution potential for the heavymetalliferous <b>chrome</b> colouring <b>dyes,</b> since they are free from toxicological alarming heavy metals. With the system 2, 5 -diaminotoluene sulfate/ 2 -amino- 4 -hydroxyethyl aminoanisole sulfate a black coloured wool could nearly be realized. The use of 4 % oww precursor and a dye bath exhaustion up to 96 % results in a deep blue-black coloured wool. The small molecule size of the resulting chromophor together with its good water solubility turned out as a disadvantage for the fastness. With the system 1, 10 -bis-(2, 5 -diaminophenyl) - 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraoxadecane/ 1, 3 -bis-(2, 4 -di-aminophenoxy) propane a deep dark-blue black colour could be achieved. The structure of the high-molecular oligomers of this dye could not be determined. Investigations on the sorption of the precursors 1, 10 -bis-(2, 5 -diamino-phenyl) - 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraoxadecane and 1, 3 -bis-(2, 4 -di-aminophenoxy) propane on wool showed that the bath exhaustion of the precursor can be increased significantly from 60 to over 85 % by addition of surfactants such as sodiumdodecyl sulfate or dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid or by the use of plasma-treated wool. The alkaline fastness to perspiration with values of 3 - 4 and the (dry/wet) fastness to rubbing with values of 4 and 3 - 4 are satisfactory. The requirements of the Wollmark spezification for fabrics are almost met. The fastness to light with values of 4 fulfills the minimum requirements of the Wollmark federation for fabrics...|$|R
