5|$|The Financial Times {{poll was}} the result of over 10,000 {{respondents}} to nearly 23000 electronic questionnaires of alumni from 155 qualifying business schools.

The questionnaire used twenty criteria in three main areas. The poll actually presents all twenty criteria to the reader.

The occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy in people with Wilson's disease (hereditary copper accumulation) and mushroom poisoning indicates an urgent need for a liver transplant.|$|E
5|$|Many {{children}} with AS are initially misdiagnosed with {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD).

Emsley recognised four metalloids (germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium); James et al. listed twelve (Emsley's plus boron, carbon, silicon, selenium, bismuth, polonium, moscovium and livermorium).

5|$|As Ukrainian {{psychiatrist}} Ada Korotenko notes, {{the use of}} punitive psychiatry allowed {{of avoiding}} the judicial procedure during which the accused might declare the impossibility to speak publicly and the violation of their civil rights. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is insecure and can {{be based on a}} preconception. Moreover, while diagnosing mental illness, subjective fuzzy diagnostic <b>criteria</b> <b>are</b> involved as arguments. The lack of clear diagnostic criteria and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous and gifted citizens who disagree with authorities. At the same time, most psychiatrists incline to believe that such a misdiagnosis is less dangerous than not diagnosing mental illness.|$|E
