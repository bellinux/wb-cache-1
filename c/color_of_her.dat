This {{is followed by a}} nonlinear narrative that moves between the past and the present. A series of flashbacks reveal that only Yoki survived, coming under the care of Nui, who is a Mushishi (or Bugmaster)—an expert in Mushi, which are supernatural bug-like creatures that are invisible to most humans. She lives near a pond where {{there are two types of}} Mushi: a fish-like Ginko who swims in the darkness-like Tokoyami. Because Nui spent too long looking at the Ginko, one of her eyes and the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hair were altered by the shadow of Tokoyami. Eventually, Nui is swallowed by the Tokoyami. When Yoki tries to help her, he is also swallowed. Only by sacrificing one of his eyes and his memories is Yoki able to survive. He then renames himself Ginko because it is the only name he can remember.|$|E

[...] One of the only contemporary accounts by someone who actually saw her was that of James Wilkinson, who described her as [...] "a country girl of honest family in circumstances of mediocrity, without either beauty or accomplishments." [...] Later accounts embellished details; historian Richard Ketchum notes that the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hair has been described as everything from black to blonde to red; he also cites an 1840s examination of an alleged lock of her hair that described it as [...] "reddish".|$|E
500|$|When Barbie {{first came}} out, {{she was the}} subject of a lot of criticism, some of which that claimed Barbie was too mature-looking for children. Midge was the first same-size friend of Barbie ever sold, and was created to oppose these controversies aimed at Barbie. She had a fuller, gentler face mold that was less sexually intimidating, {{although}} her body proportions were the same as Barbie and they both stood at [...] tall. [...] This allowed the two dolls to be able to share clothes and accessories. Her head mold was stamped [...] "1958", the same as Barbie. When Midge arrived, the markings on the straight leg body mold they shared changed to include both her and Barbie. [...] Midge had shoulder-length hair that flipped at the ends. Buyers had an option of buying a doll with one of three different hair colors: red, blond, or brunette. Her face was usually brushed with freckles. The dolls that were sold without freckles had a longer hair style and are now hard to find. [...] Depending on the doll's hair color, the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> two-piece swimming suit varied. If Midge had red hair her swimsuit was yellow and orange, for blond hair it was in two shades of blue, and if she was brunette it was pink and red.

2500|$|He spent {{a seven-year}} period on a {{houseboat}} called Mona with Helen Torr, known as [...] "Reds" [...] for the fiery <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hair. Torr {{was also a}} painter. Although the psychological consequences benefited Dove’s art, his life with Torr was difficult. Florence Dove never cared about Dove's passion for art, and was more socially inclined. After 25 years of marriage, Dove left Florence. Florence would not grant him a divorce and flatly refused to let him see his son. When he departed, he left behind everything except his copies of Camera Work and Stieglitz’s letters. When Dove’s wife Florence died unexpectedly, he paid $250.00 for the funeral expenses and sent flowers, but {{did not go to}} the funeral in Geneva. Although distressed about her death, he was now able to see his son and marry Torr. For the first time in eight years, Dove met with his then nineteen-year-old son, Bill, who was also an artist. The two established a friendship and later in life his son became a help to Dove with creating a technique for silvering frames. Dove and Torr were not able to wed immediately as Torr had not divorced her first husband. Dove and Torr did eventually marry on April 1932 in the New York City Hall with a brief service and using a ten-cent store ring. Dove identified himself as a [...] "frame maker" [...] on his marriage registry. The 1933 Gallery 291 exhibition was the only time Stieglitz allowed Torr and Dove to exhibit together. [...] "Seven Americans" [...] brought Dove back into the coverage of major newspapers and art magazines, as well as back into the public eye. Dove's work influenced later abstract landscape painters, such as Hatton and O'Keeffe, in terms of having an [...] "unbridled love of pure, hot color." ...|$|E

She saw Mason's face darken again, and it seemed now it wore a look of disgust.|$|E

60|$|Laurie did {{not read}} all this while {{he watched her}} feed the peacocks, but he saw enough to satisfy and {{interest}} him, and carried away a pretty little picture of a bright-faced girl standing in the sunshine, which brought out the soft hue of her dress, the fresh <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cheeks, the golden gloss of her hair, and made her a prominent figure in the pleasant scene.|$|E
60|$|I {{decided to}} take Milly into my confidence, and finally on the {{strength}} of that I got to sleep.
