5|$|Educators face {{considerable}} challenges {{due to the}} nation's {{dispersed population}} and {{a certain degree of}} reluctance on the part of parents to send their <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>school.</b> Although attendance is compulsory, only 68 percent of boys attend primary school, {{and more than half of}} the population is illiterate. Higher education is provided at the University of N'Djamena. At 33 percent, Chad has one of the lowest literacy rates of Sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
5|$|One major {{effect of}} the {{recommendations}} is that, as of November 2008, it is mandatory that all vehicle operators who intend to use their vehicles to transport students between extracurricular activities be covered by a Third Party Liability and Accident Benefit policy. These policies {{must be in the}} amount of no less than CAD$1 million for vehicles with a capacity of fewer than 10 passengers, and no less than CAD$5 million for vehicles with a capacity of 10 or more. This also applies to parents driving others' <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> related extracurricular activities.|$|E
5|$|The {{stress of}} {{maintaining}} a career and a household {{can also lead to}} a loss of sleep. In traditional gender roles it is usually the mother who is the one to get the family going in the morning as she fixes breakfast and takes the <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> before she goes to her own job. At night the mother cooks and does various other activities around the house that cause her to be the last person to retire for the night as well. Although this is merely just a few gender roles that are not set in stone, they may hold to be true. It was found that working women sleep twenty-five minutes less a night due solely to their responsibility for domestic work. Applying this statistic in larger scale leads to the assumption that women on average lose up to thirteen hours of sleep per month due to domestic duties. It can be assumed that it is possible for an average woman to lose up to one hundred and fifty-six hours of sleep during a year because of domestic work and motherly duties.|$|E

50|$|Children {{with disabilities}} are less likely <b>to</b> attend <b>school</b> than non-disabled children.

25|$|Home {{education}} was outlawed in South Africa before 1994, and families were jailed for not sending their <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>school.</b> With {{the acceptance of}} the South African constitution in 1994, home {{education was}} legalised per implication. This was acknowledged with promulgation of the SA Schools Act of 1996 in which home education is accommodated in art. 51. Since home education was legalised, it has grown exponentially. According to the census count of 2011, there were about 57 000 home learners in the country, putting South Africa in the top five countries in terms of number of home learners.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, {{school fees}} for grades 1 to 10 were officially {{abolished}} but hidden costs remained. Other costs include loss of children's wages or unpaid labour for agriculture, tending livestock or housework. Whether children work depends on relative household wealth. Labour-intensive assets such as farms can hire labour if they generate sufficient profit but poorer households may need {{their children to}} help with these assets. This can relate to family size, with larger families sending their younger <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> because older children can help their parents. Attendance is reduced when children have to travel long distances to school since this increases personal risk and transport costs. There are also cultural attitudes against educating girls since education will only benefit her husband's household.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, {{the cases}} in which the Court had allowed a {{religious}} motivation to exempt a person from a neutral, generally applicable law involved the assertion of both the right of free exercise along with some other right. Thus, religious publishers are exempt from a law requiring them to obtain a license if that license may be denied to any publisher the government deems nonreligious. The government may not tax religious solicitors. The government may not require the Amish to send their <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> because their religion demands otherwise, and Amish parents, like all parents, have the right to direct the education of their children. Because Smith and Black were not asserting a hybrid right, they could not claim a religious exemption under the First Amendment from Oregon's ban on peyote.|$|E

25|$|The first snowmobiles were large, multipassenger {{vehicles}} {{designed to}} help people get around during the long winter months. Snowmobiles were used in rural Quebec to take <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>school,</b> carry freight, deliver mail, and as ambulances. His invention filled a very particular need {{in the region and}} soon business was booming. In1941 Armand opened a new factory in Valcourt. Then a major setback hit the growing business: the Second World War was well underway and the Canadian government issued wartime rationing regulations. Bombardier customers had to prove that snowmobiles were essential to their livelihood in order to buy one. To keep his business going, Armand shifted his focus and developed vehicles for the military. After the war, Bombardier experienced another setback in his snowmobile business. In1948, the Quebec government passed a law requiring all highways and local roads to be cleared of snow; the Bombardier company's sales fell by nearly half in one year. Armand Bombardier therefore decided to diversify his business, first by producing tracked snowplows sized specifically for use on municipal sidewalks (replacing horse-drawn vehicles), then by making all-terrain vehicles for the mining, oil, and forestry industries.|$|E
25|$|The Bahá'í-inspired Tahirih Justice Center and the Barli Vocational Institute for Rural Women in Indore in India are {{projects}} that have received particular attention. Layli Miller-Muro founded the Tahirih Justice Center in 1997 following a well-publicized asylum {{case in which}} she was involved as a student attorney. Miller-Muro later co-wrote a book with the client she had aided and used her portion of the proceeds for the initial funding of Tahirih. As of 2003, the organization had assisted more than 4,000 women and children fleeing {{from a wide variety of}} abuses. The Barli Vocational Institute for Rural Women was founded in 1985 in India and offers a six-month program for tribal women at its facilities in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Through June 1996, a total of 769 rural tribal women have been trained at the Institute; the women came from 119 villages, and after returning home to their cities or villages 45% of them established small businesses, 62% are functionally literate or semi-literate (which has motivated people to send their <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>school),</b> 42% have started growing vegetables, 97% are using safe drinking water, all the former trainees and many of their male relatives have given up drinking alcohol, and caste prejudices have been eliminated.|$|E
25|$|Ethiopia faces many historical, cultural, {{social and}} {{political}} obstacles that have restricted progress in education for many centuries. According to UNESCO reviews, most people in Ethiopia feel that work {{is more important than}} education, so they start {{at a very early age}} with little to no education. Children in rural areas are less likely to go to school than children in urban areas. Though gradually improving, most rural families cannot afford to send their <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> because parents believe that while their children are in school they cannot contribute to the household chores and income. Social awareness that education is important is something that Ethiopia lacks but has improved gradually. There is a need to change the importance of education in the country's social structure, and children should be encouraged and required to attend school and become educated. The society of Ethiopia expects teachers and parents to use corporal punishment to maintain order and discipline. Most believe that through punishing children for bad habits they in turn learn good ones. Also since the mid-1970s there was a drastic loss of professionals who left the country, mostly for economical reasons. Many educated Ethiopians sought higher salaries in foreign countries thus many of those who managed to finish higher education emigrated from Ethiopia creating an endless shortage of qualified professionals in every sector of the country. Now the custom of sending academics abroad with the risk of a brain drain is being replaced by expansion of masters and doctoral programs to up-grade academic staff. Instead, foreigners have been funding programs for leadership, management and pedagogic skills or sending staff to help strengthen teaching and management practices.|$|E
