5000|$|<b>Collar</b> <b>rot</b> is a symptomatically {{described}} {{disease that}} is usually caused by any one of various fungal and oomycete plant pathogens. It is present where the pathogen causes a lesion localized at or about the collet between the stem and the root. The lesions develop around the stem eventually forming a [...] "collar". Observationally, <b>collar</b> <b>rot</b> grades into [...] "basal stem rot", and with some pathogens is {{the first phase of}} [...] "basal stem rot" [...] often followed by [...] "root rot". <b>Collar</b> <b>rot</b> is most often observed in seedings grown in infected soil. The pathogens that cause <b>collar</b> <b>rot</b> may be species or genera specific. But generalist pathogens such as Athelia rolfsii (aka Sclerotium rolfsii) are known to attack over 200 different species. While bacteria caused <b>collar</b> <b>rot</b> is not common, trees infected with Fire blight (Erwinia amylovora) may develop <b>collar</b> <b>rot.</b> Non-parasitic <b>collar</b> <b>rot</b> may be caused by winter damage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Collar</b> <b>rot</b> that {{is caused}} by the oomycete Phytophthora is causally called Phytophthora <b>collar</b> <b>rot,</b> and is a common disease of fruit and nut trees, as well as other flowers and crops. Phytophthora species remain in the soil, as spores, and in {{infected}} plant tissue, as mycelia, so absent contol measures (sterilization, toxic applications) the disease continues so long as susceptible plants are grown in that soil.|$|E

30|$|P. nicotianae causes {{seedling}} blight {{of golden}} palm and also attacks California fan palm, causing trunk and <b>collar</b> <b>rots.</b> The disease appears to begin from wounds caused by leaf removal {{at or near}} the soil line. Although this disease can be reproduced by inoculations of the lower trunk, the bud and the entire stem are eventually rotted on some plants. Thus, P. nicotianae should also be considered as a possible cause of bud rots.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the common}} name of Phytophthora palmivora is bud rot of palms, it affects many {{tropical}} plants {{and has a}} moderately broad host range. P. palmivora is well studied in coconuts and papaya trees, however there are multiple hosts that are less commonly studied. One common symptom of P. palmivora is fruit rots which are found in papaya, citrus, coconuts, durian, and cacao. Root rots are another symptom of P. palmivora and {{can be seen in}} Red Maples, citrus, papaya, mango, durian, and black pepper. Another symptom is the presence of cankers which are found in Red Maple, papaya, rubber, mangoes, and cacao. Bud rots can also be seen in papaya and coconuts infected with P. Palmivora. Bud rots are also found in Palmyra Palms and coconut palms. <b>Collar</b> <b>rots</b> are found on citrus, mango, and black pepper infected with P. Palmivora. The signs of P. palmivora are microscopic and can be differentiated from other oomycetes by the presence of oval shaped papillate sporangia with short pedicles and spherical oogonia with narrow stalks (Widmer, 2014).|$|R

40|$|Since 2004, {{containerized}} nursery {{stocks of}} rosemary and lavender {{have been affected}} by a <b>collar</b> and root <b>rot</b> problem in Valencia (Spain). Nurseries had about 70 % of affected plants showing lack of vigour, wilt and dieback symptoms. Phytophthora sp. was isolated con-sistently from symptomatic plants, and eighteen isolates were obtained, ten from lavender and eight from rose-mary. The species was identified as P. nicotianae based on morphological and physiological features. Some iso-lates were identified as atypical representatives of P. nicotianae. Identification of the isolates was confirmed by the sequence of the nuclear ribosomal internal tran-scribed spacer (ITS) region.

40|$|Chemical control trials against Phytophthora capsici (Leon) on pepper cultivations in Morocco. Pepper {{protection}} trials against <b>collar</b> {{and root}} <b>rot</b> have been undertaken under laboratory and culture conditions using Aliette (80 % of phosethylaluminium) and Ridomil M 58 (10 % of metalaxyl associated to 48 % of maneb). It {{has been proved}} that, contrary to Ridomil M 58, Aliette does not protect the hostplant when the Phytophthora capsici (Leon) zoospores are used as inoculum. But both fongicides are active when inoculating with a mycelian suspension. Trials undertaken under plastic glasshouses confirmed the laboratory results both with an artificial inoculation and with a natural one on contaminated soil. Only Ridomil M 58 provides satisfactory protection during the first weeks after the treatment. When disease propagation conditions are particularly favorable (permanent presence of an active inoculum source), the protection given by repeated Ridomil M 58 applications gradually disappears after a few weeks...|$|R
40|$|A {{recent study}} to {{determine}} the cause of <b>collar</b> and root <b>rot</b> disease outbreaks of cold tolerant Eucalyptus species in South Africa resulted in the isolation of two putative new Phytophthora species. Based on phylogenetic comparisons using the ITS and β-tubulin gene regions, these species were shown to be distinct from known species. These differences were also supported by robust morphological characteristics. The names, Phytophthora frigida sp. nov. and Phytophthora alticola sp. nov. are thus provided for these taxa, which are phylogenetically closely related to species within the ITS clade 2 (P. citricola, P. tropicali and P. multivesiculata) and 4 (P. arecae and P. megakarya), respectively. Phytophthora frigida is heterothallic, and produces stellate to rosaceous growth patterns on growth medium, corraloid hyphae, sporangia with a variety of distorted shapes and has the ability to grow at low temperatures. Phytophthora alticola is homothallic and has a slower growth rate in culture. Both P. frigida and P. alticola are pathogenic to Eucalyptus dunnii. In pathogenicity tests, they were, however, less pathogenic than P. cinnamomi, which is a well-known pathogen of Eucalyptus in South Africa...|$|R
50|$|Malling 7 {{rootstock}} {{is slightly}} bigger than an M26 rootstock, and also requires staking {{in the first}} several years to establish a centre leader. This rootstock is moderately susceptible to blight and <b>collar</b> <b>rot.</b> The fruit size that M7 produces is good but not as large as an M26, or M9 rootstock. This root is highly susceptible to suckering and leaning over in its later years of life, which is very annoying and causes issues for the producer.|$|E
50|$|The {{cultivation}} of Verticordia in the Eastern states of Australia has proved difficult; {{many of the}} species are intolerant of the wet summers of those regions, {{especially with regard to}} root or <b>collar</b> <b>rot</b> and moulds and mildew. The successes achieved by some growers have been through the use of bell jars, attention to soil types and potting mixes, and, experimentally, the use of grafting onto plants of related genera, such as Darwinia citriodora and Geraldton Wax, Chamelaucium uncinatum.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of apples, in which {{research}} is being carried out {{in order to develop}} resistance to diseases such as apple scab (Venturia inaequalis), powdery mildew (Podosphaera leucotricha), orchard fireblight (Erwinia amylovora), woolly apple aphid (Eriosoma lanigerum) and <b>collar</b> <b>rot</b> (Phytophthora cactorum), the main sources of resistant material used in breeding programmes such as those being run by East Malling Research Station in England or Hortresearch in New Zealand are major gene resistances derived from crab-apples. The Vf gene for black spot resistance is derived from the ornamental crab-apple species Malus floribunda. Most black spot resistant cultivars developed around the world carry this gene, but there are some selections that carry the Vr (from M. pumila) or Vm (from M. micromalus) gene. Major gene resistances to powdery mildew are derived from M. robusta (Pl1) and M. zumi (Pl2), and the apple cultivar Northern Spy has a long-standing reputation for its major gene resistance to woolly apple aphid. Since early this century this resistance has been used to develop woolly aphid resistant rootstocks such as MM.106 and M.793. Much later it was shown that the cultivar was also very resistant to <b>collar</b> <b>rot</b> and a useful breeding parent for this resistance.|$|E
50|$|On older trees, P. cactorum {{causes the}} {{formation}} of sap exuding dark colored cankers on the trunks of trees, as well as leaf size and number reduction, chlorosis, and dieback of branches. The diagnosis of a P. cactorum infection of trees, {{is based on the}} identification of symptoms, in particular the oozing cankers, and confirmation of symptoms in a diagnosis lab or utilization of a field ELISA detection kit. Phytophthora cactorum can be a major problem in apple orchards, as it can cause crown, <b>collar,</b> and root <b>rots</b> in apple trees. When infecting apple trees, the organism can attack through wounds either above or below the soil line, impairing phloem and root function, and causing stunting, foliar disorders, and death after several years. Furthermore, because the pathogen causes damage to the phloem of the tree, one diagnostic method is to check for necrotic phloem tissue {{at the base of the}} tree which will be orange to red-brown in the early stages and dark brown in the later stages of infection.|$|R
40|$|Jatropha curcas L. {{seed oil}} {{is proven to}} be toxic to many microorganisms, insects and animals. Despite its toxicity, Jatropha is not pest and disease resistant. The {{following}} major pests and diseases affecting Jatropha in the lower valley of the Senegal river have been identified: the leaf miner Stomphastis thraustica (Meyrick, 1908) (Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae), the leaf and stem miner Pempelia morosalis (Saalmuller, 1880) (Lepidoptera, Pyralidae) and the shield-backed bug Calidea panaethiopica (Kirkaldy, 1909) (Heteroptera, Scutelleridae), which can cause flower and fruit abortion. Damage from these pests was particularly great during the second year after the plantations were set up (2009) and before later receding. Nevertheless, the worst attacks were caused by a vascular disease transmitted through the soil, which killed 65 % of the plants in four years. It is mainly characterised by <b>collar</b> and root <b>rot,</b> which causes foliage to yellow and wilt, before the plant eventually dies. These threats should increase if larger areas are planted with Jatropha. Considering {{the scale of the}} damage caused by these attacks in Bokhol, the development of an integrated pest management programme adapted to the local context should be considered.

50|$|<b>Collar</b> <b>rot</b> {{disease is}} caused from the fungus Fusarium solani. It is {{characterized}} by necrotic lesions at the collar region, browning of the stem at soil level, and dark discoloration of the stem. The rotting stem interferes with food and water transport within the plant, leading to withering of the plant until death. Infection occurs mostly through contaminated soil and infected plants which cause the plants to survive {{for only a few}} weeks. There are no chemical controls. Management includes planting seedlings in unaffected areas and using clean tools.|$|E
5000|$|Phytophthora pseudosyringae is a [...] {{homothallic}} soil-borne {{plant pathogen}} causing root and <b>collar</b> <b>rot</b> of deciduous tree species in Europe. It {{is associated with}} necrotic fine roots and stem necroses of Fagus sylvatica and Alnus glutinosa, and isolates are moderately aggressive to fine roots of oaks and beech (Nothofagus), highly aggressive to holly leaves and apple fruits, and slightly pathogenic to alder bark.It belongs to the class of oomycetes and {{is often described as}} a ‘fungal-like’ organism since they form a heterotrophic mycelium as the ‘true fungi’, but in contrast, their cell wall lacks chitin and is composed only of cellulose and glucans.|$|E
5000|$|M.26: Dwarfing - Similar to M9 in effect, {{although}} {{somewhat more}} vigorous and generally stronger, {{with a higher}} expected eventual yield of 65 - 75 lb and height of 8 to 10 ft. A good choice where soil quality is average and compact growth is required. Comes into fruit after 3 to 4 years, reaching full cropping capacity after 5 to 6 years. Staking is needed {{for the first four}} or five years of its life.It is susceptible to <b>collar</b> <b>rot</b> and fire blight and should not be planted in a wet site. Certain varieties when grafted onto this rootstock may exhibit signs of graft union incompatibility, i.e., the union breaks.|$|E
5000|$|MM.106: Semi-dwarfing — Sometimes {{referred}} to as semi-vigorous, {{this is the most}} widely used of rootstocks. It is probably the best choice for the average garden under average conditions, being tolerant {{of a wide range of}} soils, and producing a tree with an eventual size of 12 to 18 ft. Trees on this stock begin producing fruit within three to four years, and yield 90 to 110 lb after some seven or eight years. MM106 is very suitable for use with weaker varieties that would produce undersized bushes with more dwarfing rootstocks. Can be trained as a half standard tree, but is rather too vigorous for cordons unless the soil is poor. Requires staking for the first four or five years or so of its life. Trees on MM.106 are highly susceptible to <b>collar</b> <b>rot</b> especially when planted in soils that remain wet(poor percolation).|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, kauri dieback was {{discovered}} on Great Barrier Island. The disease, known as kauri <b>collar</b> <b>rot,</b> has begun spreading through kauri forests on the mainland. The disease causes yellowing leaves, thinning canopy, dead branches, lesions that bleed resin and tree death. It {{is caused by}} Phytophthora agathidicida which {{was identified as a}} new species in April 2008. Its closest known relative is Phytophthora katsurae. The phytophthora is believed to be spread on people's shoes or by mammals, particularly feral pigs. A collaborative response team has been formed to work on the disease. The team includes MAF Biosecurity, the Conservation Department, Auckland and Northland regional councils, Waikato Regional Council, and Bay of Plenty Regional Council. The team is charged with assessing the risk, determining methods and their feasibility to limit the spread, collecting more information (e.g. how widespread), and ensuring a coordinated response. The Department of Conservation has issued guidelines {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease, including keeping to defined tracks, cleaning footwear before and after entering kauri forest areas, and staying away from kauri roots.|$|E
50|$|On tomato, foliar {{symptoms}} of A. solani generally {{occur on the}} oldest leaves and start as small lesions that are brown to black in color. These leaf spots resemble concentric rings - a distinguishing characteristic of the pathogen - and measure up to 1.3 cm (0.51 inches) in diameter. Both {{the area around the}} leaf spot and the entire leaf may become yellow or chlorotic. Under favorable conditions (e.g., warm weather with short or abundant dews), significant defoliation of lower leaves may occur, leading to sunscald of the fruit. As the disease progresses, symptoms may migrate to the plant stem and fruit. Stem lesions are dark, slightly sunken and concentric in shape. Basal girdling and death of seedlings may occur, a symptom known as <b>collar</b> <b>rot.</b> In fruit, A. solani invades at the point of attachment to the stem as well as through growth cracks and wounds made by insects, infecting large areas of the fruit Fruit spots are similar in appearance to those on leaves - brown with dark concentric circles. Mature lesions are typically covered by a black, velvety mass of fungal spores that may be visible under proper light conditions.|$|E
50|$|Rhizoctonia solani (teleomorph: Thanatephorus cucumeris) is a plant {{pathogenic}} fungus {{with a wide}} {{host range}} and worldwide distribution. It was discovered more than 100 years ago. R. solani frequently exists as thread-like growth on plants or in culture, and is considered a soil-borne pathogen. R. solani is best known to cause various plant diseases such as <b>collar</b> <b>rot,</b> root rot, damping off, and wire stem. R. solani attacks its hosts {{when they are in}} their early stages of development, such as seeds and seedlings, which are typically found in the soil. The pathogen is known to cause serious plant losses by attacking primarily the roots and lower stems of plants. Although it has a wide range of hosts, its main targets are herbaceous plants. R. solani would be considered a basidiomycete fungus if the teleomorph stage were more abundant. The pathogen is not currently known to produce any asexual spores (conidia), though it is considered to have an asexual lifecycle. Occasionally, sexual spores (basidiospores) are produced on infected plants. The disease cycle of R. solani is important in management and control of the pathogen.|$|E
50|$|The {{pathogen}} M. phaseolina {{affects the}} fibrovascular {{system of the}} roots and basal internodes of its host, impeding the transport of water and nutrients to the upper parts of the plant. As a result, progressive wilting, premature dying, loss of vigor, and reduced yield are characteristic symptoms of M. phaseolina infection. The fungus also causes many diseases like damping off, seedling blight, <b>collar</b> <b>rot,</b> stem rot, charcoal rot, basal stem rot, and root rot. Although brown lesions may form on the hypocotyls or emerging seedlings, many symptoms occur during or after flowering, including grey discoloration of the stem and taproots, shredding of plant tissue in the stem and top of the taproot, and hollowing of the stem. Small black dots may form beneath the epidermis of the lower stem and in the taproot, giving the stems and roots a charcoal-sprinkled appearance. When the epidermis is removed, small and black microsclerotia (a sign of the disease) may be so numerous that they give a greyish-black tint to the plant tissue. In addition, reddish-brown discoloration and black streaks can form in the pith and vascular tissues of the root and stem.|$|E
