5|$|Akane Tsunemori {{was created}} by the Production I.G staff to be the most {{relatable}} character in the series.

Hanazawa said one of the focal points of the series after the third episode was the changes Akane would undergo; she would be influenced by many unfamiliar, traumatic experience she must endure as part of her policing role.|$|E
5|$|Darius's European {{expedition}} was a {{major event}} in his reign, which began with the invasion of Thrace.

Jean d'Anjou and Piccinino were stationed in Lucera, however, eight miles from Troia. Knowing that battle would <b>come</b> <b>between</b> Troia and Lucera, Skanderbeg set out by night to capture Seggiano, a mountain lying between the two cities, where he stationed some of his men to protect it. Thence, his men could find refuge in case of defeat. Piccinino had the same objective in mind and set out to capture the mountain, but instead met Skanderbeg's men. He thus kept his men in order for the coming battle. The next day, the two armies met. The battle lasted until dusk, but Jean's men suffered a serious defeat and he was forced to flee. Piccinino then retreated from his campaigns. He went northwards where he joined Sigismondo Malatesta and 200 of his men to launch assaults on the papal state.|$|E

Males use their antlers when sparring against each other, and reindeer may use them {{as a last resort}} to defend themselves and their young against predators such as wolves, although wolves present no threat in southwestern Greenland.
