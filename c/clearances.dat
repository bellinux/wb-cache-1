Because of the sensitive nature of information at stake in the trial, two separate hearings were conducted, one in public, and the other in camera. The defendants, Morland and the editors of The Progressive, would not accept security <b>clearances,</b> which would put restraints on their free speech, and so were not present at the in camera hearings.

5|$|The initial {{plan was}} to {{evacuate}} via Mogadishu International Airport. Soon after the evacuation request, the United States Air Force deployed C-130 transport planes and an AC-130, for gunfire support, to Nairobi, Kenya, awaiting <b>clearances</b> to enter Somalia {{and the ability to}} safely transfer evacuees from the embassy to the airport. However, the US and other foreign embassies were unable to contact anyone within the government to obtain <b>clearances.</b> It also became apparent that the rebels had an ineffective command-and-control structure, making it impossible to negotiate any ceasefire or guarantee of safe passage. Likewise, government troops faced a command-and-control problem; reports indicated that army units were separating along clan lines, in some cases soldiers shot officers of a different clan when given orders they disagreed with. Thus, it became clear that safe passage to the airport would not be possible. Several other nations also had aircraft mobilized to reach Mogadishu, but faced the same problems of landing and transit of evacuees to the airport.|$|E

50|$|The {{total body}} <b>clearance</b> will {{be equal to}} the renal <b>clearance</b> + hepatic <b>clearance</b> + lung <b>clearance.</b> Although for many drugs the <b>clearance</b> is simply {{considered}} as the renal excretion ability, that is, {{the rate at which}} waste substances are cleared from the blood by the kidney. In these cases <b>clearance</b> is almost synonymous with renal <b>clearance</b> or renal plasma <b>clearance.</b> Each substance has a specific <b>clearance</b> that depends on its filtration characteristics. <b>Clearance</b> is a function of glomerular filtration, secretion from the peritubular capillaries to the nephron, and re-absorption from the nephron back to the peritubular capillaries. <b>Clearance</b> is variable in zero-order kinetics because a constant amount of the drug is eliminated per unit time, but it is constant in first-order kinetics, because the amount of drug eliminated per unit time changes with the concentration of drug in the blood. The concept of <b>clearance</b> was described by Thomas Addis, a graduate of the University of Edinburgh Medical School.|$|R

5|$|One {{result of}} these changes were the Highland <b>Clearances,</b> by which much of the {{population}} of the Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The <b>clearances</b> followed patterns of agricultural change throughout the UK, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. The result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, or further afield to England, Canada, America or Australia. Many that remained were now crofters, living on very small rented farms with indefinite tenure used to raise various crops and animals. For these families kelping, fishing, spinning of linen and military service became important sources of additional revenue. Scotland suffered its last major subsistence crisis, when the potato blight that caused the Irish potato famine reached the Highlands in 1846. Some 150,000 people whose food supply was mainly potatoes faced disaster. They were rescued by an effective emergency relief system that stands in contrast to the failures of relief in Ireland, but the danger of starvation remained into the 1850s.|$|E

5|$|The deposed Jacobite Stuart claimants had {{remained}} {{popular in the}} Highlands and north-east, particularly amongst non-Presbyterians, including Roman Catholics and Episcopalian Protestants. However, two major Jacobite Risings launched in 1715 and 1745 failed to remove the House of Hanover from the British throne. The threat of the Jacobite movement to the United Kingdom and its monarchs effectively ended at the Battle of Culloden, Great Britain's last pitched battle.

5|$|This period saw {{a process}} of {{rehabilitation}} for Highland culture. In the 1820s, {{as part of the}} Romantic revival, tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe, prompted by the popularity of Macpherson's Ossian cycle and then Walter Scott's Waverley novels. However, the Highlands remained very poor and traditional. The desire to improve agriculture and profits led to the Highland <b>Clearances,</b> in which much {{of the population of the}} Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The <b>clearances</b> followed patterns of agricultural change throughout Britain, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. One result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, or further afield to England, Canada, America or Australia. The population of Scotland grew steadily in the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901. Even with the development of industry there were not enough good jobs. As a result, during the period 1841–1931, about 2 million Scots migrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England.|$|E

5|$|An {{amendment}} to the Government of India's Environment Impact Assessment Notification of 1994 was made in 2004, which required that environmental clearance be granted to any parcel of land that falls under the Yamuna floodplain before beginning any construction activities. Since Akshardham commenced construction activities in 2000, prior to the enactment of this amendment, it {{did not apply to}} Akshardham. However certain NGOs and activists felt that the temple was constructed without obtaining the necessary environmental <b>clearances.</b> On January 2005, the U.P. Employees Federation presented their case before the Supreme Court of India that the temple had not obtained necessary environmental <b>clearances</b> {{and that it would be}} harmful to the environment. After hearing the case, the Supreme Court observed that in the construction of Akshardham, all the Land Use Plans had been adhered to and clearance of expert bodies like the Central Water Commission and the National Environment Engineering Research Institute has been obtained. Thus, the Supreme Court ruled that the Akshardham construction was lawful and did not violate environmental norms. Despite this ruling, some activists and politicians continued to assert that the Akshardham construction was illegal and posed a threat to the Yamuna River floodplains. In a 2009 ruling on a related issue, the Supreme Court further clarified that it rejected as false the assertions that Akshardham did not have environmental permissions and was harmful to the Yamuna riverbed. It reiterated its earlier 2005 Ruling that Akshardham had received all necessary environmental permissions from Central Water Commission and NEERI, which is an autonomous body, and that the Akshardham site was not located on the Yamuna “riverbed” or “floodplain”, but 1700 meters away from the Yamuna River bank.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Oesophageal <b>clearance</b> of {{acid reflux}} {{consists}} of an initial volume <b>clearance</b> followed by neutralisation of the acidified mucosa by swallowed saliva (chemical <b>clearance).</b> Ineffective oesophageal motility (IOM), a frequent finding in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), has been claimed to underlie prolonged acid <b>clearance</b> by affecting oesophageal emptying and saliva transport. Intraluminal impedance allows non-radiological monitoring of movement of oesophageal liquids. AIMS: To evaluate the relevance of IOM during oesophageal volume and chemical <b>clearance</b> using combined pH impedance measurements. SUBJECTS: Impedance was validated with fluoroscopy to study volume <b>clearance</b> in three healthy subjects. Acid <b>clearance</b> tests were performed in 10 healthy subjects in the upright and supine positions, before and after oesophageal peristaltic disruption with sildenafil 50 mg. METHODS: After instillation of an acid bolus, simultaneous manometry, pH, and impedance were used to study oesophageal motility, chemical <b>clearance,</b> and volume <b>clearance,</b> respectively. RESULTS: Impedance allowed assessment of volume <b>clearance</b> accurately, showing a strong correlation with fluoroscopy (r(2) = 0. 89). Sildenafil provoked a graded impairment in oesophageal motility in healthy subjects without affecting saliva secretion. In the upright position, volume <b>clearance</b> was slightly prolonged only with severe IOM (> 80 % abnormal peristaltic sequences). In the supine position, severe IOM significantly prolonged chemical and volume <b>clearance.</b> Moderate IOM (30 - 80 % abnormal peristalsis) had no effect. With normal peristalsis and moderate IOM, <b>clearance</b> times were similar in the upright and supine positions. Severe IOM however had {{a greater impact on}} <b>clearance</b> in the supine than in the upright position. CONCLUSION: Ineffective oesophageal motility has little effect on oesophageal <b>clearance</b> during upright acid reflux. With supine reflux, only severe IOM is associated with prolonged oesophageal <b>clearance.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
