5|$|Giraffes {{have high}} adult {{survival}} probability, and an unusually long lifespan {{compared to other}} ruminants, up to 25 years in the wild. Because of their size, eyesight and powerful kicks, adult giraffes are usually not subject to predation, aside from lions. Giraffes {{are the most common}} prey for the big cats in Kruger National Park. Nile crocodiles can also be a threat to giraffes when they bend down to drink. <b>Calves</b> are much more vulnerable than adults, and are additionally preyed on by leopards, spotted hyenas and wild dogs. A quarter to a half of giraffe <b>calves</b> reach adulthood. Calf survival varies according to the season of birth, with <b>calves</b> born during the dry season having higher survival rates. The local, seasonal presence of large herds of migratory wildebeests and zebras reduces predation pressure on giraffe <b>calves</b> and increases their survival probability.|$|E
5|$|Males, {{females and}} juveniles each form {{separate}} social groups. The male groups are the smallest; the members stay together {{and search for}} food or water sources. The female group is much larger and covers greater areas. They travel the grassy plains in wet periods and prefer bushy areas in dry periods. Females have a complex linear hierarchy. The nursery and juvenile group is naturally formed when females give birth to <b>calves.</b> After about 24 hours of the delivery, the mother and calf join this group. The <b>calves</b> start befriending each other and stay back in the nursery group while the mother returns to the female group. The <b>calves</b> leave the nursery group when they {{are at least two}} years old and join a male or female group.|$|E
5|$|Mother hippos {{are very}} {{protective}} {{of their young}} and may keep others at a distance. However, <b>calves</b> are occasionally left in nurseries which are guarded by {{one or a few}} adults. <b>Calves</b> in nurseries engage in playfights. Weaning starts between six and eight months after birth, and most <b>calves</b> are fully weaned after a year. Like many other large mammals, hippos are described as K-strategists, in this case typically producing just one large, well-developed infant every couple of years (rather than many small, poorly developed young several times per year as is common among small mammals such as rodents).|$|E

The simple <b>calving</b> laws currently used in ice sheet models do not adequately reflect the complexity and diversity of <b>calving</b> processes. To be effective, <b>calving</b> laws must be grounded in a sound understanding of how <b>calving</b> actually works. Here, we develop a new strategy for formulating <b>calving</b> laws, using a) the Helsinki Discrete Element Model (HiDEM) to explicitly model fracture and <b>calving</b> processes, and b) the continuum model Elmer/Ice to identify critical stress states associated with HiDEM <b>calving</b> events. A range of observed <b>calving</b> processes emerges spontaneously from HiDEM in response to variations in ice-front buoyancy and the size of subaqueous undercuts. <b>Calving</b> driven by buoyancy and melt undercutting is under-predicted by existing <b>calving</b> laws, but we show that the location and magnitude of HiDEM <b>calving</b> events can be predicted in Elmer/Ice from characteristic stress patterns. Our results open the way to developing <b>calving</b> laws that properly reflect the diversity of <b>calving</b> processes, and provide a framework for a unified theory of the <b>calving</b> process continuum.

MoserThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the heritability of <b>calving</b> rate and age at first <b>calving</b> in Hereford heifers, and evaluate whether age at <b>calving</b> would add accuracy to a genetic evaluation of <b>calving</b> rate. Pedigree and performance data on Hereford heifers born between 2001 and 2007 was provided by the American Hereford Association. After editing to exclude animals that did not fit inclusion criteria, the evaluated dataset contained 94, 709 heifers with <b>calving</b> status information. Data were analyzed using single and two-trait animal models to obtain heritability estimates, and genetic correlation between <b>calving</b> rate and age at first <b>calving</b> was determined using MTDFREML. Contemporary groups for <b>calving</b> traits were defined as heifers that were in the same yearling weight contemporary group, and remained in the ownership of the same breeder through the age that they would be expected to <b>calve.</b> Estimates of heritability for <b>calving</b> rate and age at first <b>calving</b> from single-trait models were 0. 25, and 0. 12, respectively. Genetic correlation between <b>calving</b> rate and age at first <b>calving</b> was - 0. 01. <b>Calving</b> rate is moderately heritable in Hereford heifers, and can be used in genetic evaluation of sires to improve the trait through selection.

40|$|Developing {{replacement}} heifers is {{the most}} expensive enterprise in the cow-calf operation. You can increase returns to heifer development if the heifers <b>calve</b> at 24 months of age and <b>calve</b> early in the <b>calving</b> season.

5|$|A fold of semi-wild Highland cattle was studied, over {{a period}} of 4 years. It was found that the cattle have a clear {{structure}} and hierarchy of dominance, which reduced aggression. Social standing depended on age and sex, with older cattle being dominant to <b>calves</b> and younger ones and males dominant to females. Young bulls would dominate adult cows when they reached around 2 years of age. <b>Calves</b> from the top ranking cow were given higher social status, despite minimal intervention from their mother.

5|$|As {{in other}} ruminants, the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although {{generally}} similar to adults, newborn <b>calves</b> have false eyelashes, a long dorsal mane and long white hairs in the stripes.

The growth rate of <b>calves</b> is appreciably high in {{the first few months of}} birth, after which it gradually declines. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months. Horn development in males takes one year after birth. The okapi's average lifespan is 20 to 30 years.|$|E

40|$|Data on lactational and {{reproductive}} performances for 1993 and 1994 of dairy cows which <b>calved</b> in autumn or in spring on eight commercial winter milk supply farms around Palmerston North were collected. The eight commercial winter milk supply herds had a <b>calving</b> spread condensed into autumn and spring seasons. There were 7689 calvings recorded involving 3787 cows. The lactational parameters measured were yields of milk fat and milk protein per lactation, and days in milk (DIM) per cow. The mean milk fat production for the autumn <b>calved</b> cows was 206 kg/cow and 166 kg milk protein/cow (372 kg milk solids) per lactation while the spring <b>calved</b> cows produced 199 kg milk fat/cow and 160 kg milk protein/cow (359 kg milk solids) per lactation. The mean lactation length (DIM) for the autumn <b>calved</b> cows was 282 days, while the spring <b>calved</b> cows {{had a mean}} lactation length of 258 days (P< 0. 05). The mean daily milk fat yield averaged across the days in milk was 0. 73 kg per cow for the autumn <b>calved</b> cows while the spring <b>calved</b> cows had a mean daily milk fat yield of 0. 77 kg/cow (P< 0. 05). The mean values of milk production {{in the second and}} third months of lactation were 18 litres per day and 17 litres per day for the autumn <b>calved</b> cows while spring <b>calved</b> cows produced 22 litres per day during the second month of lactation and 19 litres per day during the third month of lactation respectively. The reproductive parameters measured were <b>calving</b> interval (CI), 4 weeks submission rates (SR), 42 day non-return rates (NNR), services per conception, 4 week <b>calving</b> rates and empty rates. The autumn <b>calved</b> cows had a longer CI than the spring <b>calved</b> cows; 390 days vs 372 days (P< 0. 05). The autumn <b>calved</b> cows had a lower average 4 weeks SR than the spring <b>calved</b> cows; 71 % vs 81 % (P< 0. 05). The autumn <b>calved</b> cows had a lower average 42 day NNR (conception rate) than the spring <b>calved</b> cows; 55 % vs 64 % (P< 0. 05). The autumn <b>calved</b> cows had a higher average of services per conception than the spring <b>calved</b> cows; 1. 9 vs 1. 6 (P< 0. 05). The autumn <b>calved</b> cows had a lower 4 week <b>calving</b> rate than the spring <b>calved</b> cows; 41 % vs 54 % (P< 0. 05). The autumn <b>calved</b> cows had a higher average empty rate than the spring <b>calved</b> cows; 12 % vs 10 % (P< 0. 05). These results show that cows which <b>calved</b> in autumn actually produced larger yields of milk fat and milk protein per lactation than those which <b>calved</b> in spring. However, these higher yields were achieved in longer lactations, and the autumn cows produced lower average daily yields than the spring <b>calved</b> cows. The lower daily yields during the second and third months of lactation by the autumn cows, indicated that these cows were on a lower level of feeding at this stage than the spring <b>calved</b> cows. The autumn <b>calved</b> cows had lower values for all aspects of reproductive performance than the spring <b>calved</b> cows. This difference is probably due to, at least partly, to the lower level of feeding in early lactation. These herds are relatively high producing, and therefore it can be deduced that they are generally well managed. Nevertheless the autumn <b>calved</b> cows were fed less well in early lactation than the spring <b>calved</b> cows, causing slightly poorer performances...|$|R
