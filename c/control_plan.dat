40|$|Abstract — Aims: To {{understand}} how US cancer <b>control</b> <b>plans</b> address alcohol use, an important but frequently overlooked cancer risk factor, {{and how many}} US adults are at risk. Methods:We reviewed alcohol control efforts in 69 comprehensive cancer <b>control</b> <b>plans</b> in US states, tribes and jurisdictions. Using the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we assessed the prevalence of current alcohol use among US adults {{and the proportion of}} these drinkers who exceeded guidelines for moderate drinking. Results:Most com-prehensive cancer <b>control</b> <b>plans</b> acknowledged alcohol use as a cancer risk factor but fewer than half included a goal, objective or strat-egy to address alcohol use. More than half of US adults reported current alcohol use in 2011, and two of three drinkers exceeded moderate drinking guidelines at least once in the past month. Many states that did not address alcohol use in comprehensive cancer <b>control</b> <b>plans</b> also had a high proportion of adults at risk. Conclusion: Alcohol use is a common cancer risk factor in the USA, but alcohol control strategies are not commonly included in comprehensive cancer <b>control</b> <b>plans.</b> Supporting the implementation of evi-dence-based strategies to prevent the excessive use of alcohol is one tool the cancer control community can use {{to reduce the risk of}} cancer...|$|R

500|$|Observers {{were posted}} to Spanish ports and borders, and both Ribbentrop and Grandi {{were told to}} agree to the plan, {{significant}} shipments already having taken place. Portugal would not accept observers, although it did agree to personnel attached to the British Embassy in Lisbon. The cost of the scheme was put at £898,000; Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia would each pay 16%; the other 20% would be met by the other 22 countries. Zones of patrol were assigned to each of the four nations; an International Board was set up to administer the scheme. The setting up of the scheme took until April. For the Republicans, this seemed like adding insult to injury – the wholesale transfer of arms to the Nationalists would now be policed by the very countries supplying them. Despite accusations that 60,000 Italians were now in Spain, and Grandi's announcement that he hoped no Italian volunteer would leave until the war was over, the German delegation appears to have hoped the <b>control</b> <b>plan</b> was effective. There were Italian assurances that Italy would not break up non-intervention.|$|E
500|$|After the Central Valley Project Improvement Act in 1991 and the Bay-Delta Water Quality <b>Control</b> <b>Plan</b> in 1995, {{much more}} water was {{required}} to meet target environmental flows in the Stanislaus and San Joaquin Rivers and the Delta, which conflicts with the original language of the 1962 act authorizing the dam, which stated that only [...] "excess water" [...] could be appropriated for these uses. One of the new requirements was for spring and autumn [...] "pulse flows" [...] intended to help migration of anadromous fish (Chinook salmon and steelhead trout in particular). This policy has been criticized by local irrigation districts as a waste of water during dry years, as fish populations have continued to struggle despite the additional flows. Reclamation officials argue that the flows are needed to meet state and federal requirements, {{as well as the}} earlier Endangered Species Act of 1972. As a result, the Melones Project is now only able to meet all its contracts in above average water years. Local water users have coined the somewhat derisive nickname of [...] "green dam" [...] because the policy has shifted to favor fish rather than farmers.|$|E
500|$|Bill and Jerri Osberg {{sued the}} state and seven other parties in April 2003 over runoff from the construction, {{claiming}} that it killed hundreds of trees and polluted ponds on their property. Later investigation uncovered damage to wildlife habitat in the Wisconsin River. Included in the original lawsuit were six individual WisDOT employees, the primary contractor and a local pet supply company. The court of appeals partially upheld a ruling by the district court dismissing the employees and the contractor from the lawsuit in March 2006. The pet supply company was reinstated in the case by the appeals court. The couple settled their claims, and the state pursued the matter against Pagel Construction in a related lawsuit. WisDOT alleged that the contractor did not follow proper erosion controls and failed to remediate the erosion damage to the Osbergs' property. The state wanted the construction company to forfeit their $70,000 retainer (equivalent to $ in [...] ) and pay damages of $150,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ). Pagel Construction faulted WisDOT's erosion <b>control</b> <b>plan</b> {{and said that the}} state's engineers controlled the project and was seeking the return of its retainer.

Vehicle emissions account for 31% of the city's smog sources, according to Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau. The local government has implemented already several policies to address air quality and congestion, such as a driving restriction scheme based upon the last digits on their license plates. Also a vehicle quota system was introduced in 2011, awarding new car licenses through a lottery, with a ceiling of 6 million units set by the city authority for 2017. In May 2016, the Beijing city legislature announced it will consider to start levying traffic congestion charges by 2020 as part of a package of measures to reform the vehicle quota system.

40|$|IntroductionComprehensive cancer <b>control</b> <b>plans</b> {{published}} by state, tribal, and territorial health agencies present {{an excellent opportunity}} to help prevent tobacco-related and other cancers. In this analysis, we sought to estimate {{the extent to which}} tobacco control activities outlined in state comprehensive cancer <b>control</b> <b>plans</b> incorporated the tobacco control recommendations presented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Best Practices for Comprehensive Tobacco Control Programs — August 1999 (Best Practices) and The Guide to Community Preventive Services: Tobacco Use Prevention and Control (The Guide). MethodsWe analyzed the 39 available state comprehensive cancer <b>control</b> <b>plans</b> to determine which of the CDC tobacco control recommendations were incorporated. We then summarized these data across the 39 states. ResultsThe 39 states incorporated a mean of 5. 6 recommendations from Best Practices (SD, 2. 8; range, 0 – 9) and 3. 9 recommendations from The Guide (SD, 1. 9; range, 0 – 6). Nearly one-half of state plans (48. 7 %) addressed funding for tobacco control; of these, 52. 6 % (25. 6 % of total) delineated a specific, measurable goal for funding. ConclusionThe extent to which tobacco control is addressed in state comprehensive cancer <b>control</b> <b>plans</b> varies widely.

40|$|These cancer <b>control</b> <b>plans</b> {{have arisen}} in {{response}} to the impact of cancer on the Australian community and in recognition of the health gains that can be made through effective cancer control. They have been developed either {{in the context of a}} broader framework of health policy or as specific endeavours in regard to cancer.

Most commonly, recommendations, goals, and targets within the cancer <b>control</b> <b>plans</b> have addressed points along the continuum of care, specific cancers, and frameworks and processes. The strength of these reports is their comprehensive approach in identifying priority cancers and areas where specific developments should impact on morbidity and mortality. In the future, cancer <b>control</b> <b>plans</b> should be better supported by economic evaluations, and greater financial support for implementation and regular assessment is needed to identify progress on cancer outcomes. The more recent national and State cancer <b>control</b> <b>plans</b> include the development of frameworks to foster a coordinated and cohesive approach to the delivery of cancer care. These plans represent important reforms in cancer care in Australia, and have the potential to reduce the impact of cancer on the community and improve health outcomes.  ...|$|R
