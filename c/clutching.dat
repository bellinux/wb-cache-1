5|$|A local landmark, the Fremont Troll—a large cement {{sculpture}} of a troll <b>clutching</b> a real-life Volkswagen Beetle—was installed under the bridge's north end in 1990. Up to half of the $40,000 cost for the artwork was donated from Seattle's Neighborhood Matching Fund, a local program {{to raise money for}} community projects. The sculpture was heavily vandalized in the year following its construction and large floodlights were installed on the bridge to discourage further damage.|$|E

5|$|Other {{aspects of}} feeding include the eyes, arms, and legs. The {{shape of the}} skull of Allosaurus limited {{potential}} binocular vision to 20° of width, slightly {{less than that of}} modern crocodilians. As with crocodilians, this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks. The arms, compared with those of other theropods, were suited for both grasping prey at a distance or <b>clutching</b> it close, and the articulation of the claws suggests that they could have been used to hook things. Finally, the top speed of Allosaurus has been estimated at 30 to 55kilometers per hour (19 to 34miles per hour).|$|E
5|$|Solar deities play a {{major role}} in many world {{religions}} and mythologies. The ancient Sumerians believed that the sun was Utu, the god of justice and twin brother of Inanna, the Queen of Heaven, who was identified as the planet Venus. Later, Utu was identified with the East Semitic god Shamash. Utu was regarded as a helper-deity, who aided those in distress, and, in iconography, he is usually portrayed with a long beard and <b>clutching</b> a saw, which represented his role as the dispenser of justice.|$|E
5|$|The William Harridge Trophy is the American League's {{counterpart}} to the Giles Trophy, and is presented {{each year to}} the American League champion by honorary league president Frank Robinson. The trophy features a golden eagle, the league's emblem, sitting atop a silver baseball and <b>clutching</b> the American League banner. The trophy is named for Will Harridge, who was league president from 1931 to 1958. The Houston Astros are the current holders of the Harridge Trophy in honor of their 2017 American League championship, after defeating The New York Yankees. Unlike its National League counterpart, a new trophy is awarded each year.|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a mechanical <b>clutch</b> which limits transmission of torque to a desired, predetermined maximum torque from a first <b>clutch</b> plate to a second <b>clutch</b> plate. More specifically, the mechanical <b>clutch</b> includes at least one stepper member, preferably three or more evenly spaced stepper members, which transmit the torque from a first <b>clutch</b> plate to a second <b>clutch</b> plate providing a desired maximum torque is not exceeded. However, if the desired maximum torque is exceeded, the stepper member will rotate and move between the <b>clutch</b> plates so that the torque to the second <b>clutch</b> plate does not exceed the desired maximum torque. The desired maximum torque is set by the axial force compressing the stepper member between the <b>clutch</b> plates and when the applied torque to the first <b>clutch</b> plate exceeds the desired torque, the stepper member will rotate between the <b>clutch</b> plates rather than transmit that torque to the second <b>clutch</b> plate...|$|R
5|$|The twins {{had been}} in Ireland before {{travelling}} to England and boarding a coach for London at Liverpool. Their odd behaviour after exiting the coach at a service station on the M6 – including not allowing the bags they were <b>clutching</b> to be searched – caused the driver not to allow them back on the coach. The two were later seen on the central reservation of the M6. When Highways Agency Traffic Officers arrived to assist the women, they ran across the busy motorway. Ursula managed to dodge traffic; Sabina was first struck by a SEAT León.|$|E
5|$|A set of {{fourteen}} redesigned Major Arcana tarot cards, {{based on the}} Rider-Waite deck, were commissioned by the singer for the album's artwork. The cards depict band members in surrealistic tableau. Each card was reinterpreted to reflect the iconography of the album's lyrical content: The Fool is stepping off a cliff, with grainy images of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and a JFK campaign poster in the background; The Emperor, with prosthetic legs, {{is sitting in a}} wheelchair <b>clutching</b> a rifle in front of an American flag; Justice weighs the Bible against the brain on his balance scale. The album's inner sleeve contains these three images, along with a further nine: The Magician, The High Priestess, The Hierophant, The Hermit, Death, The Devil, The Tower, The Star and The World. The cover itself represents The Hanged Man.|$|E
5|$|As {{its name}} suggests, Green Lantern is themed for the DC Comics {{character}} of the same name. The theme was chosen {{to coincide with the}} Green Lantern film scheduled for release in 2011. The track is painted green, {{with the exception of the}} yellow vertical loop. The second corkscrew was originally the track section which was going to be yellow, but it was decided to switch the scheme to the first loop. The loop is yellow because Green Lantern's enemy is the yellow Parallax. In June 2011, a Parallax cutout with <b>clutching</b> arms through which the train passes was placed at the bottom of the first drop. The ride's queue area features a series of comic-book-style boards relating the story of Hal Jordan (the Green Lantern) and the Green Lantern Corps.|$|E
40|$|The {{parasitic}} wasp Achrysocharoides zwoelferi (Hymenoptera, Eulophidae) produces <b>clutches</b> consisting {{of only one}} sex. Moreover, male <b>clutch</b> size is invariably one while female <b>clutches</b> {{are in the range}} one to four. We designed field experiments to determine the effect of host quality on <b>clutch</b> composition. We found that solitary male and solitary female <b>clutches</b> were reared from the same size mines, and that larger mines tended to produce gregarious female <b>clutches.</b> A higher proportion of male <b>clutches</b> were placed in older hosts, despite their large size. Variation in body size, both between and within <b>clutches,</b> was measured in order to test the predictions of models that take into account the constraint that <b>clutch</b> size is an integer trait, something of potential importance when absolute <b>clutch</b> size is low. Our data supported several predictions of these models, including the trade-off-invariant rule for optimal offspring size developed by Charnov and Downhower. However, while most invertebrate <b>clutch</b> size models assume equal resource share among members of the same <b>clutch,</b> we found an increase in inequality in larger <b>clutches...</b>|$|R

The jury deliberated for less than seven hours before convicting him on July 24, 1979 of the Bowman and Levy murders, three counts of attempted first degree murder (for the assaults on Kleiner, Chandler and Thomas) and two counts of burglary. Trial judge Edward Cowart imposed death sentences for the murder convictions.|$|E
5|$|Candi Sukuh {{temple of}} Ngancar, East Java, {{was built in}} the 10th century and is {{dedicated}} to Shiva and is evidence of Tantric ritual in Hinduism and the fertility cult practiced at the time and preoccupation with the lingga. The temple has numerous reliefs graphically depicting sexuality and fertility including several stone depictions of a copulating penis and vagina. It consists of a pyramid with reliefs and statues at the front. Among them is a male statue <b>clutching</b> his penis, with three tortoises with flattened shells. The temple once had a striking 1.82 metre (5'11.5ft) representation of lingga with four testicles; this is now housed in the National Museum of Indonesia.
