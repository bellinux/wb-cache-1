The buildings were constructed in the Georgian and Regency periods between 1770 and 1855, designed by architects such as James Hamilton, and were commissioned by wealthy businessmen, including those that {{were involved in the}} growth of Bath. These terraces form a long, <b>continuous</b> <b>arc</b> of buildings which face Weymouth Bay along the esplanade. The earliest purpose-built hotel there was the first incarnation of the Royal Hotel. The esplanade features the multi-coloured Jubilee Clock, erected in 1887 to mark the 50th year of Queen Victoria's reign.

Sometimes a brush may be formed of only {{six or seven}} branches, these being broad and highly luminous, of a purple colour, and in some parts an inch or more apart: by a spark discharge at the prime conductor (1455.) single brushes may be obtained at pleasure. Discharge {{in the form of}} a brush is favoured by rarefaction of the air, in the same manner and for the same reason as discharge {{in the form of a}} spark (1375.); but in every case there is previous induction and charge through the dielectric, and polarity of its particles (1437.), the induction being, as in any other instance, alternately raised by the machine and lowered by the discharge. In certain experiments the rarefaction was increased to the utmost degree, and the opposed conducting surfaces brought as near together as possible without producing glow (1529.): the brushes then contracted in their lateral dimensions, and recurred so rapidly as to form an apparently <b>continuous</b> <b>arc</b> of light from metal to metal. Still the discharge could be observed to intermit (1427.), so that even under these high conditions, induction preceded each single brush, and the tense polarized condition of the contiguous particles was a necessary preparation for the discharge itself.|$|E

It is shown here that this grouping is coincidental with investigations of pulsed and <b>continuous</b> <b>arcs.</b> All results can be consolidated by taking ion-neutral interaction into account, especially charge exchange collisions with the metal neutrals produced by the arc itself. The velocity distribution functions are independent of charge state when produced at cathode spots but become charge-state dependent when the plasma interacts with neutrals...|$|R

50|$|A {{commonly}} used device requiring a trigger transformer are strobe lights. Strobe lights {{consist of a}} tube containing an inert gas, such as xenon. Capacitors inside the light are charged up to a relatively high voltage, roughly 300 Volts for small strobes. This voltage itself is not capable of ionizing the gas in the flash tube, and the tube will not fire. If the capacitors were charged to a voltage high enough to ionize the tube, {{the result would be}} no longer a flash, but a <b>continuous</b> <b>arc</b> as the voltage is sufficient to maintain ionization in the flash tube.|$|E

The process can culminate in corona discharges, [...] streamers, leaders, or in a spark or <b>continuous</b> <b>arc</b> that completely bridges the gap between the electrical conductors that are applying the voltage. The process extends to huge sparks — streamers in lightning discharges propagate by formation of electron avalanches created in the high potential gradient ahead of the streamers' advancing tips. Once begun, avalanches are often intensified by the creation of photoelectrons as a result of ultraviolet radiation emitted by the excited medium's atoms in the aft-tip region.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In thispaper, a {{curvilinear}} tool pathgenerationmethodwith implicitmovingbound-aries {{is presented}} for pocket machining. The pocket profile is implicitly embedded into a higher-dimensional function, namely the level set function, and is represented with the zero level set as a moving boundary. In order to generate low-curvature parallel boundaries, curva-ture flow motion is adopted during {{the evolution of}} the moving boundaries. The topological changes of the profile offsets are naturally handled by propagating the moving boundaries. The curvilinear tool path is then constructed between adjacent offsets. For complex pockets with elongated narrow sections, the implicit medial axis transformation is proposed to partition the large rounded region and elongated regions. The large rounded pocket region employs the pro-posed curvilinear tool path, and the elongated narrow regions use <b>continuous</b> <b>arcs,</b> respectively. The proposed tool path generationmethod is suitable for high-speedmachining of pockets with islands and consists of both rounded and elongated narrow regions...|$|R
40|$|A string graph is the {{intersection}} graph {{of a collection}} of <b>continuous</b> <b>arcs</b> in the plane. We show that any string graph with m edges can be separated into two parts of roughly equal size by the removal of O(m^ 3 / 4 √(m)) vertices. This result is then used to deduce that every string graph with n vertices and no complete bipartite subgraph Kt,t has at most ctn edges, where ct is a constant depending only on t. Another application shows that locally tree-like string graphs are globally tree-like: for any ε > 0, there is an integer g(ε) such that every string graph with n vertices and girth at least g(ε) has at most (1 + ε) n edges. Furthermore, the number of such labelled graphs is at most (1 + ε) nT(n), where T(n) = nn− 2 is the number of labelled trees on n vertice...|$|R
50|$|The snake {{style is}} known as Shesha-naga Yudhan, named after the serpent lord Shesha.

It begins with a salutation in which the arms are brought upwards from the sides in a <b>continuous</b> <b>arc</b> til the hands are straight above the head. In contrast to the straightforward blows of its counterpart, the snake style is subtle and focuses on parrying attacks and striking at vital points with looping circular motions. Characteristic of the snake style is the entangling of limbs, combined with whipping strikes, locks, joint manipulation, and chokeholds. Its weapons include scarves, knives, axes and spears.|$|E

50|$|The Cocos Plate {{was created}} by sea floor {{spreading}} along the East Pacific Rise and the Cocos Ridge, specifically in a complicated area geologists call the Cocos-Nazca spreading system. From the rise the plate is pushed eastward and pushed or dragged (perhaps both) under the less dense overriding Caribbean Plate, in the process called subduction. The subducted leading edge heats up and adds its water to the mantle above it. In the mantle layer called the asthenosphere, mantle rock melts to make magma, trapping superheated water under great pressure. As a result, to the northeast of the subducting edge lies the <b>continuous</b> <b>arc</b> of volcanos —also known as the Central America Volcanic Arc— stretching from Costa Rica to Guatemala, and a belt of earthquakes that extends farther north, into Mexico.|$|E

40|$|Hybrid {{propulsion}} combines chemical propulsion {{and electric}} propulsion {{on the same}} platform. The brand-new hybrid transfers are thus achieved by sequential combination of high thrust (impulsive maneuvers) and low thrust (<b>continuous</b> <b>arcs).</b> In this chapter, hybrid propulsion transfers are applied to the trajectory optimization for missions to the Near Earth Objects (NEOs). These have been obtained with an optimization based on a direct transcription procedure. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem and solved for a finite set of variables, which maximize the final spacecraft mass. Effort has been put in modeling the propulsion subsystem. Realistic limitations on both the impulsive maneuvers and low-thrust magnitude have been considered, as well as gravity losses and variation of available electrical power with {{the distance from the}} Sun. The transfer to asteroid 162173 / 1999 JU 3 is considered as case study.
