40|$|The cutter-workpiece contact of an {{end mill}} fluctuates when cutting along a {{curvilinear}} tool path. It increases sharply when reaching a concave corner. Since conventional contour-parallel tool-path cutting {{does not take}} this condition into account, it will cause a momentarily rise of cutting resistance in concave corner regions, producing undesirable effects such as machine chatter, gouging and even cutter breakage. This paper proposes to use machining tactics in which a corner-looping tool path is employed to remorse progressively the concentrated material at corner regions, thereby restricting the cutting resistance to an acceptable level. Different <b>corner</b> <b>types</b> are categorised and the procedures of generating the proposed machining tactics are described.

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} diffusion {{equation is}} considered which models the temperature distribution in a laser-sustained plasma subject to wind. As certain parameters are small a singular perturbation problem arises and {{the method of}} matched asymptotic expansions is applied to approximate the solution. An essential role in this problem is played by the plasma front. This is a free surface separating the plasma and non-plasma phases. One of the main results is that we derive a 1 st order nonlinear P. D. E. of Hamilton-Jacobi type, which describes {{certain parts of the}} free surface in the stationary case. This equation is analysed for various wind directions. It appears that for the initial conditions for these parts of this free surface there are different possibilities depending on the wind direction. We show further that the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation can contain singularities of <b>corner</b> <b>type.</b> Furthermore, the effect of wind on the stability region of the stationary full plasma solution is analysed. The method of analysis presented in this paper is not restricted to the cone-like geometry or the specific form of the non-linearity of the problem considered here, but has potentially a much wider scope. However, the case under study in this paper is certainly representative for the effects that have to be taken into account...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Laser welding {{is known}} for its low heat input {{compared}} to arc welding methods. This could enable laser welding of sheet metals with lighter fastening solutions and less time-consuming tack welding alternatives. A feasibility study was carried out to study four different <b>corner</b> joint <b>types</b> for 2 mm thick cold-rolled steel sheet by using filler-free laser welding. The aim of the research was to get more experimental knowledge about the laser welding of corner joints. Also possible benefits concerning faster manufacturing times and smaller costs by developing fastening applications for small batch laser welding was to be studied in practice. The 170 mm long joints were welded without air gap or pressing. All <b>corner</b> joint <b>types</b> proved to be weldable with a continuous wave Yb:YAG diode-pumped disk laser. It was also found during the experiment that laser welding enables the use of light and inexpensive fasteners such as magnetic holders instead of traditional clamps and fixturing. With some joint types, the insufficient fastening power of magnetic fasteners against distortions was compensated by making a spot-like laser tack weld {{at the end of the}} weld before welding the actual seam. This showed that it is possible to make precise and small tack welds with a laser and to use laser-tacking in sheet metal assembly...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} five {{experimental}} parameters in pulsed laser vaporization (PLV) synthesis of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were examined. Parameters investigated include the laser beam raster pattern, reactor chamber temperature, graphite particle {{size in the}} target, reactor chamber configuration, and incident laser beam power density. The type and quality of resultant SWNTs synthesized were strongly influenced by altering these experimental conditions. This information can then be utilized to allow the experimentalist to exhibit a considerable degree {{of control over the}} physical and chemical properties of the as-produced SWNT materials. Characterization of the SWNT products was achieved using a combination of Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. SWNTs synthesized using the <b>corner</b> to <b>corner</b> <b>type</b> laser beam raster pattern have pronounced differences in contrast to those synthesized using a linear type raster pattern. Smaller SWNT diameters result from use of a corner to corner raster pattern. Production rate of SWNT material is doubled using a one shot corner to corner raster pattern versus a one shot move linear raster pattern. These results indicate that there is a diminution of metal enrichment at the target surface was observed using the corner to corner raster pattern due to a reduction of induced localized heating of the target. Increasing reactor chamber temperature produces SWNTs with larger diameters. SWNT yields within the as-produced material increase with increasing temperature up to 1100 °C. Defect densities are decreased with increasing temperature. Smaller graphite particle sizes give higher SWNT yields. An increase in reactor chamber volume increases SWNT yield. Increasing power densities result in a decrease in SWNT diameters. By carefully controlling the power density in combination with raster pattern the amount of graphite in the final product can be minimized...|$|R
