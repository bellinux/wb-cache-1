5000|$|JoJos third studio release, {{which was}} {{announced}} in 2007, was originally slated to be titled [...] "All I Want Is Everything" [...] before morphing into [...] "Jumping Trains" [...] in 2011. Originally scheduled for release in early 2009, the album has been delayed {{for more than five}} years due to issues with her record label, Da Family Entertainment, and the sorting out of distribution for the album. The album was reported finalized in June 2009, but more recording sessions were done for the album up until January 2011. Her debut mixtape Cant Take That Away from Me was released on September 7, 2010 through Rap-Up.com as a prelude to her third album and to hold over her paitent fans with a video released for the song [...] "In The Dark".

I haven’t <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> it, but if you listen to the difference between “Disaster” and “Demonstrate,” they don’t fit on the same album. So with the release of “Demonstrate” and the feedback it’s been getting, it reconfirmed for me that I’m doing the right thing. I want a very consistent, cohesive body of work and that’s what I’m working on finishing up. It doesn’t really bother me that I’ve been working on something for four years. I just want it to be right. Whatever the timing happens to be, whether it’s the end of this year or early next year, I just pray that it’s right. I’m almost done with the tracks that I would consider the album to be. It’s just about fine-tuning and sitting down with my team and things like that."Demonstrate" [...] was written by JoJo, Daniel Daley, Anthony Jeffries and Noah [...] "40" [...] Shebib who also produced the track. Noah [...] "40" [...] Shebib is known for his work on Drakes sophomore studio album, Take Care as well as Alicia Keys [...] "Un-Thinkable (Im Ready)". [...] "Demonstrate" [...] is an R&B driven song and is about demonstrating your thoughts, she sings [...] "Baby there’s a lot of freaky shit running my mind that/I can’t say, but I know I can demonstrate". It is set for release through digital distribution on August 28, 2012. following the release of Demonstrate JoJo says [...] "Im headed in a new direction, so I wanted to start fresh with new everything, Demonstrate just felt like how I want to continue on with this journey and the next step. For me, the third album is a really big moment in someones career, so I wanted to make sure that we are leading off with the right thing." ...|$|E
