50|$|Previous to the {{introduction}} of this algorithm, the usual way to search within text was to examine each character of the text for the first character of the pattern. Once that was found the subsequent characters of the text would be compared to the characters of the pattern. If no match occurred then the text would again be <b>checked</b> <b>character</b> by character in an effort to find a match. Thus almost every character in the text needs to be examined.|$|R
