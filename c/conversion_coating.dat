Overall, results consistently pointed to a slight temper effect. <b>Conversion</b> <b>coated</b> AA 7475 -T 7 was significantly more corrosion resistant than <b>conversion</b> <b>coated</b> AA 7475 -T 6. In AA 7075, there was only a slight difference in corrosion resistance between the two tempers. This was attributed to the effect of constituent particles on coating formation and breakdown, which are present to a much greater extent in AA 7075 than in AA 7475. The difference in the corrosion resistance between the T 6 and T 7 tempers in the coated and uncoated conditions is about the same suggesting that the origin of any “temper effect ” in <b>conversion</b> <b>coated</b> materials is ultimately due to the intrinsic change in corrosion susceptibility of the alloy itself.

40|$|July 2013. ""A Dissertation Presented to the Faculty of the Graduate School at the University of Missouri [...] Columbia In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy. "Dissertation adviser: Dr. Qingsong Yu. Includes vita. This {{dissertation}} {{reports the}} research results obtained in investigating low pressure plasma coatings for corrosion protection of aluminum ion vapor deposition (IVD) coated high-strength steels and in studying atmospheric non-thermal plasmas for destruction of oral bacteria. The objective of investigating plasma coatings for protection of IVD coated {{high strength steel}} is to reduce damage from corrosion and prevent its hydrogen re-embrittlement that often occurs in aircraft. In this study, we completed the design and construction of a hybrid IVD/plasma coater, which has the capability of producing both aluminum IVD coatings and plasma coatings of trimethylsilane (TMS). Both IVD Al coating and TMS plasma coatings were successfully prepared by the hybrid coater. The coating properties of the resulted IVD coating and TMS plasma coating were characterized and evaluated. Corrosion property evaluation using potentiodynamic polarization technique indicated that TMS plasma coated IVD specimens showed {{a decrease in the}} magnitude of corrosion potential and a decrease in corrosion current compared to bare IVD, and thus better corrosion resistance. Corrosion test results from SO 2 salt spray test showed that a similar amount of corrosion products were found with the plasma coated IVD specimens as their controls, i. e., chromate <b>conversion</b> <b>coated</b> IVD samples, and did not form visible amounts of red rust after 504 hours neutral salt fog. Hydrogen re-embrittlement testing demonstrated that TMS plasma coated IVD specimens gave better test results as compared with bare IVD samples. This result is believed to be due to the improved corrosion resistance of the TMS plasma coated IVD specimens and thus less amount of hydrogen formation as a corrosion by product. It was further found that IVD Al coating should be exposed to oxygen or air in order to create an oxide layer before organosilane coatings are applied for stronger corrosion resistance.

This finding reflected a rather insignificant macroscopic acceleration of corrosion processes for samples that were strained by up to 15 %. Similarly, accelerated oxygen reduction driven electrolyte spreading on bare conversion film covered HDG surfaces was verifiable only on a pm scale during initial process stages. This confirmed that stretching-induced defect formation increased the electrochemical activity of the substrates, but neither effectively nor significantly promoted the kinetics of ion transport along the sample surfaces in the present case.

Protein synthesis and proline uptake were measured to assess the effect of each poison on cellular high-energy phosphate and on the transmembrane protonmotive force, respectively.

40|$|<b>Conversion</b> and <b>coating</b> of {{particle}} nuclear fuel is performed in spouted (fluidized) bed reactors. The reactor must {{be capable of}} operating at temperatures up to 2000 °C in inert, flammable, and coating gas environments. The spouted bed reactor geometry is defined by a graphite retort with a 2. 5 inch inside diameter, conical section with a 60 ° included angle, and a 4 mm gas inlet orifice diameter through which particles are removed from the reactor {{at the completion of}} each run. The particles may range from 200 µm to 2 mm in diameter. Maintaining optimal gas flow rates slightly above the minimum spouting velocity throughout the duration of each run is complicated by the variation {{of particle}} size and density as <b>conversion</b> and/or <b>coating</b> reactions proceed in addition to gas composition and temperature variations. In order to achieve uniform particle coating, prevent agglomeration of the particle bed, and monitor the reaction progress, a spouted bed monitoring system was developed. The monitoring system includes a high-sensitivity, low-response time differential pressure transducer paired with a signal processing, data acquisition, and process control unit which allows for real-time monitoring and control of the spouted bed reactor. The pressure transducer is mounted upstream of the spouted bed reactor gas inlet. The gas flow into the reactor induces motion of the particles in the bed and prevents the particles from draining from the reactor due to gravitational forces. Pressure fluctuations in the gas inlet stream are generated as the particles in the bed interact with the entering gas stream. The pressure fluctuations are produced by bulk movement of the bed, generation and movement of gas bubbles through the bed, and the individual motion of particles and particle subsets in the bed. The pressure fluctuations propagate upstream to the pressure transducer where they can be monitored. Pressure fluctuation, mean differential pressure, gas flow rate, reactor operating temperature data from the spouted bed monitoring system are used to determine the bed operating regime and monitor the particle characteristics. Tests have been conducted to determine the sensitivity of the monitoring system to the different operating regimes of the spouted particle bed. The pressure transducer signal response was monitored over a range of particle sizes and gas flow rates while holding bed height constant. During initial testing, the bed monitoring system successfully identified the spouting regime as well as when particles became interlocked and spouting ceased. The particle characterization capabilities of the bed monitoring system are currently being tested and refined. A feedback control module for the bed monitoring system is currently under development. The feedback control module will correlate changes in the bed response to changes in the particle characteristics and bed spouting regime resulting from the <b>coating</b> and/or <b>conversion</b> process. The feedback control module will then adjust the gas composition, gas flow rate, and run duration accordingly to maintain the bed in the desired spouting regime and produce optimally coated/converted particles...|$|R
