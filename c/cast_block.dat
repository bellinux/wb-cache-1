5000|$|The Building at 826 North Main Street, at 826 N. Main St. in Cottonwood, Arizona, USA, {{was built}} in 1925. It is a 25 x 75 ft {{building}} built of <b>cast</b> <b>block</b> and is significant of an example of better fire protection in construction following a 1925 fire in Cottonwood's business district. This building {{is reported to be}} one of only three examples of using <b>cast</b> <b>block</b> in particular, in Cottonwood, and [...] "the only example of its use for residential purposes", although the building has in fact been used since for commercial purposes.|$|E
50|$|Mounting systems vary greatly, from {{a simple}} <b>cast</b> <b>block</b> on the shell which accepts and clamps to a rod {{attached}} to a clamp or holder to much more sophisticated arrangements {{where there is no}} attachment to the shell, instead a frame clamps to the tuning lugs.|$|E
5000|$|The British Air Ministry {{issued its}} Specification R.24/31 for a [...] "General Purpose Open Sea Patrol Flying Boat" [...] in 1931 and ordered one {{prototype}} {{from each of}} Saunders-Roe, Supermarine and Shorts. Whereas the other two companies opted for traditional biplane designs, Shorts decided to produce a more modern, all-metal monoplane aircraft with the experimental steam-cooled, <b>cast</b> <b>block</b> Rolls-Royce Goshawk engine, itself a development of the smaller Kestrel engine.|$|E
40|$|The present article {{shows the}} results of the {{theoretical}} and empirical research of the study of the impact made by acoustical oscillations on the working process of a gas-impulsive moulding device with the purpose of increasing the quality of the casting blocks' seal and decreasing the roughness of the surface of a <b>casting</b> <b>block.</b> It has been shown that acoustical oscillations intensify the working process of the gas-impulsive moulding device. With the increase of frequency and power of oscillations the hardness of a <b>casting</b> <b>block</b> first sharply rises, but then gradually decreases. It has been found out that oscillations may help to adjust the precision of a <b>casting</b> <b>block</b> due to high sensitivity of a gas-impulsive process to the frequency of oscillations. The use of acoustical oscillations broadens technological opportunities of the moulding device...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is also architecturally significant. It {{is one of}} the earliest examples of pre-cast concrete modular construction. Ninety percent of the {{building is}} built with only six basic <b>cast</b> <b>blocks,</b> the most basic being the T-Block, a precursor of today's standard concrete block.|$|R
25|$|Sodium {{hydroxide}} is industrially {{produced as}} a 50% solution by {{variations of the}} electrolytic chloralkali process. Chlorine gas is also produced in this process. Solid sodium hydroxide is obtained from this solution by the evaporation of water. Solid sodium hydroxide is most commonly sold as flakes, prills, and <b>cast</b> <b>blocks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1961, the Classic was {{available}} in either an I6 - 195.6 CID L - or with a V8 - 250 CID L - engine. A lighter by 80 lb aluminum block version of the OHV I6 engine, {{sometimes referred to as}} the 196, was offered as an option on Deluxe and Super models. The die <b>cast</b> <b>block</b> features iron [...] "sleeves" [...] or cylinder liners with a cast iron alloy cylinder head and produces the same [...] as the cast iron version.|$|E
5000|$|The TM 65 (Telamiina 65) is a {{circular}} Finnish minimum metal anti-tank blast mine. It is broadly {{based on the}} Russian TM-62 mine. The mines body is made from a thin shell of fibreglass over a <b>cast</b> <b>block</b> of explosive, with a central fuze well that holds the pressure fuze. The original TM 65 used a US-65 fuze as used in the SM-65 anti-personnel mine, the later TM 65 77 uses a pressure fuze similar to the Russian MV-5 fuze called Painesytytin 77.|$|E
50|$|The MAT-76 {{is a large}} {{circular}} Romanian minimum metal anti-tank blast mine. It {{is similar}} to the MAT-62B mine, sharing a fuze. The mine is actually a <b>cast</b> <b>block</b> of TNT with a thin coating of fibreglass. The mine has a central fuze well that normally uses a P-62 pressure fuze, although it can be used with any of the fuzes designed for the Russian TM-62 and TM-72 series of mines. The bakelite plastic used in the fuze of a MAT-76 may become brittle in desert conditions, which can reduce the activation pressure. This may make the mine unstable i.e. can detonate simply by handling it. The mine is found in Angola, Iraq, Kuwait, Liberia, Mozambique, and Zambia.|$|E
50|$|A {{very similar}} engine {{developed}} for the United States Navy was the 540T. This engine used a welded block. The welded construction was required because the specified shock tolerance requirements prohibit the use of <b>cast</b> <b>blocks.</b> The Navy 540 was used in Patrol Boats, Mine Sweepers, Mine Layers, and tug boats.|$|R

50|$|The engine {{initially}} displaced 379 cuin L, {{though the}} potential for larger displacements was engineered into the design. It had SOHCs actuating the valves via roller-tipped rockers mounted on rockershafts flanking the centrally located camshaft. Just like the FE Cammer, this allows splayed valves. It has a bore spacing of 4.53 inches, a stroke of 3.74 inches, a bore of 4.015 inches, and a deep-skirted thinwall <b>casting</b> <b>block</b> with cross-bolted mains. The 1950s-designed 390 FE had a bore spacing of 4.63 inches, a stroke of 3.78 inches, a bore of 4.05 inches, and a deep-skirted thinwall <b>casting</b> <b>block.</b> The SOHC version of the FE with cross-bolted maincaps, developed in 1965, had single overhead cams actuating the valves via roller-tipped rockers. A 427 cuin L version of the new Boss engine was put together and tested. It produced 700 hp.|$|R
5000|$|The TMA-4 is a {{circular}} plastic cased Yugoslavian minimum metal anti-tank blast mine. It is a modernized {{version of the}} TMA-3. The mine is basically a <b>cast</b> <b>block</b> of TNT with three fuze wells cut into it, encased in plastic. Three black plastic UTMA-4 fuzes are installed into the top surface of the mine. A thin rope carry handle is also provided. The small pressure plate area of the fuzes make the mine resistant to overpressure from explosive demining techniques. Additionally the low metal content of the mine {{make it very difficult}} to detect. Although no secondary fuze well is provided, {{it is possible that the}} mine could be fitted with improvised anti-handling devices.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{prototype}} was {{assembled in}} 1964 with LM8 aluminium alloy sand <b>cast</b> <b>block</b> and flanged cast iron liners, EN4A forged and nitrided 7 main bearing crankshaft for 4994 cc (87 mm × 70 mm). This racing engine, with its intake ports {{in between the}} intake and the exhaust camshafts, came {{out to be the}} fuel injected 5L DOHC Jaguar XJ13 engine in 1966, but more importantly, it was further developed by the same team into the series-production 5.3 L SOHC V12 engine. [...] This engine, with characteristically long intake tracts connecting the four carburetors on the outside of cam covers to the intake ports inside the V angle, came out to the market on Jaguar E-Type in 1971, on Jaguar XJ12 in 1972, and, together with the later 6.0 L version, remained in production until 1997.|$|E
5000|$|The 301.6 (4.9L) GMC inline six was {{produced}} from 1952 to 1960, {{when it was}} replaced by the V6. It has a 4.00" [...] bore and a 4.00" [...] stroke. This is the largest raised-deck engine. It was originally designed for the GMC military M135 and M211. It was used in military 2.5 ton trucks with the HydraMatic transmission; however, the engine was a sealed engine for snorkel/submersion use, had an electric fuel pump, and other features such as a deep sump oil pan. From 1952 to 1959, GMC manufactured the civilian 302 engine, which was not sealed, had a mechanical fuel pump, and used a [...] "standard" [...] oil pan. This engine was popular with hotrod enthusiasts because it delivered tremendous power for an inline six engine at the time (although now obsolete), is truck built with a heavy <b>cast</b> <b>block,</b> and can take quite a bit of abuse.|$|E

5000|$|The {{engine of}} the VF1000R was the same <b>cast</b> <b>block</b> as in the VF1000F, {{displacing}} the same 998 cc's as the standard model, but modifications were required to mount the gear train in each head, used for driving the cams. The crankshaft was also altered, in order to accept a straight-cut gear which would drive the gear train instead of the chain system, used in the [...] "F" [...] model. Each head had 2 gears held by a carrier, which was then bolted into the respective head, driving {{each of the two}} camshafts arranged in a dual overhead camshaft arrangement for each head. Total, there were 9 gears required to transmit power from the crankshaft to all 4 camshafts. The camshafts were altered in relation to the ones found on the [...] "F" [...] model in order to provide more power. This arrangement added 7 pounds to the weight of the engine when compared to the chain driven arrangement present in the [...] "F" [...] model.|$|E
5000|$|The Alco 539T was {{a diesel}} prime mover (locomotive engine) {{built by the}} American Locomotive Company. This engine was also used as a {{stationary}} powerplant, used in pipeline pumping stations, tugboats and dredges. It has a straight-six, four-stroke design in a <b>cast</b> <b>block</b> which produced from [...] The engine has a bore (cylinder diameter) of 12.5 in, and a stroke of 13 in. The 539 engine was built at Alco's Auburn, New York engine plant and later starting in September 1949 in Canada. The 539T was equipped with the Buchi turbocharger, being made under license by the Elliott Manufacturing Company of Jeannette, Pennsylvania. The first 539T engines were used in S-2 switchers and DL-105 passenger locomotives built in September 1940. Alco locomotives using this engine include the S-2, S-4, RS-1, RSC-1, RSD-1, DL-105, DL-107, DL-108, DL-109, and DL-110. MLW locomotives using this engine include the S-2, S-4, S-7, S-12, RS-1, and RSC-13.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the start}} of World War I, Hispano-Suiza turned to the design and {{production}} of aircraft engines {{under the direction of}} Marc Birkigt. His chief engineer during this period was another Swiss, Louis Massuger. Traditionally, aircraft engines were manufactured by machining separate steel cylinders and then bolting these assemblies directly to the crankcase. Birkigt's novel solution called for the engine block to be formed from a single piece of cast aluminum, and into which thin steel liners were secured. Manufacturing an engine in this way simplified construction and resulted in a lighter, yet stronger more durable engine. Thus, Birkigt's new construction method created the first practical, and what are commonly known today as, [...] "cast block" [...] engines. His aluminum <b>cast</b> <b>block</b> V-8 design was also noteworthy for incorporating overhead camshafts, propeller reduction gearing and other desirable features that would not appear together on competitor's engines until the late 1920s. Another major design feature, for the later HS.8B line was the use of a hollow propeller shaft for both the 8B and 8C gear-reduction versions, which when used for the HS.8C versions specifically engineered to accommodate one, to allow heavy calibre (usually 37 mm) projectile firing through the hollow propeller shaft, avoiding the need for a synchronization gear, a feature used in future Hispano-Suiza military engines. Hispano-Suiza's aero engines, produced at its own factories and under license, became the most commonly used aero engines in the French and British air forces, powering over half the alliance's fighter aircraft.|$|E

40|$|The {{testing of}} a {{prototype}} of an automotive Stirling engine, the Mod II, is discussed. The Mod II is a one-piece <b>cast</b> <b>block</b> with a V- 4 single-crankshaft configuration and an annular regenerator/cooler design. The initial testing of Mod II concentrated on the basic engine, with auxiliaries driven by power sources external to the engine. The performance of the engine was tested at 720 C set temperature and 820 C tube temperature. At 720 C, it is observed that the power deficiency is speed dependent and linear, with a weak pressure dependency, and at 820 C, the power deficiency is speed and pressure dependent. The effects of buoyancy and nozzle spray pattern on the heater temperature spread are investigated. The characterization of the oil pump and the operating cycle and temperature spread tests are proposed for further evaluation of the engine...|$|E

40|$|Heavy-section {{castings}} made of {{spheroidal graphite}} cast irons {{are known to}} be prone to graphite degeneracy. Upon the various degenerate forms of graphite reported in the literature, chunky graphite is the most common and detrimental one. A great deal of effort has been made for many years to prevent its formation but no convincing description of the factors controlling its appearance has been given so far. In large-size castings, chunky graphite generally appears away from the surface and its occurrence is made evident on a metallographic section by a darker contrast. Because of this sharp and clear transition between the non-affected and the affected zones, several authors looked for chemical heterogeneities at the scale of the part but all concluded to the absence of macrosegregation. This paper presents experimental evidence based on differential thermal analyses that metallurgical differences do exist in samples machined out of the affected and nonaffected zones of a single <b>cast</b> <b>block...</b>|$|E
