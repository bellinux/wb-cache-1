40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the theory of}} Socio-Technical Systems (STS) {{within the context of}} Information Systems (IS), a complicated field combining Information Technology and social shaping impacts. IS have been changing our society for some decades. From Office Automation (OA) to E-Commerce and E-government, IS are creating a new era of Mobilisation. Different industries have all been adopting Information Technology to enhance their business, from enterprises to public sectors. All these changes bring dramatic impacts for organisational behaviour and people's living, which need to be studied. According to academic literature, health informatics, being one of the important and complex fields in IS, started to employ mobile technical systems to improve healthcare service delivery for citizens {{at the start of the}} new Millennium. Comparing with other theoretical models in IS, the author argues that the Socio-Technical approach can explain comprehensively the new <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>organisations</b> and society. Following the theories of STS, these case studies were decided by the researchers as field work in Chinese Community Healthcare Service Centres, where there are various mobile services for the citizens. Through multiple case studies, the author found that Leader Emphasis is one new social element in the field of the IS, while Participation, as another social element is essential to the context of this research project. These two social shaping elements, combining together within a model of STS, provide new decision making process, which is vital to a successful development of Mobile Health Information Systems (MHIS). The model has affected organisational behaviour, organisational structure, culture and society, following the usage of Mobile IS. Based on the result of the field work and the relevant literature of E-govemment, this research also concludes that M-govemment can be the transformation of E-govemment, as public service can be delivered efficiently by Mobile IS. A developing model is presented in this thesis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{attribute}} {{focus in}} engineering education now {{adopted by the}} engineering education accrediting bodies of the US, UK and Australia is based on meeting the assumed needs of professional practice. It is associated with an increasing expectation by employers of work-ready graduates {{rather than relying on}} subsequent work-based learning and experience to develop many of the essential professional practice attributes. Yet the scope of the mechanical engineering profession is broad and views of practitioners contributing to debate on attribute requirements are largely influenced by their own often unique professional formation. In addition, the formative development of the profession in Australia has been significantly influenced by 19 th and 20 th century UK and US practices, although historically the industrial profile of Australia has been strikingly different. An analysis of current industry distribution of Australian, UK and US mechanical engineers presented in this paper shows continuing, although less marked, differences. To develop a clearer perception of the profession in Australia, its educational formation, and operational environment, this paper provides a concise study of the formative development of the profession, and presents a breakdown of the industry sectors in which they are currently employed. The effects of momentous global changes in engineering employment and formation over recent decades are also discussed. Recent changes in engineering employment have included major structural <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>organisations,</b> accelerating technical and educational developments and mounting societal expectations making it imperative that attributes be attuned to the new engineering paradigm as increasing demands are placed on our graduates. This paper provides an essential foundation for ongoing debate and analysis of attribute needs related to this broadly based engineering discipline. Although presented from an Australian perspective, many issues discussed are applicable worldwide. <br /...|$|E
40|$|From the introduction]. Like (and {{perhaps even}} more than) other {{institutions}} of the European Union (EU), also the EP is exposed to robust pressures as the EU expands its membership to 25, soon 27 states. Hix, Noury and Roland (2007, p. 285) are explicit on this point: the EP ‘has {{the potential to be}} the most fragmented parliament in the world’. The enlargement certainly does not alleviate this condition nor diminishes the potential. Identifying the pressures at stake and detecting their repercussions can be, for several reasons, both problematic and fascinating. On the one hand, the conceptualisation of the enlargement as an independent variable determining fundamental <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>organisations</b> confronts scholars with several and severe methodological puzzles. On the other hand, phrasing a research question {{in terms of what the}} expansion of the EU does to its institutions, policies, values and norms is a legitimate and to a certain extent inevitable choice: depending on the answers one obtains, the assessment of past enlargements can be properly undertaken, the viability of future enlargements can be more easily predicted and the sustainability of the current settings can be more precisely determined. The risky side of this exercise includes many dimensions: first, the enlargement acts on the EU in conjunction with many other forces whose impact can hardly be separated from the fact that more Member States (MSs) join the EU. In many cases, for example, treaty changes are adopted in the perspective of an enlargement, which in itself alters the basis for comparison: the Union in which one pretends to ‘measure’ the change brought about by the enlargement is often very different from the one taken as a point of reference, before the enlargement took place. Second, the impact of the enlargement can hardly be conceived as a homogeneous phenomenon, given that the pressures it can exert vary greatly across institutions, policy areas, and other dimensions, and that the change these pressures can foster depends very much on the predisposition for change of the institution, the organisation or the actor that ‘receives’ it (horizontal complexity). Third, even when one identifies a specific target to detect change, it is not obvious nor always possible to trace a single or a consistent pattern of change: in the case of an institution of the EU, for example, it may well be that the enlargement alters profoundly some aspects of its organisation, but does not affect at all its contribution to the legislative process (vertical complexity). As the enlargement can impact with varying intensity on different dimensions, one needs to be explicit about the specific aspects that are targeted by the research and prudent on the conclusions that can be drawn...|$|E

40|$|Between 1980 and 1998, the {{proportion}} of British employees who were union members fell from around 52 per cent to around 30 per cent. Was this decline in trade union membership mainly 'structurally determined' by <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> the economic, political and social environment, or was union failure {{a large part of}} the reason for union decline? If structural determinants were of more importance, what was the relative importance of economic and business cycle factors compared to legal and political <b>changes,</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> employee attitudes and values and secular <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> economic <b>organisation?</b> This thesis seeks to answer these questions in the light of detailed econometric analysis of the micro-level processes of declining union density at the workplace level (using data from the Workplace Industrial/Employee Relations Surveys) and the individual level (using data from the British Household Panel Survey). The central argument is that environmental changes provide a more compelling explanation for union decline than explanations based on union failure. There is little evidence that changing employee attitudes and values or legal changes or the business cycle directly caused decline. Instead, secular <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> economic <b>organisation</b> which <b>changed</b> the balance of incentives associated with unionisation for firms, organisations and workers seem the most likely cause of declining union membership density. The scale and magnitude of these changes can be attributed to Government polic...|$|R
