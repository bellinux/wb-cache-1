We show theoretically that relaxing ownership controls and improving contract enforcement can induce multinational companies to expand product varieties to host developing countries, and that {{a combination of the two}} reforms has an amplifying effect on product transfers. Consistent with these implications, we find that ownership liberalization and judicial quality played an important role in raising the extensive margin of processing exports in China for the period of 1997 - 2007.

40|$|Zafar Iqbal Background Despite {{increasing}} evidence indicating that wearing cycle helmets {{can reduce the}} severity of head injuries, particularly in children, there is a paucity of local data on <b>cycle</b> helmet <b>ownership</b> and wearing rates. These data together {{with an understanding of}} the factors which influence these rates are important in developing appro-priate health promotion programmes. Method The objectives were to (1) establish patterns of <b>cycle</b> helmet <b>ownership</b> and wearing rates, and (2) determine factors influencing these rates. A descriptive survey involv-ing a self-completed questionnaire was undertaken and a series of focus groups were also established. The setting was two high schools and four primary schools in each of the six boroughs or district councils within South Staffordshire involving 932 Year 6 and 2005 Year 10 children. Results The response ratio was 70. 9 per cent from Year 6 and 80. 9 per cent from Year 10, giving an overall response rate of 77. 8 per cent. Most children (86. 6 per cent) rode a bicycle and of these 42. 8 per cent owned a cycle helmet. Just over a third (36. 8 per cent) of Year 6 cyclists wore a helmet always or nearly always, compared with 13. 7 per cent of Year 10 cyclists. Although the protective effect of cycle helmets was appreciated, many children did not see themselves as being personally at risk, particularly on short journeys. The appearance and comfort of the helmet appeared to be stronger factors influencing the uptake of helmets compared with cost. Both year groups were similarly concerned with comfort, but Year 10 children appeared more concerned with appearance than Year 6 children. Conclusions <b>Cycle</b> helmet <b>ownership</b> and wearing is still disappointingly low, especially amongst older children. The factors influencing patterns of ownership and wearing are numerous and the interrelationships between them are complex, requiring a co-ordinated approach from a range of agencies.

40|$|Cycling is {{considered}} an environmentally-friendly mode of transport that offers many personal benefits including health, affordability and flexibility of travel. To encourage more people to cycle, especially in contexts where <b>cycle</b> <b>ownership</b> and ridership is considerably low, requires understanding the underlying motivations and barriers to cycling. This study models the behavioural influences of individuals’ (N[*]=[*] 348) intended adoption of cycling {{to work in the}} Kumasi metropolis in Ghana, West Africa. It deploys the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to explore the extent to which socio-psychological constructs namely; Attitude, perceived behavioural (PBC) and subjective norm (SN) influence intended adoption of cycling as work travel mode. The influence of participants’ perception of their physical environment as well as their personal characteristics, cycling history and bicycle ownership are also examined. Results of an SEM analysis showed that among the TPB constructs, PBC (i. e. perception of self-confidence, personal control and ease of cycling) had the strongest positive and direct effect on participants’ intention to cycle to work. Negative associations were found between attitude and SN and SN and PBC, suggesting that belief about the prestige of cycling relative to other modes, and approval of society and significant others of cycling, influenced perception of control and confidence as well as attitude with respect to cycling. Also, participants’ perception of their environment including traffic-lights, traffic volume and congestion, as well as bicycle ownership and frequency of use, increased intended adoption of cycling. Finally, being female decreased the likelihood of intended cycling adoption. Cycling promotion interventions could be anchored on people’s already strong perceived control and confidence to cycle while addressing negative perceptions and attitudes towards cycling as a mainstream transport mode...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the interactions between}} firms’ financial policies and expected business cycles, in listed firms, in Europe, and over 20 years. We show that these interactions are mediated by ownership structures. Firms with strongly concentrated ownership, or under control, lead contra-cyclical policies, while firms with dispersed ownership lead somewhat pro-cyclical policies, supporting the traditional expectation that business cycles are of little direct relevance for financial policies. Our theoretical considerations unfold from the idea that ownership dispersion implies a different mix in agency relations in the firm. It entails specificities in agency costs, opportunity benefits of managerial discretion, it fosters differing needs for disciplining through debt, different needs for signaling, and potentially different market timing behaviors by managers and incumbent shareholders. As a result different objectives and constraints foster different policies: firms with dispersed ownership conduct lean (i. e. procyclical) policies, while firms with concentrated ownership or under control favor some financial smoothing (i. e. contra-cyclical policies). We derive from these two propositions specific hypotheses about public debt issuance, private debt management, investment, dividend and cash-holding policies, as well as resulting changes in financial leverage. Evidence is mostly supportive of our hypothesizing and propositions. Our proceedings are largely exploratory and our potential contribution extends to a number adjacent research questions including, among others, the analysis of performance effects of ownership concentration, the relative assessment of governance mechanisms, or still the investigation, in capital structure studies, of specific managerial behaviors and managerspecific information. Overall our emphasis on the potential relevance of business cycles for firm’s financial policies comes timely following the recent financial turmoil.

40|$|We {{begin by}} {{identifying}} a typical governance life-cycle, defined as changes in ownership structure, and including both {{the identity of}} the major owner and <b>ownership</b> concentration.

The governance cycle for transitional countries reflects some specific characteristics –e. g. often privatization produces specific initial ownership structures, with an unusually high proportion of insider, especially, employee ownership. Subsequently pres-sures for restructuring produce strong impulses for ownership changes. There is limited possibility for external finance because of the embryonic development of the banking system and the capital markets during early transition. The governance cycle is also influenced by specific features of the institutional, cultural and economic environment in a country. The varying importance of these fac-tors is expected to produce differences in key features of <b>ownership</b> <b>cycles</b> such as the speed at which particular ownership changes occur. To provide simple hypothesis tests, we use new and rich enterprise panel data sets for the three Bal-tic countries. The data enable various measures of ownership to be constructed (including the iden-tity of major owners and ownership concentration). The empirical analysis covers the <b>ownership</b> <b>cycle</b> with emphasis on initial ownership and subsequent changes. Our key method is to assemble a series of transition matrices showing both starting and final ownership configurations for sample enterprises and to simultaneously provide information on changes in concentration for the largest single owner. For Estonia this is supplemented with an analysis of the frequencies of different own-ership-cycles including intermediary stages of ownership. In spite of important differences in insti-tutional development, especially concerning the privatization process, we find that governance cy-cles are broadly similar in all countries. Employee ownership is rapidly fading and mainly being succeeded by managerial ownership. There are changes back and forth between manager and do-mestic external ownership, while foreign ownership is quite stable. Ownership concentration is mostly increasing after privatization, which included diversification both to employees and external owners. Since ownership diversification did not sit well with the slow development of the institu-tional framework, as expected we see a subsequent concentration of ownership on both managers, external domestic and foreign owners. However, variation in institutions, there are also important differences across countries. The adjustment of ownership structures is faster in Estonia and this {{can be explained by the}} relatively fast pace of institutional change and evolution of important gov-ernance institutions, including tough bankruptcy legislation and advances in the financial system.

Detailed heliostat cost breakdown is organized into three categories to reflect the costs as seen in a real life project. The three categories (Component, Installation/checkout and Operations/maintenance costs) are then summed to calculate the life <b>cycle</b> cost of <b>ownership</b> for different size heliostats [1].

40|$|Retained {{ownership}} is a marketing strategy that involves maintaining ownership of young cattle beyond calf weaning, a traditional marketing time for many producers. Numerous retained ownership strategies exist. It {{is extremely important}} for producers and their lenders to clearly understand {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of a specific retained ownership strategy in order to fully evaluate profit potential. The advantages and disadvantages of retained ownership have been discussed by several authors. Advantages include 1) compensation for superior genetics, 2) reduction in market inefficiencies, 3) increased quality control in beef, 4) reduction in market risk for frost or drought damaged crops and 5) reduction in profitability peaks and valleys associated with cattle <b>cycles.</b> Retained <b>ownership</b> of cattle is not without problems. Disadvantages include 1) increased risk of poor performance due to poor genetics, health problems or deteriorating environmental conditions, 2) increased market risk, 3) increased financing requirements and 4) potential tax problems. Nearly every economic analysis of retained ownership has shown an increase in profitability over traditional cow-calf operations. Data adapted from the Kansas Steer Futurity (Simms and Maddux, 1990) are displayed in Table 1. Average annual net returns per cow through weaning were $ 4. 84 from 1974 - 1988. Negative returns averaging -$ 43. 81 were observed for 8 of the 14 years. Average annual returns per cow for the feedlot phase of production were $ 27. 13. Negative returns averaging -$ 35. 56 were observed in 5 of the 14 years. Returns for the combined cow-calf and feedlot phases of production averaged $ 31. 97. This represents a 6. 6 -fold increase in profitability as compared to marketing the calf crop at weaning. Losses averaging -$ 40. 69 were observed in 6 of the 14 years. A 1990 - 91 South Dakota Retained Ownership Demonstration Program (Wagner et al., 1991) showed average profits of $ 38. 75 and $ 16. 69 for an accelerated finishing program and a traditional two-phased growing and finishing program, respectively. The variability in profitability between groups of cattle representing different genetic and management backgrounds was tremendous.

Key elements of successful new product development (NPD) are identified from the literature, including strategic fit, organizational structure, financial considerations, and use of Stage-GateTM type processes. Constraints, conflicts, and issues which arise in the defense contract funded R&D world but not in the commercial world are explored, including a multiplicity of funding sources, short funding <b>cycles,</b> and ambiguous <b>ownership</b> of go/kill decisions and gating criteria. Existing defense industry Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and new Engineering and Manufacturing Readiness Level (EMRL) and Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) metrics are evaluated as potential gating mechanisms relevant to the defense industry. We determine that the EMRL and MRL metrics meet many of the criteria necessary for good NPD gates, but they must still be supplemented by commercial best practices such as ensuring strategic fit, good organizational structure, financial attractiveness and competitive evaluation. (cont.) A resulting combined framework of "soft" and "hard" criteria is applied to a case study of an optical component currently under development with contract R&D dollars. The output of this study helped to shape strategic decisions regarding this component and to identify next steps in the technology maturation roadmap.

40|$|RAM {{analysis}} {{is used to}} assess system availability in {{the oil and gas}} industry. As the concept design for reliability is getting attention throughout various industries, RAM analysis has become a mandatory delivery in the conceptual design phase. LCC analysis aims at predicting acquisition cost and ownership cost during the project life <b>cycle.</b> Since the <b>ownership</b> cost is derived from operation and maintenance, which can be potentially much higher than the acquisition cost, so that quantifying the ownership cost is the main objective of a LCC analysis. Combing RAM and LCC analyses in the conceptual design phase helps the trade-off between maximizing regularity and minimizing expenditure before entering into the detailed engineering phase. However, the conceptual design phase is rather short, and therefore a simple model is a key to the feasibility of performing the two analyses. An ongoing project from Aker Solutions has been carried out in this thesis as a case study to perform both RAM and LCC analyses. The analytical and the simulation approaches are the two common approaches to RAM analysis. In general, the analytical approach is rigid by using predefined formulas. It may be easy to apply in the conceptual design phase, but rather weak at handling large and complex systems. In contrary, the simulation approach is more flexible and capable. By simulating, more detailed and accurate results can be generated. Several software tools have been developed for both approaches. They are briefly discussed with pros and cons. Rather than saying one tool is superior to the other, {{it is more important to}} know which tool to use in the specific application. Since Aker Solutions has close cooperation with Statoil, Miriam Regina is used in Aker Solutions to perform the simulation approach. A number of LCC-related standards have been developed. Although many theoretical issues have been discussed, a complete LCC {{analysis is}} hardly found in the literatures. This may be due to confidential issues, lack of practical guidance and knowledge limitation in the project's early phase. Considering the variance of different projects, it is somehow unrealistic to develop a universal method for LCC analysis. In this thesis, a six steps procedure is illustrated with explanation of each step. Based on the NORSOK standards, an Excel spreadsheet is established, and demonstrated in the case study. Sensitivity analysis offers the possibility of comparing alternative solutions. By incorporating sensitivity analysis into RAM and LCC analyses, the alternative solutions are examined related to both regularity and cost dimensions. Usually, in the conceptual design phase, the sensitivity analysis is used to reveal the impact of changes in the component configuration or process design, which in turn guide system optimization. Uncertainties are found in three areas, parameter, model and completeness. It is however impossible to quantify uncertainties. In order to reduce uncertainties, it is important to obtain reliable data, use appropriate model, and document assumptions. In the case study, by using Miriam Regina, RAM analysis provides the production availability and ranks the subsystems/components according their criticality. LCC analysis is applied with the Excel spreadsheet, which calculates the acquisition cost and the ownership cost for the proposed options. Through the case study, the feasibility of performing RAM and LCC analyses in the conceptual design phase has been proved. </p...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} value perceptions and consumption behaviors of sneakerheads who are mixed-role resellers of sneakers. “Sneakerhead” is a term given to those who collect and wear sneakers with a vast amount of effort and resources (Semmelhack, Garcia, Lepri, Willis, & Hatfield, 2015). “Mixed-role resellers” is a term given to individuals who collect, use, and resell consumer goods (Chu & Liao, 2007). Traditional consumer behavior frameworks mostly focus on behaviors surrounding pre-acquisition, purchase, and use of goods initially purchased by the consumer for his or her own use (Boyd & McConocha, 1996). These frameworks do not necessarily explain behaviors surrounding goods initially purchased with the intention to resell to others, such as researching predicted resale value during pre-acquisition, using controversial methods to obtain products during acquisition, and taking special measure to keep a product in pristine condition. While the resale market has expanded due to internet and social media, resale behavior has not drawn much attention from researchers. To address this gap, the author took a qualitative approach to gain an understanding of value perception and behaviors when consumers purchase goods with the intention to resell. The three research questions are: 1) 	What factors into mixed-role reseller sneakerheads’ perception of a sneaker’s value? 2) 	What behaviors are exhibited by mixed-role reseller sneakerheads during pre-acquisition, acquisition, physical possession, and resale of the sneakers they intend to resell; what motivates these behaviors? 3) 	What do mixed-role reseller sneakerheads like and dislike about the sneaker resale market? A total of 25 in-depth interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide. Interviewees were recruited through posts on sneakerhead community websites and snowball sampling. To qualify for participation in the study, interviewees needed to fit the description of a sneakerhead and a mixed-role reseller of sneakers. Results show how the interviewees evaluate the value of sneakers they intend to resell, what behaviors interviewees exhibit during the pre-acquisition, acquisition, physical possession, and disposition stages pertaining to sneakers they intend to resell, and how the interviewees felt about the resale market in general. First, data show that sneakers can hold monetary, emotional, functional, and/or social value. Most discussion about sneaker value centered on monetary value. Findings show that interviewees’ perceptions of monetary value were influenced by sneaker model rarity, celebrity endorsement of sneakers, collaboration between brands and celebrities, retro marketing, and sneaker condition. Second, the interviewees who purchased sneakers with resale intention demonstrated behaviors that are noteworthy in various stages of the Inventory <b>Ownership</b> <b>Cycle</b> (IOC) (Boyd & McConocha, 1996). When interviewees considered purchasing sneakers they intended to resale, they did an extensive information search prior to purchase to predict resale price, purchased multiple pairs with controversial methods (e. g., using bots and back-dooring), did not wear or carefully wore the sneakers, utilized various resale channel (e. g., eBay, social media, and mobile applications), and took measures to minimize physical and financial risks of reselling. Third, data show that while interviewees often had both positive and negative affects towards the resale market, they tended to have more negative affects towards resellers who used controversial methods to acquire sneakers. However, the interviewees seemed to accept these negative aspects of the resale market and said nothing can be done to change it. This study has implications for both researchers and business practitioners. For researchers in consumer behavior, this study provides insight into how resale intention can influence behaviors throughout the IOC (Boyd & McConocha, 1996). For business practitioners, findings from this study call attention to the need to consider consumers who purchase for personal use and consumers who purchase for resale as different market segments. It also calls out the need for brand managers to preserve this unique consumer culture and reduce negative outcomes caused by reselling...|$|R
