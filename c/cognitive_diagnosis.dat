40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} <b>cognitive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> as an instance of general diagnosis, as studied in artificial intelligence. <b>Cognitive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> {{is the process of}} inferring a cognitive state from observations of performance. It is thus a key component of any system which attempts to build a dynamic model of the user of that system. Many issues in <b>cognitive</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> previously discussed informally, are mapped onto formal techniques, with consequent increased clarity and rigour. But it is concluded that the `general' theories for diagnosis must be broadened to fully encompass the problems of <b>cognitive</b> <b>diagnosis.</b> Key words: student modelling; diagnosis; fault models; hierarchical abstraction; default reasoning 1. Introduction <b>Cognitive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> is "the process of inferring a person's cognitive state from his or her performance" (Ohlsson, 1986) and, as such, is a central activity in any system which aims to build a dynamic model of the user of that system.

40|$|<b>Cognitive</b> <b>Diagnosis</b> Models (CDMs) {{are useful}} {{statistical}} tools in <b>cognitive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> assessment.

This work gives the sufficient and necessary condition for the identifiability of the basic DINA model, which not only addresses the open problem in Xu and Zhang (2016, Psychomatrika, 81 : 625 - 649) on the minimal requirement for the identifiability, but also sheds light {{on the study of}} more general CDMs, which often cover the DINA as a submodel. Moreover, we show the identifiability condition ensures the consistent estimation of the model parameters.

40|$|<b>Cognitive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> models (CDMs) {{continue}} to generate interest among researchers and practitioners {{because they can}} provide diagnostic information relevant to classroom instruction and student learning. However, its modeling component has outpaced its complementary component-test construction. Thus, most applications of <b>cognitive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> modeling involve retrofitting of CDMs to assessments constructed using classical test theory (CTT) or item response theory (IRT). This study explores the relationship between item statistics used in the CTT, IRT, and CDM frameworks using such an assessment, specifically a large-scale mathematics assessment. Furthermore, by highlighting differences between tests with varying levels of diagnosticity using a measure of item discrimination from a CDM approach, this study empirically uncovers some important CTT and IRT item characteristics.

40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} {{in recent years in}} using <b>cognitive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> models for diagnostic measurement, i. e., classification according to multiple discrete latent traits. The Q-matrix, an incidence matrix specifying {{the presence or absence of}} a relationship between each item in the assessment and each latent attribute, is central to many of these models. Important applications include educational and psychological testing; demand in education, for example, has been driven by recent focus on skills-based evaluation. However, compared to more traditional models coming from classical test theory and item response theory, <b>cognitive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> models are relatively undeveloped and suffer from several issues limiting their applicability. This thesis exams several issues related to statistical inference and experimental design for Q-matrix based <b>cognitive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> models. We begin by considering one of the main statistical issues affecting the practical use of Q-matrix based <b>cognitive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> models, the identifiability issue. In statistical models, identifiability is prerequisite for most common statistical inferences, including parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. With Q-matrix based <b>cognitive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> models, identifiability also affects the classification of respondents according to their latent traits. We begin by examining the identifiability of model parameters, presenting necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiability in several settings. Depending on the area of application and the researcher's degree of control over the experiment design, fulfilling these identifiability conditions may be difficult. The second part of this thesis proposes new methods for parameter estimation and respondent classification for use with non-identifiable models. In addition, our framework allows consistent estimation of the severity of the non-identifiability problem, in terms of the proportion of the population affected by it. The implications of this measure for the design of diagnostic assessments are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cognitive</b> fault <b>diagnosis</b> systems {{differentiate}} from more traditional solutions by providing online strategies {{to create and}} update the fault-free and the faulty classes directly from incoming data. This aspect is of paramount relevance within the big data framework, since measurements are there immediately processed to detect and identify the upsurge of potential faults. This paper introduces a novel <b>cognitive</b> fault <b>diagnosis</b> framework for processes described by nonlinear dynamic systems that inspects changes in the existing relationships among sensors. The proposed framework {{is based on an}} evolving clustering algorithm that operates in the parameter space of time invariant linear models approximating such relationships.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to design and develop a <b>cognitive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> system for {{intelligent}} tutoring. The <b>cognitive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> system proposed in this dissertation is called PSCD (Production System for <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Diagnosis).</b> PSCD is intended for intelligent tutoring with possible relevance to decision aiding. ^ This dissertation is based on two assumptions. First, it is assumed that perspectives and methodologies of cognitive science provide a starting point for integrating decision-making studies and cognitive studies (Simon, 1979). Second it is assumed that integrating theories and building an integrated theory or theories into a cognitive architecture provide opportunities to realize practical applications (Newell, 1990). Basing on these two assumptions, the study attempts to integrate three theories of human information processing and to build the integrated theory into PSCD. ^ Three theories considered in this study are heuristic search, production systems architecture, and constructivism. These three theories act as constraints in setting the design specification of PSCD in the huge space of alternative designs. PSCD that are developed henceforth is applied to a counting task for initial validation, and to a transportation problem solving task which is the main task of this dissertation. ...|$|E

In recent years a number of <b>cognitive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> models have become a popular means of estimating student skill knowledge.

40|$|Abstract — The {{emergence}} of large sensor networks has facili-tated {{the collection of}} large amounts of real-time data to monitor and control complex engineering systems. However, {{in many cases the}} collected data may be incomplete or inconsistent, while the underlying environment may be time-varying or unformulated. In this paper, we develop an innovative <b>cognitive</b> fault <b>diagnosis</b> framework that tackles the above challenges. This framework investigates fault diagnosis in the model space instead of the signal space. Learning in the model space is implemented by fitting a series of models using a series of signal segments selected with a sliding window. By investigating the learning techniques in the fitted model space, faulty models can be discriminated from healthy models using a one-class learning algorithm. The framework enables us to construct a fault library when unknown faults occur, which can be regarded as cognitive fault isolation. This paper also theoretically investigates how to measure the pairwise distance between two models in the model space and incorporates the model distance into the learning algorithm in the model space. The results on three benchmark applications and one simulated model for the Barcelona water distribution network confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

40|$|The use of <b>cognitive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> models (CDMs) and {{computerized}} adaptive testing (CAT) {{has been}} increasing in both education and other fields such as psychology.

The use of <b>cognitive</b> <b>diagnosis</b> computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) can produce more diagnostic information with an efficient testing design. This paper aims to investigate the impact of attribute size on the performance of item selection indices in terms of average test lengths.
