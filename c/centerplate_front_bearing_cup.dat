40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} focused on the {{theoretical}} modeling and numerical investigation about the dynamic and static stiffness of coupled double-rotor spindle system of high speed grinder. The moment balance and the transition matrix, the state vector, field matrix of spindle system of high speed grinder were analyzed and deduced. The theoretical models about dynamic and static stiffness were established using the transfer matrix method. The numerical results showed that increased rigidity of <b>front</b> <b>bearing</b> significantly increased static and dynamic rigidity of spindle end and the rigidity of <b>front</b> <b>bearing</b> increased, dynamic rigidity increased more significantly than static rigidity. Furthermore, it can be conclued that increased overhang length reduced dynamic and static rigidity of spindle end at an increasingly slower rate and the span of bearing increased, static and dynamic rigidities of spindle end were reduced...|$|R

30|$|The spindle is {{the core}} {{component}} with complex assembly mechanical structure in heavy-duty CNC machine tool. The spindle consists of the rotating shaft, the <b>front</b> and rear <b>bearings,</b> and the spindle base. For the motorized spindle, it also includes the rotor and stator. As {{the structure of the}} spindle is very compact and narrow, to fix the temperature sensor inside the spindle is difficult.

50|$|The headset is {{the set of}} {{components}} on a bicycle that provides a rotatable interface between the bicycle fork and the head tube of the bicycle frame. The tube through which the steerer of the fork passes is called the head tube. A typical headset consists of two cups that are pressed into {{the top and bottom}} of the headtube. Inside the two <b>cups</b> are <b>bearings</b> which provide a low friction contact between the <b>bearing</b> <b>cup</b> and the steerer.|$|R
50|$|The Bayliss-Wiley Unit Bottom Bracket was {{introduced}} in the mid-1940s. It was fitted to various English lightweights through the 1950s and was used by Royal Enfield on its 'Revelation' small wheeler in the mid-1960s. However, the unit bottom bracket was never popular and it had a reputation for being troublesome. A lack of positive location allowed it to rotate within the frame, loosening the <b>bearing</b> <b>cups.</b> Contemporary users overcome the problem by fixing the unit in the frame using adhesive or a screw.|$|R

40|$|Investigation {{showed that}} the turbine <b>front</b> <b>bearing</b> has failed by true {{brinelling}} followed by severe spalling on the inner raceway. The most probable reason for such failure appears to be excessive load on the balls arising from the misalignment of the bearing. The cause for the misalignment is uncertain {{and needs to be}} determined to prevent recurrence of similar failure. The microstructure and hardness of outer/inner ring and the balls were found to be in the normal range of high carbon bearing steel. There were no damages in the turbine rear bearing. ...|$|R

40|$|The need to {{understand}} and quantify the heat transfer paths within tapered-roller bearings is of great importance in the railroad industry since <b>bearing</b> <b>cup</b> temperature measurement is the primary tool utilized in the removal of distressed bearings from service.

5000|$|The early {{engines that}} were {{produced}} before 1957 had a light alloy piston rod which is retained in its socket by a slotted steel retaining cup {{which in turn}} is held in place by a steel circlip located in a shallow groove in the interior piston wall. This arrangement (known as a three-piece piston) was abandoned as of 1957 in favour of a hardened steel rod which was swaged into a <b>bearing</b> <b>cup</b> formed integrally in the piston interior. The advantage of this latter set-up was that it simplified assembly and the bearing could be re-set to take up play using a suitable [...] "reset" [...] tool to re-swage the cup.|$|R
