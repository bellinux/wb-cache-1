50|$|In {{physics and}} engineering, a phasor (a {{portmanteau}} of phase vector), {{is a complex}} number representing a sinusoidal function whose amplitude (A), angular frequency (ω), and initial phase (θ) are time-invariant. It is related to a more general concept called analytic representation, which decomposes a sinusoid into {{the product of a}} complex constant and a factor that encapsulates the frequency and time dependence. The complex constant, which encapsulates amplitude and phase dependence, is known as phasor, complex amplitude, and (in older texts) sinor or even <b>complexor.</b>|$|E
40|$|Connectivity, {{the control}} {{parameter}} in a nonlinear dynamics model of team performance is mathematically {{linked to the}} ratio of positivity to negativity (P/N) in team interaction. By knowing the P/N ratio {{it is possible to}} run the nonlinear dynamics model that will portray what types of dynamics are possible for a team. These dynamics are of three types: point attractor, limit cycle, and <b>complexor</b> (complex order, or “chaotic ” in the mathematical sense). Low performance teams end up in point attractor dynamics, medium perfomance teams in limit cycle dynamics, and high performance teams in <b>complexor</b> dynamics. Keywords: positivity; connectivity; team performance; nonlinear dynamics Positive organizational scholars have made an explicit call for the use of nonlinear models stating that their field “is especially interested in the nonlinear positive dynamics [...] . that are frequently associated with positive organizational phenomena ” (Cameron, Dutton, & Quinn, 2003, pp. 4 - 5). This article answers this call by showing how a nonlinear dynamics model, the meta learning (ML) model, developed and validated against empirical time series data of busines...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study on}} the solubility and aggregation properties of humic and fulvic acids, and their interaction with hydrophobic metal complexes and with aqueous metal ions. A parallel study involved quantitative analysis of solution equilibria between Al(III), Cu(II) and simple ligand systems representing possible complexing moieties in humic substances. The solubility and aggregation properties of humic acid were studied as a function of pH and ionic strength by gel permeation chromatography and equilibrium dialysis. Predominantly smaller molecules were dissolved below pH 4; the solubility of the larger humic molecules increased with increased pH and with decreased ionic strength. The potential of XAD resins for the isolation of humic acid from soil extracts was investigated. These macroporous adsorbents were found to be unsuitable for this purpose. Large molecules were excluded from the XAD resins; those components which were adsorbed could not be completely desorbed by strongly alkaline solutions. In conjunction with the solubility studies these results highlighted the operational nature of the fraction defined as 'humic acid' and raised questions about the reported differences between aquatic and soil derived humic substances. The interaction of humic substances with hydrophobic Cu(II) complexes (L = 1 -(2 -pyridylazo) - 2 -naphthol and 8 -hydroxyquinoline) was studied by ASV (at a NCTMFE) and by visible absorption spectroscopy. Humic substances (HS) interacted hydrophilically with these species (if necessary displacing a low molecular weight ligand) to form a ternary complex, HS-Cu-L. Algal assays established that humic acid could thus ameliorate the extreme toxicity of hydrophobic Cu(II) complexes provided that the displaced ligand itself is not toxic. The apparent lability of Cu(II) and Pb(II) complexes with humic and fulvic acids was studied by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). At a hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE) the Cu(II) complexes of humic and fulvic acids were of similar lability; the apparent lability decreased as the pH increased. Complexes of humic substances with Cu(II) were less labile than those with Pb(II). Results were dependent on the electrode system used for the measurements. The effects of adsorption of humic substances on several electrode surfaces were characterized (HMDE, thin mercury film (TMFE), Nafion-coated TMFE, and bare glassy carbon). These effects were exerted predominantly in the deposition step. A method for measuring the apparent lability of metal-humic complexes was developed which corrected for the contribution from adsorption. Ion selective electrode (ISE) potentiometry was used to probe the complexation capacity of humic and fulvic acids for Cu(II) (at pH 5. 0, 6. 3, and 7. 0) and the relative stability of these complexes (pH 2. 5 - 7. 5). For both humic substances the complexation capacity increased with pH. Assuming bidentate coordination then, for fulvic acid at pH 5. 0, 6. 3, and 7. 0 respectively, complexation capacity measurements indicated that 82 - 85 %, 67 - 72 %, and 50 - 60 % of carboxyl groups were not involved in strong Cu(II) binding under the experimental conditions. For humic acid the proportions were 73 - 79 %, 33 - 43 % and 5 - 25 % respectively. Cu(II) complexes with fulvic acid were significantly less stable than those with humic acid. At the same carboxyl group concentration, Cu(II) binding curves for humic acid were displaced markedly to lower pH, indicating stronger binding. For a 1 : 20 Cu(II) :COOH ratio the pH displacement between the humic and fulvic acid curves was 0. 65 at pH 3. 5 and 1. 0 at pH 5. 0. The larger humic acid molecules (fractionated by 0. 025 μm filtration in weakly acidic solution) were stronger <b>complexors</b> than were the smaller moieties. The apparent stability of Cu(II) -humic complexes decreased with increased metal-to-ligand ratio and with increased ionic strength. The competition of Mg(II) and Al(III) for humic Cu(II) complexation sites was studied. Simulation of the Cu(II) binding curves for humic substances identified the discrete ligands malonate and citrate as reasonable models for humic chelating sites; complexation by salicylate and phthalate moieties was considerably weaker than that by humic substances. Quantitative pH potentiometric studies were made on the complexation of Cu(II) and Al(III) by carboxylate ligands (25 °C, 0. 1 mol L- 1 KCl). The models which best described the solution equilibria in the Al(III) systems were: Al(III) -malonic acid: AlL (log K = 6. 71), AlL 2 (4. 94), AlL 3 (2. 61), AlL 20 H (- 7. 0) Al(III) -isocitric acid: AlHL (10. 07), AlL (6. 96) The Cu(II) - 5 -methoxy-N-(2 -hydroxybenzyl) sarcosine system (CuL (7. 05), CuLH. 1 (- 3. 98)) demonstrated the contribution of 'cascade binding' to metal complex stability. Formation of insoluble species in the Cu(II) -butane- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetracarboxylic acid system prevented quantitative analysis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} a case study, {{involving}} 24 students at the third semester of English Education Department who were taking a course of writing II in Slamet Riyadi Surakarta. The goals of the study are {{to find out how}} Whole Brain Writing Game (WBWG) stimulates the students to generate and to develop ideas writing process, to identify the constraints experienced by the students when writing and how they coped with those problems. Over six months of conducting the research; field notes, transcribed interviews, and responses from questionnaire served as the data. The results showed that the Whole Brain Writing Game (WBWG) stimulated the students to generate and to develop ideas writing process by conducting two parts: Complexors and Puzzles. Complexors gave the students hundreds of repetitions in basic writing skills. Puzzles guided the students through a set of writing patterns. When students were playing with Complexors, they worked in teams to orally create as many <b>Complexor</b> tasks as possible in a minute. Complexors are speed games designed to build oral fluency. Writing a topic sentence was enormously simplified because students could speak 20 topic sentences in a row. When students were playing with Puzzles they worked individually or in teams, completing prewriting and writing tasks. Using a set of writing rules, students completed ever more elaborate, and challenging, essay patterns. Keywords:Whole Brain Writing Game, Teaching Writing, Case Stud...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{characterize}} early {{features of}} lung cancers detected with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening. Materials and methods: Two radiologists reviewed prior LDCTs in 20 incident cancers diagnosed at annua lrepeat screening rounds and 83 benign nodules {{observed in the}} ITALUNG trial. Results: No abnormality was observed in 3 cancers. Focal abnormalities in prior LDCT were identifiedi n 17 (85 %) cancers (14 adenocarcinomas; 14 stage I). Initial abnormalities were intra-pulmonary in 10,sub pleural in 4 and perifissural in 3. Average mean diameter was 9 mm (range 4. 5 – 18 mm). Nine exhibitedsolid, 4 part-solid and 4 non-solid density. The margins were smooth and regular in 5 cases, lobulated in 6, irregular with spiculations in 3 and blurred in 3. Ten (59 %) initial focal abnormalities had a round oroval nodular shape, but 7 (41 %) had a non-nodular complex (n = 5) or “stripe-like” (n = 2) shape. Bronchus sign was observed in 3 cases and association with cystic airspace in 2 cases. Non-solid density, <b>complexor</b> “stripe-like” shape, bronchus sign and association with cystic airspace had a specificity higher than 90 %, but positive predictive value of every feature of incident lung cancers was low (range 10. 4 – 50 %). Conclusions: The vast majority of cancers diagnosed at annual repeat show corresponding focal lungabnormalities in prior LDCTs. Perifissural location and non-nodular shape do not exclude the possibilityof early lung cancer. Since specificity of the early features of incident lung cancer is incomplete and theirpositive predictive value is low, all focal pulmonary abnormalities detected in screened subjects shouldbe re-evaluated in subsequent LDCTs...|$|E
