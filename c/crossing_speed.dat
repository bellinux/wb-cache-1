40|$|Broad {{absorption}} lines (BALs) in quasar spectra are prominent signatures of high-velocity outflows, {{which might be}} present in all quasars and could be {{a major contributor to}} feedback to galaxy evolution. Studying the variability in these BALs allows us to further our understanding of the structure, evolution and basic physical properties of the outflows. This is the third paper in a series on a monitoring programme of 24 luminous BAL quasars at redshifts 1. 2 < z < 2. 9. We focus here on the time-scales of variability in C[*]iv λ 1549 BALs in our full multi-epoch sample, which covers time-scales from 0. 02 to 8. 7 [*]yr in the quasar rest frame. Our sample contains up to 13 epochs of data per quasar, with an average of seven epochs per quasar. We find that both the incidence and the amplitude of variability are greater across longer time-scales. Part of our monitoring programme specifically targeted half of these BAL quasars at rest-frame time-scales ≤ 2 months. This revealed variability down to the shortest time-scales we probe (8 – 10 [*]d). Observed variations in only portions of BAL troughs or in lines that are optically thick suggest {{that at least some of}} these changes are caused by clouds (or some type of outflow substructures) moving across our lines of sight. In this crossing cloud scenario, the variability times constrain both the <b>crossing</b> <b>speeds</b> and the absorber locations. Specific results also depend on the emission and absorption geometries. We consider a range of geometries and use Keplerian rotational speeds to derive a general relationship between the variability times, <b>crossing</b> <b>speeds</b> and outflow locations. Typical variability times of the order of ∼ 1 yr indicate <b>crossing</b> <b>speeds</b> of a few thousand km[*]s^(− 1) and radial distances ∼ 1 pc from the central black hole. However, the most rapid BAL changes occurring in 8 – 10 [*]d require <b>crossing</b> <b>speeds</b> of 17 000 – 84 000 [*]km[*]s^(− 1) and radial distances of only 0. 001 – 0. 02 pc. These speeds are similar to or greater than the observed radial outflow speeds, and the inferred locations are within the nominal radius of the broad emission-line region...|$|R

Twenty participants receiving rehabilitation following a recent stroke were tested on two occasions one month apart. Participants received usual care rehabilitation, including physiotherapy, between the tests. The main outcome measure was obstacle <b>crossing</b> <b>speed</b> as participants stepped over a 4 -cm high obstacle. Secondary measures were spatiotemporal variables. Data were collected via a three dimensional motion analysis system.

40|$|Broad {{absorption}} lines (BALs) in quasar spectra identify high velocity outflows that might exist in all quasars and {{could play a}} major role in feedback to galaxy evolution. The viability of BAL outflows as a feedback mechanism depends on their kinetic energies, as derived from the outflow velocities, column densities, and distances from the central quasar. We estimate these quantities for the quasar, Q 1413 + 1143 (redshift z_e = 2. 56), aided by the first detection of PV λλ 1118, 1128 BAL variability in a quasar. In particular, PV absorption at velocities where the CIV trough does not reach zero intensity implies that the CIV BAL is saturated and the absorber only partially covers the background continuum source (with characteristic size 22. 3 (cm^- 2). Variability in the PV and saturated CIV BALs strongly disfavors changes in the ionization as the cause of the BAL variability, but supports models with high-column density BAL clouds moving across our lines of sight. The observed variability time of 1. 6 yr in the quasar rest frame indicates <b>crossing</b> <b>speeds</b> > 750 km/s and a radial distance from the central black hole of < 3. 5 pc, if the <b>crossing</b> <b>speeds</b> are Keplerian. The total outflow mass is 4100 M_solar, the kinetic energy 4 x 10 ^ 54 erg, and the ratio of the outflow kinetic energy luminosity to the quasar bolometric luminosity is 0. 02 (at the minimum column density and maximum distance), which might be sufficient for important feedback to the quasar's host galaxy.
