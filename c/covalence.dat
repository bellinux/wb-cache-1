Let Γ be an infinite graph, let Π be a double ray in Γ, and let d and dΠ denote the distance functions in Γ and in Π, respectively. One calls Π a quasi-axis if lim inf d(x, y) /dΠ(x, y) > 0, where x and y are vertices of Π and dΠ(x, y) → ∞. An infinite, locally finite, almost 4 -connected, almost-transitive, 1 -ended graph is shown to be planar if and only if the complement of every quasi-axis has exactly two infinite components. Let Γ be locally finite, planar, 3 -connected, almost-transitive, and 1 -ended. It is shown that no proper planar embedding of Γ has an infinite face and hence its <b>covalences</b> are bounded. If Γ has bounded <b>covalences</b> and if Π is any double ray in Γ, it is shown that Γ − Π has at most two infinite components, at most one on each side of Π. If, moreover, Π is a quasi-axis, then Γ − Π is shown to have exactly two infinite components. With the aid of a result of Thomassen (1992), the above-stated characterization of infinite, locally finite, planar, 1 -ended graphs is then obtained...|$|R

5000|$|The Rutherford {{model of}} the nuclear atom (1911) showed that the {{exterior}} of an atom is occupied by electrons, which suggests that electrons {{are responsible for the}} interaction of atoms and the formation of chemical bonds. In 1916, Gilbert N. Lewis explained valence and chemical bonding in terms of a tendency of (main-group) atoms to achieve a stable octet of 8 valence-shell electrons. According to Lewis, covalent bonding leads to octets by the sharing of electrons, and ionic bonding leads to octets by the transfer of electrons from one atom to the other. The term <b>covalence</b> is attributed to Irving Langmuir, who stated in 1919 that [...] "the number of pairs of electrons which any given atom shares with the adjacent atoms is called the <b>covalence</b> of that atom". The prefix co- means [...] "together", so that a co-valent bond means that the atoms share a valence. Subsequent to that, it is now more common to speak of covalent bonds rather than [...] "valence", which has fallen out of use in higher-level work from the advances in the theory of chemical bonding, but it is still widely used in elementary studies, where it provides a heuristic introduction to the subject.|$|E

50|$|For {{a better}} {{understanding}} {{it is important to}} follow up on how the PJTE is related to intramolecular interactions. In other words, what is the physical driving force of the PJTE distortions (transformations) in terms of well-known electronic structure and bonding? The driving force of the PJTE is added (improved) covalence: the PJTE distortion takes place when it results in energy gain due to better <b>covalence</b> bonding between the atoms in the distorted configuration. Indeed, in the starting high-symmetry configuration the wavefunctions of the electronic states, ground and excited, are orthogonal by definition. By distortion their orthogonality is violated, and a nonzero overlap between them occurs. If for two near-neighbor atoms the ground state wavefunction pertains (mainly) to one of them, while the excited state wavefunction belongs (mainly) to the other one, the overlap by distortion adds covalency to the bonding between them, facilitating the distortion (Fig. 2).|$|E

Hence, there exist several redox reactions involving such compounds. This freedom allows numerous chemical steps with different entropy changes, and thus offer more odds to meet the criteria required for a thermochemical cycle (cf. Principles). Most of the first studies were performed in the USA, as an example at the Kentucky University for sulfide-bases cycles.

Li ion intercalation in 2 H-MoS 2 leads to two competing effects, i. e. the 2 H-to- 1 T transition due to the weakening of Mo-S p-d interaction and the D 6 h crystal field, and the charge-density-wave transition due to the Peierls instability in Li-intercalated 2 H phase. The stabilization of charge density wave in Li-intercalated MoS 2 originates from the enhanced electron correlation due to nearest-neighbor Mo-Mo d-d <b>covalence</b> interaction, conforming to the extended Hubbard model.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{of the formation of}} a complex between several planar terdentate nitrogen ligands and trivalent lanthanides (Ln(3 +)) in mixed MeOH-H 2 O solutions is studied and a model is proposed for the thermodynamic properties of the complexation reactions. The objective is not to cover all aspects of complexation between Ln(3 +) and planar terdendate nitrogen ligands, but rather to provide insight into the factors that govern the complexation mechanism. It is shown that the complexation of Ln(3 +) in solution with similar ligands does not follow the classical trends in change of thermodynamic properties across the Ln series, which have long been known. Ab initio calculations show that the stability of complexes increases with the increasing electron donor ability of the coordinating central nitrogen atom (N-c) of the ligand and the electron acceptor ability of the coordinating lateral ones (N-l). The effect of <b>covalence</b> for the stability of complexes is analysed. The complexes with high stability are characterised by distinct <b>covalence</b> of the bonds between Ln(3 +) and the lateral coordinating nitrogen atoms of the ligand. The thermodynamic properties of complexation of Ln(3 +) with 2, 6 -bis-(pyridin- 2 -yl) - 4 -amino- 1, 3, 5 -triazine (Adptz) and 2, 6 -bis-(1, 2, 4 -triazin-yl) -pyridine (Btp) are compared. The central ring is negatively charged in the Adptz ligand, but positive in Btp. The strong donor acceptor interaction and the net <b>covalence</b> result in an enthalpy {{mechanism of}} complexation of Ln(3 +) with Adptz. Owing to the repulsion between the cation and the central nitrogen atom in the [Ln(Btp) ](3 +) (solv) complexes, the cation is pushed away from the nitrogen cavity, the Ln-N-c interatomic distances become larger and the electron donor ability of N-c is weak.
