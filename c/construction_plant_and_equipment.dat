40|$|Abstract: As China's resource-based cities {{gradually}} {{towards the}} end of the resources exploitation and experienced an economy recession, a large number of those cities are facing the challenge of transformation. Resource-exhausted cities left us a lot of industrial heritages such as abandoned industrial <b>plants,</b> <b>constructions,</b> <b>equipments</b> <b>and</b> facilities and so on. How to protect and use them is a realistic problem we must face. With the rapid development of tourism and the increasing expansion of tourism demand, industrial heritage tourism gives us an idea of the transformation of resource-exhausted cities. This paper first analyzes the features and development trends of resource-exhausted cities, then sums up the definition and value of industrial heritage, explores the promoting function of industrial heritage tourism for the transformation of resource-exhausted cities and last tries to give us some development modes...|$|R
40|$|As {{in other}} {{developing}} countries construction industry in Sri-Lanka is weak. Although there are large number of small contractors throughout the country, their plight is not satisfactory compared to other grades. Though there are criticisms against them such as poor quality, failure to meet completion dates etc. there are several difficulties faced by the small scale contractors. Under this environment Department of Civil Engineering, University of Moratuwa felt the need of carrying out this type of survey to identify the real problems and make recommendations to solve their problems by relevant parties. Very recently even the ICTAD and ACCSL have identified the necessity of such a survey inorder to improve the plight of small scale contractors. They have organised some interviews with Road Maintenance Contractors and workshops for small scale contractors in few provinces up to now. Based on these work, author has done a comprehensive survey on small scale contractors involved in building industry. Contractors' views on problems they face were investigated under major areas such as Technical <b>and</b> Managerial; Financial; <b>Construction</b> <b>plant,</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> vehicles; Basic materials; Contract Administration; and finally the Social Aspect. This was done mainly through a detailed questionnaire survey supplemented by interviews and discussions. Con tractors' views on reasons for such problems, their suggestions for improvements and support they need from outside parties such as ICTAD, ACCSL, CHPB, Government policy making bodies etc. were also considered. In {{order to get the}} real picture, other parties such as clients, consultants, experts dealing with the small scale contractors were also interviewed and their ideas were incorporated. It was found that the most critical problem that the small scale contractors have is the payment delays by the client due to various reasons. Other important problems are inadequate work throughout the year, difficulties in obtaining bonds, guarantees and loans, and non-availability of building materials and increasing prices. Finally the recommendations were developed based on the questionnaire survey, interviews with selected contractors, clients, consultants and experts in this field. It must be pointed out that the development assistance to small scale contractors, and the resulting benefits entirely depends on the success of implementation of results of this type of surveys...|$|R

40|$|Many {{accidents}} occur world-wide {{in the use}} of <b>construction</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment,</b> {{and safety}} training is {{considered by many to be}} one of the best approaches to their prevention. However, current safety training methods/tools are unable to provide trainees with the hands-on practice needed. Game technology-based safety training platforms have the potential to overcome this problem in a virtual environment. One such platform is described in this paper - its characteristics are analysed and its possible contribution to safety training identified. This is developed and tested by means of a case study involving three major pieces of construction plant, which successfully demonstrates that the platform can improve the process and performance of the safety training involved in their operation. This research not only presents a new and useful solution to the safety training of construction operations, but illustrates the potential use of advanced technologies in solving construction industry problems in general.

40|$|The {{productivity}} and output levels of <b>construction</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> depends in part upon a plant operator’s maintenance proficiency; such that {{a higher degree}} of proficiency helps ensure that machinery is maintained in good operational order. In the absence of maintenance proficiency, the potential for machine breakdown (and hence lower productivity) is greater. Using data gathered from plant and equipment experts within the UK, plant operators’ maintenance proficiency are modelled using a radial basis function (RBF) artificial neural network (ANN). Results indicate that the developed ANN model was able to classify proficiency at 89 % accuracy using 10 significant variables. These variables were: working nightshifts, new mechanical innovations, extreme weather conditions, planning skills, operator finger dexterity, years experience with a plant item, working with managers with less knowledge of plant/equipment, operator training by apprenticeship, working under pressure of time and duration of training period. It is proffered that these variables may be used as a basis for categorizing plant operators in terms of maintenance proficiency and, that their potential for influencing operator training programmes needs to be considered...|$|E

Between 1951 and 1955 he was employed as a Production Manager, and from 1955 till 1962 he was the Works Director. [...] Between 1957 and 1961 he successfully studied for an Economics degree through a correspondence course with the Karl Marx University (as it was then called) in Leipzig. Georgi then moved on, and in 1963 he became General Director with VVB Eisen-, Bleche- und Metallwaren (VVB EBM), an {{iron and steel products}} producer in Chemnitz. [...] In April 1966 he received his doctorate, again from Karl Marx University in Leipzig. [...] His doctoral dissertation, reflecting his job, was entitled [...] "Problems of the further development of product-group work at VVB EBM to ensure needs-focused production in the entire industry branch".Dr.Georgi's transfer into government came in 1963 when he was appointed Minister for the Construction of Industrial Machinery and Vehicles. [...] The country's constitution by now asserted the leading role of The Party, so that in some ways it was the primary task of government ministers simply to carry out party policy, though at the higher levels the same individuals were generally in positions of power and influence in both institutions, making the distinction relatively unimportant. By 1963 there were approximately fifteen government ministers covering departments with areas of responsibility not dissimilar from their western equivalents. Additionally, however, {{by the time of the}} New Economic System of Planning and Direction (Neues Ökonomisches System der Planung und Leitung) established (formally) in 1961, there were a further (approximately) fifteen ministers with responsibility for individual industry sectors. From the perspective of western observers, the industry sector-specific ministers came into focus when they appeared on East German stands at international trade fairs. [...] In 1976, following a reconfiguration of industry ministry areas of responsibility, Georgi became the [...] "Minister for the Production of Tooling and Processing Machinery". [...] The <b>construction</b> of heavy <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> was a traditional strength of the German economy which by now the Comecon planners were keep to promote, and Georgi was evidently good at his job, since unusually among his industry minister colleagues in 1976, he was still in post in 1989.

40|$|Purpose – A {{literature}} review {{is presented in}} the subject of <b>construction</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> management (CPeM) to: delineate the subject; consider its development over recent years; and identify principal themes within it. The paper aims to close the gap in knowledge, by using these objectives as a mechanism to observe how research themes relate to primary CPeM functions, and to suggest future research direction. Design/methodology/approach – A thematic review of CPeM academic literature (in the main, refereed journal papers published in English-speaking countries over the last decade) is undertaken; the nature of identified themes is discussed, for instance, regarding why they might have evolved as they have; and based on the foregone, themes for future research in the field are proffered. Findings – CPeM is found well established within the broader subject of construction management. Eight principal themes are identified, namely plant maintenance; downtime and productivity; optimisation; robotics and automation; health and safety; operators and competence; machine control; and “miscellaneous”. Research limitations/implications – It is proffered that based on informational/technological advancements coupled with growing environmental/financial pressures, future CPeM research will strive to facilitate even greater plant reliability and safer modes of working. It is suggested that “optimum production methods” and “minimal resource consumption” will become inherent theme goals.

40|$|Abstract-The {{environmental}} and safety performance of construction sites are increasingly regarded as critical factors {{that need to}} be monitored for the successful completion of construction projects. Research has also repeatedly highlighted the need to minimise the carbon footprint of the construction process and enhance the capacity of the project team and on-site workers in detecting and avoiding potential construction site hazards. However, a multi-dimensional visualisation technology that would allow project teams to simulate potential carbon emissions from <b>construction</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> and to detect potentially ‘dangerous’ locations on a construction site is currently lacking. This paper illustrates an integrated 5 D model that uses virtual prototyping technologies to quantify carbon emissions, simulate the pattern of emissions from the overall construction process and identify potential ‘black spots ’ of site hazards at the planning stage. The proposed 5 D BIM based pro-active construction management system (PCMS) can help to detect potential sources of danger to on-site workers and provides pro-active warnings to prevent fatal accidents caused by falling or being struck by moving objects. A public housing project developed by the Hong Kong Housing Authority is used as a case study to demonstrate the integration of the emission prediction visualisation and accident detection tool into the BIM. The proposed tool demonstrates the utilisation of BIM technology to promote pro-active carbon mitigation and safety performance strategies...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – <b>Construction</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> harbour {{significant}} {{health and}} safety hazards. One particular item, the mini-excavator, presents a hazard from its inherent instability and tendency to overturn during use. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate turnover incidents to observe prominent factors and contribute to development of best practice guidance for improving {{health and safety}} relating to mini-excavator use. Design/methodology/approach – Comprehensive documentary data from eight case study incidents, along with anecdotal data from a further three, were qualitatively analysed in terms of: machine weight, machine activity, ground type/topography, operator competence, type of overturn, damage to property, and injury to person(s). Results were presented to experts in the field for comment and conclusions/recommendations accordingly developed. Findings – Observed prominent casual factors include: inadequate assessment of risk and non-adherence to safe working practice, working on poor ground, and working on inclined surfaces. The use of sealed operator cabs and proprietary seat restraint mechanisms seem to mitigate risk of personal injury to operators during overturn incidents. A need for cyclic training to reiterate good operator and banksman practice is emphasised, while construction managers should also be aware of the risks, and help implement risk controls. Research limitations/implications – Findings will inform construction plant management research generally, and the subject of mechanised workplace transport stability specifically. Practical implications – Best practice protocol will inform health and safety management of mini-excavators at the workplace. Originality/value – Academic research into mini-excavator stability is embryonic; this paper furthers evolving knowledge in the field...|$|E

40|$|Utilization of <b>construction</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> {{forms an}} {{essential}} part of construction contractors' efforts to augment productivity and reduce costs. However, efficient and effective management of plant and equipment is requisite to maximizing its potential benefits. A problem in this respect is not knowing when a maintenance event might occur, or its extent in terms of cost and time. This paper presents a stochastic mathematical modelling methodology (using random numbers) to predict the probable cost of ‘the next’ maintenance event for tracked hydraulic excavators; where a maintenance event includes both breakdown and scheduled maintenance. Information on a random sample of 33 360 ° tracked hydraulic excavators were obtained from contractors operating within the opencast mining industry. From these, 9473 maintenance event ‘cost’ observations were recorded and modelled. Validation of the model is achieved using a random ‘hold out’ sample of 50 maintenance cost observations taken from nine machines. Analyses reveal that overall model predictive performance is robust, having a mean percentage error (MPE) of 4. 46 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 23. 63. Pearsons correlation coefficient (r) and a paired t-test are conducted to determine the accuracy and consistency of model predictions respectively. With an r of 0. 76 and no significant difference being found between the mean of predicted/actual values, the model shows both accurate and consistent cost predictions. The random number technique shows potential for improved maintenance practice by providing a practical methodology for planning, scheduling and controlling future plant resource requirements. The paper concludes with direction for future research which includes: (1) the application of this research to plant items working in other operational environments (e. g. civil engineering and construction); and (2) prediction of the next breakdown event...|$|E

Accordingly, processes adopted for <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> H&S management on UK construction sites are documented and process analysed, {{with a view to}} employing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as a mechanism to achieving improvement. Case studies derived from five construction projects involving members of the former Major Contractors Group (MCG) were used to yield H&S process data, that were analysed using data flow diagram (DFD) techniques. Processes are evaluated and improvements to these proffered; as a result of both DFD and 'constant comparison' analyses. The likely causes of unsafe practices on construction sites regarding management of <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> are found to include: aspects of the plant itself; issues of the management process; and operator training and competence. A new 'process paradigm' is suggested, that determines the potential use of ICT for process improvement.

This paper examines how heterogeneity in the operating condition of firms' <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment,</b> which cannot be observed by policy makers, can affect the choice between incentives to encourage conversion to a cleaner technology. By relating different conditions of firms' <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> to production costs, extent of environmental damage, and cost of conversion to a cleaner technology, we show when a perfectly discriminating incentive to encourage conversion is not feasible. In addition, we show that firms with <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> in better condition will convert their technology to mitigate their environmental damage, <b>and</b> firms with <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> in poorer condition will not. This and a series of additional results lead to conditions under which an administratively simple uniform lump-sum incentive to switch to cleaner technology is preferable to one based on output. These results and conditions extend to cases where there are network externalities in conversion, and where there is strategic timing in firms' choice of when to convert. technology conversion, environmental management, taxes and subsidies, capital vintage, incentives...|$|R
