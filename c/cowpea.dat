5|$|Insects are a {{major factor}} in the low yields of African <b>cowpea</b> crops, and they affect each tissue {{component}} and developmental stage of the plant. In bad infestations insect pressure is responsible for over 90% loss in yield. The legume pod borer, Maruca vitrata, is the main pre-harvest pest of the <b>cowpea.</b> Other important pests include pod sucking bugs, thrips and the post-harvest <b>cowpea</b> weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{most other}} {{important}} crops, {{little is known}} about the domestication, dispersal and cultivation history of the <b>cowpea.</b> Although there is no archaeological evidence for early <b>cowpea</b> cultivation the centre of diversity of the cultivated <b>cowpea</b> is West Africa, leading an early consensus that this is the likely centre of origin and place of early domestication. New research using molecular markers has suggested that domestication may have instead occurred in East Africa and currently both theories carry equal weight.|$|E
5|$|Most cowpeas {{are grown}} on the African continent, {{particularly}} in Nigeria and Niger {{which account for}} 66% of world production. A 1997 estimate suggests that cowpeas are cultivated on , have a worldwide production of 3 million tonnes and are consumed by 200 million people on a daily basis. Insect infestation is a major constraint {{to the production of}} <b>cowpea,</b> sometimes causing losses of over 90% loss in yield.

40|$|<b>Cowpeas</b> (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp) are legumes widely {{consumed}} in developing countries. Because <b>cowpeas</b> {{are an important}} source of proteins, calories and vitamins, they have the potential to alleviate protein-energy malnutrition. However, the consumption of <b>cowpeas</b> is impaired by the hard-to-cook (HTC) defect, which develops when <b>cowpeas</b> are stored at high temperature and humidity conditions. HTC <b>cowpeas</b> require extended time to cook and have decreased protein, starch, vitamin availability and poor textural quality. The extended cooking time and poor textural quality reduce consumer preference and acceptability. Soaking <b>cowpeas</b> in water or in a solution containing monovalent cations have been used by other researchers to reduce the cooking time of normal and HTC <b>cowpeas,</b> while micronization has been used to reduce the cooking time of normal <b>cowpeas.</b> Hence preconditioning in water or in a solution containing monovalent (Na+) cations in combination with micronization, could have the potential to help in alleviating the HTC phenomenon in legume seeds, especially <b>cowpeas.</b> This study was undertaken in two parts. The first part consisted of inducing the hard-tocook (HTC) defect and determining its effect on cooking and physicochemicalcharacteristics of <b>cowpeas.</b> The second part consisted of attempting to alleviate the HTC defect in <b>cowpeas</b> by pre-conditioning <b>cowpeas</b> in water or in a solution with monovalent (Na+) cations and its combination with micronization. The effect of these treatments on cooking and physicochemical characteristics of normal and HTC <b>cowpeas</b> were studied. Storing <b>cowpeas</b> at high temperature and high relative humidity, increased the cooking time of <b>cowpeas</b> (Mogwe-o-Kgotsheng) from 89 to more than 270 min. The increase in the cooking time was associated with reduced pectin solubility, which was coincident with a decrease in phytic acid content and an increase in phytase activity. According to the “phytate-divalent cations-pectins” theory, at adverse storage conditions, phytase probably hydrolysed phytate to release divalent cations which migrated to the middle lamella to bind with pectins, reducing their solubility. Because of the reduced pectin solubility of HTC <b>cowpeas,</b> the hardness of cooked seeds increased, the degree of splitting reduced and water absorbed during cooking consequently reduced as compared with normal <b>cowpeas.</b> This research supports the “phytate-divalent cations-pectins” as an important mechanism to explain the HTC-defect in legume seeds. From a practical standpoint, pre-conditioning <b>cowpeas</b> in water on its own was effective in reducing the cooking time of normal <b>cowpeas</b> from 89 to 44 min. This coincided with an improvement of pectin solubility, degree of splitting and decreased hardness. For HTC <b>cowpeas,</b> a combination of pre-conditioning in a solution containing monovalent (Na+) cations and micronization was needed to optimally reduce the cooking time from more than 270 min to 59 min. This coincided with an improvement of pectin solubility, degree of splitting and decrease in the hardness of cooked <b>cowpeas.</b> Pre-conditioning <b>cowpeas</b> in water induced the solubilization of pectins in the middle lamella of normal and HTC <b>cowpeas.</b> Pre-conditioning <b>cowpeas</b> in a solution with monovalent (Na+) cations improved pectin solubility due to the solubilization effect of water as well as a conversion of insoluble pectins to soluble pectins by monovalent (Na+) cations. Micronization improved pectin solubility further by breaking pectin molecules into lower and more soluble fractions, probably via the β-elimination reaction. Micronization also decreased the hardness of cooked seeds and increased the degree of splitting for both normal and HTC <b>cowpeas.</b> However, the reduction in hardness and increase in the degree of splitting were more pronounced in normal than in HTC <b>cowpeas,</b> probably becausemore divalent cations were bound to the pectins of HTC <b>cowpeas.</b> For normal <b>cowpeas,</b> the improvement of pectin solubility, decrease in texture of cooked seeds and increase in the splitting as influenced by micronization was reflected in the increase of the amount of water absorbed during cooking, which could have contributed to the reduction in the cooking time. However, for HTC {{this was not the case}} as the water absorbed during cooking decreased. The reduction in the amount of water absorbed during cooking could be associated with protein denaturation during storage at adverse conditions and during micronization. The improvement of pectin solubility was at higher levels when all the treatments were applied in HTC <b>cowpeas</b> than in normal <b>cowpeas.</b> However, this was not coincident with reduction in the cooking times. This suggests that factors (i. e. proteins, starch) other than pectin solubility could have contributed to the cooking time of HTC <b>cowpeas.</b> Pre-conditioning <b>cowpeas</b> in a solution with monovalent (Na+) cations in combination with micronization has a definite potential to help alleviate the HTC defect in <b>cowpeas.</b> E 846 /gmDissertation (MSc(Agric)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.

5|$|<b>Cowpea</b> is {{susceptible}} to nematode, fungal, bacterial and virus diseases, which can result in substantial loss in yield. Common diseases include blights, root rot, wilt, powdery mildew, root knot, rust and leaf spot. The plant is {{susceptible to}} mosaic viruses, which cause a green mosaic pattern {{to appear in the}} leaves. The <b>cowpea</b> mosaic virus (CPMV), discovered in 1959, has become a useful research tool. CPMV is stable and easy to propagate to a high yield, making it useful in vector development and protein expression systems. One of the plant's defenses against some insect attacks is the cow pea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI is the only gene obtained outside of B. thuringiensis that has been inserted into a commercially available genetically modified crop.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas {{are grown}} mostly for their edible beans, {{although}} the leaves, green peas and green pea pods {{can also be}} consumed, meaning the <b>cowpea</b> {{can be used as}} a food source before the dried peas are harvested.

5|$|Four {{subspecies}} of <b>cowpea</b> are recognised, {{of which}} three are cultivated. There {{is a high}} level of morphological diversity found within the species with large variations in the size, shape and structure of the plant.

5|$|Cowpeas seeds {{provide a}} rich source of {{proteins}} and calories, as well as minerals and vitamins. This complements the mainly cereal diet in countries that grow cowpeas as a major food crop.
