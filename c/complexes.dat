5|$|Alkali metal cations do {{not usually}} form {{coordination}} <b>complexes</b> with simple Lewis bases {{due to their}} low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li+ ion forms most <b>complexes</b> and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less (though exceptions occur for weak <b>complexes).</b> Lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits coordination numbers from 1 to 12, although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode. In aqueous solution, the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate <b>complexes</b> (+), {{with the exception of}} the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate <b>complexes</b> (+); the alkali metals form these <b>complexes</b> because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules. Because of this, anhydrous salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as desiccants. Alkali metals also readily form <b>complexes</b> with crown ethers (e.g. 12-crown-4 for Li+, 15-crown-5 for Na+, 18-crown-6 for K+, and 21-crown-7 for Rb+) and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction.|$|E

Vanadium ion is rather large and some <b>complexes</b> achieve coordination numbers greater than 6, {{as is the}} case in 4−. Oxovanadium(V) also forms 7 coordinate coordination <b>complexes</b> with tetradentate ligands and peroxides and these <b>complexes</b> are used for oxidative brominations and thioether oxidations. The coordination chemistry of V4+ is dominated by the vanadyl center, VO2+, which binds four other ligands strongly and one weakly (the one trans to the vanadyl center). An example is vanadyl acetylacetonate (V(O)(O2C5H7)2). In this complex, the vanadium is 5-coordinate, square pyramidal, meaning that a sixth ligand, such as pyridine, may be attached, though the association constant of this process is small. Many 5-coordinate vanadyl <b>complexes</b> have a trigonal bypyramidal geometry, such as VOCl2(NMe3)2. The coordination chemistry of V5+ is dominated by the relatively stable dioxovanadium coordination <b>complexes</b> which are often formed by aerial oxidation of the vanadium(IV) precursors indicating the stability of the +5 oxidation state and ease of interconversion between the +4 and +5 states.|$|E

The Ca2+ ion is quite large, so that high coordination numbers are the rule. The large size of strontium and barium plays a significant part in stabilising strontium <b>complexes</b> with polydentate macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers: for example, while 18-crown-6 forms relatively weak <b>complexes</b> with calcium and the alkali metals, its strontium and barium <b>complexes</b> are much stronger.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the most}} {{important}} oxidation state for silver in <b>complexes</b> is +1. The Ag+ cation is diamagnetic, like its homologues Cu+ and Au+, as all three have closed-shell electron configurations with no unpaired electrons: its <b>complexes</b> are colourless provided the ligands are not too easily polarized such as I−. Ag+ forms salts with most anions, but it is reluctant to coordinate to oxygen and thus most of these salts are insoluble in water: the exceptions are the nitrate, perchlorate, and fluoride. The tetracoordinate tetrahedral aqueous ion + is known, but the characteristic geometry for the Ag+ cation is 2-coordinate linear. For example, silver chloride dissolves readily in excess aqueous ammonia to form +; silver salts are dissolved in photography due {{to the formation of}} the thiosulfate complex 3−; and cyanide extraction for silver (and gold) works by the formation of the complex −. Silver cyanide forms the linear polymer {Ag–C≡N→Ag–C≡N→}; silver thiocyanate has a similar structure, but forms a zigzag instead because of the sp3-hybridized sulfur atom. Chelating ligands are unable to form linear <b>complexes</b> and thus silver(I) <b>complexes</b> with them tend to form polymers; a few exceptions exist, such as the near-tetrahedral diphosphine and diarsine <b>complexes</b> +.|$|E
