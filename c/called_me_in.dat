500|$|Malone {{credited}} Howarth's versatility {{with the}} reason he was cast as Todd. [...] During a February 1993 interview with Soap Opera Digest (SOD), Howarth stated he was surprised he won the part. [...] "I really don't know how I made it," [...] he said. He met a One Life to Live casting director two years previously, while performing in a New York play, but, when the role of Todd opened up, he [...] "auditioned just like everybody else". He [...] "made it to callbacks, and [...] got the part". Howarth said, [...] "I was hired... to plant drugs in Jason Webb's jacket. All I knew was that my first name was Todd. I don't know what happened next. They <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> again and suddenly I had a last name 'Manning.' Then I get called to read another day." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, by August the BBC {{had decided}} to {{terminate}} the group due to perceived unpopularity and being [...] "... {{out of step with}} viewers". Their final appearance was in October 1976 (by this time Trace and Gillespie had already left, reducing Ruby Flipper to five members), with the senior management insisting on a replacement all-female grouping. Flick Colby recalled of this time [...] "Bill Cotton <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> and said the British public didn’t want to see black men dancing with white women...I argued, but he told me to form another all-girl group or I was out." ...|$|E
2500|$|And I {{passed a}} house, {{and there was}} a woman, and I {{remember}} that she was a little tongue-tied, sitting on a step. And she saw what was happening, and she <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>in.</b> And she spent about 20 minutes treating me like an adult, teaching me how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I knew how to do it, and then she taught me how to tie a knot. And we sat there for a while, and then I went along. And, as little as I was, I thought, [...] "I'd like to be like that kind of person. I'd like to be like her." [...] I think it influenced my entire life, a little thing.|$|E

2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Steve Hewitt {{and the rest}} of the band had become tense during the recording of Meds and eventually, in October 2007, the band announced that Hewitt was no longer in Placebo. Molko commented that [...] "Being in a band is very much like being in a marriage, and in couples—in this case a triple—people can grow apart over the years. To say that you don't love your partner anymore is inaccurate, considering all that you've been through and achieved together. There simply comes a point when you realise that you want different things from your relationship and that you can no longer live under the same roof, so to speak". Olsdal commented [...] "We couldn't go on with Steve Hewitt. We didn't have the same goals, nor the same vision anymore. We had to separate. It all went wrong during the Meds tour. [...] There was no communication between us. Brian and I are one, but at some point we even didn't talk to each other anymore. We realised Placebo was dying. To be able to go on, things had to change." [...] According to Hewitt, [...] "Alex Weston, our manager, [...] <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> to the office and said I was not in the band anymore. And that's it. I was thrown out". Hewitt claims that it was [...] "very hurtful" [...] and [...] "disappointing" [...] to have been ejected in this way after being in the band for over a decade. Early in 2008 Hewitt founded the band Love Amongst Ruin, switching to guitar and singing lead vocals. In August 2012 he became the drummer of the reformed Six by Seven.|$|E

60|$|It {{was late}} in the {{afternoon}} when, on tapping at the door in search of tidings, Ormond <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>in.</b> The daylight was fading, but I could see the limp, suffering shape on the bed, and Grace sitting near the window, leaning forward as though listening.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, truly," [...] {{said the}} Friar demurely, [...] "some do <b>call</b> <b>me</b> the Curtal Friar of Fountain Dale; others again <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> jest the Abbot of Fountain Abbey; others still again <b>call</b> <b>me</b> simple Friar Tuck." ...|$|R

60|$|Just {{where we}} left off talking I could not remember, for I dropped off to sleep. I seemed hardly to have closed my eyes when the hunter <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the morning. The breakfast was smoking on the red-hot coals, and outside the cabin all was dense gray fog.|$|E
6000|$|Alphonse retreated, and I {{heard no}} more of his groans.

'Three o'clock,' he said: 'we must begin to move at half-past.' ...|$|E

I {{happen to know}} Lady Sara by sight; her noble mother has <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> professionally.

60|$|Wolf Larsen {{underwent}} another bad {{attack of}} headache which lasted two days. He must have suffered severely, for he <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> and obeyed my commands like a sick child. But nothing I could do seemed to relieve him. At my suggestion, however, {{he gave up}} smoking and drinking; though why such a magnificent animal as he should have headaches at all puzzles me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But he was {{an extravagant}} fellow,' said Mr. Annesley: 'he <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> at his bouleversement for advice, as I have the {{reputation}} of a good economist. I {{do not know how}} it is, though I see these things perpetually happen; but why men, and men of small fortunes, should commit such follies, really exceeds my comprehension.

60|$|He {{said nothing}} {{about it all the}} morning; but before he went away in the {{afternoon}} he <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>in,</b> and told me that I need not make myself at all uneasy about his daughter's happiness. He had assured her, he said, that it was all nonsense; and he had nothing more to say to her. He believed he was an indulgent father (as indeed he was), and I might spare myself any solicitude on her account.|$|E
60|$|She grew rapidly worse {{all through}} the opening days of April and as we were {{necessarily}} out in the fields at work, and mother was busied with her household affairs, the lonely sufferer {{was glad to have}} her bed in the living room--and there she lay, her bright eyes following mother at her work, growing whiter and whiter until one beautiful, tragic morning in early May, my father <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> to say good-bye to her.|$|E
