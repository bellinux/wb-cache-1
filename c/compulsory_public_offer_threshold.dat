50|$|In {{the years}} 1772-1918 (see: Partitions of Poland), Tarnobrzeg {{was in the}} {{province}} of Galicia as part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, based in Vienna.

The same was not true for other Polish Jewry in areas outside of Galicia, e.g., Danzig or Warsaw. <b>Compulsory</b> <b>public</b> education was opposed by some Jewish religious authorities who believed that traditional Jewish Torah and Talmud studies should not even be partially supplanted by secular instruction.|$|R

Greater exposure outside the home and education itself often created opportunities for shim-pua daughters to resist or escape the marriage arrangement.|$|R
