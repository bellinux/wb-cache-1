40|$|Aquaculture of <b>cobia,</b> Rachycentron canadum is {{hampered}} {{by lack of}} good feeding protocols and nutritionally optimized diets. Studies {{on the role of}} appetite and feeding behavior regulating neuropeptides in <b>cobia</b> have not been pursued to date. The current study initially assessed the impact of plant-based protein diets with different lysine (L) to arginine (A) ratios on appetite and feed intake, feed efficiencies, growth performance, and the deposition of protein and lipid in juvenile <b>cobia.</b> In addition, this study also aimed to determine whether there is a link between the dietary ratio of lysine to arginine, feed consumption, and expression of <b>cobia</b> brain neuropeptides (npy and cck). In a pilot experiment, juvenile <b>cobia</b> were fed to satiety with two commercial diets (CD 1 and CD 2) or the plant-based protein test diet with balanced lysine to arginine ratio (1. 1; BL/A) had equal feeding rate of 5. 3 - 5. 4 ± 0. 3 % BW (for a meal). No differences in stomach filling occurred between <b>cobia</b> fed the test diet and the two commercial diets. Gastric evacuation rates in <b>cobia</b> were performed as an exponential relationship, and were estimated as the function YT=V 0 e-b(x) (VT, volume of feed at time T; V 0, volume of feed at time 0; b, the instantaneous evacuation rate; and x, time postprandial; R 2 > 0. 95). Between 77 to 80 % of the stomach contents were evacuated to the lower parts of the gastrointestinal tract at 8 h, and most of consumed feed (98 %) was emptied out of the stomach at 16 h postprandial. In experiment I, juvenile <b>cobia</b> fed with two commercial diets (CD 1 and CD 2) and the BL/A diet (for 4 weeks) grew as well as one of the commercial diet, but better than the other. However, <b>cobia</b> fed the CD 2 diet deposited more lipid than <b>cobia</b> fed the BL/A diet. <b>Cobia</b> fed the BL/A diet obtained better weight gain, feed conversion ratio and protein gain than <b>cobia</b> fed the commercial diet CD 1, while lipid gain was less in fish fed the BL/A diet. No differences in plasma amino acid profile analyzed at 24 h postprandial were observed between <b>cobia</b> fed any of the three diets. Thus, juvenile <b>cobia</b> had the ability to grow and utilize the plant-based protein diet and these two commercial diets. In experiment II, juvenile <b>cobia</b> were fed to satiety with three test diets of plant-based protein and different lysine to arginine ratio (0. 8, LL/A; 1. 1, BL/A; and 1. 8, HL/A) diets and the CD 2 diet as a control for growth for 6 weeks. Similar growth performance was found for the balanced lysine to arginine ratio diet, but imbalanced lysine to arginine ratio reduced performance. In experiment III, juvenile <b>cobia</b> were fed to satiety with the LL/A-, BL/A- and HL/A diet, using the CD 2 diet as control for 6 weeks. Periprandial expression of brain mRNA for NPY and CCK (npy and cck) were measured twice, at weeks 1 and 6. Feed intake and growth performance were also recorded. At week one, levels of expressed brain npy were significantly higher in pre-feeding <b>cobia</b> (unfed) than fed <b>cobia,</b> except in the fish fed the LL/A diet. At week six, expression of brain npy in unfed <b>cobia</b> was significantly higher than in fed <b>cobia</b> for all diets. For brain cck, {{there were no significant differences}} in expression, regardless of feeding status (pre-feeding or after a meal with any of the diets) or time point. This indicates that NPY serves as an orexigenic factor in <b>cobia.</b> No clear correlations between the dietary lysine to arginine ratios and feed intake, growth and expression of npy and cck was found. <b>Cobia</b> fed the LL/A diet had lower feed intake than those fed the BL/A- and control diet, while <b>cobia</b> fed both imbalanced diets (LL/A and HL/A) had reduced growth, compared to <b>cobia</b> fed the BL/A- and control diet. This suggests the existence of a mechanism that links dietary lysine and/or arginine to regulation of appetite and feed intake in <b>cobia.</b> In conclusion, <b>cobia</b> grew and utilized the diet with high plant ingredient inclusion. Imbalanced dietary lysine to arginine ratios negatively affected feed intake and feed efficiencies, thus reduced growth. Brain npy levels in fed <b>cobia</b> were significantly lower than that in pre-feeding <b>cobia,</b> suggesting that NPY is an orexigenic factor in <b>cobia.</b> Dietary lysine to arginine affected the expression of npy at short-term feeding, but not at long-term feeding, suggested that feeding-regulating adaptation may exist in <b>cobia.</b> Meanwhile, brain cck levels in unfed <b>cobia</b> did not differ from that in fed <b>cobia,</b> regardless of dietary lysine to arginine ratios or time point in the current study. </p...|$|R

40|$|Cobia (Rachycentron canadum) is a pelagic, {{migratory species}} with a transoceanic {{distribution}} in tropical and subtropical waters. Recreational fishing pressure on Cobia in the United States has increased substantially {{during the last}} decade, especially in areas of its annual inshore aggregations, making this species potentially susceptible to overfishing. Although Cobia along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the southeastern United States are currently managed as a single fishery, the genetic composition of <b>Cobias</b> in these areas is unclear.

40|$|The {{growth of}} three cohorts of captive reared <b>cobia,</b> grown in a {{combination}} of flow-though and recirculating aquaculture systems, was progressively measured to determine the existence and extent of sexually dimorphic growth in <b>cobia.</b> Approximately 100 fish from each cohort were individually identified and regularly weighed until the average weight of the fish was approximately 5 kg. The sex of individuals was determined through gonadal observations {{at the conclusion of}} each trial and the gender fitted retrospectively to the growth data set.

This was the first reported observation of intersex gonads in <b>cobia</b> and the first reported occurrence of intersex gonads from a gonochoristic fish species from Australian waters. Only one fish out of the 182 examined in the third cohort was identified as intersex. There was no sexually dimorphic growth in <b>cobia</b> when there was a relatively high incidence of the intersex anomaly, as seen in the first two cohorts of fish.

Histological analysis of ovaries confirmed the presence of actively spawning females inshore, and gonadosomatic index (GSI) values from females collected inshore (mean= 7. 8) were higher than the values from females caught offshore (mean= 5. 6); both of these mean values indicate that spawning occurred locally. Additionally, we conducted an ichthyoplankton survey in 2008 and found <b>cobia</b> eggs and larvae as far as 10 and 15 km inshore from the mouths of SHS and PRS, respectively. A study of egg development that we conducted in 2007 and 2008 using hatchery-reared <b>cobia</b> eggs provided descriptions of embryological development of <b>cobia.</b> Comparison of visual and quantitative characteristics of the field-collected eggs with those of the hatchery-reared eggs allowed positive identification of eggs collected in plankton samples.

40|$|<b>Cobia</b> is a {{potential}} fish species for marine aquaculture due to its rapid growth and succulent flesh. However, shortage of high quality fingerlings remains a bottle neck for further propagation of the species. This PhD thesis aimed to {{study the effects of}} feeds, feeding frequency and rearing density on the performance of <b>cobia</b> larvae and early juveniles, with focus on the co-feeding and weaning stage. During weaning, growth and survival of <b>cobia</b> juveniles were affected by the rearing density, but not by the feeding frequency. A commercial dry feed (NRD®, INVE Aquaculture SA) showed its advantages in comparison {{with the use of the}} home-made moist diet or minced trash fish in terms of growth and survival improvement. The study results also revealed the acceptance of the dry diet of <b>cobia</b> juveniles during weaning stage. <b>Cobia</b> larvae grow very fast and they may need high amounts of nutrition from the onset of exogenous feeding onwards. Use of umbrella-stage of Artemia franciscana (UAF) revealed that <b>cobia</b> larvae are able to ingest and digest UAF since the first feeding. Replacing enriched rotifers by UAF as starter food for <b>cobia</b> larvae had very little effect on larval growth by 8 dph and appeared to have no significant negative effect on larval quality, growth or survival by 18 dph. In order to balance and improve the nutritional condition of the larvae, early co-feeding of Proton® from 8 dph was conducted and resulted in better growth. The use of the experimental diet with a higher n- 3 HUFA content and DHA/EPA ratio, compared to Proton® or NRD®, significantly improved growth and survival of <b>cobia</b> at the stage of 20 - 38 dph, but was not appropriate for early co-feeding at the stage 8 - 23 dph. <b>Cobia</b> larvae retain DHA rather than other fatty acids in their body: the content of DHA and other fatty acids in the larval tissues decreased according to their age (0 - 12 dph), but the DHA/EPA ratio increased. Higher levels of dietary DHA and DHA/EPA ratios resulted in a better growth and survival of <b>cobia</b> juveniles (12 - 30 dph). Levels of DHA and DHA/EPA ratio in the juvenile tissues and in the diets could not be correlated, but the best survival in the transportation test was recorded in the treatments fed high dietary DHA content and DHA/EA ratio. In conclusion, our study revealed that <b>cobia</b> larvae are able to ingest and digest UAF from first feeding onwards. Growth, survival and quality of <b>cobia</b> juveniles can be improved by manipulation of early co-feeding of formulated diets, appropriate rearing density and feeding frequency as well as appropriate dietary DHA and DHA/EPA ratio. More researches for further improvement of UAF and formulation of the appropriate weaning diets were suggested...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cobia</b> (Rachycentron canadum) {{has been}} {{considered}} as a potential species for aquaculture because of its fast growth and commercial value. As a consequence of successful spawning and seed production, {{there has been a}} significant demand for cage farming of <b>cobia</b> in India (Philipose et al. 2013). Not many reports are available on diseases of cage-farmed <b>cobia.</b> Globally, mortality due to pasteurellosis in cage-cultured <b>cobia</b> caused by Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida has been reported (Liu, Lin & Lee 2003). Vibriosis caused by Vibrio alginolyticus, V. harveyi, V. parahemolyticus and V. vulnificus has also been responsible for mortalities in cage-cultured <b>cobia</b> (Rajan et al. 2001; Liu et al. 2004). Photobacterium damselae subsp. damselae was originally isolated from the skin lesions of damsel fish, Chromis punctipinnis (Love et al. 1981). Subsequently, diseases caused by this pathogen have been reported in several cultivable fish species like seabream (Vera, Navas & Fouz 1991), eel (Ketterer & Eaves 1992), turbot (Fouz et al. 1992), ovate pompano (Zhao et al. 2009) and Asian seabass (Kanchanopas-Barnette et al. 2009).

Therefore, a 3 x 2 factorial experimental design involving three inclusion levels (0, 210 and 315 g/kg) of lupin Lupinus angustifolius kernel meal (LKM) and two concentrations (0 and 0. 8 mg/kg) of Se was used to evaluate the effects of Se supplementation in conjunction with LKM on the growth, feed utilisation and physiological responses in the <b>cobia.</b> Six isonitrogenous (46. 5 % crude protein) and isoenergetic (21 MJ/kg gross energy) diets were formulated and fed to <b>cobia</b> for 7 weeks in a flow-through seawater system. The results showed significant effects of Se supplementation and its interaction with dietary lupin on the growth and feed efficiency of <b>cobia.</b> Se supplementation significantly improved the growth and feed utilisation efficiency in <b>cobia</b> fed lupin-based diets. The nutrient digestibility of fish fed supplemental Se lupin-based diets was significantly higher than that of fish fed diets without Se supplementation at each inclusion level of LKM. There were no significant effects of dietary Se supplementation on the survival, muscle composition or muscle amino acids, whereas regression analysis indicated a positive linear relationship between tissue Se accumulation and dietary Se levels. An enhancement of haematological responses was also observed in <b>cobia</b> fed Se-supplemented diets. In summary, <b>cobia</b> fed lupin-based diets required higher dietary Se supplementation for higher feed utilisation efficiency than previously quantified for the casein-based diet...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>cobia</b> is sold commercially and {{commands}} {{a relatively}} high price for its firm texture and excellent flavor. However, no designated wild fishery exists {{because it is a}} solitary species. It has been farmed in aquaculture. The flesh is usually sold fresh. It is typically served in the form of grilled or poached fillets. Chefs Jamie Oliver and Mario Batali each cooked several dishes made with <b>cobia</b> in the [...] "Battle Cobia" [...] episode of the Food Network program Iron Chef America, which first aired in January, 2008.
