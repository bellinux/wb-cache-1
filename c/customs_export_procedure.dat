40|$|This paper {{describes}} the <b>exported</b> <b>procedure</b> call, a mechanism that pushes computation {{out of the}} operating system kernel and into user space. It supports a simple, secure model for system extensions. An <b>exported</b> <b>procedure</b> call incurs overhead crossing the kernel-user boundary, but once in user space, it has greater security and usability and is signicantly simpler. This paper demonstrates {{the capabilities of the}} <b>exported</b> <b>procedure</b> call by discussing two implementations. One is the Modify-on-access (Mona) le system and the other is the Magi device interface. Mona and Magi use the <b>exported</b> <b>procedure</b> call in order to safely execute untrusted or complex system extensions. This paper shows that in situations where raw kernel performance is not paramount, the <b>exported</b> <b>procedure</b> call is desirable. ...|$|R

The <b>export</b> <b>procedure</b> consists of some stages: hunting buyer, opening Letter of Credit (L/C), batik payment and production, clearance, and shipping. Hunting buyer is a process to look for the buyer candidates and promote their batik products to the buyer candidates through internet. Opening Letter of Credit (L/C) is a process to make written treaty through banks. Batik payment and production is a process when the buyer pays the good while the exporter produces the goods. Managing shipment documents is a process to prepare the shipment documents. Finally, shipping is a process to shipping the goods to the buyer using ship or airplane. There are some problems of the <b>export</b> <b>procedure</b> CV Haryan Handicrafts Surakarta; the batik design, the cost, and delivery time. The batik design is complicated enough and the employees have to be careful to make the batik products. The batik price is unstable and it can be caused by cost of the materials.

Delivery time can be influenced by the problems of batik production which causes the delivery time become late. Therefore, CV Haryan Handicrafts Surakarta should discuss with the buyer to ask tolerance...|$|R

40|$|Researchers {{typically}} spend {{significant amounts}} of time cleaning and labeling data files in preparation of analyses of survey data. Computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) gives the ability to automate this process. First, consistency checks can be run during the interview so that only data that passes autogenerated and user-written validation tests comes back from the field. Second, CAPI allows for the autogeneration of a Stata do-file that labels data files. This presentation discusses the Stata <b>export</b> <b>procedure</b> used by surveybe, a CAPI application designed to handle complex surveys. The questions, as displayed on the screen to the interviewer, are automatically turned into variable labels. Likewise, the drop-down menus are autocoded as value labels. Furthermore, the <b>export</b> <b>procedure</b> ensures that data from rosters get exported into different Stata data files and that complete referential integrity is ensured across all the files originating from the same survey, with unique primary keys linking files together. Any changes made to the electronic questionnaire (for example, adding a response code to the drop-down menu) or changes to the phrasing of a question will be automatically incorporated into the exported data files, thus ensuring that the data files match the questionnaires completely. ...|$|R
