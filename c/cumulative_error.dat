2500|$|When {{viscosity}} can be neglected, the outflow rate of {{the water}} is governed by Torricelli's law, or more generally, by Bernoulli's principle. Viscosity will dominate the outflow rate if the water flows out through a nozzle that is sufficiently long and thin, as given by the Hagen–Poiseuille equation. Approximately, the flow rate is for such design inversely proportional to the viscosity, which depends on the temperature. Liquids generally become less viscous as the temperature increases. In the case of water, the viscosity varies {{by a factor of}} about seven between zero and 100 degrees Celsius. Thus, a water clock with such a nozzle would run about seven times faster at 100°C than at 0°C. Water is about 25 percent more viscous at 20°C than at 30°C, and a variation in temperature of one degree Celsius, in this [...] "room temperature" [...] range, produces a change of viscosity of about two percent. Therefore, a water clock with such a nozzle that keeps good time at some given temperature would gain or lose about half an hour per day if it were one degree Celsius warmer or cooler. To make it keep time within one minute per day would require its temperature to be controlled within °C (about ° Fahrenheit). There is no evidence that this was done in antiquity, so ancient water clocks with sufficiently thin and long nozzles (unlike the modern pendulum-controlled one described above) cannot have been reliably accurate by modern standards. [...] Note, however, that while modern timepieces may not be reset for long periods, water clocks were likely reset every day, when refilled, based on a sundial, so the <b>cumulative</b> <b>error</b> would not have been great.|$|E

50|$|A {{familiar}} {{example of}} feedback control is cruise control on an automobile. Here speed is the measured variable. The operator (driver) adjusts the desired speed set point (e.g. 100 km/hr) and the controller monitors the speed sensor and compares {{the measured speed}} to the set point. Any deviations, such as changes in grade, drag, wind speed or even using a different grade of fuel (for example an ethanol blend) are corrected by the controller making a compensating adjustment to the fuel valve open position, which is the manipulated variable. The controller makes adjustments having information only about the error (magnitude, rate of change or <b>cumulative</b> <b>error)</b> although adjustments known as tuning are used to achieve stable control.

Heyl and Briggs were awarded the Magellan Medal of the American Philosophical Society {{for this work}} in 1922.

5000|$|However, some of {{the biblical}} cross {{references}} {{did not seem to}} match, so that a reign which is said to have lasted for 20 years results in a cross reference that would give a result of either 19 or 21 years. Thiele noticed that the cross references given during the long reign of King Asa of Judah had a <b>cumulative</b> <b>error</b> of 1 year for each succeeding reign of the kings of Israel: the first cross-reference resulted in an error of 1 year, the second gave an error of 2 years, the third of 3 years and so on.

Under the accession year method, if a king died {{in the middle of a}} year, the period to the end of that year would be called the [...] "accession year" [...] and Year 1 of the new king's reign would begin at the new year. Under the non-accession year method the period to the end of the year would be Year 1 of the new king and Year 2 would begin at the start of the new year.

5000|$|The {{second source}} is the error on the {{analysis}} of the gas mix components. A typical field GC will have at best (under ideal conditions and frequent calibration) ~2% (of range) error in the quantity of each gas analyzed. Since the range for most field-GCs for C6 components is 0-1 mol%, there will be about 0.02 mol% uncertainty in the quantity of C6+ components. While this error does not change the heating value by much, it will introduce a significant error in the HCDP determination. Furthermore, since the exact distribution of C6+ components is an unknown (the amount of C6, C7, C8, ...), this further introduces additional errors in any HCDP calculations. When using a C6+ GC these errors can be as high as 100 °F or more, depending on the gas mixture and the assumptions made regarding the composition of the C6+ fraction. For [...] "pipeline quality" [...] natural gas, a C9+ GC analysis may reduce the uncertainty, because it eliminates the C6-C8 distribution error. However, independent {{studies have shown that the}} <b>cumulative</b> <b>error</b> can still be very significant, in some cases in excess of 30 C. A laboratory C12+ GC analysis using an Flame Ionization Detector (FID) can reduce the error further. However, using a C12 laboratory system can introduce additional errors, namely sampling error. If the gas has to be collected in a sample bottle and shipped to a laboratory for C12 analysis, sampling errors can be significant. Obviously there is also a lag time error between the time the sample was collected and the time it was analyzed.|$|E
