50|$|Buss {{suggests}} that the Hunting hypothesis also explains the advent of strong male coalitions. Although chimpanzees form male-male coalitions, {{they tend to be}} temporary opportunistic. Contrastingly, large game hunters require consistent and coordinated cooperation to succeed in large game hunting. Thus male coalitions were the result of working together to succeed in providing meat for the hunters themselves and their families. Kristen Hawkes suggests further that obtaining resources intended for <b>community</b> <b>consumption</b> increases a male’s fitness by appealing to the male’s society and thus being in the good favor of both males and females. The male relationship would improve hunting success and create alliances for future conflict and the female relationship would improve direct reproductive success. Buss proposes alternate explanations of emergence of the strong male coalitions. He {{suggests that}} male coalitions may have been the result of group-on-group aggression, defense, and in-group political alliances. This explanation does not support the relationship between male coalitions and hunting.|$|E
50|$|The MPC {{is higher}} {{in the case of}} poorer people than in rich. When a person earns a higher income, the cost of their basic human needs amount to a smaller {{fraction}} of this income, and correspondingly their average propensity to save is higher than that of a person with a lower income. The marginal propensity to save of the richer classes is greater than that of the poorer classes. If, at any time, it is desired to increase aggregate consumption, then the purchasing power should be transferred from the richer classes (with low propensity to consume) to the poorer classes (with a higher propensity to consume). Likewise, if it is desired to reduce <b>community</b> <b>consumption,</b> the purchasing power must be taken away from the poorer classes by taxing consumption. The marginal propensity to consume {{is higher in}} a poor country and lower in the case of rich country. The reason is same as stated above. In the case of rich country, most common of the basic needs of the people have already been satisfied, and all the additional increments of income are saved, resulting in a higher marginal propensity to save but in a lower marginal propensity to consume. In a poor country, on the other hand, most of the basic needs of the people remain unsatisfied so that additional increments of income go to increase consumption, resulting in a higher marginal propensity to consume and a lower marginal propensity to save. This is the reason MPC is higher in the underdeveloped countries of Asia and Africa, and lower in developed countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Germany.|$|E

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} to 14 antimicrobial agents and {{the mechanisms of}} aminopenicillin resistance were studied in 197 clinical isolates of Haemophilus influenzae— 109 isolated in 2007 (study group) and 88 isolated in 1997 (control group). Community antibiotic consumption trends were also examined. H. influenzae strains were consecutively isolated from the same geographic area, mostly from respiratory specimens from children and adults. Overall, amoxicillin resistance decreased by 8. 4 % (from 38. 6 to 30. 2 %). β-Lactamase production decreased by 15. 6 % (from 33 to 17. 4 %, P = 0. 01), but amoxicillin resistance without β-lactamase production increased by 7. 1 % (from 5. 7 to 12. 8 %). All β-lactamase-positive isolates were TEM- 1, but five different promoter regions were identified, with Pdel being the most prevalent in both years, and Prpt being associated with the highest amoxicillin resistance. A new promoter consisting of a double repeat of 54 bp was detected. <b>Community</b> <b>consumption</b> of most antibiotics decreased, as did the geometric means of their MICs, but amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and azithromycin consumption increased by ca. 60 %. For amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, a 14. 2 % increase in the population with an MIC of 2 to 4 μg/ml (P = 0. 02) was observed; for azithromycin, a 21. 2 % increase in the population with an MIC of 2 to 8 μg/ml (P = 0. 0005) was observed.

40|$|The food webs {{for three}} Sri Lankan reservoirs, Minneriya (ancient and shallow), Udawalawe (young and shallow) and Victoria (young and deep), were compared. The species {{richness}} of the fish communities was highest in Minneriya (30 species), intermediate in Udawalawe (21 species) and lowest in Victoria (18 species). The fish species belonged to 11 families, with Cyprinidae dominating the community {{in terms of both}} abundance and species richness. The daily quantity of food consumed per fish species was used to distinguish weak from strong trophic interactions in these food webs. The fish <b>community</b> <b>consumption</b> pattern was characterized by a few strong interactions and many weak ones. The number of major consumers (i. e. contributing > 5 % of the total fish <b>community</b> <b>consumption)</b> for each reservoir was small and similar for all three reservoirs. Dawkinsia singhala and Amblypharyngodon melettinus were the two major consumers in all three reservoir food webs. Puntius chola was a major consumer in Minneriya and Victoria, although not in Udawalawe, where it fed less on detritus than for the other two food webs. The fish community fed mainly {{at the bottom of the}} food web, primarily on algae, macrophytes and detritus in all three reservoirs, with very little piscivory occurring. The average food-web length was measured as the mean trophic index weighted for the consumption rates of the various fish populations that together comprised the fish community. The average food-web length in these three Sri Lankan reservoirs relatively short, compared with most other tropical lake/reservoir food webs in Asia and Africa for which relevant data were available. Furthermore, traditionally unexploited species (Oreochromis mossambicus; O. niloticus), in contrast to species of commercial fisheries interest, are major role players in the trophic dynamics of reservoir ecosystems. Thus, based on this study, the potential of their exploitation should be considered in the management of reservoir fisheries. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the case for}} the analysis of tourism, power and place in the development process from a critical sociological perspective. It draws on recent trends in the sociology of development to develop existing theoretical models in a manner which transcends the more rigid dualisms between structure and agency on the one hand, and, the concerns of power and identity on the other. As in recent works from noted scholars such as Picard and Wood (1997), the relationship between tourism and processes of development and social transformation are more nuanced and varied than previous 'theo-retical' models in tourism have recognised. Hence, this paper examines the issue by considering four major thematic areas of relevance to the study of tourism and its diverse relationships to processes of social change: the relations of <b>community,</b> <b>consumption,</b> production and plac...|$|E
40|$|Communal {{consumption}} {{has lately}} received abundant research attention. Nevertheless, <b>consumption</b> <b>community</b> management {{has not been}} studied very widely in the discipline of marketing. In particular, {{there are very few}} community management studies that examine the phenomenon {{from the perspective of the}} community supplier. Because the present study adopts this scantily studied perspective, it employs an abductive research approach. In order to give much emphasis on the empirical data, the researcher did not use any specific preselected theoretical framework to classify the findings. However, existing <b>consumption</b> <b>community</b> literature was broadly examined to create preliminary understanding, to provide theoretical background information and to support the researcher's interpretation. The previous community management theory often underlines how difficult, if not impossible, it is to control communities consisting of autonomous actors. Despite this, suppliers cannot settle for the role of a passive onlooker. Since <b>consumption</b> <b>communities</b> can provide substantial commercial and even strategic benefits to suppliers, suppliers must find alternative ways to manage those communities. Therefore, this study aims to specify the role of the supplier in the <b>consumption</b> <b>community</b> as well as analyze how the <b>consumption</b> <b>communities</b> can actually be managed. In this study, <b>consumption</b> <b>communities</b> are seen as heterogeneous social networks that express communality in manifold ways. Altogether five representatives of three successful community suppliers were interviewed. In addition to the depth interviews, a post-review seminar was organized to enrich the empirical data. In the post-review seminar six experts of community management discussed the findings of the analysis in order to verify and enhance researcher's interpretation. Based on the major findings, a framework for <b>consumption</b> <b>community</b> management from the supplier perspective was created. First, the framework summarizes the role of the supplier. Both previous literature and the empirical findings indicate that in the <b>consumption</b> <b>community</b> the role of the supplier is above all a facilitator. This research indicates that the supplier that operates in this facilitative role can manage <b>consumption</b> <b>communities</b> by implementing twelve actions that can be further divided into six action categories. Due to its data driven nature the formed framework provides both theoretical contribution and managerial implications...|$|R

The {{consumption}} of adult euphausiids was estimated {{for the seven}} most abundant fish species found on the continental shelf off southwestern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Empirical data on fish feeding rates, diets and biomass were used to estimate euphausiid consump-tion in August for each year from 1985 to 1997. The fish community in August was estimated to consume an average 297 kt of euphausiids (124 t km– 2). Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) and Pacific herring (Clupea harengus) accounted for 60 % and 30 %, respectively, of the total euphausiids consumed by fish. The total estimated {{consumption of}} euphausiids per tonne of fish averaged 0. 93, {{and there was no}} significant trend in the time series. In addition, there was no significant relationship between the total fish <b>community</b> <b>consumption</b> or euphausiids consumed per tonne of fish and euphausiid biomass, and there was no change in the fraction of euphausiids in the diet of small or large Pacific hake.
