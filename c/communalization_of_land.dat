Although China, Japan, Korea and other countries have great differences in political systems and ideology, they still enjoy something quite common in social behaviors—concept structures. Hence, one preliminary conclusion can be drawn: the seemingly huge political and ideological differences and the obstacles brought in thereof could be rather superficial in fact, {{so that they can}} be easily changed; however, the social behaviors—concepts infiltrated in people’s daily lifestyles seem not so important, but they are critical factors in the long-term evolution of society, and even play a decisive role.

To be specific, it is unable to figure out if the positive reasons prevail over the negative ones. To carry out corresponding predictions, comprehensive and in-depth research should be made.|$|R
30|$|Another {{viewpoint}} of Huntington is “international organizations”: the international organizations established {{on the basis}} of the cultural commonality between different countries, such as the EU which is far more successful than other international organizations that attempt to surmount culture. 17 In fact, classical examples in regard to Huntington’s civilization circle and core country theories are precisely the Chinese civilization circle and the European alignment. The integration and <b>communalization</b> <b>of</b> East Asia is conceptually not only a design of modern people, as it also existed in the imagination of ancient people. For example, the “heaven” concept in Confucianism firstly contains East Asia, and of course, Vietnam. The so-called “tribute system” is just an embodiment of this concept. In this sense, this {{viewpoint of}} Huntington is not original with regard to the historical origin of concepts and political practices, but it are unique in the numerous and complicated contemporary international relations and world situations.|$|R
30|$|Two {{viewpoints}} in The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order of S. P. Huntington (1927 - 2008) {{can well}} {{help us understand}} and analyze {{the composition of the}} integration and <b>communalization</b> <b>of</b> East Asia. The first viewpoint “core countries” was mentioned when he discussed the structure of civilization. 11 Huntington considered that core countries in the same civilization circle were the sources for the internal order within the region 12, and they had the ability to work with the countries with similar cultures to reject the countries with different cultures 13, and they also had the legitimacy to maintain and intensify orders and even {{to take the lead in}} the same civilization circle. 14 This theory of Huntington, which was made from a perspective of long period and international area, well explained the facts of world sphere of influence and order for that time and present. However, when various factors are incorporated, the universal significance of core countries calls for investigation in various actual relations, rather than being generally valid.|$|R
30|$|The {{integration}} of East Asia and {{establishment of a}} community between different countries is bound to require significant innovation in the nature and form of each country. Such integration and communalization will bring about a certain new framework or structure. One point {{should be noted that}} innovation should be a development process towards such a structure, as well as a gradual formation process of new structures via exploration and adjustment. The basic motivation for the integration and <b>communalization</b> <b>of</b> East Asia is bound to be from economy 9, while the motivation of economic cooperation—including people’s exchanges—when entering a certain phase, will inevitably lead to great reforms in political systems and adjustment of people’s mentality. The conflicts between political systems and mental contradictions of people will inevitably hinder the effective running of economic motive force. People cannot imagine the exact order of the reforms and adjustment, but it is necessary for them to reach a consensus about the most basic concepts, principles and historical problems. However, such consistency is just the periodical result of the whole integration process, neither its precondition nor its final target.|$|R
30|$|Secondly, the {{negative}} reasons: (1) the differences of {{political system and}} ideology, especially the peculiarity of China’s political system and ideology; (2) the historical problems—they are big obstacles as far as mentality is concerned, as historical memories are hard to vanish; (3) the distrust and hatred between people; (4) the differences in country scale; (5) the incomplete unification between China and Korea (North Korea); (6) China or Japan respectively maintains a better relationship with the Southeast Asian countries. In these six points, the 1 st one is the foremost obstacle that is most difficult to overcome and regarded as a dangerous road. The 2 nd one lasts {{for a longer period}} and is more difficult to overcome, but people’s emotions can be calmed downed via political and social adjustments. The 3 rd one, though suggesting the important manner, collides with the close exchanges between people. What is the mainstream? The 4 th one is a situation that the EU does not encounter yet (though the EU contains countries of different sizes, but its core countries are similar in size); it is easy to rise up and become a big obstacle. As for the 5 th one, people may even consider that the integration and <b>communalization</b> <b>of</b> East Asia serves as a sound means for the solution of national division.|$|R

They assert that there is nothing natural about the gendered division of labor and show that the expectation that women perform all or most reproductive labor, i.e., labor associated with birthing and raising children but also the cleaning, cooking, and other tasks necessary to support human life, deny women the capacity to participate fully in economic activity outside the home. In order to free themselves from the conditions of work as a mother and housekeeper, socialist feminists such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman saw the professionalization of housework as key. This would be done by hiring professional nannies and housekeepers to take the load of domestic work away from the woman in the house.Perkins Gilman also recommended the redesign of homes in ways that would maximize their potential for creativity and leisure for women as well as men, i.e., emphasizing the need for rooms like studios and studies and eliminating kitchens and dining rooms. These changes would necessitate the <b>communalization</b> <b>of</b> meal preparation and consumption outside the home and free women from their burden of providing meals on a house-by-house scale.|$|R
40|$|I {{present in}} this paper the Punjab crisis until {{operation}} Blue Star {{as a case study}} of failed ne-gotiations and analyze it using the tools provided by negotiation theory. According to its main authors, (Fisher, Ury, Patton, Cohen and Pfetsch) everything is negotiable if negotiations are properly led. Why did the Central Government of Indira Gandhi fail to come to an agreement with the Akali Dal Party? The theoretical analysis of the negotiation process shows that negotiations were not conducted properly. If it had been the case however, would an agreement truly have been reached? I argue that all Akali demands could have been handled if the requirements of the model of "principled negotiations" had been fulfilled, and if the parties had followed Cohen's recommendations on cross-cultural negotiations to improve their mutual understanding. The negotiations failed be-cause they were polluted by electoral politics and by the consideration of party interests, resulting in the <b>communalization</b> <b>of</b> the Punjab-Sikh issue. Studying the Punjab case allows however to point out certain limitations of negotiation theory, mainly the static nature of its assumptions and its inability {{to deal with the problem}} of negotiating in a context of violence, which leads me to the conclusion that negotiation theory should be further developed in a more multidisciplinary perspective to overcome its defects.

40|$|The {{land rent}} {{is one of}} many factors that {{influences}} the socialization <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> Manifestations <b>of</b> the <b>land</b> rent through the amount of the rent-charge and the price <b>of</b> <b>land</b> are very important for the socialization <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> The large amount of the rent-charge influences negatively the development of social renting and. social purchase <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> In regions where the amount of the rentcharge is large the conditions for the development of social renting are less favourable, because social agricultural holdings have no economic interest for renting. As in these regions, as a rule, the prices <b>of</b> <b>land</b> are also high the conditions for socialization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> by purchase <b>of</b> <b>land</b> from individual owners are not favourable too. This conclusion results from the negative correlation between the social renting and the amount of rent-charge (index of correlation: 0. 21443), and the negative correlation between the social purchase <b>of</b> <b>land</b> and the amount of the rent-charge (index of correlation: 0. 19005). Though the amount of the rent-charge is not identical with the real value <b>of</b> <b>land</b> rent because the first almost entirely depends on the supply and demand 2 ̆ 7 <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> stated correlations indicate that the large amount of the rent-charge negatively influences the socialization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> by renting and purchase <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> The negative influence <b>of</b> the <b>land</b> rent on socialization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> manifests itself also through the negative influence of high prices <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> The correlation between socialization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> and the high prices <b>of</b> <b>land</b> is negative (coefficient of correlation- 0. 180041, index: 0. 34380). But the price <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> in conditions <b>of</b> the domination of small peasants’ holdings, is not always identical with the capitalized land rent. It mostly depends on the supply and. demand <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> and therefore it appears that the negative influence of the large amount of the rent-charge on socialization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> through purchase <b>of</b> <b>land</b> is not always sufficiently expressed. In agrarian overpopulated regions the price <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> as a rule, is considerably higher than the capitalized land rent. In our conditions the demand <b>of</b> <b>land</b> in the interpeasants 2 ̆ 7 buying. and selling <b>of</b> <b>land</b> has a tendency of decrease, while the supply <b>of</b> <b>land</b> for sale has the tendency of increase due to the employment of rural population out of their holdings. So the supply <b>of</b> <b>land</b> from individual holdings and the demand <b>of</b> <b>land</b> from social holdings have become the important regulator of prices, especially in grain-growing regions. On the base <b>of</b> the <b>land</b> rent realized by the social holdings economical criteria in socialization <b>of</b> <b>land</b> by purchase <b>of</b> <b>land</b> can be established. The amount of the rent-charge can be a source of means for paying the price <b>of</b> <b>land</b> and can considerably influence not only the price <b>of</b> <b>land</b> but also the orientation of agricultural organizations towards purchase <b>of</b> more fertile <b>land</b> which can bring the larger land rent...|$|R

40|$|The {{concern of}} this {{research}} {{is the nature of the}} Hindu nationalist ideology in the western Indian state of Gujarat from 1880 to 1950 since this period is crucial in forging a relationship between Hindu and Muslim communities based on mutual suspicion. The attempt is to shed light on the way a fundamentalist ideology is configured in increasingly exclusivist terms whereby minorities in the subcontinent were gradually granted a marginal citizenship subordinated to a Hindu cultural mainstream. The deconstruction of the nationalistic discourses of some representative individual figures and groups -the Arya Samaj, the Hindu Mahasabha, K. M. Munshi and Vallabhbhai Patel- allowed unravelling a trajectory of this ideology identifying its major fluctuations. The focus on Gujarati nationalism of Hindu tradition as opposed to a rather exceptional Gandhian nationalism and its commitment to non-violence made possible to explain the current political culture in India nowadays that inherited the legacy of the agitational politics of those years. Along with the historiographical analysis of these discourses, the research explores the mobilizational strategies accompanying the ideological dimension. The political campaigns of these actors were fundamental in spreading a communal consciousness that enabled a history of perennial confrontation between Hindus and Muslims, an aspect whose origin can be traced in the colonial historiography on India. In this sense, the research aims not only at being a contribution to the academic debate on the formation of a national consciousness in Gujarat, but also attempts to elucidate the motivations behind communal violence grounded on the circulation of stereotypes and their exploitation. The study contributes to the understanding of contemporary violence as a result <b>of</b> a gradual <b>communalization</b> <b>of</b> politics and daily life that imbibes from the distortion of the historical paradigms that by the end of the nineteenth century still coped with multiculturalism. ...|$|R
