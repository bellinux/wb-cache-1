40|$|Sometimes, the carrier, {{in order}} to {{accomplish}} the task of moving goods to its destination, he appeals to other carriers, for various reasons, concluding another contract of carriage, whichcircumscribes the initial contract and it entrusts the achievement of the entire transportation or only a part of it. Sometimes, there are precise stipulations in the main contract of carriage concerning thisissue. Besides the movement of goods, which we may call traditional, defined as using means of transportation of the same kind, lately we can observe the proliferation of more complex operations, which have the generic name of successive transportation. In such shipments, the multimodal transport plays an important role. Thus, the present approach focuses on some features of the legal relationships which may arise between the <b>contracting</b> <b>carrier,</b> surrogate carrier, consignor and consignee, and also on the results from the analysis of the concerned international conventions...|$|E
40|$|Recognised as an {{excellent}} tool for {{competition in the}} current liberalised framework of international air transport, code-sharing is becoming a common practice, {{as an integral part}} of the activity of an airline, with obvious implications for both airlines and passengers. This thesis presents two predominant legal implications of such a practice, involving two carriers for a single flight: the <b>contracting</b> <b>carrier</b> and the operating carrier. First, this study aims at examining the relationship between users/passengers and code-share partners, more particularly identifying the practice as misleading due to the non-disclosure of the actual operator of the flight, which is magnified by the inaccuracy and shortcomings of computerised reservation systems (CRS). The regulatory framework in this regard is described and the legal obligation to disclose the identity of the actual carrier is given top priority. The delimitation of operational responsibilities will also be addressed (inadmissible passengers, overbooking and baggage concerns). The private agreement between the code-share partners will be given importance in ascertaining the liability issues. Second, the current international liability regime is analysed with a view to consider the code-sharing scenario. The potential conflict between the different international legal regimes governing air carriers' liability is highlighted in order that this aspect be taken into account by the code-share partners in their contractual agreement. Last but not least, some provisions of the new Montreal Convention of 28 May 1999 will be examined. A closer look will be given specifically to those provisions of Chapter V that are particularly applicable to a code-sharing situation...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Import and Export Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005 In the South African law of {{carriage}} by air, {{different rules}} apply {{according to whether}} the carriage is (1) international carriage to which the Carriage by Air Act 17 of 1946 applies, or (2) either international carriage to which that Act does not apply, or purely domestic carriage, that is performed wholly within {{the borders of the}} Republic. International carriage not falling under (1) above, and purely domestic carriage, are governed by the common law except {{to the extent that the}} rule of the common law have been modified by agreement by the conditions of carriage of the individual carrier concerned. However, international carriage under (1) above is governed partly by the rules of certain international conventions which have been incorporated by legislation into our domestic law, and partly by agreements between intentional air carriers. The following international instruments and agreements have a bearing on this class of international carriage: (a) the Warsaw Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, dating form 1929, which firmly established and elaborated, as one of its major tenets, the principle of the air carrier's liability for damage caused to passengers, baggage and goods, and also for damage caused by delay; (b) the Hague Protocol of 1955. It was added to the Warsaw Convention with the aim of adapting it to the demands of modem transport; (c) the Guadalajara Convention of 1961 for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air Performed by a Person Other than the <b>Contracting</b> <b>Carrier.</b> This amendment took the form of a Supplementary Convention because it was concluded to deal with an entirely new subject-matter, namely chartering; (d) the Montreal Agreement, an agreement subscribed to by a number of international air carriers whereby the participating carriers voluntarily undertake to assume a more extensive liability for passenger death or injury occurring on international journeys to, from, or via the United States of America, than that which they would have been subject under the Warsaw Convention as amended by the Hague Protocol. As seen above, the Warsaw Convention became the first international legal instrument to establish the principles of liability related to carriage by air. However, the Warsaw Convention has proved insufficient for the requirements of rapid-developing air transport and travel, and as aviation began expanding on a large scale, the Warsaw Convention had to be amended. These amendments however, present problems since some States are only a member to the Warsaw Convention and others are members to both the Warsaw Convention and all its amendments. This in effect means that the unamended and amended conventions co-exist. As a result, the amount of limited liability or compensation for damages caused by aircraft accidents in the Warsaw is controversial and questionable, and no longer provides a uniform body of legal rules. The answer to the inherent flaws of the Warsaw regime is the Montreal Convention of 1999. This Convention evolved from the original Warsaw Convention, but is now no longer a convention for carriers. It is a convention for consumers/passengers. The Montreal Convention aims to modernise the liability regime, to consolidate the Warsaw Convention and related instruments, to ensure orderly development of international air transport operations, and to, once again, ensure uniformity and universality. The Montreal Convention however, will only come into force after 30 countries have ratified it. Since only one country has currently ratified the Convention, it can still take a few years before uniformity is restored. This however does not stop South Africa from following in the footsteps of the European Union by the promulgation of legislation which would give the Montreal Convention immediate effect in South Africa as soon as the Convention came into force.
