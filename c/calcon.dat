40|$|HERE ARE MANY TECHNICS and {{procedures}} {{used for the}} determina-tion of calcium and magnesium in blood serum but more rapid and accurate methods would be of great value. Complexometric titrations using disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) as titrant and metal indicators were proposed {{for the analysis of}} Ca or Mg, or both. Elliot (1) described the direct titration of calcium with EDTA using murexide as indicator; however, this indicator is unstable and has a poor visual end point. Andersch (2) used calcein for the determina-tion of Ca. Gobby, Hildebrand, and Reffley (3) used a recently re-ported indicator, <b>Calcon</b> (4), for the direct titration of Ca. However, they report some difficulty in the exact location of the end point. These methods are less time consuming than the widely used method of Clark and Coup (5). However, they have the disadvantage of the rather difficult and/or indistinct end-point detection. It was recently shown by Malmstadt and Hadjiioannou (6) that Ca and Mg in dolomites and limestones can be determined rapidly and accurately by an automatic derivative spectrophotometric titra-tion procedure using EDTA as titrant. The same general automatic procedure is well suited for the determination of Ca and Mg in blood serum, as shown by the results presented here. The method is accurate and satisfies the clinician’s demand for speed of determination. The Ca is determined in an aliquot of the diluted deproteinized serum sample by adjusting the pH to about 13 with NaOH to precipitate the Mg, adding <b>Calcon</b> indicator, inserting the beaker into the titrator, pressing the start button, and reading the buret after the titration is automatically terminated at the en...|$|E

Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray scattering, and light scattering were used to study the dye assembling structures and the pH-induced volume phase transitions of the composite microgels. The UV-vis absorption. and photoluminescence properties of the composite microgels were respectively investigated at different pH values and H 2 O 2 concentrations. The pH-induced shrinkage of the template microgels not only results in a systematic shift in the wavelength of bands, but also significantly increases the absorption and emission intensity. The composite microgels also exhibit a highly H 2 O 2 -sensitive fluorescence quenching.

NOAA/NESDIS, in collaboration with USGS, used the Robotic Lunar Observatory (ROLO) model to examine the GOES- 10 Imager visible channel calibration degradation in early 2006. A total of 33 suitable lunar observations at various phase angles had been collected over the eight years of GOES- 10 Imager operational period between July 1998 and June 2006. The relative calibration accuracy with lunar calibration was about 3 %, comparable {{with the results of}} other vicarious calibration methods conducted at NOAA/NESDIS.

In this method, Fe(II) sensitively and selectively reacts with <b>Calcon</b> carboxylic acid (CCA) in presence of cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) yielding a hydrophobic complex at pH 10. 5, which is then entrapped in surfactant-rich phase. Total Fe was accurately and reliably determined after the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) with sulfite. The amount of Fe(III) in samples was determined from the difference between total Fe and Fe(II). CPC was used not only as an auxiliary ligand in CPE, but also as sensitivity enhancement agent in FAAS. The nonionic surfactant, polyethylene glycol tert-octylphenyl ether (Triton X- 114) was used as an extracting agent. The analytical variables affecting CPE efficiency were investigated in detail. The preconcentration/enhancement factors of 50 and 82 respectively, were obtained for the preconcentration of Fe(II) with 50 mL solution. Under the optimized conditions, the detection limit of Fe(II) in linear range of 0. 2 - 60 μg L- 1 was 0. 06 μg L- 1.

Last year at <b>CALCON</b> we presented the preliminary results of this project and showed that an electronics control system that was made of COTS components could be used for optical power measurements down to a noise floor of ~ 16 pW.

40|$|The Belgian-ESA Proba-V(egetation) {{satellite}} is to {{be launched}} in April 2013. The aim of the Proba-V mission is to ensure data product continuity with SPOT-VEGETATION, which ends its operations in 2014. While developed {{in the frame of}} ESA’s In Orbit Demonstration (IOD) technological program, Proba-V is an operational mission providing the user community daily with global land coverage data in four multispectral bands at both 1 / 3 km and 1 km resolution. This user community requires reliable and consistent measurements over time in order to detect and quantify changes in the Earth’s environment. To this end, the radiometric calibration requirements for PROBA-V specify 5 % absolute and 3 % relative accuracies. To guarantee this high quality over the full lifetime of PROBA-V, in-flight calibration algorithms have to be in place which fully consider the specific properties of the PROBA-V platform and its instrument design characteristics. Due to size, weight and power constraints, no onboard calibration devices are available. Therefore the PROBA-V in-flight radiometric calibration has to rely solely on vicarious calibration methods. The radiometric calibration after launch will be performed by the PROBA-V Image Quality Center (IQC) located at VITO. To this end, VITO developed the Optical Sensor Calibration with simulated Radiance (OSCAR) facility. It will be used for the vicarious calibration activities of PROBA-V. OSCAR encompasses various calibration methods based on the exploitation of reﬂected radiance by clouds, atmospheric molecules, sun glint and bright desert surfaces. It achieves its calibration results through a combination of the results of these methods. The consistency with SPOT-VGT, essential for a continuity mission, will be verified through inter-calibration over stable desert sites. The vicarious calibration methods implemented in the OSCAR facility have been throughout tested and validated on various satellite data and detailed error assessments have been performed. These analyses showed that the mission requirement specifications for the radiometric calibration are realistic achievable goals. The Cal/Val commissioning phase will start after the platform and instrument verification and validation phase and is scheduled to be a three-month activity, running in the summer months of 2013. At the <b>Calcon</b> 2013 conference, the Cal/Val activitity will be ongoing.
