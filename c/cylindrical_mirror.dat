The lenses are {{placed at a distance}} [...] from each other (they act as a 1:1 telescope), and at a distance [...] from the gratings. If , the setup acts as a positive-dispersion stretcher and if , it is a negative-dispersion stretcher. And the case [...] is used in the pulse shaper. Usually, the focusing element is a spherical or <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mirror</b> rather than a lens. As with the configuration in Figure 1, it is possible to use an additional mirror and use a single grating rather than two separate ones. This setup requires that the beam diameter is very small compared to the length of the telescope; otherwise undesirable aberrations will be introduced. For this reason, it is normally used as a stretcher before the amplification stage, since the low-intensity seed pulses can be collimated to a beam with a small diameter.|$|E
60|$|Secondly, Another fault {{which makes}} our ideas {{confused}} is, when, though the particulars {{that make up}} any idea are in number enough, yet they are so jumbled together, {{that it is not}} easily discernible whether it more belongs to the name that is given it than to any other. There is nothing properer to make us conceive this confusion than a sort of pictures, usually shown as surprising pieces of art, wherein the colours, as they are laid by the pencil on the table itself, mark out very odd and unusual figures, and have no discernible order in their position. This draught, thus made up of parts wherein no symmetry nor order appears, is in itself no more a confused thing, than the picture of a cloudy sky; wherein, though there be as little order of colours or figures to be found, yet nobody thinks it a confused picture. What is it, then, that makes it be thought confused, since the want of symmetry does not? As it is plain it does not: for another draught made barely in imitation of this could not be called confused. I answer, That which makes it be thought confused is, the applying it to some name to which it does no more discernibly belong than to some other: v.g. when it {{is said to be the}} picture of a man, or Caesar, then any one with reason counts it confused; because it is not discernible in that state to belong more to the name man, or Caesar, than to the name baboon, or Pompey: which are supposed to stand for different ideas from those signified by man, or Caesar. But when a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mirror,</b> placed right, had reduced those irregular lines on the table into their due order and proportion, then the confusion ceases, and the eye presently sees that it is a man, or Caesar; i.e. that it belongs to those names; and that it is sufficiently distinguishable from a baboon, or Pompey; i.e. from the ideas signified by those names. Just thus it is with our ideas, which are as it were the pictures of things. No one of these mental draughts, however the parts are put together, can be called confused (for they are plainly discernible as they are) till it be ranked under some ordinary name to which it cannot be discerned to belong, any more than it does to some other name of an allowed different signification.|$|E

50|$|Similarly, if a {{light source}} is placed at one focus of an {{elliptic}} mirror, all light rays {{on the plane}} of the ellipse are reflected to the second focus. Since no other smooth curve has such a property, it can be used as an alternative definition of an ellipse. (In the special case of a circle with a source at its center all light would be reflected back to the center.) If the ellipse is rotated along its major axis to produce an ellipsoidal mirror (specifically, a prolate spheroid), this property holds for all rays out of the source. Alternatively, a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mirror</b> with elliptical cross-section can be used to focus light from a linear fluorescent lamp along a line of the paper; such mirrors are used in some document scanners.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{relevant}} information, in photoemission spectroscopy, {{is contained in}} the kinetic energy distribution of the photoelectrons, a specific device is needed to energy-filter the electrons emitted (or scattered) by the sample.Electrostatic monochromators {{are the most common}} choice. The older design, a CMA, represents a trade-off between the need for high count rates and high angular/energy resolution. The so-called <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mirror</b> analyser (CMA) is mostly used for checking the elemental composition of the surface.It consists of two co-axial cylinders placed in front of the sample, the inner one being held at a positive potential, while the outer cylinder is held at a negative potential.Only the electrons with the right energy can pass through this set-up and are detected at the end. The count rates are high but the resolution (both in energy and angle) is poor.|$|E
5000|$|Surface {{sensitivity}} in AES {{arises from}} the fact that emitted electrons usually have energies ranging from 50 eV to 3 keV and at these values, electrons have a short mean free path in a solid. The escape depth of electrons is therefore localized to within a few nanometers of the target surface, giving AES an extreme sensitivity to surface species. Because of the low energy of Auger electrons, most AES setups are run under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. Such measures prevent electron scattering off of residual gas atoms as well as the formation of a thin [...] "gas (adsorbate) layer" [...] {{on the surface of the}} specimen, which degrades analytical performance. A typical AES setup is shown schematically in figure 2. In this configuration, focused electrons are incident on a sample and emitted electrons are deflected into a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mirror</b> analyzer (CMA).

These higher energies were potentially available using higher energy monochromators than the Grasshopper. In 1987, with Bancroft now chair of the Chemistry department at UWO he planned for a new beamline to cover the 1500-400eV energy range. A successful application was made to the recently formed Ontario Centre for Materials Research, and T.K. Sham was hired away from Brookhaven National Laboratory to design the beamline.

40|$|Within {{the history}} of {{interactive}} video installations, there is a tradition of integrating the live image of the self: the screen as mirror, negotiating between pure reflection and (total) transformation. The installation Mirror Mirror engages with this tradition. It is an appropriation of cylindrical anamorphosis, a 17 th century technique in which a distorted image {{can be observed in}} its reconstituted form through reflection in a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mirror.</b> Cylindrical anamorphosis typically is a media setting in which the mirror is not used to look at oneself, and instead uses the phantasmagoric power of the mirror to reveal something that was hidden, intertwining the subversive and the magical. By implementing digital technology, the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mirror</b> can however also become a mirror that allows to observe oneself. A semi-transparent <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mirror</b> hides a video camera. The video-image of the observer approaching the mirror is captured and warped in real time—from a Cartesian to a near-polar coordinate system—and projected on a horizontally-placed screen. The reflection in the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mirror</b> reveals the reconstituted image of the observer. Warped projected image and reflected image are – literally – a mirror pair, a double face that offers an intriguing interplay of chaos and form. The <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mirror</b> acts as mediator that translates and folds warped projection into recognizable reflected form, and at the same time, re-injects some of its wild analogue magic into the digital apparatus. The reflected image, as of an apparition trapped inside a glass vessel, possesses a strange quality of three-dimensionality. Upon closer inspection, distortions {{at the edges of the}} reflected image unmask this three-dimensionality to be just an illusion. The reflection in the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mirror</b> does not belong to the same reality as the observer’s, at this side of the mirror. An incompossibility central to the lure of Mirror Mirror, and that invites to explore the mechanisms of this quasi-impossible telltale mirror, and of one’s own visual perception system. In our media-saturated world were digital processual images are becoming standard, cylindrical anamorphosis uses its own analogue and pre-digital processual power to re-inject uncontrolled magic and poetry into this techno-aesthetics. On the other hand by using moving images that are digitally manipulated, cylindrical anamorphosis is contaminated by the present and becomes a hybrid contemporary version of artificial magic. status: publishe...|$|E
