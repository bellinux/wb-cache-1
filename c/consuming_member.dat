40|$|Cannibalism {{refers to}} the action of <b>consuming</b> a <b>member</b> {{of the same species}} and is common in many taxa. This paper reviews the {{available}} literature on cannibalism in cephalopods. All species of the class Cephalopoda are predators and cannibalism is common in most species whose diet has been studied. Cannibalism in cephalopods is densitydependent due to their aggressive predatory and in case of the octopuses territorial nature. It also depends upon local and temporal food availability and of the reproductive season. Cannibalistic behaviour is positively related to the size of both cannibal and victim. It can affect population dynamics of cephalopods in periods of low food availability and/or high population abundance. Cephalopods are generally restricted in their ability to store energy. It is thus assumed that cannibalism is part of a population energy storage strategy enabling cephalopod populations to react to favourable and adverse environmental conditions by increasing and reducing their number. Finally, we propose five orientation points for future research on cannibalism in cephalopods. CM Ibáñez was supported by a CONICYT doctoral fellowship...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to justify special natural {{discount}} rates in the efficiency assessment of conservation activities. Nowadays, the social rate of discounting suggested by D.  Pearce is often used. However, many ecosystem values differ in such aspects as absence of high-grade anthropogenic substitutes and conservative character of natural “technologies”, and consequently simple, not expanded, reproduction. As a result, there exists the need for special discounting rate for non-replaceable production and services restricted in their reprocessing and consumption. This follows from the analysis of a consumer choice trajectory {{in the course of}} budget growth over a level at which the maximum of consumption of the limited good is reached. The paper estimates the reduction value for discounting rates for renewable natural resources restricted in regeneration in the special case of individual utility functions of the Cobb-Douglas type and, for a collective consumption, using equal-parts resource sharing among <b>consuming</b> community <b>members.</b> The idea of special discount rates for the production and non-material services of ecosystems is useful both for economic efficiency assessment of nature conservation activities and for calculation of compensations from the activities that adversely affect environment quality. </span...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the {{consumption}} of Lourdes, a Catholic pilgrimage site in France. Based on a three-year ethnography, our findings focus on respondents’ ‘Lourdes stories’. Discussing themes of faith, hope and love, we illustrate the importance of the family in <b>consuming</b> Lourdes. Family <b>members</b> act as influencing agents in the initial and sometimes continuous consumption of Lourdes. Our findings differ from consumer research to date in that rather than furthering discussion of family structure or furthering discussion on family identity we suggest a new focus is the actual building of intimate family bonds and relationships – the ‘doing’ of family or ‘familying’ – with the context of the Lourdes pilgrimage offering consumers a unique setting comprising faith, fun and family...|$|R
40|$|Most of our {{knowledge}} regarding the biodiversity of gut microbes comes from terrestrial organisms or marine species of economic value, with less emphasis on ecologically important species. Here we investigate the bacterial composition associated with the gut of Siganus fuscescens, a rabbitfish that plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by <b>consuming</b> seaweeds. <b>Members</b> of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and delta-Proteobacteria were among the dominant taxa across samples taken from the contents and the walls (sites) of the midgut and hindgut (location). Despite the high variability among individual fish, we observed statistically significant differences in beta-diversity between gut sites and gut locations. Some bacterial taxa low in abundance in the midgut content (e. g., Desulfovibrio) were found in greater abundances on the midgut wall and within the hindgut, suggesting that the gut may select for specific groups of environmental and/or food-associated microorganisms. In contrast, some distinct taxa present in the midgut content (e. g., Synechococcus) were noticeably reduced in the midgut wall and hindgut, and are thus likely to be representative of transient microbiota. This is the first assessment of the bacterial diversity associated with the gut of S. fuscescens and highlights the {{need to consider the}} variability across different gut locations and sites when analyzing fish gut microbiomes...|$|R
50|$|Humans collect {{several species}} of Russula for food. In the Pacific Northwest region of North America, only Russula brevipes parasitized with Hypomyces lactifluorum—known as lobster mushroom—is {{collected}} commercially. The tropical Chinese species Russula griseocarnea, misidentified as the European R. vinosa until 2009, is commercially collected as food and medicine. Russula is the most commonly consumed and economically important mushroom genus in Madagascar, particularly Russula prolifica and Russula edulis. This and other edible Russula are typically stripped of their cap cuticle before selling {{to make them more}} similar in appearance to the Agaricus bisporus. Several Russula species are sold in the markets of Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park (central Mexico): R. brevipes, R. cyanoxantha, R. mexicana and R. olivacea. In Tlaxcala, wild species sold in market include R. alutacea, R. cyanoxantha, R. delica, R. mariae, R. olivacea, R. romagnesia, and R. xerampelina. In Madagascar, species collected from introduced eucalypt forests include Russula madecassense, Russula prolifica, and several other species of minor importance, including some that have not yet been officially described. In Tanzania, Russula cellulata and Russula ciliata are sometimes used as food. Edible russulas in Nepal include Russula flavida and Russula chlorides. Russula cyanoxantha is a popular edible throughout Asia, Europe, and the Pacific. In Thailand, russulas collected by locals and sold in roadsides and local markets include Russula alboareolata, Russula lepida, Russula nigricans, Russula virescens, and Russula xerampelina. There is a cultural divide toward interpretation of Russula edibility. In general, North American field guides tend to list mostly non-edible species and advise caution when <b>consuming</b> any <b>member</b> of the genus. In contrast, European field guides have a more favorable opinion and list more edible species.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—With the low {{installation}} and maintenance cost of IEEE 802. 11 -based equipment, dense Wi-Fi deployments are a reality, especially in today’s urban areas. This vast number of WLANs can be exploited to achieve low-cost ubiquitous wireless Internet access, which is also demostrated {{by the emergence of}} community-based wireless access schemes. In our prior work we have developed a reciprocity-based peer-to-peer architecture for Wi-Fi sharing, where peers provide free Wi-Fi access to others in order to enjoy the same benefit when they are away from their own Wi-Fi network. Our system tries to match peer consumption with contribution and we have shown it to work well for city-scale Wi-Fi sharing communities. However, when attempting to roam outside the city boundaries, the statistics are such that there is typically a lack of consumption-contribution information between <b>consuming</b> and providing <b>members,</b> which hinders the system’s scalability. In this work, we extend our architecture with global-scale roaming capabilities by relaxing the requirement for full decentralization. In particular, we exploit special trusted super-peers which act as representatives of different Wi-Fi sharing communities (e. g., communities of different geographical regions) and which mediate transactions when there is insufficient information about peer contribution history. Extensive simulations show that this super-peer-assisted approach can significantly enhance the system’s performance in terms of roaming coverage. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper shall {{introduce}} a new phenomenon about consumption. This is related to consumption of characters like Mickey Mouse and Hello, Kitty. The phenomenon appears prominently in Japan. In order to examine consumption of characters and the strategies for creating characters, we conducted a case study {{on a set of}} marketing strategies of a toy manufacturer in Japan. Traditionally, consumption research is asserted using the uni-methodological paradigm. The uni-methodological paradigm here means that researchers have a methodological exclusiveness stance to any other research approaches. Hirschman and Holbrook (1992) distinguish five non-interchangeable research approaches on consumer research. For instance, from an economic point of view, consumption could be assumed as a problem solving method to increase utility. Baudrillard (1968, 1970) criticized this type of functional consumption. Researchers have often denied the other approaches competitive to their own approaches rather than incorporating them. Character consumption cannot be revealed by such an insulated research stance because consumers would like to consume characters for multidimensional reasons. They consume characters to enhance their utilities. In addition, characters stimulate consumers’ sentiments. The possession desire is satisfied by consuming characters. Possessing character goods can create small interest groups and stimulate communication among the group <b>members.</b> <b>Consuming</b> characters is assumed to involve multidimensional aspects: functional, conspicuous, and semiotic consumption. As a result, once we try to understand character consumption, we have to employ the multidisciplinary approach in contrast to the unimethodological paradigm. Through our case study, we revealed the distinctive marketing strategies in the business of characters. It is necessary for marketers of character goods to regard character consumption as having functional, conspicuous, and semiotic aspects. We can find distinctive characteristics in the market research, product development, advertising, and communication strategies in the process of creating characters...|$|R
40|$|Background: Awareness towards tobacco hazards has {{increased}} with time but its role alone towards cessation is questionable. With widespread menace of tobacco {{in developing countries}} like India, not much tobacco chewing prevalence and their quitting patterns data are available in urban Saurashtra region. Objectives: 1. To find out prevalence of various forms of chewing tobacco and quitting attitudes in urban Jamnagar. 2. To study quitting patterns in relation with age of habit initiation, family background and habit duration. Materials and Methods: It was a cross-sectional study involving 2513 individuals as study population by 30 -cluster sampling method. The study was carried out between June 2007 and March 2008. Pre-set, pre-tested questionnaire was used for interview purpose and the statistical analysis was done on proportion basis. Results: About 37. 2 &#x 0025; of study population was ever-tobacco-chewers; 32. 9 &#x 0025; of them were current-chewers and 4. 3 &#x 0025; were quitters. Approximately 28. 4 &#x 0025; of current-consumers were willing to quit. Mawa-masala (63. 7 &#x 0025;) and Gutka (57. 6 &#x 0025;) were preferred forms of chewing tobacco and 57. 5 &#x 0025; of the current-chewers chewed tobacco six to eight times a day. Tobacco initiation age between 20 and 30 years was commoner among quitters (84. 2 &#x 0025;), while a little younger in current-consumers (76. 5 &#x 0025;). About 58. 3 &#x 0025; quitters and 74. 0 &#x 0025; chewers showing willingness to quit had not consumed tobacco {{for more than five}} years, 63. 8 &#x 0025; of current-chewers had a family <b>member</b> <b>consuming</b> tobacco. With initiation of health problems, 72. 2 &#x 0025; subjects quit and 55. 5 &#x 0025; of them already knew about health hazards. Conclusions: Every 4 out of 10 residents was found to be exposed to chewing tobacco. With Mawa-masala and Gutka being the predominant forms, habit onset in late adolescence, years of consumption and family exposure seem to be hampering quitting. Awareness about tobacco hazards alone {{does not appear to be}} resulting in successful quitting...|$|R
40|$|Communication and {{information}} {{is a crucial}} part of conducting business operations in shipping. There is a constant interchange of communication {{and information}} between an operating vessel and the land based enterprises. The crews are getting smaller and the amount of administration and communication has increased with newer technology and legislation. This is a large workload, the administrative tasks and commutative responsibilities should not be overlooked. It is a well-known fact that this problem affects the on board personnel in terms of stress. Due to this elevated workload, it is sometimes required by the crew to prioritize tasks. As paperwork and administration tasks occasionally are time <b>consuming,</b> some crew <b>members</b> insists that more important matters are, for a time, set aside. The sheer amount of the communications and administration could also result in duplication of work. To achieve more efficient communication a mapping of the current communication and information flows to and from the ship to shore is in order, by researching what is sent, what information contains, what information is required, why it is sent. To improve these flows, an analysis is needed to discover redundant information and communication paths. This study is based on a scenario that consists an oil tanker or chemical tanker, transporting cargo to or from the port of Gothenburg, i. e. loading the cargo or discharging. Only the first link from the ship to shore and the information flow of commercial or legal variety is examined. Using a semi structured interview consisting of a fixed list with pre-determined questions in non-decisive order was conducted with Masters, asking about the procedures required to call the port of Gothenburg and their take on administrative work loads. The land organisations was also inquired to provide insight in to the calling process and thereby achieving triangulation. The result is a practical description of case describing the calling process and the Masters view of calling Gothenburg. They described the calling process to the port of Gothenburg to not being particularly burdensome but overall there is a constant pressure from the landside to perform and respond communicative wise. Other ports where mentioned as being significantly more burdensome...|$|R
40|$|This paper assesses {{long-term}} {{impacts of}} vegetable and polyculture fish production technologies {{on a variety}} of measures of household and individual well-being in Bangladesh. In 1996 – 1997, households were surveyed in three sites where nongovernmental organizations and extension programs were disseminating agricultural technologies—about two to six years after the technologies were first introduced. The same households were reinterviewed in 2006 – 2007. Using nearest-neighbor matching to construct a statistical comparison group, we find that long-term impacts differ across agricultural technology interventions and across outcomes. Long-term impacts on household-level consumption expenditures and asset accumulation are, in general, insignificant in the improved vegetables sites, but are positive and significant in the individually operated fishponds sites. Interestingly, impacts on individual nutrient intake, nutrient adequacy, and nutritional status do not necessarily follow the pattern of household-level impacts. The improved vegetable program, despite insignificant or even negative impacts at the household level, seems to have resulted in increases in vitamin A consumption (and iron consumption for men), an increase in average weight-for-age Z-scores among children, and a reduction in the proportion of girls stunted and the proportion of boys underweight. Women in the improved vegetable program also experienced increases in body mass index. Impacts in the group-operated fishponds sites on nutrient intake are mostly negative, although we do find improvements in weight-for-age Z-scores and a decline in stunting and wasting among boys. Although one would expect significant improvements in nutritional status in the individually operated fishponds sites, impacts on nutritional status are mixed. Nutrient availability and the fraction of <b>members</b> <b>consuming</b> the recommended daily allowances have improved significantly for most nutrients considered, among men and women. Although indicators of long-term nutritional status worsen, short-term nutritional status indicators improve. The fraction of women with low hemoglobin levels also decreases significantly. We argue that the differences in long-term and short-term impacts arise from several causes: differences in dissemination and targeting mechanisms that may affect what types of households adopt and benefit from the technologies; initial existing differences between control and treatment groups (controlled for using matching methods); {{the degree to which a}} technology is divisible and easily disseminated outside the treatment group; and finally, intrahousehold allocation processes that determine how gains from the new technology are allocated among household members. agricultural technology adoption, long-term impacts, Nutrition,...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} records {{that have been}} made for children and the role they play in the construction of particular discourses of childhood. Firstly, I attempt to define the category of children’s music through reference to texts, audiences and the wider industry. I examine how such definitions have changed over time. Secondly, I assess the role of the adults in the production of children’s records and attempt to answer questions about the dissemination of ideology. How do children’s records indicate how adults perceive children, what they want them to know, to understand, how they want them to behave, and what they want them to become? What are the dominant ideologies being communicated? What role does nostalgia play in the choices adults make in creating records for children? The investigation aims to redress the neglect of the academy by examining a range of case studies to reveal how specific children’s records reflect and construct specific childhoods in different social, historical and geographical contexts. As such, I provide analyses of a variety of discourses of childhood, and theoretical concepts before examining societal attitudes to children in contingent synchronic settings. I employ a structuralist approach to reveal the stability and endurance of specific ideologies of childhood, and to investigate the competing and often contradictory ways in which these have manifested themselves in specific examples of children’s music. The study ‘listens in’ on childhood and examines the conversations that adults have conducted with children through musical artefacts over the years. Through the use of a Children’s Music Quotient, I analyse the degree of ‘childness’ (Hollidale, 1997) of individual texts. Ideas of implied readership, agency and competence are employed {{to assess the impact of}} a range of texts on audiences with a range of childness. The study reveals how changes in children’s music map changes in discourses of childhood through the decades. Specifically, folk music of the 1940 s and 1950 s served to foster the child as a member of a community, and a citizen with wider social responsibilities. The intergenerational appeal of the music of BBC’s Children’s Choice in the 1950 s and 1960 s frames children as family <b>members</b> <b>consuming</b> partially-age-differentiated musical products at home. Records of the 1970 s and 1980 s from TV shows such as Sesame Street and Bagpuss serve to partially individuate the child as a viewer through the production of age-differentiated products. Children’s records of the 1990 s from The Wiggles, Hannah Montana and tween produce increasingly-individuated consumers of transmedial products. By the early 2000 s, Kidz Bop and Pop Jr. related to the child as a consumer with rights and an identity driven by consumption. A study of music from the 2010 s reveals the child as a consumer-producer framed in an intergenerational infantilised society...|$|R
