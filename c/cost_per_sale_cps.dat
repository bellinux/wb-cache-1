In this research, the competition is proxied by PPE (Property, Plant, and Equipment), CPS (<b>Cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>Sale),</b> and Company’s Sales while agency cost is proxied by audit fee. This research is based on previous research conducted by Nayeri and Salehi (2013) and Valipour et. al. (2013). The sample of this research was manufacturing company which listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange (BEI) in the year 2010 to 2012.

The result of this study showed with ABC concepts can allocate the total distribution costs that consumed by each operations activities. This study also showed that that the ratio of total distribution <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> <b>sales</b> volume average <b>per</b> month (14. 9 percent) is still higher than the standard (below 10 percent).

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a simple {{empirical}} method to test two alternative {{versions of the}} Melitz (2003) model, one with global fixed export costs and one with bilateral fixed export costs. With global <b>costs,</b> import <b>sales</b> <b>per</b> product variety (relative to domestic <b>sales</b> <b>per</b> variety) are decreasing in variable trade barriers, {{as a result of}} adjustment occurring along the intensive margin of trade. With bilateral <b>costs,</b> imports <b>per</b> product variety are increasing in fixed trade costs, due to adjustment occurring along the extensive margin. We apply our approach to data on imports of U. S. motion pictures in 46 countries over 1995 - 2006. Imports per product variety are decreasing in geographic distance, linguistic distance, and other measures of trade costs, consistent with adjustment to these costs occurring along the intensive margin. There is relatively little variation in the number of U. S. movies that countries import but wide variation in the box-office revenues per movie. The data thus appear to reject the bilateral-fixed-export-cost model in favor of the global-fixed-export-cost model. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{relationship}} between performance and use of brand terms in the key phrases that link advertisements to searcher queries. We use data that consist of more than 2. 5 million daily records from a key word advertising campaign of a major U. S. retailer. The campaign spanned nearly four years, involved approximately $ 8 million in advertising cost, and generated more than $ 23 million in sales. We categorize key phrases and advertisements as either brand focused or non–brand focused. Using analysis of variance in a 2 × 2 design, we analyze use of branded terms on the critical key word advertising metrics of number of clicks, <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> click, <b>sales</b> revenue generated, number of orders, number of items ordered, and return on advertising cost, as well as number of impressions triggered by these key phrases. Therefore, we investigate a signifi‑ cant spectrum of user actions and consumer behaviors in a sponsored search campaign. Our findings {{show that there is}} a significant advantage to matching branding terms in key phrases and advertisements relative to any other combination of key phrase or advertise‑ ment for all the metrics examined. A combination of a branded phrase and a branded advertisement generated 15 times more sales revenue than any other combination of phrase and advertisement. Therefore, a focus by key word advertisers on branded terms for search engine ads could be quite beneficial for both the effectiveness and efficiency of key word advertising. The implication for online advertising and key word search in the e‑commerce domain, especially for large retailers, is that brand mentions in both key phrase and advertisements correlate with higher conversions...|$|R

Cost-utility analysis: gross cost and net <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> quality-adjusted life year gained calculated using two alternative models. RESULTS: <b>Cost</b> <b>per</b> life saved or death prevented was HK$ 4, 442, 350 (non-discounted); <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> fatal or non-fatal cardiac event prevented HK$ 1, 146, 413; <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> procedure prevented HK$ 732, 759; and <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> fatal or non-fatal stroke prevented HK$ 2, 961, 566.
