50|$|One analog TV channel {{occupies}} a 6-MHz-wide frequency band in NTSC-based systems, or an 8-MHz-wide frequency band in PAL or SECAM-based systems. Each channel is centred {{on a specific}} frequency carrier {{so that there is}} no interference with adjacent or harmonic channels. To be able to view a digitally modulated channel, home, or customer-premises equipment (CPE), e.g. digital televisions, computers, or set-top boxes, are required to convert the RF signals to signals that are compatible with display devices such as analog televisions or computer monitors. The US Federal Communication Commission (FCC) has ruled that consumers can obtain a <b>cable</b> <b>card</b> from their local MSO to authorize viewing digital channels.|$|E
5000|$|Since the {{discontinued}} Hughes Electronics DirectTV DVR with TiVo model HR10-250, all newer TiVo {{units have}} been fully HDTV capable.

Unlike the HR10-250, neither the Series3 nor Series4 units can record from the DirecTV service; conversely, the HR10-250 cannot record from digital cable. Other TiVo models may be connected to a high definition television (HDTV), but are not capable of recording HDTV signals, although they may be connected to a cable HDTV set-top box and record the down-converted outputs.|$|E

5000|$|D-VHS's primary {{advantage}} {{is that it is}} still the best way to archive encrypted high definition material from cable programming. Cable, satellite companies, TiVo, and PCs equipped with <b>cable</b> <b>card</b> tuners all offer high-definition digital video recorders, but archival has proven to be an obstacle, as proprietary boxes have restrictions on moving encrypted content. Outside of D-VHS, only HD capture devices that use an analog conversion process, such as the Hauppauge HD PVR and Elgato EyeTV HD, have enabled removal of encrypted content off many of the above proprietary boxes. These HD DVR's use an analog conversion process, producing slightly degraded but still high definition grade recordings. D-VHS, on the other hand, does not need {{to take advantage of this}} so-called [...] "analog hole", since D-VHS makes a pure bit-for-bit recording with no conversion necessary. This is made possible by compliance with CCI flag values carried by the digital streams, wherein only D-VHS is allowed to digitally move recordings of content originally flagged as Copy Once off of a DVR device and onto a D-VHS tape. This programming that complies with the CCI flags then marks such material on the tape such that no second generation copies can be made from the tape itself, though additional copies can still be made directly from the original DVR unit to additional tapes.|$|E

50|$|In practice, {{the concept}} was marred by {{proliferation}} of incompatible physical layer and network protocol implementations, and a plethora of methods of sharing resources.

40|$|Courses in {{computer}} networks require dedicated laboratories that {{are equipped with}} all the basic networking components: servers, workstations, cables, switches, routers, bridges, etc. An important element of a laboratory’s infrastructure is a variety of network configurations for specific experiments. A possible method of disseminating network configurations is a dedicated server. The server stores appropriate disk images, which can then be downloaded to student computers. An interesting and cost-effective alternative {{is the concept of}} virtual machines. Students do not waste time on reinstalling operating systems or rebooting computers and gain fast access to a selection of network configurations from local computers. In addition, complex experiments, such as analysing network protocols and services, securing confidential information transmitted over the Internet and testing redundant disk systems, can be implemented on a single computer without the need for the usual hardware components, such as <b>cables,</b> network <b>cards,</b> switches or multiple disk drives. Virtual machines are an ideal solution in distance education, as well as for universities and colleges with limited financial recourses...|$|R

5000|$|As an overlay system, InSync’s {{hardware}} components {{plug into}} existing traffic cabinet hardware. The system is Ethernet- and web-based, compatible with all modern controllers, cabinets and detection devices {{and does not}} require removal or upgrades of any hardware or software.

If existing detection methods are preferred (InSync:Tesla), Rhythm Engineering will integrate the installed inputs with the adaptive system. Once cables are pulled from the camera locations to the traffic cabinet, installation of the cameras and in-cabinet hardware typically requires about four hours per intersection.

40|$|Abstract—The most {{straightforward}} way {{to reduce}} net-work power consumption is to turn off idle links and nodes (switches/routers), which we call the power down approach. In a wired network, especially in a backbone network, many links are actually “bundles ” of multiple physical <b>cables</b> and line <b>cards</b> that can be shut down independently. In this paper, we study the following routing problem for green networking in wired networks: Given a set of end-to-end communication sessions, determine how to route data traffic through the network such that total power consumption is minimized by turning off unused cables in bundled links and nodes, subject to the constraint that the traffic demand of each session is satisfied. We present an integer linear programming to provide optimal solutions. We also present two fast and effective heuristic algorithms {{to solve the problem}} in polynomial time. It has been shown by simulation results based on the Abilene network and the NSF network that the proposed heuristic algorithms consistently provide close-to-optimal solutions.

5000|$|CableCARDs {{may be used}} {{to access}} both {{standard}} definition and high definition channels {{as long as they are}} not part of a switched video system. (This applies to one-way devices only; two-way devices are capable of receiving and viewing switched video. The ability for one-way devices to receive and view switched video has changed with the addition of the Tuning Resolver Interface Specification. Tuning adaptors and tuning adaptor interfaces have been added to provide communication back to the headend needed for switched video.) CableCARDs are not necessary for viewing unscrambled digital cable channels if the user has a QAM tuner—a feature in some televisions and DVRs. CableCARD support is most common on higher end televisions that include a special slot for the CableCARD and a built-in <b>cable</b> tuner. The <b>card</b> acts like a unique [...] "key" [...] to unlock the channels and services to which the cable customer has subscribed, and the television's remote-control will also control the cable channels. Televisions that support CableCARD should be labeled by the manufacturer as [...] "digital cable ready" [...] (DCR).|$|R
40|$|In {{backbone}} networks, {{the line}} cards that drive {{the links between}} neighboring routers consume {{a large amount of}} energy. Since these networks are typically overprovisioned, selectively shutting down links during periods of low demand seems like a good way to reduce energy consumption. However, removing entire links from the topology often reduces capacity and connectivity too much, and leads to transient disruptions in the routing protocol. In this paper, we exploit the fact that many links in core networks are actually “bundles ” of multiple physical <b>cables</b> and line <b>cards</b> that can be shut down independently. Since identifying the optimal set of cables to shut down is an NP-complete problem, we propose several heuristics based on linear optimization techniques. We evaluate our heuristics on topology and traffic data from the Abilene backbone as well as on two synthetic topologies. The energy savings are significant, our simplest heuristic reduces energy consumption by 79 % on Abilene under realistic traffic loads and bundled links consisting of five cables. Our optimization techniques run efficiently using standard optimization tools, such as the AMPL/CPLEX solver, making them a practical approach for network operators to reduce the energy consumption of their backbones. 1...|$|R
50|$|When Ethernet became Fast Ethernet, it {{continued}} to use the Carrier Sense Multiple Access With Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) mechanism to manage traffic on the network cable. 100VG {{took advantage of the}} token passing concept that made ARCNET and Token Ring popular in order to provide consistent performance no matter how large the network became. It removed the token passing responsibility from the wiring and network nodes and placed it internal to the 100VG-AnyLAN hubs. These hubs contained the rotating token that never left the hub itself. When a node wanted to transmit data, it would raise a bit on its hub port connection that indicating to the hub that it was ready. As the token passed by a ready hub port, it would then open up traffic to that node. Because the token stayed within the hub, it did not have to traverse long cables going to every node as in ARCNET and Token Ring therefore becoming faster than those other deterministic networking standards and being less susceptible to <b>cabling</b> problems, network <b>card</b> failures, and line interference. Real-life load testing showed 100VG-AnyLAN reaching 95% of its theoretical network speed instead of about 45% as in Fast Ethernet when using hubs. Fast Ethernet switches were not commonplace at first because of high cost and limited availability so, initially, 100VG had a significant performance advantage.|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decade digital signal {{processors}} (DSPs) have hit critical mass for high-volume applications (Figure 1). Today, the entire digital wireless industry operates with DSP-enabled handsets and base stations. The mass-storage industry depends on DSPs to produce hard-disk drives and digital versatile disc players. Ever-increasing numbers of digital subscriber line and <b>cable</b> modems, line <b>cards,</b> and other wired telecommunications equipments are based on DSPs. Digital still cameras, hearing aids, motor control, consumer audio gear such as Internet audio {{are just some of}} the many mass market applications in which DSPs are routinely found today. More specialized DSP applications include image processing, medical instrumentation, navigation, and guidance. With the growing importance of DSPs and their applications, it seems appropriate to look at the changes occurring in these devices and to hazard a few guesses about where DSP innovations will lead in the opening decades of the new century. The continued growth of DSPenabled applications will depend on developments in several areas of technology: the underlying manufacturing processes, the DSP core and chip architectures, and the software for development and applications. An additional factor, and the most difficult one to anticipate, is innovation. In a few years, designers will be dealing with DSPs that integrate hundreds of millions of on-chip transistors and deliver performance measured in trillions of instructions per second.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an experimental investigation of flame propagation in a 3. 6 -meter Flame Acceleration Tube (FAT) {{by the use}} of optical probes for flame detection and dust concentration measurements. The experiments in the FAT took place in the workshop of GexCon AS at Fantoft, Bergen. Fellow Master Student Gisle A. Enstad, {{who took part in the}} shared experiments, describes the impedance flame detection method in his thesis. Flame detection and dust concentration probes were made. Preliminary tests were performed at the University of Bergen in the 20 -litre explosion vessel of the USBM type. The final design of the probes implements both the optical and impedance based measurement method. In the preliminary phase of this work, the FAT was equipped with instrumentation cables and power supplies for measurement probes and electrically operated valves. A complete logging system with <b>cables,</b> a logging <b>card</b> from National Instruments and software for running the experiments was also set up as a part of this project. Closed vessel experiments were performed with both maize starch and propane/air mixtures in the FAT. As the FAT was fitted with six circular windows at one side, the experiments could be recorder with a high-speed camera. A general trend in the results from the experiments was that the optical method detected the flame earlier than the impedance method. Video observations tended to measure the flame arrival time earlier than the optical method on gas and later on dust, while the impedance method were later than the other two. A thermocouple was also used as a reference to the other methods and it showed good correlation with the optical/impedance probe, as it measured the flame arrival time between the times measured by the two other principles...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} {{of a series of}} internationally published, peer reviewed, journal and conference research papers that analyse the educational and training needs of undergraduate Information Technology (IT) students within the area of Computer and Network Technology (CNT) Education. Research by Maj et al has found that accredited computing science curricula can fail to meet the expectations of employers in the field of CNT: “It was found that none of these students could perform first line maintenance on a Personal Computer (PC) to a professional standard with due regard to safety, both to themselves and the equipment. Neither could they install communication <b>cards,</b> <b>cables</b> and network operating system or manage a population of networked PCs to an acceptable commercial standard without further extensive training. It is noteworthy that none of the students interviewed had ever opened a PC. It is significant that all those interviewed for this study had successfully completed all the units on computer architecture and communication engineering 2 ̆ 2 (Maj, Robbins, Shaw, 2 ̆ 6 Duley, 1998). The students 2 ̆ 7 curricula at that time lacked units in which they gained hands-on experience in modern PC hardware or networking skills. This was despite the fact that their computing science course was level one accredited, the highest accreditation level offered by the Australian Computer Society (ACS). The results of the initial survey in Western Australia led to the introduction of two new units within the Computing Science Degree at Edith Cowan University (ECU), Computer Installation 2 ̆ 6 Maintenance (CIM) and Network Installation 2 ̆ 6 Maintenance (NIM) (Maj, Fetherston, Charlesworth, 2 ̆ 6 Robbins, 1998). Uniquely within an Australian university context these new syllabi require students to work on real equipment. Such experience excludes digital circuit investigation, which is still a recommended approach by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) for computer architecture units (ACM, 2001, p. 97). Instead, the CIM unit employs a top-down approach based initially upon students 2 ̆ 7 everyday experiences, which is more in accordance with constructivist educational theory and practice. These papers propose an alternate model of IT education that helps to accommodate the educational and vocational needs of IT students in the context of continual rapid changes and developments in technology. The ACM have recognised the need for variation noting that: 2 ̆ 2 There are many effective ways to organize a curriculum even for a particular set of goals and objectives 2 ̆ 2 (Tucker et al., 1991, p. 70). A possible major contribution to new knowledge of these papers relates to how high level abstract bandwidth (B-Node) models may contribute to the understanding of why and how computer and networking technology systems have developed over time. Because these models are de-coupled from the underlying technology, which is subject to rapid change, these models may help to future-proof student knowledge and understanding of the ongoing and future development of computer and networking systems. The de-coupling is achieved through abstraction based upon bandwidth or throughput rather than the specific implementation of the underlying technologies. One of the underlying problems is that computing systems tend to change faster than the ability of most educational institutions to respond. Abstraction and the use of B-Node models could help educational models to more quickly respond to changes in the field, and can also help to introduce an element of future-proofing in the education of IT students. The importance of abstraction has been noted by the ACM who state that: 2 ̆ 2 Levels of Abstraction: the nature and use of abstraction in computing; the use of abstraction in managing complexity, structuring systems, hiding details, and capturing recurring patterns; the ability to represent an entity or system by abstractions having different levels of detail and specificity 2 ̆ 2 (ACM, 1991 b). Bloom et al note the importance of abstraction, listing under a heading of: “Knowledge of the universals and abstractions in a field” the objective: 2 ̆ 2 Knowledge of the major schemes and patterns by which phenomena and ideas arc organized. These are large structures, theories, and generalizations which dominate a subject or field or problems. These are the highest levels of abstraction and complexity 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 (Bloom, Engelhart, Furst, Hill, 2 ̆ 6 Krathwohl, 1956, p. 203). Abstractions can be applied to computer and networking technology to help provide students with common fundamental concepts regardless of the particular underlying technological implementation to help avoid the rapid redundancy of a detailed knowledge of modem computer and networking technology implementation and hands-on skills acquisition. Again the ACM note that: “Enduring computing concepts include ideas that transcend any specific vendor, package or skill set [...] . While skills are fleeting, fundamental concepts are enduring and provide long lasting benefits to students, critically important in a rapidly changing discipline 2 ̆ 2 (ACM, 2001, p. 70) These abstractions can also be reinforced by experiential learning to commercial practices. In this context, the other possibly major contribution of new knowledge provided by this thesis is an efficient, scalable and flexible model for assessing hands-on skills and understanding of IT students. This is a form of Competency-Based Assessment (CBA), which has been successfully tested as part of this research and subsequently implemented at ECU. This is the first time within this field that this specific type of research has been undertaken within the university sector within Australia. Hands-on experience and understanding can become outdated hence the need for future proofing provided via B-Nodes models. The three major research questions of this study are: •Is it possible to develop a new, high level abstraction model for use in CNT education? •Is it possible to have CNT curricula that are more directly relevant to both student and employer expectations without suffering from rapid obsolescence? •Can WI effective, efficient and meaningful assessment be undertaken to test students 2 ̆ 7 hands-on skills and understandings? The ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication (SJGCOMM) workshop report on Computer Networking, Curriculum Designs and Educational Challenges, note a list of teaching approaches: 2 ̆ 2 [...] . the more 2 ̆ 7 hands-on 2 ̆ 7 laboratory approach versus the more traditional in-class lecture-based approach; the bottom-up approach towards subject matter verus the top-down approach 2 ̆ 2 (Kurose, Leibeherr, Ostermann, 2 ̆ 6 Ott-Boisseau, 2002, para 1). Bandwidth considerations are approached from the PC hardware level and at each of the seven layers of the International Standards Organisation (ISO) Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model. It is believed that this research is of significance to computing education. However, further research is needed...|$|R
