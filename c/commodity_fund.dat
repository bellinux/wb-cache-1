40|$|For over 65 years, the U. S. Department of Agriculture has {{purchased}} commodity foods for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) {{in an effort}} to support both schools and food producers. Based on data from 339 Minnesota school districts from 2001 – 2008, this research examined whether the NSLP's in-kind food program is an efficient and equitable way to fund school food services. Multivariate models suggested that the program is inefficient, though offered limited insight into district-level factors that affected utilization of <b>commodity</b> <b>funding,</b> and therefore offered less clear conclusions about equity. It was estimated that districts obtained just $ 0. 60 in commodity food value given a $ 1 increase in available <b>commodity</b> <b>funding</b> over the years observed, and that the commodity program's system of “reconciled” and “rollover” funding accounted for much of this discrepancy. Based on these results, it is recommended that a cash benefit replace the NSLP's current in-kind food benefit for schools...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{commodity}} trading advisors' (CTAs) investment performance may be partially explained by their incentive compensation contracts. Contracts include base, incentive and asset parameters. The relationships between contract parameters and performance are theoretically indeterminate but are examined here empirically. Results indicate that incentive parameters are {{positively related to}} return means and standard deviations. The dollar amounts of assets CTAs manage are negatively related to return means and standard deviations, supporting Elton et al. 's (1987, 1989) finding that CTA performance falls after public offerings of commodity funds. Intuitively, since dollar fees are a function of assets, at the higher asset and fee levels achieved through <b>commodity</b> <b>fund</b> offerings, CTAs may safeguard assets and fees by pursuing less risky investment strategies. incentive compensation contracts, commodity trading advisors, agency theory, <b>commodity</b> <b>fund</b> performance, options...|$|E
