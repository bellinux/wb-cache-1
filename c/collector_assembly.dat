40|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} systems are {{expected}} to be sited in desert locations where the direct normal irradiation is above 1800 kWh/m 2. year. These systems include large solar <b>collector</b> <b>assemblies,</b> which account for a significant share of the investment cost. Solarreflectors are the main components of these solar <b>collector</b> <b>assemblies</b> and dust/sand storms may affect their reflectance properties, either by soiling or by surface abrasion. While soiling can be reverted by cleaning, surface abrasion is a non reversible degradation. The aim of this project was to study the accelerated aging of second surface silvered thickglass solar reflectors under simulated sandstorm conditions and develop a multi-parametric model which relates the specular reflectance loss to dust/sand storm parameters: wind velocity, dust concentration and time of exposure. This project focused on the degradation caused by surface abrasion. Sandstorm conditions were simulated in a prototype environmental test chamber. Material samples (6 cm x 6 cm) were exposed to Arizona coarse test dust. The dust stream impactedthese material samples at a perpendicular angle. Both wind velocity and dust concentrationwere maintained at a stable level for each accelerated aging test. The total exposure time in the test chamber was limited to 1 hour. Each accelerated aging test was interrupted every 4 minutes to measure the specular reflectance of the material sample after cleaning. The accelerated aging test campaign had to be aborted prematurely due to a contamination of the dust concentration sensor. A robust multi-parametric degradation model could thus not be derived. The experimental data showed that the specular reflectance loss decreasedeither linearly or exponentially with exposure time, so that a degradation rate could be defined as a single modeling parameter. A correlation should be derived to relate this degradation rate to control parameters such as wind velocity and dust/sand concentration. The sandstorm chamber design would have to be updated before performing further accelerated aging test campaigns. The design upgrade should improve both the reliability of the test equipment and the repeatability of accelerated aging tests. An outdoor exposure test campaign should be launched in deserts {{to learn more about the}} intensity, frequencyand duration of dust/sand storms. This campaign would also serve to correlate the results of outdoor exposure tests with accelerated exposure tests in order to develop a robust service lifetime prediction model for different types of solar reflector materials...|$|R

The demonstration project was undertaken as a step to reduce green house gas emissions, explore the viability of concentrating solar thermal technology under local conditions, and introduce concentrated solar power electricity generation in Alberta, which enjoys the highest solar resource of direct normal irradiance (DNI) in the country. The 203 MWe municipal power plant consists of four combustion turbine (CT) /heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) units feeding superheated steam to two steam turbines.

40|$|Sandia National Laboratories has {{completed}} thermal performance testing on the Schott parabolic trough receiver using the LS- 2 collector on the Sandia rotating platform at the National Solar Thermal Test Facility in Albuquerque, NM. This testing was funded {{as part of}} the US DOE Sun-Lab USA-Trough program. The receiver tested was a new Schott receiver, known as Heat Collector Elements (HCEs). Schott is a new manufacturer of trough HCEs. The Schott HCEs are 4 m long; therefore, two were joined and mounted on the LS- 2 collector module for the test. The Schott HCE design consists of a 70 mm diameter high solar absorptance coated stainless steel (SS) tube encapsulated within a 125 mm diameter Pyrex{reg_sign} glass tube with vacuum in the annulus formed between the SS and glass tube to minimize convection heat losses. The Schott HCE design is unique in two regards. First, the bellows used to compensate for the difference in thermal expansion between the metal and glass tube are inside the glass envelope rather than outside. Second, the composition of materials at the glass-to-metal seal has very similar thermal expansion coefficients making the joint less prone to breakage from thermal shock. Sandia National Laboratories provided both the azimuth and elevation collector module tracking systems used during the tests. The test results showed the efficiency of the Schott HCE to be very similar to current HCEs being manufactured by Solel.

40|$|A simple, {{low-cost}} solar {{water heater}} has been developed for operation in Mediterranean Europe or regions of similar latitude (40 - 45 Â° north). It {{takes the form of}} a trapezoidal-shaped water store in direct contact with an inclined flat-plate solar <b>collector</b> <b>assembly.</b> This cross-section induces thermal stratification in the water store, and provides sufficient energy storage to meet typical daily hot-water demand. Its thermal performance is critically dependent on the waterside convective heat-transfer coefficient on the backward-reclining collector plate; previously evaluated by Cruz et al. (Cruz JMS, Hammond GP, Reis AJPS. Buoyancy-driven convective heat exchange in a trapezoidal-shaped solar collector/thermal store. In: Proc. of the 5 th ASME/JSME Joint Thermal Engineering Conf., San Diego, CA (ASME, New York), 1999, 9 pp). In the current design, the absorber plate inclination to the horizontal was fixed at 45 Â° (close to the local latitude) in order to yield maximum solar gain over a typical year. The energy saving provided by the solar collector/thermal store demonstrator largely depends on the amount of thermal stratification within the trapezoidal storage cavity. This was evaluated via both computation and measurements of the temperature field. A thermal network analysis model was then used to assess the energy-saving potential of the composite system. It indicated that a 30 - 70 % reduction in daily load could be obtained in contrast to direct, electrical or gas, heating: the smaller saving occurred at times of greatest use or hot-water take-off.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to outline {{the development of a}} novel rotationally moulded solar water heater. It will describe the underlying principles that make the system unique and conclude with the industrial development of a commercial version of the heater. The solar water heater is of the integral collector-storage type. The most unique feature of the water heater is that the collector glazing system also forms a transparent upper surface of the storage tank. The highly efficient top cover system provides the maximum possible use of available solar radiation, although some penalty is imposed through relatively large night time heat losses. The top cover system is a prime consideration in this thesis and the principles of solar transmission and thermal insulation are discussed in detail. Mains pressure hot water supply is achieved by passing the mains pressure cold water through a finned heat exchange tube that is submerged in the water storage chamber. The water exits the tube at a temperature close to that of the stored heat transfer medium in the collector/storage chamber. Careful consideration was given to design of the heat exchange circuit to optimise extraction of energy from the solar water heater. The collector is composed of three main components that have been developed to suit manufacturing from plastic using the rotational moulding process. The absorber/storage component houses the heat exchange tube, inner glazing and 150 litres of water which is heated by solar radiation. The top cover houses the upper transparent insulation, the outer glazing and provides additional side insulation. A mounting tray that facilitates permanent attachment of the <b>collector</b> <b>assembly</b> to the roof of a dwelling or suitable intermediate framework is the final component.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} design {{optimization}} of parabolic-trough solar power generation systems. In these systems, solar radiation is focused onto receiver tubes {{in which a}} thermal carrier fluid is circulated. The collected thermal energy is then used to generate steam that powers a steam turbine to drive an electric generator. An optimization model is constructed that aims to minimize the cost of electric energy produced. In this model, the optimization is concerned with decision variables that affect: i) the solar field and ii) thermal storage. The steam turbine and generator {{are not part of}} the optimization model, as they are assumed to use the same off-shelf components that are used in fossil-fuel based power plants. It is understood that decisions concerning the solar field both affect and are affected by the design of the solar <b>collector</b> <b>assemblies</b> (SCAs), which are the support structures that hold the focusing mirrors. Design of the SCAs is a structural optimization problem that aims to minimize the cost of the structure while satisfying dimensional and loading constraints. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used for the optimization of the parabolic trough system model. For every candidate design examined by GA for the solar field and thermal storage, the most suitable structural design of the SCAs is obtained from solving the sub-problem of structural optimization. This nested" optimization model is made possible by pre-analyzing a large range of SCA designs and recording them as a lookup database.

40|$|Due to {{continuously}} increasing energy demands, {{particularly with}} the emergence of electric vehicles (EV), smart energy grids, and portable electronics, advanced energy conversion and storage systems such as fuel-cells and metal-air batteries have drawn tremendous research and industrial attention. Even though the lithium-ion battery technology is the most developed and widely distributed energy device {{for a wide range of}} applications, some researchers view its energy density insufficient for fulfilling the ultimate requirements of highly energy intensive applications such as EVs. Recently, zinc-air batteries have re-gained research attention since the initial development in the 1970 s due to their remarkably highly energy density and the potential to be electrically rechargeable. However, some technological hurdles such as low charge/discharge energy efficiency, and insufficient cycle stability have hampered commercialization and introduction of rechargeable zinc-air batteries to the market. The mentioned hurdles are currently the main challenges of rechargeable zinc-air battery developed, and they stem from the fact that the reaction kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are intrinsically very sluggish. The two are the main electrochemical reactions that govern the charge and discharge processes of a rechargeable metal-air battery at the air electrode, and these oxygen reactions must be facilitated by active electrocatalysts in order to progress them at practically viable and stable rates. Currently, the best known catalysts for ORR and OER are carbon supported platinum (Pt/C) and iridium (Ir/C), respectively. However, the use of these precious metal based catalysts for large scale applications like EVs and energy storage systems is prohibitively expensive. Additionally, the durability of these catalysts have been reported to be insufficient for long-term usage under normal device operating conditions. Perhaps most importantly, the precious metal based catalysts are strongly active towards only one of the two oxygen reactions required for rechargeable applications. For example, Pt/C is a strong ORR active catalyst, while Ir/C is a strong OER active catalyst. Recently in the literature, a simple physical mixture of these two catalysts have been used to render bi-functionality, but this method is very rudimentary and still requires two separate syntheses for each catalyst. This suggests that future bi-functionally active catalysts must not only be non-precious (inexpensive), but also a single active material capable of catalyzing both ORR and OER over the same active surface. Having said above, non-precious catalyst research, specifically for bi-functional ORR and OER electrocatalyses, has increased dramatically beginning in the 90 ’s with a very popular and positive belief in the energy community that rechargeable lithium-air batteries could potentially replace lithium-ion batteries. This wave of interest has also picked up research in rechargeable zinc-air batteries since the electrochemical oxygen reactions that take place at the air electrodes are fundamentally very similar. Additionally, the use of zinc metal as the anode, which is one of Earth’s most abundant elements, and the water-based (aqueous) solutions as the electrolyte (as opposed to organic ones) made the rechargeable zinc-air battery development very attractive and seemingly easy to scale-up. Moreover, primary (non-rechargeable) zinc-air batteries have already been commercialized and are available in the market as hearing aid batteries, leading many researchers to believe that a simple tuning of the current technology would lead to a successful secondary (rechargeable) zinc-air battery development. However, there are a set of technical difficulties specific to rechargeable zinc-air batteries that have slowed the development for the past few decades. Therefore, the work presented in this thesis aims to address the challenges of rechargeable zinc-air batteries particularly from the active bi-functional electrocatalyst standpoint to make them as commercially viable as possible. In the first study, a facile hydrothermal materials synthesis technique has been employed to synthesize a non-precious metal cobalt oxide bi-functional catalyst. Microscopic characterizations have revealed the morphology of this material to be mesoporous hexagonal nanodisks, a high surface area catalyst compared to simple granular nanoparticles which enhances active site exposure and transport of reactants during the electrochemical reactions. This unique nanostructure has been made possible with the addition of surface-active agents that played a role of capping agent, binding to specific crystal faces and allowing growth of cobalt oxide only in certain directions. Additionally, the adsorbed capping agent has been found to leave mesopores on the nanodisks as it decomposes during the heat treatment following the hydrothermal process. Compared to randomly shaped nanoparticle catalyst of the same atomic composition, the mesoporous nanodisks greatly outperformed in terms of both charge and discharge performance of a rechargeable zinc-air battery. In the second study, the bi-functional capabilities of the cobalt oxide catalyst towards the ORR and OER in the first study have been improved by introducing nickel metal substituents into the spinel crystal lattice, as well as adapting a highly conductive nano-structured carbon support. The bi-functional activity enhancements have been attributed to an increase in electrical conductivity of spinel cobalt oxide with the insertion of nickel atoms into specific interstitial sites of the spinel lattice, as well as the high surface area nano-carbon support which helped to disperse the active spinel oxide catalyst and facilitate charge transfer during the electrochemical reactions. In the third study, the effect of nickel and manganese insertion into the spinel cobalt oxide lattice on the bi-functional catalytic activity has been studied more in detail. Spinel oxide catalysts with different atomic compositions, including cobalt oxide (un-doped), nickel cobalt oxide, and manganese cobalt oxide, have been synthesized as nanocrystals that self-assembled into high surface area porous spheres. Based on the electrochemical evaluation, the best overall bi-functional catalytic activity has been observed with nickel-substituted cobalt oxide, while the least has been observed with manganese cobalt oxide, with pristine cobalt oxide in the middle. Interestingly, computational modelling of these catalysts has resulted in the same activity trend, confirming the importance of choosing an appropriate metal substituent depending on the level of bi-functional activity required. In the last study, the knowledge gained from the high surface area nanostructured spinel oxide catalysts has been transferred to the fabrication of active catalyst/current <b>collector</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Specifically, cobalt oxide nanowire array has been directly grown on stainless steel mesh, a typical current collector used for zinc-air batteries. This unique active electrode assembly design greatly simplified battery architecture and the preparation steps required to produce a rechargeable air electrode, which usually involve physical deposition techniques such as spray-coating to deposit as-synthesized catalysts on gas diffusion layers. During this step, catalyst is mixed with ancillary materials such as carbon black and polymer ionomer, which corrode during battery charging. The direct coupling of active cobalt oxide catalyst onto the current collector completely eliminated the use of any additional material, and a gas diffusion layer was simply attached to the active assembly to form a rechargeable air electrode. Without any corrosion, the advanced electrode has demonstrated a remarkable durability during rechargeable zinc-air battery testing, lasting over 600 hours of operation, which has never been reported in the literature. There are still a plenty of opportunities to further leverage the knowledge and experience gained from this thesis work to improve the performance of electrically rechargeable zinc-air batteries. For example, the cobalt oxide nanowire arrays can be doped with other metals such as nickel and manganese to precisely tune the bi-functional catalytic activity depending on specific requirements for the battery application. Also, the idea of high surface area nano-carbon support can be used to fabricate an interfacial layer between the cobalt oxide array and stainless steel mesh to improve charge transfer during the reactions. Graphitized carbon, such as graphene nanosheets and carbon nanotubes, that are stable in rechargeable zinc-air battery conditions are great candidates for this purpose and is likely to significantly improve both the activities of ORR and OER...|$|R
