Increased BMI {{is one of the}} main reasons why the contraceptive users stopped their contraceptive. However, increased BMI was not experienced by all users, there are other factors that can influence increased BMI, such as consumption, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of lifestyle to anthropometic change in the injectable hormonal contraceptive users. This study used observational analytic study and case control design. The sample size use simple random sampling technique. To determine the effect and odd ratio, this study used a simple logistic regression test. The results showed that lifestyle factor that affect and risk for anthropometric changein the three-month contraceptive users is sedentary behavior. Sedentary behavior ≥ 3 hours per day can increase the risk of increased BMI 9, 048 times compared with sedentary behavior < 3 hours per day. The conclusion is sedentary lifestyle affected increased BMI among three- month injectable hormonal contraceptive users. By reducing sedentary behavior habit and increasing exercise behaviour, three-month injectable contraceptive users can prevent the risk of increased BMI.

Intrauterine contraceptive devices which are among the safest and most effective reversible contraceptives available, are particularly suitable for women in developing countries as they are affordable, convenient to use, do not require re-supply visits and are very cost-effective. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the socio-demographic characteristics of intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> device <b>acceptors,</b> the pattern of insertions and complications at the University of Uyo Teaching hospital, Uyo. Method: The record cards of all clients who had intrauterine contraceptive device inserted at the family planning clinic over a six-year period were reviewed. Results: During the study period, there were 852 new <b>contraceptive</b> <b>acceptors</b> out of which 39. 7 &#x 0025; accepted the intrauterine contraceptive device. The modal age group of the clients was 25 - 29 years (32. 5 &#x 0025;). Acceptance of intrauterine contraceptive device was most common among multiparous clients (65. 1 &#x 0025;). Majority of the acceptors were married (90. 0 &#x 0025;), Christians (98. 8 &#x 0025;) and 72. 8 &#x 0025; had at least secondary school education.

Twenty-two focus group discussions (FGDs) with married community members were carried out. Community Health Officers, Community Health Volunteers, and Health Care Managers were also interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were recorded digitally, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using QSR Nvivo 10 to compare contraceptive misconceptions in northern and southern Ghana. Results indicate that misconceptions {{associated with the use of}} contraceptives were widespread but similar in both settings. Contraceptives were perceived to predispose women to both primary and secondary infertility, uterine fibroids, and cancers. As regular menstrual flow was believed to prevent uterine fibroids, contraceptive use-related amenorrhea was thought to render acceptors vulnerable to uterine fibroids as well as cervical and breast cancers. <b>Contraceptive</b> <b>acceptors</b> were stigmatized and ridiculed as promiscuous. Among northern respondents, condom use was generally perceived to inhibit erection and therefore capable of inducing male impotence, while in southern Ghana, condom use was believed to reduce sensation and sexual gratification.

It is reversible, its use is independent of intercourse, and can be provided by trained non-medical staff making it particularly suitable for use in developing countries. The aim of this study is to determine the socio-demographic characteristics of its acceptors, the timing of use and complications at the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital, Uyo. Materials and Methods: The record cards of all clients who accepted {{medroxyprogesterone acetate}} injectable contraception over a nine-year period were studied. Results: There were 1065 new <b>contraceptive</b> <b>acceptors</b> out of which 166 (15. 1 &#x 0025;) accepted depot medroxyprogesterone acetate. The modal age group of the clients was 30 - 34 years (35. 0 &#x 0025;).

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the concept of {{informed}} choice in family planning and how numerical and systematic targeting aimed at raising the numbers of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>acceptors</b> fundamentally undermines this concept in highland Chiapas. The Government of Mexico’s policy aims within its Reproductive Health Programme (1995 - 2000) are to reduce the total fertility rate whilst promoting reproductive health services and family planning choices. Though Mexico has seen a decline in its total fertility rate attributed to increased contraceptive use in urban areas, in rural parts the rate remains high. Consequently, the rural poor, and in Chiapas overwhelmingly indigenous populations, have become a major target of the Reproductive Health Programme. Monthly targets are set for clinics and family planning services are offered systematically every time a woman attends a clinic for whatever reason. Amongst the factors which must be accounted for in assessing family planning provision in highland Chiapas are cultural differences between mestizo providers and the indigenous target groups as well as local economic and political conditions. Presently, the state of Chiapas is highly militarised and under the cloud of a low intensity war precipitated by the Zapatista uprising in 1994. The provision of any kind of health services is difficult under these situations, but more so what one considers the distrust sown between some indigenous communities and the government Who provide the health services. This thesis examines the practicalities of implementing a global policy at a local level and the constraints faced by both providers and intended recipients in the social context of Los Altos.

Objective: To review the profile of acceptors of combined {{oral contraceptive}} pills at the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital, Uyo. Methodology: An 8 year review of all clients that accepted combined oral contraceptive pills in the family planning clinic. Results: There were 1, 146 new <b>contraceptive</b> <b>acceptors</b> during the period of study out of which 309 (27. 9 %) accepted the pills. Majority of the clients were between 20 and 29 years of age (54. 0 %), were multiparous (72. 8 %), Christians (99. 7 %) and 61. 2 % had tertiary level education. Two hundred and fifty-five women (82. 5 %) desired to use combined oral contraceptive pills to space births while 7. 8 % wanted to limit child bearing. There was a high discontinuation rate among the women (45. 0 %) and out of these 87. 9 % of the clients changed to other contraceptive methods. All the clients commenced their pills within seven days of menstruation and only the low dose monophasic preparations were available in the family planning unit and thus were given to the clients. Conclusion: Women who accept to initiate combined oral contraceptive pills in our center are young, well educated, multiparous women who want to space their pregnancies.

Very little is known about continuation and switching of contraceptive methods in these settings. An evaluation of a contraceptive services program in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) was conducted to measure 12 -month contraceptive continuation by type of contraceptive method (short-acting or long-acting). A stratified systematic sample of women who initiated a contraceptive method 12 - 18 months prior to data collection was selected retrospectively from facility registers. A total of 548 women was interviewed about their contraceptive use: 304 who began a short-acting method (pills, injectables) and 244 who began a long-acting method (intra-uterine devices, implants). Key characteristics of short-acting method versus long-acting method acceptors were compared using chi-square statistics for categorical data and t-tests for continuous data. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios were estimated to assess factors associated with discontinuation. At 12 months, 81. 6 % women reported using their baseline contraceptive method continuously, with more long-acting than short-acting <b>contraceptive</b> <b>acceptors</b> (86. 1 % versus 78. 0 %, p =. 02) continuing contraceptive use.
