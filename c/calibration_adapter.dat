40|$|With the {{development}} of science and technology, the traditional artificial detection methods cannot {{meet the requirements of}} modern equipment testing and calibration. Combined with the actual demand, a kind of circuit boards calibration system are put forward. It can to realize automatic testing and calibration of the circuit boards. Many functions of the calibration system such as automatic testing, self-test and monitoring are summarized. The hardware is introduced which including the industrial computer system, <b>calibration</b> <b>adapter</b> and so on. Then, development platform, the thought of program design and the structure of the software are introduced in detail. The function of automatic calibration to specific circuit boards are realized. Because the system has good commonality and easy to extend to upgrade, {{the development}} ideas and experiences can be applied to similar circuit boards automatic testing system...|$|E
