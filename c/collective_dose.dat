The average dose is estimated to have been 120 millisieverts (12 rem) and 85% of the recorded doses were between 20 and 500 millisieverts (2 to 50 rems). There are large uncertainties in these individual doses; estimates {{of the size of}} the uncertainty range from 50% to a factor of five and dose records for military personnel are thought to be biased toward high values. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) estimates the total <b>collective</b> <b>dose</b> to the total of about 530,000 recovery operations workers as about 60,000 person-sieverts (6,000,000 person-rem).|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Australian {{scientists}} Keith Wise and John Moroney of the Australian Radiation Laboratory {{estimated that}} the <b>Collective</b> <b>dose</b> to the Australian population due to the test was 110 man-sieverts, statistically enough to have caused one death from cancer. Of the 1,518 personnel involved who were issued with film badges, 1,263 recorded no measurable amount of radiation, and 14 recorded 5 millisieverts (mS) {{over the course of}} the whole operation. None recorded more than 50 mS. Dosimeters and film badges were not issued to the crews of the RAAF Lincolns who gathered radioactive samples, but later experience showed that exposure would not have been medically significant. Studies of British veterans of all nuclear tests in 1983, 1988, 1993 and 2003 did not find conclusive evidence of increased mortality or health effects.|$|E
2500|$|The {{health effects}} of the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear {{accident}} are widely, but not universally, agreed to be very low. The American Nuclear Society concluded that average local radiation exposure was equivalent to a chest X-ray, and maximum local exposure equivalent to less than a year's background radiation. The U.S. BEIR report on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation states that [...] "he <b>collective</b> <b>dose</b> equivalent resulting from the radioactivity released in the Three Mile Island accident was so low that the estimated number of excess cancer cases to be expected, if any were to occur, would be negligible and undetectable." [...] A variety of epidemiology studies {{have concluded that the}} accident has had no observable long term health effects. One dissenting study is [...] "A reevaluation of cancer incidence near the Three Mile Island nuclear plant" [...] by Dr. Steven Wing of the University of North Carolina. In this study, Dr. Wing and his colleagues argue that earlier findings had [...] "logical and methodological problems" [...] and conclude that [...] "cancer incidence, specifically lung cancer and leukemia, increased following the TMI accident in areas estimated to have been in the pathway of radioactive plumes than in other areas." ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The aim {{of present}} study was to {{estimate}} effective dose from most common procedures performed in nuclear medicine departments of Golestan province.
