40|$|Metal casting {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} operations in ferroalloys factories. After the tapping of the furnace and the depuration of the metal, the preparation for customers with cooling, crushing and sizing begins. In total production costs, this contains around 8 % of the total cost of the metal, depending on the value of the fines and other important parameters. From an investment point of view, this represents around 20 % of the total capital for a new furnace. Casting onto a water-refrigerated copper plate is not new for molten metals. In steel, continuous casting machines are normal in every factory. Water granulation casting exists at some ferroalloys plants. However, the majority of plants and production technology still use the technology of lumping, crushing and sizing. This technology is time consuming, produces fines and requires a relatively large work force. In 2001, Ferroatlantica put into operation a new water-cooled copper <b>casting-machine,</b> which seems to be a very convenient solution to solve all these problems. It is in operation at a silicon factory; the same place where the new ELSA electrode was developed for silicon metal production. This paper describes our experiences using it...|$|E
