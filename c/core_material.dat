5|$|In another study, {{students}} who read less-organized material performed better that students given organized material on tasks that required {{an application of}} the knowledge to problem-solving. This suggests that the inclusion of seductive details might be beneficial for transfer performance but detrimental when trainees are recalling information. Interference from seductive details creates confusion of what the <b>core</b> <b>material</b> is and, therefore, the recall {{will not be as}} good and more errors will occur. This distortion can lead to a richer understanding of the material and facilitate transfer performance because trainees are required to form a macro structure of the instructional material. Research using the dual-coding paradigm also suggests that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and leads to deeper processing of information because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. When information is made easier to comprehend, material is processed less deeply, thus leading to poorer acquisition of information.|$|E

Nanoparticle properties depend {{not only on the}} composition of the <b>core</b> <b>material,</b> but also on varying thicknesses of material used. Magnetic properties are particularly useful in molecule manipulation, and thus metals are often used as <b>core</b> <b>material.</b> Metals contain inherent magnetic properties that allow for manipulation of molecular assembly. As nanoparticles interact with molecules via ligand properties, molecular assembly can be controlled by external magnetic fields interacting with magnetic properties in the nanoparticles.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} that result from these long development times and high costs is making accurate cores repeatably. This is extremely important because the core {{is an integral part}} of the mold, so essentially each shot is into a new mold cavity. Another difficulty is keeping the core from melting when the plastic is shot into the mold, because the plastic is approximately twice the melting temperature of the <b>core</b> <b>material.</b> A third difficulty is the low strength of the core. Hollow plastic cores can collapse if too much pressure is used in the shot plastic. Metal cores (with low melting temperatures) are solid so they cannot collapse, but are only 10% as strong as steel cores so they can distort. This is especially a problem when molding manifolds, because the waviness of the core can be detrimental to the airflow within the runners.|$|E

40|$|In {{the recent}} past, {{advances}} {{have been made}} in the attempt to utilize composite materials as components in protective structures such as those employed by the Air Force to secure critical military assets. In such applications, where lightweight materials that exhibit large levels of energy absorption and high strength/stiffness characteristics are desirable, composite sandwich constructions offer an attractive solution. In an attempt to evaluate the suitability of certain sandwich structures for use in force protection applications, several sandwich constructions with somewhat novel <b>core</b> <b>materials</b> were identified. A group of thermoplastic <b>core</b> <b>materials</b> have been developed that possess features of both a dense elastic solid and a foam type material. This class of <b>core</b> <b>materials</b> incorporates sloping cell walls, rather than the traditional parallel cell wall structure present in, say, a regular aluminum honeycomb. This feature, along with the increased surface area connectivity present between cells (produced by the forming process used to create the <b>core</b> <b>materials)</b> integrates surrounding cells into what may be described as an enhanced hexagonal single unit cell structure. To develop a preliminary understanding of the response of these enhanced cellular materials to the various loading regimes that could be encountered in a protective structure, a series of static and dynamic tests were conducted at Tyndall Air Force Base. A complete description of the novel <b>core</b> <b>materials,</b> as well as the results of the static and dynamic tests, will be presented in this paper...|$|R

Ida carried away insignificant amounts of this <b>core</b> <b>material.</b> It is uncertain how long ago the disruption event occurred.

However, this is inconsistent with the estimated age of the Ida–Dactyl system of less than 100 million years; it is unlikely that Dactyl, due to its small size, could have escaped being destroyed in a major collision for longer. The difference in age estimates may be explained by an increased rate of cratering from the debris of the Koronis parent body's destruction.|$|E

The FRP skins resist the tensile and compressive stresses resulting from the flexure induced by transverse loadings and the core resists shear stresses, serves as insulation, and separates the FRP skins at a desired distance to provide required moment of inertial.

In 1890, the oldest continuing American course in the modern tradition began at the University of Kansas, lectured by Frank W. Blackmar. The Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago was established in 1892 by Albion Small, who also published the first sociology textbook: An introduction to the study of society 1894. George Herbert Mead and Charles Cooley, who had met at the University of Michigan in 1891 (along with John Dewey), would move to Chicago in 1894. Their influence gave rise to social psychology and the symbolic interactionism of the modern Chicago School. The American Journal of Sociology was founded in 1895, followed by the American Sociological Association (ASA) in 1905. The sociological [...] "canon of classics" [...] with Durkheim and Max Weber at the top owes in part to Talcott Parsons, who is largely credited with introducing both to American audiences.
