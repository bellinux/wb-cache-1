He also has a <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think.

40|$|<b>Clearing</b> <b>and</b> {{settlement}} {{systems are}} essential to the smooth functioning of a modern market-based economy such as Canada's. During the past decade, there have been significant efforts in Canada and abroad to improve electronic <b>clearing</b> <b>and</b> settlement systems that handle payments obligations, either uniquely or in conjunction with transactions related to the purchase and sale of a broad range of financial instruments such as debt, equity, foreign exchange, or derivatives. This article examines some of the risks faced by participants and end-users of these systems and reviews the Bank of Canada's role in relation to these systems. For a number of years, the Bank has been involved informally with major <b>clearing</b> <b>and</b> settlement systems with a view to ensuring that systemic risk is adequately controlled. In July 1996, the Payment <b>Clearing</b> <b>and</b> Settlement Act was proclaimed. This Act formalized the role of the Bank in the oversight of <b>clearing</b> <b>and</b> settlement systems for the purpose of controlling systemic risk. The article provides an overview of the Bank's responsibilities. It also describes certain new powers that the Act made available to the Bank that could be exercised in its dealings with <b>clearing</b> <b>and</b> settlement systems. ...|$|R

In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, The Edge of the Sea, which focuses on life in coastal ecosystems (particularly along the Eastern Seaboard). It appeared in The New Yorker in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by Houghton Mifflin (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> poetical prose was well established; The Edge of the Sea received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for The Sea Around Us.|$|E

5|$|In the {{so-called}} modern {{synthesis of the}} early 20th century, Ronald Fisher brought together Darwin's theory of evolution, with its insistence on natural selection, heredity, and variation, and Gregor Mendel's laws of genetics into a coherent structure for evolutionary biology. Biologists assumed that an organism was a straightforward reflection of its component genes: the genes coded for proteins, which built the organism's body. Biochemical pathways (and, they supposed, new species) evolved through mutations in these genes. It was a simple, <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> nearly comprehensive picture: {{but it did not}} explain embryology.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to clarify the likely {{consequences}} of settlement internalisation by custodian banks with respect to the competitive nature of the (<b>clearing</b> <b>and)</b> settlement industry, regardless of the extent of internalisation that is actually carried out. The intuition of the model presented in this paper is based on the assumption that the CSD knows the investors' final demand of (<b>clearing</b> <b>and)</b> settlement services, even though it is only faced with a fraction of such demand, i. e. the investors' final demand that is not internalised by custodians. As a consequence, the CSD's monopoly power is not constrained by the possibility of custodian banks internalising part of the (<b>clearing</b> <b>and)</b> settlement activity. The model structurally differentiates the (<b>clearing</b> <b>and)</b> settlement activity of the CSD from that of custodians. The difference between the (<b>clearing</b> <b>and)</b> settlement activity of the CSD and that of custodians refers to the fact that the (<b>clearing</b> <b>and)</b> settlement activity of the CSD is the highest or primary level where settlement can be achieved. To the extent that the probability of settlement internalisation is less than one, not all settlements are internalised. As a consequence of this, the CSD can adjust its price to take into consideration the level of settlement internalisation, making it irrelevant from the point of view of its profits. As regards the appropriate market definitions, the paper proposes to apply to the settlement industry the classical distinction between “production” and “distribution” of services. It then tests such a distinction against the Commission Communication on <b>clearing</b> <b>and</b> settlement of April 2004, the industry Code of Conduct – to clarify the extent to which they can be interpreted as promoting competition in the sector – and against the Commission decision on Clearstream. <b>Clearing</b> <b>and</b> settlement; settlement internalisation; central securities depositories; monopoly; competition...|$|R

5|$|Most {{living things}} have predators and {{therefore}} {{are in a}} constant evolutionary arms race to develop antipredator adaptations, while the predator adapts to become more efficient at defeating the prey's adaptations.

Others have developed chemical defences such as the deadly toxins of certain snakes and wasps, or the noxious scent of the skunk. Such prey often send <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> honest warning signals to their attackers with conspicuous aposematic (warning) patterns.
