5000|$|A {{geometric}} lathe {{was used}} for making ornamental patterns on the plates used in printing bank notes and postage stamps. It is sometimes called a guilloché lathe. It was developed early {{in the nineteenth century}} when efforts were introduced to combat forgery, and is an adaptation of an ornamental <b>turning</b> <b>lathe.</b> The lathe was able to generate intersecting and interlacing patterns of fine lines in various shapes, which were almost impossible to forge by hand-engraving. They were used by many national mints.|$|R

50|$|Lynn’s father, Robert Frederick (1914-2012) is {{the founder}} of the Lynn Historic Woodworking Trust Inc. a {{collection}} of historic woodworking tools, equipment and archives, including the world’s largest collection of ornamental <b>turning</b> <b>lathes.</b> It is sited at The Plains, a colonial era museum park in Ashburton, NZ.

50|$|The {{ornamental}} <b>turning</b> <b>lathe</b> {{was developed}} {{around the same}} time as the industrial screw-cutting lathe in the nineteenth century. It was used not for making practical objects, but for decorative work - ornamental turning. By using accessories such as the horizontal and vertical cutting frames, eccentric chuck and elliptical chuck, solids of extraordinary complexity may be produced by various generative procedures.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the wing}} and {{fuselage}} {{were made of}} wood, Joe also discovered he would need both a circular and jig saw to fabricate the various pieces, so he bought those also. Next, telling his wife he needed a wood <b>turning</b> <b>lathe</b> to [...] "build furniture," [...] he purchased that as well. He was then on his way, the project taking shape in his garage after work and on weekends.|$|R
50|$|A {{four-stroke}} {{spark-ignition engine}} is an Otto cycle engine. It consists of following four strokes: suction or intake stroke, compression stroke, expansion or power stroke, exhaust stroke. Each stroke consists of 180 degree rotation of crankshaft rotation and hence a four-stroke cycle is completed through 720 degree of crank rotation. Thus for one complete cycle {{there is only}} one power stroke while the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>turns</b> by two revolutions.|$|R
25|$|As {{the engine}} <b>crankshaft</b> <b>turns,</b> it also turns the {{distributor}} shaft at half the speed. In a four-stroke engine, the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>turns</b> twice for the ignition cycle. A multi-lobed cam {{is attached to}} the distributor shaft; there is one lobe for each engine cylinder. A spring-loaded rubbing block follows the lobed portions of the cam contour and controls the opening and closing of points. During most of the cycle, the rubbing block keeps the points closed to allow a current to build in the ignition coil's primary winding. As a piston reaches the top of the engine's compression cycle, the cam's lobe is high enough to cause the breaker points to open. Opening the points causes the current through the primary coil to stop. Without the steady current through the primary, the magnetic field generated in the coil immediately collapses. This high rate of change of magnetic flux induces a high voltage in the coil's secondary windings that ultimately causes the spark plug's gap to arc and ignite the fuel.|$|R
50|$|In 1839 (age 23) {{while working}} for B. Hick and Son, John Hick Jr as he was {{referred}} to at the time, was awarded the Silver Medal by the Society of Arts for his novel invention of an expanding mandrel for <b>turning</b> <b>lathes,</b> it was an adaptation of a principle developed by Marc Brunel for pully block manufacture at Portsmouth and received the praise of three eminent engineers; Bryan Donkin, Joshua Field and John Rennie.|$|R
5000|$|Further {{development}} of the first test engines led to the DB 604A/B. The only difference between the DB 604A and the DB 604B - as with the similarly suffixed A and B versions of the DB 606 and 610 [...] "coupled" [...] power system engines - was {{the direction in which}} the DB 604's <b>crankshaft</b> <b>turned.</b> The DB 604A/B was equipped with a two-speed supercharger, achieving 1,835 kW (2,500 hp) whilst testing.|$|R

At one time the village had a hotel, a general store, two blacksmith shops and a <b>turning</b> <b>lathe</b> shop. A post office was established there in 1876.

40|$|The {{basic concept}} of {{internal}} combustion engine is a cylinder, which is closed at one end, is filled {{with a mixture of}} fuel and air. As the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>turns</b> it pushes cylinder. The piston is forced up and compresses the mixture {{in the top of the}} cylinder. The mixture is set alight and, as it burns, it creates a gas. pressure on the piston, forcing it down the cylinder. This paper gives a review of compression ignition engine...|$|R
