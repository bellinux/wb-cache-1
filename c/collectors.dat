40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Some {{desirable}} {{features of}} a solar energy <b>collector</b> are listed and a <b>collector</b> design is presented which incorporates their features. As the <b>collector</b> is operated, air flows within the <b>collector</b> enclosure and is heated as it passes through a porous radiant energy receiver mounted in the enclosure. The porous energy receiver consists of sheets of blackened expanded metal. A hardware model of the experimental <b>collector</b> was constructed to allow comparison of this design with a typical flat-plate air-heating <b>collector.</b> Testing demonstrated that the experimental <b>collector</b> was approximately twice as efficient as the standard flat-plate <b>collector.</b> This performance differential was largely due to manipulation of airflow paths within the enclosure of the experimental <b>collector.</b> A mathematical model of the experimental <b>collector</b> was developed and correlated to the hardware model. This hardware-software correlation provided insight into the radiant energy and airflow distributions within the porous receiver and enabled investigation of the sensitivity of <b>collector</b> performance to changes in design parameters such as air flowrate, receiver sheet thermal conductivity, etc. The material cost for the experimental <b>collector</b> is approximately 3 - 4 per square foot (1979 prices).
