5|$|The {{two ships}} were based in {{southern}} Italy during World War I {{to help ensure}} that the Austro-Hungarian Navy surface fleet would be contained in the Adriatic. Neither vessel saw any combat during the conflict. After the war, they cruised the Mediterranean and were involved in several international incidents, including at Corfu in 1923. In 1933, both ships were placed in reserve. In 1937 the ships began a lengthy reconstruction. The modifications included removing their <b>center</b> <b>main</b> battery turret and boring {{out the rest of}} the guns to , strengthening their armor protection, installing new boilers and steam turbines, and lengthening their hulls. The reconstruction work lasted until 1940, by which time Italy was already engaged in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Weissenburg and Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm were armored with {{nickel steel}} Krupp armor, {{but due to}} {{delivery}} problems, Brandenburg and Wörth were armored with a composite armor. The composite armor was constructed by layering steel-clad wrought iron plates and wood planks, which was backed by two more layers of sheet iron. Krupp's nickel steel armor {{was based on the}} Harvey process, which enriched the upper layers of the steel with carbon. This type of armor produced greater strength with thinner armor belts, which enabled ships equipped with it to carry more complete protection. Some portions of Brandenburg did receive the new Krupp armor, including the barbettes that held the fore and <b>center</b> <b>main</b> battery turrets. All four ships retained teak backing to their armor belts.|$|E
5|$|The bridge's {{fourteen}} spans extended 1,907feet (580m) long. The {{three main}} spans were of deck truss construction while {{all but two}} of the eleven approach spans were steel multi-girder construction, the two exceptions being concrete slab construction. The piers were not built in the navigation channel; instead, the center span of the bridge consisted of a single 458-foot (140m) steel arched truss over the 390-foot (119m) channel. The two support piers for the main trusses, each with two load-bearing concrete pylons at either side of the <b>center</b> <b>main</b> span, were located on opposite banks of the river. The center span was connected to the north and south approaches by shorter spans formed by the same main trusses. Each was 266feet (81m) in length, and was connected to the approach spans by a 38foot (11.6m) cantilever. The two main trusses, one on either side, ranged in depth from 60feet (18.3m) above their pier and concrete pylon supports, to 36feet (11m) at midspan on the central span and 30feet (9m) deep at the outer ends of the adjoining spans. At the top of the main trusses were the deck trusses, 12feet (3.6m) in depth and integral with the main trusses. The transverse deck beams, part of the deck truss, rested on top of the main trusses. These deck beams supported longitudinal deck stringers 27inches (69cm) in depth, and reinforced-concrete pavement. The deck was 113ft 4in (34.5m) in breadth and was split longitudinally. It had transverse expansion joints at the centers and ends of each of the three main spans. The roadway deck was approximately 115feet (35m) above the water level.|$|E

500|$|The {{ships were}} {{modified}} {{several times in}} the interwar period. In 1919, Bretagne was equipped with a heavy tripod mast; Provence and Lorraine were given tripod masts in the early 1920s. Four of Bretagnes boilers were converted to oil-firing in 1924, and half of Provences boilers in the rear boiler room were similarly converted in 1927. Bretagne subsequently had six new oil-fired boilers to replace the rest of the old coal-fired boilers, and her direct drive turbines were replaced with Parsons geared turbines. Provence was similarly modified in 1931–1934. Lorraines propulsion system was improved in a similar pattern. In 1935, [...] "Lorraine" [...] had her <b>center</b> <b>main</b> battery turret was replaced with an aircraft catapult and a hangar for three aircraft. These were initially Gourdou-Leseurre GL-819 and Potez 452 seaplanes, though they were replaced with the Loire 130 flying boat. In March–May 1944, the aircraft installation was removed.|$|E
500|$|In the interwar period, {{all three}} ships had their {{armament}} rearranged. In 1919–1920, Bretagne had the four forwardmost of her 138mm guns removed, {{along with the}} 75mm {{and two of the}} 47mm guns. In their place, four 75mm mle 1897 guns were installed on the forward superstructure. Twenty-four [...] Hotchkiss machine guns were installed on the forecastle deck in 1927. The four rearmost 138mm guns were removed during this refit, along with the 75mm guns, which were replaced with eight 75mm mle 1922 anti-aircraft guns. Sixteen 13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine guns, in quadruple mounts, were also added. Provence had her four forward 138mm guns removed in 1919, and was equipped similarly to Bretagne. In 1931–1934, she received the same eight 75mm guns as Bretagne did, and in 1940, three quadruple mounts of 13.2mm guns were fitted. Lorraine followed a similar pattern, though in 1935, her <b>center</b> <b>main</b> battery turret was removed; an aircraft catapult was fitted in its place. At this time, four [...] Model M1930 guns were added, along with two of the 13.2mm quadruple mounts. In 1940, the 100mm guns were removed to arm the new battleship Richelieu, and eight 75mm M1922 guns replaced them. In March–May 1944, fourteen [...] and twenty-five [...] guns in single mounts were added, and the quadruple 13.2mm guns were removed.|$|E
