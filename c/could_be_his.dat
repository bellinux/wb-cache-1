5|$|After {{some initial}} resistance, the Duke yields to Süß's {{request for the}} repeal of the law prohibiting Jews from living in Württemberg; a horde of dirty, disreputable Jews are then shown moving into the city. Süß enables them to enrich {{themselves}} {{at the expense of the}} populace. The aged Rabbi Loew (Werner Krauss) criticizes Süß for his excessively opulent lifestyle as the Duke's finance minister and warns that it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> downfall, warning that, “The Lord punishes Jews who forget who they are!” but Süß pays him no heed.|$|E
5|$|Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir (Out of {{the depths}} I call, Lord, to You), , is a church cantata by the German {{composer}} Johann Sebastian Bach. It was composed in either 1707 or 1708, {{which makes it}} one of Bach's earliest cantatas. Some sources suggest that it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> earliest surviving work in this form, but current thinking {{is that there are}} one or two earlier examples.|$|E

In August 2013, Stevens was charged by the ICC for failing to report two corrupt approaches in connection to games in the BPL. The charges were connected to allegations of match fixing within the Gladiators organisation which saw a total of nine people charged by the ICC. In the last game of the 2013 season, Stevens hit 205 not out and believed that the knock <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> last ever innings.

The painter {{was thought to be}} a self-portrait of the artist; Jean-Louis Vaudoyer suggested the young woman <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> daughter. The painter sits in front of the painting on the easel, where you can see the sketch of the crown. He is dressed in an elegant black garment with cuts on the sleeves and on the back that offers a glimpse of the shirt underneath. He has short puffy breeches and orange stockings, an expensive and fashionable garment that is also found in other works of the time, as in a well-known self-portrait by Rubens.|$|E
25|$|Between 1888 and 1890, Narendra visited Vaidyanath in Allahabad. In January 1890 he {{went from}} Allahabad to Ghazipur and met Pavhari Baba, an Advaita Vedanta ascetic who {{spent much of his}} time in meditation. At the time he {{suffered}} from lumbago, and it was becoming impossible for him to move or sit in meditation. After meeting Baba, Narendra wanted to become his disciple and Baba asked him to stay a few more days at Ghazipur. However, the night before his initiation Narendra had a dream in which Ramakrishna looked at him with a melancholy face. This dream convinced Narendra that no one other than Ramakrishna <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> teacher, and he abandoned the idea of becoming Baba's disciple.|$|E
25|$|Man Ray {{displayed}} {{artistic and}} mechanical abilities during childhood. His education at Brooklyn's Boys' High School from 1904 to 1909 {{provided him with}} solid grounding in drafting and other basic art techniques. While he attended school, he educated himself with frequent visits to the local art museums, where he studied {{the works of the}} Old Masters. After his graduation, Ray was offered a scholarship to study architecture but chose to pursue a career as an artist. Man Ray's parents were disappointed by their son's decision to pursue art, but they agreed to rearrange the family's modest living quarters so that Ray's room <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> studio. The artist remained in the family home over the next four years. During this time, he worked steadily towards becoming a professional painter. Man Ray earned money as a commercial artist and was a technical illustrator at several Manhattan companies.|$|E

25|$|Rosa first appears when George Palmer (Paul Moriarty) and Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) attend her husband's {{funeral in}} January 1998, and later moves to Walford in February 1998 {{along with the}} rest of her family. She sets up her own {{restaurant}} called Giuseppe's, named after her late husband. George helped to set this up. It was later revealed that she and George had a fling many years ago during the time her husband Giuseppe was in prison. This leads George to believe that Rosa's son Gianni <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> son rather than Giuseppe's. This shock leads to Gianni breaking up with George's daughter Annie Palmer (Nadia Sawalha) after fearing they had been having an incestuous affair. DNA tests later confirm that Gianni is Giuseppe's son which relieves both Rosa and Gianni. Jeff Healy (Leslie Schofield) had a crush on her but Rosa rejects his advances. Nicky later gets food poisoning from the local café and Rosa tries to have it closed down.|$|E
25|$|Vijay soon discovers {{how quickly}} {{the media and the}} public can make a villain out of a hero. Unable to bear the shock and humiliation, Ram suffers a brain hemorrhage. Nandini takes the {{responsibility}} to care for Ram and take in Vijay. Vijay and Nandini fly to Australia to have surgery on his back. The surgery is successful and Vijay soon realises that Nandini, his childhood friend, <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> life partner. He nurtures his feelings for her but Nandini is still healing after Vijay's bad side took over and is finding it hard to trust him and behave like his true friend again. They return to Jaisalmer and Vijay vows to be a better cricketer for his country. He proves himself to his father and Nandini that he can play for his country and his coach relies on him too. He gets selected once again to play in the major international cricket tournament. He injures himself whilst playing but vows to play no matter his health. He wins the cricket tournament and returns to his hometown Jaisalmer, to see his father and Nandini. Vijay and his father reconcile and just when everything is going fine Ram dies in Vijay's arms. They hold the funeral and we see Vijay and Nandini comforting each other in the end scene. We assume they get together. And it finishes with Vijay once again playing in a cricket tournament and playing for his country.|$|E
25|$|He {{signed a}} $120 million seven-year {{extension}} deal after the 2009 {{season in the}} largest contract in Cardinals' history. He averaged 147 games played {{for the first five}} years, but injuries severely hurt his playing time in 2015 and this year. He posted five 20-homer seasons and four 90-RBI seasons. Holliday produced a cumulative WAR of 24.1 in those eight years. According to Fangraphs, which created a tool to convert WAR to dollars in order to estimate the value of a player, Holliday has been worth $168.6 million since 2010. He was active in the community with many charity appearances. He will turn 37 in mid-January 2017, after playing 13 major league seasons, the first five with the Colorado Rockies, and first half of 2009 with the Oakland Athletics until traded on July 24 to the Cardinals. After what <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> final at-bat with the Cardinals at home on September 30, against the Pittsburgh Pirates, he hit his first ever pinch-hit home run, his 20th of the season, giving him 61 RBIs for the season, in his 980th game with the Cardinals that included six 20-homer seasons. With his 20th home run, Holliday became the sixth Cardinals' player to reach that mark, tying the NL record held by the 1965 Milwaukee Braves, and later 2003 Atlanta Braves. The homer also extended the team's pinch-hit home run major league record, now 17.|$|E

500|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Abdallah al-Battal's origin or early life. Much later {{accounts}} claim that he hailed from Antioch or Damascus, {{and that he was}} a mawla of the Umayyad family. He is also given various kunya, Abu Muhammad, Abu Yahya, or Abu 'l-Husayn, by which he is usually known. The use of the nisba of al-Antaqi ("of Antioch") rather than a tribal affiliation suggests that he may not have been of Arab origin; in this context, his name [...] "Abdallah" [...] further suggests that he was a convert to Islam, as this name (meaning [...] "servant of Allah") was often given to new converts in early Islamic times. Khalid Yahya Blankinship suggested that he might be the same person as a certain [...] "'Amr" [...] recorded by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor in the Nicaea campaign of 727, and hence that [...] "'Amr" [...] <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> actual personal name or a patronymic (i.e. his name could be 'Amr ibn Abdallah or Abdallah ibn 'Amr), while alternatively [...] "Abdallah" [...] could simply be an honorific.|$|E

[...] Shetler concluded that [...] "every element of the song works, from the sweet whistling intro to the acoustic guitar melody to the 'oh-oh-oh-oh' vocal chants after the chorus." [...] Similarly, Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV, who viewed [...] "It Girl" [...] as Derulo's [...] "valiant attempt to trump his monstrous [...] hit 'Whatcha Say', gave the song a positive review, writing that it is catchy and it is [...] "perfectly crafted for radio success". Jess Holton of The Music Network noted that the song [...] "delivers with catchy whistling and tender lyrics" [...] and that it [...] "will appeal to the lady fans of Derulo who {{like to see the}} romantic side of the crooner". Robbie Daw of Idolator wrote that the song [...] "comes dangerously close to being just another bland, cookie cutter R experience, but lucky for him, that whistle gimmick in the chorus makes it a somewhat enjoyable three minutes." ...|$|E

He tells Milton that he is his son, after Milton admitted to sleeping with his mother, Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch), around the time Jack was conceived. Milton is happy to have him as his son, and reveals to Jack that he is in need of a kidney transplant.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the cancellation, Anderson was {{required}} {{to come up with an}} idea for another Supermarionation series. He had once been inspired by the thought of creating a live-action police drama in which the hero would have unexpectedly been murdered halfway through the series and replaced by a new lead character. Now giving fresh consideration to this idea, Anderson resolved that a selling point for his new series could be a character that can be killed at the end of each episode and resurrected by the beginning of the next. This, coupled with contemporary theories about the possibility of life on Mars, led to the idea of an interplanetary war raging between Earth and its neighbour and a worldwide security organisation being called on to defend human civilisation. After further thought, Anderson decided that [...] "Scarlet" [...] would make an unusual codename for this organisation's [...] "indestructible" [...] agent who can come back to life, while [...] "Blue" [...] <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> partner's designation. From this, Anderson reasoned that all the personnel should have colours for names so as to form the whole [...] "Spectrum" [...] of colours, and decided that someone called [...] "White" [...] should be the leader of the Spectrum Organisation, much in the same way that white light is composed of, and can be broken down into, the colours of the spectrum.|$|E
500|$|On April 7, 2010, Rentería {{had five}} hits (in five at-bats) in a 10–4 victory over Houston. He started the season well, {{as he was}} batting [...]320 through April 30. However, on April 30, {{he was forced to}} leave a game against Colorado after two innings with an injured groin. After missing four games, he {{returned}} to the lineup on May 6, but he left that game after two innings when he reinjured the groin. He was placed on the disabled list the next day. He was activated from the DL on May 22, but, after three games, he strained a hamstring on May 25 and was placed on the disabled list again the next day. He returned to the Giants on June 19. However, he returned to the disabled list on August 11 with a biceps injury received the previous night. He returned to the Giants on September 1, but Giants' manager Bruce Bochy announced that Juan Uribe, who had been playing well while substituting for Rentería at short, would remain the starting shortstop, which made Rentería a reserve player. He had four hits on September 16, in a 10–2 win over the Dodgers. On September 23, with the Giants trailing San Diego in the NL West, Rentería delivered a speech during a team meeting in which he told his teammates it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> last year, and he wanted the Giants to make the playoffs. The Giants managed to overtake San Diego, and they did make the playoffs. Rentería finished the year with career-lows in games (72), hits (67), home runs (three, tied with his 1998 total), and RBI (22). During the season, he also began contemplating retirement.|$|E
