25|$|Rocket engines {{employ the}} {{principle}} of jet propulsion. The rocket engines powering rockets come in {{a great variety of}} different types; a comprehensive list can be found in rocket engine. Most current rockets are chemically powered rockets (usually internal combustion engines, but some employ a decomposing monopropellant) that emit a hot exhaust gas. A rocket engine can use gas propellants, solid propellant, liquid propellant, or a hybrid mixture of both solid and liquid. Some rockets use heat or pressure that is supplied from a source other than the chemical reaction of propellant(s), such as steam rockets, solar thermal rockets, nuclear thermal rocket engines or simple pressurized rockets such as water rocket or cold gas thrusters. With <b>combustive</b> propellants a chemical reaction is initiated between the fuel and the oxidizer in the combustion chamber, and the resultant hot gases accelerate out of a rocket engine nozzle (or nozzles) at the rearward-facing end of the rocket. The acceleration of these gases through the engine exerts force ("thrust") on the combustion chamber and nozzle, propelling the vehicle (according to Newton's Third Law). This actually happens because the force (pressure times area) on the combustion chamber wall is unbalanced by the nozzle opening; {{this is not the case}} in any other direction. The shape of the nozzle also generates force by directing the exhaust gas along the axis of the rocket.|$|E

60|$|Even now, {{after all}} the {{brilliant}} discoveries from Scheele, Priestley, and Cavendish, to Berzelius and Davy, no improvement {{has been made in}} this division,--not of primary bodies (those idols of the modern atomic chemistry), but of causes, as Sir T.B. rightly expresses them,--that is, of elementary powers manifested in bodies. Let mercury stand for the bi-polar metallic principle, best imaged as a line or 'axis' from north to south,--the north or negative pole being the cohesive or coherentific force, and the south or positive pole being the dispersive or incoherentific force: the first is predominant in, and therefore represented by, carbon,--the second by nitrogen; and the series of metals are the primary and, hence, indecomponible 'syntheta' and proportions of both. In like manner, sulphur represents the active and passive principle of fire: the contractive force, or negative electricity--oxygen--produces flame; and the dilative force, or positive electricity--hydrogen--produces warmth. And lastly, salt is the equilibrium or compound of the two former. So taken, salt, sulphur, and mercury are equivalent to the <b>combustive,</b> the combustible, and the combust, under one or other of which all known bodies, or ponderable substances, may be classed and distinguished.|$|E

50|$|Scramjet engines {{operate on}} the same {{principles}} as ramjets, but do not decelerate the flow to subsonic velocities. Rather, a scramjet combustor is supersonic: the inlet decelerates the flow to a lower Mach number for combustion, after which it is accelerated to an even higher Mach number through the nozzle. By limiting the amount of deceleration, temperatures within the engine are kept at a tolerable level, from both a material and <b>combustive</b> standpoint.

50|$|The initial {{economic}} {{cost of building}} materials is the purchase price. This is often what governs decision making about what materials to use.

For example, an asphalt shingle roof costs less than a metal roof to install, but the metal roof will last longer so the lifetime cost is less per year. Some materials may require more care than others, maintaining costs specific to some materials may also influence the final decision. Risks when considering lifetime cost of a material is if the building is damaged such as by fire or wind, or if the material is not as durable as advertised.

5000|$|One common way to {{extinguish}} a fire is to spray it with water.

This leaves the fire without enough of the <b>combustive</b> agent, and it dies out.

40|$|Mechanochemical {{reactions}} {{have been}} identified as a valuable alternative to conventional methodologies for the degradation of toxic pollutants as well as for their abatement in contaminated matrices. This paper discusses the application of the mechanochernical technique to the degradation of sulfonic acids in a contaminated matrix. The degradation of the pollutant compound was carried out by taking advantage of <b>combustive</b> reactions on a suitable reactive system ignited under mechanical treatment conditions. Two systems have been investigated as possible reactive substrates. The first one was a Mg-SiO 2 powder mixture while the second system was a Ca-SiO 2 powder mixture. Milling trials performed under different mechanical processing conditions allowed one to characterise the reactivity of these chemical systems, which basically undergo a reduction/oxidation reaction involving the formation of MgO and Si phases when the Mg-SiO 2 system is considered and CaO and Si phases when the Ca-SiO 2 system is employed, respectively. The systematic change of the stoichiometric ratios Mg:SiO 2 and Ca:SiO 2 permitted to identify the minimum Mg or Ca content necessary for the ignition of the <b>combustive</b> reactions. The experimental runs performed with such systems have shown a greater effectiveness of the Mg-SiO 2 because of less energy inputs required to ignite a combustion. For this reason the Mg-SiO 2 has been considered as a reactive substrate in the following trials. Since the SiO 2 amount in stoichiometric excess may be regarded as inert phase, it was substituted with a different phase consisting of the matrix contaminated by sulfonic acids. This aspect permitted to ignite a <b>combustive</b> reaction with the minimum possible content of Mg SiO 2 reacting mixture. The chemical analyses performed after the <b>combustive</b> reaction proved the complete removal of the sulfonic acid from the contaminated matrix. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Neutrophil leukocytes {{protect against}} a varied and complex array of {{microbes}} by providing microbicidal action that is simple, potent, and focused. Neutrophils provide such action via redox reactions {{that change the}} frontier orbitals of oxygen (O 2) facilitating combustion. The spin conservation rules define the symmetry barrier that prevents direct reaction of diradical O 2 with nonradical molecules, explaining why combustion is not spontaneous. In burning, the spin barrier is overcome when energy causes homolytic bond cleavage producing radicals capable of reacting with diradical O 2 to yield oxygenated radical products that further participate in reactive propagation. Neutrophil mediated combustion is by a different pathway. Changing the spin quantum state of O 2 removes the symmetry restriction to reaction. Electronically excited singlet molecular oxygen (O 2 * 1) is a potent electrophilic reactant with a finite lifetime that restricts its radius of reactivity and focuses <b>combustive</b> action on the target microbe. The resulting exergonic dioxygenation reactions produce electronically excited carbonyls that relax by light emission, that is, chemiluminescence.
