50|$|Dietrich von Bothmer {{dismissed}} the Plinian anecdote as an etiological embroidery invented {{to account for}} the five statues of wounded Amazons of varying styles. Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway presented her doubts ("it is difficult to see why all five Amazons were set up if only one 'won' and became the object of the dedication"), noting Pliny's awareness of the discrepancies in age of the sculptors; she presented an alternative, <b>cumulative</b> <b>origin,</b> building on fifth century prototypes, added to by Phradmon, whom she identifies as a fourth-century sculptor, and supplemented by later classicizing models.|$|E
40|$|The {{compositional}} and petrologic {{characteristics of}} the Johnstown meteorite show it to contain uncontaminated and unbrecciated orthopyroxenite clasts of <b>cumulative</b> <b>origin</b> that (1) must have undergone subsolidus recrystalization, (2) are parental to the brecciated matrix, and (3) show {{no evidence of a}} xenolithic, meteoritic contribution to the matrix except for contamination by the projectile which crushed it on impact. The trapped liquid was not introduced in the impact process. The variability of such trace elements as the light rare earth elements, and the presence of plagioclase and olivine in only one of the thin sections studied, demonstrates the heterogeneity of coarse-grained diogenites on a millimeter scale and the difficulty of obtaining representative samples of such meteorites. The data presented indicate that this meteorite is a monominct breccia...|$|E
40|$|A {{string of}} {{ophiolite}} and ultrnmafic gabbro complexes in western and northern Tasmania constitutes the Main Belt, while {{a second group}} in the Adamsfield area are composed entirely of ultramafics. These complexes are associated with Eocambrian and Cambrian sequences of mudstones, wackes, conglomerates and volcanic rocks lying between or flanking Proterozoic blocks. The Heazlewood River Complex, the largest and least dismembered in the Main Belt, is an ophiolite consisting of layered ultramafics intruded by gabbros and overlain by extrusive rocks. Dolerite dyke swarms intrude the ultramafics {{and part of the}} volcanic sequence, while tonalites, trondhjemites and granophyres intrude all other rock types. The rock contacts of the ultramafics with the Eocambrian Luina Beds are faulted and/ or have formed by solid flow of serpentinite. Contacts between the extrusive rocks and the Luina Beds are poorly exposed, but on the basis of established faults and melange zones it is tentatively concluded that the ophiolite is an allochthon. The Nineteen Mile Creek Dunites occurring along the NW margin of the Heazlewood River Complex are tectonites, some of which may be deformed cumulates. The rest of the ultramafics in the Hleazlewood River Complex and the other Main Belt bodies are dominantly layered orthopyroxenites, harzburgites, lherzolites and dunites, many of which contain interstitial plagioclase. Considered together, the layering styles, textures, and compositional ranges (Fo 79 - 89, En 79 - 89) of these rocks are consistent with a <b>cumulative</b> <b>origin.</b> It is suggested that nucleation (as opposed to mechanical sorting processes) and postcumulus diffusion are important controls on the layering. The layered ultramafics and gabbros of the Main Belt are believed to have formed by crystal accumulation from tholeiitic or high-Ilg tholeiitic magmas. Lack of olivine-plagioclase reactions suggest crystallization occurred at pressures less than 6 kb. The extrusive rocks of the Heazlewood River Complex are probably mainly basalts, but high-Ng basalts ao well as some intermediate and acid types also occur. The dolerites, which have suffered less than the volcanics from the pervasive hydrothermal or burial metamorphism, are quartz tholeiites which grade into granophyres and tonalites. Although similar to Cainozoic mid-ocean ridge basalts in Cr and Ni contents and being relatively low in the incompatible elements, the dolerites and volcanic rocks are dominantly quartz tholeiites rather than olivine tholeiites and have unusually low Ti 02 contents. Nevertheless it is concluded that the Heazlewood River Complex (and perhaps the other Main Belt complexes) may have formed as Eocambrian lithosphere at a mid-ocean ridge, marginal sea, or similar spreading environment. Detritus of ophiolite rocks in Cambrian sedimentary rocks in a number of localities suggests that the Main Belt complexes were tectonically emplaced prior to the commencement of Middle Cambrian sedimentation. It is suggested that the lenses of foliated amphibolites which occuur along the contacts of several complexes, may have formed by metamorphism of ophiolite rocks prior to, or {{in the early stages of}} the initial tectonic emplacement. As a result of a series of faulting, serpentinization and tectonic re-emplacement events, several of the Tasmanian Complex now occur as serpentinite lenses strung out along major fault zones, and in contact with sedimentary rocks as young as Silurian. The first serpentinization phases affecting the complexes preferentially replaced dunites and harzburgites by massive lizardite serpentinites, and altered gabbro layers and dykes to rodingites or amphibole-prehnite rocks. Characteristic massive and sheared varieties of green waxy-lustred serpentinites formed in later phases associated with deformation. These green serpentinites are lizardite-chrysotile mixtures, and in many localities contain cross-fibre asbestos veins which typically surround residual pyroxenite kernals...|$|E

40|$|Interpretation of {{the origin}} of groundwater, sampled and {{analysed}} in 2002 - 2003, in the SW part of the USCB – at the borderland of Poland and Czech Republic, has been performed being based on chemical and isotopic analyses. Mine water from Carboniferous aquifers (Poland) was identified as belonging to the following genetic types: the oldest type of Permian hot climate, paleoinfiltrated Tertiary water types of pre-Badenian and post-Badenian age, and Quaternary water types. Several mixed types of the above-mentioned ones were also ascertained. Recent natural (or technological) waters mix together with waters of the deeper parts of the rock massif. Miocene water from the Czech part of the USCB may be derived from Miocene seawater mixed with water types of another <b>origin.</b> <b>Cumulative</b> mine water from the Ostrava and the Petřvald parts of USCB basin (troughs) are formed by water from the coarse clastic Lower Badenian aquifer (“detrit”) mixed with recent infiltration...|$|R
40|$|The Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi has a genome {{composed}} of a linear chromosome {{and a series of}} linear and circular plasmids. We previously mapped the oriC of the linear chromosome {{to the center of the}} molecule, where a pronounced switch in CG skew occurs. In this study, we analyzed B. burgdorferi plasmid sequences for AT and CG skew in an effort to similarly identify plasmid replication <b>origins.</b> <b>Cumulative</b> skew diagrams of the plasmids suggested that they, like the linear chromosome, replicate bidirectionally from an internal origin. The B. burgdorferi linear chromosome contains homologs to partitioning protein genes soj and spoOJ, which are closely linked to oriC at the minimum cumulative skew point of the 1 -Mb molecule. A soj/parA homolog also maps to cumulative skew minima of the B. burgdorferi linear and circular plasmids, further suggesting that these regions contain the replication origin. The heterogeneity in these genes and in the nucleotide sequences of the putative origin regions could account for the mutual compatibility of the multiple DNA elements in B. burgdorferi...|$|R
40|$|Consideration of {{the human}} {{epidemiology}} of diseases arising from exposure to naturally occurring and man-made mineral fibers encompasses the several forms of asbestos (chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, anthophyllite, tremolite-actinolite), other naturally occurring silicates (talc, sepiolite, erionite, attapulgite, vermiculite, and wollastonite), and man-made mineral fibers (glass continuous filament, glass/rock/ slag insulation wools, ceramic and other refractory fibers, and glass microfibers). The diseases arising from exposures {{to some of these}} fibers include pleural thickening (plaques, diffuse pleural thickening, and calcification), pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancers, mesothelioma of the pleura and peritoneum, and other cancers). Risk factors important in assessing these diseases include assessment of latency, duration of exposure, <b>cumulative</b> exposure, fiber <b>origin</b> and characteristics (length and diameter), other possible confounding occupational or environmental exposures, and smoking. Methodological issues commonly presenting problems in evaluation of these data include assessment of the adequacy of environmental exposures, particularly in regard to fiber identification, distribution, and concentration over the duration of exposure, and the adequacy of study design to detect health effects (disease frequency, latency, and cohort size). Research priorities include further assessment and standardization of pleural thickening relative to fiber exposure, uniform mesothelioma surveillance, further epidemiological assessment of certain silicate and man-made mineral fiber cohorts with emphasis given to assessment of tremolite and small diameter glass and ceramic fibers. Further assessment of possible health risks of the general public should await improved definition of relevant fiber exposure in ambient air...|$|R
40|$|Carbon (C) and {{nitrogen}} (N) cycling under future {{climate change is}} associated with large uncertainties in litter decomposition and the turnover of soil C and N. In addition, future conditions (especially altered precipitation regimes and warming) are expected to result in changes in vegetation composition, and accordingly in litter species and chemical composition, but {{it is unclear how}} such changes could potentially alter litter decomposition. Litter transplantation experiments were carried out across six European sites (four forests and two grasslands) spanning a large geographical and climatic gradient (5. 6 – 11. 4 °C in annual temperature 511 – 878 mm in precipitation) to gain insight into the climatic controls on litter decomposition as well as the effect of litter origin and species. The decomposition k rates were overall higher in warmer and wetter sites than in colder and drier sites, and positively correlated with the litter total specific leaf area. Also, litter N content increased as less litter mass remained and decay went further. Surprisingly, this study demonstrates that climatic controls on litter decomposition are quantitatively more important than species or site of <b>origin.</b> <b>Cumulative</b> climatic variables, precipitation, soil water content and air temperature (ignoring days with air temperatures below zero degrees Celsius), were appropriate to predict the litter remaining mass during decomposition (M r). M r and cumulative air temperature were found to be the best predictors for litter carbon {{and nitrogen}} remaining during the decomposition. Using mean annual air temperature, precipitation, soil water content and litter total specific leaf area as parameters we were able to predict the annual decomposition rate (k) accurately...|$|R
