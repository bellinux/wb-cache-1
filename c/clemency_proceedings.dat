25|$|Instances of person-eating were {{significantly}} {{lower than that of}} corpse-eating; of the 300 people arrested in April 1942 for cannibalism, only 44 were murderers. 64% of cannibals were female, 44% were unemployed, 90% were illiterate, 15% were rooted inhabitants, and only 2% had any criminal records. More cases occurred in the outlying districts than the city itself. Cannibals were often unsupported women with dependent children and no previous convictions, which allowed for a certain level of <b>clemency</b> in legal <b>proceedings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Harbison v. Bell, , was a {{decision}} by the Supreme Court of the United States that held that federal law gave indigent death row inmates the right to federally appointed counsel to represent them in post-conviction state <b>clemency</b> <b>proceedings,</b> when the state has declined to do so. Certiorari was granted by the Supreme Court on June 23, 2008.|$|E

5000|$|Thierack {{not only}} made penal {{prosecution}} of all unpopular persons and groups harsher. [...] "Antisocial" [...] convicts on the whole were much more often {{turned over to the}} SS. This usually meant Jews, Poles, Russians, and Gypsies. Soon afterwards, though, he utterly forwent any pretense of legality and simply began handing these people over to the SS. Thierack came to an understanding with Heinrich Himmler that certain categories of prisoners were to be, to use their words, [...] "annihilated through work". Ever since coming to office as Reich Minister of Justice in August 1942, Thierack had seen to it that the lengthy paperwork involved in <b>clemency</b> <b>proceedings</b> for those sentenced to death was greatly shortened.|$|E
40|$|Clemency, {{the power}} to reduce the {{sentence}} of a convicted criminal, has existed since ancient times. Yet, {{the use of this}} power in the United States has significantly declined in recent decades. The U. S. Supreme Court has called executive clemency “the fail safe” of the criminal justice system, and has determined that some minimal procedural safeguards apply in <b>clemency</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Lower courts, however, have failed to require any significant procedural safeguards in the clemency process. Because clemency plays a crucial function in the criminal justice system, this Note argues that states should enact both procedural requirements and substantive guidelines to ensure death row inmates receive due process...|$|E
40|$|Full text of {{this item}} is not {{currently}} {{available on the}} LRA. The final published version may be available through the links above. Beginning with Pratt and Morgan v. The Attorney General of Jamaica (1993), the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has issued a series of judgments in death penalty appeals that have significantly restricted the number of executions in the Commonwealth Caribbean and proved politically controversial in the region. This article examines the historical context for two issues that have been central to the Judicial Committee’s decisions: delays in the enforcement of capital sentences {{and the relationship between}} executive clemency and the courts. It does so through analysis of death penalty appeals and <b>clemency</b> <b>proceedings</b> in mid-twentieth century murder cases when reforms to the Jamaica Supreme Court allowed convicted criminals the right of appeal for the first time. These cases show that the practice of sparing convicts from the gallows due to delayed executions has deep local roots in Jamaica that stem not only from the decisions of British law lords and politicians in London and colonial administrators and judges in Kingston, but also Jamaican lawyers, prisoners and politicians who agitated in support of the right of criminal appeal and subsequently used that right to fight capital sentences in the courts. Moreover, they reveal that the clemency process in Jamaican death penalty cases was reformulated following the introduction of criminal appeals in ways that blurred traditional distinctions between mercy and law...|$|E
