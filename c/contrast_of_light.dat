25|$|While Gude was a student, two {{different}} trends in landscaping were developing at the Academy: a romantic trend and a classical trend. The romanticists depicted wild, untamed wildernesses with dark forests, soaring peaks, and rushing water {{to capture the}} terrifying and overpowering aspects of nature. They used rich, saturated colors with strong <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and shadow. The classicists {{were more interested in}} recreating landscapes from the heroic or mythical past and often set them in the midst of religious or historical events. The classicists focused on lines and clarity in their compositions. It was through Achenbach — Gude's first teacher upon arriving in Düsseldorf — that he was exposed to the romanticist tradition, while it was through his classes with and later time teaching for Schirmer that he was exposed to the classicist traditions.|$|E
500|$|The {{first rule}} of {{heraldry}} is the rule of tincture: [...] "Colour must not appear upon colour, nor metal upon metal." [...] The heraldic metals are gold and silver, usually represented as yellow and white, while red, green, blue, purple and black normally comprise the colors. Heraldic bearings are intended for recognition at a distance (in battle), and a <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> metal against dark color is desirable. The same principle {{can be seen in}} the choice of colors for most license plates.|$|E

5000|$|Tenebrism, {{from the}} Italian, tenebroso (murky), also called {{dramatic}} illumination, is {{a style of}} painting using very pronounced chiaroscuro, where there are violent <b>contrasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and dark, and where darkness becomes a dominating feature of the image. The technique was developed to add drama to an image through a spotlight effect, and was popular during the Baroque period of painting. Tenebrism is used only to obtain a dramatic impact while chiaroscuro is a broader term, also covering the use <b>of</b> less extreme <b>contrasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> to enhance the illusion of three-dimensionality.|$|R
500|$|Post-production {{was handled}} by Montreal's Meteor Studios and Hybride Technologies {{filled in the}} bluescreen footage with more than 1,500 visual effects shots. Visual effects {{supervisor}} Chris Watts and production designer Jim Bissell created a process dubbed [...] "The Crush," [...] which allowed the Meteor artists to manipulate the colors by increasing the <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and dark. Certain sequences were desaturated and tinted to establish different moods. Ghislain St-Pierre, who led the team of artists, described the effect: [...] "Everything looks realistic, {{but it has a}} kind of a gritty illustrative feel." [...] Various computer programs, including Maya, RenderMan and RealFlow, were used to create the [...] "spraying blood." [...] The post-production lasted for a year and was handled by a total of ten special effects companies.|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{have long}} noted Shakespeare's {{widespread}} use {{of light and dark}} imagery throughout the play. Caroline Spurgeon considers the theme of light as [...] "symbolic of the natural beauty of young love" [...] and later critics have expanded on this interpretation. For example, both Romeo and Juliet see the other as light in a surrounding darkness. Romeo describes Juliet as being like the sun, brighter than a torch, a jewel sparkling in the night, and a bright angel among dark clouds. Even when she lies apparently dead in the tomb, he says her [...] "beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light." [...] Juliet describes Romeo as [...] "day in night" [...] and [...] "Whiter than snow upon a raven's back." [...] This <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and dark can be expanded as symbols—contrasting love and hate, youth and age in a metaphoric way. Sometimes these intertwining metaphors create dramatic irony. For example, Romeo and Juliet's love is a light {{in the midst of the}} darkness of the hate around them, but all of their activity together is done in night and darkness while all of the feuding is done in broad daylight. This paradox of imagery adds atmosphere to the moral dilemma facing the two lovers: loyalty to family or loyalty to love. At the end of the story, when the morning is gloomy and the sun hiding its face for sorrow, light and dark have returned to their proper places, the outward darkness reflecting the true, inner darkness of the family feud out of sorrow for the lovers. All characters now recognise their folly in light of recent events, and things return to the natural order, thanks to the love and death of Romeo and Juliet. The [...] "light" [...] theme in the play is also heavily connected to the theme of time since light was a convenient way for Shakespeare to express the passage of time through descriptions of the sun, moon, and stars.|$|E

There under the vivid summer sun, beside the glittering sea, men and women met to commune on the incommunicable, to question the voiceless, and to embrace the intangible. It was, indeed, such a revelation of human credulity as might well have overpowered a young novelist. From the warm, pine-scented afternoon air I crept {{into one of these}} tiny cabins, and sat with my hands upon a closed slate in order to receive a message from Lincoln or Cæsar; I slipped beneath the shelter of a tent to have a sealed letter read by a commonplace person with an Indian accent; and I sat at night in dark little parlors to watch weak men and weeping women embrace very badly designed effigies of their lost darlings." ...|$|E

"We slept {{near the}} top, at the Village of Simplon, {{in a very}} fair and well-warmed inn, close to a {{mountain}} stream, {{which is one of}} the great ornaments of this side of the road. We have here passed into a region of granite, from that of limestone, and what is called gneiss. The valleys are sharper and closer,--like cracks in a hard and solid mass;--and there is much more of the startling <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and shade, as well as more angular boldness of outline; to all which the more abundant waters add a fresh and vivacious interest. Looking back through one of these abysmal gorges, one sees two torrents dashing together, the precipice and ridge on one side, pitch-black with shade; and that on the other all flaming gold; while behind rises, in a huge cone, one of the glacier summits of the chain. The stream at one's feet rushes at a leap some two hundred feet down, and is bordered with pines and beeches, struggling through a ruined world of clefts and boulders. I never saw anything so much resembling some of the Circles described by Dante. From Simplon we made for Duomo d'Ossola; having broken out, as through the mouth of a mine, into green and fertile valleys full of vines and chestnuts, and white villages,--in short, into sunshine and Italy.|$|E

6000|$|... 159. A {{certain number}} of you, by faculty and natural disposition,--and all, so far as you are {{interested}} in modern art,--will necessarily have to put yourselves under the discipline of the Greek or chiaroscuro school, which is directed primarily to the attainment of the power of representing form by pure <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and shade. I say, the [...] "discipline" [...] of the Greek school, both because, followed faithfully, it is indeed a severe one, and because to follow it at all is, for persons fond of colour, often a course of painful self-denial, from which young students are eager to escape. And yet, when the laws of both schools are rightly obeyed, the most perfect discipline is that of the colourists; for they see and draw everything, while the chiaroscurists must leave much indeterminate in mystery, or invisible in gloom: and there are therefore many licentious and vulgar forms of art connected with the chiaroscuro school, both in painting and etching, which have no parallel among the colourists. But both schools, rightly followed, require first of all absolute accuracy of delineation. This you need not hope to escape. Whether you fill your spaces with colours, or with shadows, they must equally be of the true outline and in true gradations. I have been thirty years telling modern students of art this in vain. I mean to say it to you only once, for the statement is too important to be weakened by repetition.|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} chapter of this section I noticed the {{distinction}} between real aerial perspective, and that overcharged <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and shade by which the old masters obtained their deceptive effect; and I showed that, though inferior to them in the precise quality or tone of aerial color, our great modern master is altogether more truthful in the expression of the proportionate relation of all his distances to one another. I am now about to examine those modes of expressing space, both in nature and art by far the most important, which are dependent, not on the relative hues of objects, but on the drawing of them: by far the most important, I say, because the most constant and certain; for nature herself is not always aerial. Local effects are frequent which interrupt and violate the laws of aerial tone, and induce strange deception in our ideas of distance. I have often seen the summit of a snowy mountain look nearer than its base, owing to the perfect clearness of the upper air. But the drawing of objects, that is to say, the degree in which their details and parts are distinct or confused, is an unfailing and certain criterion of their distance; and if this be rightly rendered in a painting, we shall have genuine truth of space, in spite of many errors in aerial tone; while, if this be neglected, all space will be destroyed, whatever dexterity of tint may be employed to conceal the defective drawing.|$|E
6000|$|I saw Ambrosio's countenance kindle at Onuphrio's {{explanation}} of his opinions, and {{he appeared to}} be meditating an angry reply. I endeavoured to change the conversation to the state of the Colosaeum, with which it had begun. [...] "These ruins," [...] I said, [...] "as you have both observed, are highly impressive; yet when I saw them six years ago they had a stronger effect on my imagination; whether it was the charm of novelty, or that my mind was fresher, or that the circumstances under which I saw them were peculiar, I know not, but probably all these causes operated in affecting my mind. It was a still and beautiful evening in the end of May; the last sunbeams were dying away in the western sky and the first moonbeams shining in the eastern; the bright orange tints lighted up the ruins and as it were kindled the snows that still remained on the distant Apennines, which were visible from the highest accessible part of the amphitheatre. In this glow of colouring, the green of advanced spring softened the grey and yellow tints of the decaying stones, and as the lights gradually became fainter, the masses appeared grander and more gigantic; and when the twilight had entirely disappeared, the <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and shade in the beams of the full moon and beneath a sky of the brightest sapphire, but so highly illuminated that only Jupiter and a few stars of the first magnitude were visible, gave a solemnity and magnificence to the scene which awakened the highest degree of that emotion which is so properly termed the sublime. The beauty and the permanency of the heavens and the principle of conservation belonging to the system of the universe, the works of the Eternal and Divine Architect, were finely opposed to the perishing and degraded works of man in his most active and powerful state. And at this moment so humble appeared to me the condition of the most exalted beings belonging to the earth, so feeble their combinations, so minute the point of space, and so limited the period of time in which they act, that I could hardly avoid comparing the generations of man, and the effects of his genius and power, to the swarms of luceoli or fire-flies which were dancing around me and that appeared flitting and sparkling amidst the gloom and darkness of the ruins, but which were no longer visible when they rose above the horizon, their feeble light being lost and utterly obscured in the brightness of the moonbeams in the heavens." ...|$|E

6000|$|... § 12. Now it {{is evident}} that in Rembrandt's system, while the {{contrasts}} are not more right than with Veronese, the colors are all wrong, from beginning to end. With Turner and Veronese, Nature's 10 is their 10, and Nature's 20 their 20; enabling them to give pure truth up to a certain point. But with Rembrandt not one color is absolutely true, {{from one side of the}} scale to the other; only the contrasts are true at the top of the scale. Of course, this supposes Rembrandt's system applied to a subject which shall try it to the utmost, such as landscape. Rembrandt generally chose subjects in which the real colors were very nearly imitable,--as single heads with dark backgrounds, in which Nature's highest light was little above his own; her 40 being then truly representable by his 40, his picture became nearly an absolute truth. But his system is only right when applied to such subjects: clearly, when we have the full scale of natural light to deal with, Turner's and Veronese's convey the greatest sum of truth. But not the most complete deception, for people are so much more easily and instinctively impressed by force of light than truth of color, that they instantly miss the relative power of the sky, and the upper tones; and all the true local coloring looks strange to them, separated from its adjuncts of high light; whereas, give them the true <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> and they will not observe the false local color. Thus all Gaspar Poussin's and Salvator's pictures, and all effects obtained by leaving high lights in the midst of exaggerated darkness, catch the eye, and are received for true, while the pure truth of Veronese and Turner is rejected as unnatural; only not so much in Veronese's case as in Turner's, because Veronese confines himself to more imitable things, as draperies, figures, and architecture, in which his exquisite truth at the bottom of the scale tells on the eye at once; but Turner works a good deal also (see the table) at the top of the natural scale, dealing with effects of sunlight and other phases of the upper colors, more or less inimitable, and betraying therefore, more or less, the artifices used to express them. It will be observed, also, that in order to reserve some force for the top of his scale, Turner is obliged to miss his gradations chiefly in middle tints (see the table), where the feebleness is sure to be felt. His principal point for missing the midmost gradations is almost always between the earth and sky; he draws the earth truly as far as he can, to the horizon; then the sky as far as he can, with his 30 to 40 part of the scale. They run together at the horizon; and the spectator complains that there is no distinction between earth and sky, or that the earth does not look solid enough.|$|E

30|$|Michelangelo Merisi {{was born}} in September 1571 in Caravaggio, near Milan and was always known {{by the name of}} his hometown. Caravaggio moved to Rome in the early 1590 s.

Several works were realized as religious works commissioned by important exponents of clergy (BBC, 2017).|$|R
50|$|His {{emphasis}} on even light and geometry is brought out by comparing his works {{with those of}} the rather younger Emanuel de Witte, who included people, <b>contrasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and such clutter of church furniture as remained in Calvinist churches, all usually ignored by Saenredam. Unlike de Witte's, Saenredam's views are usually roughly aligned with a main axis of the church.|$|R

50|$|This {{is one of}} the painter's last works, and one of {{the most}} bitter. The <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and shade gave him pleasure.
