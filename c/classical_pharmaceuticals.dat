40|$|International audienceAccurate wound {{assessment}} {{is a critical}} task for patient care and health cost reduction at hospital but even still worse {{in the context of}} clinical studies in laboratory. This task, completely devoted to nurses, still relies on manual and tedious practices. Wound shape is measured with rules, tracing papers or rarely with alginate castings and serum injection. The wound tissues proportion is also estimated by a qualitative visual assessment based on the red-yellow-black code. Further to our preceding works on wound 3 D complete assessment using a simple freehanded digital camera, we explore here the adaptation of this tool to wounds artificially created for experimentation purposes. It results that tissue uniformity and flatness leads to a simplified approach but requires multispectral imaging for enhanced wound delineation. We demonstrate that, in this context, a simple active contour method can successfully replace more complex tools such as SVM supervised classification, as no training step is required and that one shot is enough to deal with perspective projection errors. Moreover, involving all the spectral response of the tissue and not only RGB components provides a higher discrimination for separating healed epithelial tissue from granulation tissue. This research work is part of a comparative preclinical study on healing wounds. It aims to compare the efficiency of specific medical honeys with <b>classical</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> for wound care. Results revealed that medical honey competes with more expensive pharmaceuticals...|$|E

Within the embryonic stem cell-based novel alternative tests project, we developed a test battery framework that allows inclusion of any developmental toxicity assay and that explores the responses of such test systems {{to a wide range of}} drug-like compounds. We selected 28 compounds, including several biologics (e. g., erythropoietin), <b>classical</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> (e. g., roflumilast) and also six environmental toxicants. The chemical, toxicological and clinical data of this screen library were compiled. In order to determine a non-cytotoxic concentration range, cytotoxicity data were obtained for all compounds from HEK 293 cells and from murine embryonic stem cells. Moreover, an estimate of relevant exposures was provided by literature data mining. To evaluate feasibility of the suggested test framework, we selected a well-characterized assay that evaluates 'migration inhibition of neural crest cells. ' Screening at the highest non-cytotoxic concentration resulted in 11 hits (e. g., geldanamycin, abiraterone, gefitinib, chlorpromazine, cyproconazole, arsenite). These were confirmed in concentration-response studies. Subsequent pharmacokinetic modeling indicated that triadimefon exerted its effects at concentrations relevant to the in vivo situation, and also interferon-β and polybrominated diphenyl ether showed effects within the same order of magnitude of concentrations that may be reached in humans. In conclusion, the test battery framework can identify compounds that disturb processes relevant for human development and therefore may represent developmental toxicants. The open structure of the strategy allows rich information to be generated on both the underlying library, and on any contributing assay. © 2014 The Author(s).

50|$|Freeze drying or {{lyophilization}} is a drying method {{where the}} solvent is frozen prior to drying and is then sublimed, i.e., {{passed to the}} gas phase directly from the solid phase, below the melting point of the solvent. It is increasingly applied to dry foods, beyond its already <b>classical</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> or medical applications. It keeps biological properties of proteins, and retains vitamins and bioactive compounds. Pressure can be reduced by a high vacuum pump (though freeze drying at atmospheric pressure is possible in dry air). If using a vacuum pump, the vapor produced by sublimation {{is removed from the}} system by converting it into ice in a condenser, operating at very low temperatures, outside the freeze drying chamber.|$|R
40|$|According the tested {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of}} constituents and their chemical characteristics, a new formulation of oral antiseptic was made based on garlic bulb powder and its active principles with strong antimicrobial activity against {{wide range of}} bacteria and fungi. The antimicrobial activity of garlic bulb powder, allicin and the lozenge with 15 % of garlic powder was tested using broth microdilution method. The tested garlic powder, as well lozenge has shown very high antimicrobial activity with MIC 1. 25 - 5. 00 mg/ml, and 1. 87 - 7. 50 mg/ml, respectively. The major compound allicin was highly active in very low concentration. Minimal inhibitory concentration of allicin was from 6. 25 - 12. 50 μg/ml for antibacterial activity and 0. 4 μg/ml for antifungal activity. Those concentrations are comparable with concentration of commercially available antibiotics and fungicides. The formulation of an antiseptic with herbal constituents, high antibacterial and antifungal activity and pleasant taste could be an alternative to <b>classical</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> oral antiseptics...|$|R
40|$|A {{large body}} of {{evidence}} has demonstrated that LDL-C reduction by statins decrease cardiovascular risk. Statin treatment may also lead to non-lipid effects which may improve vascular protection, including an amelioration of endothelial function. On the other hand, despite a good tolerability demonstrated by several studies, statin treatment may lead to side effects, in particular when higher dosages are used. Alternative hypolipidemic treatments are nutraceuticals which are a food, or part of a food, that provides medical bene ts. Due to the low ef cacy associated to a high tolerability, patients with mild or moderate risk and/or statin-intolerant subjects are the best target of nutraceuticals. Despite a large clinical use, there is a paucity of controlled clinical studies of ef cacy and tolerability of this class of drugs. The {{purpose of the present}} study, with a double-blind, parallel group, randomized controlled design was to examine the ef cacy, safety, and tolerability of a nutraceutical product in hypercholesterolemic patients with a mild/ moderate risk previously intolerant to statins or refusing <b>classical</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> treatments. We also analyzed the pulse wave velocity as expression of arterial stiffness and, indirectly, of endothelial function. Patients received daily either a nutraceutical-combined pill (NCP), containing red yeast rice 200 mg (corresponding to monakoline 3 mg) or placebo for six weeks. We observed a reduction of 10, 4...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMagnesium {{gluconate}} is a <b>classical</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> compound used as {{a source}} of magnesium for the prevention and treatment of hypomagnesemia. To the best of our knowledge, a robust and reliable liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry technique has not yet been reported for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of magnesium gluconate. This study describes the method development for the LC–ESI–MS/MS analysis of magnesium gluconate using three different reversed-phase HPLC conditions (Method I–III) with comprehensive fragmentation pattern and the structural characterization by NMR spectroscopy. The LC–MS and NMR data were found in accordance with the structure of magnesium gluconate. When magnesium gluconate was dissolved in the acetonitrile and water–methanol solutions, it exists in situ in three different forms: magnesium gluconate itself, gluconic acid, and magnesium gluconate chelate with gluconic acid by a coordinate covalent bond. Method I exhibited pseudo-molecular ion peaks with more magnesium gluconate chelates with gluconic acid, while method II showed an adduct of magnesium gluconate with the solvent along with the molecular ion peak. There was no pseudo-molecular ion peaks found in method III. Thus, method III was found to be the more accurate, robust and reliable LC–MS method for the qualitative and quantitative analysis, structural characterization, and could also be suitable for the pharmacokinetic study of magnesium gluconate. The detailed fragmentation analysis might be useful for the structural characterization of unknown divalent organometallics...|$|R
40|$|Future {{technologies}} {{aiming at}} restoring and enhancing organs function will intimately rely on near-physiological and energy-efficient communication between living and artificial biomimetic systems. Interfacing brain-inspired devices {{with the real}} brain {{is at the forefront}} of such emerging field, with the term ‘neurobiohybrids’ indicating all those systems where such interaction is established. We argue that achieving a ‘high-level’ communication and functional synergy between natural and artificial neuronal networks in vivo, will allow the development of a heterogeneous world of neurobiohybrids, which will include ‘living robots’ but will also embrace ‘intelligent’ neuroprostheses for augmentation of brain function. The societal and economical impact of intelligent neuroprostheses is likely to be potentially strong, as they will offer novel therapeutic perspectives for a number of diseases, and going beyond <b>classical</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> schemes. However, they will unavoidably raise fundamental ethical questions on the intermingling between man and machine and, more specifically, on how deeply it should be allowed that brain processing is affected by implanted ‘intelligent’ artificial systems. Following this perspective, we provide the reader with insights on ongoing developments and trends in the field of neurobiohybrids. We address the topic also from a ‘community building’ perspective, showing through a quantitative bibliographic analysis, how scientists working on the engineering of brain-inspired devices and brain-machine interfaces are increasing their interactions. We foresee that such trend preludes to a formidable technological and scientific revolution in brain-machine communication and to the opening of new avenues for restoring or even augmenting brain function for therapeutic purposes...|$|R
40|$|Magnesium {{gluconate}} is a <b>classical</b> organometallic <b>pharmaceutical</b> compound {{used for}} the prevention and treatment of hypomagnesemia {{as a source of}} magnesium ion. The present research described the in-depth study on solid state properties viz. physicochemical and thermal properties of magnesium gluconate using sophisticated analytical techniques like PXRD, PSA, FT-IR, UV–Vis spectroscopy, TGA/DTG, and DSC. Magnesium gluconate was found to be crystalline in nature along with the crystallite size ranging from 14. 10 to 47. 35  nm. The particle size distribution was at d(0. 1) = 6. 552  µm, d(0. 5) = 38. 299  µm, d(0. 9) = 173. 712  µm and D(4, 3) = 67. 122  µm along with the specific surface area of 0. 372  m 2 /g. The wavelength for the maximum absorbance was at 198. 0  nm. Magnesium gluconate exhibited 88. 51 % weight loss with three stages of thermal degradation process up to 895. 18  °C from room temperature. The TGA/DTG thermograms of the analyte indicated that magnesium gluconate was thermally stable up to around 165  °C. Consequently, the melting temperature of magnesium gluconate was found to be 169. 90  °C along with the enthalpy of fusion of 308. 7  J/g. Thus, the authors conclude that the achieved results from this study are very useful in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries for the identification, characterization and qualitative analysis of magnesium gluconate for preformulation studies and also for developing magnesium gluconate based novel formulation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract During {{the years}} 2003 – 2005, a {{comparative}} ethnobotanical field {{survey was conducted}} on remedies used in traditional animal healthcare in eight Mediterranean areas. The study sites were selected within the EU-funded RUBIA project, and were as follows: the upper Kelmend Province of Albania; the Capannori area in Eastern Tuscany and the Bagnocavallo area of Romagna, Italy; Cercle de Ouezanne, Morocco; Sierra de Aracena y Picos de Aroche Natural Park {{in the province of}} Huelva, Spain; the St. Catherine area of the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt; Eastern and Western Crete, Greece; the Paphos and Larnaca areas of Cyprus; and the Mitidja area of Algeria. One hundred and thirty-six veterinary preparations and 110 plant taxa were recorded in the survey, with Asteraceae and Lamiaceae being the most quoted botanical families. For certain plant species the survey uncovered veterinary phytotherapeutical indications that were very uncommon, and to our knowledge never recorded before. These include Anabasis articulata (Chenopodiaceae), Cardopatium corymbosum (Asteraceae), Lilium martagon (Liliaceae), Dorycnium rectum (Fabaceae), Oenanthe pimpinelloides (Apiaceae), Origanum floribundum (Lamiaceae), Tuberaria lignosa (Cistaceae), and Dittrichia graveolens (Asteraceae). These phytotherapeutical indications are briefly discussed in this report, taking into account modern phytopharmacology and phytochemistry. The percentage of overall botanical veterinary taxa recorded in all the study areas was extremely low (8 %), however when all taxa belonging to the same botanical genus are considered, this portion increases to 17 %. Nevertheless, very few plant uses were found {{to be part of a}} presumed "Mediterranean" cultural heritage in veterinary practices, which raises critical questions about the concept of Mediterraneanism in ethnobotany and suggests that further discussion is required. Nearly the half of the recorded veterinary plant uses for mammals uncovered in this survey have also been recorded in the same areas in human folk medicine, suggesting a strong link between human and veterinary medical practices, and perhaps also suggesting the adaptive origins of a few medical practices. Since most of the recorded data concern remedies for treating cattle, sheep, goats, and camels, it would be interesting to test a few of the recorded phytotherapeuticals in the future, to see if they are indeed able to improve animal healthcare in breeding environments, or to raise the quality of dairy and meat products in the absence of <b>classical,</b> industrial, veterinary <b>pharmaceuticals.</b> </p...|$|R
