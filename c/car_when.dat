5|$|After first {{arriving}} at Fort Crockett, Middleton adapted to garrison life while {{engaging in the}} Galveston social scene by attending Saturday night dances in town. At one such dance he had a navy lieutenant introduce him to Jerusha Collins, who would later become his wife. She had attended Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas and had made her debut in Galveston society in 1911. Following {{the death of her}} father, Sidney G. Collins, Jerusha had come to live with her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. John Hagemann, in the heart of Galveston. As a merchant, Hagemann was well to do, and drove a Studebaker touring <b>car</b> <b>when</b> most people in the town rode in buggies, wagons, and surreys. Middleton met the Hagemanns, soon becoming a regular visitor at their house while calling on Jerusha.|$|E
5|$|Alfa Romeo {{dominated}} {{the rest of}} the Grand Prix season. Nuvolari and Campari drove the newly introduced Alfa Romeo P3 at the Italian Grand Prix, while Borzacchini and Caracciola drove much heavier 8Cs. Caracciola was forced to retired when his car broke down, but he took over Borzacchini's <b>car</b> <b>when</b> the Italian was hit by a stone, and came third, behind Nuvolari and Fagioli. In the French Grand Prix, Caracciola, now driving a P3, battled Nuvolari for the lead early on. Alfa Romeo's dominance was so great and their cars so far ahead the team could choose the top three finishing positions, thus Nuvolari won from Borzacchini and Caracciola, with the two Italians ahead of the German. The order was different at the 1932 German Grand Prix, where Caracciola won from Nuvolari and Borzacchini.|$|E

5|$|Caracciola {{regained his}} German Grand Prix title at the Nürburgring at the 1928 German Grand Prix, driving the new 7.1-litre Mercedes-Benz SS. He shared the driving with Christian Werner, {{who took over}} Caracciola's <b>car</b> <b>when</b> the latter {{collapsed}} with heat exhaustion at a pit stop. The German Grand Prix, like many other races at the time, ignored the official Grand Prix racing rules set by the Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus (International Association of Recognized Auto Clubs, or AIACR), which limited weight and fuel consumption, and instead ran races under a Formula Libre, or free formula. As a result, Mercedes-Benz focused less on producing Grand Prix cars and more on sports cars, and Caracciola drove the latest incarnation of this line, the SSK, at the Semmering hillclimb, and further reduced his own record on the course by half a second.|$|E

5|$|Barrichello and Michael Schumacher {{started to}} {{maintain}} the gap between themselves and Montoya, and started {{to pull away from}} Ralf Schumacher. Bernoldi passed Villeneuve for tenth position on lap two, while Irvine dropped to ninth one lap later after he was overtaken by Verstappen and Räikkönen. He later fell behind Alesi, Bernoldi and Villeneuve on the fourth lap. Button's engine failed which caused him to retire on lap five. Irvine lost a further three positions to Häkkinen, Panis and Frentzen one lap later. Coulthard became the third retirement of the Grand Prix after an engine failure on lap seven, which meant Verstappen inherited fifth and Räikkönen moved into sixth. Montoya had a blister on one of his rear tyres which caused him to slide under braking, and was slow exiting the Variante della Roggia chicane which allowed Barrichello to take the lead on the ninth lap. Three laps later, Alesi passed Räikkönen for sixth while Häkkinen moved into tenth after passing Bernoldi on lap 13. Irvine retired on lap 14 because he lost horsepower in his <b>car</b> <b>when</b> a cylinder in his engine stopped working.
