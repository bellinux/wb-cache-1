The ship {{contained}} 116 passengers, 1579 bales <b>of</b> wool, 2729 <b>carcases</b> <b>of</b> mutton, 4650 <b>carcases</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamb,</b> 2000 quarters <b>of</b> beef, 4800 crates of frozen rabbits and 200 tones of lead and copper.

40|$|Multiple {{studies were}} {{conducted}} at 3 abattoirs {{to determine the}} potential of a dual function GR/Impedance probe to measure GR soft- tissue depth (depth at the 12 th rib, 110 mm from the mid line <b>of</b> the <b>carcase)</b> <b>of</b> typical <b>lamb</b> <b>carcases</b> processed in Australia. Lamb carcases (1016) were measured approximately 25 min post slaughter with the probe and a GR knife as {{the most commonly used}} measurement. Modelling indicated that variation in the measurement using the probe compared to the measurement using the knife occurred with increasing carcase weight and fatness as well as between different abattoirs. Consequently, the probe in its current design cannot provide the repeatable measurement required by industr...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of dietary protein supplementation on resistance to haemonchosis was examined in Hampshire down lambs fed either a basal diet or a diet supplemented with soyabean. At seven months <b>of</b> age the <b>lambs</b> were challenged {{with an initial}} loading dose of Haemonchus contortus, followed by a trickle infection {{three times a week}}. Blood and faecal samples were collected three times a week and bodyweights were recorded weekly. After 10 weeks the lambs were slaughtered and their worm burdens and carcase composition determined. Although their mean worm burdens were similar, the lambs given the basal diet had higher faecal egg counts, lower packed red eel volumes and lower concentrations of total plasma protein and plasma albumin than the lambs given the supplemented diet. The dietary supplementation also improved the <b>carcase</b> composition <b>of</b> the <b>lambs...</b>|$|R
40|$|In vivo {{measures}} <b>of</b> <b>carcase</b> quality can aid selection. Muscle density, (measured {{by computer}} tomography) has strong negative genetic and phenotypic correlations with intramuscular fat. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate growth and <b>carcase</b> parameters <b>of</b> <b>lambs,</b> sired by five high and low muscle density Terminal sire rams, using three different covariates. Progeny (n= 394) were recorded for live weight at: birth; 8 weeks, 16 weeks and immediately pre-slaughter. Ultrasonic measurements were made at the third lumbar vertebrae, pre-slaughter. Carcase records include carcase weights, EUROP classification scores for fatness and conformation. Data were analysed using GENSTAT 15, using a sire nested within muscle density ANOVA design model, fitting sex; dam age (slaughter batch for carcase traits); birth/rear type and MyoMaxTM carrier status. The model was adjusted for the covariates, age at measurement (age) : live weight at slaughter (Slwt); or slaughter fat grade (fat). Low muscle density sired lambs were heavier at 8 weeks (age P= 0. 022; Slwt P= 0. 043 : fat P= 0. 04) and 16 weeks (age 0. 014; Slwt P= 0. 05; fat P= 0. 036). However high muscle density sired lambs had increased ultrasonic muscle depth (age 0. 0 19 : Slwt P= 0. 017; and fat P= 0. 017), heavier hot carcase weight (age P= 0. 004; Slwt P< 0. 001; fat P= 0. 004), 48 h cold carcase weight (age P= 0. 027; Slwt P< 0. 001 : fat P= 0. 013), higher killing out percentages (age, Slwt and fat P< 0. 001), and improved carcase conformation (age, Slwt and fat P< 0. 001). It is proposed that when compared at the same end point, high muscle density sired lambs have increased lean tissue which is expressed as higher carcase weight rather than live weight. Further data analysis is underway to investigate primal yields, waste data and eating quality...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the <b>carcase</b> composition <b>of</b> Taiwan simulated native chickens {{at different stages of}} growth. The results indicated that the <b>carcases</b> <b>of</b> male chickens exhibited significantly larger protein mass and water mass than those of females during weeks 7 to 20; as was the ash mass during weeks 8 to 20. However, the fat mass <b>of</b> the <b>carcases</b> <b>of</b> female chickens was larger than that of males during weeks 14 to 20. Separate regression equations were derived for the relationship between protein mass, fat mass, ash mass and water mass and both carcase weight and age of both male and female chickens...|$|R

50|$|The EUROP {{grid method}} of carcass {{classification}} was implemented in 1981. European Economic Community Regulations (EEC) No. 1208/81 and No. 2930/81 were enacted {{to facilitate the}} application of a community scale for the classification <b>of</b> <b>carcases</b> <b>of</b> adult bovine animals. This was to ensure the uniform classification <b>of</b> the <b>carcases</b> <b>of</b> adult bovine animals in the EEC and make the definitions of conformation classes and fat classes more precise. The need arose for a common grading scale when member states of the EEC began operating in the common beef market in 1968 (EEC) No. 805/68 and price reporting to the EC became mandatory.|$|R
