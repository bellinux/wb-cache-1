She hurried to Uncle Whittier's store for a package of <b>corn-flakes,</b> she abstractedly listened to Uncle Whittier's denunciation of Martin Mahoney for asserting that the wind last Tuesday had been south and not southwest, she came back along streets that held no surprises nor the startling faces of strangers. Thinking of Hugh's teething all the way, she did not reflect that this store, these drab blocks, made up all her background. She did her work, and she triumphed over winning from the Clarks at five hundred.|$|E
40|$|Irving Fisher (1867 – 1947) was {{not merely}} a {{scientific}} economist. He was a fully engaged public intellectual, seeking to influence public opinion and policymakers not just on economic issues such as his “compensated dol-lar ” plan for monetary policy (varying the dollar price of gold to hold a price index steady) or the definition of taxable income (excluding saving) but also a national Department of Health, compulsory health insurance, diet reform (in collaboration with Dr. Kellogg of Battle Creek, of <b>corn-flakes</b> fame), eugenics, limitation of immigration, prohibition of alcohol, revision of the calendar (so that each month {{would have the same}} number of days), and the League of Nations (which he believed himself to have invented—not entirely without reason), debates in which he drew on his reputation as an authoritative economic expert. In addition to hundreds of articles in the popular press and scholarly journals, Fisher wrote three books opposing repeal of Prohibition and two advocating US entry into the League of Nations, as well as a leaflet endorsing the Equal Rights Amendment (which he may not have entirely understood, since he based his support on respect for motherhood). His greatest best seller, How t...|$|E

Subsequent snowfall can bury layers of surface hoar, incorporating them into the snowpack where they can form a weak layer. Sometimes referred to as hoar frost.|$|R

40|$|Zea {{stands for}} ‘sustaining life’ and Mays stands for ‘life giver’. Zea mays {{is one of}} the oldest and most dynamic crop species, which has gained {{popularity}} in modern world too, due to its applications in diverse dishes. Corn is produced in every continent of the world with the exception of Antarctica. It is an annual monoecious sunny plant, surviving perfectly in nutrient rich, well-drained soil. Each and every part of the corn, from husk to corn silk is beneficial for the society. There are more than 3, 500 different uses for corn products. Corn does much more than feed people and livestock. The plant contains alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, maizenic acid, vitamins B 1, K and minerals like potassium, phosphorous and zinc. Traditionally, Maize is used as an analgesic, anti-diarrheal, anti-prostatitic, anti-lithiasis, anti-tumor, anti-hypertensive, anti-diabetic, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant. In this review article, we have narrated miscellaneous uses of corn varieties and described the pharmacological activities, phytoconstituents, nutritional value and traditional uses of maize. The maize has assorted uses like culinary, medicinal and industrial. Corn dishes like corn-meal, <b>corn-flakes,</b> popcorn, “makki ki roti” and corn soup highlight its dominance all over the world. Therefore, maize has become a craze among modern youth...|$|E
40|$|Acrylamide (CH 2 =CHCONH 2), a {{neurotoxic}} {{and potentially}} carcinogenic substance for human health, {{is in the}} glare of the spotlights for a few years. This is mostly {{due to the fact that}} acrylamide was found worldwide in various heated foodstuffs. Levels reported in the literature vary from 25 to 2000 ìg/kg and potato products are considered as the most contaminated. A possible pathway of synthesis of acrylamide is the Maillard reaction between reducing sugars and the amino acid asparagine. The aim of this study was to develop a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry method to analyse as quickly as possible acrylamide in a variety of Belgian food samples such as potatoes, French fries, crisp bread, coffee, <b>corn-flakes,</b> etc. The sample preparation consisted in a liquid/liquid extraction, a centrifugation, followed by purification with Solid Phase Extraction (SPE). The instruments used were a Waters 2690 Alliance HPLC system coupled to a Micro-mass Quattro Ultima Platinum triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. The analysis was performed in MS/MS mode using isotopic dilution technique for quantification. An internal 13 C 3 labelled standard was added prior to extraction. Quantifica-tion in MS/MS mode was calculated by reconstructing the ion current with the most abundant daughter ions for native and 13 C labelled standard (ions of m/z 55 and 58). Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In 2013 the European Metrology Research Program (EMRP) funded a 36 months {{research}} project, "Multidimensional Reflectometry for Industry, xD-Reflect", {{to investigate}} the macroscopic optical properties related to visual appearance of modern surfaces. During the three years duration of the project, over in August 2016, several visual experiments have been performed to investigate appearance of materials with goniochromatic and sparkling effects. Metal-flakes produce shiny effects whose definitions, quantities and metrological characterizations are still under development. This paper relates to the measurement and visual estimation of graininess and brightness perceived of metal flakes achromatic pigments materials. The subjective ranking on graininess and brightness of three different sample sets different for particles shape (silver dollar and <b>corn-flakes)</b> and dimension, were compared under similar viewing conditions on two commercial lighting booths, one based on LED lighting and one on fluorescent light, both reproducing CIE D 65 illuminating conditions. The subjective rankings were compared with the graininess measured with a Byk-Mac instrument and the luminance measured with a luminancemeter in the experimental conditions inside both lighting booths. The performances of the two lighting cabinets and of the two different flake shapes were also compared. The results are useful both for shops lighting arrangements and industrial panelist investigations...|$|E
