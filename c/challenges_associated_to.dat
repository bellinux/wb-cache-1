50|$|Tonye Princewill {{sponsored}} several baseline {{studies in}} 2013, covering {{the state of}} education, environment, and health in Rivers State. In education, research showed {{that a large number}} of Model Secondary and Primary Schools were not finished and had been abandoned. The management of oil spillages in Rivers State, a catalyst for youth restiveness, was seen as ineffective across local governments in the State. Survey respondents reported that funds which ought to have gone into cleaning and sanitisation of their communities were diverted by local officials. These findings also support press reports about corruption in government allocations to oil producing areas. In the area of health, there is widespread disenchantment about the lack of improvement within the sector. Weak health service delivery in Rivers State is forcing many patients to seek medical attention at unregulated traditional medicine shops. <b>Challenges</b> <b>associated</b> <b>to</b> HIV/AIDS, the lack of qualified health professionals, and unfinished health projects, are serious concerns among respondents. These findings substantiate reports in the press that raise questions about the efficacy of funds injected into the sector by the Rivers State administration.|$|E

These wounds are painful, debilitating and are estimated to affect almost 500, 000 Australians. One major <b>challenge</b> <b>associated</b> <b>to</b> chronic wound management consists in limiting the bacterial load in the wound bed.

30|$|Assuming {{then that}} the risk of cystotomy should be higher in {{patients}} with increasing number of previous CS, we further analyzed major complication rate occurrence in the subgroup of patients with 1, 2, and 3 or more previous CS. We observed that the number of previous scars had no relation to the number or type of complication (Table  6). Under this same assumption, surgical operative time should be longer due to the major surgical <b>challenge</b> <b>associated</b> <b>to</b> numerous scars. Average surgical time was of 140  min in patients with 1 previous CS, 130  min with 2, and 136  min for patients with 3 or more previous CS showing {{that this was not a}} conditioning factor regarding operative time.|$|R

40|$|The main <b>challenge</b> <b>associated</b> <b>to</b> {{regional}} {{water supply}} systems planning lies {{in understanding the}} best infrastructure alternatives to improve service given a certain configuration of the resources system.

Both costs and benefits can be organized into a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) framework. In a complex system, a model reproducing its topology and characteristics better describes the impacts of the alternatives. In this work some alternatives to improve service in the regional water supply system of Apulia, Southern Italy, are illustrated and compared through CBA.
