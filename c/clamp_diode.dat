40|$|Introducing {{resonant}} inductance and <b>clamping</b> <b>diodes</b> {{into the}} full-bridge converter can eliminate the voltage oscillation across the rectifier diodes {{and increase the}} load range for zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) achievement. The resonant inductance is shorted and its current keeps constant when the <b>clamping</b> <b>diode</b> is conducting, and the <b>clamping</b> <b>diode</b> is hard turned-off, causing significant reverse recovery loss if the output filter inductance is relatively larger. This paper improves the full-bridge converter by introducing a reset winding in series with the resonant inductance to make the <b>clamping</b> <b>diode</b> current decay rapidly when it conducts. The reset winding not only reduces the conduction losses, but also makes the <b>clamping</b> <b>diodes</b> naturally turn-off and avoids the reverse recovery. As the diodes are turned off naturally and reverse recovery voltage is avoided the distortions caused in the output voltage is removed to a maximum extend by varying the turns ratio of the transformer. The energy stored in the reset winding is also increased by which the inductor value of the snubber circuit {{to turn off the}} <b>clamping</b> <b>diodes</b> also increases, which results in reductions in the distortions of the output voltage...|$|R
