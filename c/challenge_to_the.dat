In 2009–2010, the theater introduced a pair of discounted ticket programs: a five dollar lunchtime series of 45-minute dance performances, and a discounted ten dollar ticket program was initiated for in-person, cash-only purchases in the last 90 minutes before performances.|$|E

In July 1706, the Papal Legate Charles-Thomas Maillard De Tournon angered the Kangxi Emperor, who issued an order that all missionaries, {{in order to obtain}} an imperial permit (piao) to stay in China, would have to declare that they would follow ‘the rules of Matteo Ricci’.|$|E

5|$|The {{philosophical}} {{nature of}} the character has invited political critiques, and resulted in comparisons drawn against the political and philosophical views of other fictional characters.

5|$|A {{meeting of}} the {{parliamentary}} party was held on 15 September at which {{the issue of the}} presidential election was raised. Unexpectedly, one of the party's senators, Labhrás Ó Murchú, sought nominations to run as an independent candidate. This was widely seen as a <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> authority of Micheál Martin. The extended meeting broke up without agreement. The parliamentary party met again on 20 September. Senator Ó Murchú withdrew his request for a nomination and a motion was passed that the party's Oireachtas members would not nominate or endorse any candidate. The decision was seen as a severe blow to the attempts to secure a nomination by David Norris and Dana Rosemary Scallon who were expected to need signatures from individual Fianna Fáil members.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Rome, the key <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Empire was to {{maintain}} a set of relations between itself and its neighbours. When these nations set about forging formal political institutions, they often modelled themselves on Constantinople. Byzantine diplomacy soon managed to draw its neighbours into a network of international and inter-state relations. This network revolved around treaty making, and included the welcoming of the new ruler into the family of kings, and the assimilation of Byzantine social attitudes, values and institutions. Whereas classical writers are fond of making ethical and legal distinctions between peace and war, Byzantines regarded diplomacy {{as a form of}} war by other means. For example, a Bulgarian threat could be countered by providing money to the Kievan Rus'.|$|E
5|$|Cantor's {{theory of}} transfinite numbers was {{originally}} regarded as so counter-intuitive – even shocking – that it encountered resistance from mathematical contemporaries such as Leopold Kronecker and Henri Poincaré and later from Hermann Weyl and L. E. J. Brouwer, while Ludwig Wittgenstein raised philosophical objections. Cantor, a devout Lutheran, believed the theory had been communicated {{to him by}} God. Some Christian theologians (particularly neo-Scholastics) saw Cantor's work as a <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> uniqueness of the absolute infinity {{in the nature of}} God – on one occasion equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism – a proposition that Cantor vigorously rejected.|$|E
5|$|Cornwall, {{represented}} by the Cornwall Commonwealth Games Association (CCGA), sent a bid {{for participation in the}} 2006 Commonwealth Games, however, their application was rejected by the CGF, who stated that the constitutional status of Cornwall was not an issue that should be resolved through this medium. However, in 2010, the CCGA sought to launch a legal <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> decision of the CGF, stating that the Cornish bid of 2006 fulfilled the entire criterion of the CGF, and by rejecting the bid, the CGF had violated their own code, failing to follow their own criteria for participation. The Cornwall team will therefore seek competition in the 2014 games.|$|E

In 645, after Cenwalh of Wessex had renounced his wife, who was Penda's sister, Penda drove him from his kingdom and into exile. Anna {{was strong enough to}} offer protection to Cenwalh when he sought refuge at the East Anglian court: whilst there he was converted to Christianity, returning in 648 to rule Wessex as a Christian king. Anna probably provided military support for Cenwalh's return to his throne.|$|E

Ferguson issued a <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rebel militias {{to lay down their}} arms or suffer the consequences.

5|$|First Class entered {{production}} in August 2010, with principal photography concluding in December and additional filming finishing in April 2011, {{just a few}} weeks before the film's premiere in June 2011. The tight schedule proved a <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> six companies responsible for the extensive visual effects, which included computer-generated sets and digital doubles for the actors. Locations included Oxford, the Mojave desert and Georgia, with soundstage work done in both Pinewood Studios and the 20th Century Fox stages in Los Angeles. The depiction of the 1960s drew inspiration from the James Bond films of the period.|$|E

5|$|In 1895, Queen's University was {{the first}} {{official}} challenger for the Cup, although it was controversial. The Montreal Victorias had won the league title and thus the Stanley Cup, but the challenge match was between the previous year's champion, Montreal HC, and the university squad. The trustees decided that if the Montreal HC won the challenge match, the Victorias would become the Stanley Cup champions. The Montreal HC won the match 5–1 and their cross-town rivals were crowned the champions. The first successful <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cup came the next year by the Winnipeg Victorias, the champions of the Manitoba Hockey League. On February 14, 1896, the Winnipeg squad defeated the champions 2–0 {{and became the first}} team outside the AHAC to win the Cup.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Krug led the <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{constitutionality}} of the Children's Internet Protection Act. Her efforts led to a partial victory for the Act's opponents; the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the law was constitutional, but that internet filtering software on computers in public libraries could be turned off if so requested by an adult guardian. She said that filters used to censor Internet pornography from children were not perfect and risked blocking educational information about social matters, sexuality, and healthcare. She emphasized the need to educate children about morality instead of using online filters to block information from them. In 2006, she was elected Vice-President of the Phi Beta Kappa Society.|$|E

5|$|Its {{mixture of}} genres makes The General in His Labyrinth {{difficult}} to classify, and commentators disagree over where it {{lies on the}} scale between novel and historical account. García Márquez's insertion of interpretive and fictionalized elements—some dealing with Bolívar's most intimate moments—caused outrage in parts of Latin America when the book was released. Many prominent Latin American figures believed that the novel damaged the reputation {{of one of the}} region's most important historic figures and portrayed a negative image to the outside world. Others saw The General in His Labyrinth as a tonic for Latin American culture and a <b>challenge</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> region to deal with its problems.|$|E

The close-up shots and non-acrobatic sequences of the duel between Palpatine and Mace Windu were performed by McDiarmid.
