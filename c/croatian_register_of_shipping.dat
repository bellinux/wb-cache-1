40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is a {{comparison}} between two widely used non-linear models for the prediction of corrosion wastage on deck plates and stiffeners of oil tankers. Analysis of data is based on real corrosion thickness measurements of ship hull structural elements performed by the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Register</b> <b>of</b> <b>Shipping</b> (CRS), gauged on periodic dry-docking and close-up surveys of three oil tankers in service after 10, 15 and 20 years. The two non-linear corrosion models are fitted to the real corrosion thickness measurements of deck plates and longitudinals in ballast and cargo tanks after 10 and 15 years in order to predict the corrosion loss in the 20 th year. The uncertainty of corrosion propagation is then determined by the statistical analysis {{of the differences between}} the predicted and the measured corrosion thickness in the 20 th year...|$|E
