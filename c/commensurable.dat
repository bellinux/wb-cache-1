25|$|No Doppelgangers applies in {{both the}} Conversation Theory's {{kinematic}} domain (bounded by beginnings and ends) where times are <b>commensurable</b> and in the eternal kinetic Interactions of Actors domain where times are incommensurable.|$|E
25|$|Conversation {{is defined}} as having a {{beginning}} and an end and time is vectorial. The components of the vector are <b>commensurable</b> (in duration). On the other hand actor interaction time is vectorial with components that are incommensurable. In the general case there is no well-defined beginning and interaction goes on indefinitely. As a result the time vector has incommensurable components. Both {{the quantity and quality}} differ.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} was taken by Eudoxus of Cnidus, who formalized a new theory of {{proportion}} that took into account <b>commensurable</b> as well as incommensurable quantities. Central to his idea was the distinction between magnitude and number. A magnitude “...was not a number but stood for entities such as line segments, angles, areas, volumes, and time which could vary, as we would say, continuously. Magnitudes were opposed to numbers, which jumped from one value to another, as from 4 to 5.” Numbers are composed of some smallest, indivisible unit, whereas magnitudes are infinitely reducible. Because no quantitative values were assigned to magnitudes, Eudoxus was then able to account for both <b>commensurable</b> and incommensurable ratios by defining a ratio {{in terms of its}} magnitude, and proportion as an equality between two ratios. By taking quantitative values (numbers) out of the equation, he avoided the trap of having to express an irrational number as a number. “Eudoxus’ theory enabled the Greek mathematicians to make tremendous progress in geometry by supplying the necessary logical foundation for incommensurable ratios.” This incommensurability is dealt with in Euclid's Elements, Book X, Proposition 9.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{alternatives}} have advocates. The contrary constructivist position {{holds that}} human faculties and concepts are largely influenced by socially constructed and learned categories, without many biological restrictions. Another variant is idealist, {{which holds that}} human mental capacities are generally unrestricted by biological-material strictures. Another is essentialist, which holds that essential differences may influence the ways individuals or groups experience and conceptualize the world. Yet another is relativist (Cultural relativism), which sees different cultural groups as employing different conceptual schemes that are not necessarily compatible or <b>commensurable,</b> nor {{more or less in}} accord with external reality.|$|E
500|$|The {{statements}} about the obligatory nature {{of the terms of}} language have been taken to suggest that Whorf meant that language completely determined the scope of possible conceptualizations. However neo-Whorfians argue that here Whorf is writing about the terms in which we speak of the world, not the terms in which we think of it. Whorf noted that to communicate thoughts and experiences with members of a speech community speakers must use the linguistic categories of their shared language, which requires moulding experiences into the shape of language to speak them—a process called [...] "thinking for speaking". This interpretation is supported by Whorf's subsequent statement that [...] "No individual is free to describe nature with absolute impartiality, but is constrained by certain modes of interpretation even when he thinks himself most free". Similarly the statement that observers are led to different pictures of the universe has been understood as an argument that different conceptualizations are incommensurable making translation between different conceptual and linguistic systems impossible. Neo-Whorfians argue this to be is a misreading since throughout his work one of his main points was that such systems could be [...] "calibrated" [...] and thereby be made <b>commensurable,</b> but only when we become aware of the differences in conceptual schemes through linguistic analysis.|$|E

2500|$|Feyerabend {{considered}} the possibility of incommensurability, but he was hesitant in his application of the concept. He wrote that [...] "it is hardly ever possible to give an explicit definition of [...] " [...] , because it involves covert classifications and major conceptual changes. He also was critical of attempts to capture incommensurability in a logical framework, since he thought of incommensurability as a phenomenon outside the domain of logic. In the second appendix of Against Method (p.114), Feyerabend states, [...] "I never said... that any two rival theories are incommensurable... What I did say was that certain rival theories, so-called 'universal' theories, or 'non-instantial' theories, if interpreted in a certain way, could not be compared easily." [...] Incommensurability did not concern Feyerabend greatly, because he believed that even when theories are <b>commensurable</b> (i.e. can be compared), {{the outcome of the}} comparison should not necessarily rule out either theory. To rephrase: when theories are incommensurable, they cannot rule each other out, and when theories are <b>commensurable,</b> they cannot rule each other out. Assessments of (in)commensurability, therefore, don't have much effect in Feyerabend's system, and can be more or less passed over in silence.|$|E
2500|$|The rule {{implies that}} in a {{physically}} meaningful expression only quantities of the same dimension can be added, subtracted, or compared. For example, if mman, mrat and Lman denote, respectively, the mass of some man, the mass of a rat {{and the length of}} that man, the dimensionally homogeneous expression [...] is meaningful, but the heterogeneous expression [...] is meaningless. However, mman/L2man is fine. Thus, dimensional analysis may be used as a sanity check of physical equations: the two sides of any equation must be <b>commensurable</b> or have the same dimensions.|$|E
2500|$|Every {{resultant}} {{is either}} a sum or a difference of the co-operant forces; their sum, when their directions are the same – their difference, when their directions are contrary. [...] Further, every resultant is clearly traceable in its components, because these are homogeneous and <b>commensurable.</b> It is otherwise with emergents, when, instead of adding measurable motion to measurable motion, or things of one kind to other individuals of their kind, there is a co-operation of things of unlike kinds. The emergent is unlike its components insofar as these are incommensurable, and it cannot be reduced to their sum or their difference.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{physical}} dimension {{was introduced by}} Joseph Fourier in 1822. Physical quantities that are {{of the same kind}} (also called <b>commensurable),</b> have the same dimension (length, time, mass) and can be directly compared to each other, even if they are originally expressed in differing units of measure (such as inches and meters, or pounds and newtons). [...] If physical quantities have different dimensions (such as length vs. mass), they cannot be expressed in terms of similar units and cannot be compared in quantity (also called incommensurable). For example, asking whether a kilogram is greater than, equal to, or less than an hour is meaningless.|$|E
2500|$|The then-current Pythagorean method {{would have}} claimed {{that there must be}} some {{sufficiently}} small, indivisible unit that could fit evenly into one of these lengths as well as the other. However, Hippasus, in the 5th century BC, was able to deduce that there was in fact no common unit of measure, and that the assertion of such an existence was in fact a contradiction. He did this by demonstrating that if the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle was indeed <b>commensurable</b> with a leg, then one of those lengths measured in that unit of measure must be both odd and even, which is impossible. His reasoning is as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Kuhn, the {{scientific}} paradigms preceding and succeeding {{a paradigm shift}} are so different that their theories are incommensurable [...] the new paradigm cannot be proven or disproven {{by the rules of}} the old paradigm, and vice versa. (A later interpretation by Kuhn of 'commensurable' versus 'incommensurable' was as a distinction between languages, namely, that statements in <b>commensurable</b> languages were translatable fully from one to the other, while in incommensurable languages, strict translation is not possible.) The paradigm shift does not merely involve the revision or transformation of an individual theory, it changes the way terminology is defined, how the scientists in that field view their subject, and, perhaps most significantly, what questions are regarded as valid, and what rules are used to determine the truth of a particular theory. The new theories were not, as the scientists had previously thought, just extensions of old theories, but were instead completely new world views.|$|E
2500|$|The {{discovery}} of incommensurable ratios was indicative of another problem facing the Greeks: {{the relation of}} the discrete to the continuous. Brought into light by Zeno of Elea, who questioned the conception that quantities are discrete and composed of a finite number of units of a given size. Past Greek conceptions dictated that they necessarily must be, for “whole numbers represent discrete objects, and a <b>commensurable</b> ratio represents a relation between two collections of discrete objects.” However Zeno found that in fact “ in general are not discrete collections of units; this is why ratios of incommensurable [...] appear….uantities are, in other words, continuous.” What this means is that, contrary to the popular conception of the time, there cannot be an indivisible, smallest unit of measure for any quantity. That in fact, these divisions of quantity must necessarily be infinite. For example, consider a line segment: this segment can be split in half, that half split in half, the half of the half in half, and so on. This process can continue infinitely, for there is always another half to be split. The more times the segment is halved, the closer the unit of measure comes to zero, but it never reaches exactly zero. This is just what Zeno sought to prove. He sought to prove this by formulating four paradoxes, which demonstrated the contradictions inherent in the mathematical thought of the time. While Zeno’s paradoxes accurately demonstrated the deficiencies of current mathematical conceptions, they were not regarded as proof of the alternative. In the minds of the Greeks, disproving the validity of one view did not necessarily prove the validity of another, and therefore further investigation had to occur.|$|E
60|$|Let me repeat in {{slightly}} altered terms {{some of the}} points raised in the preceding sections. I have doubted and denied that there are identically similar objective experiences; I consider all objective beings as individual and unique. It is now understood that conceivably only in the subjective world, and in theory and the imagination, do we deal with identically similar units, and with absolutely <b>commensurable</b> quantities. In the real world {{it is reasonable to}} suppose we deal at most with PRACTICALLY similar units and PRACTICALLY <b>commensurable</b> quantities. But there is a strong bias, a sort of labour-saving bias, in the normal human mind, to ignore this, and not only to speak but to think of a thousand bricks or a thousand sheep or a thousand Chinamen as though they were all absolutely true to sample. If it is brought before a thinker for a moment that in any special case this is not so, he slips back to the old attitude as soon as his attention is withdrawn. This type of error has, for instance, caught many of the race of chemists, and ATOMS and IONS and so forth of the same species are tacitly assumed to be similar to one another.|$|E
60|$|Let {{me begin}} by {{pointing}} out that, in the more modern conceptions of logic, it is recognised {{that there are no}} identically similar objective experiences; the disposition is to conceive all real objective being as individual and unique. This is not a singular eccentric idea of mine; it is one for which ample support {{is to be found in}} the writings of absolutely respectable contemporaries, who are quite untainted by association with fiction. It is now understood that conceivably only in the subjective world, and in theory and the imagination, do we deal with identically similar units, and with absolutely <b>commensurable</b> quantities. In the real world it is reasonable to suppose we deal at most with practically similar units and practically <b>commensurable</b> quantities. But there is a strong bias, a sort of labour-saving bias in the normal human mind to ignore this, and not only to speak but to think of a thousand bricks or a thousand sheep or a thousand sociologists as though they were all absolutely true to sample. If it is brought before a thinker for a moment that in any special case this is not so, he slips back to the old attitude as soon as his attention is withdrawn. This source of error has, for instance, caught nearly the whole race of chemists, with one or two distinguished exceptions, and atoms and ions and so forth of the same species are tacitly assumed to be similar one to another. Be it noted that, so far as the practical results of chemistry and physics go, it scarcely matters which assumption we adopt. For purposes of inquiry and discussion the incorrect one is infinitely more convenient.|$|E

There is nothing in the whole range of sexual fact that may not seem supremely beautiful or humanly jolly or magnificently wicked or disgusting or trivial or utterly insignificant, according to the eye that sees or the mood that colours. Here is something that may fill the skies and every waking hour or be almost completely banished from a life. It may be everything on Monday and less than nothing on Saturday.

6000|$|At {{first sight}} The Ring and the Book {{appears to be}} {{absolutely}} wanting in that grandeur which, in a composition of such enormous length, criticism must pronounce to be a fundamental and indispensable element. In an ordinary way this effect of grandeur is produced either by some heroic action surrounded by circumstances of worthy stateliness, as in the finest of the Greek plays; or as in Paradise Lost {{by the presence of}} personages of majestic sublimity of bearing and association; or as in Faust or Hamlet by the stupendous moral abysses which the poet discloses fitfully on this side and that. None of these things {{are to be found in}} The Ring and the Book The action of Caponsacchi, though noble and disinterested, is hardly heroic in the highest dramatic sense, for it is not much more than the lofty defiance of a conventionality, the contemplated penalty being only small; not, for example, as if life or ascertained happiness had been the fixed or even probable price of his magnanimous enterprise. There was no marching to the stake, no deliberate encountering of the mightier risks, no voluntary submission to a lifelong endurance. True, this came in the end, but it was an end unforeseen, and one, therefore, not to be associated with the first conception of the original act. Besides, Guido is so saturated with hateful and ignoble motive as to fill the surrounding air with influences that preclude heroic association. It has been said of the great men to whom the Byzantine Empire once or twice gave birth, that even their fame has a curiously tarnished air, as if that too had been touched by the evil breath of the times. And in like manner we may say of Guido Franceschini that even to have touched him in the way of resistance detracts from pure heroism. Perhaps the same consideration explains the comparative disappointment which most people seem to have felt with Pompilia in the third volume. Again, there is nothing which can be rightly called majesty of character visible in one personage or another. There is high devotion in Caponsacchi, a large-minded and free sagacity in Pope Innocent, and around Pompilia the tragic pathos of an incurable woe, which by its intensity might raise her to grandeur if it sprang from some more solemn source than the mere malignity and baseness of an unworthy oppressor. Lastly, there is nothing in The Ring and the Book of that [...] "certain incommensurableness" [...] which Goethe found in his own Faust.
