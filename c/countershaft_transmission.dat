50|$|In 1988, Mack Trucks Australia made 16 {{special edition}} SuperLiner II Bicentennials with the E9-500 V8, Mack 12 speed triple <b>countershaft</b> <b>transmission,</b> Mack {{front and rear}} axles, long taper-leaf springs on front and {{camelback}} on the rear, Spicer 1810 HD driveshafts and 5842mm (230 inch) wheelbase. The special limited edition models were named after people influential to Australian history, including James Cook, Captain Bligh, Ludwig Leichhardt, Governor Phillip, Ned Kelly, Kingsford Smith, and John Flynn William Hovell. One remaining example is operated by Eagle Towing Service, of Ringwood Victoria and has since been converted to a heavy towing salvage truck. Two more Remaining examples are from Mactrans Heavy Haulage who own Captain Starlight and Thumderbolt.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: After heat treatment, {{the surface}} {{hardness}} and effective depth of hardened layers of automotive <b>transmission</b> <b>countershaft,</b> determines {{the quality of}} the part itself as well as the normal and reliable operation of the transmission assembly. The paper analyzes the specific reasons for such problems as soft zone on the hardened surface of <b>transmission</b> <b>countershaft</b> when proceeding with carbonitriding in the controlled atmosphere furnace, a multi-purpose furnace. And with process parameters adjusted, the process parameters of heat treatment are corrected that the soft zone has been eliminated and the quality of parts has been effectively controlled...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a model is {{developed}} for calculating the loads on the wetclutches in apowershift transmission. This thesis {{was done at}} Volvo CE in Eskilstuna and is focusedon their 4 -speed <b>countershaft</b> <b>transmissions.</b> The goal of the project {{is to be able}} tocalculate the loads automatically during the transmission tests and thus acquire increasedknowledge about what occurs during operation. The model was developed by first generating a number of concepts and then evalu-ating them to decide which one should be developed further. The chosen concept wasthen developed further and implemented into the test equipment as a calculation script. The chosen loads to model were the energy absorbed in each clutch, the coefficient offriction (COF) and the slip distance. The COF was later found to give too unreliableresults to be used in any other way than as a benchmark for how well the model wasconfigured and to see any large changes in COF. The model was validated by calculating the energy absorbed in a HTE- 200 seriestransmission and comparing it to a reference calculation model. It was seen that theresults from the new model are very close to the reference result. The energy lostcalculated by the new model will be equal to 94 % of the energy lost calculated by thereference model, but only when measuring the inertia phase. The energy lost is equalto 135 % when the torque phase is included. The increasing difference is believed tobe because of an error in the reference model that means it does not cover the torquephase...|$|R
50|$|The car had an {{air-cooled}} 8 hp V-twin cylinder Chater-Lea engine {{driving the}} rear wheels through a two speed transmission with top gear being direct and the lower gear a chain reduction system. Reverse gear was obtained by diverting the drive through two friction wheels, one {{on the front of}} the propeller shaft and a larger one connected to the low gear <b>countershaft</b> in the <b>transmission.</b> The footbrake operated on {{the rear wheels}} with internal expanding shoes and the handbrake controlled a leather faced band contracting onto the main drive shaft. The final drive to the rear axle used a worm drive reduction system.|$|R
50|$|The Premier cyclecar was {{launched}} in 1912. Described at the 1912 Motor Cycle and Cycle Car Show as 'a smart looking two-seater vehicle with coachwork torpedo-type body at 100 guineas'. The engine was a 998 cc air-cooled V-twin (85mm bore, 88mm stroke) with special heavy flywheel for cyclecar work and Bosch magneto. The transmission included a leather cone clutch and two speed gearbox (with reverse), and the rear axle included a differential, there was enclosed chain drive throughout. The chassis was of 'tubular trussed construction' with half elliptic front springing and quarter elliptic rear. The brakes comprised a foot operated band brake operating on the <b>transmission</b> <b>countershaft,</b> and two internally expanding brakes on the rear axle operated by the hand brake lever.|$|R
