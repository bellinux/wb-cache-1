500|$|Los Angeles had {{acquired}} Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Washington's {{style of play}} complemented him, as Abdul-Jabbar was not an especially physical player. Washington played well, averaging 9.7 points and 9.3 rebounds; however, he struggled with tendinitis in his knee the entire season. His wife pleaded with him to sit out some games, but he took painkillers and kept playing. Washington finally tore the patella tendon in a late season game against Denver. [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> tearing inside. I looked down, and my kneecap was hanging {{on the side of}} my leg." [...] Doctors covered his entire leg in a cast and told him his basketball career was most likely over.|$|E
500|$|Pulvermacher {{patented}} {{the chain}} battery in the US in 1853. [...] This was soon {{followed by the}} wearable chain battery belt, or electric belt. [...] Electric belts became enormously popular in the US, far {{more so than in}} Europe. [...] This led to the company headquarters being moved to Cincinnati by the 1880s as the Pulvermacher Galvanic Company, but still calling themselves Pulvermacher's of London for the prestige of a European connection. [...] Early models had to be soaked in vinegar before use as in England, but later on models that worked purely by galvanic action with body sweat were introduced. [...] Since the device was being sold essentially as a quack cure it was only necessary to generate enough electricity that the wearer <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it,</b> no matter how slightly, and know that it was working.|$|E
500|$|On the reveal, Dohring {{said in an}} interview: [...] "I’m {{actually}} glad, Rob told {{us about}} episode six or seven that we would get together. We were like, ‘No way!’ But there was something going on there. We <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> as actors. It was damn cool – these characters {{had some kind of}} connection. So we had to start to soften {{it up a little bit}} and break the ice somewhat [...] I’m glad he gave us that heads up." [...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. You look like you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to just let it go for the scene. It was so fun to watch ," [...] adding that [...] "a lot of that emotion was real for me." [...] The song [...] "Momentary Thing" [...] by band Something Happens plays during Veronica and Logan's first kiss.|$|E

6000|$|He {{stumbled}} across the landing and plunged into Torpenhow's room. He <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>it</b> {{was full of}} men. 'Where's the trouble?' said he. 'In the Balkans at last? Why didn't some one tell me?' ...|$|R
500|$|Konami {{video game}} {{developer}} Tomm Hulett described Kefka as a pure villain, stating [...] "Unlike most Japanese stories, Kefka {{did not have}} shades of gray. He didn't have a tragic past that {{turned him into a}} sadistic clown that you felt sorry for him over. He didn't have some greater purpose that he lost sight of. Yet, at the same time, he wasn't 'evil for evil's sake.' There was something twisted and nasty inside him that MADE him that way... and you <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it...</b> but you also knew there wasn't any good in there." [...] That he is a central villain of the entire game also serves to intensify a players negative fixation on him. In a review of Final Fantasy VI Advance, IGN stated [...] "it's the game's maniacal nihilist Kefka that really stands out. The most evil and destructive villain in the entire Final Fantasy franchise, Kefka's brutality and ruthlessness is unmatched and he has to be seen to be believed." [...] IGN also noted his ability to [...] "tap into primal, instinctive fears", including fears of clowns. CNet in their own review described him as [...] "the unrivaled star of the show...he's the kind of villain that you will love to hate", comparing him to Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker and calling his laugh one of the greatest sound effects in any video game. Kotaku has called Kefka the greatest video game villain of all time, and attempted to explain players' lasting fascination by noting that he inspires such hatred that when his evil plans are finally thwarted, the sense of joy from victory is so much the greater. GameSpy compared Kefka's final form as a representation of Lucifer, highlighted by his powerful [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] attack. Another theory posited by GameSpot is that the intense reaction to Kefka {{stems from the fact that}} he is one of the few villains in Final Fantasy, or any game, that succeeds at his master plan before he is defeated.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2011, The Rowdy Rams {{followed}} the men's basketball team to Houston for the Final Four. Despite the team's upset by Butler University, the fan organization never regretted their trip. [...] "Our Rowdy Rams {{came here in}} full force; the spirit was on the court; you <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> all around the arena." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Head of the IOC {{evaluation}} commission {{praised the}} passion behind the London 2012 bid when they visited Stratford {{and other places}} in the city. The IOC evaluation commission chair Nawal El Moutawakel speaking at a press conference in London observed: [...] "We <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it,</b> hear it and see it." [...] She added, [...] "It was in every speech and every word." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{suspect he}} was never so disgusted and appalled in his life. His self-command is the most admirable worldly thing I have ever seen. What made it {{beautiful}} was that one <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> in <b>it</b> a tragic suggestion as in a great work of art.” ...|$|R
60|$|Now {{it must be}} {{understood}} that we could see nothing; the darkness was so intense that one <b>could</b> almost <b>feel</b> <b>it,</b> and yet we proposed to blunder in upon enemies who would probably shoot without warning {{in the direction of}} the slightest suspicious noise.|$|R
60|$|March, to whom {{his wife}} mainly left their obeisance, {{made it so}} {{tentative}} that if it should meet no response he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>it</b> had been {{nothing more than a}} forward stoop, such as was natural in sitting down. He need not really have taken this precaution; those whose eyes he caught more or less nodded in return.|$|R
2500|$|Kudrow {{was cast}} {{to play the}} role of Roz Doyle in Frasier, but the role was re-cast with Peri Gilpin during the filming of the pilot episode. Kudrow said in 2000 that when rehearsals started, [...] "I knew it wasn't working. I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> all {{slipping}} away, and I was panicking, which only made things worse". Her first recurring television role was Ursula Buffay, the eccentric waitress on the NBC sitcom Mad About You. Kudrow would reprise the character on the NBC sitcom Friends, in which Kudrow co-starred as massage therapist Phoebe Buffay, Ursula's twin sister.|$|E
2500|$|Godard wrote a {{detailed}} script {{for the film}} that included both text and storyboards; however, instead of a traditional script, the scenario consisted of [...] "a series of written prose pieces with jottings and ideas." [...] Kamel Abdeli {{said that he had}} to google all the references in the script so that he could understand it, stating, [...] "you couldn't read the scenario – you <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> and look at it." [...] Actor Daniel Ludwig wrote that [...] "Alongside sibylline texts and the master's own handmade collages and images, the screenplay is wildly, chaotically, wonderfully suggestive, an artwork." ...|$|E
2500|$|Facing forward, Moore {{could not}} see Sanchez miss the handoff, but he recalls that [...] "You <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it,</b> you knew {{something}} wasn't right." [...] When the fumble occurred, Moore was not aware that his buttocks had caused it; he learned of his role only after the game. When asked about the play, Moore answered, [...] "Why do I {{need to talk about}} that? I don't understand why y’all keep asking about that play. ... I think it was a miscue with the handoff." [...] After consulting Sanchez and his assistant coaches, Jets head coach Rex Ryan echoed the analysis: [...] "My understanding is, I thought [...] reversed out the wrong way. That's what happened. It was a mental mistake and then he just tried to slide. When he did, he actually ran into Brandon." ...|$|E
5000|$|Larry Flick of Billboard {{stated that}} the album [...] "combines the sample-happy {{experimental}} sound of the electronic underground with traditional pop sounds." [...] Randall Roberts of CMJ New Music Monthly called it [...] "slow, deep, sexy nighttime music, so richly recorded and alive with pleasure that only the extremely sexually repressed <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> down there." ...|$|R
60|$|Lucilla {{knew her}} fate {{as well as}} if his long coat had been a cowl. She would not, <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> yet. She must keep up appearances, so she fixed her eyes {{steadily}} on the drawing her idle hands were perpetrating {{on the back of}} a letter, and appeared absorbed in shading a Turk's head.|$|R
60|$|And on Sunday she {{was content}} to teach the stupid girls, and abstain from making much of the smooth-faced {{engaging}} set. She thought it very dull work, but she <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>it</b> was something not done to please herself; and whereas her father had feared she would be dull when her cousins were gone, he found her more joyous than ever.|$|R
2500|$|In 1955, Coltrane married Naima (born Juanita Grubbs). Naima Coltrane, who {{was already}} a Muslim convert, heavily {{influenced}} his spirituality. [...] When they married, Naima had a five-year-old daughter named Antonia, later named Saeeda. Coltrane adopted Saeeda. Coltrane met Naima {{at the home of}} bassist Steve Davis in Philadelphia. The love ballad he wrote to honor his wife, [...] "Naima" [...] was Coltrane's favorite composition. In 1956 the couple left Philadelphia with their six-year-old daughter in tow and moved to New York City. [...] In August 1957, Coltrane, Naima and Saeeda moved into an apartment on 103d St. and Amsterdam Ave. in New York, near Central Park West. A few years later, John and Naima Coltrane purchased a home on Long Island on Mexico Street. This is the house where they would eventually break up in 1963. Said Naima about the break in J.C. Thomas's Chasin' the Trane: [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> was going to happen sooner or later, so I wasn't really surprised when John moved out of the house in the summer of 1963. He didn't offer any explanation. He just told me there were things he had to do, and he left only with his clothes and his horns. He stayed in a hotel sometimes, other times with his mother in Philadelphia. All he said was, 'Naima, I'm going to make a change.' Even though I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> coming, it hurt, and I didn't get over it for at least another year." [...] But Coltrane kept a close relationship with Naima, even calling her in 1964 to tell her that 90% of his playing would be prayer. [...] Coltrane would be dead in four years, but he always kept in touch with her. Naima brought serenity and a calmness into his life. All who knew Naima described her gentle spirit and serenity. They remained in touch until his death in 1967. Naima Coltrane {{died of a heart attack}} in October 1996.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, {{you could}} never be a casuist!" [...] she exclaimed, {{with a touch of}} vehemence. [...] "You are much too positive. It is just that note, which is {{characteristic}} of so many clergymen, that note of smoothing-over and apology, which you lack. I <b>could</b> never <b>feel</b> <b>it,</b> even when you were orthodox. And now--" [...] words failed her as she inspected his ruggedness.|$|R
60|$|To sit {{staring at}} those fixed glazed eyes in silence, for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. There was {{something}} very awful, too, in the spectre's being provided with an infernal atmosphere of his own. Scrooge <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts, and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven.|$|R
60|$|While Dan {{steered the}} boat R. C. got {{out on the}} bow and gaffed the kite. I watched the tuna tails {{standing}} like half-simitars out of the smooth, colored water. The sun was setting in a golden haze spotted by pink clouds. The wind, if anything, was softer than ever; in fact, we <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> unless we headed the boat into it. The fellow below us was drifting off farther, still plugging at his tuna.|$|R

60|$|G.S. (With a soft {{reminiscent}} sigh {{suggestive of}} bygone joys {{that may be}} tasted in their freshness but once.) Ah, I {{know what it is}} to you. A first visit!--ah, the romance of it! I wish I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> again.|$|E
60|$|Whitwell led {{him into}} the little dark front hall, and into the parlor, less dim {{than it should have}} been because the {{afternoon}} sun was burning full upon its shutters.

50|$|En Un Lugar Sin Dios: Talks {{about those}} states of {{nervousness}} {{and at the}} same time parsimonious called dreams, how real they are; and how <b>could</b> <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> to be a witness and the main character of a burial.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Robson, the mother, was vexed {{and half}} angry. She said she hated common shop-work, and {{ready-made}} things, {{and she had}} taken a fancy to what she had seen of Miss Lee's work. She even offered to increase the payment, but Rose Lee stood firm. She {{said there was no}} one at hand whom she could hire and entrust with such work, and that she <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> right to undertake it, as it would only lead to breaking her engagements.|$|R
60|$|He had {{gripped the}} arms of her chair, till she <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> quiver beneath her. Would he drive his fist into her face that she managed to keep still smiling? But there only passed into his eyes an {{expression}} which she could not read.|$|E
60|$|Immediately {{the cannon}} had been {{discharged}} Captain Hanaford {{was on his}} feet, grasping the tiller {{as if it was}} possible to steer the pungy while the blackness continued so dense that one might fancy he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it,</b> and then came the glare of more rockets.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{see what}} I mean?" [...] he asked dubiously. She made no reply. How could she see? [...] "This scene is so clear and pure and remote; {{you need the}} {{corresponding}} emotion. Those people were out of harmony. They weren't clear and pure enough." [...] He {{seemed to be getting}} more muddled than ever. [...] "It's an emotion of the young and of the old. You <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it,</b> I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it.</b> Those people couldn't." [...] He was feeling his way through obscurities. Where would he finally arrive? [...] "Certain poems express it. You know Francis Jammes? I have thought so much of his work lately. Art instead of life, as usual; but then I'm made that way. I can't help thinking of Jammes. Those delicate, exquisite things he wrote about Clara d'Ellébeuse." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was about}} half-way on my road home, and I had {{just heard the}} clock of a village church strike ten, when I became conscious, little by little, of a chilly {{sensation}} slowly creeping through and through me to the bones.

500|$|On September 21, Brian {{completed}} the track after Tanner added a final Electro-Theremin overdub. In 1976 he elaborated on the event: [...] "It was at Columbia. I remember I {{had it right}} in the sack. I <b>could</b> just <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> when I dubbed it down, made the final mix from the 16-track down to mono. It was a feeling of power, it was a rush. A feeling of exaltation. Artistic beauty. It was everything ... I remember saying, 'Oh my God. Sit back and listen to this!'" ...|$|R
