25|$|A Class 1M laser is {{safe for}} all <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> except when passed through {{magnifying}} optics such as microscopes and telescopes. Class1M lasers produce large-diameter beams, or beams that are divergent. The MPE for a Class1M laser cannot normally be exceeded unless focusing or imaging optics {{are used to}} narrow the beam. If the beam is refocused, the hazard of Class1M lasers may be increased and the product class may be changed. A laser can be classified as Class1M if the power that can pass through the pupil of the naked eye {{is less than the}} AEL for Class1, but the power that can be collected into the eye by typical magnifying optics (as defined in the standard) is higher than the AEL for Class1 and lower than the AEL for Class3B.|$|E
