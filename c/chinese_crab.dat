40|$|The {{arrival of}} the <b>Chinese</b> mitten <b>crab</b> to the San Francisco Bay-San Joaquin Delta (Bay- Delta) {{ecosystem}} {{has been a source}} of widespread concern. This crab has spread from its native range, in China, to coastal ecosystems throughout Europe and, most recently, into North America. The <b>Chinese</b> mitten <b>crab</b> population in California has exploded within the last decade to cover hundreds of miles of the Bay-Delta and its tributaries. The <b>Chinese</b> mitten <b>crab</b> is a large, catadromous crab, moving from freshwater habitats where it spends its juvenile years to saltwater habitats in order to reproduce. In other countries into which this species has been introduced, the abundance and behavior of the crab has caused detrimental impacts to fisheries and loss of bank stability in areas where it burrows. Through a grant from the Water Resources Center, we set out to examine the ecology, distribution, and economic and ecological impacts of the <b>Chinese</b> mitten <b>crab</b> in the fresh and saline waters of San Francisco’s South Bay. The <b>Chinese</b> mitten <b>crab</b> offers excellent opportunities to: 1) study the population dynamics of an invasive species; 2) examine differences and similarities for this organism between its native and new environments; and 3) use research findings to make recommendations for understanding and control of this organism...|$|R

40|$|Isolated {{posterior}} gills {{from the}} <b>Chinese</b> <b>crab</b> Eriocheir sinensis acclimated to freshwater (FW) {{were used for}} perfusion. Dopamine and dibutyryl cAMP (db-cAMP) induced a significant increase of 36 Cl - influx. When amiloride, a specific sodium selective channels blocker, {{was added to the}} incubation saline, it induced a dramatic decrease of 22 Na + influx, and such ail effect could be reversed by dopamine or db-cAMP. In the same experimental condition, we observed that ouabain added to the scrosal side induced a marked decrease of the stimulating effect of db-cAMP on 22 Na + uptake across the epithelium to the hemolymph, suggesting that dopamine stimulates Na + and Cl - influxes via cAMP and Na + /K + -ATPase pathways...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe hexose part of {{glycolysis}} {{has been}} studied in the freshwater <b>Chinese</b> <b>crab</b> Eriocheir sinensis exposed to high pressure (101 ATA, i. e. 1000 m depth) at 14 degrees C and in normoxic conditions. Glycolytic fluxes (from glucose, JA and from Glucose 6 Phosphate, JB) have been determined using NADH depletion during the conversion of dihydroxy acetone phosphate into alpha-glycerol phosphate. Measurements have been performed at 14 and 19 degrees C. Pressure exposure induces an increase of glycolytic flux and a decrease of the time needed for the transition from aerobic to anaerobic glycolysis. As a consequence pressure-exposed crabs have a higher potential to increase glycolytic flux than control animals at atmospheric pressure. It is concluded that high pressure known to alter numerous enzymes individually, can also modify an overall metabolic pathway...|$|E

40|$|Fish oil {{supplies}} worldwide have declined sharply over the years. To reduce {{the use of}} fish oil in aquaculture, many studies have explored the effects of fish oil substitutions on aquatic animals. To illustrate the effects of dietary lipids on <b>Chinese</b> mitten <b>crab</b> and to improve the use of vegetable oils in the diet of the crabs, 60 male juvenile <b>Chinese</b> mitten <b>crabs</b> were fed one of five diets for 116 days: fish oil (FO), soybean oil (SO), linseed oil (LO), FO + SO (1 : 1, FSO), and FO + LO (1 : 1, FLO). Changes in the crab hepatopancreas transcriptome were analyzed using RNA sequencing. There were a total 55, 167 unigenes obtained from the transcriptome, of which the expression of 3030 was significantly altered in the FLO vs. FO groups, but the expression of only 412 unigenes was altered in the FSO vs. FO groups. The diets significantly altered the expression of many enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, such as pancreatic lipase, long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, and fatty acyl Δ 9 -desaturase. The dietary lipids also affected the Toll-like receptor and Janus activated kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling pathways. Our results indicate that substituting fish oil with vegetable oils in the diet of <b>Chinese</b> mitten <b>crabs</b> might decrease the digestion and absorption of dietary lipids, fatty acids biosynthesis, and immunologic viral defense, and increase β-oxidation by altering {{the expression of the}} relevant genes.

40|$|The <b>Chinese</b> mitten <b>crab,</b> Eriocheir sinensis, has {{a history}} of invasions in {{numerous}} countries. In 1992, the <b>Chinese</b> mitten <b>crab</b> was introduced to the San Francisco Bay/Delta system. Since its invasion in the San Francisco Bay, it has become an aquatic nuisance species. Little is known about the population dynamics of the megalopa stage of the <b>Chinese</b> mitten <b>crab</b> in the San Francisco Bay estuary, particularly the megalopa stage. Light traps are often used to sample marine larvae and can provide measures for relative abundance of larvae between sampling locations. As part of an ongoing study to monitor mitten crab larvae in the San Francisco Bay, light trap and plankton tow samples were analyzed for mitten crab megalopae and zoeae. In order to implement low cost sampling devices for mitten crab megalopae such as light traps, it is necessary to be able to identify their larvae in collected samples. Thus, the main objective of this work was to develop a means to distinguish mitten crab megalopae from other native and invasive brachyuran megalopae inhabiting the San Francisco Bay Estuary. The minimal amount of mitten crab megalopae found in light trap samples may be linked to the recent decline of mitten crab zoeae in San Pablo Bay...|$|R

40|$|Background: The <b>Chinese</b> mitten <b>crab,</b> Eriocheir sinensis, {{is one of}} {{the most}} studied and {{economically}} important crustaceans in China. Its transition from a swimming to a crawling method of movement during early development, anadromous migration during growth, and catadromous migration during breeding have been attractive features for research. However, knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms that regulate these processes is still very limited. Findings: A total of 258. 8 gigabases (Gb) of raw reads from whole-genome sequencing of the crab were generated by the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. The final genome assembly (1. 12 Gb), about 67. 5 % of the estimated genome size (1. 66 Gb), is composed of 17, 553 scaffolds (> 2 kb) with an N 50 of 224 kb. We identified 14, 436 genes using AUGUSTUS, of which 7, 549 were shown to have significant supporting evidence using the GLEAN pipeline. This gene number is much greater than that of the horseshoe crab, and the annotation completeness, as evaluated by CEGMA, reached 66. 9 %. Conclusions: We report the first genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation of the <b>Chinese</b> mitten <b>crab.</b> The assembled draft genome will provide a valuable resource for the study of essential developmental processes and genetic determination of important traits of the <b>Chinese</b> mitten <b>crab,</b> and also for investigating crustacean evolution...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Chinese</b> mitten <b>crab,</b> {{native to}} coastal rivers and {{estuaries}} of central Asia, has invaded several European countries {{over the past}} century, causing widespread concern because of its periodically extreme abundance and burrowing behavior that causes bank erosion. San Francisco Bay and its tributaries contain the first and, currently, only known established population of the <b>Chinese</b> mitten <b>crab</b> in North America. Discovered in South San Francisco Bay in 1992, the mitten crab has spread rapidly to cover several thousand km 2 surrounding the Bay. Between 1995 and 2001, we monitored distribution, population dynamics, and life history attributes of the <b>Chinese</b> mitten <b>crab</b> in San Francisco Bay and its tributaries. Burrow densities increased from a mean of 6 burrows/m 2 in 1995 to> 30 burrows/m 2 in 1999 in tidal portions of South Bay tributaries. Mitten crabs are associated with: tidally influenced portions of Bay tributaries as young juveniles; with freshwater streams (≤ 250 km from their confluence with the Bay) as older, migrating juveniles; and with the open wa-ters of the Bay as reproductive adults after migrating from fresh water to reproduce between late fall and early spring.
