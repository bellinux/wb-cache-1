25|$|Obama {{has spoken}} out {{numerous}} times against {{the influence of}} lobbying in the United States. He also co-sponsored legislation that limits lobbyists' influence by mandating that lawmakers pay full <b>charter</b> <b>fare</b> when flying on lobbyists' corporate jets.|$|E
50|$|Owing to fierce {{competition}} from other airlines that pushed <b>charter</b> <b>fares</b> down, the airline's relatively small size compared to its Northern European competitors {{and the lack of}} significant amounts of passenger bookings during the winter season, Centennial Airlines soon faced serious financial difficulties. Finally Centennial Airlines went bankrupt in 1995 and ceased operations in 1996.|$|R
5000|$|Considerable {{criticism}} has been levelled against this practice, both by Hindu organisations opposed to state funding of private pilgrimage outside India and by Muslim pressure groups. As {{an example of}} the latter, Mohib Ahmad contends that even Air India's subsidised fare is higher than competing airlines' ordinary fare. However, the government has continued offering the Haj subsidy despite protests from the Muslim community at large. Syed Shahabuddin claims that Air India's rising costs for travel, and the consequent increases in the Government of India's subsidy, have resulted partly from differences in foreign exchange rates beyond the airline's control. He suggests <b>charter</b> <b>fares</b> should be set at two-thirds of regular IATA fares, but points out that the Haj has higher costs than other charters because two empty flights are required to return the aircraft to India and to position the aircraft in Arabia for the pilgrims' return journey. Shahabuddin maintains that the subsidy ought to be phased out because Hindus view the subsidy as preferential treatment of India's Muslim minority. Zafarul Islam Khan states that,"Muslims in general are not in favour of the Hajj subsidy. We consider the subsidy as a subsidy to Air India and not to the Muslim community." ...|$|R
40|$|The for-hire sector plays a {{significant}} role in providing recreational fishing opportunities for Atlantic highly migratory species (HMS) such as tuna, billfish, swordfish, and sharks. Because of the high cost of equipment needed to pursue HMS, many saltwater anglers find chartering a for-hire vessel to be the only affordable alternative. In 2013, there were 3, 968 licensed Atlantic HMS Charter/Headboat (CHB) permit holders from Maine to Texas that took an estimated 12, 965 for-hire vessel trips in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (not including Texas) to pursue HMS from July to December of 2013. During this time period, NOAA Fisheries conducted a log-book study of randomly selected Atlantic HMS Charter/Headboat (CHB) permit holders to collect trip cost and earnings data. Data were collected on 596 for-hire trips targeting Atlantic HMS. Approximately 68 percent of HMS for-hire trips targeted a combination of pelagic species (most commonly yellowfin tuna, swordfish, or marlin) while 32 percent targeted coastal sharks. Average <b>charter</b> <b>fares</b> for HMS <b>charter</b> boat (6 anglers or fewer) trips ranged from $ 1, 223 in the Southeast (NC - FL) to $ 2, 450 in the Northeast (ME - VA). Net returns per trip ranged from a low of $ 528 in the Southeast to a high of $ 1, 028 in the Gulf of Mexico (FL -TX). Overall, HMS for-hire charter operations were estimated to generate approximately $ 21 million in total expenditures and $ 34 million in economic output along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim {{of charter}} schools {{is to provide}} equal {{learning}} opportunities for all children, particularly those with disabilities; the results, though, are mixed. Some <b>charter</b> school students <b>fare</b> better than traditional school students, while others do worse. The exception is students with disabilities, where they excel and outperform in the charter school environment. This {{is not the case}} with San Bernardino City Unified School District charter school students with disabilities. Not only do they not outperform their regular education peers, but actually regress in their academic performance...|$|R
50|$|The charter {{approach}} uses market principles {{from the}} private sector, including accountability and consumer choice, to offer new public sector options that remain nonsectarian and non-exclusive. Many people, such as former President Bill Clinton, see charter schools, with their emphasis on autonomy and accountability, as a workable political compromise and an alternative to vouchers. Others, such as former President George W. Bush, see charter schools {{as a way to}} improve schools without antagonizing the teachers' union. Bush made charter schools a major part of his No Child Left Behind Act. Despite these endorsements, {{a recent report by the}} AFT has shown <b>charter</b> schools not <b>faring</b> as well as public schools on state administered standardized testing, though the report has been heavily criticized by conservatives like William G. Howell of the Brookings Institution. Other charter school opponents have examined the competing claims and suggest that most students in charter schools perform the same or worse than their traditional public school counterparts on standardized tests.|$|R
