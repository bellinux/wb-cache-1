2500|$|The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) in Sudbury, Ontario used 1,000 tonnes {{of heavy}} water {{on loan from}} Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. The {{neutrino}} detector is [...] underground in a mine, to shield it from muons produced by cosmic rays. SNO was built {{to answer the question}} of whether or not electron-type neutrinos produced by fusion in the Sun (the only type the Sun should be producing directly, according to theory) might be able to turn into other types of neutrinos on the way to Earth. SNO detects the Cherenkov radiation in the water from high-energy electrons produced from electron-type neutrinos as they undergo charged current (CC) interactions with neutrons in deuterium, turning them into protons and electrons (however, only the electrons are fast enough to produce Cherenkov radiation for detection). SNO also detects neutrino↔electron scattering (ES) events, where the neutrino transfers energy to the electron, which then proceeds to generate Cherenkov radiation distinguishable from that produced by CC events. The first of these two reactions is produced only by electron-type neutrinos, while the second can be caused by all of the neutrino flavors. The use of deuterium is critical to the SNO function, because all three [...] "flavours" [...] (types) of neutrinos may be detected in a third type of reaction as well, neutrino-disintegration, in which a neutrino of any type (electron, muon, or tau) scatters from a deuterium nucleus (deuteron), transferring enough energy to break up the loosely bound deuteron into a free neutron and proton via a neutral current (NC) interaction. This event is detected when the free neutron is absorbed by 35Cl− present from NaCl deliberately dissolved in the heavy water, causing emission of characteristic <b>capture</b> <b>gamma</b> rays. Thus, in this experiment, heavy water not only provides the transparent medium necessary to produce and visualize Cherenkov radiation, but it also provides deuterium to detect exotic mu type (μ) and tau (τ) neutrinos, as well as a non-absorbent moderator medium to preserve free neutrons from this reaction, until they can be absorbed by an easily detected neutron-activated isotope.|$|E

In this paper, in order to evaluate the influence of these type of reactions to the values the neutron-gamma Feynman variance-to-mean ratios (neutron, gamma and total), we derive the enhanced Feynman-alpha formulae for separate neutron, gamma detection and total neutron-gamma detections.

50|$|Melanins {{have very}} diverse roles and {{functions}} in various organisms. A form of melanin {{makes up the}} ink used by many cephalopods (see cephalopod ink) as a defense mechanism against predators. Melanins also protect microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, against stresses that involve cell damage such as UV radiation {{from the sun and}} reactive oxygen species. Melanin also protects against damage from high temperatures, chemical stresses (such as heavy metals and oxidizing agents), and biochemical threats (such as host defenses against invading microbes). Therefore, in many pathogenic microbes (for example, in Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus) melanins appear to play important roles in virulence and pathogenicity by protecting the microbe against immune responses of its host. In invertebrates, a major aspect of the innate immune defense system against invading pathogens involves melanin. Within minutes after infection, the microbe is encapsulated within melanin (melanization), and the generation of free radical byproducts during the formation of this capsule is thought to aid in killing them. Some types of fungi, called radiotrophic fungi, appear {{to be able to use}} melanin as a photosynthetic pigment that enables them to <b>capture</b> <b>gamma</b> rays and harness this energy for growth.|$|E

Also, <b>capture</b> <b>gamma</b> rays are the byproduct of neutrons interactions with wall material of radiotherapy rooms. AimIn {{the current study}} an analytical formula was proposed for <b>capture</b> <b>gamma</b> dose calculations in double bend mazes in radiation therapy rooms. Materials and methodsA total of 40 different layouts with double-bend mazes and a 18 MeV photon beam of Varian 2100 Clinac were simulated using MCNPX Monte Carlo (MC) code. Neutron <b>capture</b> <b>gamma</b> ray dose equivalent was calculated by the MC method along the maze and at the maze entrance door of all the simulated rooms. Then, all MC resulted data were fitted to an empirical formula for <b>capture</b> <b>gamma</b> dose calculations. Wu–McGinley analytical formula for <b>capture</b> <b>gamma</b> dose equivalent at the maze entrance door in single-bend mazes was also used for comparison purposes. ResultsFor <b>capture</b> <b>gamma</b> dose equivalents at the maze entrance door, the difference of 2 – 11 % was seen between MC and the derived equation, while the difference of 36 – 87 % was found between MC and the Wu–McGinley methods.

Both neutron and <b>capture</b> <b>gamma</b> dose vary considerably with gantry angle. The ratios of the maximum to the minimum values for neutron and <b>capture</b> <b>gamma</b> dose equivalents were 1. 9 and 1. 4, respectively. On the other hand, comparison of the Monte Carlo calculated mean value over all orientations with Monte Carlo calculated neutron and gamma dose showed that the Wu-McGinley method differed by 5 % and 2 %, respectively. However, for more conservative shielding calculations, factors of 1. 6 and 1. 3 should {{be applied to the}} calculated neutron and <b>capture</b> <b>gamma</b> doses at downward irradiation.

The focal point for this research was the Blanket Test Facility at the MITR and Blanket No. 2, a realistic mockup of the blanket reflector region of a large liquid metal cooled fast breeder reactor. It was found that Ge(Li) detectors can be simultaneously used as both high energy neutron spectrometers and continuous gamma-ray spectrometers. The broadened internal conversion spectral line at 691. 4 KeV has been analyzed for the former purpose, and the Compton recoil continuum has been analyzed and unfolded for the latter. This development makes the Ge(Li) spectrometer an extremely valuable shield analysis tool. The moisture content of the sodium chromate used in the blanket mockup has been confirmed to be less than 0. 1 w/o by prompt activation analysis. Prompt <b>capture</b> and inelastic <b>gamma,</b> and decay gamma spectra emitted by the blanket were also analyzed to perform a neutron balance with mixed results. The inability to resolve U- 238 prompt <b>capture</b> <b>gammas</b> made it necessary to use the low energy Np- 239 decay gammas, with the attendant uncertainties due to large self-shielding corrections. Lack of data on the variation of prompt gamma yield with neutron energy for all blanket constituents also contributed to the uncertainties, which together made it impossible to develop this method to the point where reliable practical application can be recommended.

The main {{idea of the}} concept consists of using 2. 223 MeV gammas (or 1. 201 MeV, DE) originating in the (1) H (n,gamma) D- 2 -reaction instead of using traditional thermal neutron counting. Results of investigations {{presented in this paper}} indicate that gammas from thermal neutron capture reactions preserve the information about the correlation characteristics of thermal (fast) neutrons in the same time scale. Therefore, instead of thermal neutron detectors (or as a complement) one may use traditional and inexpensive gamma detectors, such as Nal, BGO, CdZnTe or any other gamma detector. In this work we used D 8 x 8 cm(2) Nal scintillator to test the concept. Thus, the new approach helps {{to address the problem of}} replacement of He- 3 -counters and problems related to the specific measurements of spent nuclear fuel directly in the spent fuel pool.

40|$|The {{formation}} of elements {{as heavy as}} Th and U and beyond {{is due to the}} rapid neutron-capture process (r-process), which causes the production of highly unstable nuclei near the neutron drip-line and functions via neutron <b>captures,</b> (<b>gamma,</b> n) -photodisintegrations, beta(-) -decays and beta-delayed processes. Neutrino-induced reactions may also play a possible role. Observations of abundances in old (low metallicity) stars indicate that it operates very early in galactic evolution, and is thus related to massive star progenitors forming supernovae and/or neutron stars. The abundances, being in all individual observations identical to solar r-abundances (at least for 4 < 130), indicate a unique process and witness the interplay between nuclear structure far from beta-stability and the appropriate astrophysical environment. In previous studies we pursued a model-independent approach for the r-process as a function of neutron number densities n(n), temperatures T, and durations times tau. The present study follows the expansion of matter with an initial entropy S and an expansion timescales tau (more suited for astrophysical environments), which can also follow the freeze-out of reactions with declining temperatures and densities explicitely. We compare the similarities and differences between the two approaches. Special emphasis is given to constraints on nuclear properties far from stability, resulting from a comparison with solar r-process abundances in either approach. In particular the behavior of shell closures is examined.

ENDF/B-VIII will be built around the Neutron Reaction Standards as well as the 1 H, 16 O, 56 Fe, 235 U, 238 U and 239 Pu evaluations developed as part of the Coordinated International Evaluation Library Organization (CIELO) pilot project. In this contribution, we summarize these improvements as well as the many other improvements to ENDF that have already been made or are scheduled {{to be made in the}} next year. Improvements already included in the ENDF/B-VIII beta releases: • Aggressive use of the flexible and physically correct LRF= 7 resolved resonance format in 12 updated evaluations (35, 37 Cl, 40 Ca, 54, 56, 57 Fe, 63, 65 Cu and 182, 183, 184, 186 W) • Thermal <b>capture</b> <b>gammas</b> from the EGAF project (6, 7 Li, 11 B, 19 F, 23 Na, 27 Al, 28 Si, 35, 37 Cl) • Thermal Scattering Law evaluations from NCSU (α and β phase SiO 2, SiC, lucite, BeO, and polyethylene) and from the CAB-CNL collaboration (heavy and light water) • Many new evaluations in the neutron sublibrary (n, 12, 13 C, 40 Ar, 54, 57, 58 Fe, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 64 Ni, 63, 65 Cu, 73 As, 120 Sn, 236 m 1 Np) Inclusion of Red Cullen's EPICS 2014 library, updating the photo-atomic, electron and atomic-relaxation sublibraries. Many improvements are planned in the next year including new evaluations such as charged particle evaluations translated from LLNL's ECPL. In addition to these major changes, ENDF/B-VIII will be the first official library released simultaneously in the legacy ENDF- 6 and the newly developed Generalized Nuclear Data (GND) formats...|$|R
50|$|The {{basic design}} of EGRET was {{basically}} a chamber filled with a special type of metal, a sensor {{at the bottom of}} the chamber to <b>capture</b> and record <b>gamma</b> rays, and finally a protective covering over the entire instrument. The chamber would manipulate the gamma ray into a way that it could be recorded. The sensor would capture and record the characteristics of the gamma ray. Finally, the protective covering would block out any unwanted energy rays.|$|R
5000|$|The Omega West Reactor (OWR) was an {{experimental}} nuclear reactor located at Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos NM. OMR {{was completed in}} 1956 and primarily used for scientific scale nuclear research until it was fully decommissioned in 1994. It operated 24 hours a day, {{five days a week}} until 1972, when it went to eight hours a day, five days a week operation. The original purpose of the reactor was to collect nuclear material properties in support of the United States nuclear weapons program. Other uses included production of useful medical isotopes. [...] The reactor was capable of producing an external beam of neutrons via beam tubes which extended through the reactor shielding. These were provided for external neutron beam experiments including: neutron radiography, neutron <b>capture</b> studies, <b>gamma</b> ray studies, neutron cross section measurements and neutron activation studies.|$|R
