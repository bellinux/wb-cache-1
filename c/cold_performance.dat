JPTS is a high thermal stability, high altitude fuel, created specifically as fuel for the U-2.

50|$|In 2005, she {{appeared}} in Rituparno Ghosh's award-winning Bengali film Antarmahal where she played the character of Mahamaya, a docile wife to an arrogant zamindar. Her performance in the film was hugely appeciated by film critics. Her Mahamaya is a worthy contender to lead any listing of memorable women characters from Ghosh’s abundant array of some seriously multi-dimensional female protagonists seen on celluloid in recent times. She rekindles memories of her fiery act of Draupadi in B R Chopra’s Mahabharat (1988 TV series) through her blow hot, blow <b>cold</b> <b>performance.</b> The film’s narrator may be the British artist, but hers is the character that drives its most dramatic moments and through whom the audience is warned about the catastrophe in waiting. From a jealous, wasted aging wife in the beginning, she seizes screen presence with her every appearance lacing it with new untapped facets to her personality. To her husband’s employees, she is like an incarnation of the goddess-provider, to Jashomati she is the nurturer and to the voyeuristic exploitative priests she is the ultimate sexual tease. In the zamindar’s ‘antarmahal’ abounding with women resigned to their fates, she is a thinking, living, sexual being, who sets her own agendas and seeks her own pleasures, almost like a man. She herself considered this role as a big challenge as it was inherently contrary to her personality. The film won her the BFJA Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2006. In the same year, {{she appeared}} in Sekhar Das's award-winning Bengali film Krantikaal (2005) where she played the character of Subarna who befriends a terrorist who broke into her house. She appeared in Raj Mukherjee's Bengali film Nagordola (2005) where she portrayed the character of an arrogant and rude woman who gets diagnosed as having throat cancer and realises that life is not like it has conventionally been and gives her full consent to her own unmarried daughter to give birth of her baby and to bring it up. The film was a major hit at box office for its contemporary social issue. Her performance in the film earn her an Anandalok Award nomination in the Best Actress in the Leading Role category in 2006. She acted in the much acclaimed Bengali film Ek Mutho Chabi (2005) produced by herself, where she played the character of an established actress who meets a car accident consequently losing her career.

40|$|The {{complex and}} highly {{non-linear}} phenomena involved during braking are primarily caused by friction materials' characteristics. The final friction materials' characteristics {{are determined by}} their compositions, manufacturing, and the brake's operating conditions. Analytical models of friction materials' behaviour are difficult, even impossible, to obtain for the case of different brakes' operating conditions. That is why, in this paper, all relevant influences on the friction materials' <b>cold</b> <b>performance</b> have been integrated by means of artificial neural networks. The influences of 26 input parameters, defined by the friction materials' composition (18 ingredients), manufacturing (five parameters), and brake's operating conditions (three parameters), have been modelled versus changes of the brake factor C. Based on training and testing of 18 different architectures of neural networks with five learning algorithms, a total of 90 neural models have been investigated. The neural model (13112684 1) trained by the two-layered neural network, with a Bayesian regulation algorithm, was found to reach the best prediction results.

40|$|Palm oil has the {{important}} advantage of productivity {{compared with other}} vegetable oils such as rapeseed oil and soybean oil. However, the <b>cold</b> flow <b>performance</b> of palm oil methyl ester (PME) is poorer than other vegetable-oil-based biodiesel fuels. Previous research by the current authors has shown that ethanol blending into PME improves the <b>cold</b> flow <b>performance</b> and considerably reduces smoke emission. The reduced smoke {{may be expected to}} allow an expansion in the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) limit and lead to reduced oxides of nitrogen (NOx). This paper experimentally analyses the influence of EGR on smoke and NOx emissions with ethanol-blended PME. The results show that the combination of ethanol blending and EGR is effective in reducing NOx and smoke simultaneously without the thermal efficiency deteriorating. The smoke reduction can be attributed to an improved fuel–air mixing by an increased ignition delay owing to the low cetane number of ethanol and by a promoted fuel spray atomization caused by the low boiling point of ethanol. The increase in the oxygen content also leads to lower soot emission. The decrease in local equivalence ratio by ethanol blending was also suggested by the flame observation in which flame with high luminosity, high temperature, and high KL factor shrinks...|$|R
