5|$|Following the Iraqi {{invasion}} of Kuwait in August 1990, No.86 Wing prepared to deploy five C-130s to the Middle East to evacuate 3,000Australian citizens from Saudi Arabia {{in the event}} that Iraq also attacked that country. An operation to fly about 95Australians and New Zealanders directly out of Iraq and Kuwait was also planned, but would have only been conducted as a last resort due to the great dangers involved. These evacuation flights were not required as Iraq did not invade Saudi Arabia, and the Australians in Iraq departed by road. A proposal to deploy some of the Hercules as part of Australia's contribution to the ensuing Gulf War was also rejected in late 1990 as the aircraft had to be held in reserve in case fighting on the Pacific island of Bougainville worsened and required an evacuation operation. After Operation Desert Storm commenced in January 1991, two C-130s were dispatched to the <b>Cocos</b> (<b>Keeling)</b> <b>Islands</b> in the Indian Ocean where they were held at readiness to deploy to Saudi Arabia in case Australian citizens had to be evacuated; these aircraft moved to Singapore on 29 January and returned to Australia in early February. Other Hercules flew supplies for the RAN warships in the region from Australia to Muscat, Oman, from January 1991, and also transported a naval Clearance Diving Team to Muscat late in the month. In 1992, the Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons achieved a grand total of 500,000 accident-free flying hours; Lockheed presented No. 86 Wing with a trophy to commemorate the milestone.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{researches}} {{the coupling}} {{of the ocean}} and atmosphere systems in the eastern Indian Ocean at the key location of <b>Cocos</b> (<b>Keeling)</b> <b>Island,</b> by studying the link between SST’s, atmospheric convection, precipitation patterns, and cyclones. Which known ocean-atmosphere systems influence the climate around <b>Cocos</b> (<b>Keeling)</b> <b>island</b> and which other climate forcing factors are active in this region? The study uses δ 18 O and Sr/Ca isotopes from a continuous coral core (Darwin Long) to reconstruct past SST and δ 18 OSW for the time period 1871 to 2009 AD. Spectral analysis is used to research periodicities of dominant cycles. The data shows that climate variability at <b>Cocos</b> (<b>Keeling)</b> <b>island</b> is mainly influenced by annual seasonal variability. Also the eleven year sunspot cycle is thought to be of major influence at this site. The coupled ocean-atmosphere systems ENSO and IOD seem to be of minor influence in this region, but are possibly expressed during short events. There might also be a PDO signal present in the data records, but this should be studied in further research. Furthermore, there are four very distinct events present in our δ 18 O and Sr/Ca records indicating SST cooling of 2 - 4 °C, occurring around the years 1883, 1910 - 1915, 1946 and 1965 - 1970 AD. The cause of these events are different, but mainly related to minima in solar activity and possible ENSO and/or IOD influences. The 1883 event could be caused by the volcanic eruption of the Krakatoa. Finally, SST’s gradually increase from around 1975 to around 2000 AD. However, a similar shift in influences of different ocean-atmosphere systems found around the Chagos Archipelago due to crossing of a SST threshold value, is not recognized in the <b>Cocos</b> (<b>Keeling)</b> region...|$|R

25|$|During {{the same}} time that the stratigraphic column was being completed, imperialism drove several {{countries}} in the early to mid 19th century to explore distant lands to expand their empires. This gave naturalists the opportunity to collect data on these voyages. In 1831 Captain Robert FitzRoy, given charge of the coastal survey expedition of HMS Beagle, sought a suitable naturalist to examine the land and give geological advice. This fell to Charles Darwin, who had just completed his BA degree and had accompanied Sedgwick on a two-week Welsh mapping expedition after taking his Spring course on geology. Fitzroy gave Darwin Lyell’s Principles of Geology, and Darwin became Lyell's first disciple, inventively theorising on uniformitarian principles about the geological processes he saw, and challenging some of Lyell's ideas. He speculated about the Earth expanding to explain uplift, then on the basis of the idea that ocean areas sank as land was uplifted, theorised that coral atolls grew from fringing coral reefs round sinking volcanic islands. This idea was confirmed when the Beagle surveyed the <b>Cocos</b> (<b>Keeling)</b> <b>Islands,</b> and in 1842 he published his theory on The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs. Darwin's discovery of giant fossils helped to establish his reputation as a geologist, and his theorising about the causes of their extinction led to his theory of evolution by natural selection published in On the Origin of Species in 1859.|$|E

40|$|Much of the {{information}} on killer whales in Australian territorial waters came from incidental sightings that were collated as part of state and Commonwealth wildlife databases, and from a sighting program on Macquarie Island. Other incidental information was sourced from previously unreported sightings from the public, marine charters and fishers. The Southern Ocean Cetacean Ecosystem Program (SOCEP, Dr Debbie Thiele) provided the only sighting data available from systematic cetacean surveys. No dedicated field study on killer whales has ever occurred in Australian waters. To date a total of 933 unpublished and reliable records of killer whales have been collected from most regions of Australia’s territorial waters. The majority of these records were incidental (848), and over 59 % of all records were from Macquarie Island. Other regions where sightings were common included the coastal and continental shelf waters off South Australia, Victoria, south-east Tasmania and in the Australian Antarctic Territory. These records are likely to reflect increased killer whale aggregations in areas where their prey are concentrated and where fishing activities are seasonally active, combined with a disproportionate effort in recording sightings by some programs. No sightings have been recorded in the Australian territories of the <b>Cocos</b> <b>Keeling</b> <b>Island</b> Group and Christmas Island, possibly {{due to the lack}} of survey coverage in these regions. No additional sightings were recorded for the Heard and McDonald Island Group...|$|R

40|$|The {{drifting}} of Australian landmass from Greater India around 136 Ma {{resulted in}} {{large volumes of}} volcanic eruptions in the Indian Ocean and surrounding continental margins. This was followed by later episodes of submarine eruptions. Evidence of this volcanism {{can be seen in}} the form of two exposed islands, Christmas <b>Island</b> and <b>Cocos</b> (<b>Keeling)</b> <b>Island,</b> and numerous submerged seamounts. Christmas Island is dominated by limestones and phosphates with some basalts and basanites. The island experienced three stages of volcanic activity the oldest one in Late Cretaceous followed by later phases in the Eocene and in the Miocene. Four sites were selected for paleomagnetic sampling, three on east and one on west coast. Samples were demagnetised using alternating field progressive demagnetisation with increments up to 70 mT. Characteristic Remanent Magnetisation was determined using PCA to remove low stability component. Fisherian statistical analysis gave two different mean inclinations (Im) of 71 for Waterfall Spring & Dolly Beach and 55 for Winifred & Ethel Beach. The higher Im of the former sites could be due to lightening strikes that disturbed the original magnetic character. These Im were used to constrain the paleo-latitudes of the island using equation tan Im = 2 tan. Steeper inclination gave a paleolatitude of 54 S where as shallower inclination gave 36 S which lies in conformation with the position of island observed in plate reconstruction models at approximately 50 - 65 Ma. 1 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{repeated}} earthquake such as Sumatra earthquake (June 05 2012), Taitung earthquake (June 06 2012) and Honshu earthquake (June 08 2012) {{have brought}} the disastrous impacts on their nation and neighbourhood. Due to the geographical location of Malaysia proximity to Indonesia, only people in high rise buildings feel the tremors. However, with increased seismic activity in the region following a series of major earthquakes in recent years, deformation monitoring is desperately needed to monitor the physical facilities such as dams, bridges, Light Rail Transit (LRT), monorail networks and other major structures. A reliable deformation monitoring procedure and system has to be developed to ensure the displacements of structures are within the safety threshold. Among the available technologies, Global Positioning System (GPS) is increasingly being used for deformation monitoring. GPS sensors are able to provide fully-automated and continuous sub-centimetre displacement detection in real time. Therefore, a newly established GPS Continuous Operating Reference Station (CORS) network called ISKANDARnet was utilised to detect deformation displacement in Iskandar, Johor, Malaysia. In this study, three GPS CORS from ISKANDARnet had been utilised as the object monitoring stations along with four nearby International GNSS Services (IGS) stations (i. e. : NTUS (Singapore), XMIS (Christmas <b>Island,</b> Australia), <b>COCO</b> (<b>Keeling</b> <b>Island,</b> Australia) and PIMO (Quezon City, Philippines)) as the reference monitoring stations. GPS data was downloaded from File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server and processed by the high precision GPS processing software module, called Bernese Processing Engine (BPE). Subsequently, a continuous deformation analysis software system named ConDAS was developed using Matrix Laboratory (MATLAB) programming language to conduct a continuous two-epoch deformation analysis. By implementing the Iteratively Weighted Similarity Transformation (IWST) and final S-Transformation method, ConDAS is able to determine the measured displacement vector is statistically significant. The unstable object stations were identified and the displacement vectors were computed. The fluctuation of deformation displacement was visualised on-screen proportional to the associated time series results. The results obtained from deformation analysis of ISKANDARnet shows no significant displacement and all stations are stable within the threshold over these two years since 2010. Through the research, a robust deformation monitoring procedure and software system was attained which contributes to the current regional deformation studies in Malays...|$|R

40|$|This report summarises the {{findings}} of a review of selected aspects of the 2010 and 2011 regional plans of the 55 Regional Development Australia (RDA) committees. The Indian Ocean territories of Christmas <b>Island</b> and <b>Cocos</b> <b>Keeling</b> <b>Island</b> are also included in the summary, because although they are not part of an RDA, they are aligned with RDA Midwest Gascoyne to achieve regional development outcomes and also prepared a regional plan. According to its National Charter, RDA is a partnership between the Australian, state, territory and local governments to strengthen regional communities. RDA consists of a national network of 55 committees, which work with all levels of government, business and community groups to support the growth and development of all regions in Australia. RDA is administered by the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport. RDA regions are typically made up of several local government areas and vary in size and population. There are 14 RDA regions in NSW, 12 in Queensland, eight in SA, nine in WA, nine in Victoria and the remaining three are the state of Tasmania, the Northern Territory and the ACT. As part of their contractual arrangements with the Australian Government, Regional Development Australia committees are required to prepare and submit regional plans and update them annually. These plans set out the economic, environmental and social vision for the region, articulate the drivers of change, identify strengths, weaknesses and opportunities and list priorities for action. They also describe the region, its attributes, industry and employment base. That is, they provide a social, economic and environmental profile of the region. In 2012, staff from the ABS reviewed the 55 regional plans prepared by the RDA committees. The purposes of this review were to understand the key issues facing RDA committees in urban, rural and remote areas of Australia and how those issues could be supported by data and analysis. This research paper summarises those issues, grouped in the following categories: economy, population, environment, society and infrastructure. A number of RDA committees also identified data gaps and deficiencies. These are discussed in Chapter 7. It {{is important to note that}} this research paper does not summarise the opportunities and aspirations that were also found in the RDA regional plans. Also, the issues identified in this review:cannot be attributed to particular groups of stakeholders, as plans did not generally state whether the issues were raised by the RDA committee, members of the community, government stakeholders or in previous reports about the region; cannot be added up, ranked or compared across regions, as they differ in importance and severity both within and between regions...|$|R
