" Preconference work included a literature review, and discussion of preliminary proposals through face-to-face discussions and Internet-based surveys with people within and outside rheumatology. At the conference, 5 interactive sessions comprising plenary and small-group discussions reflected on the proposals from the viewpoint of previous and ongoing OMERACT work. These considerations were brought together in a final OMERACT presentation seeking consensus agreement for the <b>Filter</b> <b>2.</b> 0 framework. After debate, clarification, and agreed alterations, the final proposal suggested all core sets should contain at least 1 measurement instrument from 3 Core Areas: Death, Life Impact, and Pathophysiological Manifestations, and preferably 1 from the area Resource Use. The process of core set development for a health condition starts by selecting core domains within the areas ("core domain set"). This requires literature searches, involvement (especially of patients), and at least 1 consensus process. Next, developers select at least 1 applicable measurement instrument for each core domain. Applicability refers to the original OMERACT Filter and means that the instrument must be truthful (face, content, and construct validity), discriminative (between situations of interest) and feasible (understandable and with acceptable time and monetary costs).

A structural mechanism for enzyme catalysis and substrate specificity is proposed, {{in which a}} helix dipole and a hydrogen bond triad of Y 216, S 150 and E 15 assist the binding of two D-alanine substrates.

The 2 ̆ 7 molecular <b>filter</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 7 Y 216 -OH prefers the binding of the second D-alanine by hydrogen bond interaction with its α-NH 3 + group while it disfavors D-lactate due to the repulsion of the two electronegative O atoms.

It is assumed that the Kalman filter system is unaware {{of the existence of}} false information and the adversary is trying to maximize the negative effect of the false information on the Kalman <b>filter</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 7 s estimation performance. First, a brief introduction to the Kalman filter is shown in the thesis. We mathematically characterize the false information attack under different conditions. For the adversary, many closed-form results for the optimal attack strategies that maximize the Kalman <b>filter</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 7 s estimation error are theoretically derived.

From the adversary 2 ̆ 7 s point of view, the best attack strategies are obtained under different scenarios, including a single-sensor system with both position and velocity measurements, and a multi-sensor system with position and velocity measurements. Under a constraint on the total power of the injected bias noises, the optimal solutions are solved from two perspectives: trace and determinant of the mean squared error matrix.

The NCF lengths of 58.7 and 58  mm, to obtain transmission wavelength peaks of 1537.5 and 1554.3  nm (for MMI filter 1 and MMI <b>filter</b> <b>2</b> respectively) were calculated with Eq. (1). Fig.  1 b shows the transmission of the constructed MMI filters. To measure the transmission, we used a LED source with emission in a wavelength range from 1465 to 1650  nm, as input signal. The transmission of the MMI filters was estimated by the following method: Initially, three spliced segments of SMF- 28 fibre were mounted in a metal plate to avoid instability in the estimation, and the fibre ends were connected to bare fibre adaptors. In one of the adaptors the LED source was connected and the input signal spectrum was recorded with an OSA at the other connector. Then, the central segment of SMF- 28 fibre was replaced with one of the MMI filters. Likewise, the output signal of the LED source due to the MMI was measured. The transmission of both separately MMI shown in Fig.  1 b was estimated as the measured MMI output signal divided by the measured LED source output signal. As it can be observed, the transmission spectrum of the MMI filter 1 (blue line) exhibits a wavelength peak at ~ 1538.6  nm and for the MMI <b>filter</b> <b>2</b> (red line) a wavelength peak is observed at ~ 1554.3  nm.
