5000|$|In May 2013 a non-peer-reviewed paper {{describing}} [...] "results {{obtained from}} {{evaluations of the}} operation of the E-Cat HT in two test runs" [...] was submitted to the arXiv digital archive. Although the authors of the paper wrote that they were not in control of all of the aspects of the process, they concluded that, even by the most conservative of measurements, the device produced excess heat with a resulting energy density that was at least one order of magnitude, and possibly several, higher than any other <b>conventional</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source.</b> The test was partly funded by the Swedish energy research consortium, Elforsk. Elforsk stated on their website that the results were very remarkable, but that it was highly questionable to speculate whether nuclear transformation had occurred when no access had been provided to the reactants. In a response to the original manuscript archived on arXiv, commentators criticized the testing as not truly independent, described the report as having [...] "characteristics more typically found in pseudo‐scientific texts", and stated that [...] "The authors seem to jump to conclusions fitting pre‐conceived ideas where alternative explanations are possible." [...] Astrophysicist Ethan Siegel commented at ScienceBlogs saying Rossi did not allow the reactants or products to be measured on this occasion. In the previous tests there were not enough [...] and [...] (the only two nickel isotopes which can fuse with hydrogen), at 3.6% and 0.9% respectively, in the reactants to explain the 10% copper output; these isotope levels are typical of natural copper, rather than of fusion by-product. According to Siegel, Rossi also refused to unplug the machine while it was operating despite it being an easy way to surreptitiously power the device. He also added that the supposedly independent testers had to rely on data supplied by Rossi.|$|E

Due to their numerous functionalities, progress in electronics {{and the development of}} wireless applications, microsystems are used {{in a wide range of}} applications. Moreover, they require a large autonomy to ensure reliability and avoid maintenance operations. We focus on energy harvesting to power them by replacing the <b>conventional</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> with an energy harvester. Different sources can be used but one difficulty is to select the most adapted to a specific application and choose the energy harvester architecture to get an efficient system. Method: A decision support to design autonomous microsystems working by harvesting energy is proposed. It aims to support designer's decisions from qualitative representation to physical models. Our multidisciplinary approach is based on the identification, analysis, modelling and minimization of antagonist flows and effects through a system-level model to estimate the energy that can be harvested. Result: The method is illustrated through a validation case dealing with the displacement and deformation measurement of a cantilever beam with an accelerometer. The aim is to choose the energy source and the architecture of the energy harvester to satisfy the requirements.

Since their exploration, the fossil fuels continued as the major <b>conventional</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source.</b> With increasing trend of modernization and industrialization, the world energy demand is also growing at a faster rate. Apart from their indigenous production, majority of developing countries import crude oil to cope up with their increasing energy demand. Thus, a major chunk of their hard earned export earning is spent for purchase of petroleum products. India is also a net energy importer and almost 82 of the country’s export earnings are directly spent for purchase of petroleum products. There had been sharp increase in the consumption pattern of petroleum products in India. The transport and agriculture sectors are the major users of the conventional liquid fuels. Biodiesel has become an alternative fuel because of its environmental benefits and it is obtained from renewable resources. There are four primary methods to make biodiesel: blending, pyrolysis, microemulsion and transesterification. The most commonly used method is the transesterification of triglycerides with alcohol {{in the presence of a}} catalyst. There is a growing interest in using non-edible oils as the feedstock for biodiesel production because it does not compromise the edible oils, which are mainly used for food consumption.

Biomass is abundant but inefficiently utilized. Gasification of biomass is the one of the alternative ways to encounter this problem. This research aims to study the effect of catalyst composition for palm oil waste gasification and to synthesis and characterize the catalyst. Empty Fruit Bunch (EFB), Palm Oil Fiber (POF) and Palm Oil Shell (POS) were initially analyzed by using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). It is found that EFB contain more volatile matter in comparison to POF and POS. The high content of volatile matter makes EFB highly volatile, reactive and very suitable for gas fuel production. It can also be deduced that EFB might produce more hydrogen than POF and POS. The catalysts were prepared via a wet impregnation method. The nickel alumina catalyst with various weight percent of the promoter, Ce or Ca, were synthesised and tested with a sample consisted of 1 : 1 weight percent of catalyst to biomass in the Thermo gravimetric Analysis (TGA).

40|$|Energy from {{fossil fuels}} have become {{dominant}} in the industrialised and industrialising economies of the world. However, fossil fuels are also recognised as heavily polluting and responsible {{for a range of}} modern environmental and health problems. Nuclear power is a similar <b>conventional</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> in that it relies upon depletion of a limited stock resource and is associated with a range of social and environmental problems. However, the alternative energy sources relying upon flow resources, or income, available with today's technology, have been regarded as too expensive to bring into production. This paper explores the full range of options and their environmental impacts. We emphasise energy capital maintenance and avoidance of pollution as key issues. In looking at the environmental impacts of each energy source in turn our aim is to explore the fallacy of the "too costly to implement" argument. We expose a qualitative difference between the energy sources. That is the comparison between largely known local, aesthetic and physical impacts of renewable energy and the unknown, regional and global long term impacts from conventional energy sources.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} resource allocation strategies for a point-to-point wireless communications system with hybrid energy sources consisting of an energy harvester and a <b>conventional</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source.</b> In particular, {{as an incentive}} to promote the use of renewable energy, {{we assume that the}} renewable energy has a lower cost than the conventional energy. Then, by assuming that the non-causal information of the energy arrivals and the channel power gains are available, we minimize the total energy cost of such a system over $N$ fading slots under a proposed outage constraint together with the energy harvesting constraints. The outage constraint requires a minimum fixed number of slots to be reliably decoded, and thus leads to a mixed-integer programming formulation for the optimization problem. This constraint is useful, for example, if an outer code is used to recover all the data bits. Optimal linear time algorithms are obtained for two extreme cases, i. e., the number of outage slot is $ 1 $ or $N- 1 $. For the general case, a lower bound based on the linear programming relaxation, and two suboptimal algorithms are proposed. It is shown that the proposed suboptimal algorithms exhibit only a small gap from the lower bound. We then extend the proposed algorithms to the multi-cycle scenario in which the outage constraint is imposed for each cycle separately. Finally, {{we investigate}} the resource allocation strategies when only causal information on the energy arrivals and only channel statistics is available. It is shown that the greedy energy allocation is optimal for this scenario. Comment: to appear in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communication...|$|E
