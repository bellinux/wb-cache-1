40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the coronary vasomotor response to the <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test</b> within 3 months after heart transplantation. Background. Normal epicardial coronary arteries dilate in response to sympathetic stimulation evoked by the <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test.</b> In transplant recipients, abnormal coronary vasomotion has been described shortly after operation. Methods. Fourteen heart transplant recipients were compared 52 ± 15 days (mean ± SD) after operation with 10 control subjects. All had angiographically normal epicardial coronary arteries. Coronary blood flow velocity was measured with a Doppler catheter placed in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Four segments in each patient were analyzed by quantitative coronary angiography to assess the diameter changes during the <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test</b> and after intracoronary injection of isosorbide dinitrate. Results. Coronary flow velocity increased similarly during the <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test</b> in control subjects and in transplant recipients, from 7. 5 ± 2. 3 to 11. 0 ± 3. 9 cm/s and from 10. 3 ± 3. 2 to 13. 7 ± 4. 8 cm/s (both p < 0. 01). In control subjects, 39 of 40 segments analyzed dilated during the <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test.</b> In transplant recipients, 48 of 56 segments analyzed did not change or constricted. The mean epicardial coronary diameter increased significantly during the <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test</b> in control subjects (+ 13 ± 6 %, p < 0. 001), whereas it did not change significantly in transplant recipients (− 2 ± 9 %, p = NS). In transplant recipients, isosorbide dinitrate elicited coronary vasodilation similar to that in control subjects. Conclusions. These data indicate that in human transplanted denervated hearts, coronary vasodilation in response to sympathetic stimulation by cold exposure is impaired shortly after operation...|$|E
40|$|The {{factors that}} {{determine}} the individual susceptibility to vasovagal syncope [VVS] are largely unknown, including {{the role of}} the autonomic nervous system. We therefore studied common vagal and sympathetic reflexes in 12 patients with WS (mean age 37 [18 - 75] years, 6 men). The Valsalva maneuver and deep breathing were performed to assess vagal responsiveness and mental arithmetic stress; the <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test</b> and isometric handgrip were performed to assess sympathetic responsiveness. Standing up was per-formed to assess the combined responsiveness. With the exception of a subnormal response to deep breathing in one patient, all vagal tests were normal. In contrast, the response to mental stress, the <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test,</b> and isometric handgrip was subnormal in 4 patients, 6 patients, and 4 patients, respectively. The response to standing up was normal in all patients. It is concluded that many patients with WS are characterized by normal vagal responsiveness, but sympathetic hyporesponsiveness. Sympathetic hyporesponsiveness might explain the inadequate vasoconstriction, which plays an important, early role in ws...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} underlying reported analgesic {{effects of}} odors in humans is unclear, although odor hedonics has been implicated. We tested whether odors that are sweet smelling through prior association with tasted sweetness might influence pain by activating the same analgesic mechanisms as sweet tastes. Inhalation of a sweet-smelling odor during a <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test</b> increased tolerance for pain compared with inhalation of pleasant and unpleasant low-sweetness odors and no odor. There {{were no significant}} differences in pain ratings among the odor conditions.

This study characterized coronary vasomotor function in mice with [11 C]acetate micro-PET measurements of nitric-oxide-mediated endothelial flow reserve (EFRNOM) (adrenergic-stress/rest MBF) and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO 2) using salbutamol β 2 -adrenergic-activation.|$|R
30|$|Limited in vivo {{methods are}} {{available}} to investigate ED: 1) invasive catheterization of epicardial coronary arteries with Doppler ultrasound flow response to intracoronary infusion of acetylcholine (ACh) or salbutamol (SB) [3],[4], 2) non-invasive echocardiography measurement of large peripheral arteries with flow-mediated dilation (FMD) response to shear stress [5], and 3) non-invasive myocardial blood flow (MBF) positron emission tomography (PET) sympathetic-stress response to <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>testing</b> (CPT) [6],[7]. Immersion of the hand or foot in ice water for CPT predominantly releases the catecholamine norepinephrine and increases systemic blood pressure and heart rate. The correspondingly higher heart rate[*]×[*]systolic blood pressure product (RPP) is an index of cardiac work correlated to an increase of myocardial oxygen consumption [8].|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{studied the}} effects of sildenafil, a {{phosphodiesterase}} 5 inhibitor, on coronary and peripheral vascular function, platelet activation, and myocardial ischemia. BackgroundNitric oxide vasodilates and inhibits platelet activation by generating cyclic guanosine 5 ′-monophosphate, which is metabolized by phosphodiesterase type 5. MethodsThe effect of oral sildenafil on resting coronary vascular tone, endothelium-dependent and -independent function and platelet activation was measured in 24 patients. An additional 24 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemia during exercise, and 12 control subjects received either 100 mg of sildenafil, 10 mg of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) or placebo during exercise on three separate days in a randomized, double-blind manner. Flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery was measured, and CAD patients underwent treadmill exercise testing. ResultsSildenafil (100 mg) vasodilated epicardial coronary arteries (+ 6. 9 ± 1. 3 %, p < 0. 0001). Coronary epicardial and microvascular responses with acetylcholine and <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>testing</b> improved, with a greater enhancement in patients with CAD and endothelial dysfunction. Verapamil responses were unchanged. Both resting and adenosine diphosphate-stimulated platelet IIb/IIIa receptor activation was inhibited by sildenafil (p < 0. 05). Brachial arteries dilated in response to sildenafil in controls. Peak flow-mediated dilation was similar, but the duration of hyperemia was prolonged after sildenafil administration (p < 0. 001). Compared with placebo, ISDN improved myocardial ischemia during exercise (p < 0. 05), whereas the effect of sildenafil was intermediate between the two. ConclusionsSildenafil dilates epicardial coronary arteries, improves endothelial dysfunction and inhibits platelet activation in patients with CAD. It has an intermediate effect on myocardial ischemia compared with ISDN and placebo...|$|R
40|$|Witnesses to {{and victims}} of {{criminal}} events can face significant stress during such encounters. Stress responding {{consists of a}} multitude of responses (e. g., anxiety, cardiovascular changes, cortisol responding). In the current study, I utilized a physiological stressor (i. e., the <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test)</b> and a facial recognition paradigm {{to examine the relationship}} between cortisol change following stress exposure and memory accuracy. More specifically, I examined whether cortisol levels at specific memory stages (i. e., acquisition and retrieval) predicted stress responding differently. ^ Findings suggested that individual differences in cortisol stress responding to the <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test</b> predicted facial recognition when peak cortisol was at a time of retrieval but not during acquisition. The findings demonstrate that individuals who experienced a stressor but saw a subsequent decline in cortisol from control to the time of retrieval had a higher hit rate in memory for faces than did those in a control group or those who had an increase in cortisol levels from control to retrieval. ^ These findings provide further evidence that researchers must consider individual differences in stress responding when studying the stress and eyewitness memory relationship. Further, these findings suggest the importance of examining multiple markers of stress responding. Finally, the findings emphasize the importance of considering the relationship between cortisol stress responding and eyewitness memory across different memory stages. Such research suggests a greater need for consideration of stress during retrieval in field. ...|$|E
40|$|Low {{back pain}} {{has long been}} {{estimated}} {{to be the most}} prevalent and debilitating source of chronic pain. The present study first reviews the literature addressing the various theories of pain, the physiological and psychological variables important in pain research, and the psychotherapeutic approaches that have been used to date to reduce pain. Thirty-seven hospitalized chronic back pain patients were administered the <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test</b> and a medical pain stimulus procedure which was medically relevant to their back pathology. A card-sort method was utilized in order to assess the coping strategies employed by the patients during these two pain stimulus tasks. These procedures were repeated following treatment. Coping strategies used by patients during the two pain tasks were compared. Results demonstrated that {{there was a significant difference}} in the manner in which patients coped with the two types of pain. Cold-pressor measures of pain threshold and tolerance were not significantly different between pretreatment and post-treatment. These measures were also not positively correlated with treatment outcome. A multiple regression approach demonstrated that particular coping strategies were significantly predictive of treatment outcome. The medical pain stimulus procedure was found to provide more significant pedictor variables than the <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test.</b> At pre-treatment assessment, patients who relied on dramatized coping strategies were less likely to be successful in treatment. Breathing activity and pain acknowledgement were positive coping techniques highly predictive of successful outcome in this study.

40|$|Autonomic {{nervous system}} {{dysfunction}} {{has a major}} role in the blood pressure (BP) decrease associated with orthostatic hypotension and syncope. The clinical picture of Bartter and Gitelman syndromes includes reduced extracellular fluid volume and normotension or hypotension, but no study has explored autonomic nervous system status in patients with hypotensive episodes associated with these diseases. We tested sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system function in 4 patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndromes with chronic hypotension. Each patient underwent a battery of autonomic reflex tests, including BP and heart rate response to orthostatism, Valsalva maneuver, <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test,</b> hand-grip test, and deep breathing. Plasma catecholamines also were measured. BP was monitored during tests by means of continuous noninvasive finger BP recording. Orthostatic hypotension was observed in 1 patient who experienced syncope episodes. Valsalva ratio ranged from 1. 21 to 1. 61. During the <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test,</b> the range of systolic and diastolic BP increases were 8 to 31 and 6 to 24 mm Hg, respectively. During the hand-grip test, systolic and diastolic BP increases ranged from 10 to 39 and 8 to 32 mm Hg, respectively. During hyperventilation, the difference between the highest and lowest heart rates was 12 or more beats/min in all patients. Patients' plasma norepinephrine concentrations increased during standing. Our preliminary results suggest that chronic hypotension in patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndromes is not associated with sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system dysfunction, even when orthostatic hypotension is present. This normal autonomic function suggests that other pathophysiological mechanisms, such as the characteristic vasoconstrictor abnormal cell signaling, may account for hypotension in patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndromes...|$|E

Methods [11 C]acetate PET MBF was performed at rest[*]+[*]salbutamol (SB 0. 2, 1. 0  μg/kg/min) and norepinephrine (NE 3. 2  μg/kg/min) stress to measure an index of MBF response. β-adrenergic specificity of NE was evaluated by pretreatment with α-adrenergic-antagonist phentolamine (PHE), and β 2 -selectivity was assessed using SB. Results Adjusting for changes in heart rate[*]×[*]systolic blood pressure product (RPP), the same stress/rest MBF ratio of 1. 4 was measured using low-dose SB and NE in normal mice (equivalent to human CPT response). The MBF response was correlated with changes in MVO 2 (p[*]=[*] 0. 02). Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) -inhibited mice (Ng-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) pretreatment and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) knockout) were used to assess the EFRNOM, in which the low-dose SB- and NE-stress MBF responses were completely blocked (p[*]=[*] 0. 02). With high-dose SB-stress, the MBF ratio was reduced by 0. 4 following NOS inhibition (p[*]=[*] 0. 03).

40|$|ABSTRACT—Themechanism {{underlying}} reported analgesic {{effects of}} odors in humans is unclear, although odor he-donics has been implicated. We tested whether odors that are sweet smelling through prior association with tasted sweetness might influence pain by activating the same analgesic mechanisms as sweet tastes. Inhalation of a sweet-smelling odor during a <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test</b> increased tolerance for pain compared with inhalation of pleasant and unpleasant low-sweetness odors and no odor. There {{were no significant}} differences in pain ratings among the odor conditions. These results suggest that smelled sweet-ness can produce a naturally occurring conditioned in-crease in pain tolerance. It is popularly believed that odors have the potential to influence human performance, behavior, and mood.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a pleasant and unpleasant ambient odor on the perception of human pain and to test two hypotheses of the role of distraction and attention in pain perception. Method: Sixty healthy men and women experienced experimentally induced pain (<b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test)</b> during exposure to an ambient pleasant odor (lemon), an ambient unpleasant odor (machine oil), or no odor. Participants reported the degree of pain they experienced at 5 -minute intervals for 15 minutes. Results: Individuals exposed to both odors reported significantly greater pain than did those in the control condition at 5 minutes. At 15 minutes, individuals exposed to the unpleasant odor experienced greater pain than did the control group. Conclusion: The results suggest that exposure to odors judged to be pleasant and unpleasant may not lead to pain relief. Rather, their perception is associated with greater pain than is no odor. The implications for attentional theories of pain are discussed, as are avenues for future research...|$|E
40|$|In a {{randomized}} double-blind crossover trial, {{the effect of}} 8 week supplementation with grape and wine polyphenols on functional and structural vascular parameters and autonomic activity was evaluated in 40 essential hypertensive patients treated with diuretic monotherapy.

40|$|Distraction and {{relaxation}} are regularly recommended {{as part of}} Pain Management Programmes, with increasing research highlighting the inclusion of music as part of pain management toolkit. However minimal research has assessed the role of practice effects or familiarity with these techniques when used consistently over time. Passive distraction(participant-selected preferred music) and active distraction (Progressive Muscle Relaxation; PMR) were compared against a no distraction control on the <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test</b> (CPT). Seventy healthy participants completed the CPT with and without distraction at baseline and one week later. Experimental participants practised their distraction strategies daily between trials (7 days), with control participants keeping an activity log. Familiarity with and preference for distractors increased significantly over time, enhancing pain threshold. PMR and music reduced anxiety, enhanced pain tolerance, minimised pain perception and pain ratings. The active distraction of PMR enhanced self-efficacy {{to a greater extent}} than music and also regulated heart rate. Repeated exposure to distraction {{and relaxation}} approaches enhanced optimal arousal and complexity, maximising pain management.

Plasma catecholamines were estimated by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrochemical detection. Cold stimulation induced significant elevations in plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline to reach mean peak levels 61 % and 108 % above their respective basal levels (P less than 0. 05). Systolic blood pressure increased by 23 +/- 6. 5 mmHg (P less than 0. 001), and heart rate increased by 7. 5 +/- 2. 5 beats/min (P less than 0. 001).

40|$|Although humans usually prefer mates that {{resemble}} themselves, mating preferences can vary with context. Stress {{has been shown}} to alter mating preferences in animals, but the effects of stress on human mating preferences are unknown. Here, we investigated whether stress alters men's preference for self-resembling mates. Participants first underwent a <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test</b> (stress induction) or a control procedure. Then, participants viewed either neutral pictures or pictures of erotic female nudes whose facial characteristics were computer-modified to resemble either the participant or another participant, or were not modified, while startle eyeblink responses were elicited by noise probes. Erotic pictures were rated as being pleasant, and reduced startle magnitude compared with neutral pictures. In the control group, startle magnitude was smaller during foreground presentation of photographs of self-resembling female nudes compared with other-resembling female nudes and non-manipulated female nudes, indicating a higher approach motivation to self-resembling mates. In the stress group, startle magnitude was larger during foreground presentation of self-resembling female nudes compared with other-resembling female nudes and non-manipulated female nudes, indicating a higher approach motivation to dissimilar mates.

40|$|Abstract: We {{investigated}} {{changes in}} visual cortex excitability by analyzing {{visual evoked potential}} (VEP) habituation in healthy subjects during tonic pain evoked by the <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test</b> (CPT). We tested VEP amplitude habituation (slope of the linear regression line for N 1 -P 1 amplitude from the 1 st to 6 th block of 100 sweeps) in 19 healthy volunteers during 4 experimental conditions: baseline; no-pain (hand held in warm water, 25 °C); pain (hand held in cold water, 2 - 4 °C); and the after-effects of tonic pain. During baseline and no-pain sessions, VEPs habituated normally across the 6 consecutive blocks (mean slope -. 28 and -. 18 %), whereas during pain and its after-effects they failed to decrease (0 %, and -. 11 %). Tonic pain induced by the CPT abolishes normal VEP habituation {{and the lack of}} habituation persists after the CPT is stopped. Tonic pain probably abolishes VEP habituation by acting on brainstem neural structures which modulate thalamo-cortical activation thereby changing visual cortex excitability. Perspective: This study shows that tonic pain alters visual cortex excitability, a brain region unrelated to pain processing. These changes probably reflect defensive strategies against pain. Extending the study from healthy volunteers to patients with migraine between attacks would offer the opportunity to investigate visual cortical excitability under conditions when baseline habituation is absent. © 2010 American Pain Society...|$|E

The study employed a three-group, repeated measures experimental design with two active control conditions (sham mindfulness and attention control) and an analogue pain induction procedure (<b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test).</b> The sample consisted of 165 university students. Repeated measures analyses found an interaction effect between condition and time for subjective pain intensity and an interaction effect between gender and time for pain tolerance. Trends show that attention control increased pain intensity, whereas mindfulness decreased pain intensity. Females exhibited greater pain tolerance at post-intervention across conditions. Analyses yielded {{no significant differences between}} conditions among dependent variables of pain tolerance, state affect, or state anxiety. A moderate relationship was found between fear of pain and pain tolerance at pre-intervention, but failed to significantly moderate outcome in main analyses.

40|$|A within-patient {{change in}} pain score after {{treatment}} is statistically 'reliable' when it exceeds the smallest detectable difference (SDD). The {{aims of the}} present study were to: (i) determine SDDs for VAS-scores of pain intensity, for sufficiently long test-retest intervals to include most biological fluctuations, (ii) examine whether SDD is invariant to baseline score, and (iii) discuss the value of reliable change (RC) for detecting clinically important difference (CID) or as a possible indicator of successful treatment. SDDs were determined using duplicate data from 118 patients with myogenous Temporomandibular disorders: (1) VAS-scores of pain intensity from the masticatory system in a pre-treatment diary, and (2) VAS-scores of pain intensity from the hand (<b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test).</b> RC was determined in VAS-scores from a pre- and post-treatment questionnaire. The long-term SDD was 49 mm. A regression analysis on duplicate VAS-scores showed that SDD was largely invariant to the baseline level. Because RC (change>SDD) exceeded CID, it might serve as an indicator of successful treatment. However, only 17 % of the patients showed RC after treatment, mainly because the baseline was smaller than SDD in 67 % of the patients thus making detection of any treatment effect impossible. For patients with possible detection (33 %), the frequency of RC was 51 %. If the detection threshold would be avoided by provoking pain in patients with a low baseline, a long-term RC in VAS-scores might occur in about half of all myogenous TMD patients and might then serve as an indicator of cases of treatment success...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Intermittent {{periods of}} {{hypoxemia}} such as during periodic breathing {{are associated with}} hypertension and increased sympathetic activity. In patients with sleep apnea syndrome, hypertension is common. Treating apnea improves hypertension and reduces sympathetic outflow. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the phenomenon and mechanisms of spontaneous periodic breathing in patients with hypertension. METHOD: We examined 43 hypertensive patients with untreated hypertension without left-ventricular dysfunction, heart failure or sleep apnea syndrome. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSA), heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and respiration were continuously recorded at rest and during cold-pressor testing. Oxygen and a CO 2 -enriched gas were used to test central and peripheral chemoreceptors, respectively. Baroreceptor gain was measured using the alpha method. RESULTS: Seven out of 43 patients showed spontaneous periodic breathing while awake. No difference in MSA, HR and BP was seen between patients with and without periodic breathing at rest except the breathing pattern. However, the <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test</b> caused a larger increase of MSA in patients with periodic breathing (203 +/- 62 vs. 62 +/- 8 %, P < 0. 0001 by ANOVA), as well as systolic (46 +/- 6 vs. 25 +/- 3 mmHg, P = 0. 002) and diastolic BP (26 +/- 5 vs. 12 +/- 1 mmHg, P = 0. 004, ANOVA). Baroreceptor gain was markedly higher in patients with periodic breathing. Chemoreceptor sensitivity was comparable. CONCLUSION: Spontaneous periodic breathing is relatively common in patients with hypertension and is associated with greatly enhanced responses to cold-pressor testing. We suggest increased baroreceptor gain and sympathetic outflow as a cause for the oscillatory respiration pattern via barorespiratory coupling...|$|E
40|$|Stress-induced {{analgesia}} is {{a phenomenon}} that has been demonstrated on multiple occasions in humans in laboratory settings (Willer et al., 1981; Jungkunz et al., 1984). Most research on stress-induced analgesia in humans has focused on exercise and athletic-competition produced analgesia. Previous studies in this laboratory have been aimed at discovering what aspects of athletic competition create analgesia. This study is specifically targeted at investigating the cognitive competitive aspects of a sedentary task. This study focuses on the cognitive competitive mindset aspect of competition and questions whether that mindset can create analgesia. Sex-differences in competition are also a large interest of this study. 48 subjects (24 male, 24 female) from the Haverford College community participated {{in one of two}} competitive tasks, a video game or word games. The study is a 2 x 2 mixed factorial design, with sex of subject and day (baseline vs. competition) being the two independent variables.

Pain data, mood scale ratings, physiological data and questionnaire data about the competitive task were then compared to baseline ratings in each subject. The study produced no significant differences in pain rating as a result of competition.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{assessed}} whether exercise {{stress test}} (EST) results {{are related to}} the presence of coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMVD) in patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed that EST is poorly reliable in predicting restenosis after PCI; some studies also showed CMVD in the territory of the treated vessel. METHODS: We studied 29 patients (age 64 ± 6, 23 M) with stable coronary artery disease and isolated stenosis (> 75 %) of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, undergoing successful PCI with stent implantation. EST and assessment of coronary microvascular function were performed 24 h, 3 months and 6 months after PCI. Coronary blood flow (CBF) response to adenosine and to <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test</b> (CPT) was assessed in the LAD coronary artery by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography. RESULTS: Patients with ST-segment depression ≥ 1 mm at EST performed 24 h after PCI (n= 11, 38 %) showed a lower CBF response to adenosine compared to those with negative EST (1. 65 ± 0. 4 vs. 2. 11 ± 0. 4, respectively, p= 0. 003), whereas the difference in CBF response to CPT was not significant (1. 44 ± 0. 4 vs. 1. 64 ± 0. 3, respectively; p= 0. 11). At 3 -month and 6 -month follow-up a positive EST was found in 12 (41 %) and 13 (44 %) patients, respectively; patients with positive EST also had lower CBF response to adenosine compared to those with negative EST (3 months: 1. 69 ± 0. 3 vs. 2. 20 ± 0. 3, respectively; 6 months: 1. 66 ± 0. 2 vs. 2. 32 ± 0. 3, respectively; p< 0. 001 for both).

The relapse group had the lowest pain tolerance, when compared with the no-relapse and control groups. There {{was no significant difference between}} A 118 G or COMT genotypes with pain response. However, across case-groups, individuals with at least one A 1 allele (A 1 +) had a lower pain threshold and lower pain tolerance than those with no A 1 allele (A 1 -). Heroin-dependent subjects (relapse group: 64 %; no-relapse group: 58 %) showed a significantly (p= 0. 003) higher A 2 allele frequency than controls (51 %).

Healthy male subjects with no history of substance use were recruited as the control group (controls). <b>Cold-pressor</b> <b>test</b> was administered to all participants to ascertain both pain threshold and tolerance. All subjects were genotyped for the functional 孯pioid receptor (MOR) A 118 G single nucleotide polymorphism. Preliminary data showed that control subjects have the lowest pain threshold and highest pain tolerance when compared to the relapse and no-relapse groups. It is also shown that individuals with the MOR A allele have a lower pain tolerance than those with the G allele in all groups studied. Furthermore, in the relapse group, GG individuals have a significantly higher pain tolerance than the AA individuals (p< 0. 05). In can be concluded that, firstly, there is an increased pain sensitivity in heroin-dependent subjects (both relapse and no-relapse groups), irrespective of length of abstinence and that heroin-dependence also lowers pain tolerance, a phenomenon also not restored due to abstinence. Secondly, heroin-dependent individuals (both relapse and no-relapse groups) with the MOR G variant have a higher pain tolerance than those with the A allele. This suggests the G allele may be a predictor for heroin-dependence and pain toleranceGriffith Health, School of Medical ScienceNo Full Tex...|$|E

The current study set out to show that visual stimulus awareness {{plays a crucial role}} in ­determining whether vicarious pain primarily activates behavioral defense systems that enhance pain sensitivity and stimulate withdrawal or appetitive systems that attenuate pain sensitivity and stimulate approach. We employed a mixed factorial design with the between-subject factors exposure time (subliminal vs optimal) and vicarious pain (pain vs no pain images), and the within-subject factor session (baseline vs trial) to investigate how visual awareness of vicarious pain images affects subsequent self-pain in the <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test.</b> Self-pain tolerance, intensity and unpleasantness were evaluated in a sample of 77 healthy participants. Results revealed ­significant interactions of exposure time and vicarious pain in all three dependent measures. In the presence of visual awareness (optimal condition), vicarious pain compared to no-pain elicited overall enhanced self-pain sensitivity, indexed by reduced pain tolerance and enhanced ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness. Conversely, in the absence of visual awareness (subliminal condition), vicarious pain evoked decreased self-pain intensity and unpleasantness while pain tolerance remained unaffected. These findings suggest that the activation of defense mechanisms by vicarious pain depends on relatively elaborate cognitive processes, while – strikingly – the appetitive system is activated in highly automatic manner independent from stimulus awareness. Such mechanisms may have evolved to facilitate empathic, protective approach responses toward suffering individuals, ensuring survival of the protective social group.

40|$|Dyspareunia, {{defined as}} {{recurrent}} {{pain in the}} genital/pelvic region during sexual intercourse, {{is one of the}} most common types of female sexual dysfunction, affecting approximately 15 % of women between the ages of 18 and 24. Women with dyspareunia display similar cognitive and emotional styles evidenced in other chronic pain conditions (e. g. hypervigilance for pain information, catastrophization, and negative affect); however, dyspareunia is a unique pain disorder in that it directly involves sexual functioning. This pairing of pain and sex raises the issue of conditioning. Is it possible that because intercourse is painful for women with dyspareunia, the presentation of any sexual stimuli would evoke similarly negative reactions as do pain stimuli (e. g. fear, avoidance, negative affect or decreased sexual responding) ? The primary purpose of this study was investigate the extent to which sexual stimuli might have become conditioned to affect pain perception. We attempted to do this by trying to tease apart the impact of sexual and pain primes on the experience of experimentally-induced pain in women with dyspareunia in comparison to controls. Sixty no-dysfunction control women and 38 women with dyspareunia were randomly assigned to be exposed to pain or sex primes prior to the administration of a <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test</b> assessing pain threshold and tolerance. A secondary aim of the study was to compare sexual function and cognitive-affective variables such as pain catastrophization, somatosensory amplification and overall mental health between women with dyspareunia and non-pain controls. The relationship between pain threshold and tolerance and cognitive-affective variables were also explored. Results indicated that overall, women with dyspareunia had lower pain threshold and tolerance levels than no-dysfunction women; however, there was no effect of priming condition on pain perception, nor any interaction as a function of condition and group. Women with dyspareunia displayed lower levels of sexual function and higher levels of pain catastrophization than controls. For all women, pain tolerance and threshold were related to pain catastrophization. For women with dyspareunia, pain characteristics such as reported sexual pain intensity, distress, and duration were significantly correlated with sexual function and pain catastrophization variables. Results are interpreted to indicate that women with dyspareunia display a general sensory dysregulation and heightened levels of pain-related fear, similar to other chronic pain conditions. Dyspareunia may thus best be conceptualized as a pain disorder that interferes with sexual function. Our findings further highlight that sex and pain may not be one and the same for women with dyspareunia and that current Cognitive Behavioral Therapy protocols are well advised in (1) encouraging women to engage in non-penetrative sexual activity to increase sexual function; and (2) targeting maladaptive cognitions related to pain to help women cope with and ultimately decrease their pain experience...|$|E

40|$|The {{underlying}} mechanisms maintaining long-term pain localised to musculoskeletal {{structures and}} joints are not infrequently unknown. In routine clinical work with such patients insufficient {{attention has been}} paid to phenomena indicating altered excitability of the central nervous system (CNS). In subgroups of patients with pain localised to musculoskeletal structures spread of pain outside the primarily painful area (including referred pain) and sometimes even generalisation of pain in conjunction with signs of altered somatosensory function in painful as well as non-painful areas have been reported, which indicate excitability changes of the CNS. Several mechanisms such as central sensitisation and/or altered function of endogenous systems modulating somatosensory processing could account for increased pain intensity, spread of pain outside the primary pain focus as well as changes in sensibility at examination. The general purpose of the present thesis, studying experimental and clinical pain, was to examine the influence of ongoing or recurrent pain on somatosensory processing from the local pain area, an area of referred pain as well as from a pain-free area. In addition, the potential influence of a temporary increase or decrease in spontaneous pain intensity on somatosensory function was studied as well as the function of an endogenous pain modulatory system, i. e., diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC). Pressure pain sensitivity, low threshold mechanoreceptive function and thermal sensitivity, including thermal pain and suprathreshold heat pain were assessed in the area of experimentally induced referred pain in healthy subjects, in the local pain area and the area of referred pain in patients with subacute/chronic unilateral lateral epicondylalgia (ULE) and in patients with trapezius myalgia (TM) as well as in the area overlying a painful and inflamed joint in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with two different disease durations. To study if patients with TM and patients with RA demonstrated a generalised increased pain sensitivity and to study DNIC-related mechanisms, sornatosensory function was examined at a pain-free site, i. e., the thigh before, during and following heterotopic noxious conditioning stimulation (HNCS) (tourniquet test and <b>cold-pressor</b> <b>test,</b> respectively). No significant difference in sensibility was found at baseline in the local pain area in patients with ULE or in patients with M In the area of referred pain, allodynia to heat was found in patients with ULE, whereas patients with TM exhibited an increased sensitivity to pressure pain compared to contralaterally as well as to the corresponding area in controls in conjunction with a bilaterally decreased sensitivity to light touch compared to controls. Experimentally induced pain in healthy subjects and increased pain intensity in patients with ULE resulted in hypoaesthesia to light touch in the area of referred pain. Allodynia to pressure was found over the joint in both RA groups, in conjunction with hypoaesthesia to light touch and hyperaesthesia to innocuous cold in RA with longer disease duration. At the thigh, allodynia to pressure was found in patients with TM and in RA patients with longer disease duration. During HNCS, the sensitivity to pressure pain decreased in patients with TM and in patients with RA as well as in their respective controls alike. In all study groups, hypoaesthesia to light touch was demonstrated in the area of referred pain during ongoing/stimulus- evoked pain, suggesting altered central processing of somatosensory input from the area of referred pain. The response to HNCS was similar in patients with TM, RA and their respective controls, indicating preserved function of DNIC-related mechanisms. Allodynia to pressure in a painfree area suggests a disorder of some other inhibitory system and/or overactivity in pain facilitatory pathways in patients with TM and in RA patients with longer disease duration. Whether altered central somatosensory processing may indicate a predisposition for further spread of pain is at present unclear. To increase the knowledge about CNS plasticity in pain conditions localised to musculoskeletal structures and joints is an important research task and may improve the diagnostic work-up and treatment for the future. It is unlikely that a continuous main focus on the periphery will be of benefit to the numerous patients suffering from long-term pain...|$|E
