However, phase shifts at the object surface, inaccuracies of the positioning stage, dispersion differences between the arms of the interferometer, reflections from surfaces other than the object surface, and noise in the CCD can lead to a distorted <b>correlogram.</b> While a real <b>correlogram</b> may differ from the result in equation 4, the result clarifies the strong dependence of the <b>correlogram</b> on two parameters: the wavelength and the coherence length of the light source. In interference microscopy using white light, a more complete description of signal generation includes additional parameters related to spatial coherence.|$|E

30|$|Color <b>Correlograms</b> are a {{modification}} of color histograms, which represents the spatial information of the pixel intensities in an image (Talib et al. 2013). <b>Correlograms</b> are a good representation of color information of an image using three dimensional maps. Table with entry (Ck, Cr, d) represents the probability of color Cr located at distance d from color Ck. Autocorrelogram are {{a modification}} of Color <b>Correlograms</b> which captures spatial information and spatial relation between pixels with identical intensity values. Local properties of an image like pixel position, gradient direction is confined to the local scope while global attributes like color distribution have a global effect. Unlike local and global parameters of an image, <b>Correlograms</b> encounter both the local color spatial relationship and global effects of the spatial distribution. <b>Correlograms</b> are extremely insensitive to the large appearance changes, unlike the other local parameters. Thus, they are good color features for intensity based classification and discrimination.|$|R
40|$|We test various {{assumptions}} {{necessary for}} the interpretation of spatial autocorrelation analysis of gene frequency surfaces, using simulations of Wright's isolation-by-distance model with migration or selection superimposed. Increasing neighborhood size enhances spatial autocorrelation, which is reduced again for the largest neighborhood sizes. Spatial <b>correlograms</b> are independent of the mean gene frequency of the surface. Migration affects surfaces and <b>correlograms</b> when immigrant gene frequency differentials are substantial. Multiple directions of migration {{are reflected in the}} <b>correlograms.</b> Selection gradients yield clinal correlograms; other selection patterns are less clearly reflected in their <b>correlograms.</b> Sequential migration from different directions and at different gene frequencies can be disaggregated into component migration vectors by means of principal components analysis. This encourages analysis by such methods of gene frequency surfaces in nature. The empirical results of these findings lend support to the inference structure developed earlier for spatial autocorrelation analysis...|$|R

40|$|Spatial {{patterns}} in cranial traits for modem European populations are compared with patterns described by Sokal et al. (1989) for blood polymorphisms. Spatial {{patterns in}} these variables are described from both one-dimensional and directional autocorrelation <b>correlograms.</b> Manhattan distances computed among onedimensional <b>correlograms</b> are used (1) to cluster variables with similar patterns and (2) {{to test the}} hypothesis that these clusters are to some extent accounted for by the type of variable. The onedimensional <b>correlograms</b> for cranial traits do not show a significant contrast with either red cell antigens or the set of blood polymorphisms that excludes HLA. The only contrast that accounts for any of the cluster structure among one-dimensional <b>correlograms</b> is that between HLA and non-HLA variables. A cluster analysis of the directional <b>correlograms</b> demonstrates that cranial traits reflect patterns comparable to those for blood polymorphisms. This finding implies that patterns in cranial variables can be accounted for by the same, or similar, population processes as those inferred from patterns in blood polymorphisms. The implications of this finding for the likely origin of the northwest-southeast cline seen in some modem blood polymorphisms and modem cranial variables, but not in Neolithic cranial variables, are discussed...|$|R

50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the z-value of {{the positioning}} stage, when the modulation of the interference signal {{for a certain}} pixel is greatest, defines the height value for this pixel. Therefore, the quality {{and shape of the}} <b>correlogram</b> have a major influence on the system’s resolution and accuracy. The most important features of the light source are its wavelength and coherence length. The coherence length determines the width of the <b>correlogram,</b> which relies on the spectral width of the light source, as well as on structural aspects such as the spatial coherence of the light source and the numerical aperture (NA) of the optical system. The following discussion assumes that the dominant contribution to the coherence length is the emission spectrum. In Figure 4, you can see the spectral density function for a Gaussian spectrum, which is, for example, a good approximation for a light emitting diode (LED). The corresponding intensity modulation is shown to be substantial only in the neighborhood of position z0 where the reference and object beams have the same length and superpose coherently. The z-range of the positioning stage in which the envelope of intensity modulation is higher than 1/e of the maximum value determines the <b>correlogram</b> width. This corresponds to the coherence length because the difference of the optical path length is twice the length difference of the reference and measurement arms of the interferometer. The relationship between <b>correlogram</b> width, coherence length and spectral width is calculated for the case of a Gaussian spectrum.|$|E

Unlike the rank-based versions of Lagrange multiplier test statistics considered in Hallin and Puri (1994, J.

40|$|Previous {{authors have}} tried to image seismic {{reflectivity}} by crosscorrelating passive seismic data, and treating the resultant <b>correlograms</b> as active source seismograms. We provide a mathematical framework for working with passive seismic <b>correlograms</b> that is both appropriate for V (x, y, z) media, and arbitrary source location. Under this framework, <b>correlograms</b> can be migrated with an imaging condition that is tuned to image particular events. For example, tuning the imaging condition to the kinematics of the Direct-Direct correlation event allows direct imaging of the seismic sources. Similarly, tuning to the Direct-Ghost correlation event allows imaging of subsurface reflectivity. Numerical results with synthetic data partly verify the effectiveness of crosscorrelation migration, but also suggest worse resolution of the image compared to standard Kirchhoff migration...|$|R
40|$|Geostatistical {{methods have}} been widely used for {{quantitative}} precipitation estimation (QPE) based on the combination of radar and raingauge observations. They are flexible and accurate and allow for radar-raingauge combination in real-time. Even within the area of geostatistical methods, however, a wide range of choices have to be made when planning for a particular application. These choices regard, for example, the actual combination method (e. g., kriging with external drift, cokriging), the kriging neighbourhood (global vs. local), the technique used to estimate the parameters of the geostatical model (e. g., least-squares, maximum-likelihood estimation), and the transformation of the precipitation variable. In addition to these issues, {{there are a number of}} options for modeling spatial dependencies in the precipitation data. <b>Correlograms</b> (variograms) for kriging are customarily one-dimensional, but two- or higher-dimensional correlation maps are also used and are one way of taking spatial anisotropy into account. Furthermore, <b>correlograms</b> can be parametric or nonparametric, they can be obtained from the radar or the raingauge data, and they can be estimated flexibly on a case-by-case basis or with data from a longer period of time. Recently, nonparametric <b>correlograms</b> based on spatially complete radar rainfall fields have been used in combining radar and raingauge data [1]. Here, we compare the estimation of nonparametric <b>correlograms</b> with the estimation of parametric semivariogram models conventionally used in geostatistical applications. We identify and explain a bias of the nonparametric <b>correlograms</b> towards too low ranges, and suggest a correction for this bias. Postprint (published version...|$|R
50|$|Fig. 2 {{illustrates}} a Twyman-Green interferometer {{set up for}} white light scanning of a macroscopic object. Light from the test specimen is mixed with light reflected from the reference mirror to form an interference pattern. Fringes appear in the CCD image only where the optical path lengths differ by {{less than half the}} coherence length of the light source, which is generally on the order of micrometers. The interference signal (<b>correlogram)</b> is recorded and analyzed as either the specimen or reference mirror is scanned.

50|$|In addition, correlograms {{are used}} in the model {{identification}} stage for Box-Jenkins autoregressive moving average time series models. Autocorrelations should be near-zero for randomness; if the analyst does not check for randomness, then the validity of many of the statistical conclusions becomes suspect. The <b>correlogram</b> is an excellent way of checking for such randomness.|$|E

50|$|The {{interference}} occurs {{for white}} light when the path lengths of the measurement beam and the reference beam are nearly matched. By scanning (changing) the measurement beam path length {{relative to the}} reference beam, a <b>correlogram</b> is generated at each pixel. The width of the resulting <b>correlogram</b> is the coherence length, which depends strongly on the spectral width of the light source. A test surface having features of different heights leads to a phase pattern that is mixed with {{the light from the}} flat reference in the CCD image sensor plane. Interference occurs at the CCD pixel if the optical path lengths of the two arms differ less than half the coherence length of the light source. Each pixel of the CCD samples a different spatial position within the image of the test surface. A typical white light <b>correlogram</b> (interference signal) is produced when the length of the reference or measurement arm is scanned by a positioning stage through a path length match. The interference signal of a pixel has maximum modulation when the optical path length of light impinging on the pixel is exactly the same for the reference and the object beams. Therefore, the z-value for the point on the surface imaged by this pixel corresponds to the z-value of the positioning stage when the modulation of the <b>correlogram</b> is greatest. A matrix with the height values of the object surface can be derived by determining the z-values of the positioning stage where the modulation is greatest for every pixel. The vertical uncertainty depends mainly on the roughness of the measured surface. For smooth surfaces, the accuracy of the measurement is limited by the accuracy of the positioning stage. The lateral positions of the height values depend on the corresponding object point that is imaged by the pixel matrix. These lateral coordinates, together with the corresponding vertical coordinates, describe the surface topography of the object.|$|E

40|$|Analysis of {{time series}} often {{involves}} <b>correlograms</b> and partial <b>correlograms</b> as graphical descriptions of temporal dependence. Two methods {{are available for}} computing these statistics: one based on autocorrelations {{and the other on}} scaled autocovariances. For a stationary time series the resulting plots are nearly identical. When it comes to time series exhibiting non-stationary features these methods can lead to very different results. This has two consequences: incorrect inferences can be drawn when confusing these concepts; better discrimination between stationary and non-stationarity is achieved when using autocorrelations instead of, or along with, the autocovariances which are commonly used in statistical software.

50|$|If {{cross-correlation}} is used, {{the result}} is called a cross-correlogram. The <b>correlogram</b> is a commonly used tool for checking randomness in a data set. This randomness is ascertained by computing autocorrelations for data values at varying time lags. If random, such autocorrelations should be near zero for any and all time-lag separations. If non-random, then {{one or more of}} the autocorrelations will be significantly non-zero.|$|E
50|$|The {{envelope}} function - equation 5: {{is described}} by the exponential term of equation 4. The software calculates the envelope from the <b>correlogram</b> data. The principle of the envelope calculation is to remove the cosine term of equation 4. With {{the help of a}} Hilbert transformation the cosine term is changed into a sine term. The envelope is obtained by summing the powers of the cosineand sine-modulated correlograms - equation 6:. Two slightly different algorithms are implemented for the calculation of the envelope maximum. The first algorithm is used to evaluate the envelope of the correlogram; the z-value is derived from the maximum. The second algorithm evaluates the phase in addition. With the automation interface (e.g. macros), either of the algorithms can be used. The uncertainty of the calculation of the envelope maximum depends on: the coherence length, the sampling step size of the <b>correlogram,</b> deviations of the z-values from desired values (e.g. due to vibrations), the contrast and the roughness of the surface. The best results are obtained with a short coherence length, a small sampling step size, good vibration isolation, high contrast and smooth surfaces.|$|E
50|$|Three {{functions}} {{are used in}} geostatistics for describing the spatial or the temporal correlation of observations: these are the <b>correlogram,</b> the covariance and the semivariogram. The last is also more simply called variogram. The sampling variogram, unlike the semivariogram and the variogram, shows where a significant degree of spatial dependence in the sample space or sampling unit dissipates into randomness when the variance terms of a temporally or in-situ ordered set are plotted against the variance of the set and the lower limits of its 99% and 95% confidence ranges.|$|E
