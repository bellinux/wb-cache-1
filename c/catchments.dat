40|$|<b>Catchment</b> {{management}} {{issues are}} characterised by multiple stakeholders and multiple goals which cut across traditional {{as well as}} administrative boundaries. Although, local government has the extensive local knowledge and experience in <b>catchment</b> management, an integrated management approach is required as different institutions and individuals {{need to work together}} towards sustainable <b>catchment</b> outcomes. There are basically two approaches for <b>catchment</b> management: Total <b>Catchment</b> Management (TCM) and Integrated <b>Catchment</b> Management (ICM). In Australia, ICM principle is normally followed for <b>catchment</b> management. Spatial information {{is one of the most}} critical elements underpinning decision-making for many disciplines and particularly for <b>catchment</b> decisions. As different organisations under different jurisdictions are working towards the management of a <b>catchment,</b> a key problem is the integration of different spatial data having different scale, content and format for multi-stakeholders spatial decision making process. Developing Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) facilitates the exchange and sharing of spatial data between stakeholders. SDI is a portal where each stakeholder can access use and exchange spatial data for social, economic and environmental wellbeing. Australia is recognised internationally as a leader in SDI development and spatial information management. However, current SDI initiatives focus on SDI development at different political/administrative hierarchies which does not necessarily fit with the <b>catchment</b> management arrangements so there is a need to build SDI with a particular understanding of the <b>catchment</b> management prospective. This paper discusses SDI and its importance to <b>catchment</b> management. It explores the theoretical background for SDI design and development from <b>catchment</b> management perspectives. Four SDI hierarchies are investigated from farm enterprises, sub <b>catchment,</b> <b>catchment</b> and basin level. The farm enterprise level activities influence the global issues like climate change, sustainable development, environmental protection etc. through building SDI has been discussed. The <b>catchment</b> SDI research area is identified and the institutional environment including the spatial data requirements for integrated <b>catchment</b> management for building SDI is explored taking the case of Condamine <b>Catchment</b> in Southern Queensland, Australia. It concludes that building SDI differently, with a particular understanding of the <b>catchment</b> management perspective, will improve natural resources management including many <b>catchment</b> decisions...|$|R

5|$|The River Board Act of 1950 {{sought to}} replace the Catchment Boards with larger organisations, and from 1950 the East Sussex River Board took over the {{responsibilities}} {{of most of the}} <b>catchments</b> in East Sussex, but the Rother and Jury's Gut Catchment Board became part of the Kent River Board. Further changes followed the Water Resources Act 1963, and responsibility passed to the Kent and Sussex River Authorities in 1964. Ten years later, these structures were replaced by unitary authorities, who had responsibility for the supply of drinking water and for the drainage function of rivers. This lasted until the passing of the Water Act 1989, which split apart the two functions, and management of the river became the responsibility of the National Rivers Authority, Southern Region. Finally in April 1996, the National Rivers Authority was abolished with the formation of the Environment Agency. The agency has responsibility for drainage and water quality, {{and in the case of}} some rivers, it holds the navigation rights. The Rother is unusual, in that while it is under the jurisdiction of the Environment Agency, it is a free river, and so a licence is not required to use it. The Environment Agency also acts as the harbour authority for Rye Harbour, another unique situation, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs acts as a signatory to the Harbour of Rye Bylaws.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study {{investigated}} drainage and shallow groundwater {{change in a}} headwater <b>catchment</b> of the Liverpool Plains in north-western New SouthWales. A <b>catchment</b> model, SWAT (Soil andWater Assessment Tool), was used to explore rain-fed drainage to shallow groundwater {{and its relationship to}} land use. Drainagewas predicted along with the prediction of runoff on a <b>catchment</b> and land-use basis over a simulation period of 44 years. Predicted drainage in the <b>catchment</b> was 8 mm/year for the 44 years, which essentially matched estimates derived from bore data observed in the <b>catchment</b> over a 22 -year period. These estimates of drainage are much lower than published estimates based on scaling up to the <b>catchment</b> using estimates of drainage derived from point-scale models for different land uses. Estimates of drainage for the different land uses, derived from the <b>catchment</b> model, were also generally lower than simulated drainages from other studies in the area using point-scale models. The investigation demonstrates a place for catchment-based modelling for estimating drainage at the <b>catchment</b> scale. This is mainly because observed <b>catchment</b> runoff is used as an error controller in <b>catchment</b> recharge modelling, whereas scaled-up point-scale modelling generally does not use observed <b>catchment</b> runoff to derive the <b>catchment</b> drainage. Modelling on the Liverpool Plains <b>catchment</b> also suggests that some of the drainage entering the vadose zone and groundwater is later lost via evapotranspiration, a process not generally simulated in crop models, and requiring further investigation to improve understanding of recharge processes and accuracy of modelling...|$|R
40|$|<b>Catchment</b> {{is one way}} to {{overcome}} the problem of flooding, particularly in rapidly growing urban areas. The main aim of the design of a <b>catchment</b> area is for collecting water that falls to earth as rain, and make sure all of water will flow from the <b>catchment</b> area into the same outlet. <b>Catchment</b> outlet is the main stream where it flows into the river or the place where it empties into the lake, estuary, wetland, or ocean. The objectives of this study are to examine the physical characteristics of a <b>catchment</b> and to identify patterns of rainfall in the state using the physical characteristics of the <b>catchment.</b> This <b>catchment</b> study involves two physical characteristics of <b>catchment</b> namely area and average rainfall in each <b>catchment</b> area. The data required for this study was obtained from the Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID) Pahang. In addition, data on rainfall and <b>catchment</b> area were also obtained through Graphic Information System (GIS). With annual rainfall data, the average monthly rainfall for each <b>catchment</b> area can be analyzed. At the end of the study, the physical characteristics appropriate to the selected <b>catchment</b> areas in Pahang will be identified. In addition, this study can verify the functionality of the existing <b>catchment</b> areas in the state that can be used as the initial planning to the relevant authorities such as Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID) or government to prevent the occurrence of unwanted disaster...|$|R

25|$|The {{search for}} new {{supplies}} of water led engineers {{at the turn of}} the century to exploit the open expanses of the Upper Rock, where <b>catchments</b> were constructed by clearing vegetation and sealing fissures with cement or grout. This formed smooth expanses of rock, serving as runoff areas that could direct water into channels. Such <b>catchments</b> were primarily used by the military to provide water to the otherwise hard-to-supply batteries and outposts that existed in numerous places around the Upper Rock. In 1903, the city's Chief Engineer came up with a plan to apply the same principle on a massive scale on the Great Gibraltar Sand Dune along the precipitous east side of the Rock in the Sandy Bay area. The 10 acre slope, which has an incline of 35°, was covered with corrugated iron sheets attached to a timber framework. It used an average of 2,400 sheets per acre.|$|E
