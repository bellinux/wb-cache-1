5|$|The {{choice of}} de <b>Castries</b> {{as the local}} {{commander}} at Điện Biên Phủ was, in retrospect, a bad one. Navarre had picked de <b>Castries,</b> a cavalryman in the 18th-century tradition, because Navarre envisioned Điện Biên Phủ as a mobile battle. Điện Biên Phủ required someone adept at World War I-style trench warfare, something for which de <b>Castries</b> was not suited.|$|E

5|$|Following a long {{fight against}} cancer, {{spending}} {{most of the last}} year of his life in and out of hospital, Odlum died on 28 September 2003 in Tapion Hospital, <b>Castries,</b> aged 69. The body lay in state on 5 October, where it was viewed by Pearlette Louisy, Kenny Anthony, and members of the Cabinet. Odlum's funeral was held on 6 October, with a 30-vehicle procession travelling from Vieux Fort to Castries; it was led by a pair of police outriders and a coach carrying the coffin, draped in the national flag. St Lucian citizens were reported to be openly weeping at Odlum's death. The funeral itself was held in a park, due to no church in <b>Castries</b> being large enough to hold the number of mourners. During the service, sections of his most famous speeches were broadcast from loudspeakers. James Fletcher, a Cabinet Secretary, had previously announced that all flags would be flown at half-mast for the day as a tribute.|$|E
5|$|As a {{tropical}} wave, Claudette dropped torrential rainfall and brought strong winds {{to the island}} of Saint Lucia. The George F. L. Charles Airport in <b>Castries</b> reported a wind gust of , while {{other parts of the}} island experienced nearly horizontal rainfall from the gusts. On the northern and eastern portions of the island, the strong winds ripped off roofs and downed trees across roadways. Overall, damage was light, and amounted to $1.1million (2003USD, $ USD).|$|E
5|$|The {{many letters}} in the novel written by Lambert are also based on Balzac's life. After {{finishing}} {{the first version of}} the book, Balzac tried to win the heart of the Marquise de <b>Castries</b> by sending her a fragmented love letter from the book. Lambert's letters to his uncle about life in Paris from 1817 to 1820, meanwhile, mirror Balzac's own sentiments while attending the Sorbonne at the same time.|$|E
5|$|George William Odlum (24 June 1934 – 28 September 2003) was a Saint Lucian left-wing {{politician}} {{who served as}} Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Born in <b>Castries,</b> Odlum studied at Bristol University and Oxford University in the United Kingdom before returning to Saint Lucia as Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Trade. After working for the Commonwealth Secretariat and the West Indies Associated States, he formed the Saint Lucia Forum, a left-wing pressure group. This group merged with the Saint Lucia Labour Party {{in time for the}} 1974 elections; although the Party did not win, the progress they made allowed them to take power in 1979, with Odlum as Deputy Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|Odlum {{was born}} on 24 June 1934 in <b>Castries,</b> {{the son of a}} barber. He studied {{economics}} at Bristol University, becoming the first Afro-Caribbean head of the University of Bristol Union before moving to Magdalen College, Oxford in 1959, where he studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics {{and was one of the}} few Afro-Caribbean students to attend. At university, Odlum acted, played both football and cricket, and became noted as a successful debater. After graduating from Oxford he returned to St Lucia in 1961, becoming a Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Trade. He moved back to the United Kingdom in 1964 to work as an economist in the Commonwealth Secretariat, leaving 3 years later. Returning to St Lucia again, he became Executive Secretary to the Council of Ministers of the West Indies Associated States.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of August 16, 12hours before the storm arrived in St. Lucia, power outages began {{in some of the}} island's neighborhoods. The night saw heavy rains, 1.58in (40mm) at St. Lucia's Hewanorra International Airport, and intense {{thunderstorms}} and by morning hurricane force winds peaked at 90mph (145km/h). The winds uprooted trees, downed electricity poles, disabled bridges, triggered landslides, and damaged several roofs. Saint Lucia's capital, <b>Castries,</b> was flooded by the storm surge which left boulders and fishing boats on the streets. One person drowned in Sarrot after being swept away by a rain-swollen river while trying to recover a cow. Hurricane Dean damaged the roofs of two of the island's hospitals, but no one was injured. Several other buildings were damaged, mostly on the island's northern coast which was most exposed to the hurricane. The Ministry of Education reported that 11 schools had sustained a combined total of EC$300,000 of damage, and nationwide damage to housing and buildings totaled EC$800,000. The Ministry of Communications, Works, Transport, and Public Utilities reported that most of the country's major infrastructure remained functional, and no long-term disruptions occurred.|$|E

25|$|Lapérouse was {{appointed}} in 1785 by Louis XVI {{and by the}} Secretary of State of the Navy, the Marquis de <b>Castries,</b> to lead an expedition around the world. Many countries were initiating voyages of scientific explorations.|$|E
25|$|The next {{visit to}} the River Derwent was by the Frenchman Marion du Fresne who arrived in 1773 with the ships Mascarin and <b>Castries.</b> As French and British rivalries grew {{towards the end of}} the 18th century, both nations sent regular {{scientific}} missions to the region.|$|E
25|$|Raised in Germany in 1792, at Trier, and {{commanded}} by marshals de Broglie and de <b>Castries,</b> {{under the aegis}} of Louis XVI's brothers, the comte de Provence and duc d'Artois. 10,000 strong, it returned to France beside the army of Brunswick and was dismissed on 24 November 1792, two months after the French victory at Valmy.|$|E
25|$|Nivkh lands {{extended}} {{along the}} northern coast of Manchuria from the Russian fortress at Tugur Bay eastward {{to the mouth of}} the Amur River at Nikolayevsk, then south through the Strait of Tartary as far as De <b>Castries</b> Bay.

25|$|Born in Bury, Lancashire, O'Shaughnessy was {{selected}} for the England Young Cricketers tour of the West Indies in 1979–80, playing in all three Youth Tests. He was successful with the bat, hitting 130 from number eight in the second match at <b>Castries</b> and then, higher up the order, 81 and 93 in the third game at Bridgetown. He was also {{to play for the}} Young Cricketers against their Indian counterparts in 1981, but with less success.|$|E
25|$|Bristol {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut in February 1967, playing against Trinidad and Tobago during the 1966–67 Shell Shield season. The following month, {{in a friendly}} against the Leeward Islands, he scored 86 runs opening the batting with Henry Elwin, making {{what was to be}} his highest first-class score. In March 1968, Bristol was appointed captain of the Windwards for a one-off match against the touring English team, played at his home ground (Victoria Park, <b>Castries).</b> He was the first Saint Lucian to captain the team, but did not play again at first-class level.|$|E
25|$|The final fall {{took two}} days, May 6 and 7, {{during which the}} French fought on but were {{eventually}} overrun by a huge frontal assault. General Cogny, based in Hanoi, ordered General de <b>Castries,</b> who was commanding the outpost, to cease fire at 5:30pm and to destroy all materiél (weapons, transmissions, etc.) to deny their use to the enemy. A formal order was given to not use the white flag so that the action {{would be considered a}} ceasefire instead of a surrender. Much of the fighting ended on May 7; however, the ceasefire was not respected on Isabelle, the isolated southern position, where the battle lasted until May 8, 1:00am.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} the French units {{involved}} in Mouette {{would go on to}} serve at Dien Bien Phu, particularly the 1st Parachute Chasseur Regiment and the 13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade. Both de <b>Castries</b> and Gilles would also serve there, the former commanding the troops on the ground following the initial occupation by paratroopers under the latter. Viet-Minh Division 320 did not serve at Dien Bien Phu, and instead continued to operate in the Delta, occupying the attention of General Cogny – who command the French troops there – and continually tying down French forces there which could otherwise have served at Dien Bien Phu.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the islands}} have mountainous {{interiors}} surrounded by narrow coastal plains. The exceptions were Anguilla, Antigua, Barbuda, the Cayman Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands (which are all fairly flat), and Trinidad (which has a large mountain range {{in the north and}} a small central mountain range in the interior of the otherwise flat island). The narrow coastal plains as well as historical trade is the main reason why almost all of the major settlements (cities and towns) of the Federation were located on the coast. Chief towns included Kingston, Port of Spain, Bridgetown, Spanish Town, Montego Bay, Mandeville, <b>Castries,</b> Roseau, St. George's, Kingstown, St. John's, and Basseterre.|$|E
25|$|The budget deficit, {{which was}} aggravated by France's {{participation}} in the War of American Independence, led to conflict between the finance minister, Necker, who sought to limit expenditures, and Sartine, who wanted to expand the French Navy even further. Necker accused Sartine of exceeding the budget allocated to the Navy by 20 million livres (approx. US$100 million in 2006). Necker complained sharply to King Louis XVI that this overrun threatened an already almost bankrupt State. Eventually, the king dismissed Sartine on October 14, 1780 and replaced him with the marquis de <b>Castries.</b> Sartine, however, was dismissed with honors: he received a reward of 150,000 livres (approx. US$700,000) for his services and he was granted a 70,000 livres yearly pension.|$|E
25|$|Repayment of the French debt {{remained}} a difficult problem, further exacerbated by Vergennes {{and also by}} Marie Antoinette's prodding Louis XVI to involve France in Great Britain's war with its North American colonies. The queen {{played an important role}} in aiding the American Revolution by securing Austrian and Russian support for France, which resulted in the establishment of a neutral league that stopped Great Britain's attack, and by weighing in decisively for the nomination of Philippe Henri, marquis de Ségur as Minister of War and Charles Eugène Gabriel de La Croix, marquis de <b>Castries</b> as Secretary of the Navy in 1780, who helped George Washington to defeat the British in the American Revolutionary War, which ended in 1783.|$|E
25|$|Mauricette {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut in May 1965, {{playing for the}} Windward Islands against the touring Australians. Later in the year, he played for the Windwards in a friendly fixture against the Leeward Islands, in which he took his maiden first-class wicket (that of Len Harris). He also made {{what was to be}} his highest first-class score, 20 not out from seven in the batting order. In March 1966, during the 1965–66 Shell Shield season, Mauricette played two games for the Combined Islands, against British Guiana and Trinidad and Tobago. The latter match was played at Victoria Park, <b>Castries,</b> his home ground. Mauricette took a single wicket against British Guiana and was wicketless in the other game, which was his last at first-class level.|$|E
25|$|At around 1200UTC on September 1 a {{wind gust}} of 46mph (74km/h) was {{recorded}} on Barbados, {{and around the}} same time a gust of 44mph (71km/h) was observed in Saint Vincent. The storm produced heavy rainfall across the Windward Islands. On Trinidad, heavy precipitation caused mudslides and overflown rivers which destroyed some bridges; moderate winds damaged several buildings on the island. Damage on neighboring Tobago was concentrated on its northern portion, where several mudslides resulted from the rainfall; monetary damage on Tobago was estimated at $250,000 (2007TTD; $40,0002007USD, $ USD). Felix produced gusty winds on Grenada, which downed several power lines and destroyed the roofs of two houses; rough waves also broke several vessels from their anchors. In St. Lucia, winds from the storm damaged the roof of a store in <b>Castries,</b> which collapsed and destroyed 12vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Lê Trọng Tấn {{began to}} {{directly}} involve {{himself in the}} Vietnam War from 1962 when he was chosen as Deputy Commander of the Viet Cong. During two years 1970 and 1971, Lê Trọng Tấn was the special envoy of the Vietnam People's Army at Laos front where he commanded troops in Plain of Jars battlefield. In 1972 he was appointed commander of Vietnam People's Army in the First Battle of Quảng Trị, one year later {{he returned to the}} position of Deputy Chief of the General Staff and held {{at the same time the}} position of commander of the 1st Corps (Quân đoàn 1) and Director of the Military Science Academy. In 1975, Lê Trọng Tấn was commander of the Hue-Da Nang Campaign in March 1975 and second commander (Phó tư lệnh) of the 1975 Spring Offensive. During the last days of the 1975 Spring Offensive, Lê Trọng Tấn was responsible for the east wing of the Vietnam People's Army attacking Saigon. It was the 4th Company of 1st Regiment, 2nd Corps under his command that arrived first at the Independence Palace, the workplace of the President of the South Vietnam, and arrested the president Duong Van Minh coincidentally it was also a unit of the 312th Brigade commanding by Lê Trọng Tấn which was first came to the French headquarters and captured general Christian de <b>Castries</b> marking the end of the Battle of Dien Bien Phu.|$|E
500|$|On 7 May, Giáp {{ordered an}} all-out {{attack against the}} {{remaining}} French units with over 25,000 Viet Minh against fewer than 3,000 garrison troops. At 17:00, de <b>Castries</b> radioed French headquarters in Hanoi and talked with Cogny.|$|E
500|$|De Castries' {{seclusion}} in his bunker, {{combined with}} his superiors' inability to replace him, created a leadership vacuum within the French command. On 24 March, an event took place which {{later became a}} matter of historical debate. The historian Bernard Fall records, based on Langlais' memoirs, that Colonel Langlais and his fellow paratroop commanders, all fully armed, confronted de <b>Castries</b> in his bunker on 24 March. They {{told him he would}} retain the appearance of command, but that Langlais would exercise it. De <b>Castries</b> is said by Fall to have accepted the arrangement without protest, although he did exercise some command functions thereafter. Phillip Davidson stated that the [...] "truth would seem to be that Langlais did take over effective command of Dien Bien Phu, and that <b>Castries</b> became 'commander emeritus' who transmitted messages to Hanoi and offered advice about matters in Dien Bien Phu". Jules Roy, however, makes no mention of this event, and Martin Windrow argues that the [...] "paratrooper putsch" [...] is unlikely to have ever happened. Both historians record that Langlais and Marcel Bigeard were known to be on good terms with their commanding officer.|$|E
500|$|Starting in December, the French, {{under the}} command of Colonel Christian de <b>Castries,</b> began {{transforming}} their anchoring point into a fortress by setting up seven satellite positions. (Each was said to be named after a former mistress of de <b>Castries,</b> although the allegation is probably unfounded, as the eight names begin with letters from the first nine of the alphabet, excluding F.) The fortified headquarters was centrally located, with positions [...] "Huguette" [...] to the west, [...] "Claudine" [...] to the south, and [...] "Dominique" [...] to the northeast. The other positions were [...] "Anne-Marie" [...] to the northwest, [...] "Beatrice" [...] to the northeast, [...] "Gabrielle" [...] to the north, and [...] "Isabelle" [...] to the south, covering the reserve airstrip.|$|E
500|$|During a {{visit to}} France in late 1780, Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse, a captain in the French Navy, first {{proposed}} to Charles Pierre Claret de Fleurieu, the French minister of ports, {{the idea of an}} expedition against the fur trading posts of the Hudson's Bay Company. France's marine minister, the Marquis de <b>Castries,</b> and King Louis XVI approved the plan, and <b>Castries</b> issued La Pérouse secret orders that could override those of any fleet commander La Pérouse served under in the event an opportunity presented itself for such an expedition. [...] The idea was to organize a small fleet in secret and make as rapid as possible a journey north to Hudson Bay from either Newport, Rhode Island or Boston, Massachusetts, the most northerly ports of North America open to French ships.|$|E
500|$|The Comte de Rochambeau {{dispatched}} two messengers {{to deliver}} the news to Paris {{in a move that}} had unusual consequences in French military politics. [...] The Duc de Lauzun and the Comte de Deux-Pontes, both of whom had distinguished themselves in the siege, were sent on separate ships to bring the news. [...] Deux-Pontes was accompanied by a favorite of the French naval minister the Marquis de <b>Castries,</b> the Comte de Charlus, who Lauzun had urged Rochambeau to send in his stead for political reasons. King Louis XVI and his ministers received the news warmly, but <b>Castries</b> and the snubbed Charlus ensured that Lauzun and Rochambeau were denied or delayed in the receipt of rewards for the success. [...] Deux-Ponts was rewarded with the Order of Saint Louis and command of a regiment.|$|E
500|$|Operating under secret {{orders from}} the Marquis de <b>Castries,</b> France's marine minister, La Pérouse sailed from Cap-Français in May 1782, and arrived at the Prince of Wales Fort in early August. [...] That fort and York Factory trading post both {{surrendered}} without a fight, {{although some of the}} furs stored at York were spirited away by a company ship that evaded the French fleet.|$|E
500|$|The French aerial {{resupply}} took {{heavy losses}} from Viet Minh machine guns near the landing strip. On 27 March, the Hanoi air transport commander, Nicot, ordered that all supply deliveries {{be made from}} [...] or higher; losses were expected to remain heavy. De <b>Castries</b> ordered an attack against the Viet Minh machine guns [...] west of Điện Biên Phủ. Remarkably, the attack was a complete success, with 350 Viet Minh soldiers killed and seventeen AA machine guns destroyed (French estimate), while the French lost 20 killed and 97 wounded.|$|E
500|$|The {{invasion}} force left Barbados on 20 June. It comprised Hood's 74-gun flagship , the 74-gun , the frigates [...] and Chichester, and the sloops [...] and [...] The following morning, Emerald and the 18-gun sloop [...] {{had joined}} them. By 11:00, the squadron was anchored in Choc Bay. The troops were landed by 17:00 and {{half an hour}} later the town of <b>Castries</b> was in British hands. In the island's main fortress, Morne-Fortunée, the French troops refused to surrender; the British stormed it at 04:00 on 22 June, and by 04:30 St Lucia was in British hands. Following this easy victory, the British sent a force to Tobago, which capitulated on 1 July.|$|E
500|$|Edwin Carrington, the Secretary-General of the Caribbean Community, {{stated that}} Odlum [...] "served his country, St Lucia, with distinction" [...] and was [...] "charismatic, eloquent and a consummate master of communication, both in {{speaking}} and writing...one of the region's leading and most persistent exponents on the debilitating {{effects of the}} erosion of trade preferences for the region's banana industry on the livelihood of the people". Other tributes came from Ralph Gonsalves, the Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, who described Odlum as [...] "one of the region's finest political orators, who was persuasive, eloquent {{and was able to}} command attention universally, not only in his native capital city <b>Castries</b> but also at the United Nations, in Geneva, Cape Town or in London".|$|E
500|$|The capital, <b>Castries,</b> {{was flooded}} {{by the storm}} surge and high seas {{deposited}} boulders and fishing boats on the streets. One person drowned in Sarrot after being swept away by a rain-swollen river while trying to recover a cow. Flooding was also reported {{in the town of}} Dennery where a number of residents had to be evacuated. Nationwide, damage to housing and buildings totaled EC$800,000. In the worst hit areas of the north, closest to Hurricane Dean's path, at least 15 roofs were blown off. Two small waterfront houses were completely destroyed in the town of Gros Islet. The heavy seas also sunk or damaged several boats and damaged coastal roads, in some places eroding the land itself. [...] Coastal damage was estimated at $700,000.|$|E
500|$|Odlum's {{faction of}} the Labour Party {{did most of the}} work in the election, {{building}} their power base among the banana-producing small farmers, with Odlum leading frequent strikes in an attempt to improve working conditions. His work in the 1974 election, along with his [...] "good looks and charisma", yielded a safe seat in <b>Castries,</b> which he allowed his brother to run for. Odlum instead chose to campaign for a rural seat held by the United Workers Party, which he lost by a small margin. Despite the Labour Party still being in opposition in Saint Lucia, socialism and left-wing politics were on the rise in the Caribbean as a whole and, during his time out of Parliament, Odlum was the public face of socialism in the region.|$|E
500|$|Tropical Storm Debby struck Saint Lucia, {{and wind}} gusts {{on the island}} reached [...] in Vigie. Damage {{throughout}} Debby's path was heaviest on this island, and the storm affected most of Saint Lucia. Debby produced heavy rainfall and thunderstorms over a six-hour period, which caused flooding along rivers and in low-lying areas. High rainfall totals wrecked houses on hillsides, forcing about 150people to evacuate to shelters. Roadways were washed out or covered by landslides, and 10bridges were destroyed or severely damaged. This limited access to villages across the island. Landslides also affected the town of Fond Saint-Jacques. Heavy rains covered Hewanorra International Airport with [...] of silt, and in Anse La Raye, floods reached waist-deep levels. In that town, residents had to be rescued by boat. The storm damaged {{about half of the}} banana plantations on the island. Several towns lost access to their water supplies, which prompted the governments of Martinique and Saint Vincent to provide fresh water to the country. Overall, there were 24injuries and 4deaths across Saint Lucia; all of the deaths were from two landslides. During the storm, nine prisoners escaped the jail in <b>Castries,</b> and there were also reports of looting. In the capital city of <b>Castries,</b> the storm damaged a ward of an evacuated hospital; it had been scheduled for reconstruction, and the effects from Debby provided a new assessment for the rebuilding. Damage on Saint Lucia was estimated at EC$250million ($103million 1994USD). After the storm, WINCROP paid 5,802claims for insured crop damage in the country, totaling EC$7.8million ($3.2million 1994USD). As of 2008, Debby was the largest event in WINCROP's 20-year history of insurance claims for disasters. The Saint Lucia government responded to the damage from Debby by repairing damaged buildings and bridges, diversifying crops, and removing silt from major rivers.|$|E
500|$|De <b>Castries</b> {{ordered a}} counterattack to relieve [...] "Gabrielle". However, Colonel Pierre Langlais, in forming the counterattack, chose {{to rely on}} the 5th Vietnamese Parachute Battalion, which had jumped in the day before and was exhausted. Although some {{elements}} of the counterattack reached [...] "Gabrielle", most were paralyzed by Viet Minh artillery and took heavy losses. At 08:00 the next day, the Algerian battalion fell back, abandoning [...] "Gabrielle" [...] to the Viet Minh. The French lost around 1,000 men defending Gabrielle, and the Viet Minh between 1,000 and 2,000 attacking the strongpoint. The loss of the outpost [...] "Beatrice" [...] and now [...] "Gabrielle", allowed almost pinpoint artillery to be rained down {{for the rest of the}} battle and cut off any air resupply using the airstrip, and this dictated the resulting events.|$|E
