5|$|SAH {{may occur}} {{as a result of}} a head injury or spontaneously, usually from a {{ruptured}} cerebral aneurysm. Risk factors for spontaneous cases included high blood pressure, smoking, family history, alcoholism, and <b>cocaine</b> <b>use.</b> Generally, the diagnosis can be determined by a CT scan of the head if done within six hours. Occasionally a lumbar puncture is also required. After confirmation further tests are usually performed to determine the underlying cause.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} year, the Rockets started poorly, winning only 15 {{of the first}} 33 games amidst {{injuries}} among the star players and off-court controversies {{for the rest of}} the roster, such as Lewis Lloyd and Mitchell Wiggins getting suspended for <b>cocaine</b> <b>use.</b> The team still made the playoffs, and advanced to the second round past favored Clyde Drexler and his Portland Trail Blazers (eventually proving to be their last playoff victory until 1993), before being eliminated by the Seattle SuperSonics in Game 6, a double-overtime classic in which Olajuwon scored 49 points in the losing cause.|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this descriptive research was {{to show that there}} was no significant difference between the maternal attitude towards the unborn child in crack <b>cocaine</b> <b>using</b> and non-crack <b>cocaine</b> <b>using</b> mothers. The population was comprised of a total of 30 subjects, 15 crack cocaine users and 15 non-crack cocaine users, who were patients at Maternity and Infant Health in the Metropolitan Cleveland, Ohio area. The results revealed that there is statistical significance between the attitudes of crack <b>cocaine</b> <b>using</b> and non-crack <b>cocaine</b> <b>using</b> mothers. This statistical significance revealed that pregnant women that abuse crack cocaine during pregnancy have the same attitude towards their unborn child as pregnant women who do not abuse crack cocaine during pregnancy. This study was an attempt to provide a clear understanding about crack cocaine addiction, the effects the addiction has on an unborn child and school age children and how pregnant women feel towards themselves and their unborn baby...|$|R

5|$|Whether {{the drug}} {{has a unique}} effect on dental health has been {{questioned}} by a few academics, who note that the long-term use of several other drugs sometimes causes dental problems. Several academic reviews have contradicted this perspective, affirming meth mouth's status as a discrete condition. In favor of its unique status, these reviews cite the differences between methamphetamine-caused caries and those that occur for other reasons, such as <b>cocaine</b> <b>use,</b> {{as well as the}} scope of the tooth decay found in some long-term methamphetamine users.|$|E
25|$|With {{increased}} <b>cocaine</b> <b>use,</b> {{there has}} been a parallel rise in demand for drug user treatment in Mexico.|$|E

25|$|Most {{women who}} <b>use</b> <b>cocaine</b> while {{pregnant}} <b>use</b> other drugs too; {{one study found}} that 93% of those who <b>use</b> <b>cocaine</b> or opiates also use tobacco, marijuana, or alcohol. When researchers control for use of other drugs, many of the seeming effects of cocaine on head size, birth weight, Apgar scores, and prematurity disappear.|$|R
40|$|The {{anterior}} cingulate cortex (ACC) {{and lateral}} prefrontal (LPFC) cortex are brain regions impor-tant to executive cognitive functions (ECF). We determined ACC and LPFC function in 23 -day abstinent <b>cocaine</b> abusers <b>using</b> positron emission tomography (PET H 2 15 O) during performance of {{a modified version of}} the Stroop Task. Cocaine abusers showed less activation than non-drug-using comparison subjects in the left ACC and the right LPFC and greater activation in the right ACC.

25|$|Though ACS {{is usually}} {{associated}} with coronary thrombosis, {{it can also be}} associated with <b>cocaine</b> <b>use.</b> Cardiac chest pain can also be precipitated by anemia, bradycardias (excessively slow heart rate) or tachycardias (excessively fast heart rate).|$|E
25|$|Intracranial aneurysms {{may result}} from {{diseases}} acquired during life, or from genetic conditions. Lifestyle diseases including hypertension, smoking, excessive alcoholism, and obesity {{are associated with the}} development of brain aneurysms. <b>Cocaine</b> <b>use</b> has also been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.|$|E
25|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} reported that <b>cocaine</b> <b>use</b> causes congenital defects between 15 and 20% of the time; however another large-scale study found no difference in rates of birth anomalies in PCE and non-PCE infants. It has been suggested that some birth defects could be due to cocaine's disruption of blood vessel growth.|$|E
2500|$|Manganism is also {{documented}} in reports of illicit methcathinone manufacturing. This {{is due to}} manganese being a byproduct of methcathinone synthesis if potassium permanganate is used as an oxidiser. Symptoms include apathy, bradykinesia, gait disorder with postural instability, and spastic-hypokinetic dysarthria. Another street drug sometimes contaminated with manganese is the so-called [...] "Bazooka", prepared by free-base methods from <b>cocaine</b> <b>using</b> manganese carbonate.|$|R
40|$|Many links {{exist between}} cocaine abuse and stress. The {{literature}} and laboratory studies in rats {{suggest that this}} could be because stress increases the reinforcing efficacy of <b>cocaine.</b> <b>Using</b> male Long-Evans rats, experiments in this thesis tested effects of footshock on the reinforcing efficacy of <b>cocaine</b> <b>using</b> a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. They also examined effects of footshock on the reinforcing efficacy of a half-maximal dose of cocaine. Finally, they tested the effects of footshock on cocaine self-administration in rats initially resistant to acquisition of cocaine self-administration. Footshock did not increase reinforcing efficacy of cocaine on a PR schedule of reinforcement, nor did it enhance sensitivity to a half-maximal dose of cocaine. Footshock did, however, cause acquisition of cocaine self-administration in acquisition-resistant rats. Therefore, while footshock stress may be capable of sensitizing acquisition-resistant rats to the reinforcing efficacy of cocaine, it does not appear that it significantly increases the reinforcing efficacy of cocaine in rats with a history of cocaine self-administration...|$|R
25|$|Many {{drug users}} {{do not get}} {{prenatal}} care, {{for a variety of}} reasons including that they may not know they are pregnant. Many crack addicts get no medical care at all and have extremely poor diets, and children who live around crack smoking are at risk of inhaling secondary smoke. <b>Cocaine</b> <b>using</b> mothers also have a higher rate of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV and hepatitis.|$|R
25|$|By late 1989, federal {{officials}} had been investigating Barry {{on suspicion of}} illegal drug possession and use; that fall, they prosecuted several of Barry's associates for <b>cocaine</b> <b>use,</b> including Charles Lewis, {{a native of the}} United States Virgin Islands. He was implicated in a drug investigation involving Barry and a room at Washington's Ramada Inn in December 1988.|$|E
25|$|The results {{suggested}} that all four treatment conditions resulted in similar reductions in <b>cocaine</b> <b>use</b> with the IDC + GDC group (TSF) {{more effective than}} the other three groups. One issue with this study is that there was significant attrition of patients, with significantly larger numbers of dropouts from the TSF groups than from the others.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cocaine</b> <b>use</b> by {{pregnant}} mothers may {{directly or}} indirectly contribute to defects {{in the formation of}} the circulatory system and is associated with abnormalities in development of the aorta. Heart malformations can include a missing ventricle and defects with the septum of the heart, and can result in potentially deadly congestive heart failure. Genital malformations occur at a higher-than-normal rate with PCE.|$|E
50|$|Frequent cocaine {{users have}} been shown to have lower than normal {{activity}} in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. When asked to perform certain tasks that rely heavily on activation of this area of the brain, the cocaine users perform worse and have less prefrontal cortex activation than the control subjects. The quantity of <b>cocaine</b> <b>used</b> was found to be inversely proportional to the level of activation.|$|R

40|$|In the UK {{almost one}} million {{individuals}} <b>use</b> <b>cocaine</b> {{on a regular}} basis, implying that dentists are likely to encounter individuals that <b>use</b> <b>cocaine.</b> Regular <b>use</b> of this drug may have several orofacial effects, such as perforation of the nasal septum and palate, gingival lesions and erosion of tooth surfaces. In addition, recent <b>use</b> of <b>cocaine</b> {{increases the risk of}} a medical emergency during dental treatment, especially when epinephrine-containing local anaesthetics or retraction cords are used. Therefore, dental treatment should be postponed for 6 to 24 hours after the <b>use</b> of <b>cocaine...</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1980, Congressman Charlie Wilson is more {{interested}} in partying than legislating, frequently throwing huge galas and staffing his congressional office with young, attractive women.

25|$|In 1996, Adler {{suffered}} a stroke and was briefly comatose after taking a particularly potent speedball‚Äîa cocktail of heroin and <b>cocaine</b> <b>used</b> intravenously‚Äîwhich caused a temporary paralysis of {{the left side of}} his face, resulting in a speech impediment. The following year, he pleaded no contest to disturbing the peace in relation to a domestic violence charge involving a woman with whom he had been living; he was sentenced to four days in jail, three years' probation, and mandatory drug counseling.|$|R
50|$|That is {{a direct}} result of the racial bias in our {{sentencing}} system and our mandatory minimum sentences. For example, crack-cocaine sentences are longer, and crack <b>cocaine</b> is <b>used</b> more by minorities. Powder cocaine sentences are shorter, and powder <b>cocaine</b> is <b>used</b> more by whites. The result is that our prison populations are disproportionately filled with racial minorities. Yet, at the same time, prison building has become a kind of economic development policy for white communities which send lobbyists to Washington.|$|R
5000|$|Under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, drug offenses {{involving}} crack <b>cocaine,</b> primarily <b>used</b> by blacks, were punished 100 {{times more}} severely than those involving powdered <b>cocaine,</b> <b>used</b> primarily by whites. When the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 was signed, it reduced the sentencing disparity to 18 to 1. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas {{stated that the}} number of minorities who are arrested and put in prison is [...] "way out of proportion" [...] to those who actually use drugs. Similarly, ACLU senior legislative counsel Jesselyn McCurdy stated, [...] "the most important thing that we also know is that African Americans are not the majority of users of crack cocaine." [...] He further elaborated, [...] "Although they are the majority of people who are sentenced under the crack cocaine laws ‚Ä¶ European and Hispanics are the majority of users of crack cocaine." ...|$|R
25|$|Tactile {{hallucinations}} are {{the illusion}} of tactile sensory input, simulating various types of pressure to the skin or other organs. One subtype of tactile hallucination, formication, is the sensation of insects crawling underneath the skin and is frequently associated with prolonged <b>cocaine</b> <b>use.</b> However, formication {{may also be the}} result of normal hormonal changes such as menopause, or disorders such as peripheral neuropathy, high fevers, Lyme disease, skin cancer, and more.|$|E
25|$|Fellow economists Christopher Foote and Christopher Goetz {{criticized the}} {{methodology}} in the Donohue-Levitt study, noting {{a lack of}} accommodation for statewide yearly variations such as <b>cocaine</b> <b>use,</b> and recalculating based on incidence of crime per capita; they found no statistically significant results. Levitt and Donohue responded to this by presenting an adjusted data set which took into account these concerns and reported that the data maintained the statistical significance of their initial paper.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, former porn {{director}} Gail Palmer visited Thompson's home in Woody Creek.

A six-person, 11-hour search of Thompson's home turned up various kinds of drugs and a few sticks of dynamite. All charges were dismissed after a pre-trial hearing. Thompson would later describe this experience at length in Kingdom of Fear.|$|E

5000|$|The {{color of}} [...] "crack" [...] cocaine depends upon several factors {{including}} {{the origin of}} the <b>cocaine</b> <b>used,</b> the method of preparation - with ammonia or baking soda - and the presence of impurities, but will generally range from white to a yellowish cream to a light brown. Its texture will also depend on the adulterants, origin and processing of the powdered cocaine, and the method of converting the base. It ranges from a crumbly texture, sometimes extremely oily, to a hard, almost crystalline nature.|$|R
