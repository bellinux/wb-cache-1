2500|$|The F414 {{uses the}} core of the F412 and its full-authority digital engine control (FADEC), {{alongside}} the low-pressure system from the YF120 engine developed for the Advanced Tactical Fighter competition. One of the major differences between the F404 and the F414 is the fan section. The fan of the F414 is larger than that of the F404, but smaller than the fan for the F412. The larger fan section increases airflow mass by 16% and is [...] longer. To keep the engine in the F404's footprint, the afterburner section was shortened by [...] and the combustor shortened by [...] Another change from the F404 {{is the fact that the}} first three stages of the high-pressure compressor are blisks rather than dovetailed blades, saving [...] in weight. Furthermore, the FADEC guided F414 uses a fuel actuated [...] "fueldraulic" [...] system to manipulate the <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> in the afterburner section, which is a system which uses fuel from the aircraft's fuel system as hydraulic fluid, rather than relying on a separate hydraulic system with its associated fluid reservoir ("fueldraulic" [...] systems have become popular in applications such as this, and even in more major systems in some cases).|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{geometric}} design parameters on two dimensional <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzles</b> were investigated at nozzle pressure ratios up to 12 in the static test facility. Forward flight (dry and afterburning power settings), vectored-thrust (afterburning power setting), and reverse-thrust (dry power setting) nozzles were investigated. The nozzles had thrust vector angles from 0 deg to 20. 26 deg, throat aspect ratios of 3. 696 to 7. 612, throat radii from sharp to 2. 738 cm, expansion ratios from 1. 089 to 1. 797, and various sidewall lengths.

Static thrust-vectoring and thrust-reversing performance were also determined. Nonaxisymmetric-nozzle concepts included two-dimensional <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzles,</b> wedge nozzles, and a nozzle with a single external-expansion ramp.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} different laser cutting nozzles, nozzle flows and possibilities to improve nozzle flow. Another goal was to design new nozzle configuration in which laser cutting would succeed with better cutting speed and smaller gas consumption. Nozzles and nozzle flows were studied with various methods. Computational fluid dynamics was used to calculate old, convergent <b>nozzles</b> and new <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzles.</b> Measurement apparatus was used to measure both nozzle types. In cutting tests different materials were cut with new nozzles.

50|$|AJM {{machines}} are usually self-contained bench-top units. First it compresses {{the gas and}} then mixes it with the abrasive in a mixing chamber.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} sound generated by supersonic jets such as those emanating from the exhausts of high-performance military aircraft. Four different nozzles are employed: one convergent <b>nozzle</b> and three <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzles</b> with design Mach numbers of 1. 3, 1. 5 and 1. 65. All four nozzles have been built as laboratory-scale test articles and large-eddy simulations have been applied to jet flows from the C-D nozzle with a design Mach number of 1. 5. They are all studied at their design Mach number and at an underexpanded condition. The <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzles</b> are also studied at an overexpanded condition. CFD and shadowgraph both show that these nozzles produce a shock at the nozzle throat which is present whether the nozzle is operated at design or off-design. Acoustic measurements also show that shock-associated noise is generated even at the design condition.

50|$|VASIMR {{has been}} {{described}} as a <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> for ions and electrons. The propellant (a neutral gas such as argon or xenon) is injected into a hollow cylinder surfaced with electromagnets. On entering the engine, the gas is first heated to a “cold plasma” by a helicon RF antenna (also known as a “coupler”) that bombards the gas with electromagnetic waves, stripping electrons off the propellant atoms and producing a plasma of ions and loose electrons that flow down the engine compartment. By varying the amount of energy dedicated to RF heating and the amount of propellant delivered for plasma generation, VASIMR is capable of generating either low-thrust, high-specific impulse exhaust or relatively high-thrust, low-specific impulse exhaust. The second phase of the engine is a strong electromagnet positioned to compress the ionized plasma in a similar fashion to a <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> that compresses gas in traditional rocket engines.|$|E
50|$|A de Laval nozzle (or <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzle,</b> CD nozzle or con-di nozzle) is a {{tube that}} is pinched in the middle, making a {{carefully}} balanced, asymmetric hourglass shape. It {{is used to}} accelerate a hot, pressurized gas passing through it to a higher supersonic speed in the axial (thrust) direction, by converting the heat energy of the flow into kinetic energy. Because of this, the nozzle is widely used in some types of steam turbines and rocket engine nozzles. It also sees use in supersonic jet engines.|$|E
50|$|A Ludwieg tube is a {{wind tunnel}} that {{produces}} supersonic flow {{for short periods}} of time. A large evacuated dump tank is separated from the downstream end of a <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> by a diaphragm or fast acting valve. The upstream end of the nozzle connects to a long cylindrical tube, whose cross-sectional area is significantly larger than the throat area of the nozzle. Initially, the pressure in the nozzle and tube is high. To start the tunnel, the diaphragm is ruptured, e.g., by piercing it with a suitable cutting device, or opening the valve respectively. As always when a diaphragm ruptures, a shock wave propagates into the low-pressure region (here the dump tank) and an expansion wave propagates into the high-pressure region (here the nozzle and the long tube). As this unsteady expansion propagates through the long tube, it sets up a steady subsonic flow toward the nozzle, which is accelerated by the <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> to a supersonic condition. The flow is steady until the expansion, having been reflected from {{the far end of}} the tube, arrives at the nozzle again. For practical reasons, flow times are about 100 milliseconds for most Ludwieg tubes. For many purposes, this flow duration is sufficient. However, by taking advantage of multiple quasi-static flows between expansion wave reflections, experimentation times of up to 6 seconds can be achieved.|$|E
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that the temperature profiles of jets expanding into a supersonic stream are considerably smaller than the temperature profiles of jets expanding into quiescent air. The effect on the wake of varying afterbody geometry is shown to be small.

Tests were conducted at Mach numbers from 0. 50 to 1. 20, angles of attack from - 5 deg to 9 deg, and at nozzle pressure ratios from jet off (1. 0) to 8. 0.

50|$|The Ye-152-2 was {{returned}} to the Mikoyan factory for conversion to the Ye-152M, fitted with small canard surfaces {{on either side of}} the forward fuselage and an R-15-300 engine fitted with an axisymmetric <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzle,</b> allowing the ejector ring around the rear fuselage to be dispensed with. After initial flight testing the canards were removed leaving the mounting structures behind. Used for further testing of the R-15 engine and Urugan weapon systems, the Ye-152M was retired to the Central Air Force Museum at Monino bearing the erroneous identity Ye-166 and three red stars to signify the world records set by its sister ship, the Ye-152-1.|$|E
50|$|Odin was {{specifically}} designed to power the Sea Dart missile. Unlike the earlier Thor ramjet powering the Bristol Bloodhound missile, Odin {{is an integral part}} of the Sea Dart airframe. A biconic intake at the front of the missile transfers air, via a transfer duct, to the ramjet combustor, which is located towards the rear of the missile. Thrust is provided by the combustion products exiting the engine at high velocity, via a fixed area ratio <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The only significant moving part in the engine is the turbopump. This extracts 'ram' air in the transfer duct to drive an air-turbine, which is connected to the fuel pump. The air exiting the turbine is dumped overboard.|$|E
50|$|When the {{pressure}} ratio across a convergent nozzle exceeds a critical value, the flow chokes, and thus {{the pressure}} of the exhaust exiting the engine exceeds {{the pressure of the}} surrounding air and cannot decrease via the conventional Venturi effect. This reduces the thrust producing efficiency of the nozzle by causing much of the expansion to take place downstream of the nozzle itself. Consequently, rocket engines and jet engines for supersonic flight incorporate a C-D nozzle which permits further expansion against the inside of the nozzle. However, unlike the fixed <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> used on a conventional rocket motor, those on turbojet engines must have heavy and expensive variable geometry to cope with the great variation in nozzle pressure ratio that occurs with speeds from subsonic to over Mn3.|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} program entitled GENENG employs component performance maps to perform analytical, steady state, engine cycle calculations. Through a scaling procedure, {{each of the}} component maps {{can be used to}} represent a family of maps (different design values of pressure ratios, efficiency, weight flow, etc.) Either convergent or <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzles</b> may be used. Included is a complete FORTRAN 4 listing of the program.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{of a large}} but momentary side force during the start-up of rocket motors employing <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzles</b> has been noted occasionally. Asymmetric flow separation within the divergent section of the nozzle is proposed as the principal source of this lateral force. A method for estimating this force and its concomitant lateral impulse is outlined, and results obtained by applying the method to Scout vehicle first-, second-, and third-stage rocket motor start-ups are presented and compared with similar estimates that other researchers obtained by a different method...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} approach {{based on}} the conservative form of the Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, transport equation-based turbulent cavitation models and a pressure-based operator-splitting algorithm is applied to study turbulent cavitating flows through <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The implications of the compressibility effect, reflected via {{the speed of sound}} definition in the two-phase mixture, are assessed with two modeling approaches. Depending on the geometric confinement of the nozzle, compressibility model, and cavitation numbers, auto-oscillations and quasi-steady behaviors are observed. Detailed flow structures and cavitation dynamics are highlighted, and implications of the cavitation model discussed...|$|R
50|$|Choked flow is a fluid dynamic {{condition}} {{associated with the}} Venturi effect. When a flowing fluid at a given pressure and temperature passes through a restriction (such as the throat of a <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> or a valve in a pipe) into a lower pressure environment the fluid velocity increases. At initially subsonic upstream conditions, the conservation of mass principle requires the fluid velocity to increase as it flows through the smaller cross-sectional area of the restriction. At the same time, the Venturi effect causes the static pressure, and therefore the density, to decrease downstream beyond the restriction. Choked flow is a limiting condition where the mass flow will not increase with a further decrease in the downstream pressure environment while upstream pressure is fixed. Note that the limited parameter is velocity, and thus mass flow can be increased with increased upstream pressure (increased fluid density).|$|E
50|$|Ramjets utilize {{high-speed}} {{characteristics of}} air to literally 'ram' air through an inlet diffuser into the combustor. At transonic and supersonic flight speeds, the air upstream of the inlet {{is not able}} {{to move out of the}} way quickly enough, and is compressed within the diffuser before being diffused into the combustor. Combustion in a ramjet takes place at subsonic velocities, similar to turbojets, but the combustion products are then accelerated through a <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> to supersonic speeds. As they have no mechanical means of compression, ramjets cannot start from a standstill, and generally do not achieve sufficient compression until supersonic flight. The lack of intricate turbomachinery allows ramjets to deal with the temperature rise associated with decelerating a supersonic flow to subsonic speeds, but this only goes so far: at near-hypersonic velocities, the temperature rise and inefficiencies discourage decelerating the flow to the magnitude found in ramjet engines.|$|E
50|$|At {{the other}} extreme, some high bypass ratio civil turbofans control the fan working line {{by using a}} <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzle</b> with an {{extremely}} low (less than 1.01) area ratio on the bypass (or mixed exhaust) stream. At low airspeeds, such a setup causes the nozzle {{to act as if}} it had variable geometry by preventing it from choking and allowing it to accelerate and decelerate exhaust gas approaching the throat and divergent section, respectively. Consequently, the nozzle exit area controls the fan match, which, being larger than the throat, pulls the fan working line slightly away from surge. At higher flight speeds, the ram rise in the intake chokes the throat and causes the nozzle's area to dictate the fan match; the nozzle, being smaller than the exit, causes the throat to push the fan working line slightly toward surge. This is not a problem, however, for a fan's surge margin is much greater at high flight speeds.|$|E
40|$|A {{parametric}} {{investigation of}} the static internal performance of multifunction two-dimensional <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{has been made in}} the static test facility of the Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel. All nozzles had a constant throat area and aspect ratio. The effects of upper and lower flap angles, divergent flap length, throat approach angle, sidewall containment, and throat geometry were determined. All nozzles were tested at a thrust vector angle that varied from 5. 60 tp 23. 00 deg. The nozzle pressure ratio was varied up to 10 for all configurations...|$|R
50|$|To {{implement}} TVFC {{a variety}} of nozzles both mechanical and fluidic may be applied. This includes convergent and <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzles</b> that may be fixed or geometrically variable. It also includes variable mechanisms within a fixed nozzle, such as rotating cascades and rotating exit vanes. Within these aircraft nozzles, the geometry itself may vary from two-dimensional (2-D) to axisymmetric or elliptic. The number of nozzles on a given aircraft to achieve TVFC can vary from one on a CTOL aircraft to a minimum of four {{in the case of}} STOVL aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|Plug nozzles {{are used}} in {{aircraft}} typically with jet engines — the Junkers Jumo 004's Zwiebel (onion) movable restrictive body being a pioneering example, providing a form of variable geometry with its exhaust — both because of the annular shape of the turbine exhaust and for their altitude compensating characteristics. For high speed aircraft, translating the plug or external cowl provides a means of area control with relatively simple actuation. Plug nozzles {{have been shown to}} provide noise reduction compared to traditional <b>convergent-divergent</b> <b>nozzles.</b> [...] Weight and cooling are typical concerns with aircraft plug nozzles.|$|R
