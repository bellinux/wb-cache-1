Keith Lowe gave York the lead with a header from Meikle's <b>corner</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 67th minute, before Tranmere {{equalised}} through James Rowe in stoppage {{time as the}} match ended a 1–1 draw. This {{was followed by a}} 1–0 home defeat to Doncaster Rovers {{in the first round of}} the League Cup, after Harry Forrester scored for the League One team in stoppage time. Hyde scored from a Straker corner on his debut to give York the lead over Northampton Town in a home match, before the visitors made the score 1–1 in the 90th minute from a Marc Richards free kick. Cambridge United took a two-goal lead at York, before Hyde scored a header shortly before half time and Wes Fletcher scored a penalty in the 83rd minute, seeing the match end a 2–2 draw. York then played away to Exeter City, who were also without a win this season, and drew 1–1; Exeter took the lead in the eighth minute before Lowe equalised with a header from a Summerfield <b>corner</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 82nd minute. August ended with a fifth successive league draw after York were held 0–0 at home by Wycombe Wanderers, who wad won three of their first four league matches.|$|E
5|$|Coquelin {{then was}} booked for his foul on Oscar, which earned Chelsea a free kick. Oscar's attempt was saved by Čech, who fisted the ball round the post. Chelsea {{continued}} to attack, though Arsenal withstood their pressure. John Terry rose highest from a <b>corner</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 74th minute and headed {{the ball in}} Zouma's direction, which eventually was caught by Čech. Hazard's shot was blocked in the 79th minute and Oscar then spurned a chance, with Falcao unable to create something from it. In {{an effort to find}} an equaliser with ten minutes of normal time remaining, Mourinho brought on Moses in place of Terry and deployed a three-man defence. It nearly presented Arsenal the chance to score their second of the match, but for Cazorla to have his effort blocked and Aaron Ramsey on the rebound shooting wide.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} their largest league crowd in three years, United hosted the Los Angeles Galaxy on 9 April.

The match piqued interest across the region, as a crowd of 26,222 turned up for the game, United's largest league match crowd in over three years. The game itself ended in a 1–1 draw, with the Galaxy scoring the first goal, a Mike Magee header off of a David Beckham <b>corner</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12th minute.

A cross from midfielder Stewart Downing was headed out for a Liverpool <b>corner</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 40th minute, but the {{subsequent}} corner is cleared by Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Čech.

However, after the Australians established communications, the shelling was halted and they began their advance. No sooner had the lead elements—D Company under the command of Major Ian Fisher—emerged into the cleared area that was originally to have been used as the battalion's LZ, when the forward platoon came under fire from Viet Cong positions in the tree-line on the north-east <b>corner.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> action which followed, six Australians from 12 Platoon were wounded, including platoon commander Lieutenant Jim Bourke, who was shot through the jaw but remained in command until he passed out from loss of blood.

5|$|Liverpool got {{the first}} half of extra time under way, but the start was slow as players {{suffered}} with cramp, Carragher in particular.

Liverpool won another <b>corner</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 99th minute, which was cleared by West Ham; the ball came back into the penalty area and Morientes headed down for Cissé, but he was unable to control the ball. Before the end of the half, Hyypiä had a chance to score after running past Scaloni and Harewood, but his shot went wide of the West Ham goal.|$|E

Against the Republic of Ireland in the round of 16, he took advantage of Terry Phelan's header intended for goalkeeper Packie Bonner and sprinted away to set up Dennis Bergkamp to score. The Netherlands were eliminated in the quarter-finals against Brazil; Advocaat deployed Overmars as an extra attacker, but for much of the match he played as one of five in midfield. His <b>corner</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 76th minute was met by Aron Winter and levelled the scores at 2–2 for a brief period – a goal from Branco resolved the match in favour of Brazil.

5|$|Chelsea {{were drawn}} to play at home against Birmingham City in the Fifth Round, with Birmingham {{dominating}} the first half through a David Murphy goal. Daniel Sturridge scored {{in the second half}} to force a replay, which was played on 6 March at Birmingham, just two days after André Villas-Boas was relieved of his duties as Chelsea manager. Birmingham held Chelsea throughout the first half, and looked the stronger side at times, but after Mata and Raul Meireles scored twice in five minutes, Chelsea dominated the remainder of the game until the final whistle. In the Sixth Round, Chelsea overcame Leicester City at home in a 5–2 thriller. Gary Cahill scored his first FA Cup goal for Chelsea from a <b>corner</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12th minute, with Salomon Kalou following up five minutes later. In the second half, Fernando Torres ended a goal drought of over 25 hours to score, before Jermaine Beckford gave Leicester a late lifeline.

During the session, where teams assessed their car's thermal management {{in preparation for the}} race, Bird and Piquet locked their tyres and went off into the turn one run-off area, while Abt stopped on the start/finish straight but was able to restart his car. Duval and Frijns spun within moments of each other.

5|$|On July 1, 1919, M-48 {{ran from}} Rexton to Trout Lake and eastward on to Rudyard. The highway {{continued}} to Goetzville {{and ran to}} DeTour Village at the eastern tip of the UP. By 1927, the western end was moved to a point north of Newberry. M-48 was extended along US Highway 2 (US2) to Garnet. From there, M-48 ran north to M-28 east of Newberry. It turned west along M-28 into Newberry and then north to Four Mile <b>Corner.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> mid-1930s, M-28's routing through the Newberry area was shifted. As {{a result of this}} shift, the section of M-28/M-48 in downtown was renumbered M-28A/M-48. In the early 1940s, US2 was moved to a new routing along the Lake Michigan shoreline. In the process, the US2/M-48 concurrency was eliminated. By the same time, M-48 was truncated when M-134 was designated east to the DeTour area. By the end of the decade, M-48 was truncated and rerouted on its western end, replacing the contemporary M-117 south of Rexton to US2 in Epoufette. All of M-48 west of US2 was turned over to local jurisdiction and removed from the state highway system, save a section made part of M-123 in late 1960 or early 1961. A few years later, M-48 was extended along a former section of US2 into Rudyard to connect to the newly opened I-75/US2 freeway in 1963. After October 1970, the former M-48 west of the current highway was designated {{as a part of the}} County-Designated Highway System.|$|E
