5000|$|The Wright etch {{consistently}} produces well-defined etch {{figures of}} common defects on silicon surfaces. This attribute {{is attributed to}} the interactions of the selected chemicals in the formula. Robbins and Schwartz [...] described chemical etching of silicon in detail using an HF, HNO3 and H2O system; and an HF, HNO3, H2O and CH3COOH (acetic acid) system. Briefly, the etching of silicon is a two-step process. First, the top surface of the silicon is converted into a soluble oxide by a suitable oxidizing agent(s). Then the resulting oxide layer {{is removed from the}} surface by dissolution in a suitable solvent, usually HF. This is a continuous process during the etch cycle. In order to delineate a <b>crystal</b> <b>defect,</b> the defect area must be oxidized at a slower or faster rate than the surrounding area thereby forming a mound or pit during the preferential etch process.|$|E

Milling induced disorder has been very well studied in metals and inorganic materials; however, this type of study has rarely been conducted with pharmaceutical organic materials {{due to a lack}} of characterization methods that enable assessment and quantification of <b>crystal</b> <b>defects.</b> Little work has been done to differentiate the two types of disorder, amorphous vs <b>crystal</b> <b>defects.</b> The lack of understanding of the fundamental mechanism of milling induced disorder may cause significant uncertainty and unpredictability on materials’ properties during the development of drug products. Therefore, it is important to differentiate these two types of disorder and understand the impact of <b>crystal</b> <b>defects</b> on material properties and functionality. The present research focuses on the identification and characterization of <b>crystal</b> <b>defects</b> during the milling of organic molecular <b>crystals.</b> The <b>crystal</b> <b>defects</b> were differentiated from amorphous phase by thermal, diffraction, and spectroscopic methods.

However, the self-assembled nature of colloidal crystals invites {{the possibility for}} the formation of intrinsic <b>crystal</b> <b>defects,</b> such as point defects, line defects, and stacking faults, which have profound impacts on the macroscopic properties of materials. The intentional introduction and control of <b>crystal</b> <b>defects</b> are of considerable significance in material science, optical science and nanotechnology.

Based on our simulated designs, decimated photonic crystal lattices have reduced number of holes, which enhance {{the current and}} heat con-ductive paths from the optical cavity with a minimal impact on the cavity quality factor and resonance. Our calculations indicate lower operating temperature using the decimation lattice designs. Two decimated cavity designs are demonstrated and compared to conventional photonic <b>crystal</b> <b>defect</b> cavity lasers in InP-based membranes. The decimated designs show improved laser perfor-mance with a small reduction of measured cavity quality factor.

30|$|Results from {{comparison}} of microstructure development in deformed nc materials {{have shown that}} grain growth behavior was influenced by initial microstructures such as grain orientation, internal stress, and <b>crystal</b> <b>defect</b> density [6, 14 – 16]. Thus, {{it is difficult to}} compare the results of microstructure evolution from other literature. Two or more samples are expected to deform simultaneously under nominally the same deformation condition. Note that accumulative roll bonding is one of the powerful techniques to produce ultra-fine grain microstructures by introducing large strain and strain gradient [17, 18]. Pack rolling has been chosen as the deformation processing route in our previous study. Effects of pack-rolling deformation on the microstructure, texture, and hardness of nc Ni have been primarily explored [19, 20]. It has been revealed that deformed zones with different grain sizes undergo different strains. But nonetheless, little attention is paid to in-depth comparative analysis of microstructural evolution such as the changes in <b>crystal</b> <b>defect</b> density. Therefore, the present study aims to further investigate the microstructural stability of pack-rolled nc Ni.|$|E
