40|$|Reproductive {{decline in}} men is {{characterized}} by the reduction in the testicular androgen and the concomitant increase in gonadotropin secretion. I't been shown that the first event to occur with the advance of age is the deficit in the testis to synthesize and secrete androgen, and what follows is the activation of the hypothalamic-pictuitary unit leading to the hypersecretion of gonadotropin. However, it's not yet clear whether functional change in the hypothalamic-pituitary unit with the advance of age is part of the mechanism where hypergonadotropic hypogonadism is resulted in aging human males. Thus, the authors intended to clarify the role of hypothalamic factors in causing the hypersecretion of serum LH in aging men. Basal serum LH level and its response to exogenous LH-RH tended to increase with aging. In 56. 0 % of the subjects with ages 50 yr or older, basal LH exceeded the mean+ 2 SD (18. 6 mIU/ml) of the subjects younger than 50 yr. In the 22. 8 % of the subjects with ages 50 yr or older, maximal LH response to LH-RH exceeded the mean+ 2 SD (181. 3 mIU/ml) of the subjects younger than 50 yr. In addition, a delayed response of LH to exogenous LH-RH was seen in the subjects with ages 70 yr or older. In the subjects younger than 70 yr, approximately 80 % showed maximal LH response at 30 minutes after LH-RH administration. However, the percentage of the subjects who showed maximal LH response at 30 minutes after LH-RH administration declined to 63. 6 % in the 70 s, and further to 31. 3 % in the 80 s. In <b>clomiphene</b> <b>test,</b> an inhibition in serum LH level by clomiphene administration was seen in elderly subjects with 50 yr or older and, in addition, the incidence of the negative LH response became greater with the advance of age. In the negative responders, serum total T and E 2 were significantly (p< 0. 01) lower than those in the positive responders. However, in 14. 2 % of the elderly ?men with normal serum total T levels, and in 23. 1 % of the elderly men with normal serum E 2 levels showed negative response of LH in <b>clomiphene</b> <b>test.</b> Dopamine infusion did not modify LH response to iv bolus of LH-RH in young men (24 - 29 yr, n= 7) and in elderly men (51 - 80 yr, n= 12) whose LH response in control LH-RH test was within normal range. However, in elderly men who showed hyperresponse of LH in control LH-RH test (66 - 74 yr, n= 7), the hyperrespoders of LH was almost normalized by dopamine infusion. No significant differences were seen in serum total T, free T and E 2 levels, between the hyperresponders and non- hyperresponders of the elderly men. Naloxone significantly elevated serum LH levels in young men (20 - 48 yr, n-= 6), but did not change serum LH levels in elderly men (61 - 84 yr, n= 10). Serum LH response to naloxone, as analyzed by plasma peak/basal LH ratio, correlated significantly with age (r=- 0. 74, p< 0. 005) and serum free T (r= 0. 45,p< 0. 05). These results suggested that the hypersecretion of serum LH in elderly men could not simply be explained by the reduction in the negative feedback as a result of testicular insufficiency, but that the decline in the hypothalamic dopaminergic and opioidergic system is, at least in part, responsible for the hypersecretion of gonadotropin. It was also suggested that the decline in the dopaminergic system occurred independent of sex steroid milieu, however, the decline in the opioidergic system was thought to be the consequence of the reduction in serum sex steroid hormones...|$|E

The endocrine function of a follicle {{is related to}} its size. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate which sizes of antral follicles are most closely correlated with age and the outcome of endocrine ORTs. METHODS: In total 474 subfertile, ovulatory patients, recruited from two fertility centers in The Netherlands, participated in this prospective cohort study. The following ORTs were performed: AFC (follicles from 2 to 10 mm), basal FSH, basal inhibin B (bInhB), <b>clomiphene</b> citrate challenge <b>test</b> and inhibin B after stimulation with clomiphene citrate.

PATIENT(S) : Infertility population undergoing an IVF treatment. INTERVENTION(S) : None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Poor ovarian response, nonpregnancy. RESULT(S) : From the literature we identified and analyzed 12 studies on the CCCT according to preset criteria. In predicting poor response, the sensitivity and specificity of the CCCT varied from 35 % to 93 % and 47 % to 98 %, respectively. In predicting nonpregnancy, the sensitivity and specificity varied from 13 % to 66 % and 73 % to 97 %, respectively. Because of heterogeneity among studies, a summary receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve could not be estimated. Back-to-back comparison of the CCCT with basal FSH was possible in six studies. In predicting poor response, the sensitivity of the CCCT increased to some extent, whereas specificity did not increase or even diminished. In predicting nonpregnancy, the CCCT also showed an increase in sensitivity, counteracted by a decrease in specificity.

40|$|Hypogonadotropic {{hypogonadism}} (HH) {{is one of}} {{the least}} common etiologies for female infertility, although treatment in most cases leads to successful conception. The development of urinary-derived gonadotropins (hMG) a few decades ago paved the way to replacing the absent endogenous hormones (1, 2). Other alternatives to therapy include native GnRH or recombinant FSH, although the use of the time-honored hMG preparations leads in most cases to ovulation (3). It is of interest that the average treatment duration and the number of ampules used are higher compared with patients with other etiologies of infertility (2). This may be explained by the “dormant ” ovaries that need to be primed before follicular response is achieved. In most cases, the diagnosis of HH is made at an early age, and when pregnancy is desired, hMG treatment is initiated. In most cases, the patient has a good chance of becoming pregnant as often as she wants to. Occasionally, the patient may present for treatment at a more advanced age.

METHODS: Eighty-®ve regularly menstruating patients, aged 18 ± 39 years, participated in this prospective study, randomized, by a computer-designed four-blocks system into two groups. Forty-three patients underwent a CCCT, and 42 patients underwent an EFORT. Each test was performed 1 ± 4 times in subsequent cycles, one test per cycle. During the ®rst three cycles, patients were treated with intrauterine insemination (IUI). Follicle number and oocyte yield during IVF ovarian stimulation in the fourth cycle were taken as measures for ovarian reserve. RESULTS: The per cycle variance of bFSH ranged from 1. 8 to 4. 4 (maximum to minimum ratio of 2. 44, P 0. 2) and inhibin B increment (1. 31, P> 0. 2), which were the EFORT parameters. A large ICV of CCCT and bFSH test results was strongly associ-ated with lower ovarian reserve. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the ICV of the inhibin B increment and the E 2 increment in the EFORT is stable in consecutive cycles, which indicates that this reproducible test is a more reliable tool for determination of ovarian reserve than bFSH and CCCT.

Clomiphene citrate at 100 µg dose showed significant uterotrophic effect e. g., 435 · 57 % i. e., 36 · 58 ± 0 · 34 vs 6 · 83 ± 0 · 06 in immature and 586 % i. e., 103 · 80 ± 0 · 60 in ovariectomized mice · When clomiphene citrate was administered in combination with 0 · 32 µg of estradiol 17 -ß it caused significant antagonistic effect (decrease in uterine weight) at 10 and 100 µg respectively. Clomiphene citrate at 10 µg dose produced 32 % i·e·, 28 · 93 ± 0 · 43 vs 38 · 04 ± 2 · 68 in immature and 35 % i. e., 59 · 64 ± 1 · 44 vs 83 · 34 ± 0 · 25 in ovariectomized mice respectively. Histological observation clearly showed that clomiphene citrate at 10 and 100 µg doses did not cause any differential hypertrophy of the epithelial layer. Similar doses in combination with estradiol produced significant antagonistic effect on uterine weight and luminal epithelial cell height...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Endometriosis is a common, benign {{gynecological}} disease, {{associated with}} pelvic pain and infertility. It is generally {{thought to be}} caused by retrograde shedding of menstrual tissue with subsequent attachment to peritoneal surfaces. Endometriosis involves an altered inflammatory response and TNF seems to be an important pro-inflammatory mediator. Current medical treatment implies hormonal suppression associated with several side-effects. During treatment, pregnancy is either impossible or contra-indicated. Infertile women with endometriosis may conceive after assisted reproduction. However, during IVF, women with endometriosis often show a poor response to ovarian hyperstimulation and have lower pregnancy rate. This suggests that women with endometriosis have reduced ovarian reserve. Identifying diminished ovarian reserve is important during infertility treatment. Several factors have been proposed as markers of ovarian reserve. Aims : To study the effects of a TNF-inhibitor on induced endometriosis and pregnancy outcome in an experimental animal model; to evaluate the significance of two markers for ovarian reserve, FSH-receptor polymorphisms and AMH, in relation to infertility, endometriosis and inflammation. Material and methods: Endometriosis was induced in 18 female baboons and the extent of disease was measured during laparoscopy. The animals were randomized to either TNF-inhibitor (c 5 N, n= 11) or placebo (n= 7) for 25 days. The effects were evaluated by laparoscopy. 16 of the baboons received an additional 3 infusions of c 5 N (n= 9) or placebo (n= 7). Subsequently, timed mating was commenced. Pregnancy outcome was evaluated after 9 cycles. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at pos 680 (exon 10) in the FSH-receptor was analysed in 68 infertile women using PCR and DNA sequencing. 15 of these women had FSH-levels > 10 IU/ml on cycle day 3 or after <b>clomiphene</b> challenge <b>test</b> (CCCT). AMH was measured in serum and follicular fluid from 72 women with endometriosis (n= 34) and tubal factor infertility (n= 38). In addition, several cytokines and growth factors were analysed in follicular fluid during IVF. Results: Total surface area and volume of endometriotic lesions was significantly reduced in animals treated with c 5 N compared to placebo. The strongest effect was recorded for red lesions. No adverse effects were observed on the menstrual cycle in either group. Pregnancy rates and cycle fecundity rate (CFR) were comparable in both groups after timed mating. Women with FSH-receptor variant Serine/Serine at pos 680 had significantly higher FSH after CCCT but no differences in receptor distribution were observed. Women with endometriosis had lower AMH in serum and higher amounts of TNF in follicular fluid than women with tubal factor infertility. Women with endometriosis produced fewer small follicles and had a lower fertilization rate after IVF. Conclusion: The results support a central role for TNF in endometriosis. Women with endometriosis seemingly have a diminished ovarian reserve, related to increased inflammatory activity. Inhibition of TNF could represent a novel principle for the treatment of this common disease. Serum levels of AMH may aid the clinician to identify poor responders among women with endometriosis prior to IVF treatment. Also, certain FSH-receptor variants may be a characteristic for a subset of infertile women...|$|R
