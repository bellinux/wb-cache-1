5|$|Sutner {{defines a}} {{directed}} graph (a type of de Bruijn graph) {{in which each}} vertex represents a pair of assignments of states for the cells in a <b>contiguous</b> <b>sequence</b> of cells. The length of this sequence is chosen to be one less than the neighborhood size of the automaton. An edge in Sutner's graph represents a pair of sequences of cells that overlap {{in all but one}} cell, so that the union of the sequences is a full neighborhood in the cellular automaton. Each such edge is directed from the overlapping subsequence on the left to the subsequence on the right. Edges are only included in the graph when they represent compatible state assignments on the overlapping parts of their cell sequences, and when the automaton rule (applied to the neighborhood determined by the potential edge) would give the same results for both assignments of states. By performing a linear-time strong connectivity analysis of this graph, it is possible to determine which of its vertices belong to cycles. The transition rule is non-injective if and only if this graph contains a directed cycle in which at least one vertex has two differing state assignments.|$|E

The following year steps were taken to integrate the two stations. The platforms were renumbered in a single sequence, openings were made in the wall separating them to allow passengers to pass {{from one to the other}} without going into the street, and alterations were made to the tracks to allow for interchangeable working. The work was completed in 1925, and all platforms were renumbered in a <b>contiguous</b> <b>sequence.</b> Electric suburban services to Herne Hill and Orpington first ran on 12 July that year, followed by South London line services on 17 June 1928, and electric services to Crystal Palace and [...] (via [...] ) on 3 March 1929. The SR also concentrated Continental steamer traffic at Victoria, introducing the Golden Arrow, in 1924, and the Night Ferry in 1936.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the complex}} nature of {{interactions}} at the genomic level {{as well as the}} large number of proteins present in an organism, understanding the functions of various genes that are expressed is essential. Creating an analysis pipeline for Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) is one way to accomplish this, allowing a researcher to quickly take a set of sequences, perform all necessary analysis operations, and publish the data in a database with a graphical user interface (GUI). This pipeline falls into several steps. First, the data must be preprocessed to remove any extraneous sequence data, low-complexity regions, and regions that repeat throughout the genome. Next, it is necessary to combine a large number of ESTs into larger sequences that better describe the underlying mRNA. After larger <b>contiguous</b> <b>sequences</b> have been constructed, putative functions can be assigned to each sequence, whether part of a larger grouping or a singleton. An application of this pipeline using 3906 ESTs generated from trichome tissue of Pelargonium xhotorum (commonly, the geranium plant) resulted in 425 <b>contiguous</b> <b>sequences</b> using the CAP 3 program.

Chloroplasts play a particularly important role in the adaption for aquatic plants because they float on water and their major surface is exposed continuously to sunlight. The subfamily of Lemnoideae represents such a collection of aquatic species that because of photosynthesis represents {{one of the fastest growing}} plant species on earth. Methods: We sequenced the chloroplast genomes from three different genera of Lemnoideae, Spirodela polyrhiza, Wolffiella lingulata and Wolffia australiana by high-throughput DNA sequencing of genomic DNA using the SOLiD platform. Unfractionated total DNA contains high copies of plastid DNA so that sequences from the nucleus and mitochondria can easily be filtered computationally. Remaining sequence reads were assembled into <b>contiguous</b> <b>sequences</b> (contigs) using SOLiD software tools. Contigs were mapped to a reference genome of Lemna minor and gaps, selected by PCR, were sequenced on the ABI 3730 xl platform. Conclusions: This combinatorial approach yielded whole genomic <b>contiguous</b> <b>sequences</b> in a cost-effective manner. Over 1, 000 -time coverage of chloroplast from total DNA were reached by the SOLiD platform in a single spot on a quadrant slide without purification. Comparative analysis indicated that the chloroplast genome was conserved in gene number and organization with respect to the reference genome of L. minor.
