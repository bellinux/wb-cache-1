40|$|The Disposable Solid Waste Cask (DSWC) is a {{shielded}} cask {{capable of}} transporting, storing, and disposing of six non-fuel core components or approximately 27 {{cubic feet of}} radioactive solid waste. Five existing DSWCs are candidates for use in storing and disposing of non-fuel core components and radioactive solid waste from the Interim Examination and Maintenance Cell, ultimately shipping them to the 200 West Area disposal site for burial. A series of inspections, studies, analyses, and modifications were performed to ensure that these casks {{can be used to}} safely ship solid waste. These inspections, studies, analyses, and modifications are summarized and attached in this report. Visual inspection of the casks interiors provided information with respect to condition of the casks inner liners. Because water was allowed to enter the casks for varying lengths of time, condition of the <b>cask</b> <b>liner</b> pipe to bottom plate weld was of concern. Based on the visual inspection and a corrosion study, it was concluded that four of the five casks can be used from a corrosion standpoint. Only DSWC S/N- 004 would need additional inspection and analysis to determine its usefulness. The five remaining DSWCs underwent some modification to prepare them for use. The existing cask lifting inserts were found to be corroded and deemed unusable. New lifting anchor bolts were installed to replace the existing anchors. Alternate lift lugs were fabricated for use with the new lifting anchor bolts. The cask tiedown frame was modified to facilitate adjustment of the cask tiedowns. As a result of the above mentioned inspections, studies, analysis, and modifications, four of the five existing casks can be used to store and transport waste from the Interim Examination and Maintenance Cell to the disposal site for burial. The fifth cask, DSWC S/N- 004, would require further inspections before it could be used...|$|E

40|$|The {{subsurface}} radioactive {{disposal facility}} {{located at the}} U. S. Department of Energyâ€™s Idaho site contains neutron-activated metals from non-fuel nuclear-reactor-core components. A long-term corrosion study is being conducted to obtain site-specific corrosion rates to support efforts to more accurately estimate the transfer of activated elements in an arid vadose zone environment. The study uses non-radioactive metal coupons representing the prominent neutron-activated material buried at the disposal location, namely, two types of stainless steels, welded stainless steel, welded nickel-chromium steel alloy, zirconium alloy, beryllium, and aluminum. Additionally, carbon steel (the material used in <b>cask</b> disposal <b>liners</b> and other disposal containers) and duplex stainless steel (high-integrity containers) are {{also included in the}} study. This paper briefly describes the test program and presents the corrosion rate results through twelve years of underground exposure...|$|R
40|$|The {{subsurface}} radioactive {{disposal site}} {{located at the}} Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory contains neutron-activated metals from nonfuel nuclear-reactor- core components. A long-term corrosion test is being conducted to obtain site-specific corrosion rates to support efforts to more accurately estimate the transfer of activated elements in an arid vadose zone environment. The tests use nonradioactive metal coupons representing the prominent neutron-activated material buried at the disposal location, namely, Type 304 L stainless steel, Type 315 L stainless steel, nickel-chromium alloy (UNS NO 7718), beryllium, aluminum 6061 -T 6, and a zirconium alloy, (UNS R 60804). In addition, carbon steel (the material presently used in the <b>cask</b> disposal <b>liners</b> and other disposal containers) and a duplex stainless steel (UNS S 32550) (the proposed material for the high- integrity disposal containers) are {{also included in the}} test program. This paper briefly describes the test program and presents the early corrosion rate results after 1 year and 3 years of underground exposure...|$|R

A long-term underground corrosion test is being conducted to obtain site-specific corrosion rates to support efforts to more accurately estimate the transfer of activated elements in the surrounding arid vadose zone environment. The test uses nonradioactive metal coupons representing the prominent neutron-activated materials buried at the disposal location, namely, Type 304 L stainless steel (UNS S 30403), Type 316 L stainless steel (S 31603), nickel-chromium alloy (UNS NO 7718), beryllium, aluminum 6061 -T 6 (A 96061), and a zirconium alloy (UNS R 60804).
