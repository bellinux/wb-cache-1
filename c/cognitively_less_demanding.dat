When processing information, individuals with lower NFC often rely on salient information and shortcuts compared to individuals higher in NFC.

Therefore, individuals lower in NFC should tend to draw wider ranging inferences from salient achievement-related information.

Using odorless air as the baseline condition, activations were found bilaterally in the amygdala, piriform and insular cortices in both sexes, irrespective of the odor. No gender difference was detected in the pattern of cerebral activation (random effect analysis SPM 99, corrected p < 0. 05) or in the subjective perception of odors. Males and females seem to use similar cerebral circuits during the passive perception of odors. The reported female superiority in assessing olfactory information including odor identification is probably an effect of a difference at a cognitive, rather than perceptive level of olfactory processing...|$|E

40|$|The use of sign {{language}} with severely handi-capped students is analyzed {{in light of}} commonly held rationales.

40|$|Background: Fear {{learning}} in stressful situations is highly adaptive for survival by steering behavior in subsequent situations, but fear learning can become disproportionate in vulnerable individuals. Despite the potential clinical significance, the {{mechanism by which}} stress modulates fear learning is poorly understood. Memory theories state that stress can cause a shift away from more controlled processing depending on the hippocampus toward more reflexive processing supported by the amygdala and striatum. This shift may be mediated by activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) for cortisol. We investigated how stress shifts processes underlying cognitively demanding learning versus less demanding fear learning using a combined trace and delay fear conditioning paradigm. Methods: In a pharmacological {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} study, we tested 101 healthy men probing the effects of stress (socially evaluated cold pressor vs. control procedure) and MR-availability (400 mg spironolactone vs. placebo) in a randomized, placebo-controlled, full-factorial, between-subjects design. Results: Effective stress induction and successful conditioning were confirmed by subjective, physiologic, and somatic data. In line with a stress-induced shift, stress enhanced later recall of delay compared with trace conditioning in the MR-available groups as indexed by skin conductance responses. During learning, this was accompanied by a stress-induced reduction of learning-related hippocampal activity for trace conditioning. The stress-induced shift in fear and neural processing was absent in the MR-blocked groups. Conclusions: Our results are in line with a stress-induced shift in fear learning, mediated by the MR, resulting in a dominance of <b>cognitively</b> <b>less</b> <b>demanding</b> amygdala-based learning, which might be particularly prominent in individuals with high MR sensitivity...|$|E

Neuroscience {{research has shown that}} high 2 ̆ 010 level deliberative thinking processes are necessary for social 2 ̆ 010 decision making - it seems <b>cognitively</b> <b>less</b> <b>demanding</b> to be greedy or to mistrust. In this paper, our focus is on how commonly 2 ̆ 010 experienced adverse sleep states, which are known to harm deliberative thinking, impact outcomes in the classic simple bargaining games (ultimatum, dictator, and trust games). Specifically, we experimentally manipulate sleep states of 184 young 2 ̆ 010 adult subjects who took part in a 3 week experimental protocol. Subjects were administered each game twice: once after a full week of sleep restriction and once after a full week of well 2 ̆ 010 rested sleep levels.

We find a robust result of increased greed, reduced trust, and reduced trustworthiness following sleep restriction, after controlling for demographics and session indicators.

40|$|Rationale: Advances in neurocomputational {{modeling}} {{suggest that}} valuation systems for goal-directed (deliberative) on one side, and habitual (automatic) decision-making {{on the other}} side may rely on distinct computational strategies for reinforcement learning, namely model-free vs. model-based learning. As a key theoretical difference, the model-based system strongly demands cognitive functions to plan actions prospectively based on an internal cognitive model of the environment, whereas valuation in the model-free system relies on rather simple learning rules from operant conditioning to retrospectively associate actions with their outcomes and is thus <b>cognitively</b> <b>less</b> <b>demanding.</b> Acute stress reactivity is known to impair model-based but not model-free choice behavior, with higher working memory capacity protecting the model-based system from acute stress. However, it is not clear which impact accumulated real life stress has on model-free and model-based decision systems and how this influence interacts with cognitive abilities. Methods: We used a sequential decision-making task distinguishing relative contributions of both learning strategies to choice behavior, the Social Readjustment Rating Scale questionnaire to assess accumulated real life stress, and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test to test cognitive speed in 95 healthy subjects. Results: Individuals reporting high stress exposure who had low cognitive speed showed reduced model-based but increased model-free behavioral control. In contrast, subjects exposed to accumulated real life stress with high cognitive speed displayed increased model-based performance but reduced model-free control. Conclusion: These findings suggest that accumulated real life stress exposure can enhance reliance on cognitive speed for model-based computations, which may ultimately protect the model-based system from the detrimental influences of accumulated real life stress. The combination of accumulated real life stress exposure and slower information processing capacities, however, might favor model-free strategies. Thus, the valence and preference of either system strongly depends on stressful experiences and individual cognitive capacities...|$|E

On each of six recordings, each programmed {{on a different}} day and in a randomised order, operators rated alertness and performed different tasks. Self-rated alertness varied according to a typical diurnal trend. Time of day also affected reaction time (slower responses at 03 : 00 hours), discrimination performance (lower accuracy at 03 : 00 hours in the most difficult condition) and recall (superior recall at 07 : 00 and 11 : 00 hours following deeper processing at encoding). The data demonstrated time-of-day effects on cognitive processes also involved in many real-job activities, {{despite the lack of}} control for a number of exogenous factors known to interfere with performance in work settings. Since in the cognitively more loaded tasks, time-of-day effects depended on task conditions, the findings are of operational concern in shift-work situations involving differential task requirements.

DESIGN: Ten unilateral transfemoral amputees wearing conventional pneumatic swing phase control (conventional prosthesis) prostheses walked {{on a treadmill}} which enforced a pattern of constantly varying speeds. The subjects simultaneously performed a simple or a complex distracting task. Following a period of accustomization, the subjects performed the same test wearing a prosthesis with microprocessor control of swing phase damping (the Intelligent Prosthesis). OUTCOME MEASURES: The three-dimensional trajectory (sway) of a retroreflective marker attached to the forehead was measured by a video-based motion analysis system, and used {{as a measure of}} gait quality. The ratio of the sway for the complex task over the simple task (the 'automation index') was used as a measure of the degree of automation of gait. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the automation index between the two devices. However, the total sway for the conventional prosthesis was significantly higher. Sway during the complex distracting task was significantly higher than during the simple task.

40|$|Two problemsmay arisewhen an {{intelligent}} (recommender) system elicits users’ preferences. First, theremay be amismatch between the quantitative preference representations in most preference models and the users’ mental preference models. Giving exact numbers, e. g., such as “I like 30 days of vacation 2. 5 {{times better than}} 28 days” is difficult for people. Second, the elicitation process can greatly influence the acquired model (e. g., people may prefer different options based on whether a choice is represented as a loss or gain). We explored these issues in three studies. In the first experiment we presented userswith different preference elicitationmethods and found that <b>cognitively</b> <b>less</b> <b>demanding</b> methods were perceived low in effort and high in liking. However, for methods enabling users to be more expressive, the perceived effort was not an indicator of how much the methods were liked. We thus hypothesized that users are willing to spend more effort if the feedback mechanism enables {{them to be more}} expressive. We examined this hypothesis in two follow-up studies. In the second experiment, we explored the trade-off between giving detailed preference feedback and effort. We found that familiarity with and opinion about an item are important factors mediating this trade-off. Additionally, affective feedback was preferred over a finer grained one-dimensional rating scale for giving additional detail. In the third study, we explored the influence of the interface on the elicitation process in a participatory set-up. People considered it helpful to be able to explore the link between their interests, preferences and the desirability of outcomes. We also confirmed that people do not want to spend additional effort in cases where it seemed unnecessary.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{software}} applications is a multistage creative process. User Centred Design (UCD) is a methodology {{used to develop}} applications that consider {{the goals of the}} users as a primary requirement. The use of personas, archetypical users, in UCD is well established in the software industry. Personas may take various forms: personas, mash-up personas, incomplete personas and unspoken personas. The use of personas increases as the design progresses through stages. Personas are used to facilitate the design of applications focusing on target users and to communicate with stakeholders. Users' tasks of consuming the information from an application or web browser are cognitively demanding. It is expected that if the users' profile matches the application's personas, the users will find the application <b>cognitively</b> <b>less</b> <b>demanding.</b> Different techniques have been used to author personas with alternative media and varying information content, {{to such an extent that}} there is now a need to define the ontology of personas. This ontology would allow personas with consistent meanings to be shared across the design, development, test, marketing and sales teams; and would allow persona attributes and properties to be mapped to other design and development tools, such as actors, use cases and domain models. In this paper we explore the research question: how can we evaluate the usefulness of personas in software design, development, testing, communication and training? Through five case studies in various Australian industries, we provide insights into the use of personas in various phases of design, development, testing and training.

This study aimed to develop an experimental design which measures spatial {{cognitive abilities}} in the use of GIS, specifically the map overlay operation. Subjects (n = 134) received three map overlay tests in which they were given two of the following input map layers, logical operator(s), or output map layer(s). Subjects were required to select the correct logical operator for Test 1, to select the correct output map layer for Test 2, and to select the correct input map layers for Test 3. Each test contained a total of 16 questions, based on a 4 (’and’, ’or’, ’xor’, ’not’ operators) x 2 (one two polygons per map layer) x 2 (three or five polygon edges) factorial design. Results indicated a significant main effect of logical operators and number of polygons on performance; however, there was no effect of the number of polygon edges on performance Significant two-way interactions revealed an effect of the number of polygon edges and the number of polygons using various logical operators on performance, in addition, performance was not significantly different between males and females or between GIS users and non-users. Overall, results show that map overlays in which a visual correspondence can be made between the same polygons in the input and output map layers are <b>cognitively</b> <b>less</b> <b>demanding</b> than map overlays in which the shape of the polygons have been radically transformed between the input and output map layers.

With TPL, animals link biological significant events with the location {{and the time of}} day. This what-where-when type of memory provides animals with an experience-based daily schedule. Mice were tested for TPL five times throughout their lifespan and showed (re) learning from below chance level at the age of 4, 7, 12, and 18 mo. In contrast, at the age of 22 mo these mice showed preservation of TPL memory (absence of memory loss), together with deficiencies in the ability to update time-of-day information. Conversely, the majority of untrained (naïve) mice at 17 mo of age were unable to acquire TPL, indicating that training had delayed TPL deficiencies in the mice trained over lifespan. Two out of seven naïve mice, however, compensated for correct performance loss by adapting an alternative learning strategy that is independent of the age-deteriorating circadian system and presumably <b>less</b> <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding.</b> Together, these data show the age-sensitivity of TPL, and the positive effects of repeated training over a lifetime.

In support of the theoretical position that faking involves a <b>less</b> <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> process than responding honestly, we found that response times were on average 0. 25 s slower and participants had less eye fixations in the fake good condition. However, in the fake good condition, participants had more fixations on the 2 extreme response options of the 5 -point answering scale, and they fixated on these more directly after having read the question. These findings support the idea that faking leads to semantic rather than self-referenced item interpretations.

Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 110, 1608 - 1618. ] found that French speakers, {{as opposed to}} Spanish ones, are impaired in discrimination tasks with stimuli that vary only {{in the position of}} stress. However, what was called stress 'deafness' was only found in tasks that used high phonetic variability and memory load, not in <b>cognitively</b> <b>less</b> <b>demanding</b> tasks such as single token AX discrimination. This raised the possibility that instead of a perceptual problem, monolingual French speakers might simply lack a metalinguistic representation of contrastive stress, which would impair them in memory tasks. We examined a sample of 39 native speakers of French who underwent formal teaching of Spanish after age 10, and varied in degree of practice in this language. Using a sequence recall task, we observed in all our groups of late learners of Spanish the same impairment in short-term memory encoding of stress contrasts that was previously found in French monolinguals. Furthermore, using a speeded lexical decision task with word-nonword minimal pairs that differ only in the position of stress, we found that all late learners had much difficulty in the use of stress to access the lexicon. Our results show that stress 'deafness' is better interpreted as a lasting processing problem resulting from the impossibility for French speakers to encode contrastive stress in their phonological representations. This affects their memory encoding as well as their lexical access in on-line tasks. The generality of such a persistent suprasegmental 'deafness' is discussed in relation to current findings and models on the perception of non-native phonological contrasts. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

Our analysis starts with Proto-Uralic, and then we compare its developmental path to other languages in the Indo-European family. It has been documented that in Proto-Uralic (ca. 4, 000 BC) there existed e ‘no’, but not word for ‘yes’ (cf. Décsy 1977 : 81 - 82). Our hypothesis proposed in this paper is that human languages initially managed without ‘yes’ and ‘no’. Answers were given by repeating a verb, e. g. Are you happy – I am (for ‘yes’) and I am not (for ‘no’). The ‘no’-word was created by dropping a verb (e. g. not from I am not), and it stood on its on at the initial stage and later became an independent word. Since the negative answer can be given with ‘no’, its affirmative counterpart is somehow required, given a rise of ‘yes’. This line of argument is related to the binary features commonly found in the grammar of proto-languages (what Toyota 2004 terms kaleidoscopic grammar). Binary features are often <b>cognitively</b> <b>less</b> <b>demanding</b> and they suited the basic frame of emergent grammatical structures. In this sense, the presence of ‘no’ on its own in Proto-Uralic is considered to have forced its opposition ‘yes’ to appear in the course of forming the modern Uralic languages. It is true that {{it is much easier to}} find a linkage between the negative marker and ‘no’, and the word for ‘yes’ is often difficult to trace historically. For instance, in Slavic languages, the common ‘yes’-‘no’ pair is da/tak ‘yes’ and nie/ni/ne ‘no’, except in Slovak, e. g. áno ‘yes’/nie ‘no’. The binary feature can be found beyond linguistic features. For instance, pre-historic artefacts, such as spearhead, axes, cave paintings, etc., are normally binary in shape or design. This suggests that emergence of complex patterning is reasonably late in human evolution. One possible exception is the Celt: earlier artefacts from their civilisation involve a complex ternary or quaternary patterning. Interestingly, Celtic languages do not have the ‘yes’-‘no’ words, and they still repeat verbs in reply. This specific case needs further analysis, but it seems to suggest that the longer period for binary features is required for the development of ‘yes’ and ‘no’. This clearly shows that there is relationship between binary features of human cognition and the development of ‘yes’ and ‘no’. So, the study of the origin of these words should deserve more attention...|$|E
40|$|The {{literacy}} skills that students develop in preschool are an imperative aspect of school readiness and later academic success. Research has established {{that some students}} begin their educational experience at a disadvantage due to the low socioeconomic status (SES) of their family and, as a result, low levels of conversation between parents and children, restricted access to books, and low values placed on literacy. Past research supports that shared book reading {{is one of the}} most beneficial activities in which teachers can partake in order to optimize their students’ language development. The Head Start program is intended to alleviate the SES gap by providing a high quality education to preschool students. However, as measured by the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS), Head Start teachers are failing nationally in the area of Instructional Support, or implementing curriculum effectively in order to promote language and cognitive development. This study was designed to provide a book reading training to Head Start teachers in order to increase their level and frequency of Cognitively Challenging Talk with their students. Results found that Cognitively Challenging Talk increased as a result of the training as well as the amount of words the teacher utilized; <b>Less</b> <b>Cognitively</b> <b>Demanding</b> Talk and Managing Interaction variables, or classroom management aspects, were not significantly change...|$|R
40|$|Provider {{order entry}} systems (POE) often {{incorporate}} active decision-support component for drug dosing. The efficacy of automated alerts that suggest dose {{amounts to the}} clinician in real time depends in part on how well they are timed {{to fit into the}} decision process and on their representational structure. We have conducted a cognitive evaluation of an interaction with a POE system that offered active decision support for heparin dosing with the goal of characterizing its effectiveness and opportunities for error. Two researchers completed a cognitive walkthrough of an ordering task based on a clinical scenario. In addition, seven clinicians were asked to enter a set of orders in an experiment using the same scenario. The analysis revealed that users without a solid conceptual knowledge of the ordering system followed patterns of inefficient interactive behavior resulting in delays and some errors. Physicians often did not take full advantage of automatic dose computation provided by a decision support component and used it largely as reference. The calculated dose was not perceptually salient in the generated alert and required users to engage in meaning interpretation of the displayed information. Better visual presentation of the alert message would likely result in faster and <b>less</b> <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> interaction.

40|$|Background. Cognitive {{impairment}} {{has been}} shown to predict falls risk in older adults. The ability to step accurately is necessary to safely traverse challenging terrain conditions such as uneven or slippery surfaces. However, it is unclear how well persons with cognitive impairment can step accurately to avoid such hazards and what specific aspects of cognition predict stepping ability in different patient populations. Methods. Healthy older adults (NC), patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment with only memory impairment (MCI– EF) or memory and executive function impairments (MCIþEF) and early Alzheimer’s patients (AD) were timed as they performed a stepping accuracy test with increasing cognitive demand (Walking Trail-Making Test; W-TMT), which required stepping on instrumented targets with either increasing sequential numbers (W-TMT A) or alternating sequential numbers and letters (W-TMT B). Results. After accounting for age and baseline walking speed, the AD and MCIþEF groups were significantly slower than the NC and MCI–EF groups on the task with the highest cognitive demand, W-TMT B (interaction effect F 6. 781, p,. 0001). No group differences were noted on the W-TMT A task that was <b>less</b> <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding.</b> Neuropsychological measures of executive functioning were associated with slower W-TMT B performance, whereas memory, visual attention and visual spatial skills were not (adjusted R 2 0. 42). Conclusions. Executive function is important for stepping performance, particularly under more complex envi...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the central {{processing}} of two unpleasant sensations, itch and pain, and how these sensations can be modulated using psychological tools. The initial section focuses on the induction and modulation of thermal noxious stimuli {{and the way in}} which this is represented in the brain. It is well known that pain can be modulated by distraction, and also which areas of the brain are frequently activated by noxious stimuli. The research reported here expands upon this knowledge. The first study found that when subjects were engaged in a cognitively demanding task (the Counting Stroop task) their attention was distracted away from thermal painful stimuli. They reported a significantly (p= 0. 006) lower pain intensity rating for stimuli during the interference (more cognitively demanding) task compared to the neutral (<b>less</b> <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding)</b> task. The interference task was confirmed to be more difficult than the neutral task by significantly increased reaction times in the former compared to the latter. The reduced perception of painful thermal stimuli applied during the interference task compared with those felt in the neutral task was accompanied by a reduced activation in some key components of the pain matrix (insula, mid-cingulate, thalamus). Some key pain processing regions showed an increase in signal during the interference task compared with the neutral task (perigenual cingulate, orbitofrontal regions).
