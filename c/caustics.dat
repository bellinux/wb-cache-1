5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387L is a {{red dwarf}} in the Sagittarius {{constellation}} that is host to the planet MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb. The star {{is estimated to be}} nearly 20,000 light years away and approximately one fifth the mass of the Sun, although large confidence intervals exist, reflecting the uncertainties in both the mass and distance. The star drew the attention of astronomers when it became the lens of gravitational microlensing event MOA-2009-BLG-387L, in which it eclipsed a background star and created distorted <b>caustics,</b> an envelope of reflected or refracted light rays. Analysis of the caustic events and of follow-up observational data led to the planet's discovery, which was reported in February 2011.|$|E

In this paper was focused on temperature factor that play key role in mercaptans extraction and <b>caustic</b> regeneration.

25|$|Huygens had experimented in 1672 {{with double}} {{refraction}} (birefringence) in Icelandic spar (calcite), a phenomenon discovered in 1669 by Rasmus Bartholin. At first {{he could not}} elucidate what he found. He later explained it with his wave front theory and concept of evolutes. He also developed ideas on <b>caustics.</b> Newton in his Opticks of 1704 proposed instead a corpuscular theory of light. The theory of Huygens was not accepted, by some, because longitudinal waves cannot show birefringence. The interference experiments of Thomas Young vindicated a wave theory in 1801: the results could not be explained with light particles. The {{solution to the problem}} Huygens had faced was then resolved by a transverse wave theory. For a view from modern physics see wave–particle duality.|$|E
25|$|To see why exotic {{matter is}} required, {{consider}} an incoming light front traveling along geodesics, which then crosses the wormhole and re-expands {{on the other}} side. The expansion goes from negative to positive. As the wormhole neck is of finite size, we would not expect <b>caustics</b> to develop, at least within {{the vicinity of the}} neck. According to the optical Raychaudhuri's theorem, this requires a violation of the averaged null energy condition. Quantum effects such as the Casimir effect cannot violate the averaged null energy condition in any neighborhood of space with zero curvature, but calculations in semiclassical gravity suggest that quantum effects may be able to violate this condition in curved spacetime. Although it was hoped recently that quantum effects could not violate an achronal version of the averaged null energy condition, violations have nevertheless been found, so it remains an open possibility that quantum effects might be used to support a wormhole.|$|E

In a process called gravitational microlensing, the star MOA-2009-BLG-387L became a lens that created two distorted caustic images. In {{the case of the}} microlensing event MOA-2009-BLG-387, these <b>caustics</b> produced a series of small [...] "resonating" [...] diffractions; such resonant-caustic events are valued because they tend to yield more information about an orbiting planet.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the direct}} {{illumination}} is generally best sampled using eye-based ray tracing, certain indirect effects {{can benefit from}} rays generated from the lights. <b>Caustics</b> are bright patterns caused by the focusing of light off a wide reflective region onto a narrow area of (near-)diffuse surface. [...] An algorithm that casts rays directly from lights onto reflective objects, tracing their paths to the eye, will better sample this phenomenon. This integration of eye-based and light-based rays is often expressed as bidirectional path tracing, in which paths are traced from both the eye and lights, and the paths subsequently joined by a connecting ray after some length.|$|E

The <b>caustic</b> exiting the cell line must be monitored for strength, to maintain safe concentrations. Too strong or too weak a solution may damage the membranes. Membrane cells typically produce <b>caustic</b> in the range of 30% to 33% by weight. The feed <b>caustic</b> flow is heated at low electrical loads to control its exit temperature. Higher loads require the <b>caustic</b> to be cooled, to maintain correct exit temperatures. The <b>caustic</b> exiting to storage is pulled from a storage tank and may be diluted for sale to customers who require weak <b>caustic</b> or for use on site.

In this study, we investigated the impact of <b>caustic</b> strength in the cathode compartment {{and the impact of}} sodium concentration in sewage on the Coulombic efficiency (CE) for <b>caustic</b> generation.

The swellings in some grew hard, and they applied violent drawing plasters, or poultices, to break them; and, if these did not do, they cut and scarified them in a terrible manner. In some, those swellings were made hard, partly by the force of the distemper, and partly by their being too violently drawn, and were so hard that no instrument could cut them; and then they burned them with <b>caustics,</b> so that many died raving mad with the torment, and some in the very operation. In these distresses, some, for want of help to hold them down in their beds or to look to them, laid hands upon themselves as above; some broke out into the streets, perhaps naked, and would run directly down to the river, if they were not stopped by the watchmen or other officers, and plunge themselves into the water wherever they found it.|$|E
