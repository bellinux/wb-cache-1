40|$|In psychometric {{sciences}} {{the choice}} of a good response scale is a typical problem. Several studies (see, in particular, Bonanomi, 2004) proved that different measurement scales lead to highly dissimilar evaluations of goods/services, in particular in the measurement of observable variables in latent variables models. So, this requires that proper <b>cograduation</b> indices should be available, in order to compare the attitude of different measurement scales (typically ordinal scales) in assigning the various and different number of allowed response modalities...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new index to analyse the {{dependence}} between categorical variables is presented and {{is compared to}} other measures of association, mainly based on the X 2 Pearson’s statistic. The new index is compared to well-known measures of <b>cograduation,</b> as well. To restrict our comparisons, the domain we consider includes all the square contingency tables belonging to the same Fréchet class, {{that is all the}} contingency tables in which the marginal frequencies are given as fixed in both characters. Anyway, the new index is good even if there are no constrain on the marginal distributions, but only a constrain on n, the total of the observations...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{innovation}} for global competition {{as well as}} its influence upon economic growth have gradually increased the interest for this subject, both from an economic and from a political point of view. Basing on the existing literature, this paper aims at measuring and describing the innovative capability of italian regional systems, so as to improve the comprehension of this phenomenon as well as of its effects. Plenty of input, output and context conditions are considered, since the systemic nature {{of innovation}} requires a simultaneous analysis of all possible variables, actors and relationships involved. Eighty indicators are selected and used to create syntetic measures about innovation and regional economic development. Best solutions are pointed out, paying attention to their score, internal composition and sustainability. Not only the intensity but also {{the nature of the relationship}} between innovation input and output and between innovation and economic growth is studied by means of independence, <b>cograduation</b> and interdependence indicators, as well as through the application of regression models. ...|$|E
