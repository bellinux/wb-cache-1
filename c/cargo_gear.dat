2500|$|The vessel had an {{increased}} baking and a midship deckhouse with underlying engine room. The longitudinal-framed hull was ice-reinforced. Built as a closed shelter-decker, Adele had a grain capacity of [...] and an internal volume of [...] ball steerage. Two {{of the four}} cargo holds were arranged {{in front of the}} bridge structure, two were behind it. The two front rooms were accessible by three hatches, the aft rooms had one hatch each. The cargo consisted of 12 normal light derricks on all hatches and a 25-ton heavy lift on hold 2. The 12 AEG-type winches, manufactured under license by Kampnagel Schaerffe, Hamburg, were designed to lift 3 tons at /min in single gear, or 5 tons at that speed in double gear. Each was driven by an 18.4-kW electric motor. The derricks between the two forward hatches were attached to double post, which served simultaneously as a cargo space ventilation of 20 changes of air per hour, the second front and aft <b>cargo</b> <b>gear</b> was on conventional central derricks. The hatches were fitted with a sliding steel hatch cover, and the main deck was lined with [...] thick Oregon pine to prevent heat radiation, assumably to carry fruits. However, no refrigeration plant was fitted, hence the carriage of any fruit had been restricted to short sea trade, such as from Spain or Canary Islands to North Europe. Besides the shaft tunnel there were cargo tanks.|$|E

50|$|The Chief Officer/First mate (often {{called the}} Chief mate in the United States) {{is the head}} of the deck {{department}} on a merchant vessel, second-in-command after the ship's Master. The Chief mate's primary responsibilities are the vessel's cargo operations, its stability, and supervising the deck crew. The mate is responsible for the safety and security of the ship, as well as the welfare of the crew on board. The chief mate typically stands the 4-8 navigation watch as OICNW (officer in-charge of the navigational watch), directing the bridge team. Some crews have additional Third mates, which allow the Chief mate to not stand navigational watch, and focus more on cargo and deck operations. Additional duties include maintenance of the ship's hull, <b>cargo</b> <b>gears,</b> accommodations, life saving appliances and firefighting appliances. The chief mate also trains the crew and cadets on various aspects like safety, firefighting, search and rescue, and various other contingencies. The chief officer assumes command of the whole ship in the absence or incapacitation of the master.|$|R

50|$|In July 1967 the Chandris {{shipping}} family, (now Celebrity Cruises) bought Kenya Castle and renamed her Amerikanis ("American maiden"). She went to Greece to be refitted as {{a full-time}} cruise ship. Her cargo holds were replaced with additional cabins, increasing passenger capacity to about 920. She became known for being the first passenger ship to have a television in every cabin. All public rooms were refurbished in contemporary European style. Her hull was repainted white. Other than the removal of <b>cargo</b> handling <b>gear,</b> Amerikanis retained much of her original profile.|$|R

50|$|An AB day worker {{performs}} general maintenance, repair, sanitation and upkeep of material, equipment, {{and areas}} in the deck department. This can include maintenance of the ship's metal structures such as chipping, scraping, cleaning, priming, and painting. Areas frequently in need of such maintenance include the hull, decks, superstructure, <b>cargo</b> <b>gear,</b> and smoke stack. Day workers also frequently perform maintenance on lifeboats, rescue boats and liferafts, and emergency and damage control gear. For many vessels, being a dayworker is a position granted to senior AB's, since it generally allows more time for rest and relaxation.|$|E
50|$|When {{the vessel}} {{was sold to}} Shaw, Savill & Albion Line, she was renamed Ocean Monarch however no {{structural}} alterations were then made. On 14 April 1970 she departed Southampton on a line voyage to Australia, arriving at Sydney, New South Wales, on 15 May. Two cruises to Japan (to coincide with Expo) were then undertaken, before the ship returned to Southampton. The vessel then proceeded to the Cammell Laird facility at Birkenhead for a major refit. This work included removal of the vessel's extensive cargo holds and <b>cargo</b> handling <b>gear,</b> installation of additional passenger cabins and the re-design of the ship's stern, to include a large swimming pool/lido area with a new bar/discothèque beneath.|$|R
50|$|Savannah {{measures}} 596.5 ft {{in length}} and 78 ft in beam, with a loaded draft of 29.5 ft, and a loaded displacement of 21,800 tons. Savannah was built with seven cargo holds, a reactor compartment and a machinery compartment, making nine water-tight compartments. There are three full decks. The reactor compartment is located {{near the center of}} the ship, with the superstructure just aft of the reactor top to allow the reactor to be refuelled. Holds 1 through 4 are forward of the superstructure, with <b>cargo</b> handling <b>gear</b> between 1 and 2 and between 3 and 4. Cargo hold 5 is served by side ports, as it is located beneath the swimming pool. Holds 6 and 7 are aft of the superstructure.|$|R
50|$|The Massachusetts Maritime Academy {{acquired}} the vessel in 1984 and renamed it Patriot State. It was {{converted to a}} training vessel in two stages by the Triple A Shipyard in San Francisco, California and Bender Shipyard in Mobile, Alabama. The <b>cargo</b> handling <b>gear</b> was removed, except for the forward yard and stay rig, and teaching facilities installed. Patriot State entered service as a training ship in the Spring of 1986. Fourteen training cruises from 1986-98, typically lasting around sixty days during the winter, were used to provide cadets with practical experience. Over the ship's service, various improvements {{were made to the}} berthing spaces, and controlled superheaters were installed on the boilers to increase the top safe speed of the ship.|$|R

50|$|A {{multi-purpose}} vessel (MPV) is a {{seagoing ship}} that is {{built for the}} carriage {{of a wide range}} of cargoes. Examples of these cargoes are: wood, steel, building materials, rolls of paper and bulk cargo. Multi-purpose vessels can be divided into four categories: vessels with and without <b>cargo</b> <b>gear,</b> coastal trade liners and sea-river vessels. Bigger multi-purpose vessels are able to carry different kinds of loading on the same voyage. Smaller multi-purpose vessels do not have this advantage but they are employed to get into smaller harbours because of their limited draught. Because of their varying operating conditions, these ships have complex designs that are difficult to build. Their all-round design must be able to carry heavy loads, large objects and unitised cargo as bulk cargo. These cargoes can be rolled or lifted on board so this requires different types of loading gear, as well.|$|E
