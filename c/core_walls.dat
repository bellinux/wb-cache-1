The results showed that the free surface of the upstream dam shell rockfill body dropping fast than the water level dropping speed of the reservoir. The seepage gradient of the upstream shell is very small, which will not cause adverse effect on the upstream dam slope stability. The free surface of the downstream dam shell rockfill body changes little, which will not cause adverse effect on the downstream of the dam slope stability. As the water level falls, the free surface of the <b>core</b> <b>wall</b> dropping speed is slow, far less than the water dropping speed of the reservoir.

Standing at 280 m, the 66 -storey Republic Plaza building {{is one of}} the tallest buildings in Singapore. The structural system of the building comprises a reinforced concrete <b>core</b> <b>wall</b> and a structural steel frame. The steel tube columns, filled with concrete, form an external ring, while the horizontal steel frame systems simply supported at the <b>core</b> <b>wall</b> support a composite slab at each floor. A large number of stress and strain gauges were embedded inside the <b>core</b> <b>wall</b> and the concrete filled tube (CFT) columns. At selected floors, strain gauges were mounted in the steel beams. During construction, the trends observed in stress and strain measurements of the <b>core</b> <b>wall</b> and the CFT columns are generally consistent with the increasing dead loads, while the tends in strain data for the floor beams are more complex. An ambient vibration survey (AVS) was conducted after the completion of the structure. From the AVS measurements of dynamic lateral response, natural frequencies and mode shapes for lower lateral and torsional modes have been obtained. Results of the finite element models for the core wall/steel framing system agree reasonably well with the measured translational fundamental frequencies. However, without a high level of refinement, the finite element models cannot reflect the torsional behaviour. There {{is no evidence that the}} curtain wall system affects stiffness or damping properties of the structure at low excitation levels...|$|R

This strategy is based on allowing the damage to be concentrated on main structural components.
