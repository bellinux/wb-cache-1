500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{review of the}} album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic appreciated the new direction of Carey's music, commenting on the increased urban feel of the work. He described the record as [...] "a collection of hit singles surrounded by classy filler" [...] and [...] "while [...] are all well-crafted, many of them blend together upon initial listening". However, he noted an increased control in her voice which led him to describe some of the ballads such as 'Butterfly' and 'Breakdown' as among her best work. He said Butterfly was one of Carey's best records and she was [...] "continuing to improve and refine her music, which makes her a rarity among her '90s peers." [...] Rich Juzwiak from Slant Magazine awarded the album a score of {{four and a half}} out of five stars, calling it [...] "elegant" [...] and praising Carey's mature vocals. Juzwiak particularly praised [...] "Breakdown", which he called one of the album's best tracks. Of Carey's vocals, he wrote, [...] "The relatively high and thin register that she sings in when not belting (and that's often) <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important of Butterfly's changes, as it marks the first time that Mariah the vocalist seems consistently real. She's utterly soulful." [...] In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, critic Robert Christgau gave Butterfly a [...] "dud" [...] rating, indicating [...] "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought".|$|E

2500|$|Because {{the game}} was found only {{recently}} after centuries of obscurity, {{it is difficult to}} say exactly what all the rules were.

[...] The board, and likewise the pieces, were made much smaller, making archeological finds difficult to decipher. [...] Research into this game continues for historical and cultural reasons, but also to satisfy the curious and those who wish to play what <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> challenging chess-like game ever made.

Nick Levine of Digital Spy favoured the song, saying, [...] "Leona delivers it beautifully. In fact, her vocal run from 2:39 to 2:44 <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> incredible five seconds of singing we've heard all year. [...] It's a really strong lead single that sounds like a number one, and a typically muscular production from Tedder, but above all it's a powerful and moving song".

In waiting for the hour, she observed some stir in the castle, which had been silent as the grave ever since the seclusion of the Duke of Rothsay. The portcullis was lowered and raised, and the creaking of the machinery was intermingled with the tramp of horse, as men at arms went out and returned with steeds hard ridden and covered with foam. She observed, too, that such domestics as she casually saw from her window were in arms. All this made her heart throb high, for it augured the approach of rescue; and besides, the bustle left the little garden more lonely than ever. At length the hour of noon arrived; she had taken care to provide, under pretence of her own wishes, which the pantler seemed disposed to indulge, such articles of food as <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> easily conveyed to the unhappy captive.
