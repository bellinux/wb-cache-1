6000|$|After {{spanning}} the valley {{we began to}} ascend the lower slopes of a high range, whose folds formed like a curtain the bold background of the view. This is the landward face of the Ghauts, over which we were to pass before sighting the sea. Masses of cold grey cloud rolled from the table-formed summit, we were presently shrouded in mist, and as we advanced, rain began to fall. The light of day vanishing, we again descended into a Fiumara with a tortuous and rocky bed, the main drain of the landward mountain side. My companions, now half-starved,--they had lived through three days {{on a handful of}} dates and sweetmeats,--devoured with avidity the wild Jujube berries that strewed the stones.

We sprang in pleased astonishment from the saddle, dire had been the anticipations that our mules,--one of them already required driving with the spear,--would, after another night of starvation, leave us to carry their loads upon our own hacks.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{prototype}} model for an automatic anti-glare system {{to reduce the}} risk of accidents during night time driving. The architecture consists of an aperture assembly and sensors. The aperture assembly is a two dimensional array of aperture elements, and their transmittances can be independently controllable. According to the transmittance, each aperture element will act either as opaque or transparent. The intensity of light ray is modulated by the transmittance of aperture elements, which causes the reduction of intensity of light passing through it. The prototype is implemented using liquid crystal display (LCD) and photovoltaic sensors. This system provides an automated mechanism to control the illumination according to the direction of incoming light. The fundamental idea is to measure the incoming light and using measured values to generate patterns on the LCD to reduce the illumination. The proposed prototype can be implemented in two ways: i) as spectacles with liquid <b>crystal</b> <b>sheets</b> placed in front of the glasses, which can be used while driving, ii) by placing large liquid <b>crystal</b> <b>sheets</b> in front of the windshields of vehicles.

40|$|AbstractHigh {{intensity}} focused ultrasound (HIFU) {{treatment that}} employs microbubbles to provide enhanced heating {{has been investigated}} {{in order to develop}} a less invasive and more rapid tumor ablation therapy. It has been demonstrated that microbubbles have significant effects on heating enhancement in vitro and in vivo experiments, however ultrasound propagation could be disturbed when there are too many microbubbles between the transducer and the focus. In this study, we develop a method to make a clear pass way for obtaining enhanced heating by using microbubbles just at the focus, thus avoiding heating on the pass way from the transducer to the target region. In this method, microbubbles are destroyed in front of the HIFU focus (on the transducer side) by irradiating a intense burst wave of microsecond order, before irradiating the ultrasound waves for heating the target region. The experiment is conducted in a medium of a polyacrylamide gel containing microbubbles, and a temperature-sensing liquid <b>crystal</b> <b>sheet</b> is set in the focus to observe the temperature distribution. The ultrasound frequency was 2. 2 MHz and the intensity was 5000 W/cm 2, and 20 burst waves were irradiated at pulse repetition frequency of 1 kHz. The number of wave pulses was varied. The continuous-wave frequency, intensity and irradiation time are 2. 2 MHz, 1000 W/cm 2 and 60 sec, respectively. As the number of pulses increased, the heating region moves from the transducer side to the focus. This is because microbubbles in front of the focus are destroyed and the ultrasound propagates around the target position effectively. These results suggest that the microbubble distribution and the heating position in the developed HIFU system can be controlled...|$|E

Because the ensuing driving temperature difference is small, experimental determination of {{heat transfer coefficient}} is a challenge. The statistical nature of droplet distribution in the ensemble contributes to the intricacy of analysis and interpretation. Against this background, the spatial distribution of temperature during drop-wise condensation over a polyethylene substrate was measured using liquid crystal thermography (LCT) simultaneously with actual visualization of the condensation process by videography. Experiments were conducted {{in such a way}} that pendant drops form on the underside of the liquid <b>crystal</b> <b>sheet.</b> Temperature variation at the base of the droplets, as small as 0. 4 mm, were satisfactorily resolved. The signature of the drop shape was visible in the LCT images. The drop size distribution on the substrate was simultaneously visualized. Static contact angles of water on polyethylene are measured and drop shapes were estimated via a mathematical model for comparison. Using a one-dimensional heat transfer approximation, heat flux profiles through individual droplets were obtained. The temperature profiles from LCT combined with drop sizes from direct visualization provide sufficient data for understanding the heat transfer mechanism during drop-wise condensation. Results show that the measured heat flux as a function of drop diameter matches published data for large drop sizes but fails for small drops where the thermal resistance of the LCT sheet is a limiting factor. To a first approximation, the present work shows that drop size can be correlated to the local heat flux. Hence, the average heat flux over a surface can be obtained entirely from the drop size distribution...|$|E

40|$|Magnesium, with a Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP) structure, is {{the eighth}} most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} earth’s crust and the third most plentiful element dissolved in the seawater. Magnesium alloys exhibit the attractive characteristics of low densities and high strength-to-weight ratios along with good castability, recyclability, and machinability. Replacing the steel and/or aluminum sheet parts with magnesium sheet parts in vehicles {{is a great way}} of reducing the vehicles weight, which results in great savings on fuel consumption. The lack of magnesium sheet components in vehicle assemblies is due to magnesium’s poor room-temperature formability. In order to successfully form the sheets of magnesium at room temperature, it is necessary to understand the formability of magnesium at room temperature controlled by various plastic deformation mechanisms. The plastic deformation mechanisms in pure magnesium and some of its alloys at room temperature are crystallographic slip and deformation twinning. The slip systems in magnesium at room temperature are classified into primary (first generation), secondary (second generation), and tertiary (third generation) slip systems. The twinning systems in magnesium at room temperature are classified into primary (first generation) and secondary (second generation, or double) twinning systems. A new comprehensive rate-dependent elastic-viscoplastic Crystal Plasticity Constitutive Model (CPCM) that accounts for all these plastic deformation mechanisms in magnesium was proposed. The proposed model individually simulates slip-induced shear in the parent {{as well as in the}} primary and secondary twinned regions, and twinning-induced shear in the primary and secondary twinned regions. The model also tracks the texture evolution in the parent, primary and secondary twinned regions. Separate resistance evolution functions for the primary, secondary, and tertiary slip systems, as well as primary and secondary twinning systems were considered in the formulation. In the resistance evolution functions, the interactions between various slip and twinning systems were accounted for. The CPCM was calibrated using the experimental data reported in the literature for pure magnesium single crystals at room temperature, but needs further experimental data for full calibration. The partially calibrated model was used to assess the contributions of various plastic deformation mechanisms in the material stress-strain response. The results showed that neglecting secondary slip and secondary twinning while simulating plastic deformation of magnesium alloys by crystal plasticity approach can lead to erroneous results. This indicates that all the plastic deformation mechanisms have to be accounted for when modelling the plastic deformation in magnesium alloys. Also, the CPCM in conjunction with the Marciniak–Kuczynski (M–K) framework were used to assess the formability of a magnesium single <b>crystal</b> <b>sheet</b> at room temperature by predicting the Forming Limit Diagrams (FLDs). Sheet necking was initiated from an initial imperfection in terms of a narrow band. A homogeneous deformation field was assumed inside and outside the band, and conditions of compatibility and equilibrium were enforced across the band interfaces. Thus, the CPCM only needs to be applied to two regions, one inside and one outside the band. The FLDs were simulated under two conditions: a) the plastic deformation mechanisms are primary slip systems alone, and b) the plastic deformation mechanisms are primary slip and primary twinning systems. The FLDs were computed for two grain orientations. In the first orientation, primary extension twinning systems had favourable orientation for activation. In the second orientation, primary contraction twinning systems had favourable orientation for activation. The effects of shear strain outside the necking band, rate sensitivity, and c/a ratio on the simulated FLDs in the two grain orientations were individually explored...|$|E

The results should be applicable in situations where melt flows are not intense enough to change the thermal field in pure systems, or where the physical properties of the melt are such that the convective field is decoupled from the thermal field, the latter being established primarily by diffusion...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{low cost}} set-up to {{determine}} the location of shunts in solar cells has been developed. Our manual system can reproducibly detect all major shunts in large area reverse biased solar cells {{at a rate of}} 1 cell every 12 seconds and allows therefore the imaging of large numbers of cells in a short time. The system is based on the use of commercial liquid <b>crystal</b> <b>sheets</b> which are brought into thermal contact with the solar cell by vacuum. The colour change of the sheet is an indication of the local heating of the cell at shunt locations under reverse bias at typical voltages between - 2 and - 10 V. The detected shunts are the same as the ones found in lock-in infrared thermography at reverse bias. We discuss some of the system specifications and limitations and give several application examples, with a special emphasis on edge isolation. (orig.)

40|$|Extending the {{response}} range of wide-bandgap (3. 2 eV) anatase TiO 2 photocatalysts into the visible light range {{can play an}} important role in promoting the practical applications of photocatalysts. Here, we report a route to prepare sulfur doped anatase TiO 2 single <b>crystal</b> <b>sheets</b> with a high percentage of (0 0 1) facets. The resultant TiO 2 sheets were investigated by a combination of experimental characterizations and electronic structure calculations. The synthesized sulfur doped anatase samples show an additional visible light absorption band from 400 nm to ca. 550 nm and some visible-light photocatalytic activity in (OH) -O-center dot radical generation and photodecomposition of organic dyes. The Ti-S bond structure causes not only visible light absorption but also changes to an extent the surface structures of doped anatase TiO 2 sheets. Theoretically, localized 3 p states of S formed in the bandgap are implicated for the visible light absorption of the sulfur doped anatase TiO 2. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
