5|$|The committee's {{final report}} {{determined}} that along {{the whole of}} the rocky coast between Land's End and Hartland Point, Padstow was the only potentially safe harbour for the <b>coasting</b> trade when the most dangerous north-westerly onshore gales were blowing. It noted that Padstow's safety was compromised by the Doom Bar and by the eddy-forming effect of Stepper Point. The report recommended initial expenditure of £20,000 to cut down the outer part of Stepper Point, which, in conjunction with the capstans, bollards and mooring rings, would significantly reduce the risk to shipping.|$|E
5|$|About 257 seconds {{into the}} flight, {{the second stage}} cut off, and the rocket entered a coast phase to apogee. Immediately after cut-off, the second stage {{attitude}} control system was pressurised. During the coast the correct orientation for third stage separation was maintained {{by means of the}} attitude control system. Towards the end of the coast period, the third stage was spun up to a rate of 3hertz (180rpm) by means of six Imp rockets. Five seconds later, the third stage separated, and following ten more seconds of <b>coasting,</b> it ignited. The third stage was a Waxwing solid rocket motor, which burned for 55 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are relatively inefficient at converting on-board fuel energy to propulsion {{as most of}} the energy is wasted as heat, and the rest while the engine is idling. Electric motors, on the other hand, are more efficient at converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric drive vehicles do not consume energy while at rest or <b>coasting,</b> and modern plug-in cars can capture and reuse as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking through regenerative braking. Typically, conventional gasoline engines effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and diesel engines can reach on-board efficiencies of 20%, while electric drive vehicles typically have on-board efficiencies of around 80%.|$|E

5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} campaign he faced Republican nominee Sean Bielat, a technology executive {{and member of the}} U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. Bielat had run an unsuccessful campaign against Barney Frank in the 2010 election for the 4th district seat. In a series of debates, Bielat challenged Kennedy's qualifications for Congress, saying that the Democrat's campaign was <b>coasting</b> on name recognition rather than experience, and that he would be a party-line vote. Kennedy tried to tie Bielat to the budget platform of U.S. Representative Paul Ryan, although Bielat responded that he only supported parts of the plan. Kennedy raised over $4 million in support of his campaign, far exceeding Bielat's draw of around $900,000. Kennedy won the November 6 election with 61 percent of the vote to Bielat's 36 percent.|$|E
5|$|Willis had thus {{earned a}} second season at Surrey, and in 1970 played 14 Championship matches, taking 40 {{first-class}} wickets at 28.37, and 31 one day wickets at 14.65. Surrey came {{fifth in the}} Championship that year. He achieved a noteworthy performance in the Gillette Cup quarter-final against Middlesex. In a high-scoring match, Surrey made 280 {{for the loss of}} five wickets. Middlesex appeared to be <b>coasting</b> to victory when they reached 240–3, but Willis turned the game, and they collapsed and finished on 272–9. Willis took 6–49 in his 12 overs and won the Man of the Match award. Despite this, Surrey's preference for Geoff Arnold and Robin Jackman kept Willis out of the side on occasions. He prepared to spend the winter employed at the Crystal Palace Recreation Centre while playing as a goalkeeper for local football club Cobham. However, Ray Illingworth and Colin Cowdrey, captain and vice captain of England's Test side, contacted him via telephone to ask him to travel to Australia and join the current England tour there. Willis, who knew that Illingworth and Cowdrey had little knowledge of his bowling, later credited his call up to the influence of senior member of the touring party John Edrich, Willis' long-term friend, mentor and Surrey teammate.|$|E

25|$|In 1881 the Dunedin cable tramway system {{opened in}} Dunedin, New Zealand {{and became the}} first such system outside San Francisco. For Dunedin, George Smith Duncan further {{developed}} the Hallidie model, introducing the pull curve and the slot brake; the former was a way to pull cars through a curve, since Dunedin's curves were too sharp to allow <b>coasting,</b> while the latter forced a wedge down into the cable slot to stop the car. Both of these innovations were generally adopted by other cities, including San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|Track {{bicycles}} do {{not have}} brakes, because all riders ride {{in the same direction}} around a track which does not necessitate sharp deceleration. Track riders are still able to slow down because all track bicycles are fixed-gear, meaning that there is no freewheel. Without a freewheel, <b>coasting</b> is impossible, so when the rear wheel is moving, the cranks are moving. To slow down, the rider applies resistance to the pedals, acting as a braking system which can be as effective as a conventional rear wheel brake, but not as effective as a front wheel brake.|$|E
