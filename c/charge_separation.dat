5|$|If the {{electronic}} {{structure of the}} two interacting bodies {{is affected by the}} presence of one another, covalent interactions (non-ionic) also contribute to the overall energy of the compound formed. Ionic compounds are rarely purely ionic, i.e. held together only by electrostatic forces. The bonds between even the most electronegative/electropositive pairs such as those in caesium fluoride exhibit a small degree of covalency. Conversely, covalent bonds between unlike atoms often exhibit some <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> and can be considered to have a partial ionic character. The circumstances under which a compound will have ionic or covalent character can typically be understood using Fajans' rules, which use only charges and the sizes of each ion. According to these rules, compounds with the most ionic character will have large positive ions with a low charge, bonded to a small negative ion with a high charge. More generally HSAB theory can be applied, whereby the compounds with the most ionic character are those consisting of hard acids and hard bases: small, highly charged ions with a high difference in electronegativities between the anion and cation. This difference in electronegativities means that the <b>charge</b> <b>separation,</b> and resulting dipole moment, is maintained even when the ions are in contact (the excess electrons on the anions are not transferred or polarized to neutralize the cations).|$|E
25|$|Operation of a {{solar cell}} can be {{understood}} from the equivalent circuit at right. Light, of sufficient energy (greater than the bandgap of the material), creates mobile electron–hole pairs in a semiconductor. <b>Charge</b> <b>separation</b> occurs because of a pre-existing electric field associated with the p-n junction in thermal equilibrium (a contact potential creates the field). This <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> between positive holes and negative electrons across a p-n junction (a diode) yields a forward voltage, the photo voltage, between the illuminated diode terminals. As has been noted earlier in the terminology section, the photo voltage is {{sometimes referred to as}} the photo emf, rather than distinguishing between the effect and the cause. The <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> causes a photo voltage that drives current through any attached load.|$|E

40|$|Photosynthesis {{first step}} {{mechanism}} concerns the sunlight absorption and both {{negative and positive}} <b>charges</b> <b>separation.</b> Recent and important photosynthesis literature claims that this mechanism is quantum mechanics controlled, however without presenting qualitative or quantitative scientifically based mechanism. The present accepted and old-fashioned photosynthesis mechanism model suffers from few drawbacks and an important issue {{is the absence of}} driving force for negative and positive <b>charges</b> <b>separation.</b> This article presents a new qualitative model for this first step mechanism in natural catalytic systems such as photosynthesis in green leaves. The model uses a concept of semiconductor band gap engineering, such as the staggered energy band gap line-up in semiconductors. To explain the primary mechanism in natural photosynthesis the proposal is the following: incident light is absorbed inside the leaves causing <b>charges</b> <b>separation.</b> The only energetic configuration that allows <b>charges</b> <b>separation</b> under illumination is the staggered one between two materials or molecules. We explain why (e-, h+) interacting charges can be separated by using an energy staggered configuration, under illumination. Following this model, the green light of plants can be seen as related to the spent energy for <b>charges</b> <b>separation.</b> Green colour being mostly an emission and not a reflection as currently presented. The arguments mentioned below show why we cannot explain the photosynthesis first step mechanism, based on the presently accepted model, and therefore the alternative model is presented. Comment: In my opinion we can, finally, start to explain the most important physical mechanism on Earth (the first step for the photosynthesis process: sun light absorption and both (e- h+) <b>charges</b> <b>separation),</b> by using the energy staggered configuration between molecules...|$|R
40|$|To copy natural {{photosynthesis}} {{process we}} need to understand and explain the physics underneath its first step mechanism, which is “how to separate electrical charges under attraction”. But this Nature’s nanotechnological creation is not yet available to the scientific community. We present a new interpretation for the artificial and natural photosynthetic mechanism, concerning the electrical <b>charges</b> <b>separation</b> and the spent energy to promote the process. Interface (e–, h+) recombination and emission is applied to explain the photosynthetic mechanisms. This interpretation is based on energy bands relative position, the staggered one, which under illumination promotes (e–, h+) <b>charges</b> <b>separation</b> through the action of an interface electric field and energy consumption at the interface of both A/B generic materials. Energy band bending is responsible by the interface electric field (and the driving force) for the <b>charges</b> <b>separation.</b> This electric field can be as high or above that for p-n semiconductor junctions (10 4 - 10 5 V/cm). This physical effect is not considered by most of the researches. Without an electric field and without spending energy to separate electrical charges, any other existing model violates physical laws. The staggered energy band type is the only energetic configuration that permits <b>charges</b> <b>separation</b> under illumination and energy loss to perform the process. Application to natural photosynthesis and artificial photovoltaic material and their energetic configurations are discussed. Examples for A/B being III-V/III-V, TiO 2 /materials and II-VI/II-VI staggered energy band gap pairs are presented. In the proposed quantum mechanism, plants are able to eliminate most of the 79 % of the absorbed visible light, according to the published reflection and transmission data. Moreover, the proposed mechanism can be applied to explain green fluorescent protein - GFP, charge transfer states - CTS and Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer - FRET. As recent literature experimental results propose photosynthesis as a quantum controlled mechanism, our proposition goes forward this direction...|$|R

The HF method and the conventional correlation methods [MP 2, MP 4 (SDQ), CISD, and QCISD] yield distinct sets of LIs and DIs. Yet, within the four conventional correlation methods the differences in atomic populations and LIs and DIs are small. Relative to HF, the conventional correlation methods [MP 2, MP 4 (SDQ), CISD, QCISD] yield virtually the same LIs and DIs for molecules with large <b>charge</b> <b>separations</b> while LIs and DIs that differ significantly from the HF values—the LIs are increased and DIs decreased—are obtained for bonds with no or small <b>charge</b> <b>separations.</b> Such {{is the case in}} the archetypal homopolar molecules HC'CH, H 2 CACH 2, CH 3 OCH 3, and “protonated cyclopropane ” C 3 H 7, in which case the bonding may be atypical.

25|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanism of}} ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) generation in chloroplasts {{is similar to}} that in mitochondria and takes the required energy from the proton motive force (PMF). However, chloroplasts rely more on the chemical potential of the PMF to generate the potential energy required for ATP synthesis. The PMF is the sum of a proton chemical potential (given by the proton concentration gradient) and a transmembrane electrical potential (given by <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> across the membrane). Compared to the inner membranes of mitochondria, which have a significantly higher membrane potential due to <b>charge</b> <b>separation,</b> thylakoid membranes lack a charge gradient. To compensate for this, the 10,000 fold proton concentration gradient across the thylakoid membrane is much higher compared to a 10 fold gradient across the inner membrane of mitochondria. The resulting chemiosmotic potential between the lumen and stroma is high enough to drive ATP synthesis using the ATP synthase. As the protons travel back down the gradient through channels in ATP synthase, ADP + Pi are combined into ATP. In this manner, the light-dependent reactions are coupled to the synthesis of ATP via the proton gradient.|$|E

40|$|The self {{potential}} (SP) {{method is}} a simple and inexpensive geophysical surveying technique, which involves mea-suring electrical potentials on the surface due to <b>charge</b> <b>separations</b> in the subsurface. These <b>charge</b> <b>separations</b> can arise {{from a number of}} different physical and electrochemical processes, and hence interpretations tend to be quali-tative. Small anomalies are typically neglected as transient, inexplicable, or uninteresting. In contrast, large negative anomalies associated with ore bodies are noted for their constancy. In this study, an area on the campus of Memorial University was repeatedly surveyed in order to determine which natural and anthropogenic features generated SP anomalies, and whether these anomalies were constant or transient. We found anomalies associated with a building, a buried metallic pipe, trees, and subtler ground variations. The locations of anomalies, both large and small, were notably unvarying over a period of days and weeks. The building always generated a significant negative anomaly, but the sign of other anomalies (including that associated with the pipe) and the magnitude of all anomalies varied with time. In a second area dominated by a shallow sewer pipe, SP data allowed modeling of the burial depth and charge distribution of the pipe. Our results show that SP can be a useful and reliable method for shallow ground surveys, but that the time-varying nature of both sign and magnitude of small to moderate anomalies should be taken into account in data collection and interpretation...|$|R

The effect is most pronounced when the neutral object is an electrical conductor as the charges are more free to move around. Careful grounding of part of an object with a charge-induced <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> can permanently add or remove electrons, leaving the object with a global, permanent charge.

25|$|When solids of two {{different}} materials are in contact, thermodynamic equilibrium requires one of the solids assume a higher electrical potential than the other. This is called the contact potential. Dissimilar metals in contact produce what is known also as a contact electromotive force or Galvani potential. The magnitude of this potential difference is often expressed as a difference in Fermi levels in the two solids when they are at charge neutrality, where the Fermi level (a name for the chemical potential of an electron system) describes the energy necessary to remove an electron from the body to some common point (such as ground). If there is an energy advantage in taking an electron from one body to the other, such a transfer will occur. The transfer causes a <b>charge</b> <b>separation,</b> with one body gaining electrons and the other losing electrons. This charge transfer causes a potential difference between the bodies, which partly cancels the potential originating from the contact, and eventually equilibrium is reached. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the Fermi levels are equal (the electron removal energy is identical) and {{there is now a}} built-in electrostatic potential between the bodies.|$|E
