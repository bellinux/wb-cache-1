'This could be a recoverable injury, with a reasonable expectation he would survive,' Scalea said, noting that the assassin's weapon was relatively impotent compared to the firepower now on the streets today.|$|E
30|$|In medical specialties, {{multidisciplinary}} case conferences are conventional {{in hospital}} practice. Difficult cases can be dissected and differential diagnoses discussed. The original genre {{in this activity}} is the conventional <b>clinicopathological</b> <b>conference.</b> The New England Journal of Medicine offers the prototype case conference at the Massachusetts General Hospital {{on a weekly basis}} for many years. There is considerable variation amongst coroners in verdicts in the UK and consensus conferencing should be a routine service to coroners to try to decrease variation and increase accuracy (Tormey & Moore 2012 a).|$|E
40|$|The fifteenth {{quarterly}} <b>clinicopathological</b> <b>conference</b> {{was held}} at the Royal College of Physicians of London on 29 July 1976. The conference was chaired by Professor Sheila Sherlock (1). She began by introducing Professor Jean-Pierre Benhamou (2), professor of gastroenterology at the Beaujon-Clichy Hospital, University of Paris, who was to open the discussion of the case. Professor Sherlock emphasised that this case had no great dénouement but was more a talking point for various aspects of hepatology, a review {{of the state of the}} art. Dr James Scott (3) presented the case, and Dr R Dick (4) described the radiological findings...|$|E

40|$|The <b>clinicopathological</b> <b>conference,</b> {{popularly known}} as CPC {{primarily}} relies on case method of teaching medicine. It is a teaching tool that illustrates the logical, measured consideration of a differential diagnosis used to evaluate patients. The process involves case presentation, diagnostic data, discussion of differential diagnosis, logically narrowing the list to few selected probable diagnoses and eventually reaching a final diagnosis and its brief discussion. The idea was first practiced in Boston, back in 1900 by a Harvard internist, Dr. Richard C. Cabot who practiced this as an informal discussion session in his private office. Dr. Cabot incepted this from a resident, who in turn had received the idea from a roommate, primarily a law student...|$|E
40|$|A 35 -year-old {{lady was}} seen in the {{outpatient}} clinic owing to fever, cough with mucopurulent expectoration, and breathlessness for the duration of 1 month. She had history of similar episodes treated with antibiotics four times during last 2 years. There was no history of recurrent sinusitis, diarrhea, and skin or soft tissue infection. She had no history of diabetes mellitus or steroid intake. She denied any history of facial trauma or dental infection in the past. There was no history of tuberculosis in her or in the family. Radiograph and CT scan of the chest revealed right upper lobe consolidation. Flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy revealed multiple nodules at opening of right upper lobe bronchus.

40|$|We {{compare the}} {{diagnostic}} accuracy of three diagnostic inference models: the simple Bayes model, the multimembership Bayes model, which is isomorphic to the parallel combination {{function in the}} certainty-factor model, and a model that incorporates the noisy OR-gate interaction. The comparison is done on 20 <b>clinicopathological</b> <b>conference</b> (CPC) cases from the American Journal of Medicine—challenging cases describing actual patients often with multiple disorders. We find that the distributions produced by the noisy OR model agree most closely with the gold-standard diagnoses, although substantial differences exist between the distributions and the diagnoses. In addition, {{we find that the}} multimembership Bayes model tends to significantly overestimate the posterior probabilities of diseases, whereas the simple Bayes model tends to significantly underestimate the posterior probabilities. Our results suggest that additional work to refine the noisy OR model for internal medicine will be worthwhile. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduate and {{postgraduate}} health-care {{professional training}} and postdoctoral fellowship programs that deny trainees opportunities to practice both {{oral and written}} communication skills produce an incompletely trained health-care provider unable to compete for faculty positions at university hospitals and affiliated staffs. Therefore, {{it is imperative that}} program directors make medical writing a prerequisite to successful completion of postgraduate training programs. To make trainees as well as administrators and faculty {{aware of the importance of}} oral and written communication skills, a variety of oral abilities needed for presenting medical findings prior to publication are detailed. The use of 2 x 2 slides to support a presentation as well as transparencies, movies, and videotapes are considered. The poster session/scientific exhibit, now becoming more visible because of increasing attendance at professional meetings, is also explained. Written communication abilities are discussed. Consideration is given to the writing of professional manuscripts for publication in a refereed journal. Other types of written communication include case reports, <b>clinicopathological</b> <b>conferences,</b> letters to the editor, book reviews, books, and book contributions. The opportunity to learn needed skills must be offered in the postgraduate health-care curriculum. Mandatory medical writing will maximize the marketability of black health-care professionals for faculty staff placement. Moreover, the establishment of a "track record" early in a professional career will increase the likelihood that black health providers are awarded grants for research...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: Medical {{education}} has undergone substantial change in recent years, resulting in shorter, more compact courses that often contain much less pathology than previously. There {{has also been}} a concurrent decrease in the academic pathologist workforce in Australia, such that medical schools struggle to deliver even this reduced pathology curriculum. This paper reports the development and evaluation of an innovative approach in an undergraduate medical school to supporting pathology lectures, through integrating pathology with clinical medicine. METHODS: A series of 32 clinical pathological cases (CPCs) was developed to replicate <b>clinicopathological</b> <b>conferences</b> in a small group format. The CPCs were based on the pathology lectures, developed by a multidisciplinary clinical team and delivered to the students by clinical tutors. Students had access to learning support resources on the School's Intranet in both the main campus and rural teaching sites. Digitised pathology images, Web-based delivery and semi-guided learning issues are the main characteristics of the pathology module. The module was evaluated by a ranking system by the medical students for two consecutive years. RESULTS: In both years, the CPC module achieved a high score when compared with other components of the pathology curriculum. Positive feedback and frequent inquiries were also received about the module. CONCLUSION: The Web-based CPC modules provide an important resource that can facilitate teaching of pathology to medical students in the main campus and rural teaching sites. The module provides an opportunity to improve the profile of pathology in the medical school, {{in a manner that is}} sustainable with only one academic pathologist. It has the potential to be used nationally and internationally because of its multidisciplinary nature and the flexibility in its mode of delivery. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|I wrote a {{check this}} week. I do it yearly; this time, $ 169, for my annual {{subscription}} renewal to the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Writing this check {{reminds me of}} my dad… he started me on this tradition. During the autumn of my senior year in medical school I was approaching my 25 th birthday (1978) and my father asked if there was anything I “needed” for my birthday. My initial list was met with his comment that I didn’t need the items requested (new car, new stereo system, my own pair of new snow skis.) He was correct – I just wanted them. I then altered my approach, and told him that I really could use a subscription to the NEJM. After he heard my rationale, he started me off with my first issues: a 3 year subscription, at student rates, which I have renewed religiously… this will be my 35 th year! I love reading it. Filled with op-ed pieces on health care or global health issues, landmark original articles, review articles and of course the weekly mysterious <b>clinicopathological</b> <b>conference</b> (CPC) cases, it provides me an hour of broad medical education amidst the usual hectic work week. I recommend it to all physicians, and especially to all surgeons. I can’t tell you how much I have learned from this amazing journal on a year to year basis. A very belated thanks to my now departed father, for starting me on this weekly tradition. P. S. The NEJM is celebrating its 200 th birthday this year...|$|E
40|$|Le pretende mostrar el concepto "escuela" desde su origen etimológico y vincularlo a la dinámica de la historia como un concepto cambiante; relacionarlo con la historia del conocimiento y los cambios y rupturas que le son propios. Se avanza al concepto de escuela desde el espacio {{conceptual}} del mecanicismo, que pasa por las formulaciones de Newton, cuyo modelo del universo domina el pensamiento científico entre la mitad del siglo XVII y el final del siglo XIX, hasta {{llegar a}} la física moderna de Einstein, con el surgimiento de las teorías de la relatividad y la física cuántica. Mientras Einstein rompe con la visión mecanicista de la física Newtoniana del siglo XIX, la ciencia biomédica, a través de la educación, permanece atada a esa visión fragmentada de la realidad que ofrecen el síntoma y el órgano. Se describe el cambio de la escuela anatomoclínica a la escuela fisiopatológica en la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Antioquia. La Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Antioquia surgió en 1871 bajo el pénsum de la escuela anatomoclínica de París. Este modelo se extendió hasta 1940, cuando dio el "gran vuelco" hacia la medicina científica, con el laboratorio de anatomía patológica (1943) y el CPC (1944) creados por el Doctor Alfredo Correa Henao y con el desarrollo de la fisiología moderna de la mano de los doctores Alberto Saldarriaga, cirujano de la Escuela de Bernard y Leriche y Antonio Ramírez González. Se describen algunos trabajos realizados en el laboratorio de fisiología y cirugía experimental, donde se aplicaron metodologías empleadas en las escuelas alemana y norteamericana. This paper attempts {{to present the}} "school concept" from its etymological origin and to link it to the dynamics of history as an ever changing concept; also, to relate it {{to the history of}} knowledge, with its characteristic changes and ruptures. The "school concept" advances from the mechanistic space to Newton´s formulations, whose model of the universe dominated scientific thought between the middle of the XVII century {{and the end of the}} XIX century; then with Einstein´s modern physics and the relativity and quantic theories. Einstein broke up with the mechanistic Newtonian vision of the XIX century physics, but biomedical science, through education, remains anchored to the fragmentary vision of reality offered by symptoms and organs. The change from the anatomoclinical school to the physiopathological one at the Medical Faculty, University of Antioquia, is described. This Faculty dates back to 1871 and started under the influence of the anatomoclinical French model. It did not change until 1940; then there was a significant change to scientific medicine with the pathology laboratory (1943) and the <b>clinicopathological</b> <b>conference</b> (1944), both founded by doctor Alfredo Correa Henao. Also, with the development of modern physiology with doctor Alberto Saldarriaga, a surgeon from the school of Bernard and Leriche, and doctor Antonio Ramírez González, a physiologist from Louisville University (USA) and a chest surgeon from the United Kingdom. Some work carried out at the physiology and experimental surgery laboratories are described, in which both German and American methodologies were employed...|$|E
