60|$|This, however, we must {{reserve for}} our next paper--noticing here only that, however {{distinct}} the several {{branches of the}} subject are, radically, they are so interwoven in their issues that we cannot rightly treat any one, till we have taken cognizance of all. Thus the need of the currency in proportion to number of population is materially influenced by the probable number of the holders {{in proportion to the}} non-holders; and this again, by the number of holders of goods, or wealth, in proportion to the non-holders of goods. For as, by definition, the currency is a claim to goods which are not possessed, its quantity indicates the number of claimants in proportion to the number of holders; and the force and complexity of claim. For if the claims be not complex, currency as a means of exchange may be very small in quantity. A sells some corn to B, receiving a promise from B to pay in cattle, which A then hands over to C, to get some wine. C in due time claims the cattle from B; and B takes back his promise. These exchanges have, or might have been, all effected with a single coin or promise; and the proportion of the currency to the store would in such circumstances indicate only the circulating vitality of it--that is to say, the quantity and convenient divisibility of that part of the store which the habits of the nation keep in circulation. If a cattle breeder is content to live with his household chiefly on meat and milk, and does not want rich furniture, or jewels, or books--if a wine and <b>corn</b> <b>grower</b> maintains himself and his men chiefly on grapes and bread;--if the wives and daughters of families weave and spin the clothing of the household, and the nation, as a whole, remains content with the produce of its own soil and the work of its own hands, it has little occasion for circulating media. It pledges and promises little and seldom; exchanges only so far as exchange is necessary for life. The store belongs to the people in whose hands it is found, and money is little needed either as an expression of right, or practical means of division and exchange.|$|E

50|$|A Canadian urban {{farmer in}} British Columbia has {{published}} details on a crop value rating (CVR) system that urban farmers {{can use to}} determine which crops to grow, based on each crop's contribution to supporting the farm economically. This entails forgoing some crops in favor of others, but {{he points out that}} urban farmers can develop business networking with rural farmers to bring some of those other crops to the urban point of sale. For example, the urban farmer {{may not be able to}} economically justify growing sweet corn (based on long days to maturity and low yield density per linear foot of row), but a networking arrangement is mutually beneficial, as it lets a rural sweet <b>corn</b> <b>grower</b> gain an additional point of sale at retail price while also letting the urban farmer fill the gap in his produce line offering.|$|E

50|$|North Ridgeville {{is home to}} the North Ridgeville Corn Festival. The history {{started when}} the Bicentennial Committee for the City of North Ridgeville was formed in 1975 to {{celebrate}} the upcoming United States bicentennial in 1976. The first festival ran 6 hours and featured 13 booths around the North Ridgeville Middle School track. The proceeds were donated to the library to assist with the cost of relocating it from the old Lawson’s store area the Olde Town Hall building across the street. The next year, in 1976, in addition to celebrating the bicentennial, the festival was held in honor Harold Sweet, a sweet <b>corn</b> <b>grower</b> in North Ridgeville, for all that he did for the youth and citizens of the city. The proceeds from this festival were donated to purchase trees for the then new Bainbridge Extension along with 2 bicentennial flags for City Hall.

40|$|Germination {{tests of}} {{thousands}} of samples of the seed corn on Iowa farms indicate that {{a large percentage of}} it is unfit to plant, due to the various corn ear molds which were so common last fall, and principally to the dry rot of corn. It Is Important that seed corn be carefully examined and selected this spring, and ·then tested. Some of the diseased ears can be detected by examination alone, but not all. It is essential also to use the germination test to be wholly sure of good seed. Moldy corn was common In fields thruout the state last fall. In the central and eastern counties, from 2 to 15 percent of the ears were left in the field because of the mold, while many partially diseased ears found their way Into the seed corn.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to identify potential biomarkers for gut barrier failure in chickens. A total of 144 day-of-hatch Ross 308 male broiler chickens were housed in 24 battery cages with 6 chicks per cage. Cages were randomly assigned to either a control group (CON) or gut barrier failure (GBF) group. During the first 13 d, birds in CON or GBF groups were fed a common corn-soy starter diet. On d 14, CON chickens were switched to a <b>corn</b> <b>grower</b> diet and GBF chickens were switched to rye-wheat-barley grower diet. In addition, on d 21, GBF chickens were orally challenged with a coccidiosis vaccine. At d 21 and d 28, birds were weighed by cage and feed intake was recorded to calculate feed conversion ratio. At d 28, one chicken from each cage was euthanized to collect intestinal samples for morphometric analysis, blood for serum, and intestinal mucosa scrapings for gene expression. Overall performance and feed efficiency was severely affected (P < 0. 05) by a GBF model when compared with CON group at d 21 and d 28. Duodenum of GBF birds had wider villi, longer crypt depth, and higher crypt depth/villi height ratio than CON birds. Similarly, GBF birds had longer crypt depth in jejunum and ileum when compared with CON birds. An increase (P < 0. 05) in serum endotoxin, α 1 -acid glycoprotein (AGP), as well as interleukin (IL) - 8, IL- 1 β, transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 4 and fatty-acid-binding protein (FABP) 6 mRNA levels were increased in GBF birds compared to CON; however, FABP 2 mRNA levels were decreased (P < 0. 05) in GBF birds compared to CON. Occludin was numerically reduced by 24 % (P = 0. 107) and mucin 2 (MUC 2) was reduced by 29 % (P = 0. 088) in GBF birds compared to CON birds. The results from the present study suggest that serum endotoxin and AGP, as well as, gene expression of FABP 2, FABP 6, IL- 8, IL- 1 β and TGF-β 4 in mucosa may work as potential biomarkers for gut barrier health in chickens...|$|E
