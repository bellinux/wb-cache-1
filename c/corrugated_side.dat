40|$|We {{report an}} unusual {{morphology}} of ZnO nanowires with a hexagonal cross-section and <b>corrugated</b> <b>side</b> walls. Nanowires grow along the [0 0 0 1] direction and possess side walls built predominantly with facets of { 10 (1) over bar 1 } and { 10 (1) over bar(1) over bar} families. Such a morphology deviates dramatically from the well-known growth habit of ZnO nanowires that involves smooth side walls represented by { 10 (1) over bar 0 } or { 11 (2) over bar 0 } facets {{with the lowest}} surface energy. The formation of corrugated nanowires is attributed to the lateral growth activated by the high vapor supersaturation {{and the presence of}} stacking faults. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|ZnO {{nanostructures}} {{were obtained}} by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition via Ag catalyst-assisted growth in a temperature range of 200 - 500 degrees C. Growth at temperatures above 500 degrees C resulted in vertically aligned ZnO nanorods (NLs). Ag incorporation into ZnO up to 0. 4 at. % promoted creation of basal plane stacking fault (BSF) defects and corrugation of the side facets of the NLs. The presence of BSFs give rise to an additional photoluminescence peak with a wavelength of similar to 386 nm, which is slightly red-shifted compared to the commonly observed NBE emission at similar to 375 nm. The observed emission {{was found to be}} specifically observed from the side facets of the NLs. It is suggested that this emission is due to a high concentration of BSFs in the ZnO {{as a result of an}} incorporation of Ag as acceptor dopant.

The South Australian Railways broad gauge system had been extended north in 1937 to meet a southern extension from Port Augusta on the Commonwealth Railways' standard gauge system, creating Port Pirie as a break-of-gauge and transshipment point. To encourage passengers to use the line despite the inconvenience of changing trains, in 1947 the Cafeteria Car was constructed and used on the services to and from Adelaide, in conjunction with the mid-1930s Steel carriage fleet. In 1964 the first airconditioned sitting cars entered regular service on the East-West Express, and construction of those continued through to 1967 with a total of nine sitting cars and fourteen vans.|$|R
