25|$|The {{late medieval}} German school survives into the German Renaissance, {{and there are}} a number of printed 16th-century manuals (notably the one by Joachim Meyer, 1570).

25|$|The {{process of}} Standardization often {{involves}} one variety {{of a language}} taking precedence over other social and regional dialects of a language.

If one variety of a language is chosen, that variety <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> understood as supra-dialectal and the ‘best’ form of the language.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue of}} a court {{descending}} into the arena and depriving a party {{of the right to}} a fair trial was also distinguished from that of prejudgment, as in Roseli bin Amat v. Public Prosecutor (1989). When a judge is found to have prejudged, he will not have an open mind and is likely to have determined issues adversely against a party before the presentation of a case. However, when he descends into the arena, he may not necessarily have taken sides before the hearing. The difference may lie in how actively the judge pursues this position and how he <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> persuaded.|$|E

25|$|Wanting {{to bring}} in Christian mythology to the series, the writers created the angel Castiel. With Kripke wanting to keep the {{introduction}} of an angel a secret, the character was instead described as a demon during auditions. Misha Collins was cast as the character. Making his debut in the fourth-season premiere, Castiel resurrects Dean from Hell {{after his death in}} the third season, and <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an ally of the Winchesters. The character was originally intended for only a six-episode story arc, but the role was later expanded. Collins was promoted to a series regular for the fifth and sixth season, something Collins believes to be mainly due to fan support. Collins was downgraded to recurring status for the seventh and eighth seasons, but returned to series regular status for seasons nine and ten.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{she argues}} for an ethics based {{precisely}} on {{the limits of}} self-knowledge as the limits of responsibility itself. Any concept of responsibility which demands the full transparency of the self to itself, an entirely accountable self, necessarily does violence to the opacity which marks {{the constitution of the}} self it addresses. The scene of address by which responsibility is enabled is always already a relation between subjects who are variably opaque to themselves and to each other. The ethics that Butler envisions is therefore one in which the responsible self knows the limits of its knowing, recognizes the limits of its capacity to give an account of itself to others, and respects those limits as symptomatically human. To take seriously one's opacity to oneself in ethical deliberation means then to critically interrogate the social world in which one <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> human {{in the first place and}} which remains precisely that which one cannot know about oneself. In this way, Butler locates social and political critique at the core of ethical practice.|$|E
500|$|The Tunnel (...) is a British-French crime drama {{television}} series, {{adapted from}} the 2011 Danish/Swedish crime series The Bridge (Broen/Bron). The Tunnel began broadcast on 16 October 2013 on Sky Atlantic in the UK, and on 11 November 2013 on Canal+ in France. The series stars Stephen Dillane and Clémence Poésy as British and French police detectives Karl Roebuck and Elise Wassermann, respectively. The plot follows the two detectives working together to find a serial killer who left the upper-half body of a French politician and the lower-half of a British prostitute in the Channel Tunnel, at the midpoint between France and the UK. They later learn that the killer – who <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nicknamed the [...] "Truth Terrorist" [...] – is on a moral crusade to highlight many social problems, terrorising both countries in the process.

However, in the episode [...] "Project 90", reference is made to the BIG RAT being documented in WIN's [...] "File Number 90", from which Joe's designation is explicitly stated to originate.
