5|$|The first <b>cannon</b> {{appeared}} in Russia in the 1370-1380s, although initially their use {{was confined to}} sieges and the defence of fortresses. The first mention of <b>cannon</b> in Russian chronicles is of tyufyaks, small howitzer-type <b>cannon</b> that fired case-shot, used to defend Moscow against Tokhtamysh Khan in 1382. <b>Cannon</b> co-existed with throwing-machines until the mid-15th century, when they overtook the latter in terms of destructive power. In 1446, a Russian city fell to <b>cannon</b> fire for the first time, although its wall was not destroyed. However {{it was not until}} 1475, when Ivan III established the first Russian <b>cannon</b> foundry in Moscow, which {{was the beginning of the}} native <b>cannon</b> production industry. The first stone wall to be destroyed in Russia by <b>cannon</b> fire came in 1481.|$|E

50|$|The manager Lars Semb started casting 3-pound and 6-pound <b>cannons</b> {{during the}} autumn of 1807 and during the winter the blast {{furnaces}} were renovated so that casting of large 24-pound <b>cannons</b> for sjøetaten (shore artillery) could begin in February. There was also a demand for <b>cannons</b> for vessels built for privateer's, the privateer vessel Christiania received 2 6-pound <b>cannons,</b> 5 12-pound <b>cannons</b> and 4 18-pound carronades. It was also cast 18-pound <b>cannons</b> for landetaten (the army), among the fortifications who acquired those guns were Slevik in Onsøy.|$|R
5|$|By the 1350s the <b>cannon</b> {{was used}} {{extensively}} in Chinese warfare. In 1358 the Ming army {{failed to take}} a city due to its garrisons' usage of <b>cannon,</b> however they themselves would use <b>cannon</b> in the thousands later on during the siege of Suzhou in 1366.|$|E
5|$|Caltech {{is home to}} the 1.7-ton, 130-year-old Fleming <b>Cannon.</b> The {{origins and}} exact age of the Fleming <b>Cannon</b> are not known with certainty. It is {{believed}} to have been cast during the Franco-Prussian War era, but completed in 1878 after the war was over. It was then given by the French to the United States where it was re-bored to fit American shells and the carriage constructed, but this work was completed too late for it to see use in the Spanish–American War. The <b>cannon</b> soon became obsolete and was donated to Southwestern Academy in San Marino, California, where it was displayed on the front lawn starting in 1925. By 1972, the school was seeking to discard the <b>cannon,</b> and a group of Caltech students from Fleming House took possession of the <b>cannon</b> and laboriously restored it to working condition. The <b>cannon</b> was returned to Southwestern in 1975 at the insistence of the Caltech administration, but it was permanently restored to Caltech in 1981. The <b>cannon</b> is one of the few objects at Caltech which is designated as unprankable given its age, fragility, and irreplaceable nature.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cannon</b> {{in general}} have {{the form of}} a {{truncated}} cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding an explosive charge and a projectile. The thickest, strongest, and closed part of the cone is located near the explosive charge. As any explosive charge will dissipate in all directions equally, the thickest portion of the <b>cannon</b> is useful for containing and directing this force. The backward motion of the <b>cannon</b> as its projectile leaves the bore is termed its recoil and the effectiveness of the <b>cannon</b> can be measured in terms of how much this response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing the overall mass of the <b>cannon</b> means decreased mobility.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cannon</b> sounds have {{sometimes}} {{been used in}} classical pieces with a military theme. One {{of the best known}} examples of such a piece is Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. The overture is to be performed using an artillery section together with the orchestra, resulting in noise levels high enough that musicians are required to wear ear protection. The <b>cannon</b> fire simulates Russian artillery bombardments of the Battle of Borodino, a critical battle in Napoleon's invasion of Russia, whose defeat the piece celebrates. When the overture was first performed, the <b>cannon</b> were fired by an electric current triggered by the conductor. However, the overture was not recorded with real <b>cannon</b> fire until Mercury Records and conductor Antal Doráti's 1958 recording of the Minnesota Orchestra. <b>Cannon</b> fire is also frequently used annually in presentations of the 1812 on the American Independence Day, a tradition started by Arthur Fiedler of the Boston Pops in 1974.|$|E

5|$|Cannon: The {{earliest}} known {{depiction of}} a <b>cannon</b> is a sculpture from the Dazu Rock Carvings in Sichuan dated to 1128, however the earliest archaeological samples and textual accounts do not appear until the 13th century. The primary extant specimens of <b>cannon</b> from the 13th century are the Wuwei Bronze <b>Cannon</b> dated to 1227, the Heilongjiang hand <b>cannon</b> dated to 1288, and the Xanadu Gun dated to 1298. However, only the Xanadu gun contains an inscription bearing a date of production, so it is considered the earliest confirmed extant <b>cannon.</b> The Xanadu Gun is 34.7cm in length and weighs 6.2kg. The other <b>cannon</b> are dated using contextual evidence.|$|E
5|$|Documentary {{evidence}} of <b>cannon</b> in Russia {{does not appear}} until 1382 and they were used only in sieges, often by the defenders. It was not until 1475 when Ivan III established the first Russian <b>cannon</b> foundry in Moscow that they began to produce <b>cannon</b> natively.|$|E

50|$|Moss Jernverk {{manufactured}} <b>cannons</b> up to 36-pound size, {{but also}} 1/8-pound, which was considered toys. In 1789 there were suspicions regarding 18-pound and 12-pound cannons' quality - test firing {{confirmed that the}} <b>cannons</b> were inadequate. This resulted in the state changing to Swedish iron works for purchasing <b>cannons,</b> with the imminent result that the <b>cannons</b> from Moss were eventually phased out. As late as during the First Schleswig War (1848-1850) the fortress at Fredericia in Denmark was defended with <b>cannons</b> from Moss Jernverk.|$|R
5|$|However, it {{was soon}} {{revealed}} that the <b>cannon</b> had been appropriated by MIT {{in retaliation for the}} previous year's pranks, and relocated to Cambridge. The MIT team consisted of about 30 hackers, of which two flew to Pasadena and five drove cross-country. While acquiring the <b>cannon</b> disguised as construction contractors, the hackers had run-ins with a Caltech security guard and physical plant worker, to whom they explained that they were moving the <b>cannon</b> in preparation for the pouring of a concrete pedestal. Once off Caltech's campus, a local resident called in a noise complaint, and the Pasadena police arrived but did not recognize the then-disguised <b>cannon.</b> On the way to the shipping company, the trailer's hitch cracked, necessitating a slow trip on surface roads, and on arrival they were unable to physically remove the <b>cannon</b> from the trailer, causing them to spend an extra $1000 for the services of a company that specialized in moving large film props.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, a {{modernization}} program was announced. Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems {{was chosen to}} provide 3-axis gyro-stabilization, and most probably the L7A2 105 mm <b>cannon</b> will be replaced with a more powerful 120mm <b>cannon,</b> like the L44 120 mm <b>Cannon.</b> The first TAM unit upgraded by Elbit Systems was delivered in March 2013.|$|E
5|$|In the 1770s, <b>cannon</b> {{operation}} {{worked as}} follows: each <b>cannon</b> would be manned by two gunners, six soldiers, and four officers of artillery. The right gunner was to prime the piece and load it with powder, {{and the left}} gunner would fetch the powder from the magazine {{and be ready to}} fire the <b>cannon</b> at the officer's command. On each side of the <b>cannon,</b> three soldiers stood, to ram and sponge the <b>cannon,</b> and hold the ladle. The second soldier on the left tasked with providing 50 bullets.|$|E

Mons Meg, which dates from about the same time, is perhaps the most famous example of a Scottish <b>cannon.</b> James IV was Scotland's first Renaissance figure, who also had a fascination with <b>cannon,</b> both at land and at sea. By 1502, he was able to invest in a Scottish navy, which was to have a large number of <b>cannon</b> — his flagship, the Great Michael, was launched in 1511, with 36 great guns, 300 lesser pieces and 120 gunners.|$|E
