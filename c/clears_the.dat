5|$|The ruling <b>clears</b> <b>the</b> {{way for the}} plaintiff-respondents {{to collect}} from the roughly $1.75billion bank account, which {{will be enough to}} satisfy about 70% of their {{collective}} $2.5billion in judgments. They will not be eligible to collect from a $1billion fund—the Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund—established by Congress in 2015 to pay victims of state-sponsored terrorism. That fund pays 30% of judgments until all applicants have received that amount; remaining funds will not be distributed until all claimants have received 30% of their judgment.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 11, the Hassayampa Freeway, is a {{proposed}} Interstate Highway in the United States {{to run from}} Casa Grande, Arizona Northwest to Las Vegas, Nevada by way of Kingman, Arizona. The highway will parallel and/or upgrade existing U.S. 93 north of Wickenburg, Arizona; south of Wickenburg, it will follow a new freeway near the Hassayampa River, turning Southeast near southern Goodyear, through Casa Grande and Interstate 10, and to its terminus with intersection of the proposed Pinal North-South Freeway near Coolidge, AZ. Interstate 11 {{is part of a}} long-range vision for the Valley's future transportation needs, as defined by the Maricopa Association of Governments and ADOT. Interstate 11 was approved June 30, 2012 as part of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act. In June 2013, a joint draft study commissioned by the respective DOTs of Arizona and Nevada concluded that the freeway was justified, citing benefits in travel, tourism, trade, and economic growth. The conclusion of the study further <b>clears</b> <b>the</b> way for Interstate 11's funding and implementation.|$|E
5|$|Amy starts {{working for}} Leyla and {{develops}} feelings for David, who pays her attention. Amy sleeps with Cain {{and tries to}} make David jealous. When Alicia steals £500 worth of stock, Leyla accuses Amy but David defends her and Alicia admits it was her. Amy kisses David on the cheek {{to thank him for}} his support and misinterpreting his concern, makes further advances but runs away after David rejects her. When she comes home, she blackmails David and tells Victoria that she slept with him but later admits that she lied. Amy, Val and Eric move into their new home at the barn conversion but her happiness is short-lived as a young man from her past, Jared, tracks her down. He threatens to tell her new family and friends about her past and demands money to keep quiet until Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell) intervenes, realizing something is wrong. She tells Zak about her past and makes him promise to keep quiet. She pays Jared but when threatened by Zak, he reveals that Amy's affair with his father caused his family to break down. Zak makes Jared leave but Amy discovers she is pregnant and tells Cain, who demands she have a termination. Victoria suggests Amy tell Val but at the clinic, learns that her pregnancy is too advanced for a termination and the baby is due in December. She tells Belle Dingle (Eden Taylor-Draper) about the baby but insists that Belle keep it secret, scared of Cain's reaction. Amy gives birth to a baby boy in the church graveyard. Thinking he is dead, Amy wraps him in her jumper before leaving him in a telephone box and goes to David's house. She tells him what has happened and he learns that the baby has been found alive and taken to hospital. Knowing Amy needs medical attention, he waits for her to fall asleep and calls an ambulance, Val and Eric. At the hospital, she apologizes for keeping her pregnancy a secret and initially decides to keep the baby, now named Kyle, delighting Val and Eric. On Christmas Day 2011, Amy is bathing Kyle but freezes when she remembers her mother dropping her in the bath and giving her to social services. Amy runs away, leaving Kyle with Val, and confides in Victoria who helps her decide to give Kyle up for adoption. Val is upset by Amy's decision and that Eric is supporting her, making them drift apart. Val tries to win Amy back with a family trip to Portugal but goes alone and <b>clears</b> <b>the</b> bank account. Amy is upset when Eric begins dating Brenda Walker (Lesley Dunlop) and attempts to keep them apart; however, she realizes how happy Brenda makes Eric and supports the relationship.|$|E

25|$|The WHO has {{recommended}} artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) be the first-line therapy for P. falciparum malaria worldwide.

The buoyancy of the board will then push the boom upward, helping to lift the sail out of the water.|$|E
25|$|An {{extensively}} documented case of coevolution is {{the relationship}} between Pseudomyrmex, a type of ant, and the acacia, a plant that the ant uses for food and shelter.
