50|$|The {{science of}} {{shoveling}} is, hand shoveling {{has long since}} mostly faded out of commercial concern thanks to extensive mechanization, such as bulldozers and other equipment. Humans are once again mostly content to let one <b>coal</b> <b>scoop</b> handle various bulk materials of differing densities.|$|E
50|$|The {{gauge glass}} on a boiler {{needs to be}} {{inspected}} periodically and replaced if it is seen to have worn thin {{in the vicinity of}} the gland nuts, but a failure in service can still occur. Drivers are expected to carry two or three glass tubes, pre-cut to the required length, together with hemp or rubber seals, to replace the tubes on the road. Familiarity with this disquieting occurrence was considered so important that a glass would often be smashed deliberately while a trainee driver was on the footplate, to give him practice in fitting a new tube. Although automatic ball valves are fitted in the mounts to limit the release of steam and scalding water, these can fail through accumulation of limescale. It was standard procedure to hold the <b>coal</b> <b>scoop</b> in front of the face while the other hand, holding the cap for protection, reached to turn off the valves at both ends of the glass.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the schoolhouse is furnished with pieces from the 1870s, including the iron worked legs on the oak-top school desks and the large potbelly stove {{in the center of}} the room. The <b>coal</b> bucket and <b>scoop</b> are located close to the stove. The teachers desk is located on a dais with a large blackboard behind the teachers desk.|$|R
