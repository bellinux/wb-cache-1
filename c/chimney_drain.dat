40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the performance of geogrid reinforced soil walls with panel facing using marginal backfill with and without chimney sand drain subjected to seepage. A series of centrifuge model tests were performed at 40 gravities using a 4. 5 m radius large beam centrifuge facility available at IIT Bombay. The results revealed that a geogrid reinforced soil wall with low stiffness geogrid and without any <b>chimney</b> <b>drain</b> experienced a catastrophic failure due to excess pore water pressure that developed in the reinforced and backfill zones at the onset of seepage. In comparison, a soil wall reinforced with stiff geogrid layers was found to perform effectively even at the onset of seepage. Provision of chimney sand drain effectively decreased pore water pressure not only at the wall toe but also at mid distance from toe of the wall and thereby resulted in enhancing the wall performance under the effect of seepage forces. However, a local piping failure was observed near the toe region of the wall. The observed centrifuge test results were further analysed by performing seepage and stability analyses to evaluate the effect of thickness of sand layer in a <b>chimney</b> <b>drain.</b> An increase in thickness of sand layer in <b>chimney</b> <b>drain</b> was found to improve the discharge values and thereby enhancing the factor of safety against piping near the toe region. Based on the analysis and interpretation of centrifuge test results, it can be concluded that marginal soil can be used as a backfill in reinforced soil walls provided, it has geogrid layers of adequate stiffness and/or proper <b>chimney</b> <b>drain</b> configuration.

40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} interprets the {{monitoring}} information collected from Hays Creek Dam since its upgrade in 1994. The upgrade involved the retrofitting of a continuous 800 mm wide well graded sand <b>chimney</b> <b>drain</b> from abutment to abutment in the downstream {{edge of the}} clay core of the dam, using a revertible bio-ploymer. Since this upgrade, the safety and performance of this water supply dam has improved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} a homogenous earth dam. The work is focused to the search of solutions of problems encountered in the earth dams after their construction. One of the major problems is the choice and design of systems of drainage. The effective drainage system to prevent harmful accumulations of excess water {{is one of the}} most important roles of dams. Efficient drainage systems can improve the safety of earth dams. The paper presented herein reports the results obtained from the experimental study. Empiric relations have been obtained which can be help in the control of the flow rate in the <b>chimney</b> <b>drain</b> of the earth dams on pervious foundation, which can increase safety earth dams. Water is essential for life on our planet and dams are constructed for the purpose of this matter conservation; all earth and rock-fill dams are generally built of locally available materials in their natural state with a minimum of processing and they are subject to seepage through the embankment, foundation, and abutments; therefore we devoted this study to the search of solution...|$|E

5000|$|Central City Stone Works was {{established}} by Bassett Brothers in 1864. They were succeeded by M. G. Fields & Company in 1867 who expanded the firm and opened a manufacturing facility on January 15, 1877. The company produced goods from English imported Portland Cement such as <b>chimney,</b> well, <b>drain,</b> sewer and culvert pipe. They also manufactured ornamental building stone, step stone and cement sidewalks, lawn vases [...] "of which there are many samples in our local parks and cemeteries." [...] The company office and works were located on South Onondaga Street and the branch office was located at James Finegan's Stone Yard {{on the corner of}} Olive and Fulton Streets. They were known as Central City Pipe Works by 1884 and were located at 51 West Railroad street and were producing miscellaneous types of pipes such as cement, sewer, <b>drain,</b> <b>chimney</b> and well pipes.|$|R
2500|$|A {{chimney cowl}} {{is placed on}} top of the chimney to prevent birds and other animals from nesting in the chimney. [...] They often feature a rain guard to prevent rain or snow from going down the chimney. [...] A metal wire mesh is often used as a spark {{arrestor}} to minimize burning debris from rising out of the chimney and making it onto the roof. Although the masonry inside the chimney can absorb a large amount of moisture which later evaporates, rainwater can collect {{at the base of the}} chimney. Sometimes weep holes are placed at the bottom of the <b>chimney</b> to <b>drain</b> out collected water.|$|R
40|$|The {{rehabilitation}} of small dams often requires the reduction or control of groundwater seepage through or under earthen dams. The slurry trench method {{is well known}} for creating impermeable groundwater barriers and has been used for decades to create economical and positive cutoff walls in the core or foundation soils beneath dams and dikes of many types and sizes. This paper examines three innovative modifications of the slurry trench method and their applications in the {{rehabilitation of}} three small dams. Case histories of each dam and slurry trench method are described. The slurry trench technique uses an engineered fluid for support of trench walls. Usually the fluid is bentonite slurry that coats the trench walls and permanently blocks the free flow of water. If, however, the fluid is degradable, a permeable backfill, such as sand or gravel can be backfilled in the trench to create a permeable zone such as a toe drain or <b>chimney</b> <b>drain.</b> This method is known as the bio-polymer trench drain method and has been used {{for more than a decade}} in the waste remediation industry to collect contaminated groundwater, and more recently in the rehabilitation of dams. A case study is presented of a small dam i...|$|E

Among the provisions, builders {{were required to}} give the district surveyor two days' notice before building, regulations regarding the thickness of walls, height of rooms, the materials used in repairs, the dividing of existing buildings and the placing and design of <b>chimneys,</b> fireplaces and <b>drains</b> were to be enforced and streets had to be built to minimum requirements.|$|R

The torpedo was standardized to consist {{of a number of}} externally identical 1.5 m lengths of threaded pipe, one of which contained the explosive charge. The pipes would be screwed together using connecting sleeves to make a longer pipe of the required length, somewhat like a <b>chimney</b> brush or <b>drain</b> clearing rod.|$|R
5000|$|Chabrouh dam {{is located}} on Wadi Chabrouh river in Faraya, about 40 km {{north-east}} of Beirut. This project will provide potable water during the summer for Kesrouan region (around 250,000 inhabitants). The dam is a bituminous face rockfill dam (BFRD), with maximum height of 65m, crest length of 470m at 1618m above sea level and a volume of rockfill of 1,500,000 m3. The upstream and downstream slopes are 1V:1.7H. The upstream bituminous slab has a total area of 37,000 m2 and total thickness of 22 cm (2 layers of 6 cm and a base of 10 cm).The embankment is divided into eight zones of materials as well as filters and drains. The rockfill for the embankment is selected from two quarries at about 5 km from the dam site. Zone I (1800-1860) {{is a mixture of}} hard limestone (above 1840) and chalky limestone (Average Los Angeles 50) used for embankment material 3B and 3BE (see figure 2.2). Zone II is a formation of very hard limestone (Average Los Angeles 25) used for concrete aggregates and materials 2A, 2B, 3A, 4 and draining systems (see figure 2.3). The test layers performed with fill material 3B, showed that after compaction, the percentage of fines was greater than expected with Kh/Kv =100. These results led to the implementation of a <b>draining</b> <b>chimney</b> located at 45 m from the upstream face of the embankment, aiming at controlling all potential leakages, and channelling the water towards the horizontal drains of the embankment.The construction of the dam was done in phases taking into consideration the fact that the site was covered with snow during at least 4 months of the year. The deviation of the water course was delayed in order to finish the deviation tunnel. Meanwhile, the works were taking place on the left and right banks separately ...|$|R
