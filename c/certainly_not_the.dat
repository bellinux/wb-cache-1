5|$|Two {{days after}} Henry's coronation, he arrested his father's two most unpopular ministers, Sir Richard Empson and Edmund Dudley. They {{were charged with}} high treason and were {{executed}} in 1510. Historian Ian Crofton has maintained that such executions would become Henry's primary tactic for dealing with those who stood in his way; the two executions were <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> last. Henry also returned to the public {{some of the money}} supposedly extorted by the two ministers. By contrast, Henry's view of the House of York – potential rival claimants for the throne – was more moderate than his father's had been. Several who had been imprisoned by his father, including the Marquess of Dorset, were pardoned. Others (most notably Edmund de la Pole) went unreconciled; de la Pole was eventually beheaded in 1513, an execution prompted by his brother Richard siding against the king.|$|E
25|$|The Denmark Vesey House in Charleston, {{although}} almost <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> actual home of Vesey, {{was designated}} National Historic Landmark in 1976 by the Department of Interior.|$|E
25|$|By 1801, Macarthur was {{the largest}} sheep rearer in the colony, {{although}} he was <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only landowner to have experimented with the breeding of fine-wooled sheep. As late as July 1800, {{there is no evidence}} of any 'prophetic word' from Macarthur about the future of Spanish wool: at that time he was considering selling his entire flock.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the context}} of early 19th century America, the First Vision was <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only charismatic {{experience}} to be recorded. There are records of others of the day who had similar visions {{in which they were}} told that all churches were corrupt; however, the sectarian clergy vigorously opposed such visions, as Smith reports they did of his own vision.|$|E
25|$|Rabbits are {{famed for}} their {{reproductive}} capabilities. Although <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> strongest, fastest, or smartest of the mammals, they have {{carved out a}} strong ecological niche through their rate of impregnation, because female rabbits ovulate {{at the time of}} copulation. One striking example of rapid rabbit reproduction took place in Australia, where the first 24 rabbits introduced in 1859 had multiplied to form a population of over 600 million over the course of less than a century.|$|E
25|$|Next, Matthews {{appeared}} in public in 1921 and {{claimed to have}} invented the world's first talking picture, a farewell interview of Ernest Shackleton recorded on 16 September 1921, shortly before Shakleton's last expedition. The film was not commercially successful. Other talking-picture processes had been developed before that of Matthews, including processes by William K. L. Dickson, Photokinema (Orlando Kellum), and Phonofilm (Lee DeForest). However, Matthews claimed his process was the first sound-on-film process. Even if Matthews's process actually worked, it was <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> first.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the reasons}} cited for banning capital {{punishment}} in Canada were fears about wrongful convictions, {{concerns about the}} state taking people's lives, and uncertainty about the death penalty's role as a deterrent for crime. The 1959 conviction of 14-year-old Steven Truscott was a significant impetus (although <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only one) toward the abolition of capital punishment. Truscott {{was sentenced to death}} for the murder of a classmate. His sentence was later commuted to a life sentence and in 2007 he was acquitted of the charges (although the appeal court did not state that he was in fact innocent).|$|E
25|$|When Benaud won the toss on a {{pitch that}} looked rather inanimate {{most of us}} thought that Australia would {{probably}} get about 500 runs against an English attack which {{for the most part}} was devoid of fire, venom and guile. Previous matches had shown that the off-spinners might toil and spin but that they could not turn. Knight, always short of a length, should not on a good pitch worry any batsmen of even average class. Statham had seemed rather lethargic: <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> Statham of other years... Thinking over the game later on, one wondered how this bowling on a dead pitch succeeded in dismissing Australia for 404 runs.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, the Canadian Pacific Railway built a {{log cabin}} lodge {{for the use of}} The Trail Riders of the Canadian Rockies, a club of horse enthusiasts who were {{sponsored}} by the tourist friendly railway. This cabin was <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> first lodge built in the region (Bill Peyto’s cabin near Simpson’s pass was built more than 30 years earlier), but it is now the oldest building at Sunshine Village and is known as the Old Sunshine Lodge. Housing Mad Trapper's Saloon and Bruno's Bistro, the OSL is situated at the timberline above what was then known as Wheeler’s Flats and just below a vast expanse of high alpine meadows.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{the neural}} {{connections}} of the receptors, the optical system is an equally {{key player in}} retinal resolution. In the ideal eye, {{the image of a}} diffraction grating can subtend 0.5 micrometre on the retina. This is <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case, however, and furthermore the pupil can cause diffraction of the light. Thus, black lines on a grating will be mixed with the intervening white lines to make a gray appearance. Defective optical issues (such as uncorrected myopia) can render it worse, but suitable lenses can help. Images (such as gratings) can be sharpened by lateral inhibition, i.e., more highly excited cells inhibiting the less excited cells. A similar reaction is in the case of chromatic aberrations, in which the color fringes around black-and-white objects are inhibited similarly.|$|E
25|$|The Dacians {{knew about}} writing. Permanent {{contacts}} with the Graeco-Roman world had brought {{the use of the}} Greek and later the Latin alphabet. It is also <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case that writing with Greek and Latin letters and knowledge of Greek and Latin were known in all the settlements scattered throughout Dacia, but {{there is no doubt about}} the existence of such knowledge in some circles of Dacian society. However, the most revealing discoveries concerning the use of the writing by the Dacians occurred in the citadels on the Sebes mountains. Some groups of letters from stone blocks at Sarmisegetuza might express personal names; these can not now be read because the wall is ruined, and because it is impossible to restore the original order of the blocks in the wall.|$|E
25|$|Only a {{few more}} settings, {{completing}} {{the first half of}} the Italienisches Liederbuch, were composed in 1891 before Wolf's mental and physical health once again took a downturn at the end of the year; exhaustion from his prolific past few years combined with the effects of syphilis and his depressive temperament caused him to stop composing for the next several years. Continuing concerts of his works in Austria and Germany spread his growing fame; even Brahms and the critics who had previously reviled Wolf gave favorable reviews. However, Wolf was consumed with depression, which stopped him from writing—which only left him more depressed. He completed orchestrations of previous works, but new compositions were not forthcoming, and <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> opera which he was now fixated on composing, still convinced that success in the larger forms was the mark of compositional greatness.|$|E

25|$|The Qing dynasty (1644–1911) {{was founded}} by the Manchu clan Aisin Gioro in what is today Northeast China (also known as Manchuria). They were <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> first non-Han people to rule all of China, but the fate of these {{previous}} dynasties {{had always been the}} same: they invaded; they governed; they intermarried; and eventually they merged, more or less becoming Chinese themselves. Attempts were made to keep the Manchu strain ethnically pure, although these efforts proved fruitless. The early Manchu rulers enacted various laws to isolate Manchuria from China proper (Eighteen Provinces) and Mongolia. They did the same for the Mongols: Han Chinese were prohibited from entering Mongolia and Mongols were not allowed to travel outside their own leagues. Mongols were forbidden from speaking Chinese languages or intermarrying with the Han Chinese. While over time enforcement waned, the laws still remained on the books, receiving at least token observance.|$|E
25|$|The Sanjan Zoroastrians were <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> first Zoroastrians on the subcontinent. Sindh {{touching}} Balochistan, the easternmost {{periphery of}} the Iranian world, too had once been under coastal administration of the Sasanian Empire (226-651), which consequently maintained outposts there. Even following the loss of Sindh, the Iranians continued {{to play a major}} role in the trade links between the east and west. The 9th-century Arab historiographer Al-Masudi briefly notes Zoroastrians with fire temples in al-Hind and in al-Sindh, Moreover, for the Iranians, the harbors of Gujarat lay on the maritime routes that complemented the overland Silk Road and there were extensive trade relations between the two regions. The contact between Iranians and Indians was already well established even prior to the Common Era, and both the Puranas and the Mahabharata use the term Parasikas to refer to the peoples west of the Indus River.|$|E
500|$|The music {{historian}} Roger Parker {{points out}} that both of Verdi's parents [...] "belonged to families of small landowners and traders, <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> illiterate peasants from which Verdi later liked to present himself as having emerged...

500|$|Hyacinthoides non-scripta {{was first}} {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in his seminal 1753 work , {{as a species}} in the genus Hyacinthus. The specific epithet [...] means [...] "unlettered" [...] or [...] "unmarked" [...] and was intended to distinguish this plant from the classical hyacinth of Greek mythology. This mythical flower, which was almost <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> modern hyacinth, sprang up from {{the blood of the}} dying prince Hyacinthus. His lover, the god Apollo, shed tears that marked the new flower's petals with the letters [...] "AIAI" [...] ("alas") as a sign of his grief.|$|E
500|$|Neval later {{explained}} [...] "My {{initial reaction}} to the part was surprise as Neighbours {{have never had a}} gay character. But the nature of the character never really bothered me. My only real concern was that the story would not be told in a sensationalist or distasteful way. She's not a stereotypical character and being gay is <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only interesting thing about her." [...] Neval made her first screen appearance as Lana during the episode broadcast on 30 August 2004. In April 2005, Eliza Taylor-Cotter said that she had originally auditioned for the role of Lana, before joining the cast as Janae Timmins.|$|E
500|$|The {{immediate}} {{reaction was}} mixed {{among members of}} Congress. Democratic supporters of the ruling were optimistic of future victories against funding restrictions, stating that, while they were glad the restriction fell, [...] " [...] opens the LSC up to even more attacks". Republicans in Congress condemned the decision, agreeing to work against it. Representative Steve Largent (R-OK) said, [...] "It'll be {{on the radar screen}} for sure ... Why are we giving taxpayer money to sue taxpayers?" [...] The New York Times described the decision {{as the end of the}} [...] "latest chapter, although almost <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> last, in a long political struggle over the federally financed program of civil legal services for the poor." ...|$|E
