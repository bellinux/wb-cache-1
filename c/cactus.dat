5|$|Cacti {{are often}} grown in greenhouses, {{particularly}} in regions unsuited to {{the cultivation of}} cacti outdoors, such the northern parts of Europe and North America. Here, they may be kept in pots or grown in the ground. Cacti are also grown as houseplants, many being tolerant of the often dry atmosphere. Cacti in pots may be placed outside in the summer to ornament gardens or patios, and then kept under cover during the winter. Less drought-resistant epiphytes, such as epiphyllum hybrids, Schlumbergera (the Thanksgiving or Christmas <b>cactus)</b> and Hatiora (the Easter <b>cactus),</b> are widely cultivated as houseplants.|$|E
5|$|Prickly pear cacti were {{introduced}} into Queensland, Australia as ornamental plants, starting in 1788.

5|$|While French {{innovations}} enriched {{the cuisine}} in many ways, not every innovation was favorable. Since the French {{introduction of the}} prickly pear <b>cactus</b> in the 18thcentury, the lifestyle of southern pastoralists became increasingly reliant on the plant to ensure food and water for their zebu as well as fruit and water for themselves {{during the dry season}} between July and December. However, in 1925, a French colonist wishing to eradicate the <b>cactus</b> on his property in the southwestern town of Toliara introduced the cochineal, an insect known to be a parasite of the plant. Within five years, nearly all the prickly pear <b>cactus</b> of southern Madagascar had been completely wiped out, sparking a massive famine from 1930–1931. Although these ethnic groups have since adapted in various ways, the famine period is commonly remembered as the time when their traditional lifestyle was ended by the arrival of foreigners on their land.|$|E

50|$|Among laypersons, Euphorbia {{species are}} among the most {{commonly}} confused plant taxa with <b>cacti,</b> especially the stem succulents.

Euphorbias from desert habitats with growth forms similar to <b>cacti</b> have thorns, which are different from the spines of <b>cacti.</b>|$|R
500|$|Botanically, [...] "spines" [...] are {{distinguished}} from [...] "thorns": spines are modified leaves, and thorns are modified branches. <b>Cacti</b> produce spines, always from areoles as noted above. Spines are present {{even in those}} <b>cacti</b> with leaves, such as Pereskia, Pereskiopsis and Maihuenia, so they clearly evolved before complete leaflessness. Some <b>cacti</b> only have spines when young, possibly only when seedlings. This is particularly true of tree-living <b>cacti,</b> such as Rhipsalis or Schlumbergera, but some ground-living <b>cacti,</b> such as Ariocarpus, also lack spines when mature.|$|R
50|$|Members of {{the spine}} plant family Cactaceae, native to the Americas, are known as <b>cacti</b> or <b>cactuses.</b> All <b>cacti</b> are succulents - plants which have adapted to arid climate or soil {{conditions}} and store water in their leaves, stems, and/or roots - but not all succulents are <b>cacti.</b> The conservatory’s collection includes <b>cacti</b> genera such as Opuntia, as well as succulents from other genera such as Pachypodium, Haworthia, Agave, Aloe, and Euphorbia.

5|$|As {{discussed}} above, any non-pseudoforest graph contains as a subgraph a handcuff, {{figure 8}}, or theta graph; any handcuff or figure 8 graph may be contracted {{to form a}} butterfly graph (five-vertex figure 8), and any theta graph may be contracted to form a diamond graph (four-vertex theta graph), so any non-pseudoforest contains either a butterfly or a diamond as a minor, {{and these are the}} only minor-minimal non-pseudoforest graphs. Thus, a graph is a pseudoforest if and only if it does not have the butterfly or the diamond as a minor. If one forbids only the diamond but not the butterfly, the resulting larger graph family consists of the <b>cactus</b> graphs and disjoint unions of multiple <b>cactus</b> graphs.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to enumerate various classes of {{cyclically}} colored m-gonal plane <b>cacti,</b> called m-ary <b>cacti.</b> This combinatorial problem is motivated by the topological classification of complex polynomials having at most m critical values, studied by Zvonkin and others.
