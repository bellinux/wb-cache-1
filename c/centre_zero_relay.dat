40|$|Abstract—The paper {{investigates the}} effect of link delays on the {{capacity}} of relay networks. The relay-with-delay {{is defined as a}} relay channel with relay encoding delay of d 2 units, or equivalently, a delay of d units on the link from the sender to the <b>relay,</b> <b>zero</b> delay on the links from the transmitter to the receiver and from the relay to the receiver, and <b>zero</b> <b>relay</b> encoding delay. Two special cases are studied. The first is the relay-with-unlimited lookahead, where each relay transmission can depend on its entire received sequence, and the second is the relay-without-delay, where the relay transmission can depend only on current and past received symbols, i. e., d = 0. Upper and lower bounds on capacity for these two channels that are tight in some cases are presented. It is shown that the cut-set bound for the classical relay channel, corresponding to the case where d = 1, does not hold for the relaywithout-delay. Further, it is shown that instantaneous relaying can be optimal and can achieve higher rates than the classical cut-set bound. Capacity for the classes of degraded and semi-deterministic relay-with-unlimited-look-ahead and relay-without-delay are established. These results are then extended to the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) relay-with-delay case, where it is shown that for any d 0, capacity is achieved using amplify-and-forward when the channel from the sender to the relay is sufficiently weaker than the other two channels. In addition, it is shown that a superposition of amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward can achieve higher rates than the classical cut-set bound.
