40|$|The Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS) 2009 / 10 is {{the latest}} in a series of {{household}} surveys that started in 1989. The survey collected information on Socio-economic characteristics at both household and community levels as well as information on the informal sector. The main objective of the survey was to collect high quality data on population and socio-economic characteristics of households for monitoring development performance. The UNHS 2009 / 10 comprised of six modules namely: the Socio-economic, Labour Force, Informal Sector, <b>Community,</b> <b>Price</b> and the Qualitative modules. This report is an abridged version that presents the major findings based on the socio-economic as well as the informal sector modules. It shows the levels of different indicators and their respective trends over time. Indicators on population characteristics, education, health, household expenditure and poverty among others have been presented at national, regional and rural-urban levels. A qualitative study was conducted alongside the UNHS 2009 / 10 quantitative survey to complement the findings as was the case in UNHS 2005 / 06. The main objective of th...|$|E

40|$|Food {{price policy}} {{relies heavily on}} {{estimated}} price elasticities of food demand to help balance the nutritional and economic objectives in poor countries. Economists use either unit values (ratios of household expenditure to quantity purchased) or <b>community</b> <b>prices</b> (enumerated from vendors in local markets) as proxies for market prices when estimating price elasticities with household survey data. Biases are believed to result from using unit values, due to measurement error and quality effects, but evidence on this issue is lacking and even less is known about <b>community</b> <b>prices.</b> This article provides an empirical evidence from Vietnam, which suggests that economists should exercise caution when estimating price elasticities from household surveys. A 14 -food demand system is estimated alternatively with unit values or <b>community</b> <b>prices,</b> and the elasticity of calories with respect to rice prices is calculated. This elasticity {{is more than twice}} as large (- 0. 54 versus - 0. 22) when <b>community</b> <b>prices</b> are used rather than unit values. Hence, conclusions about the nutritional effects of rice price increases appear sensitive to data choices made by economists. More generally, this discrepancy suggests that the household survey databases commonly used by economists may not provide reliable estimates. ...|$|R

Advantages of involving users who usually have strong analytic ability to detect violations and threats but not primarily responsible for security have been well emphasized in the literature. In this work we propose a reinforcement framework for enabling collaborative monitoring of policy violations by the users. We define a payoff model to formalize the reinforcement framework. The model stipulates appropriate payoffs as reward, punishment, and <b>community</b> <b>price</b> according to reporting of genuine or false violations, non-reporting of the detected violations, and proactive reporting of vulnerabilities and threats by the users. We define probabilistic robustness property of the resulting system and constraints for economic feasibility of the payoffs.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, the European Commission has {{negotiated}} a number of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) which contain both traditional elements of bilateral tariff reductions, as well as additional liberalisation measures like non-tariff barriers. According to economic theory, FTAs lower trade barriers on imported goods, leading to consumer welfare gains from increase in product variety, better quality products and lower prices for existing products. We estimate the variety, quality and price effects of EU FTAs, drawing on recent developments in the quality literature and using detailed import price and expenditure data. On average, trade agreements the EU has entered into over {{the past two}} decades increased the quality of UK imports from its FTA partners by 26 per cent and lowered the quality-adjusted price of imports by 19 per cent. We find that consumer prices fell by 0. 5 per cent for UK consumers as a result of FTAs with trade partners that are not members of the European <b>Community.</b> <b>Price</b> reductions for UK consumers are greater than those for EU 12 consumers, whose prices fell by 0. 3 per cent from non-EC FTAs. Using the set of non-EC FTA estimates to predict the effects of future FTAs, we find a projected decline in consumer prices for UK consumers of 0. 4 per cent from an FTA with the United States (TTIP) and 0. 2 per cent an FTA with Japan (EPA). For EU 12 consumers, the TTIP and EPA are predicted to reduce consumer prices by 0. 3 per cent and 0. 1 per cent...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of factor price {{stabilization}} on production decisions of the competitive firm with ex post production flexibility. Factor price stabilization is achieved through changes in the guaranteed minimum price and the imposed maximum price. For the risk-averse firm, the effect of factor price stabilization, through a mean-preserving contraction, on capital crucially depends on whether capital and the variable input are substitutes or complements {{as well as the}} observable characteristics of the variable input demand curve. Key words: factor p ¡ stabilization, risk aversion. It is well known that price uncertainty has an adverse impact on the supply of a risk-averse competitive firm which makes output decisions before observing the market price (Baron and Sandmo). Many agricultural price stabilization programs are designed to reduce price uncer-tainty. In the United States, the nonrecourse loan program provides downside price protection to grain producers, whereas the Farmer-Owned Reserve (FOR) program limits the upward movements of prices (Wright 1985). Similarly, the European <b>Community</b> <b>price</b> support mech-anism stabilizes the grain prices between inter-vention and target prices (Eeckhoudt and Han-sen). The literamre which smdies the impacts of price uncertainty on the supply side is abundant. For example, Turnovsky showed that price uncer-tainty may not {{have a negative impact on}} the planned output of a risk-averse firm with ex post production flexibility. In the same spirit, Hart-man (1976) introduced a two-factor model in which capital is a quasi-fixed input and deter-mined ex ante, but the variable input is chosen after the uncertainty is resolved. In a market equilibrium framework, price un-certainty of a primary commodity not only af-fects the supply side, as investigated by Baron and Sandmo, but also affects the d mand side S.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{evaluate}} price risk management strategies of farmers {{in terms of the}} food commodities market and the usage of different selling methods in the local Finnish farming <b>community.</b> <b>Price</b> risk management methods have been previously studied mostly concentrating on only few methods per study. However, this thesis will evaluate the usage of multiple methods in order to evaluate price risk management issues on a more comprehensive and broad scale. Furthermore, the thesis is studying Finnish farmers´ understanding of the global commodities market fluctuations and also how global volatility affects local commodities price and demand levels. The findings of the study were collected using a quantitative survey with a pool of respondents consisting of Finnish farmers. The data received from the survey responses was studied using statistical analysis program. From the data, the author studied the differentiating factors among respondents and interpreted the community understanding and mindset. The usage of different price risk management tools was also studied. The findings of this thesis show that Finnish farmers use mainly traditional and simple methods in lowering their price risk level in terms of the commodities market. Generally, farmers are having more risk adverse attitude in selling their grain, as they are mostly looking for a sufficient price level covering expenses and margin. The results demonstrated also how individuals were facing great difficulties in understanding the global commodities market and in how to operate correctly in the volatile market situation. The conclusion of the study is that in the agricultural industry, the most suitable price risk management strategy depends on individual farmers´ motivation to study the market activities on a regular bases and their level of understanding the commodities future stock markets...|$|E
40|$|The Andean Community's Price Band System (APBS), {{introduced}} in 1995, had the announced goal of reducing domestic price instability by buffering fluctuations in international prices {{through use of}} a variable import tariff. This paper evaluates {{the effects of the}} Andean Price Band System on domestic producer price variability, levels of nominal protection and changes in producer welfare. Application is made to four important food products - maize, rice, sugar and milk - in Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela, from the period 1990 to 1998. The effects of the APBS on producer price variability are analyzed through 1) comparing coefficients of variation of detrended, monthly deseasonalized real prices before and after the harmonization of the APBS in 1995, and 2) variance decomposition of real domestic prices. For Colombia and Ecuador, the APBS is shown to have successfully reduced real price instability below levels of instability which existed prior to its introduction. Real exchange rate instability also decreased sharply in these two countries following introduction of the APBS. In Venezuela, real price instability is shown to have increased following introduction of the APBS, while real exchange rate instability was unchanged. The APBS' effects on producer price protection are examined through estimation of average nominal protection coefficients for the twelve country-commodity combinations identified above before and after the introduction of the APBS. Results show that in all three countries and four virtually all products, the APBS contributed to increased producer protection. Finally, this paper uses a variant of the Newbery-Stiglitz approach to calculate efficiency benefits due to risk reduction among producers and the transfer benefits created by redistributing income among producers, consumers and government. The results show that the risk reduction benefits created by the APBS are small. Similarly, the income transfer effects, though larger, are also low, and both contribute to generally low levels of estimated producer welfare effects. Overall, the paper concludes that the APBS has been of limited usefulness as a policy instrument designed to reduce producer price variability in an economically efficient manner.

40|$|In the mid-to-late 1980 's, {{so called}} 'rust belt' {{cities in the}} UK began to respond to their {{industrial}} decline with local economic development strategies aimed at boosting employment. The strategies involved efforts to diversify traditional manufacturing heartlands into new service sector economies. One feature of the approach was the often rather implausible looking project of creating, out of unpromising material, a new urban sport and tourism industry (Roche 1992 b). Faced with economic and industrial decline in the 1980 's, Sheffield. traditionally a manufacturing and steel producing city, forged sport and tourism together as an alternative solution to regenerate its local economy. It was believed that investment in sporting infrastructure, and the staging of the XVI World Student Games would derive long-term economic and social benefits to all sections of the <b>community</b> (<b>Price</b> 1991). Criticised as reactive and quasi-strategic at the time, the longer-term assessment of these radical investment decisions has been overlooked. The value, role and function of major events in the local UK economic development process is therefore less than fully understood. Challenging the traditional economic base theory relationship between the manufacturing and service sectors of an economy, this thesis investigates whether investment in major events has been a rational approach to assist Sheffield's process of economic development. Utilising Williams' (1997) hypothesis that major events act as basic economic activities; by attracting and retaining external expenditure from sports tourists, {{the aim of the}} thesis is to identify whether events act as 'catalysts' to or 'motors' of local economic growth. Through the application of an expenditure based multiplier approach, five major events, staged in Sheffield between 1996 and 1998, are estimated to have had a collective impact of £ 10. 4 million over a period of twenty-one event days (£ 495, 00 per day). The findings of the research reveal that the staging of major sports events has a significant short-term impact on the local economy. The impact is conditional upon the type, status and duration of the event staged and the, nature of the visitor groups attracted. Extrapolating the results to all events staged in Sheffield since 1990, the thesis estimates that nearly E 32 million has been injected into the local economy. On the basis of the results, the research argues that major events {{are an important part of}} the consumer service sector of a local economy. As consumer services they act to stimulate economic growth by importing consumers. While major events are shown to function as basic sector economic activities and catalysts, they are not in themselves large enough to 'motor' a local economy, but are key instruments in diversifying the local economic base. In conclusion, the thesis recognises that the academic assessment of major events in the UK is relatively immature, and it highlights the need for rigorous evaluation of the broader cost-benefit parameters associated with staging major events. Sporting, cultural, political, social and environmental impacts of major events are a few of the themes lughlighted as areas of future research. </p...|$|E

In contrast, a personalized pricing mechanism is able to treat different users in different ways, according to their flexibility, and thus achieve a specific behavioral change efficiently.|$|R

40|$|In {{the view}} of many analysts, the best way to assist “underwater ” homeowners—those who owe more on their {{mortgages}} than their houses are worth—is to reduce the principal on their home loans. Yet in the case of privately securitized mortgages, such write-downs are almost impossible to carry out, since loan modifications on the scale necessitated by the housing market crash would require collective action by a multitude of geographically dispersed security holders. The solution, this study suggests, is for state and municipal governments to use their eminent domain powers to buy up and restructure underwater mortgages, thereby sidestepping the need to coordinate action across large numbers of security holders.
