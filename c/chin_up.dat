25|$|The correct {{position}} for this discipline, {{as in all}} forms of riding, is a balanced seat. This is seen when a bystander can run an imaginary straight line that passes through the rider's ear, shoulder, hip, and heel. This means the rider's feet and legs must hang directly in balance so that the heel hits this line, with heels down. The rider should also be sitting as straight as possible, but with their hips under their body, sitting firmly on their seat bones, not sitting on one's crotch with an arched back. The rider should have their weight sunk into their seat and distributed through their legs. The rider's shoulders should be rolled back and their <b>chin</b> <b>up</b> {{to show that they}} are looking forward.|$|E
2500|$|On November 13, 2006, Knight {{was shown}} {{allegedly}} hitting player Michael Prince under the chin {{to get him}} to make eye contact. Although Knight didn't comment on the incident afterwards and has not yet done so, Prince, his parents, and Texas Tech Athletic Director Gerald Myers insisted that Knight did nothing wrong and that he merely lifted Prince's chin and told him, [...] "Hold your head up and don't worry about mistakes. Just play the game." [...] Prince commented, [...] "He was trying to teach me and I had my head down so he raised my <b>chin</b> <b>up.</b> He was telling me {{to go out there and}} don't be afraid to make mistakes. He said I was being too hard on myself." ...|$|E
50|$|Budd's total {{winnings}} {{from the}} Canadian and World Superstars contests were about $170,000. His best events were the 800 meter/half mile run and <b>chin</b> <b>ups.</b>|$|R
50|$|A retired accountant, Jaskulski {{worked as}} a {{controller}} at KHON-TV. He trained by doing <b>chin</b> <b>ups</b> and running down the hallways of his apartment building. With failing eyesight, {{he was forced to}} stop the workouts shortly before his death.|$|R
50|$|They must {{complete}} {{a minimum of}} 10 <b>chin</b> <b>ups,</b> 35 push ups and 100 sit ups, then run 10 km in under 46 minutes and finally swim 400 metres in under 10 minutes. All this is done consecutively without a rest. This is the minimum fitness standard required, and is assessed with zero tolerance.|$|R
2500|$|Switchfoot {{was founded}} in 1996 as <b>Chin</b> <b>Up,</b> {{consisting}} of Jon Foreman and his brother Tim, along with Chad Butler on drums. After playing only a few shows, the band was contacted by music industry veteran Charlie Peacock and eventually signed to his indie label [...] under the current moniker, Switchfoot. Re:think went on to distribute the first three Switchfoot albums, The Legend of Chin, New Way to Be Human, and Learning to Breathe. Because Re:think was bought out by Christian giant Sparrow Records before Switchfoot's first release, however, the band's and Peacock's intentions of being marketed outside of the Contemporary Christian music scene and reaching a wider audience were put on hold. Consequently, the band was mostly marketed to Christian radio and retail outlets early in their careers, a time Jon Foreman has described as when [...] "half of who we were was lost." ...|$|E

5000|$|Eckenstein {{was one of}} the {{few people}} who readily climbed with mystic and magician Aleister Crowley. In his {{autobiography}} Confessions, Crowley praises Eckenstein in several passages, mentioning his gymnastic strength, including his ability to do one-arm <b>chin</b> <b>ups.</b> Crowley dedicated the book to six men, including [...] "OSCAR ECKENSTEIN - who trained me to follow the trail".|$|R
50|$|When <b>Chin</b> Fu shows <b>up</b> at {{a nightclub}} one night, no one realizes {{he is the}} son of a kung-fu master out for revenge for his father's murder. <b>Chin</b> teams <b>up</b> with a sexy lounge singer and heads out to {{infiltrate}} the Japanese mafia.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1980s {{the band}} {{struggled}} both financially {{and in its}} performance. Romano decided to try a new approach, and after many years the band began to see success in their marching competitions. He is known for starting the band's tradition of reciting their motto, [...] "feet together, shoulders back, <b>chins</b> <b>up,</b> and eyes with pride" [...] before taking the field.|$|R
60|$|She {{applied a}} large brush to Hester's forehead, and drew it thence down her left cheek, under her <b>chin,</b> <b>up</b> the right cheek, {{and back to}} the {{starting}} point, thus producing a black band or circle two inches broad.|$|E
6000|$|... "That yellow hair--let it hang, woman! do {{not touch}} it I say.... Slip that {{goatskin}} off thy loins, man ... By Jupiter 'tis the best of thee thou hidest.... Hold thy <b>chin</b> <b>up</b> girl, we'll have no doleful faces to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|NORA [tossing her <b>chin</b> <b>up</b> at once]. Oh, I'm {{not expecting}} him particularly. It's a wonder he's {{come back at}} all. After staying away {{eighteen}} years he can harly expect us to be very anxious to see him, can he now? ...|$|E
5000|$|The game is {{composed}} of seven training events whom the player must complete. Upon a near-success failure to complete an event (failing too severely results in game over), the player must do a set number of <b>chin</b> <b>ups</b> as punishment (this chance is given only once) {{in order to continue}} into the succeeding events, or it's game over. The events are as followed: ...|$|R
60|$|Peterkin laid {{hold of his}} <b>chin,</b> pursed <b>up</b> his mouth, {{and looked}} at me with a gleeful leer.|$|R

60|$|After a low, scornful “Of course” {{he seemed}} now {{to hold on}} the wall with his fixed stare the vision of that city office, “at the back of Cannon Street Station,” while he growled and mouthed a fragmentary description, jerking his <b>chin</b> <b>up</b> now and then, as if angry.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, what is it?" [...] said Frank, looking rather disgusted. [...] "What {{makes you}} stick your <b>chin</b> <b>up</b> {{and look in}} that way?" [...] Frank had {{hitherto}} been rather a despot among his sisters, and forgot that the eldest of them was now passing altogether from under his sway {{to that of the}} tailor's son.|$|E
6000|$|They {{walked in}} silence. Constable Plimmer {{was a man}} with a rigid sense of what was and what was not fitting {{behaviour}} in a policeman on duty: he aimed always at a machine-like impersonality. There were times when it came hard, but he did his best. He strode on, his <b>chin</b> <b>up</b> and his eyes averted. And beside him-- ...|$|E
5000|$|In a Georgia State Capitol {{ceremony}} on Martin Luther King Day in 2012, Georgia Governor Nathan Deal quoted <b>Chins</b> <b>Up!</b> by Mildred Seydell: [...] "Great men don't hate. They are {{too busy}} with their accomplishments. Hate flourishes in the breasts {{of those who have}} time to feel their wrongs. Hate is the weapon of the defeated, love that of the victor. No man ever won by hating, but many have conquered by loving." ...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{this order}} is {{commonly}} seen, it can vary widely, with some facial hair {{starting from the}} <b>chin</b> and <b>up</b> towards the sideburns.|$|R
60|$|The {{blood of}} indignation and anger had been rising to Thuvia's face. Her <b>chin</b> was <b>up,</b> a haughty curve upon her perfect lips.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he marched}} {{off to the}} Herr Mayor's house with his <b>chin</b> <b>up,</b> for he might hold his head as high as any, {{now that he had}} such a purse as that in his pocket. As for the Herr Mayor, he thought that it was a nice, pretty little purse; but could it do this and that as he had said? ...|$|E
60|$|He gaily complied, and she tied her dimpled <b>chin</b> <b>up,</b> {{and shook}} her head into her bonnet, and pulled out the bows of her bonnet-strings, and got her gloves on, finger by finger, and finally got them on her little plump hands, and bade him good-bye and went down. Mr Lightwood's impatience was much {{relieved}} when he found her dressed for departure.|$|E
60|$|This sub-Amanda was {{perceptible}} {{next morning}} again, flitting {{about in the}} background of a glad and loving adventuress, a pre-occupied Amanda who had put her head down while the real Amanda flung her <b>chin</b> <b>up</b> and contemplated things on the Asiatic scale, and who was apparently engaged in disentangling something obscure connected with Mr. Rathbone-Sanders that ought never to have been entangled....|$|E
6000|$|... 'I saw it this time,' {{returned}} Sophy. 'His <b>chin</b> went <b>up</b> {{in the air}} at once. He set me {{down for}} Mrs. Kendal, and you for Miss Sophy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Sir, I {{never saw}} {{you in my}} life," [...] {{retorted}} Hardman, his bearded <b>chin</b> working <b>up</b> and down with the vehemence of his speech. And he turned away.|$|R
50|$|In July 2013, he {{appeared}} on Channel 4's Ramadan Reflections. In February 2014, <b>Chin</b> set <b>up</b> a charity ABC Life. In June 2014, he visited Pakistan to deliver a lecture and record television interviews at Dreamworld Family Resort in Karachi.|$|R
6000|$|She {{turned away}} {{to survey the}} little house again; it was visible in bright strips between the red-scarred pine stems. She looked at it <b>chin</b> <b>up,</b> with a still approval--but she was the slenderest loveliness, and with such a dignity!--and she spoke at length as though the board had never existed. [...] "It's like {{a little piece of}} another world; so bright and so--perfect." ...|$|E
60|$|A fit of {{coughing}} {{checked his}} sentence in a faint splutter. Directly afterwards he swallowed--as it were--a couple of pebbles, throwing his <b>chin</b> <b>up</b> in the act; and Lingard, {{who looked at}} him narrowly, saw a bone, sharp and triangular like {{the head of a}} snake, dart up and down twice under the skin of his throat. Then that, too, did not move. Nothing moved.|$|E
60|$|She {{glared at}} him defiantly. He glared back at her. Then his sense of humour came to his rescue. She looked so absurdly small {{standing}} there with her <b>chin</b> <b>up</b> and her fists clenched. He laughed delightedly. He went {{up to her and}} placed a hand on each of her shoulders, looking down at her. He felt that he loved her for her championship of Bill.|$|E
5000|$|The {{film has}} two endings. The normal one that {{appeared}} in theaters and the special ending for Malaysia where O and <b>Chin</b> end <b>up</b> being caught by police. This was supposedly done as per special request to show that [...] "Crime doesn't pay".|$|R
6000|$|While Trot was observing this dreadful machine, {{the door}} opened and in walked the Six Snubnosed Princesses, all in a row and with their <b>chins</b> <b>up</b> as if they disdained {{everyone}} but themselves. They were magnificently dressed, and their blue hair was carefully arranged in huge towers upon their heads, with blue plumes stuck into the tops. These plumes waved gracefully in the air with every mincing step the Princesses took. Rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons, and the royal ladies were fully as gorgeous as they were haughty and overbearing. They marched to their chairs and seated themselves to enjoy the cruel scene their father was about to enact, and Cap'n Bill bowed to them politely and said: ...|$|R
60|$|The Major {{advancing}} his double <b>chin,</b> and pursing <b>up</b> {{his blue}} lips into a soothing expression, affected the profoundest sympathy.|$|R
