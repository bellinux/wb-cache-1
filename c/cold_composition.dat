40|$|With {{data from}} Van Allen Probes, we {{investigate}} electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) wave excitation using simultaneously observed ion distributions. Strong He band waves occurred while the spacecraft was moving through an enhanced density region. We extract from helium, oxygen, proton, and electron mass spectrometer measurement the velocity distributions of warm heavy ions {{as well as}} anisotropic energetic protons that drive wave growth through the ion cyclotron instability. Fitting the measured ion fluxes to multiple sinm-type distribution functions, {{we find that the}} observed ions make up about 15 % of the total ions, but about 85 % of them are still missing. By making legitimate estimates of the unseen cold (below ∼ 2 eV) ion composition from cutoff frequencies suggested by the observed wave spectrum, a series of linear instability analyses and hybrid simulations are carried out. The simulated waves generally vary as predicted by linear theory. They are more sensitive to the cold O+ concentration than the cold He+ concentration. Increasing the cold O+ concentration weakens the He band waves but enhances the O band waves. Finally, the exact <b>cold</b> ion <b>composition</b> is suggested to be in a range when the simulated wave spectrum best matches the observed one...|$|R

In this paper, glass-forming regions were examined for the system SVG-MgO-ZrO_ 2, furthermore the alkaline durability and crystallization property were investigated on the glasses for GRC (Glassfiber Reinforced Concrete). The batches of the system were heated at 1400 °C and 1500 °C, and quenched into <b>cold</b> water.

40|$|We {{simulate}} electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) wave {{growth and}} evolution within three regions, the plasmasphere (or plasmaspheric plume), the plasmapause, and the low-density plasmatrough outside the plasmapause. First, {{we use a}} ring current simulation with a plasmasphere model to model the particle populations {{that give rise to}} the instability for conditions observed on 9 June 2001. Then, using two different models for the <b>cold</b> ion <b>composition,</b> we do a full-scale hybrid code simulation in dipole coordinates of the EMIC waves on a meridional plane at magnetic local time = 18 and at 1900 UT within a range of L shell from L= 4. 9 to 6. 7. EMIC waves were observed during 9 June 2001 by Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) spacecraft. While an exact comparison between observed and simulated spectra is not possible here, we do find significant similarities between the two, at least at one location within the region of largest wave growth. We find that the plasmapause is not a preferred region for EMIC wave growth, though waves can grow in that region. The density gradient within the plasmapause does, however, affect the orientation of wavefronts and wave vector both within the plasmapause and in adjacent regions. There is a preference for EMIC waves to be driven in the He+ band (frequencies between the O+ and He+ gyrofrequencies) within the plasmasphere, although they can also grow in the plasmatrough. If present, H+ band waves are more likely to grow in the plasmatrough. This fact, plus L dependence of the frequency and possible time evolution toward lower frequency waves, can be explained by a simple model. Large O+ concentration limits the frequency range of or even totally quenches EMIC waves. This is more likely to occur in the plasmatrough at solar maximum. Such large O+ concentration significantly affects the H+ cutoff frequency and hence the width in frequency of the stop band above the He+ gyrofrequency. EMIC wave surfaces predicted by cold plasma theory are altered by the finite temperature of the ring current H+...|$|R

One {{might expect that}} shearing forces induced by a nonuniform fluid flow would also destabilize proteins, as when a protein solution flows rapidly through a narrow channel. However, although the protein literature contains many references to shear denaturation, we find little quantitative evidence for the phenomenon. We have investigated whether a high shear can destabilize a small globular protein to any measurable extent. We study a protein (horse cytochrome c, 104 amino acids) whose fluorescence increases sharply upon unfolding. By forcing the sample through a silica capillary (inner diameter 150 – 180 μm) at speeds approaching 10 m/s, we subject the protein to shear rates dvz/dr as large as ∼ 2 × 105 s− 1 while illuminating it with an ultraviolet laser. We can readily detect fluorescence changes of < 1 %, corresponding to shifts of <∼ 0. 01 kJ/mol in {{the stability of the}} folded state. We find no evidence that even our highest shear rates significantly destabilize the folded protein.

The data was obtained from 20 subjects (age: 19 – 36 years; BMI: 17 – 32 kg/m 2). BC, MR, rectal and skin temperatures were measured for 1 h at 22 °C, followed by 3 h at 15 °C. A mean bias of 1. 8 °C, with a standard error of 0. 7 °C, resulted for the mean skin temperature of an average person at 15 °C. When subjective BC and measured MR were incorporated the bias was - 0. 2 ± 0. 9 °C. For the hand-back skin temperature the bias ± standard error fell from 5. 3 ± 2. 8 °C for an average person to 2. 0 ± 2. 5 °C, when using individualized characteristics. Trunk skin temperatures were not significantly affected by the adjustments. In conclusion, this study shows that on a group level predictions of skin temperatures can be improved when adopting individualized body characteristics and measured MR, but the predictions on an individual level were not improved...|$|R

Thanks to the extensive exploration of the 1960 s and 1970 s and the compositional mapping of the 1990 s missions (Galileo, Clementine and Luna Prospector), the Moon has a unique geological dataset among the extraterrestrial Solar System bodies. The recent and on-going missions, along with the future plans for lunar exploration, will together acquire {{an extraordinary amount of}} data. This should provide a solid basis to meet broad objectives like the constraints on the heterogeneity of Lunar composition and the presence of water deposits, the understanding of volcanic and tectonic evolution as well as more specific issues such as the genetic classification of volcanic domes, origin of the dark halos craters, lava flow emplacement mechanisms, and the kinematics and deformational styles of tectonic structures.

The amount of total proteins in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -enriched fractions isolated from these cells increased in parallel with the process of <b>cold</b> acclimation. Protein <b>compositions</b> in the ER-enriched fraction also changed seasonally, with a prominent accumulation of 20 -kD (WAP 20) and 27 -kD (WAP 27) proteins in winter. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of WAP 20 exhibited homology to ER-localized small heat-shock proteins (smHSPs), whereas that of WAP 27 did not exhibit homology to any known proteins. Like other smHSPs, WAP 20 formed a complex of high molecular mass in native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, not only WAP 20 but also 21 -kD proteins reacted with antibodies against WAP 20. Fractionation of the crude microsomes by isopycnic sucrose-gradient centrifugation revealed that both WAP 27 and WAP 20 were distributed on a density corresponding to the fractions with higher activity of ER marker enzyme, suggesting localization of these proteins in the ER. When ER-enriched fractions were treated with trypsin in the absence of detergent, WAP 20 and WAP 27 were undigested, suggesting localization of these proteins inside the ER vesicle. The accumulation of a large quantity of smHSPs in the ER in winter {{as a result of}} seasonal cold acclimation indicates that these proteins may {{play a significant role in}} the acquisition of freezing tolerance in cortical parenchyma cells of mulberry trees...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, several fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) have been {{synthesized}} from various fatty acid feedstocks: used frying olive oil, pork fat, soybean, rapeseed, sunflower and coconut.

Other biodiesel properties such as <b>composition,</b> <b>cold</b> filter plugging point (CFPP), flash point (FP) and kinematic viscosity have also been analyzed using standard methods in order to further characterize the biodiesel produced. In addition, the effect on the biodiesel properties of using 4 -allyl- 2, 6 -dimetoxiphenol and cathecol as additives in biodiesel blends with rapeseed and with soybean has also been analyzed. The use of both antioxidants results in a considerable improvement in the oxidation stability of both types of biodiesel, especially using cathecol. Adding cathecol loads as low as 0. 05 % (m/m) in blends with soybean biodiesel and as low as 0. 10 % (m/m) in blends with rapeseed biodiesel is sufficient for the oxidation stabilities to comply with the restrictions established by the European EN 14214 standard. An empirical linear equation is proposed to correlate the oxidation stability by the two methods, PetroOXY and Rancimat. It has been found that the presence of either cathecol or 4 -allyl- 2, 6 -dimetoxiphenol as additives affects the correlation observed...|$|R
40|$|Application {{prospects}} in the automotive industry have led to increasing studies on Al-Mg- Cu-Si alloys. In this thesis, nine Al-(1 - 3) Mg-(0 - 0. 4) Cu- 0. 15 Si- 0. 25 Mn (in wt%) alloys with potential applications in packaging and automotive industries have been investigated. By means of mechanical testing, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), several mechanisms was identified that influence the final strength of cold rolled alloys during ageing: solid solution, work hardening, recovery and precipitation. Microstructure analyses revealed the formation of undissolved particles consuming the small Si addition, which influences age hardening behaviour of the alloys. Tensile testing was performed to evaluate the strength and work hardening. The integrated experimental results showed that for cold worked samples, b² (Mg 2 Si) contributes to age hardening of Cu-free alloys, whilst both b² and S (Al 2 CuMg) contribute to that of Cu-containing alloys. According to the experimental findings, a yield strength model has been developed to elucidate the relation between processing and the final strength. It consists of three main components: i) dissolution of intermetallic phase Mg 2 Si; ii) precipitation of two strengthening phases b² and S; iii) strengthening contributions from solution strengthening, dislocation strengthening and precipitation hardening due to the strengthening phases. The model was calibrated and tested using separate tensile data and was applied to predict the yield strength evolution of cold worked samples during ageing. An accuracy of 8. 6 MPa (about 4 % of the total range of strengths) has been achieved. Based on {{the analysis of the}} relation of work hardening with <b>cold</b> work, <b>composition</b> and ageing time, three primary findings were obtained: i) cold worked samples usually have the lowest work hardening rate (WHR); ii) WHR increases after 30 -minute ageing due to recovery and iii) WHR increases with decreasing level of cold work and increasing Mg and Cu contents. Work hardening models based on the Kocks-Mecking (KM) model and the Kocks-Mecking-Estrin (KME) model have been utilized to explain the main trends. The modelling results showed that the KM model is able to predict the work hardening behaviour of cold worked samples reasonably well. However, the KME model is insufficient to fully describe that of cold-worked-and-aged samples. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Posttranslational {{modifications}} and proteolytic processing regulate {{almost all}} physiological processes. Dysregulation can potentially result in pathologic protein species causing diseases. Thus, tissue species proteomes of diseased individuals provide diagnostic information. Since {{the composition of}} tissue proteomes can rapidly change during tissue homogenization {{by the action of}} enzymes released from their compartments, disease specific protein species patterns can vanish. Recently, we described a novel, ultrafast and soft method for cold vaporization of tissue via desorption by impulsive vibrational excitation (DIVE) using a picosecond-infrared-laser (PIRL). Given that DIVE extraction may provide improved access to the original composition of protein species in tissues, we compared the proteome composition of tissue protein homogenates after DIVE homogenization with conventional homogenizations. A higher number of intact protein species was observed in DIVE homogenates. Due to the ultrafast transfer of proteins from tissues via gas phase into frozen condensates of the aerosols, intact protein species were exposed to a lesser extent to enzymatic degradation reactions compared with conventional protein extraction. In addition, total yield of the number of proteins is higher in DIVE homogenates, because they are very homogenous and contain almost no insoluble particles, allowing direct analysis with subsequent analytical methods without the necessity of centrifugation.

We studied the space use of 17 female and 9 male radio-tracked porcupines in an evergreen coastal woodland (“macchia”, EW) and in an agricultural estate (AE), with special reference {{to the use of}} cultivations. Home range sizes of male porcupines (4. 72 – 323. 40) ranged around 114 ha (median) during the warm period (April–September) and 162 ha during the cold one (October–March). Home ranges of females (2. 48 – 323. 40) were c. 91 ha during the warm period and c. 143 ha during the <b>cold</b> one. Habitat <b>composition</b> and selection changed from the cold to the warm months, with porcupines being present in agricultural areas especially in the latter. Home range overlap between members of the same pair varied from 57 % to 97 % (median, 75 %). Habitat selection was analyzed at the second (within study area) and at the third (within home range) order of selection. Within study areas, porcupines avoided cultivations and selected habitats with dense vegetation, providing cover and food. Within home ranges, in the warm period, porcupines selected agricultural areas in EW, where this habitat represented a minor portion of the study site. In that season, the Mediterranean “macchia” is a poor source of food, forcing porcupines to travel long distances to reach feeding sites. No significant difference of habitat selection within home ranges was detected between members of the same pair. Cultivations may play a key-role for porcupine survival, especially in poor habitats, as they provide abundant food resources in the warm period...|$|R
40|$|For most {{fish species}} raised in marine aquaculture, {{the use of}} live feeds cannot be {{replaced}} by formulated diets. Artemia nauplii and rotifers are still {{the most commonly used}} live feeds. A good alternative lies in the use of copepods which could lead to the cultivation of new fish species. Cold stored subitaneous eggs from the continuously cultured calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa were used to investigate the effect of storage upon the viability of the eggs, the development of the copepod community originating from the cold stored eggs. Finally a 3 days snapshot of the egg production of the first generation of females was followed. This was done in order to develop a database usable within copepod dependent hatcheries. The viability of cold stored A. tonsa eggs remained high (> 70 % hatching rate) for 11 months of storage. Generally, the period of storage was observed to decrease the viability (hatching rate) of the eggs and no hatching was observed after twenty months of cold storage. Hatched populations of copepods experienced increased mortality rate with longer storage of the eggs from which they originated. This mortality ranged from 0. 035 to 0. 13 d− 1 for non-stored (fresh) and 12 months stored eggs, respectively. However, all copepod communities originating from fresh to 12 months stored eggs reached adulthood. Additionally, the egg production from the stored generation was apparently normal and the viability of their eggs was not statistically different when compared to productions from non-stored communities. Contents of total fatty acids decreased during the storage period. Contents of free amino acids were not statistically different for eggs cold stored up to 12 months, but had decreased severely by 20 months. In conclusion, we consider it safe to store the eggs for up to one year at 2 – 3 °C during which the eggs retain their viability and biochemical <b>composition.</b> <b>Cold</b> storage of calanoid copepod eggs is relevant for aquaculture as inoculum for culturing live food...|$|R
40|$|Cadmium (Cd) is a {{naturally}} occurring element in soils. It is a non-essential trace element {{that can have}} toxic effects on fauna at relatively low concentrations. Several studies have reported above background levels of the metal in New Zealand (NZ) agricultural soils. This {{is thought to be}} due to the repeated applications of phosphate fertiliser where Cd is a commonly found impurity. Cd is taken up by plants relatively easily and can accumulate there to potentially dangerous concentrations without any effects on the plant itself. This has resulted in the NZ government imposing a 1. 8 mg/kg limit on Cd in soil after which P fertiliser applications have to cease. The addition of organic amendments into the soil has been shown to reduce the plant uptake of Cd. This study has been carried out to gain better understanding of which specific organic amendment has the greatest potential for reducing plant uptake of Cd. The amendments used in the experiments were two types of peat, bio-solids from Kaikoura and Christchurch, coffee grounds, and municipal compost from Parkhouse Garden Supplies, Living Earth and Oderings. The study involved analyses of pH, conductivity, total organic carbon, water-soluble carbon (hot and <b>cold</b> water), elemental <b>composition,</b> cation exchange capacity (CEC) and the sorption potential for Cd of each amendment. Results indicated that the two bio-solid samples had Cd concentrations that were too high for potential application to the soil as this would risk accumulation at rates of up to 10 times higher than the other amendments. The findings from the Cd sorption experiment indicate that Parkhouse (PH) compost had the greatest capacity to adsorb Cd, the Kd value was 11317. This result was significantly larger than all other amendments, with Living Earth (LE) showing the second highest value of 578. This suggests the potential ability of Living Earth compost to be used as an amendment for soils contaminated with Cd. The significant sorption of Cd by PH compost could be attributed to the sulphur concentration of PH, as this was twice as high as any amendment (excluding bio solids). Parkhouse White (PHW) had the lowest S concentration but a similar CEC to PH, however the corresponding Kd was significantly lower (27). This suggests the potential addition of gypsum (CaSO 4) to municipal composts can cause the associated S groups to form complexes with Cd, immobilising it and reducing plant uptake. Although, the sulphides or thiol groups are more likely to form complexes with Cd, rather than the sulphate groups. Overall, this study has indicated that the organic amendment with the greatest capacity to adsorb Cd is PH compost, with LE showing a reasonable capacity also. The next step would involve incorporating these composts into contaminated soils and to analyse the effect this has the plant uptake of Cd...|$|R
