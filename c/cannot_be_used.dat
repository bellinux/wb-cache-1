5|$|A pKa value {{obtained}} in a mixed solvent <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> directly for aqueous solutions. The {{reason for this}} is that when the solvent is in its standard state its activity is defined as one. For example, the standard state of water:dioxane 9:1 is precisely that solvent mixture, with no added solutes. To obtain the pKa value for use with aqueous solutions it has to be extrapolated to zero co-solvent concentration from values obtained from various co-solvent mixtures.|$|E
5|$|Aqueous {{solutions}} {{with normal}} water <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for 1H NMR measurements but heavy water, D2O, {{must be used}} instead. 13C NMR data, however, {{can be used with}} normal water and 1H NMR spectra can be used with non-aqueous media. The quantities measured with NMR are time-averaged chemical shifts, as proton exchange is fast on the NMR time-scale. Other chemical shifts, such as those of 31P can be measured.|$|E

5|$|Abolition of Titles: Article 18 of the {{constitution}} prohibits the State from conferring any titles. Citizens of India cannot accept titles from a foreign State.

However, Military and academic distinctions can be conferred on the citizens of India. The awards of Bharat Ratna and Padma Vibhushan <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> by the recipient as a title and do not, accordingly, come within {{the constitution}}al prohibition".

Such lipids have also been detected in even older rocks from west Greenland. The oldest such traces come from the Isua district, which include Earth's oldest known sediments, formed 3.8billion years ago.
