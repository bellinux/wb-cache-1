She kept this until 1967, when the home was no longer needed. This was near her own home in Peacehaven, and Fields often visited, with the children all calling her 'Aunty Grace'.|$|E
25|$|As far as Lange is concerned, he was {{the biggest}} murderer I have ever known. To {{write a book about}} him would {{definitely}} not be enough. As he is dead, it is no use talking about him. I would, however, mention {{that he was one of}} the most notorious anti-Semites in the 20th century. He hated Jews so much that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> at them; one never wanted to pass him either in the motor pool or anywhere else.|$|E
25|$|Harlow's first {{experiments}} involved isolating {{a monkey}} {{in a cage}} surrounded by steel walls with a small one-way mirror, so the experimenters could look in, but the monkey <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> out. The only connection the monkey had with the world was when the experimenters' hands changed his bedding or delivered fresh water and food. Baby monkeys were placed in these boxes soon after birth; four were left for 30 days, four for six months, and four for a year.|$|E

25|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the All-Palestine Government in 1959, under the excuse of pan-Arabism, Egypt continued to occupy the Gaza Strip until 1967. Egypt never annexed the Gaza Strip, but instead treated it as a controlled territory and administered it through a military governor. The influx of over 200,000 refugees from former Mandatory Palestine, roughly a quarter of those who fled or were expelled from their homes during, and in the aftermath of, the 1948 Arab–Israeli War into Gaza resulted in a dramatic decrease in the standard of living. Because the Egyptian government restricted movement to and from the Gaza Strip, its inhabitants <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> elsewhere for gainful employment.|$|E
25|$|The {{technology}} {{was first used}} by Channel 4 during a Test match between England and Pakistan on Lord's Cricket Ground, on 21 May 2001. It is used primarily {{by the majority of}} television networks to track the trajectory of balls in flight. In the winter season of 2008/2009 the ICC trialled a referral system where Hawk-Eye was used for referring decisions to the third umpire if a team disagreed with an LBW decision. The third umpire was able to look at what the ball actually did up to the point when it hit the batsman, but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> at the predicted flight of the ball after it hit the batsman.|$|E
25|$|Claude McKay was a {{poet who}} flourished during the Harlem Renaissance, a major {{literary}} {{movement in the}} 1920s. During this time, McKay’s poems challenged white authority while celebrating Jamaican culture. He also wrote tales about the trials and tribulations {{of life as a}} black man in both Jamaica and America. McKay was not secretive about his hatred for racism and felt that racist people were stupid and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> past their shortsightedness and hatred. In tales like Home to Harlem', McKay depicts a culture in Harlem that is full of drug use, prostitution, and a variety of sexual encounters. His depiction was criticized as a negative portrayal of Harlem and its lower-class citizens by prominent figures such as W.E.B. DuBois, but was later applauded as a literary force in the Harlem Renaissance. McKay’s poetry brought awareness to the racist treatment that many black individuals faced.|$|E

They <b>could</b> <b>not</b> but <b>look</b> on their Roman congregations, and on themselves, as what in fact and law they were, the rightful {{owners of the}} soil. They were but defending or recovering their original rights. Would not the end justify the means? ...|$|R

500|$|Jolie was {{involved}} in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She {{had fallen in love with}} Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair, saying, [...] "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife." [...] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.|$|E
500|$|Things soon degraded, a legal {{hearing was}} held, and Sullivan {{supported}} Carte by making an affidavit erroneously stating {{that there were}} minor legal expenses outstanding from a battle Gilbert had with Lillian Russell. On 5 May 1890, Gilbert had written to Sullivan: [...] "The time for {{putting an end to}} our collaboration has at last arrived." [...] Gilbert later asked Sullivan to say he had been mistaken in his affidavit, but Sullivan refused. Gilbert felt it was a moral issue, and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> past it. Sullivan felt that Gilbert was questioning his good faith, and in any event, Sullivan had other reasons to stay in Carte's good graces: Carte was building a new theatre, the Royal English Opera House, to produce Sullivan's only grand opera, Ivanhoe. Gilbert brought suit, and after The Gondoliers closed in 1891, he withdrew the performance rights to his libretti, vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy.|$|E
500|$|Curtis {{stated that}} casting an actor to play Van Gogh was done carefully, {{as he wanted}} him to feel to the {{audience}} as Van Gogh, not [...] "like a bloke they’ve seen acting lots of other parts, in an orange wig". Tony Curran was ultimately cast as the part; Curtis called him a [...] "wonderful actor" [...] who [...] "really <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> more like" [...] Van Gogh. Curran, Smith and Gillan {{got to know each}} other very well, which Gillan hoped would be evident in their chemistry in the episode. Bill Nighy appears uncredited as the Musée d'Orsay's expert on Van Gogh. Nighy was rumoured to have been considered for the role of the Ninth Doctor when the show was revived. Campbell stated that they were [...] "very fortunate" [...] to have Nighy in the role, who he believed was someone people paid attention to, and the audience needed to pay attention to his character as he said facts which would become important later in the story.|$|E

500|$|Ann Frewen died in May 1880. The inquest {{into her}} death {{was held at}} the nearby Bull and Butcher public house, presided over by the county coroner, Frederick Charsley. Part of the inquest's remit was to {{consider}} the matter of Ellen's subsequent care. Thomas Frewen was reported as being [...] "quite evasive" [...] when the coroner asked him how Ellen was fed, and although Hayman testified to reaffirm his stance that Ellen's illness was genuine, Reverend Studholme was less certain. However, he could not offer any evidence to this effect, even though he had made several unannounced visits to Ellen's home. Charsley concluded that Thomas <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> after Ellen, as his job left him absent from their home all day, and that {{the other members of the}} household would be too busy with its upkeep. Therefore, he turned Ellen's care over to her married sisters, Elizabeth Stacey and Grace Blackall, both of whom lived in Turville. The cause of Ann's death was found to be oedema of the heart, from which she had been suffering for many years.|$|E
500|$|New York {{got off to}} a {{slow start}} in the 1957 season, and by early June was six games out. By then, the team was making {{headlines}} off the field. Some of the Yankees were known for partying late into the night, something Stengel turned a blind eye to as long as the team performed well. The May 16 brawl at the Copacabana nightclub in New York involved Martin, Berra, Mantle, Ford, Hank Bauer and other Yankees, resulted in the arrest of Bauer (the charge of assault was later dropped) and exhausted Yankee management's patience with Martin. Stengel was close to Martin, who took great pride in being a Yankee, and Topping and Weiss did not involve the manager in the trade talks that ensued. On June 15, Martin was traded to the Kansas City Athletics. Martin wrote in his autobiography that Stengel <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> him in the eye as the manager told him of the trade. The two, once close friends, rarely spoke in the years to come.|$|E
500|$|On 22 April 1890, {{during the}} run of The Gondoliers, Gilbert {{discovered}} that maintenance expenses for the theatre, including a new £500 carpet for the front lobby of the theatre, were being charged to the partnership instead of borne by Carte. [...] Gilbert confronted Carte, and Carte refused to reconsider the accounts: Even though {{the amount of the}} charge was not great, Gilbert felt it was a moral issue involving Carte's integrity, and he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> past it. [...] Gilbert {{wrote in a letter to}} Sullivan that [...] "I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen". [...] Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte [...] "in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial." [...] Gilbert brought a lawsuit, but Sullivan sided with Carte, who was building the Royal English Opera House, the inaugural production of which was to be Sullivan's forthcoming grand opera. [...] Gilbert won the suit, but the partnership disbanded.|$|E

500|$|Chopra found Mary Kom a {{very special}} and {{personal}} film due to the inspiring theme. She revealed that she channelled the grief of father's death into the film: [...] "I started this film at the hardest point in my life, four days after my father passed away. All my grief, everything, I have shoved into this movie. A part of my soul has gone into it." [...] In an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Chopra revealed that since she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> like her, she {{did not try to}} imitate Kom as her main focus was to represent Kom's spirit and personality. In July 2013, Chopra visited Kom's home town of Manipur to learn more about her life. As part of her research, Chopra stayed with Kom and her family for three to four days, and went to her boxing academy and church to learn more about her. Kom stated, [...] "When she came to Manipur, she knew about boxing so I gave her tips as a mother and a wife, how I went about managing my home and profession, how I live with my family– basically she got to know aspects of my family life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Helgafjell, the [...] "holy {{mountain}}" [...] was {{one idea}} of the afterlife which appears in West Norse sources. This mountain could be a mountain formation in the vicinity, {{and it was so}} sacred that people <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> in its direction without washing their face first. In the holy mountain, the members of the Norse clans would lead lives similar to the ones they had lived {{in the world of the}} living. Some psychic people could look into the mountain and what they saw was not intimidating, but instead it was a scene with a warm hearth, drinking and talking.|$|E

Zeus rescued the unborn Dionysus by sewing him into his thigh. A few months later, Dionysus was born on Mount Pramnos in the island of Ikaria, where Zeus went to release the now-fully-grown baby from his thigh. In this version, Dionysus is born by two [...] "mothers" [...] (Semele and Zeus) before his birth, hence the epithet dimētōr (of two mothers) {{associated}} with his being [...] "twice-born".|$|E
