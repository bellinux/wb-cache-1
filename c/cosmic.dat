5|$|Outside a {{protective}} atmosphere and magnetic field, {{there are few}} obstacles to the passage through space of energetic subatomic particles known as <b>cosmic</b> rays. These particles have energies ranging from about 106eV up to an extreme 1020eV of ultra-high-energy <b>cosmic</b> rays. The peak flux of <b>cosmic</b> rays occurs at energies of about 109eV, with approximately 87% protons, 12% helium nuclei and 1% heavier nuclei. In the high energy range, the flux of electrons is only about 1% of that of protons. <b>Cosmic</b> rays can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers. According to astronauts, like Don Pettit, space has a burned/metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment, similar to the scent of an arc welding torch.|$|E

40|$|The Silicon Strip Detector (SSD) {{forms the}} two {{outermost}} {{layers of the}} ALICE Inner Track- ing System (ITS), connecting the TPC with the inner layers of the ITS. The SSD consists of 1698 double-sided silicon microstrip modules, 95 μm pitch, distributed in two cylindrical bar- rels, whose radii are 38 cm and 43 cm, respectively. With 4. 8 square meters it is today’s largest installed double-sided strip detector. The design and construction will be discussed, both {{in view of the}} requirements of a decade ago and in the light of today’s achieved performance. Like the other LHC detectors, the SSD is waiting for beam after extensive commissioning with <b>cosmics.</b> These commissioning results will be presented. <b>Cosmics</b> data without magnetic field were used for alignment and for relative gain calibration. Together with the measured noise this allowed the signal-to-noise ratio to be determined as well as the charge matching quality. <b>Cosmics</b> data collected with magnetic field were used for energy-loss calibratio...|$|R
5|$|Alvarez {{proposed}} Muon tomography in 1965 {{to search}} the Egyptian pyramids for unknown chambers. Using naturally occurring <b>cosmic</b> rays, his scheme was to place spark chambers, standard equipment in the high-energy particle physics of this time, beneath the second pyramid of Chephren in a known chamber. By measuring the counting rate of the <b>cosmic</b> rays in different directions the detector would reveal the existence of any void in the overlaying rock structure.|$|E
5|$|An inflationary phase, an {{additional}} phase of strongly accelerated expansion at <b>cosmic</b> times of around 10−33 seconds, was hypothesized in 1980 {{to account for}} several puzzling observations that were unexplained by classical cosmological models, such as the nearly perfect homogeneity of the <b>cosmic</b> background radiation. Recent measurements of the <b>cosmic</b> background radiation {{have resulted in the}} first evidence for this scenario. However, there is a bewildering variety of possible inflationary scenarios, which cannot be restricted by current observations. An even larger question is the physics of the earliest universe, prior to the inflationary phase and close to where the classical models predict the big bang singularity. An authoritative answer would require a complete theory of quantum gravity, which has not yet been developed (cf. the section on quantum gravity, below).|$|E
5|$|As well as {{deflecting}} {{the solar}} wind, the Earth's magnetic field deflects <b>cosmic</b> rays, high-energy charged particles that are mostly {{from outside the}} Solar system.
