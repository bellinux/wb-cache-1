40|$|<b>Call</b> <b>Centres</b> {{represent}} one of {{the fastest}} growing industries today. In a competitive business environment the service delivered by <b>Call</b> <b>Centre</b> <b>operators</b> needs to be quantified and this is achieved through Electronic Performance Monitoring (EPM). This study considered the effects of EPM, and related factors such as job control, task complexity, performance, goal-setting and feedback, on the job satisfaction, organisational commitment and work stress, of <b>Call</b> <b>Centre</b> <b>operators.</b> The impact of these factors on staff turnover, which media reports suggest is very high for many <b>Call</b> <b>Centres,</b> was also considered. A total of 388 participants (265 females, 123 males) completed a voluntary self-report questionnaire. All participants were <b>Call</b> <b>Centre</b> <b>operators</b> who were working in one of 27 <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> across Australia in a variety of industries, including Banking & Finance, IT, Employment, Insurance and Telecommunications. All operators were working in an electronically monitored environment. Regression and path analyses revealed age, that is younger employees, and job dissatisfaction to be the only variables that predicted staff turnover. A positive perception of EPM was predicted by a positive perception of both goal-setting and feedback. It was concluded that while staff turnover was high in the current sample, it was not associated with perceptions of EPM, and other factors appeared to be more important...|$|R

To understand various causes of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> <b>operators</b> turnover we have executed a qualitative as well as quantitative research. In the qualitative research we have interviewed 16 <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> <b>operators</b> focusing on the turnover causes from {{the view of the}} operators. Furthermore we have also interviewed all 3 members of the human resources department. These interviews concerned the functionong of that department as a whole. Finally, we have interviewed a former HR manager of this company, who have shared with us his views about the work, aim and future of the HR department. All these interviews have enabled us to understand what the causes of employee turnover are, and what the members of HR department deal with. In addition, we have executed quantitative research, in which we examined the relation between the rate of employee turnover and age, gender, reaching financial performance goals and work performance. The results of our studies show that there is no statistically significant relationship between age and the operator's termination of employment; length of employment and gender; the time before the termination of the employment relationship on the financial performance goals; nor time effect before [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Primary objective: To {{compare the}} {{everyday}} communication {{of individuals with}} mild and moderate dysarthria and concomitant cognitive-communication impairments following traumatic brain injury (TBI) Methods and procedures: Five participants with mild dysarthria and five with moderate dysarthria following TBI were recorded during telephone service enquiries with bus timetable <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> <b>operators.</b> Transcripts were analysed using exchange structure analysis derived from systemic functional linguistics. Listener comfort ratings were collected using a novel equal appearing interval scale to measure how comfortable people would feel interacting with the participants. Main outcomes and results: Participants with moderate dysarthria were not necessarily penalised for having poorer intelligibility during bus timetable service encounters. While participants with moderate dysarthria were given poorer listener comfort ratings, this {{did not affect the}} way information was exchanged with bus timetable <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> <b>operators.</b> These findings were attributed to the powerful interactional role of TBI participants as customers, the amount of disability awareness training and experience held by <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> <b>operators</b> and the highly structured nature of bus timetable service enquiries. Listener comfort ratings could be predicted with moderate accuracy from intelligibility scores. Conclusions: Service encounters where individuals with TBI are placed in a powerful interactional role of customer may be functional generalization tasks.

5000|$|The {{main reason}} for {{applying}} masking to a data field is to protect data that is classified as personal identifiable data, personal sensitive data or commercially sensitive data, however the data must remain usable {{for the purposes of}} undertaking valid test cycles. It must also look real and appear consistent. It is more common to have masking applied to data that is represented outside of a corporate production system. In other words, where data is needed for the purpose of application development, building program extensions and conducting various test cycles. It is common practice in enterprise computing to take data from the production systems to fill the data component, required for these non-production environments. However the practice is not always restricted to non-production environments. In some organizations, data that appears on terminal screens to <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> <b>operators</b> may have masking dynamically applied based on user security permissions.

Structural equation modelling methods were implemented to establish the model fit of the constructs in the study and to explain structural paths between the variables. Findings showed that POSSU and PBSU are significant predictors of work engagement. PBSU predicted productivity. In addition, engagement mediated the relationship between POSSU/PBSU and productivity. This supports the theoretical context of the job demands-resources (JD-R) model and provides grounds for further exploration of the strengths-based approach (on both organisational and individual levels) as a developmental approach to utilise within organisations to enhance engagement and productivity.

40|$|Abstract Background The dose and time-pattern {{of sitting}} has been {{suggested}} in public health research {{to be an important}} determinant of risk for developing a number of diseases, including cardiovascular disorders and diabetes. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the time-pattern of seated and standing/walking postures amongst male and female <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> <b>operators,</b> on the basis of whole-shift posture recordings, analysed and described by a number of novel variables describing posture variation. Methods Seated vs. standing/walking was recorded using dichotomous inclinometers throughout an entire work shift for 43 male and 97 female <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> <b>operators</b> at 16 <b>call</b> <b>centres.</b> Data were analysed using an extensive set of variables describing occurrence of and switches between seated and standing/walking, posture similarity across the day, and compliance with standard recommendations for computer work. Results The majority of the operators, both male and female, spent more than 80 % of the shift in a seated posture with an average of 10. 4 switches/hour between seated and standing/walking or vice versa. Females spent, on average, 11 % of the day in periods of sustained sitting longer than 1 hour; males 4. 6 % (p = 0. 013). Only 38 % and 11 % of the operators complied with standard recommendations of getting an uninterrupted break from seated posture of at least 5 or 10 minutes, respectively, within each hour of work. Two thirds of all investigated variables showed coefficients of variation between subjects above 0. 5. Since work tasks and contractual break schedules were observed to be essentially similar across operators and across days, this indicates that sedentary behaviours differed substantially between individuals. Conclusions The extensive occurrence of uninterrupted seated work indicates that efforts should be made at <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> - and probably in other settings in the office sector - to introduce more physical variation in terms of standing/walking periods during the work day. We suggest the metrics used in this study for quantifying variation in sedentary behaviour to be of interest even for other dichotomous exposures relevant to occupational and public health, for instance physical activity/inactivity. </p...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{integration}} of telephone and VDU technologies, <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> are not uniform in terms of work organization. It is suggested that diversity can best be understood by reference {{to a range of}} quantitative and qualitative characteristics. Consequently, perspectives that treat all <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> {{as if they were the}} same hybrids of customization and routinization are rejected, along with over-optimistic interpretations of labour control over work organization. Empirical evidence from nine `workflows' in two <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> - an established financial sector organization and a rapidly growing outsourced operation - provide excellent grounds for an examination of similarity and difference. A picture emerges of workflows which are volume-driven and routinized, involving low levels of employee discretion, and, by contrast, those less dominated by quantitative criteria offering higher levels of operator discretion and an emphasis on the quality of customer service. Despite these distinctions, larger numbers of operators report an experience of work which is driven by quantitative imperatives, most manifest in the pervasive implementation of targets. Targets are also used increasingly to assess and mould the quality of the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> <b>operator's</b> interaction with the customer. Overall, the evidence casts doubt on the optimistic perspective that <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> work, in time, will come to resemble `knowledge work'...|$|R
40|$|This study {{adopts a}} corpus-driven {{approach}} to analysing patterns of spoken language use of operators and {{customers in the}} <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> industry. The data analysed come from a specialized corpus of inbound (i. e. from the USA) telephone service encounters collected in the Philippines. The paper employs some of the methodologies of corpus-driven analyses that are of practical relevance to practitioners in the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> industry. It demonstrates {{the ways in which}} the findings of corpus linguistics research can contribute to our understanding of intercultural workplace communication, and so potentially lead to a better understanding of such communication practices. Some of the most frequently occur- ring patterns of language use are described and discussed in relation to the negotiation of situated meanings and the role played by small culture (Holliday 1999), in particular organizational culture. The contribution of institutionalized participant roles is found to be closely connected with issues of face management by operators and customers. It is shown that these patterns of language use can also help to identify key aspects of the communication process.
