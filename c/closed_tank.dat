5|$|Preceded by mixed Universal Carrier and {{motorcycle}} reconnaissance detachments, the 192nd and 193rd Regiments {{began moving}} to their designated areas after noon, and arrived there at nightfall. At this point, 192nd Regiment could muster only 295 men, while another 241 {{could not be}} moved by vehicle—presumably due to {{the large number of}} breakdowns and the lack of spare parts—and were ordered to proceed to Kilkis. Shortly after 17:00, about 45 German planes bombed the 192nd Regiment at the village of Theodorovo. Two officers and 15 men were killed, over 50 personnel were wounded, while two Carriers, ten Austins and ten motorcycles were destroyed, effectively destroying the 2nd Open Tank Company as a combat formation. Col. Sionidis' command, which was also in the village, suffered 13 dead and 45 wounded. Despite these losses, the 192nd Regiment reached its assigned positions, where it divided in two Resistance Centres: left, with the Tank Battalion and one of the 47mm anti-tank troops, and the right, with the Foot Battalion and a 20mm anti-tank troop. First German probing attacks during the night were successfully repelled. 193rd Regiment was more fortunate; it reached its deployment area without major obstacles, although a reconnaissance patrol clashed with the Germans near Kato Sourmena, and returned with a German prisoner. On the same evening, the division's 3.7cm Flak shot down a German reconnaissance plain over Krisia railway station, and reconnaissance patrols reported German infiltration along the entire line of the railway track between Mouries and Rodopoli. During the night, the division was allocated reinforcements from the 1st Security Battalion of Thessaloniki in the form of two infantry companies (one for each of the 192nd and 193rd Regiments), two MG squads and a 75mm battery. In order to reconstitute the 192nd Regiment's 2nd Open Tank Company, divisional command ordered the crews of the two Italian-equipped <b>Closed</b> <b>Tank</b> Companies to abandon their vehicles and help man the Universal Carriers. The Italian tanks were hence abandoned and took no part in the fighting, but the reorganization of the 2nd Open Tank Company was not completed until April 8. 191st Regiment was also ordered to send a squadron of its Tank Company to the Rupel Pass.|$|E

40|$|This {{work has}} studied the {{hydraulic}} and thermodynamics of <b>closed</b> surge <b>tanks</b> for hydropower plants. Surge tanks are applied in hydropower plants to control and reduce the acceleration forces of the water during change of turbine flow. Surge tanks reduce the design pressure of the tunnel and pipes that convey water from the reservoir to the turbines, and enable automatic frequency and power control in the hydropower plant. <b>Closed</b> surge <b>tanks</b> are constructed as underground caverns filled with pressurized air located close to the turbines. The work comprises four different studies. In the first study (1), the benefits and challenges of two different surge tank types, the open and the <b>closed</b> surge <b>tanks,</b> were compared. The state-of-the-art design for these two solutions were described. In the second study (2), a hydraulic scale model of an existing hydropower plant with a <b>closed</b> surge <b>tank</b> was constructed in the scale 1 : 65 in the Hydraulic laboratory at NTNU. A new method for scaling of the absolute pressure in the <b>closed</b> surge <b>tanks</b> was developed and tested. The results of the hydraulic scale model was compared with field measurements from the prototype, and the accuracy was quantified. In the third study (3) the thermodynamics of {{the air in the}} <b>closed</b> surge <b>tank</b> was investigated. The impact of heat transfer from the air to the surrounding media was assessed, and different theoretical models for simulation of the thermodynamics where compared with field measurements from an existing hydropower plant. A new improved theoretical model for the thermodynamics was developed and programmed and tested in the freeware hydropower simulation program LVTrans. In the fourth study (4), the effect of installing a surge tank throttle on governor stability, power control and hydraulic transients was investigated. A new method for evaluation of the throttle effect has been developed, and a quantification of the effects for an example hydropower plant with a <b>closed</b> surge <b>tank</b> was conducted...|$|R
50|$|During {{the course}} of the war, German forces added command tanks, {{specialised}} to the task of co-ordinating tank formations. This idea caught on with other nations.

These soon became critical to launching smoke, and post-war smoke dischargers became common on tanks.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model of a}} hydraulic system with a <b>closed</b> surge <b>tank</b> is developed for evaluating the thermodynamic behavior during slow transients in the air pocket. The {{numerical model}} is {{used to evaluate the}} polytrophic equation against a Modified Rational Heat Transfer (MRHT) method, and the results are compared to field observations. The original RHT method considers heat transfer to walls and water as a lumped quantity, and the method is modified in this work to evaluate these two processes separately. The field observation dataset contains pressure and water level measurements from a 3, 050 [*][*]m 33, 050 [*][*]m 3 <b>closed</b> surge <b>tank</b> during a pressure increase from 805 to 1543 kPa over 40 min, thus providing a unique opportunity to investigate the thermodynamic behavior during slow transients.

Hydraulically blown organ pipes were used to imitate birdsong, and musicologists Susi Jeans and Arthur W.J.G. Ord-Hume have suggested that it was used to create the sounds of the Vocal Memnon. For the latter, solar heat was used to syphon water from one <b>closed</b> <b>tank</b> into another, thereby producing compressed air for sounding the pipes.|$|E

5000|$|Explanation:Water {{runs from}} the top over the surface (1), and the {{hydropneumatic}} controller takes {{over control of the}} water flow. The water, which runs over the surface, is collected in a catch basin (2). In order to make running fresh water out from a <b>closed</b> <b>tank</b> (5), it requires air. The water pressure suctions the air from the catch basin via a hose (3). Here the dripping water can close the hose and thereby, through under-pressure in the water tank (5), stops running out of the water tank. The filling process is stopped immediately and is restarted in relation to the humidity of the air. Contamination is once more suppressed, because dripped water immediately evaporates in the lime separator and, if necessary, in the humidity poster.Humidification posters: ...|$|E
