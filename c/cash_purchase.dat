25|$|The {{clothing}} that the then-unidentified victim wore, Faded Glory, was traced to Walmart, its exclusive retailer. They were presumed {{to have been}} purchased in Naperville, at a Walmart store near where the body was found. The company assisted with the investigation, as it released for review all records of purchases of the items; only one sale could not be traced, {{as it was a}} <b>cash</b> <b>purchase.</b> The child's footprints were taken and compared to those from hospitals in the area, but did not match any of the records.

The analysis also indicated that his mother had lived {{in the northern part of}} the continent, where she spent most of her pregnancy.|$|E

He recognized that the attacks would make U.S. foreign policy more aggressive, which he believed was counter-productive.

50|$|Although {{the name}} implies that reinvesting {{dividends}} is {{the main purpose of}} these plans, many companies offer a complementary share purchase plan (SPP).

Low-fee or no-fee SPPs may be advantageous to enrollees as they offer a quick and cost-effective way to increase their holdings.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{was to determine if}} <b>cash</b> <b>purchased</b> supreme alfalfa hay in Tulare, CA could be cross-hedged by dairy farmers with a single commodity that is exchanged on the board in order to manage the volatility of alfalfa prices. The first objective was to find commodities that are traded on the board that could potentially be used to cross-hedge <b>cash</b> <b>purchased</b> or grown alfalfa. Three commodities that are similar to alfalfa were selected. The commodities were soybeans, soybean meal, and No. 2 yellow corn. The fourth commodity used was crude oil because fuel is a large cost in the farming of alfalfa. Monthly average futures contract prices and monthly average cash prices of all of the commodities were found from 2005 to 2013. The monthly average cash prices paid to farmers in California and the U. S., the monthly average cash prices paid for alfalfa in the U.

The data was analyzed to see if the price variance of supreme alfalfa in Tulare, CA has a strong relationship to the commodities price fluctuations.
