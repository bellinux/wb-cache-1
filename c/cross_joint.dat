The hospital project gained approval in November. Next, French military authorization had to be obtained for a hospital building and for permits granting the British hospital personnel's entry into France. Lacking more suitable alternatives in proximity to the French coastline, the Bromley-Martin hospital slated its installation for an empty château in rural eastern France. In December the building, the hospital proposal and the British staff were approved for service by French Minister of War Alexandre Millerand and Service de Santé chief, Dr Ange François Troussaint.|$|E

This thesis analytically investigates the relationships among <b>cross</b> <b>joint</b> geometry, orientations and ratios of remote principal stresses, and fluid pressure.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between propagating joints and embedded concretions in a Devonian black shale near Seneca Lake, NY, permits {{identification of the}} loading configurations responsible for two joint sets of dierent ages striking at nearly the same orientation. The earlier set consists of systematic joints cut by later Alleghanian joints of the Appalachian Plateau. The later set consists of non-systematic curving <b>cross</b> <b>joints</b> that abut these same Alleghanian joints. Field evidence shows that concretions functioned as sti inclusions in a compliant black shale. As a consequence of this elastic contrast, local perturbations in the remote stress field persisted around the concretions during burial, tectonic deformation, and exhumation. These stress perturbations influenced joint propagation paths of both joint sets. Our conclusions about loading configurations are based on finite-element modeling of the eect of the local stress perturbation on concretion-modified joint propagation. Modeling shows that the local stress perturbation from a thermoelastic loading was responsible for deflecting <b>cross</b> <b>joints</b> away from concretions in a curved propagation path near the concretion. This load configuration also led to arrest of <b>cross</b> <b>joints</b> before they penetrated the shale–concretion interface. At greater distances from the concretion, the propagation path of <b>cross</b> <b>joints</b> was controlled by the contemporary tectonic stress field. The interface between concretions and the surrounding shale was strongly bonded, {{as indicated by the}} crossing of the interface by some of the systematic ENE joints.

40|$|AbstractThe load {{capacity}} of fillet welds is investigated experimentally and numerically in <b>cross</b> <b>joint</b> specimens {{with the objective}} of calibrating multiple failure criteria for the ductile fracture of weld metal. The <b>cross</b> <b>joint</b> specimens are composed of mild shipbuilding steel with plate thicknesses of 20 mm and 30 mm respectively. The fillet welds are manually produced by flux-cored arc welding, using the filler metal Elgacore MXX 100. To achieve different stress states in the weld joints, forces in two different directions and moments about two different axes are applied separately on various specimens. A uniquely designed specimen is employed for each load scenario. For the numerical investigations, an appropriate discretization of the weld joints is established by taking into account the distribution of the metallographic structure with the weld metal and the heat-affected zone. The distribution of the different materials is determined by a macrosection of a weld joint. The material behavior, in terms of true stress-strain curves for the weld metal and the material of the heat-affected zone, is identified by hardness measurements. With the established discretization of the weld joints and true stress-strain curves of the different materials, the experimentally determined force-displacement curves are reproduced in finite element analyses. Furthermore, the Gurson (1977) damage model are successfully calibrated for the weld metal...|$|E

3000|$|Hip {{distraction}} using <b>cross</b> <b>joint</b> articulated external fixation {{has been}} used by a number of orthopaedic centres for the treatment of osteoarthritis, chrondrolysis, and osteonecrosis, as an alternative to hip arthroplasty or arthrodesis in the adolescent and young adults [...]. The hip, however, is problematic with respect to external fixation, as it lies deep, surrounded by powerful muscles and in intimate contact with major neurovascular structures and intrapelvic organs. The numbers of patients treated by this technique to date remains small and the technical detail and potential complications, with respect to the application of the external fixation, unclear. In this study we used anatomical information from CT scans combined with computer modelling of the hip and pelvis to identify safe screw positions in the periacetabular region. The surgical insertion of the pins was then performed on five cadavers and anatomical dissections undertaken to confirm the structures at risk. This study indicated that whilst {{there are a number of}} anatomic constraints, it is still possible to insert three pins with good divergence into the limited bony corridor of the peri-acetabular region recognising that the more posterior of the laterally inserted pins poses a potential risk to the sciatic nerve if not inclined away from the sciatic notch.|$|E
40|$|Though early {{medieval and}} modern architecture, studied by ethnographers, is fairly well known, {{there is a}} gap in our {{knowledge}} of building in the Late Middle Ages. It was only {{with the development of}} historical archaeology, first directed towards the study of defensive features, residential architecture, castles and finally towns that the interest in single constructions or whole architectural complexes began to grow. The studies performed so far show that in the Late Middle Ages three basic constructional types existed side by side: 1) houses with <b>cross</b> <b>joint</b> logs corners (block construction); 2) houses with walls of short timber planks tenoned into the slots of vertical posts; 3) timber-framed houses. For lack of adequate data {{it is not possible to}} assess their respective proportions or the preponderance of any of them. Presumably various factors such as character of settlement, natural environment, limitation of timber felling and also regional specificity, already distinct at that time, had played a part. It is also possible to assume that a two-room house with a central entrance lobby began to appear in the early 13 th century. It seems that in the Late Middle Ages the importance of block construction (type 1), outstanding in the preceding periods, did not decline, though this type began to disappear relatively early from urban settlement. That period witnessed a sort of revival of the second constructional type only occasional in the Early Middle Ages, but fairly common in prehistoric times. The timber-frame-and-board construction (type 3), recorded in Poland about the mid- 13 th century, is best documented at Pułtusk. It was inspired by the palisade type called stav - Stabbau, a more developed form of which was earlier known in Germany and Scandinavia. This construction seems to have been employed in late medieval towns and preceded houses built on a timber frame with wattle-and-daub walls, which began to appear only in the 14 th- 15 th centuries. Gdansk, where because of its specificity, houses with brick-nogged timber walls appeared much earlier, is an exception.

40|$|Bulge forming is a {{manufacturing}} {{process that is}} becoming increasingly important as a technology {{that can be used}} to produce seamless, lightweight and near-net-shape industrial components. The process is being increasingly applied in the automotive and aerospace industries where the demands for increased structural strength and decreased vehicle weight make it a very attractive manufacturing method. This work is concerned with increasing knowledge of the deformation mechanisms during bulge forming processes using numerical simulation. A number of complex bulge forming operations which have not been satisfactorily analysed in published research were identified and subsequently analysed using commercial finite element software. A non-linear explicit solution method was used in each case. The processes chosen for simulation were: hydraulic bulge forming of cross joints, bulge forming using a solid bulging medium, bulge forming of bimetallic tubes and the behaviour of the die during these bulge forming processes. In each case a number of process parameters were varied and their effect on the process identified. Where possible the finite element results were validated against results from experimental trials. It was found that the simulations predicted the experimental results with accuracy, thus indicating that the models developed here can be used with confidence to predict the behaviour of bulge forming operations. From the results of the finite element simulations it was concluded that when designing processes to bulge form <b>cross</b> <b>joint</b> components that compressive axial loading should be used in conjunction with pressure loading where possible, friction between the die and workpiece should be kept to a minimum where maximum branch height is required and greater tube thickness should be used when seeking to reduce stress and thinning behaviour in the formed component. The results also indicate that, where possible a solid bulging medium should be used as it results in much more favorable forming conditions, which can allow the realisation of greater branch heights. The simulations of bulge forming of bimetallic tubes showed that the relative thickness of the two metal layers has a significant effect on the shape of the final component. It was also found that varying the relative strength of the two metallic layers had a significant effect on the branch height obtained. The development of stress in the die during various bulge forming process was detailed at various stages during the process. It was found that generally a stress concentration moves towards the die bend as the process progresses. The effect of using different die materials was examined and it was concluded that certain materials are unsuitable for use as die materials due to the fact that their yield stress is exceeded during the forming process...|$|E
