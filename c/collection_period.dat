5|$|In 1972, {{the company}} {{collected}} NOK3.07 million in tolls, 21% more than estimated. By 1977, the annual income had reached NOK5.03 million, which was up 28% from the estimates. From 1978, the tolls for people were removed, resulting in about NOK1 million less revenue per year. One {{of the reasons}} for the removal of passenger tolls was the extra time used to count passengers, which increased the queues at the toll plaza, and that the company's debt would be covered anyway, even without the extra revenue. From 1 January 1981, scheduled buses were also exempt from tolls, under the condition that the funds saved were used by the bus companies to strengthen public transport on Sotra. From 1980, there was disagreement within the company as to whether the toll period should be extended to increase the subsidies to projects on Sotra and Øygarden, or if an as short as possible <b>collection</b> <b>period</b> was desirable. The board decided to terminate toll collections from 31 December 1983. A minority of the owners wanted to extend the period for another two years, which would have given an estimated additional NOK20 million.|$|E

2500|$|Space-based {{solar power}} (SBSP) {{is the concept}} of {{collecting}} solar power in outer space and distributing it to Earth. Potential advantages of collecting solar energy in space include a higher collection rate and a longer <b>collection</b> <b>period</b> {{due to the lack of}} a diffusing atmosphere, and the possibility of placing a solar collector in an orbiting location where there is no night. A considerable fraction of incoming solar energy (55–60%) is lost on its way through the Earth's atmosphere by the effects of reflection and absorption. Space-based solar power systems convert sunlight to microwaves outside the atmosphere, avoiding these losses, and the downtime due to the Earth's rotation, but at great cost due to the expense of launching material into orbit. SBSP is considered a form of sustainable or green energy, renewable energy, and is occasionally considered among climate engineering proposals. [...] It is attractive to those seeking large-scale solutions to anthropogenic climate change or fossil fuel depletion (such as peak oil).|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, the Public Road Administration took {{initiative}} for the Askøy Bridge {{to use the}} Autopass electronic toll collection system. The national standard was planned implemented simultaneously in the Bergen Toll Ring, the Askøy Bridge and the Osterøy Bridge. This eliminated {{the need for a}} manned booth and allowed cars to pass without stopping. The cost-saving would allow the toll <b>collection</b> <b>period</b> to end one month early. Autopass would allow for an annual saving of NOK6 million. [...] The proposal resulted in opposition from a group of locals, who collected 9,000 signatures in a petition to keep the manual collection system. The old system allowed people to purchase discounted tickets for NOK60. While people who signed an agreement with Askøybrua AS were granted the same discount, this would not be true for people who had an agreement with other toll companies, and did not sign an additional agreement to receive the discount. The petitioners were concerned that they no longer could purchase tickets for friends visiting them from the mainland, as these would only receive the discount if they signed an agreement with Askøybrua. On 22 December, the toll company voted to introduce a dual system which would both allow Autopass and the old tickets, although it would be a more costly system to operate. On 23 January 2004, the Public Roads Administration announced that they would allow all cars with an Autopass chip to receive the 30 percent discount, even if they had an agreement with a different toll company. Autopass was introduced on 2 February.|$|E

Data were collected onboard HSV- 2 SWIFT during four periods from May 2004 to April 2005. HSV- 2 SWIFT was chosen to examine performance on a high speed vessel with a catamaran hull type and a small crew. Data were collected using handheld personal digital assistants (PDAs) with a performance task along with questionnaires. There is a possibility that crewmember cognitive performance, as measured by Lapses on the Psychomotor Vigilance Task, may be related to reported Motion Sickness.
