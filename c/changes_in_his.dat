5|$|Docter {{first began}} {{developing}} Inside Out in 2010, after noticing <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> daughter's personality as she grew older. The film's producers consulted numerous psychologists including Dacher Keltner from the University of California, Berkeley, who helped revise the story {{by emphasizing the}} neuropsychological findings that human emotions affect interpersonal relationships and can be significantly moderated by them.|$|E
5|$|After his two Brier seasons, Martin {{did not win}} {{the provincial}} title again until 1995. In the meantime, he had made some line-up <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> team, and by the 1995 Labatt Brier, he had settled on James Pahl as his second, {{retaining}} Park and Bartlett as his third and lead, respectively. At the 1995 Brier, he placed in third after the round robin with a 7–4 win-loss record, tied with Ontario and Prince Edward Island. Martin knocked off Ontario's Ed Werenich in the page playoffs 3 vs. 4 match, but lost to Kerry Burtnyk's Manitoba rink in the semifinal with a score of 9–3.|$|E
5|$|Also in the off-season, Gillis fired Luongo's goaltending coach Ian Clark {{and hired}} Roland Melanson in his place. Luongo {{had been a}} {{personal}} friend of Clark's and publicly stated being surprised and disappointed with the switch. The decision to hire Melanson was largely precipitated on his willingness to work with Luongo on a full-time basis – something Clark was unable to do. Despite the coaching change at the club level, Luongo retained Clark as his personal coach for his summer training. He began working with Melanson {{leading up to the}} 2010–11 season and employed several <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> playing style, which included playing deeper into his crease instead of challenging shooters.|$|E

5|$|Despite a life {{filled with}} bad luck—having Tourette syndrome, {{being struck by}} lightning, and losing one of his {{testicles}} to cancer—Harvie remains optimistic, living out his own eccentric way of life. In one of the pivotal episodes of his life, Harvie sits in the park next to a statue of Horace while he hears the instructional Carpe diem, which inspires him to make many <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life, such as embracing nudism and embarking on daring rescue missions for animal rights. He marries Val, a nurse he meets in hospital, and they adopt a daughter, Ruby, who has deformed limbs due {{to the effects of}} thalidomide.|$|E
5|$|Out of Exile was {{released}} internationally on May 23, 2005, then {{a day later}} in the U.S. It debuted {{at the top of}} the Billboard 200 chart, the only Audioslave album to reach this position. The following week, however, it dropped to number three, with a 62-percent sales decrease—consequently reaching platinum. Cornell admitted to writing his most personal songs ever on this album, influenced by the positive <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life since 2002. He also described the album as more varied than the debut and relying less on heavy guitar riffs.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} be issued an {{identity}} card, one needs to fill in a form, which {{should be taken to}} the Identity Documents and Passport Regime Units within the District Police Stations. The forms could be obtained at all District Police Stations. When applying the name, gender, date and place of birth, digital image, ten fingerprints, palmprints, and an electronic signature in a JPEG2000 format are taken. First-time appliers must also provide a valid birth certificate. It is possible for a person to apply for a renewal of the ID card via a representative with a notary signed permit, provided there are no significant <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> or hers appearance. There are, however limitations. If you apply via a representative, you must receive the new ID yourself. Vice versa, if you applied yourself, then an authorized representative may receive your ID. This does not apply to applying for passports, as fingerprints must be taken.|$|E

5|$|The tenth season closes several long-running storylines. Charlie {{breaks up}} with Ross {{to get back}} {{together}} with her ex-boyfriend. Joey and Rachel try to contend with Ross' feelings about them being together and decide {{it would be best}} to remain friends. Phoebe and Mike get married mid-season outside the Central Perk coffee house. Monica and Chandler apply to adopt a child and are chosen by Erica (Anna Faris). In the series finale, Erica gives birth to twins, to the surprise of Monica and Chandler— a boy, Jack (after Monica's father), and a girl, Erica (named after the birth mother). Monica and Chandler prepare to move to the suburbs, and Joey becomes upset with the <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life. Rachel gets fired from her job and accepts a new offer in Paris, but Ross, realizing he loves her, chases after her. Rachel realizes she loves him, too, and cancels her flight to Paris, agreeing to stay with him. The series ends with all the friends plus Monica and Chandler's new babies leaving the apartment, heading to Central Perk for a final cup of coffee. The finale dialogue used in this series is by Chandler, making a joke for the last time. The camera's last view is of all of the character's keys to the apartment on the counter table, finishing with a shot of the apartment door.|$|E
5|$|Putnam has {{consistently}} {{adhered to the}} idea of semantic holism, in spite of the many <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> other positions. The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E

Though he continued his earlier themes, Bellows also began to receive portrait commissions, {{as well as social}} invitations, from New York's wealthy elite. Additionally, he followed Henri's lead and began to summer in Maine, painting seascapes on Monhegan and Matinicus islands.|$|E

25|$|Richter died at Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow from a {{heart attack}} on August 1, 1997 aged 82.

At the time of his death, he was rehearsing Schubert's Fünf Klavierstücke, D. 459.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1865, {{his public}} {{behaviour}} became irritating and embarrassing to his associates. He {{also began to}} drink immoderately; he spent progressively more time away from his family, sometimes {{in the company of}} a prostitute; and his wife noticed <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> sexual behavior. On July 13, 1865, the Semmelweis family visited friends, and during the visit Semmelweis's behavior seemed particularly inappropriate.|$|E
25|$|Sunny Adé's musical sound {{has evolved}} from the early days. His career began with Moses Olaiya's Federal Rhythm Dandies, a highlife band.

25|$|Hokusai {{was known}} {{by at least}} thirty names during his lifetime. While the use of {{multiple}} names was a common practice of Japanese artists of the time, his number of pseudonyms exceeds that of any other major Japanese artist. Hokusai's name changes are so frequent, and so often related to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> artistic production and style, that they are used for breaking his life up into periods.|$|E
25|$|Still {{offended}} by the <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> story for Flower and Snake, Dan refused {{to participate in the}} follow-up to that film, Wife to be Sacrificed. In interviews, Dan claimed that this second film, which proved even more successful than Flower and Snake, was based on a story he had written, but that he had insisted his name be removed from the credits. Director Masaru Konuma, however, says that it was an original story by Yozo Tanaka.|$|E

He wrote the original text {{in reaction to the}} optimism of his father and his father's associates (notably Rousseau) regarding the future improvement of society. Malthus also constructed his case as a specific response to writings of William Godwin (1756–1836) and of the Marquis de Condorcet (1743–1794).|$|E
