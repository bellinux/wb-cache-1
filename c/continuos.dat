En el centro había una grande hoguera alimentada con palmas secas, alrededor de la cual se agitaba la rueda de danzantes, y otra de espectadores, danzantes á su turno, mucho más numerosa, cerraba á ocho metros de distancia el gran círculo. Allí se confundian hombres y mujeres, viejos y muchachos, y en un punto de esa segunda rueda se encontraba la tremenda orquesta... Ocho parejas bailaban al compás del son ruidoso, monótono, incesante, de la gaita (pequeña flauta de sonidos muy agudos y con solo siete agujeros) y del tamboril, instrumento cónico, semejante á un pan de azúcar, muy estrecho, que produce un ruido profundo como el eco de un cerro y se toca con las manos á fuerza de redobles <b>continuos.</b> La carraca (caña de chonta, acanalada trasversalmente, y cuyo ruido se produce frotándola á compás con un pequeño hueso delgado); el triángulo de fierro, que es conocido, y el chucho ó alfandoque (caña cilíndrica y hueca, dentro de la cual se agitan multitud de pepas que, a los sacudones del artista, producen un ruido sordo y áspero como el del hervor de una cascada), se mezclaban rarísimamente al concierto.

Multiple objective optimization problems have recently received considerable attention specially by the evolutionary algorithms community. Their proposals, however, require an adequate codification of the problem into strings, which {{is not always easy}} to do. This paper introduces a new algorithm, called MDQL, for multiple objective optimization problems which does not suffer from previous limitations. MDQL is based on a new distributed Q-learning algorithm, called DQL, which is also introduced in this paper. Furthermore, an extension for applying reinforcement learning to <b>continuos</b> functions is also given. Successful results of MDQL on a <b>continuos</b> non restricted problem whose Pareto front is convex and on a <b>continuos</b> non-convex problem with restrictions are described. 1 Introduction Many {{problems can}} be characterized by several non-commensurable and often competing measures of performance or objectives [...] . ...|$|E
