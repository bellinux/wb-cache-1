As hydro-geological conditions of the mine are extremely complicated, <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> inrush happened twice during excavation of the ventilation shaft in 2006 and 2009 respectively. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to control <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> inrush and guide the safety production of the mine. Hence, <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> state was firstly analyzed through the data of borehole and hydrologic geology. After that, hydro-geological models of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> system were built up. According to the hydro-geological models, mathematical models of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> were established. With the help of the software of Processing Modflow for Windows (PMWIN), the numerical model of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> was set up. Then, by using the SOR (Successive Over-Relaxation) iterative method, the numerical equations were solved. Finally, <b>the</b> district <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> inflow rate on the main mining levels and the dangerous districts of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> inrush was figured out. The results of the numerical solution are significant to <b>the</b> control of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> inrush in <b>the</b> Baixiangshan iron mine...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the principal part of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> investigation carried out from 1964 to 1969 in the Kamenose landslide area, Osaka Prefecture, Japan. The investigation of infiltration and runoff with an infiltrometer and runoff plot, {{and through the}} analysis of the direct runoff of the stream in this area revealed that <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge accounts for about sixty percent of the rainfall. The results of the observation of the water level and the sounding of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow in <b>the</b> boreholes were compared with the geological structure based on the test boring, and it is shown that <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> can be treated as phreatic water.

40|$|Land {{reclamation}} {{has been}} a common practice to produce valuable land in coastal areas. The impact of land reclamation on coastal environment and marine ecology is well recognized and widely studied. It has not been recognized yet that reclamation may change <b>the</b> regional <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> regime, which may in turn modify the coastal environment, flooding pattern, and stability of slopes and foundations. This paper represents the first attempt to examine quantitatively the effect of reclamation on <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> levels. Analytical solutions are developed to study <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> change in response to reclamation based on two hypothetical models. In the first model, <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow regime changes only in the hillside around the reclamation areas. In the second model, <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> regime changes in the entire hill. Both models assume that <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow is in a steady state and satisfies the Dupuit assumptions. Hypothetical examples are used to demonstrate how <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> level, <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> divide and <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> submarine discharge will change with the scale and hydraulic conductivity of the reclamation materials. The results show that <b>the</b> change of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> regime depends mainly {{on the length of}} the reclaimed area and the values of hydraulic conductivity of the reclaimed materials. It is also seen that the reclamation may impact not only <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> regime near <b>the</b> coast areas around the reclamation site, but also that in the coast areas opposite the reclamation area. A reclamation site near Tseung K wan 0 in the New Territories in Hong Kong, China, is used as a case study to discuss the possible modification of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> system caused by reclamation...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>water</b> {{flow regime}} of the Kamenose {{landslide}} area in Osaka Prefecture was investigatedfrom 1964 to 1969 {{as a part}} of a synthetic research of the Kamenose landslide. The results of theinvestigations of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> level and <b>the</b> geological structure suggested that <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> waterin this area can be treated as phreatic water. It was also confirmed by the result of <b>the</b> logging ofthe <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow in <b>the</b> boreholes. <b>The</b> distribution of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> storage can be givenfrom a contour map of the water table and a geological map showing the thickness of permeablelayer (mainly weathered andesite). The path of significant <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow was estimatedthrough <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> tracing and <b>the</b> geochemical investigation of land waters. It was foundthat <b>the</b> main <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> vein exists in the zone where the landslide motion was significant. Theresult of the investigation of water balance in the watershed of a brook in the landslide area showedthat the net recharge of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> accounts for about 60 % of the annual precipitation. Thedischarge of the springs and the artificial drainage works, and the base flow of the brook in thewatershed are summed up and compared with <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge. It is shown that about 60 % of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge flows away without appearing on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> surface in this area. It is generally said that <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water.</b> Flow in landslide areas usually exists as <b>ground</b> waterveins in <b>the</b> underground channels. It is demonstrated that, in such a case, distribution of thepotential of <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> direction of significant flow, and water balance of each part of thewatershed must firstly be investigated to know the fundamental network of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow,and to know, then, its more detailed structure through further investigations...|$|R

40|$|As basic {{research}} for the study on the seepage water control in the paddy field, the following topics are dealed: (1) Effect of the seepage rate from paddy field on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> level. (2) Effect of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> level on <b>the</b> seepage rate from paddy field. In <b>the</b> first topic, <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> level was obtained by the solution of Boussinesq 2 Ì 7 s equation based on the Dupuit 2 Ì 7 s assumption. This solution was compared with experiments and {{it was found that}} there are the cases in which the Dupuit 2 Ì 7 s assumption is not valid. In these cases, problems may be analyzed by numerical method. In the second topic, experiments were carried out relating to the change of the seepage rate with the change of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> level.

This can be verified by studying the genetic systems of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> aquifers and most of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> samples source in an area of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge. <b>The</b> environmental stable isotopes oxygen and hydrogen (18 O, and deuterium) were studied and used to identify the sources of recharge. <b>The</b> studied <b>ground</b> <b>waters</b> are enriched in D and 18 O and the isotopic features suggest that most of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharged indirectly after evaporation prior to infiltration from irrigation return water as well as the contribution from Nile water...|$|R
40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} of {{the occurrence of}} boron in <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> of an area in the southeastern San Joaquin Valley. Geologic and hydrologic factors affecting the distribution of boron are established. The area selected for study lies wholly within the Arvin-Edison Water Storage District of Kern County, California. Four sets of boron data and water-level data are compared, results indicating conditions from 1929 to 1966. The effect of ground-water movement on boron occurrence is discussed. The subsurface lithology {{of the study area}} is defined through the use of electric logs and other data. The foothill area northeast of the study area is related to the occurrence of boron in <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> of <b>the</b> study area. A model is constructed to describe the present distribution of boron in <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> of <b>the</b> study area. The dilution effect of Caliente Creek recharge is important with regard to boron concentrations in <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water.</b> <b>The</b> effect of subsurface lithology and processes such as sorption on boron content are discussed. Chemical analyses from 1966 are used to substantiate concepts developed in this report...|$|R
