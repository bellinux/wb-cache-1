As hydro-geological conditions of the mine are extremely complicated, <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> inrush happened twice during excavation of the ventilation shaft in 2006 and 2009 respectively. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to control <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> inrush and guide the safety production of the mine. Hence, <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> state was firstly analyzed through the data of borehole and hydrologic geology. After that, hydro-geological models of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> system were built up. According to the hydro-geological models, mathematical models of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> were established. With the help of the software of Processing Modflow for Windows (PMWIN), the numerical model of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> was set up. Then, by using the SOR (Successive Over-Relaxation) iterative method, the numerical equations were solved. Finally, <b>the</b> district <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> inflow rate on the main mining levels and the dangerous districts of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> inrush was figured out. The results of the numerical solution are significant to <b>the</b> control of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> inrush in <b>the</b> Baixiangshan iron mine...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the principal part of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> investigation carried out from 1964 to 1969 in the Kamenose landslide area, Osaka Prefecture, Japan. The investigation of infiltration and runoff with an infiltrometer and runoff plot, {{and through the}} analysis of the direct runoff of the stream in this area revealed that <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge accounts for about sixty percent of the rainfall. The results of the observation of the water level and the sounding of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow in <b>the</b> boreholes were compared with the geological structure based on the test boring, and it is shown that <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> can be treated as phreatic water.

40|$|Land {{reclamation}} {{has been}} a common practice to produce valuable land in coastal areas. The impact of land reclamation on coastal environment and marine ecology is well recognized and widely studied. It has not been recognized yet that reclamation may change <b>the</b> regional <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> regime, which may in turn modify the coastal environment, flooding pattern, and stability of slopes and foundations. This paper represents the first attempt to examine quantitatively the effect of reclamation on <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> levels. Analytical solutions are developed to study <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> change in response to reclamation based on two hypothetical models. In the first model, <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow regime changes only in the hillside around the reclamation areas. In the second model, <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> regime changes in the entire hill. Both models assume that <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow is in a steady state and satisfies the Dupuit assumptions. Hypothetical examples are used to demonstrate how <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> level, <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> divide and <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> submarine discharge will change with the scale and hydraulic conductivity of the reclamation materials. The results show that <b>the</b> change of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> regime depends mainly {{on the length of}} the reclaimed area and the values of hydraulic conductivity of the reclaimed materials. It is also seen that the reclamation may impact not only <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> regime near <b>the</b> coast areas around the reclamation site, but also that in the coast areas opposite the reclamation area. A reclamation site near Tseung K wan 0 in the New Territories in Hong Kong, China, is used as a case study to discuss the possible modification of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> system caused by reclamation...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>water</b> {{flow regime}} of the Kamenose {{landslide}} area in Osaka Prefecture was investigatedfrom 1964 to 1969 {{as a part}} of a synthetic research of the Kamenose landslide. The results of theinvestigations of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> level and <b>the</b> geological structure suggested that <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> waterin this area can be treated as phreatic water.

The path of significant <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow was estimatedthrough <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> tracing and <b>the</b> geochemical investigation of land waters. It was foundthat <b>the</b> main <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> vein exists in the zone where the landslide motion was significant. Theresult of the investigation of water balance in the watershed of a brook in the landslide area showedthat the net recharge of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> accounts for about 60 % of the annual precipitation. Thedischarge of the springs and the artificial drainage works, and the base flow of the brook in thewatershed are summed up and compared with <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge. It is shown that about 60 % of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge flows away without appearing on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> surface in this area. It is generally said that <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water.</b> Flow in landslide areas usually exists as <b>ground</b> waterveins in <b>the</b> underground channels.
