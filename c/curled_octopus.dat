50|$|Analysis {{carried out}} on the stomach {{contents}} of stranded Risso’s dolphins demonstrates {{that the most important}} species fed on in Scottish waters is the <b>curled</b> <b>octopus.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>curled</b> <b>octopus</b> {{is taken}} as bycatch in trawl {{fisheries}} for other species. It is also captured in earthenware pots in the Mediterranean, although the fishery for curled octopuses {{is less important than}} that of the common octopus. International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) catch data for both the <b>curled</b> <b>octopus</b> and common octopus, from all ICES regions (NE Atlantic) in 2006, indicated around 8,999 tonnes, but more recent estimates indicate a substantial increase to around 19,000 tonnes in 2008 (ICES WGCEPH, 2010). Nearly all landings of both species within these regions are taken by Portugal and Spain, with Spain taking the vast majority, although most of these will be of the common octopus. Neither species is subject to either stock assessment or quota controls in Europe {{and in the case of}} the <b>curled</b> <b>octopus</b> there is no minimum size for landing. In the Adriatic this species is caught and sold alongside Eledone moschata but is the less numerous of the two. It is not regarded as a commercially viable species in Scotland and any caught are normally discarded.|$|E
50|$|The <b>curled</b> <b>octopus</b> (Eledone cirrhosa), {{also known}} as the horned octopus, lesser octopus or {{northern}} octopus, is a species of cephalopod found in the northeast Atlantic, ranging from Norway to the Mediterranean, including the British Isles.|$|E
50|$|They feed almost {{exclusively}} on neritic and oceanic squid, mostly nocturnally. Predation does not appear significant. Mass strandings are infrequent. Analysis carried out on the stomach contents of stranded specimens in Scotland showed {{that the most important}} species preyed on in Scottish waters is the <b>curled</b> <b>octopus.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>curled</b> <b>octopus</b> {{is mainly}} found at depths between 0 and 150 m and may occur down to 800 m. It {{lives in the}} {{northeast}} Atlantic Ocean, including the English Channel, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea. In recent years the North Sea populations have increased, probably due to overfishing of large predatory fish such as Atlantic cod. This has had a knock on effect on crab and lobster fisheries as the <b>curled</b> <b>octopus</b> readily enters pots to take the bait or the catch. In seas of Scotland, E. cirrhosa is infrequently caught when trawling over rocky substrates and are more frequently captured when fishing over sandy or muddy substrates. A survey using different methods found that Eledone cirrhosa was common and widespread throughout the Scottish inshore waters covered by fishing activity, from the shoreline down to 140m, on substrates ranging through rocky, stoney, sandy and muddy. Specimens were caught throughout the year but is most common in inshore waters {{during the summer months}} and moves further offshore to the trawling grounds in October-December.|$|E
5000|$|The {{growth rate}} of the <b>curled</b> <b>octopus</b> is quite rapid and its life span is {{generally}} short at 1-5 years, although {{there may be some}} variation between warmer and colder areas. The <b>curled</b> <b>octopus</b> matures at around 1 year (on reaching a total length of 12 - 40 cm for females, slightly smaller for males) and with 1,000-5,000 eggs laid on average. The females normally attain sexual maturity when they reach a body size of between 400-1000 g but some females weighing up to 1000-1200 g show no evidence of enlargement of the ovaries. The males reach just over 600g and typically have well-developed reproductive organs from around 200g. [...] It breeds at a lower rate than the partially sympatric Octopus vulgaris (common octopus). Populations are apparently at their lowest density in the autumn, probably due to post-spawning die off as reproduction involves females laying eggs, guarding them and dying once the eggs hatch. Curled octopuses are solitary animals, generally inhabiting depths of less than 100 m, and more common in shallow water, but they have been found down to 800 m.|$|E
5000|$|Many animals, {{including}} some octopuses, autotomise limbs when these are injured. This {{is considered to}} be a nociceptive behaviour. After receiving a crushing injury to an arm, algae octopuses autotomise the affected arm and show wound protective behaviours such as wrapping other arms around the wounded arm. These protective responses continue for at least 24 hours. In the long-term, they also show heightened sensitisation at the site of the injury and a reduced threshold to showing escape responses. [...] The <b>curled</b> <b>octopus</b> (Eledone cirrhosa) also shows protective responses to injury. [...] These long-term changes in behaviour suggest that [...] "... some molluscs may be capable not only of nociception and nociceptive sensitization but also of neural states that have some functional similarities to emotional states associated with pain in humans." ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>curled</b> <b>octopus</b> {{feeds on}} crabs {{and other large}} crustaceans, as well as fish. Serological {{analysis}} of the crop of specimens sampled in the Moray Firth and Sound of Jura revealed the main prey to be Liocarcinus spp, Nephrops norvegicus, Cancer pagurus , Crangon crangon and Carcinus maenas, although {{a large proportion of}} the samples analysed did not react in the tests suggesting they had consumed alternative prey. [...] It is cited as a significant predator of such commercially important species as Homarus gammarus (European lobster), Nephrops norvegicus (Norway lobster), and Cancer pagurus (edible crab) from traps. When preying on crabs, it immobilises the crab by injecting toxins into the body of the crab through a hole created in its shell using the octopus's radula. [...] The octopus then injects saliva into the crab and the digestive enzymes contained in that saliva break down the crab's internal attachments to it shell, allowing the octopus to easily remove the carapace.|$|E
40|$|This working {{document}} {{presents the results}} of the significant cephalopods in the Spanish Ground Fish Survey on the Porcupine bank (SPPGFS) from 2001 to 2011. The species more abundant in biomass terms in these surveys are <b>curled</b> <b>octopus</b> (Eledone cirrhosa), European flying squid (Todarodes sagittatus), seven-arm octopus (Haliphron atlanticus), Northern European squid (Loligo forbesi), globose octopus (Bathypolypus sponsalis), lesser flying squid (Todaropsis eblanae), broadtail shortfin squid (Illex coindetti) and stout bobtail squid (Rossia macrosoma). Biomass, distribution and length ranges were analysed. Most of the species occur in the shallower areas, except T. sagittatus, H. atlanticus and B. sponsalis that were mainly found in the deep strata...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve our {{knowledge}} on the feeding ecology of long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas) in Northeast Atlantic waters, skin samples of 68 long-finned pilot whales stranded in Northwest Iberia (n = 22) and Scotland (n= 46) were analysed using stable isotopes of δ 13 Candδ 15 N. Isotopic mixingmodels were applied to obtain a quantitative estimate of the proportion of themain prey species in the diet of pilot whales. Stable isotope analysis revealed that 57. 8 – 73. 8 % of the diet in Northwest Iberia consisted in <b>curled</b> <b>octopus</b> (Eledone cirrhosa), followed by European flying squid (Todarodes sagittatus), while in Scotland the predominant prey specieswas either Histioteuthis sp. or T. sagittatus, depending of the trophic enrichment factor applied. These results are generally in accordance with previous stomach content studies; however, the isotopic analysis may provide newinformation regarding key prey species and habitat use that could bemissed or underestimated if only stomach contents analysis were used. Additionally, considering that the Atlantic Coast of Iberia was responsible for 95 % of the landings of the main prey consumed by pilot whales in this area, between 2000 and 2010, these data provide trophic baseline information {{to be taken into}} account in fishery impact assessment studies andmanagement decisions...|$|E
40|$|Cadmium {{concentrations}} were {{measured in the}} flesh and hepatopancreas (digestive gland) of 1, 392 specimens of different species of cephalopod molluscs (broadtail squid, spider octopus, <b>curled</b> <b>octopus,</b> homed octopus, elegant cuttlefish, and pink cuttlefish) to determine whether maximum levels fixed by the European Commission were exceeded. In all species, mean cadmium {{concentrations were}} higher in hepatopancreas than in flesh. Large differences among the different species were also observed. Pink cuttlefish and spider octopus had the highest concentrations for both flesh (spider octopus, 0. 77 mug g(- 1); pink cuttlefish, 0. 87 mug g(- 1)) and hepatopancreas (spider octopus, 9. 65 mug g(- 1); pink cuttlefish, 18. 03 mug g(- 1)), and the lowest concentrations were encountered in broadtail squid (flesh, 0. 13 mug g(- 1); hepatopancreas, 2. 48 mug g(- 1)). The other species had intermediate concentrations of 0. 20 to 0. 30 mug g(- 1) in flesh and 5. 46 to 8. 01 mug g(- 1) in hepatopancreas. Concentrations exceeding the limit proposed by the European Commission (1. 00 mug g(- 1)) were observed in 44. 4 and 40. 0 % of flesh samples of spider octopus and pink cuttlefish, respectively. The estimated weekly intake, 0. 09 to 0. 66 mug/kg body weigh, was below the {{provisional tolerable weekly intake}} set by the World Health Organization...|$|E
40|$|Cadmium {{and mercury}} {{concentrations}} were {{measured in the}} flesh and hepatopancreas of different species of cephalopod molluscs (European squid, common octopus, <b>curled</b> <b>octopus,</b> horned octopus, pink cuttlefish, common cuttlefish) {{in order to establish}} whether the concentrations exceeded the maximum levels fixed by the European Commission. In hepatopancreas, the levels of cadmium were substantially higher than those in flesh (flesh 0. 11 - 0. 87 microg g(- 1) wet weight, hepatopancreas 2. 16 - 9. 39 microg g(- 1) wet weight), whilst the levels of mercury (flesh 0. 13 - 0. 55 microg g(- 1) wet weight, hepatopancreas 0. 23 - 0. 79 microg g(- 1)) were approximately double those in flesh. Concentrations exceeding the maximum permitted limit of cadmium were found in 39. 8 and 41. 0 % of common octopus and pink cuttlefish flesh, respectively. For mercury, concentrations above the limit were found only in octopuses, and precisely in 36. 8, 50. 0 and 20. 0 % of flesh samples of common, curled and horned octopus, respectively. In the hepatopancreas, concentrations of cadmium and mercury were above the proposed limits in all the samples examined. The estimated weekly intake of between 0. 09 and 0. 49 microg kg(- 1) body weight for cadmium and between 0. 05 and 0. 24 microg kg(- 1) body weight for mercury made only a small contribution to the provisional tolerable weekly intake (cadmium 1. 3 - 7. 0 %, mercury 1. 0 - 4. 8 %) set by the WHO.
