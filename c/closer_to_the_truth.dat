5|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} among historians that Bhimsen was not behind the poisoning. Bhimsen had nothing to gain by killing an infant less a year old, and the accusation was simply a ruse to answer foreign inquiries on Bhimsen's imprisonment. It was a general practice among the physicians of the time to check {{the strength of their}} medicine by first letting the mother taste it, before giving it to their new born. It was later rumored that it was the Junior Queen who had actually contrived to kill the Senior Queen by poisoning the medicine intended for her new born. While the poison did not express itself on the intended Queen, it managed to kill the infant prince, and the powerless Bhimsen was made a convenient scapegoat. Historian Gyanmani Nepal contends this to be <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Historian Tim Newark unraveled {{the myth}} {{in his book}} Mafia Allies. A version that is {{probably}} <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> is that Vizzini simply led a delegation of locals to meet an Allied patrol whose commander had asked to speak to whoever was in charge. He quotes local historian, Luigi Lumia, who described how a procession of people with Calogero Vizzini at the helm made its way towards the tanks chanting: 'Long Live America', 'Long Live the Mafia', 'Long Live Don Calo'. Vizzini {{was taken to a}} command post outside Villalba and was interrogated about a recent firefight involving an American jeep on patrol. When Vizzini {{made it clear that the}} Italian soldiers had fled and the firefight had been caused by exploding ammunition, the frustrated US army official took his rage out in a stream of obscenities. Vizzini was utterly embarrassed by the incident and ordered his interpreter not to tell anybody what had happened.|$|E

Meanwhile, George Amiroutzes was at this side, allegedly suborned by his cousin to betray David, advising his emperor that surrender would be the prudent course, and reminding him what happened to Constantinople because Constantine refused Mehmed's offer; perhaps Amiroutzes even showed David letters from Sara Khatun informing him that no help would be forthcoming from that quarter.|$|E

500|$|Until 1974, {{the scant}} {{information}} published concerning Enigma decryption attracted little attention.

[...] Still, this was marginally <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> than many British and American best-seller accounts that would follow after 1974.

500|$|By {{this point}} the Parliamentary right flank, under Philip Skippon, had begun assaulting the main Parliamentary {{objective}} – the nearby Round Hill. The official account suggests that the Parliamentarians [...] "charged so fiercely that [...] beat [...] from the hill"; Royalist accounts, on the other hand, argue that the hill was actually completely undefended. The official account fails to mention casualties to either attackers or defenders, or {{what happened to the}} Royalist guns which were allegedly deployed on the hill. [...] "Both sides' arguments have a ring of conviction but although Essex and his partisans seem to have been genuine in their belief that they had assaulted and captured a defended position, the facts suggest that the Royalist version was <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> In other words, the king and his generals had been caught napping".

[...] Military historian Norman Longmate observes tartly, [...] "in presenting damning facts in the most favourable light Charles [...] ministers were unsurpassed."

She then revived her musical career by recording the rock-inflected albums Cher (1987), Heart of Stone (1989), and Love Hurts (1991), all of which yielded several successful singles. She reached a new commercial peak in 1998 with the album Believe, whose title track became the biggest-selling single of all time by a female artist in the UK.

I've beat my body up so badly, it's amazing it's still talking to me and listening to what I say. But I’ve got aches and pains everywhere." [...] The soundtrack was also revealed, with eight songs performed by Aguilera, and two songs by Cher: [...] "Welcome to Burlesque" [...] and [...] "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me". During an interview with a California journal, Cher commented about [...] "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me", [...] "That song, for me, had a lot of meaning. It reminded me that I have to kind of move over." [...] She also spoke about the track with the Fresno Bee, saying [...] "Not that I'm doing it gracefully, because you'd have to pull me over kicking and screaming." [...] In the United States, the song was released to adult contemporary radio station on January 15, 2011 the first single from the soundtrack. In order to promote the song, several promotional remixes were made by Almighty, Dave Aude and StoneBridge. The remix EP, which contains uptempo dance versions of the track, was released onto iTunes Stores on November 24, 2010. The remix done by StoneBridge was released as a single on December 7, 2010.

500|$|Pinkner, Abrams, Orci, Burk, Kurtzman, Wyman, and Goldsman {{developed}} the second season's storyline together.

Though they changed certain aspects, they knew where Olivia and Peter were going to start and end up but [...] "got there at different paces than what [...] originally planned". While the first season both focused on Olivia and dealt with discovering the existence of an enemy, the second was designed to [...] " [...] to a very specific type of confrontation" [...] between the two universes. Explained Pinkner, [...] "Season 2 is about the people from 'over there' putting the final pieces of the invasion into play, and explaining why". At the same time, the producers approached the second season as a [...] "journey of self-actualization" [...] and [...] "maturation for our characters." [...] They wanted to make the three main cast members become more comfortable as a team in Fringe Division; Peter thus was written to be more heroic and to go from reluctance to a desire to help his father, while Walter became gradually more independent and [...] "grounded as a human being". They made the secret of Peter's origins one of the main story focuses of the season. While the audience had been made aware of Walter's secret in the season one finale, the producers wanted to [...] "acknowledge it to our characters". All the while Walter was [...] "suffering... and desperately trying to keep it all quiet", Olivia and Peter grew <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> By [...] "giv these things time" [...] to develop, Pinkner strove to avoid focusing just on [...] "event, event, event", instead concentrating on the real consequences of Peter and Olivia's eventual discovery.|$|E
