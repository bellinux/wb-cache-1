25|$|The first {{commercial}} gas well drilled in the US, in 1821 in Fredonia, New York, was a shale gas well producing from the Devonian Fredonia Shale formation.

25|$|In physics, a photon gas is a {{gas-like}} {{collection of}} photons, which has {{many of the}} same properties of a <b>conventional</b> <b>gas</b> like hydrogen or neon – including pressure, temperature, and entropy.

30|$|Spray {{pyrolysis}} technique {{competes with}} other techniques {{due to its}} low cost, suitable properties, and process well suited to large-scale production. In this work, nanostructured CuO thin films with different spraying time of the solution were prepared by spray pyrolysis technique. Crystal structure and grain sizes were studied from X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Elemental composition was carried out using energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). These nanostructured CuO thin films were tested for sensing different <b>conventional</b> <b>gases</b> and were observed to be most sensitive to H 2 S at 250 °C.|$|R

25|$|Forecasters now {{commonly}} {{suggest that}} western Canada's <b>conventional</b> <b>gas</b> production has peaked {{and will continue}} to decline. Gaps between traditional supply and growing demand are already being filled with gas from such diverse sources as tight sands; coalbed methane; and since January 2000, frontier gas and liquids from Nova Scotia's Sable Offshore Energy Project. Other likely future sources include Mackenzie Delta gas and liquefied natural gas from abroad. This suggests higher future costs and risks, and that suggests higher-priced future energy.|$|E
25|$|Making {{comparisons}} between wind {{and other sources}} of energy can be difficult {{because of the cost}} profiles associated with wind developments. The vast majority of the costs associated with wind developments are upfront capital costs. The operating costs are relatively low, with each additional unit of wind power costing very little to produce. By comparison, <b>conventional</b> <b>gas</b> and coal developments have large capital costs, as well as significant operating costs. The difference in cost profiles creates difficulties when trying to compare the cost of alternative energy sources.|$|E

50|$|Since {{it is in}} the gas phase, {{the amount}} of vapor present is {{quantified}} by the partial pressure of the gas. Also, vapors obey the barometric formula in a gravitational field, just as <b>conventional</b> atmospheric <b>gases</b> do.|$|R
25|$|Scramjet (supersonic {{combustion}} ramjet) engines {{present a}} much different situation for the combustor than <b>conventional</b> <b>gas</b> turbine engines (scramjets are not gas turbines, they generally have few or no moving parts). While scramjet combustors may be physically quite different from conventional combustors, they face {{many of the same}} design challenges, like fuel mixing and flame holding. However, as its name implies, a scramjet combustor must address these challenges in a supersonic flow environment. For example, for a scramjet flying at Mach 5, the air flow entering the combustor would nominally be Mach 2. One of the major challenges in a scramjet engine is preventing shock waves generated by combustor from traveling upstream into the inlet. If that were to happen, the engine may unstart, resulting in loss of thrust, amongst other problems. To prevent this, scramjet engines tend to have an isolator section (see image) immediately ahead of the combustion zone.|$|E

2500|$|New York has {{the largest}} hybrid bus fleet in the country, {{and some of the}} first hybrid taxis.

2500|$|The Fischer–Tropsch {{process has}} been applied in {{large-scale}} gas–liquids and coal–liquid facilities such as Shell's Pearl GTL facility in Ras Laffan, Qatar. Such large facilities are susceptible to high capital costs, high operation and maintenance costs, the uncertain and volatile price of crude oil, and the involvement of potentially environmentally damaging processes. In particular, the use of natural gas as a feedstock becomes practical only with use of [...] "stranded gas", i.e., sources of natural gas far from major cities which are impractical to exploit with <b>conventional</b> <b>gas</b> pipelines and LNG technology; otherwise, the direct sale of natural gas to consumers would become much more profitable. Several companies are developing the process to enable practical exploitation of so-called stranded gas reserves.|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{advances}} in analytical instruments enable direct measurement of natural abundance D/H ratios in organic molecules. The new instruments {{have the same}} framework as any <b>conventional</b> <b>gas</b> source IRMS, but incorporate new features such as larger magnetic sector, double focusing sectors, quadrupole mass filter and multi-collectors. Two commercial examples are the Nu Panorama and the Thermo Scientific 253 Ultra. These instruments generally have good sensitivity and precision. Using only tens of nanomoles of methane, the Ultra can achieve a stable high precision of around 0.1‰ error in δD. One of the first examples {{of this type of}} measurement has been the clumped isotopes of methane.(See section of [...] "natural gas" [...] in Fossil fuels) Another strength of this kind of instruments is the capability of doing site-specific isotopic ratio measurements. This technique is based on measuring D/H ratios of fragments from the ion source (e.g. CH3CH of propane molecule) that samples hydrogen atoms from different parts of the molecule.|$|E
