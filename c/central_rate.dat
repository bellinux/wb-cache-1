The koruna joined the ERM II on 28 November 2005 at the rate of € = 38.4550 Sk with a 15% band. On 17 March 2007, this rate was readjusted to 35.4424 Sk with the same band, an 8.5% increase in {{the value of}} the koruna. On the same day, 1 euro traded at 33.959 Sk.

2500|$|The initial {{experience}} of the EMS was disappointing. It had been expected that the Irish Pound would appreciate in value against Sterling, and hence reduce inflation in Ireland, but in practice Sterling appreciated considerably in value thanks to {{its status as a}} petrocurrency and to the tight monetary policies of the new British government of Margaret Thatcher. By late 1980 the Irish Pound had fallen in value to less than 80 British pence, and Irish inflation was higher than British.

This study uses Vector Auto Regression (VAR), which combined with the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) using the program Eviews 6. In the analysis methods Granger Causality Test, Impulse Response Function (IRF) and Variance Decomposition (VD) are used. The results showed that the Granger Causality Test found some significant relations between <b>central</b> bank <b>rates</b> that exist in the member countries of ASEAN + 3. The Impulse Response Function (IRF) shows the reaction of the <b>central</b> bank <b>rates</b> j shocks that occurred in <b>central</b> bank <b>rates</b> i.

Hungary's sovereign foreign currency debt issuance carries investment-grade ratings from all major credit-rating agencies, although recently the country was downgraded by Moody's, S&P and remains on negative outlook at Fitch. In 1995 Hungary's currency, the Forint (HUF), became convertible for all current account transactions, and subsequent to OECD membership in 1996, for almost all capital account transactions as well.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{conflict}} of real and monetary convergence during the EMU run-up of the Central and Eastern European member states. Using a Balassa-Samuelson model of productivity driven inflation, we find a high probability of higher inflation in the new member states. We compare the policy options which make the compliance possible, i. e. fiscal tightening and nominal appreciation within the ERM 2 band. Nominal appreciation within ERM 2 seems the better option to achieve the compliance with the Maastricht criteria, as no discretionary government intervention is necessary, and losses in terms of real growth are smaller. Having once opted for nominal appreciation by fixing the ERM 2 entry rate as the <b>central</b> <b>rate</b> (Irish model), {{a high degree of}} flexibility is provided in coping with erratic short-term capital inflows. The strategy of setting the ERM 2 entry rate above the <b>central</b> <b>rate</b> (Greek model) implies a clear exchange rate path within ERM 2 and thereby less exchange rate volatility. Despite the merits of nominal appreciation, countries committed to hard euro pegs, or with high budget deficits, may choose fiscal contraction as a solution.
