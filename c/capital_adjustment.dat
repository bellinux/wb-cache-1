When the steady state is stable then equilibrium is indeterminate and stable sunspots are possible. We find that <b>capital</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs of any size preclude stable sunspots for every empirically plausible specification of the model parameters. More specifically, we show that when <b>capital</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs of any size are considered, {{a necessary condition for}} the existence of stable sunspots is an upward- sloping labor demand curve in the capital-producing sector, which in turn requires an implausibly strong externality. This result contrasts sharply with the standard result that when we abstract from <b>capital</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs, stable sunspots occur in the two-sector model {{for a wide range of}} plausible parameter values. <b>capital</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs, determinacy, indeterminacy, sector-specific externality, sunspots...|$|E

In addition, we find that employment and <b>capital</b> <b>adjustments</b> reinforce each other, in that capital shortages reduce hiring and labour shortages reduce investment. Moreover, we find that the market oriented reforms introduced in Colombia after 1990 increased employment adjustments, especially on the job destruction margin, while reducing <b>capital</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Finally, we find that while completely eliminating frictions from factor adjustments would yield a dramatic increase in aggregate productivity through improved allocative efficiency, the reforms introduced in Colombia generated only modest improvements. adjustment costs; deregulation; input reallocation; irreversibilities; joint factor adjustment...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies <b>capital</b> <b>adjustment</b> at the {{establishment}} level. Our {{goal is to}} characterize <b>capital</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs, which are important for understanding both the dynamics of aggregate investment {{and the impact of}} various policies on capital accu- mulation. Our estimation strategy searches for parameters that minimize ex post errors in an Euler equation. This strategy is quite common in models for which adjustment occurs in each period. Here, we extend that logic to the estimation of parameters of dynamic optimization problems in which non-convexities lead to extended periods of investment inactivity. In doing so, we create a method to take into account censored observations stemming from intermittent investment. This methodology allows us to take the structural model directly to the data, avoiding time-consuming simulation- based methods. To study the effectiveness of this methodology, we first undertake several Monte Carlo exercises using data generated by the structural model. We then estimate <b>capital</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs for U. S. manufacturing establishments in two sectors. ...|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{economic}} history {{there have been}} episodes in which the liberalization of trade {{has been accompanied by}} a positive flow of migrants. Such phenomena are notable because they contradict the basic Heckscher-Ohlin conclusion that trade and labor mobility are substitutes. Also notable is the fact that migrants to the U. S. have been largely skilled rather than unskilled. This paper links these two phenomena by pointing out the simple fact that increased trade can involve different types of firm structures and different types of goods being traded, which in turn have different effects on skilled and unskilled labor. The interaction between different frictions that impact labor movements, specifically the interaction between <b>capital</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs and trade costs, has a significant effect on the gap between the returns to labor in the South and North. Although the decrease in trade costs and increase in trade dampens labor movements, the existence of asymmetric <b>capital</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs in the North and South increases it. To show these results formally, this paper calibrates and solves a two-country, two-sector model of trade and migration, in which countries differ in skill endowments and <b>capital</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs and sectors differ in structures and capital intensities. Empirical analysis is then provided, with results supporting the main qualitative implications of the model.

Thereafter, it is suggested that determinants of physical <b>capital</b> <b>adjustments</b> in agriculture can be divided into three main groups, namely drivers related to: i) expected (risk-adjusted) profit, ii) expected societal benefits and costs and iii) expected private nonpecuniary benefits and costs. The discussion that follows focuses on the determinants belonging to the first group and covers aspects related to product market conditions, technological conditions, financial conditions and the role of firm structure and organization. Furthermore, the role of subjective beliefs is emphasized.

40|$|Yearly {{revisions}} of Total Allowable Catch under EU policies {{for the management}} of North Sea fisheries come at high management costs and <b>capital</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs. It is unclear whether current EU fisheries policy strikes the right balance between the need to regularly adjust fish quota to new information on one hand, and the costs of gathering information and adjusting fisheries capital stock on the other hand. To analyze this question we present a model for a single-species fishery, where a profit maximizing decision-maker jointly determines optimal harvest and <b>capital</b> <b>adjustment</b> levels. Two alternative management systems are compared to the case of sole ownership without policy constraints: annual constrained quota adjustment and multiannual quota adjustment. In the case of unconstrained sole ownership the decision maker optimizes harvest and <b>capital</b> <b>adjustment</b> levels, while under annual constrained quota adjustment change in harvest is constrained by the harvest level of the previous year. Under multiannual quota adjustment <b>capital</b> <b>adjustment</b> is optimized on an annual basis while harvest is fixed for a longer period. We analyse quota adjustment in a stochastic setting, and compare results for the total discounted net benefits that include management costs and fishermen’s <b>capital</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs. For the purpose of illustration we apply the model to North Sea plaice. Results of annual constrained quota adjustment show that as the system becomes more rigid the optimal harvest policy changes less between different levels of previous harvest. Consequently, as harvest in the previous period increases fewer investments are required. Results of multiannual quota adjustment show that both optimal policies change very little as the frequency of harvest change decreases. The change in optimal policies, however, decreases together with decreasing frequency of harvest change...|$|E

40|$|Demographic change {{belongs to}} the mega-trends of the 20 th and the 21 st century. The ongoing aging process in major industrialized {{countries}} {{gives rise to the}} relative scarcity of raw labor and the relative abundance of physical capital. Standard macroeconomic models suggest that this depresses asset returns and increases wages which, in turn, provides incentives for more human capital accumulation. This thesis quantifies the macroeconomic effects of demographic change and reveals the importance of human <b>capital</b> <b>adjustments</b> for price and welfare effects within and across generations. Chapter 1 investigates the distributions of income, skills, and welfare in the German economy along the inter- and the intra-generational dimension. It shows that demographic change leads to a more capital- and skill-intensive economy and that high-school households loose compared to college households in terms of welfare. Chapter 2 disentangles the effect of demographic change on returns to risk-free and risky assets in the U. S. and measures the net effect on the equity premium. It shows that both returns decline while the equity premium increases slightly. Endogenous human <b>capital</b> <b>adjustments</b> are crucial for relatively small effects. Chapter 3 develops a method for computing transitional dynamics in heterogeneous agent models with aggregate risk if these transitions are induced by exogenous deterministic dynamics such as demographic change. The application of the method to a simple illustrative example shows a large reduction in total computing time while approximation errors are small...|$|R
