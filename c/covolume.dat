40|$|Let Σ be the Davis {{complex for}} a Coxeter system (W, S).

It follows that the set of <b>covolumes</b> of lattices in G is nondiscrete. We also show that the nonuniform lattice Γ is not finitely generated. Examples of Σ to which our results apply include buildings and non-buildings, and many complexes of dimension greater than 2. To prove these results, we introduce a new tool, that of “group actions on complexes of groups”, and use this to construct our lattices as fundamental groups of complexes of groups with universal cover Σ. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{construct}} and analyze a mixed finite volume method on quadrilateral grids for elliptic problems written {{as a system}} of two first order PDEs in the state variable (e. g., pressure) and its flux (e. g., Darcy velocity). An {{important point is that}} no staggered grids or <b>covolumes</b> are used to stabilize the system. Only a single primary grid system is adopted, and the degrees of freedom are imposed on the interfaces. The approximate flux is sought in the lowest-order Raviart–Thomas space and the pressure field in the rotated-Q 1 nonconforming space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the present finite volume method can be interpreted as a rotated-Q 1 nonconforming finite element method for the pressure with a simple local recovery of flux. Numerical results are presented for a variety of problems which confirm the usefulness and effectiveness of the method. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{initiate}} {{a study of}} the spectral theory of the locally symmetric space X=Γ G/K, where G=SO(3,Complex), Γ=SO(3,Z[i]), K=SO 3. We write down explicit equations defining a fundamental domain for the action of Γ on G/K. The fundamental domain is well-adapted for studying the theory of Γ-invariant functions on G/K. We write down equations defining a fundamental domain for the subgroup Γ_Z=(2, 1) _Z of Γ acting on the symmetric space G_R/K_R, where G_R is the split real form (2, 1) of G and K_R is its maximal compact subgroup (2).

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{important}} tasks of thermochemical codes for the calculation of detonation properties is the accurate description of the state of gaseous products within a rather wide range of pressures and temperatures – from several hundreds of kbar and several thousands of K to atmospheric pressure and temperature. Due to its simplicity and convenience, the Becker-Kistiakowski-Wilson (BKW) equation of state is used in many practical applications in the explosives field, despite its lack of rigorous theoretical background. The BKW EOS gives good agreement between calculated and experimentally obtained detonation parameters for many standard high explosives having densities in the range 1. 2 – 2 g/cm 3. However, it fails to predict accurately detonation properties at lower densities. To overcome this problem, we introduced the concept of density dependent molecular <b>covolumes</b> in the BKW EOS instead of invariant. The applicability of the approach is verified by comparing experimental and calculated values of detonation parameters for a series of explosives having different formulations and densities. It was found that by applying this approach the accuracy of the calculations for lower densities can be significantly improved...|$|R
