While the first and the second are military and economic alliances, the third aims to reach a supranational union of Russia and Belarus with a common government, flag, currency, etc.|$|E

Libya is rich in ancient Greek and Roman ruins. Recently there has been a growing trade in looted coins, statues and other artifacts found by Libyans who sell them to Egyptian middlemen for eventual sale to rich American and European collectors. In September 2008, a group of eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian guides on a desert safari in south Egypt were kidnapped and taken south to Sudan. From there, Sudanese officials say the hostages were taken to Libya. The Libyans said that after investigations they had determined the hostages were still in Sudan.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Due to <b>cross-border</b> <b>crimes</b> rise, the EU {{is working}} on the {{development}} of international judicial cooperation between Member States. Increase of illegal immigration, trafficking of drugs, weapons and human beings, and the advent of terrorism, made necessary a stronger judicial collaboration between States. Particular attention is paid on judicial collaboration between Western Balkans and the EU. CARDS program is a suitable evidence of it. Judicial cooperation includes mutual recognition of judicial decisions, cooperation in investigations, approximation of penal legislation of involved states, including the penalties. During the investigations, prior to an international request for warrant of arrest, an exchange of information on criminal offences and administrative infringements takes place between magistrates belonging to different countries.; this create new need for judicial cooperation environment supporting a cross-border judicial cooperation between EU and Countries of enlarging Europe. 1. Reference frame and objectives. An efficient cross-border judicial cooperation is a key success factor for fighting against the globalisation trend of criminal and terrorist organisations.

5000|$|Cyber crime, or {{computer}} related crime, is crime that involves {{a computer and}} a network. The computer {{may have been used}} in the commission of a crime, or it may be the target. Cybercrimes can be defined as: [...] "Offences that are committed against individuals or groups of individuals with a criminal motive to intentionally harm the reputation of the victim or cause physical or mental harm, or loss, to the victim directly or indirectly, using modern telecommunication networks such as Internet (networks including but not limited to Chat rooms, emails, notice boards and groups) and mobile phones (Bluetooth/SMS/MMS)". Cybercrime may threaten a person or a nation's security and financial health. Issues surrounding these types of crimes have become high-profile, particularly those surrounding hacking, copyright infringement, unwarranted mass-surveillance, child pornography, and child grooming. There are also problems of privacy when confidential information is intercepted or disclosed, lawfully or otherwise. Debarati Halder and K. Jaishankar further define cybercrime from the perspective of gender and defined 'cybercrime against women' as [...] "Crimes targeted against women with a motive to intentionally harm the victim psychologically and physically, using modern telecommunication networks such as internet and mobile phones".Internationally, both governmental and non-state actors engage in cybercrimes, including espionage, financial theft, and other <b>cross-border</b> <b>crimes.</b> Activity crossing international borders and involving the interests of at least one nation state is sometimes referred to as cyberwarfare.|$|R
40|$|The European Arrest Warrant (EAW) is a grossly coercive {{instrument}} {{that was designed}} for the persecution of serious <b>cross-border</b> <b>crimes.</b> In recent years, however, Member States have increasingly reported cases in which EAWs have not been issued for serious, but rather for harmless and minor offences.

Thereby, it claims that in current debates different categories of disproportionate use of EAWs are often lumped together, and only concentrate on {{the introduction of a}} (binding) proportionality test, failing to consider other alternative legislative solutions regarding minor crimes, such as the introduction of new comparable and effective alternative measures. These, however, are considered to be crucial for an alleviation of disproportionate warrants. La orden de detención europea (ODE) es un instrumento extremadamente coercitivo que fue diseñado para la persecución de delitos transfronterizos graves. En años recientes, sin embargo, los Estados miembro han notificado cada vez más casos en los que la ODE no se debía a delitos serios, sino a casos menores e inofensivos [...] En este artículo se analizan las razones que hay detrás del uso desproporcionado de la orden de detención europea y propone medidas para paliar el problema. De esta manera, se defiende que el debate actual, frecuentemente agrupan diferentes categorías de uso desproporcionado de la ODE, y sólo se concentran en la introducción de un test de proporcionalidad (vinculante), sin tener en cuenta otras soluciones legislativas alternativas, en lo que respecta a delitos menores, como la introducción de nuevas medidas alternativas, comparables y eficaces.
