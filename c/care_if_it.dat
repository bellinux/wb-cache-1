25|$|CPOE {{systems can}} take years to install and configure. Despite ample {{evidence}} of the potential to reduce medication errors, adoption of this technology by doctors and hospitals in the United States has been slowed by resistance to changes in physician's practice patterns, costs and training time involved, and concern with interoperability and compliance with future national standards. According {{to a study by}} RAND Health, the US healthcare system could save more than 81 billion dollars annually, reduce adverse medical events and improve the quality of <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were to widely adopt CPOE and other health information technology. As more hospitals become aware of the financial benefits of CPOE, and more physicians with a familiarity with computers enter practice, increased use of CPOE is predicted. Several high-profile failures of CPOE implementation have occurred, so a major effort must be focused on change management, including restructuring workflows, dealing with physicians' resistance to change, and creating a collaborative environment.|$|E

[...] The following year, the band released an EP titled 1.22.03.Acoustic (2004), which features [...] "Harder to Breathe" [...] in an acoustic version.

500|$|Even with statehood, {{there was}} still slavery in Indiana. [...] Despite slavery and indentures {{becoming}} illegal in 1816 due to the state constitution, the 1820 federal census listed 190 slaves in Indiana. [...] Many Hoosier slaveholders felt that the 1816 constitution did not cover preexisting slavery; others just did not <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was illegal. [...] In eastern Indiana nearly all slaveholders immediately freed their slaves. [...] But the majority of slaveholders in western counties, especially in Knox, decided to keep their slaves. [...] The Vincennes newspaper Western Sun had numerous times advertised [...] "indentured Negroes and other slaves", {{a sign of the}} approval of slavery in the area. [...] "In Knox County, virtually all of the (slave) suits were denied by the County Court in 1817 and 1818." [...] A black woman known as Polly was held slave by French trader Hyacinthe Lasselle of Vincennes. [...] Polly sued in 1820 for her freedom, but was denied in the Knox County Court. [...] She appealed to the Indiana Supreme Court, who ruled in her favor that she should be free. [...] But even after this decision, there was slavery in Indiana. [...] The federal census of 1830 still showed three slaves in Indiana: one each in Orange County, Decatur County, and Warrick County. A separate local census in Knox County in 1830 showed the presence of 32 slaves. [...] Even in 1840 there were three slaves listed in the federal census as being in Indiana: a girl in Putnam County and a man and girl in Rush County.|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{was also}} derided by {{opposing}} teams. Some, notably the St. Louis Cardinals, threatened to strike if Robinson played, {{but also to}} spread the walkout across the entire National League. Existence of the plot was leaked by the Cardinals' team physician, Robert Hyland, to a friend, the New York Herald Tribunes Rutherford [...] "Rud" [...] Rennie. The reporter, concerned about protecting Hyland's anonymity and job, in turn leaked it to his Tribune colleague and editor, Stanley Woodward, whose own subsequent reporting with other sources protected Hyland. The Woodward article made national headlines. After the threat was exposed, National League President Ford Frick and Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler {{let it be known}} that any striking players would be suspended. [...] "You will find that the friends that you think you have in the press box will not support you, that you will be outcasts," [...] threatened Chandler. [...] "I do not care if half the league strikes. Those who do it will encounter quick retribution. All will be suspended and I don't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> wrecks the National League for five years. This is the United States of America and one citizen has as much right to play as another." [...] Woodward's article received the E. P. Dutton Award in 1947 for Best Sports Reporting. New York Times columnist Red Smith turned to the Cardinals' 1947 racial strike in 1977, as a spate of commemorative articles appeared on the 30th anniversary of Robinson's signing with the Dodgers. Smith remembered his old Herald Tribune colleagues' part in exposing the players' strike conspiracy. It would have succeeded, wrote Smith, [...] "…if Rud Rennie and Stanley Woodward hadn't exposed their intentions in the New York Herald Tribune." ...|$|E
