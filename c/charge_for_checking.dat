40|$|Abstract. In {{respect of}} the {{frequent}} fraud cases of social insurance by government organizations, the inspection procedure usually relies on experts ’ experience for verification and experienced personnel in <b>charge</b> <b>for</b> <b>checking.</b> However, due to the heavy work load and the insufficiency of manpower and lack of experience, the ratio of miscarriages of justice is very high, leading to improper settlement of claims and the waste of social resources. In this paper, we employ rule technology to improve the above inefficiency. We employ a knowledge engineering methodology to analyze the problem and construct the knowledge model, including the domain schema and rules. We then implement the knowledge model along with the existing database applications. The benefits generated by the research are: (1) establishing a knowledge system with expertise reasoning to solve the review problems of massive cases, (2) significantly reducing the large labor cost and consumed time of the existing reviewing system, and (3) improving the application level of traditional database in the expert reasoning system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-For many years, ionic {{particle}} charging {{has been}} {{described in terms of}} field or diffusion charging because of their simplicity as models. Important advances in charging theories have come with publication of numerical models of the process. Still, numerical models exact a computational penalty that has led to investigations of approximations for them. In this paper, we present new analytical upper and lower <b>charging</b> bounds <b>for</b> continuum <b>charging,</b> useful <b>for</b> <b>checking</b> the accuracy of charging models. The best of the numerical models predicts charging within these bounds over much of its range, but exceeds the upper bound at moderate fields and long charging times. The standard models and the charging bounds exhibit a symmetry between positive and negative charges which may provide another test for numerical theories. We formulate an analytic charging rate model that remains within the bounds and gives good agreement with unipolar and bipolar charging data. The charging rate symmetry makes bipolar charging calculations quite simple. The adequacy of existing data <b>for</b> testing particle <b>charging</b> models is also discussed...|$|R

50|$|The {{regulator}} has {{sight of}} the claims made by policyholders and therefore can redistribute the funds it holds {{on the basis of}} relative claims made by policy holders. Thus insurers with high payouts receive more from the regulator than those with low payouts. Thus insurance companies have no incentive to deter high cost individuals from taking insurance and are compensated if they have to pay out more than a threshold. This threshold is set above the expected costs. Insurance companies compete with each other on price for the 45% direct premium part of the funding and should try to negotiate deals with hospitals to keep costs low and quality high. The competition regulator is <b>charged</b> with <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> abuse of dominant market positions and the creation of cartels that act against the consumer interests. An insurance regulator ensures that all basic policies have identical coverage rules so that no person is medically disadvantaged by his or her choice of insurer.|$|R
