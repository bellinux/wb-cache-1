5|$|At {{the same}} time, UBS {{announced}} the planned cut of 8,700 jobs and had implemented a new compensation plan. Under the plan, {{no more than}} one-third of any <b>cash</b> <b>bonus</b> would be paid out in the year it is earned with the rest to be held in reserve and stock-based incentives that would vest after three years; top executives would have to hold 75% of any vested shares. Additionally, the bank's chairman, Peter Kurer, would no longer receive any extra variable compensation, only a cash salary and a fixed allotment of shares that could not be sold for four years. In April 2009, UBS announced that it agreed to sell its Brazilian financial services business, UBS Pactual, for approximately US$2.5billion to BTG Investments. UBS rejected proposals to break apart the bank and divest its investment banking division.|$|E
5|$|Developmental stages began for {{the film}} midway through the series' first season {{production}} in January 1998. Co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone signed a deal with Comedy Central in April 1998 that contracted the duo to producing South Park episodes until 1999, gave them {{a slice of the}} lucrative spinoff merchandising the show generated within its first year, as well as an unspecified seven-figure <b>cash</b> <b>bonus</b> to bring the show to the big screen, in theaters. A large part of Parker and Stone's conditions attached to any potential movie project was that it must at least be R-rated, {{to keep in touch with}} the series' humor and its roots, the short The Spirit of Christmas. Parker stated that their desire was to approach the film from a much more creative perspective and do something other than a simple movie-length version of a regular episode. Despite alleged pressure from Paramount Pictures officials to keep the movie toned down, the two won the battle for a more mature rating.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis and {{treatment}} cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including {{the amount of}} diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms, and loans can be taken out. From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt {{to cover it up}} by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation, a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a <b>cash</b> <b>bonus,</b> a reputation increase, or both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the link between}} the incentive mechanisms embedded in CEO <b>cash</b> <b>bonuses</b> and the riskiness of banks. For a sample of U. S. and European banks, we employ the Merton distance to default model to show that increases in CEO <b>cash</b> <b>bonuses</b> lower the default risk of a bank. However, we find no evidence of <b>cash</b> <b>bonuses</b> exerting a risk-reducing effect when banks are financially distressed or when banks operate under weak bank regulatory regimes. Our results link bonus compensation in banking to financial stability and caution that attempts to regulate bonus pay need to tailor CEO incentives to the riskiness of banks and to regulatory regimes...|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} year Ross {{moved back to}} Montreal. He joined the Wanderers, the team he had helped to defeat, who played in the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA), the successor league to the CAHL as the premier league in the country. He scored eight goals in ten games over the two-month season that lasted from January to March. He helped the team to finish first in the ECAHA and retain the Cup in 1908 with challenges from Ottawa, Winnipeg and Toronto. The Wanderers were Cup champions throughout these challenges, so Ross became the second player to win the Cup with different teams in consecutive years, after Jack Marshall in 1901 and 1902. In January 1908, he participated in the first all-star game in sports history, {{a benefit for the}} family of former Wanderer defender Hod Stuart, who died the previous summer. Aside from his time with the Wanderers, Ross repeated his practice of playing for other teams who paid for his services in important matches. For the 1909 season Ross demanded a salary of $1,600. Although he settled for $1,200, the average salary of hockey players at the time was $600. Ross received a <b>cash</b> <b>bonus</b> of $400 to play in a Stanley Cup challenge against a team from Edmonton in December 1908, in which the Wanderers won the two-game, total-goal series 13–10. He finished the season with two goals in nine games.|$|E

Douglas, however—rejecting {{the distinction between}} a regular and emergency budget—resigned in 1934 and became {{an outspoken critic of}} the New Deal. Roosevelt strenuously opposed the Bonus Bill that would give World War I veterans a <b>cash</b> <b>bonus.</b> Congress finally passed it over his veto in 1936, and the Treasury distributed $1.5billion in cash as bonus welfare benefits to 4million veterans just before the 1936 election.|$|E
25|$|On 30 June 1932 Neville Chamberlain {{announced}} that the Government would exercise its right to call in the 5% War Loan, offering a choice of taking cash or continuing the loan at 3.5%. Although they were obliged to give 90 days' notice of such a change, a 1% tax-free <b>cash</b> <b>bonus</b> was offered to holders who acted by 31 July.

The number of answers on the board decreases from round to round, and as the game progresses, certain rounds are played for double or triple point value.

It {{also adds}} multiplayer content, including four online multiplayer maps and a cooperative mode metagame wherein players {{compete for a}} <b>cash</b> <b>bonus</b> during story missions by accumulating points from special kill bonuses and property damage. The pack's missions feature American pornographic actress Tera Patrick, who plays a whistleblower and former microbiologist for the Ultor Corporation. Originally slated for release on April 16, 2009, the pack was delayed a week to April 23 {{so it could be}} released alongside the demo for Volition-developed game Red Faction: Guerrilla. It was released on April 23, 2009. IGN praised the game's new co-op metagame but criticized its relatively short missions. Eurogamer gave a negative review and criticized its value proposition.|$|E
25|$|On September 22, 2003, Maxis {{released}} an expansion pack for SimCity 4 dubbed Rush Hour. The expansion pack enhances {{the range of}} transportation facilities available to the player, such as being able to build four lane avenues and elevated rail networks, as well as allowing them to trace traffic flow, while also allowing them to construct larger civic facilities; some such facilities have greater capacities, but all have increased maintenance costs. Additional features with the expansion also included {{the ability to control}} vehicles, take on missions that can unlock reward buildings much faster, affect their rating with the city and sometimes acquire a <b>cash</b> <b>bonus,</b> and introduced the ability to change between four architectural styles - three of these focus on architectural styles of American cities of differing eras, while the fourth introduces a new range of contemporary European-inspired architecture.|$|E

40|$|Performance-related {{incentive}} pay for teachers is being introduced in many countries, {{but there is}} little evidence of its effects. This paper evaluates a rank-order tournament among teachers of English, Hebrew, and mathematics in Israel. Teachers were rewarded with <b>cash</b> <b>bonuses</b> for improving their students' performance on high-school matriculation exams. Two identification strategies were used to estimate the program effects, a regression discontinuity design and propensity score matching. The regression discontinuity method exploits both a natural experiment stemming from measurement error in the assignment variable and a sharp discontinuity in the assignment-to-treatment variable. The results suggest that performance incentives {{have a significant effect on}} directly affected students with some minor spillover effects on untreated subjects. The improvements appear to derive from changes in teaching methods, after-school teaching, and increased responsiveness to students' needs. No evidence found for teachers' manipulation of test scores. The program appears to have been more cost-effective than school-group <b>cash</b> <b>bonuses</b> or extra instruction time and is as effective as <b>cash</b> <b>bonuses</b> for students. ...|$|R

25|$|Two days before, U-20 {{had sunk}} Earl of Lathom, but first allowed {{the crew to}} escape in boats. According to {{international}} maritime law, any military vessel stopping an unarmed civilian ship was required to allow those on board time to escape before sinking it. The conventions had been drawn up in a time before {{the invention of the}} submarine and took no account of the severe risk a small vessel, such as a submarine, faced if it gave up the advantage of a surprise attack. Schwieger could have allowed the crew and passengers of Lusitania to take to the boats, but he considered the danger of being rammed or fired upon by deck guns too great. Merchant ships had, in fact, been advised to steer directly at any U-boat that surfaced. A <b>cash</b> <b>bonus</b> had been offered for any that were sunk, though the advice was carefully worded so as not to amount to an order to ram. This feat would only be accomplished once during the war by a commercial vessel when in 1918 the White Star Liner RMS Olympic, sister ship to Titanic, rammed into SM U-103 in the English Channel, sinking the submarine.|$|E

500|$|The {{five million}} dollar prize {{was also the}} subject of {{criticism}} in that a driver inexperienced in driving IndyCars would have {{a higher risk of}} causing a crash, though Formula One driver Anthony Davidson downplayed the influence of the prize in causing the accident, stating that racing drivers by their nature try to win every race, whether they start from first or last. Many short track races in the United States offer a cash or points bonus where a driver who wins the pole and starts last can collect a <b>cash</b> <b>bonus</b> for winning; this was used at Lucas Oil Raceway at Indianapolis in the [...] "Night Before F1" [...] midget car race where the winner of the first feature race started last for the second in a reverse-grid race, and a driver who starts last by winning the first feature, starting last, and winning the second feature wins a <b>cash</b> <b>bonus.</b> Some series offer a point bonus for the driver who makes up the most positions in a race.|$|E
