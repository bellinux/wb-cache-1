5|$|Transformation, unlike {{transduction}} or conjugation, {{depends on}} numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process. In {{order for a}} bacterium to bind, take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state termed competence (see Natural <b>competence).</b> <b>In</b> Bacillus subtilis, about 40 genes are required {{for the development of}} competence. The length of DNA transferred during B. subtilis transformation can be between a third of a chromosome up to the whole chromosome. Transformation appears to be common among bacterial species, and thus far at least 60 species are known to have the natural ability to become competent for transformation. The development of <b>competence</b> <b>in</b> nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells.|$|E

The research {{is a presentation of}} qualitative-quantitative research, which aimed to analyze the concept of communicative <b>competences</b> <b>in</b> the curricula of kindergartens and based on direct observation to find out, how kindergarten teachers meet the communicative competences at this stage of education, how to diagnose them and what opportunities provides kindergarten environment to develop pre-school children communication competences. Based on the analysis of curriculum documents of selected kindergartens we found that schools include communicative <b>competences</b> <b>in</b> their conceptual materials and attach great importance to them, even if these documents have different content and formal level. From our observations and interviews with respondents, we concluded that kindergartens and their teachers usually provide good conditions for children to develop their communicative competences (positive communication climate, proper teacher speech pattern, primary prevention, [...] ...|$|R

Skilled users of AAC show communicative <b>competence</b> <b>in</b> four interrelated areas: linguistic, operational, social and strategic. Linguistic competence refers to language skills in the person's native language {{as well as the}} linguistic code of the symbol system selected. Operational competence involves the skills in the use and maintenance of the tool of communication, while social competence and strategic competence reflect knowledge and judgment in communicative interactions, including the compensations required for a slow speaking rate, communication breakdowns and those unfamiliar with AAC. An AAC user may require specific device programming and/or training to achieve competency in these areas.|$|E

The police announced in September 1973 that they were working on indictments towards Tjøntveit and two of the creditors who placed their representatives on the board after the company was insolvent. The police investigation was concluded in May 1975. By then, the statutes of limitations for the accounting issues had passed, and the police focused on the more serious charge of debt manipulation. Tjøntveit and two board members were indicted in 1976. The managing committee for the winding-up released its report in November 1977; the report concluded that although the company's books showed assets of NOK8.6 million, in reality it only had fifty Norwegian krone. The committee further criticized the company for having too low a share capital, lack of qualified management and insufficient <b>competence</b> <b>in</b> operation and management of large aircraft.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose and {{validation}} a program for development of methodological <b>competences</b> <b>in</b> beginning teachers. In order to undertake the research there were established next objectives: elaborating, validating and pre-testing the instruments for experimental model; the final evaluation of methodological competences; establishing the formative activities for competences development and the final evaluation of methodological <b>competences.</b> <b>In</b> our research there are utilized the psycho-pedagogical experiment and statistical methods. The statistical data of experimental research indicate significant differences between the results obtained by beginning teachers at the evaluation tests of final stage, compared with those obtained in the initial stage.
