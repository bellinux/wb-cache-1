5|$|At the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, the Combined Chiefs of Staff {{agreed to}} {{establish}} a staff to plan operations in north west Europe in 1944. It was envisaged that the Supreme Allied Commander would be British, and the usual practice was for the commander and the <b>chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> <b>to</b> be of the same nationality, so {{it was decided to}} appoint a British officer for the role of <b>chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> <b>to</b> the Supreme Allied Commander (Designate) (COSSAC), with an American deputy. In March 1943 Morgan became COSSAC. Brigadier General Ray Barker became his American deputy. Initially, Morgan's staff consisted of an aide, two batmen and a driver with a car purloined from I Corps headquarters. Morgan established his headquarters in Norfolk House at 31 St James's Square. However, by October 1943, it was clearly too small for COSSAC needs, which called for accommodation for a staff of 320 officers and 600 other ranks. In November and December part of the staff moved to the South Rotunda, a bombproof structure that had originally been fitted up as an anti-invasion base, which was connected to the various ministries by the Whitehall Tunnel.
