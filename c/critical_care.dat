5|$|Intravenous {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for procedural sedation (often {{in combination with}} an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation {{of people who are}} ventilated in <b>critical</b> <b>care</b> units. Midazolam is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but propofol has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action, and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used in the ICU for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.|$|E

5|$|Recommended {{treatment}} for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria, parenteral artesunate {{was superior to}} quinine in both children and adults. In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine {{in the treatment of}} cerebral malaria in children. Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a <b>critical</b> <b>care</b> unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium.|$|E

5|$|For centuries, {{tracheotomy}} {{was considered}} the only reliable method for intubation of the trachea. However, because {{only a minority of}} patients survived the operation, physicians undertook tracheotomy only as a last resort, on patients who were nearly dead. It was not until the late 19th century however that advances in understanding of anatomy and physiology, as well an appreciation of the germ theory of disease, had improved the outcome of this operation {{to the point that it}} could be considered an acceptable treatment option. Also at that time, advances in endoscopic instrumentation had improved to such a degree that direct laryngoscopy had become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. By the mid-20th century, the tracheotomy as well as endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation had evolved from rarely employed procedures to becoming essential components of the practices of anesthesiology, <b>critical</b> <b>care</b> medicine, emergency medicine, and laryngology.|$|E

Critical theory and <b>critical</b> <b>caring</b> theory informed the qualitative research design and analysis, with attention to broad social, historical, political, and economic influences on food insecurity. Findings describe the great lengths participants went to make ends meet. These findings are framed using the social determinants of health.

40|$|The {{transition}} from student nurse to professional nurse {{is often difficult}} for the new graduate especially if transitioning into <b>critical</b> or progressive <b>care</b> areas of practice. It is imperative for new graduates to receive a clinical orientation that meets their educational and transitional needs. The orientation process should {{provide them with a}} strong foundation in <b>critical</b> or progressive <b>care</b> practices. Educators are challenged to provide educational opportunities while accommodating diverse learning needs and continuing to maintain competency that ensures the highest quality of patient care and improved patient care outcomes. New graduate nurses hired into the <b>critical</b> or progressive <b>care</b> areas were asked to participate in a study evaluating the effect of blended orientation approaches on their level of self-confidence and satisfaction with current orientation methods. Their level of self-confidence and satisfaction were evaluated and measured using a pretest and posttest questionnaire. New graduates entering <b>critical</b> or progressive <b>care</b> areas of practice were evaluated following nursing school (prior to hospital orientation) and following a two month hospital orientation model. The results did not reveal any significant difference between pre and post orientation.
