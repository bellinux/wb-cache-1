Marine mammals have developed a number of features for efficient locomotion such as torpedo shaped bodies to reduce drag; modified limbs for propulsion and steering; tail flukes and dorsal fins for propulsion and balance. Marine mammals are adept at thermoregulation using dense fur or blubber, circulatory adjustments (<b>counter-current</b> heat exchangers); torpedo shaped bodies, reduced appendages, and large size to prevent heat loss.|$|E

40|$|The supper ocean {{heat content}} and {{seasonal}} sea level {{changes in the}} eastern Tropical Atlantic do not depend only upon the vertical displacements of the shallow tropical thermocline {{and changes in the}} temperature and thickness of the tropical surface waters. These seasonal changes also depend heavily upon the changes in thickness of the South Atlantic central waters, advected to the east into the Gulf of Guinea by the three equatorial <b>counter-currents,</b> and polewards from the Equator along the African shelf edge by the coastal <b>counter-currents.</b> The heat content of the tropical surface waters and the South Atlantic central waters are compared: heat gain and loss between these two water masses seem to be in balance...|$|R
25|$|The carotid rete is a <b>counter-current</b> heat exchanging organ in some ungulates. The blood {{ascending}} the carotid arteries {{on its way}} to the brain, flows via {{a network}} of vessels where heat is discharged to the veins of cooler blood descending from the nasal passages. The carotid rete allows Thomson's gazelle to maintain its brain almost 3°C (5.4°F) cooler than the rest of the body, and therefore aids in tolerating bursts in metabolic heat production such as associated with outrunning cheetahs (during which the body temperature exceeds the maximum temperature at which the brain could function).|$|E
25|$|Their extremist {{position}} was conspicuous {{enough that the}} more centrist Moldovan felt obliged {{to distance himself from}} both his disciples. By 1935, Herseni had also come to sympathize with a fascist dissidence which divided the Gustian movement: although attacked by Ernest Bernea in Rânduiala magazine, which spoke for this <b>counter-current,</b> he parted ways with Stahl over political stances. At the time, moderate left-wingers such as Stahl and Golopenția, witnessing the internecine conflicts between the Guardist supporters and the radical-left group headed by Gheorghe Vlădescu-Răcoasa, began equating Herseni's politics with an egotistic social climbing. Herseni's Iron Guard affiliation also ruined his relationship with Gusti: he abandoned his editorial office at the ISR's magazine, Sociologie Românească, to be replaced by Golopenția, who was now Gusti's most treasured companion.|$|E
25|$|Hot {{water from}} the {{treatment}} plant was circulated in small-bore pipes alongside the pipeline to reduce heat losses and potential hydrate formation, an ice-like substance that can cause blockages. At the Pickering treatment plant raw gas was routed through a slug catcher and inlet separator to remove liquid hydrocarbons and water. Gas flowed to two parallel vetrocoke absorbers where it was washed with a <b>counter-current</b> aqueous solution of soda ash and arsenic compounds to convert the hydrogen sulphide to elemental sulphur. Gas then flowed to a hydrocarbon recovery unit where it was chilled to remove further liquid hydrocarbons, the dry sulphur-free gas passed through a British Gas metering station to Feeder No. 6 of the National Transmission System which passes through Pickering. The sulphur-rich solution from the absorbers was routed to oxidiser regenerators where air was bubbled through the solution to remove the sulphur {{in the form of}} a froth. The froth was dried in a rotary vacuum filter and heated in an autoclave to allow removal of impurities prior to being stored in tanks at about 130°C from where it was removed by heated road tanker. The regenerated absorber solution from the oxidisers, together with recovered solution from the vacuum filters, was returned for reuse in the vetrocoke absorbers. Hydrocarbon liquids were routed to condensate stabilizers and then to storage tanks for removal by road tanker.|$|E

2500|$|Similar to the <b>counter-current</b> type, but the {{gasification}} agent gas {{flows in}} co-current configuration with the fuel (downwards, {{hence the name}} [...] "down draft gasifier"). Heat needs {{to be added to}} the upper part of the bed, either by combusting small amounts of the fuel or from external heat sources. The produced gas leaves the gasifier at a high temperature, and most of this heat is often transferred to the gasification agent added in the top of the bed, resulting in an energy efficiency on level with the <b>counter-current</b> type. Since all tars must pass through a hot bed of char in this configuration, tar levels are much lower than the <b>counter-current</b> type.|$|E

2500|$|Air {{is pumped}} through the CO2 {{absorber}} {{as the first}} step of this process. [...] CO2 absorber for DAC are designed either as a <b>counter-current</b> spray tower or as a <b>counter-current</b> thin-falling-film contractor to maximize the contact area between the air and the solvent and thus maximize the absorption driving force. [...] The solvent is regenerated in the causticization unit by reacting the Na2CO3 with Ca(OH)2, which also transfers the captured CO2 to the form of CaCO3 solid crystals. [...] A mechanical filter is then used to separate the CaCO3 crystals form the water. [...] Since the crystals come out wet from the filter, they are dried in a steam dryer. [...] Then the dry crystals are heated in a furnace to produce CaO and pure CO2 gas. [...] The CaO is then hydrated to regenerate the Ca(OH)2 used for the causticization reaction. [...] The pure CO2 stream is then compressed and ready to be transported for geologic sequestration, EOR, or other commercial applications.|$|E

2500|$|EDTA {{was used}} in {{separation}} of the lanthanide metals by ion-exchange chromatography. [...] Perfected by F.H. Spedding et al. in 1954, the method relies on the steady increase in stability constant of the lanthanide EDTA complexes with atomic number. Using sulfonated polystyrene beads and copper(II) as a retaining ion, EDTA causes the lanthanides to migrate down the column of resin while separating into bands of pure lanthanide. The lanthanides elute in order of decreasing atomic number. Due to the expense of this method, relative to <b>counter-current</b> solvent extraction, ion-exchange is now used only to obtain the highest purities of lanthanide (typically greater than 4N, 99.99%).|$|E
2500|$|Until {{the sixth}} century, the Greek term theoria, meaning [...] "contemplation" [...] in Latin, {{was used for}} the mystical {{interpretation}} of the Bible. The link between mysticism and the vision of the Divine was introduced by the early Church Fathers, who used the term as an adjective, as in mystical theology and mystical contemplation. Under the influence of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite the mystical theology came to denote the investigation of the allegorical truth of the Bible, and [...] "the spiritual awareness of the ineffable Absolute beyond the theology of divine names." [...] Pseudo-Dionysius' Apophatic theology, or [...] "negative theology", exerted a great influence on medieval monastic religiosity.

2500|$|A {{fixed bed}} of {{carbonaceous}} fuel (e.g. coal or biomass) {{through which the}} [...] "gasification agent" [...] (steam, oxygen and/or air) flows in <b>counter-current</b> configuration. The ash is either removed in the dry condition or as a slag. The slagging gasifiers have a lower ratio of steam to carbon, achieving temperatures higher than the ash fusion temperature. The nature of the gasifier means that the fuel must have high mechanical strength and must ideally be non-caking {{so that it will}} form a permeable bed, although recent developments have reduced these restrictions to some extent. The throughput for this type of gasifier is relatively low. Thermal efficiency is high as the temperatures in the gas exit are relatively low. However, this means that tar and methane production is significant at typical operation temperatures, so product gas must be extensively cleaned before use. The tar can be recycled to the reactor.|$|E

2500|$|The {{characteristic}} long tail of most rodents is {{a feature}} that has been extensively studied in various rat species models, which subsequently suggest three primary functions of this structure: thermoregulation, minor proprioception, and a nocifensive-mediated degloving response. Rodent tails, particularly in rat models, has been implicated with a thermoregulation function that follows from its anatomical construction. This particular tail morphology is evident across the Muridae family (in contrast to the bushier tails of the Squirrel/Sciuridae family). The tail is hairless and thin-skinned, but highly vascularized, thus allowing for efficient <b>counter-current</b> heat exchange with the environment. The high muscular and connective tissue densities of the tail, along with ample muscle attachment sites along its plentiful caudal vertebrae facilitate specific proprioceptive senses to help orient the rodent in a three dimensional environment. Lastly, murids have evolved a unique defense mechanism termed [...] "degloving" [...] which allows for escape from predation through {{the loss of the}} outermost integument layer on the tail. However, this mechanism is associated with multiple pathologies that {{have been the subject of}} investigation.|$|E
