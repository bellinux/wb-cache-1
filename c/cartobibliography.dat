40|$|Esse artigo aborda o contexto de produção das várias edições do mapa de John Mitchell, intitulado Map of the British and French Dominions in North América, primeiramente publicado em 1755. A partir desse exemplo, discute a concepção, já arraigada na História da Cartografia, de que os mapas devem ser entendidos a partir da área que eles cartografam. Propõe, então, que os mapas devem ser entendidos observando as demandas do público e as formas de consumo dos mesmos. This article {{analyses}} the John Mitchell's eight-sheet, Map of the British and French Dominions in North America, {{first published}} in 1755. This map poses a significant challenge to the traditional approaches to the History of Cartography in which maps are studied according to the regions they depict rather than the contexts within which they were made and used. In particular, we must organize our historical narratives and <b>cartobibliographies</b> around not the regions and places mapped, but rather the contexts within which maps were made and used...|$|R

40|$|With their {{detail of}} past {{geographical}} distributions, early maps can be valuable documents in assisting many fields of local study. Much of Scotland's distinctive cartography was channelled into the brief {{period between the}} publication of the Blaeu atlas in 1654 and the Ordnance Survey six- and twenty-five inch sheets which first appeared in the 1840 s and 1850 s. Despite a scarcity of maps, particularly prior to the mid-eighteenth century, Scotland has a uniquely rich cartographic history and the work of early map-makers has contributed to placing "Scotland among the best mapped countries in the world". Unfortunately, this archive of Scotland's past remains largely untapped and study of the maps themselves has been noticeably limited, particularly in the field of <b>cartobibliography</b> (or listing what exists), where few areas have been investigated in detail. This work attempts to fill the gap for Renfrewshire and its burghs of Paisley, Greenock and Port Glasgow. The selected maps are mostly topographical, illustrating the county either as a separate unit or as a major part of a larger area. Maps which cover the whole of Scotland are not discussed, thereby excluding the one-inch Ordnance Survey sheets. Also omitted are large scale plans of estates or significant portions of the county. As the intention is to be as comprehensive as possible, both printed and manuscript maps are listed. Relatively few thematic maps were published before {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century but those relating solely to the county are again discussed...|$|E
40|$|Published maps of Alaska {{provide a}} rich but underutilized {{historical}} resource. There have [...] been several major bibliographies {{done in the}} past. Two of these are still in use today: [...] Wagner's Cartography o f the Northwest Coast of America published in 1937 and Phillips' Alaska [...] and the Northwest Part of North America, 1588 - 1898, published in 1898. A third major resource [...] is A. V. Efimov's Atlas o f Geographical Discoveries in Siberia and North-western America, [...] XVII-XV 111 Centuries, published in 1964. [...] The Efimov Atlas is a masterfully annotated compilation of early maps, primarily from [...] Soviet archives. It covers 194 key maps. The Wagner <b>cartobibliography</b> is concerned more [...] with California and the Pacific Northwest than it is with Alaska. His coverage ends in 1800, [...] well before the full development of official Russian cartography of Alaska. The oldest of the [...] bibliographies still in use is that of Phillip Lee Phillips. It is essentially a list of materials [...] available in the Library of Congress and does not take account of other repositories. It also [...] {{does not reflect the}} m any additions of early maps made to the Library of Congress in more [...] recent years. [...] A number of perimeters were adopted in deciding on how to handle this mass of [...] information. The <b>cartobibliography</b> only lists published maps. This includes manuscript [...] maps that were subsequently published in facsimile. Unpublished maps require an entirely [...] different research strategy and a separate system of annotations. In addition, a work that [...] included unpublished maps would be a very large undertaking, requiring a number of [...] years of additional work to bring to fruition. Another major decision was to provide a guide [...] to the location of map images, not an exhaustive bibliographic description of each map. I [...] believe that the rigorous examination of states of a copper engraving plate, say, would [...] prove of great value for some sub-sets in this bibliography, but it would not be feasible for [...] the entire work. In addition, some of this work has already been done for some of the [...] older maps. [...] Citations consist of the following elements: (1) an identifying number, consisting of the [...] year of publication followed by a number within that year; (2) the map title and map maker, [...] (3) the place and date of publication; (4) the size of the map; (5) where the map appeared, if [...] {{it is part of a}} book or atlas; (6) a reference to one of the major authorities cited here; (7) a [...] citation to where the map has been reproduced; and (8) comments on the map. [...] Since the guiding principle is access to at least a copy of the map, the most commonly [...] available reproductions are chosen for citation here. In many cases, one of the cited authorities, [...] such as Wagner, will include additional locations. Many of these reproductions [...] are almost as difficult to obtain today as the original map itself. [...] Wagner's bibliography cites 862 maps. His primary interest was California. I have found [...] that 211 of his citations are of Alaska interest. For the period covered by Wagner, I have [...] found 350 maps that he does not list. For this same period, Phillips has only 127 maps [...] dealing with Alaska and they are basically covered by Wagner. [...] Phillips included maps of all of the Northwest Coast and its various parts. There are [...] many maps (those, for example, that refer to Oregon) that are not of interest here. For [...] 1810 - 1900, he lists 353 Alaskan maps. This bibliography cites an additional 596 maps for [...] this period that are not to be found in Phillips. [...] I have included a short selective bibliography on maps of Alaska. It does not attempt [...] coverage of the extensive number of voyage reports or general literature of exploration. The [...] best general coverage of this subject despite some omissions and occasional inaccuracies [...] remains James Wickersham's A Bibliography of Alaska Literature, 1724 - 1924...|$|E
