Its therapeutic usage is mainly {{associated with the}} adaptogenic properties of this species. Roseroot is characterized by high morphological, phytochemical, and genetic differentiation. The aim of the present work {{was to determine the}} biometric and phytochemical co-variability of this taxon. Samples of Rh. rosea were collected from 4 -year-old experimental field cultivation established by rhizome division in western Poland. For each plant, the biometric measurements of the <b>clumps,</b> <b>shoots,</b> leaves, and rhizomes with roots were carried out. In the underground plant parts (raw material), the contents of the main active compounds (phenylpropanoids, phenylethanoids, phenolic acids, and catechins) were determined by the HPLC-DAD method. K-means clustering analysis showed three well-separated plant groups of Rh. rosea that differed significantly in the level of most of the investigated components. It was interesting that in the raw material with a high content of phenylethanoids, a low level of phenyl­propanoids was found, and vice versa. These chemical groups clearly differed in luxuriance of plants, too. The important diagnostic feature was also the degree of leaf serration. The morphological and phytochemical co-variability of roseroot was confirmed by the correlations detected between some active compounds (especially catechins and rosavin) and biometric traits describing the size and serration of leaves, the size of <b>clumps</b> and <b>shoots</b> as well as the weight of the raw material...|$|R

40|$|Summary We used three {{methods to}} measure {{boundary}} layer conductance to heat transfer (gbH) and water vapor transfer (gbV) in foliated branches of Abies amabilis Dougl. ex J. Forbes, a subalpine forest tree that produces <b>clumped</b> <b>shoot</b> morphol-ogy on sun-formed branches. Boundary layer conductances estimated {{in the field}} from energy balance measurements in-creased linearly from approximately 10 mm s− 1 at low wind speeds (< 0. 1 m s− 1) to over 150 mm s− 1 at wind speeds of 2. 0 m s− 1. Boundary layer conductances measured on shoot models in a wind tunnel were consistently higher than field measurements. The difference between wind tunnel values and field measurements was attributable to variation in path length between the two experimental environments. Boundary layer conductance estimated by subtracting stomatal resistance (rsV) measured with a porometer from the total branch vapor phase resistance were unusually small. Sensitivity analysis demon-strated that this method is not suitable for coniferous foliage or when stomatal conductance (gsV) is small compared with gbV. Analysis of the relative magnitudes of gsV and gbV revealed that, under most conditions, A. amabilis branches are well coupled (i. e., gsV is the dominant controller of transpiration). The boundary layer conductance to heat transfer is small enough that leaf temperature can become substantially higher than air temperature when radiation is high and wind speed is low. Over a two-month period, the maximum difference between leaf and air temperatures exceeded 6 °C. Leaf temperature exceeded air temperature by more than 2 °C on 10 % of the daylight hours during this period. Consideration of both the photosynthetic temperature response of A. amabilis foliage {{as well as the}} summer air temperature conditions in its habitat suggests that these elevated leaf temperatures do not {{have a significant impact on}} carbon gain during the growing season...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} {{question}} of whether the spatial distribution of root biomass mirrors the highly <b>clumped</b> distribution of <b>shoot</b> biomass in two desert plant communities (short and medium strandveld) on the west coast of South Africa. Results indicate that this is generally not the case. In both communities, there was no significant difference between the fine root (< 2 mm diameter) biomass under clumps compared with gaps between clumps. In the short strandveld, this was also the case for structural root mass. The only exception to this general trend was in the case of structural roots in the medium strandveld where there was more biomass under vegetation clumps. These patterns suggest that strandveld plants are shaped by the trade off between advantages of clumping and the inevitable competition for water that this association brings. In these communities, the competitive disadvantages of clumping above-ground may be offset by root foraging between clumps. Fertile islands do not seem to be a feature of these communities.

The estimation of biochemical constituents of leaves from remotely sensed data is of high interest revealing insight on photosynthetic processes, plant health, plant functional types, and species composition. However, upscaling leaf level observations to canopy level is not a trivial task, in particular due to the inherent structural complexity of forests. A common solution for scaling spectral information {{is the use of}} physically-based radiative transfer models. We parameterize the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model based on airborne and in situ measurements. At-sensor radiances were simulated and compared with measurements of the Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) imaging spectrometer. The study was performed on the Laegern site (47 ° 28 " 43. 0 N, 8 ° 21 " 53. 2 E, Switzerland), a temperate mixed forest characterized by steep slopes, a heterogeneous spectral background, and a high species diversity. Particularly the accurate 3 D modeling of the complex canopy architecture is crucial to understand the interaction of photons with the vegetation canopy and its background. Two turbid medium based forest reconstruction approaches were developed and compared; namely based on a voxel grid and based on individual tree detection. Our study shows that the voxel grid based reconstruction yields better results. When using a pixel-wise comparison with the imaging spectrometer data, the voxel grid approach performed better (R² = 0. 48, 780 nm) than the individual tree approach (R² = 0. 34, 780 nm). Spatial patterns as compared to APEX data were similar, whereas absolute radiance values differed slightly, depending on wavelength. We provide a successful representation of a 3 D radiative regime of a temperate mixed forest, suitable to simulate most spectral and spatial features of imaging spectrometer data. Limitations of the approach include the high spectral variability of leaf optical properties between and within species, which will be further addressed.

40|$|Abstract. Leaf area index (LAI) {{is a key}} {{structural}} {{characteristic of}} forest ecosystems because {{of the role of}} green leaves in controlling many biological and physical processes in plant canopies. Accurate LA 1 estimates are required in studies of ecophysiology, atmosphere-ecosystem interactions, and global change. The objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate LA 1 values obtained by several research teams using different methods for a broad spectrum of boreal forest types in support of the international Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). These methods include destructive sampling and optical instruments: the tracing radiation and architecture of canopies (TRAC), the LAI- 2000 plant canopy analyzer, hemispherical photography, and the Sunfleck Ceptometer. The latter three calculate LA 1 from measured radiation transmittance (gap fraction) using inversion models that assume a random spatial distribution of leaves. It is shown that these instruments underestimate LA 1 of boreal forest stands where the foliage is clumped. The TRAC quantifies the clumping effect by measuring the canopy gap size distribution. For deciduous stands the clumping index measured from TRAC includes the clumping effect at all scales, but for conifer stands it only resolves the clumping effect at scales larger than the shoot (the basic collection of needles). To determine foliage <b>clumping</b> within conifer <b>shoots,</b> a video camera and rotational light table system was used. The major difficulties in determining the surface area of small conifer needles have been largely overcome by the use of an accurate volume displacement method. Hemispherical photography has the advantage that it also provides a permanent image record of the canopies. Typically, LA 1 falls in the range from 1 to 4 for jack pine and aspen forests and from 1 to 6 for black spruce. Our comparative studies provide the most comprehensive set of LA 1 estimates available for boreal forests and demonstrate that optical techniques, combined with limited direct foliage sampling, can be used to obtain quick and accurate LA 1 measurements. 1...|$|R
40|$|Coniferous {{forests are}} {{important}} in the regulation of the Earth’s climate and thus continuous monitoring of these ecosystems is crucial to better understand potential responses to climate change. Optical remote sensing (RS) provides powerful methods for the estimation of essential climate variables and for global forest monitoring. However, coniferous forests represent challenging targets for RS methods, mainly due to structural features specific for coniferous trees (e. g. narrow needle leaves, <b>shoot</b> <b>clumping)</b> whose effects on the RS signal are not yet known or not yet fully understood. Recognizing {{the need for a}} better adaptation of RS methods to such spatially heterogeneous and structurally complex canopies, this thesis contributes to improving the interpretation of the remotely sensed optical signal reflected from coniferous stands by focusing on specific knowledge gaps identified in the RS methods at different scales of the coniferous canopies. In addition, it explores the application of approaches that simplify the way the structural complexity of such an environment is tackled when using canopy-level radiative transfer approaches. Three main levels based on the identified gaps were defined for the analysis: (needle) leaf level (chapter 2 and 3); shoot level (chapter 4) and canopy level (chapter 5). At leaf levelthis thesis contributes to minimizing the uncertainties and errors related to leaf optical measuring methods adapted for needle leaves. Although optical properties of coniferous leaves are extensively used in RS approaches (i. e. as input or as validation data), there is {{only a limited number of}} techniques available for measuring coniferous leaves. The first focus of this thesis was to review the shortcomings and uncertainties of such methods in order to identify application limits and potential improvements (chapter 2). A review showed that a more standardized measuring protocol was needed, for which measurement uncertainties and errors had to be identified, quantified and preferably removed or minimized. Thus, an experimental set-up improving the original method of Mesarch et al. (1999) was presented (chapter 3), which focused on analyzing uncertainties caused by the presence of the sample holder and by the multiple scattering triggered by both the shape of the specific needle cross-section, and the distance between the needles composing a sample. Results showed that both the sample holder and the multiple scattering, triggered specially by the shape of the non-flat cross section of the coniferous needle-leaves, had a non-negligible effect on the optical signal when measured using a standard spectroradiometer coupled to a single-beam integrating sphere and following the method suggested by Mesarch. Thus, approaches designed to measure optical properties of non-flat coniferous needle samples more comprehensively should take into account these effects in their current signal correction algorithms. Needle <b>clumping</b> into <b>shoots</b> quickly transforms the optical signal making the description of the canopy radiative transfer a complex task and encouraging the search for simplified yet robust approaches. Thus, subsequent steps in this thesis focus on one such simplified approach, known as the recollision probability theory (“p-theory”), applied at two hierarchical levels, i. e., shoots (Chapter 4) and the whole canopy (Chapter 5). At shoot level, an empirical verification of the relationship between the photon recollision probability and a structural parameter called STAR was investigated. The approach allows upscaling needle albedo to shoot albedo and was previously theoretically tested only (chapter 4). For this analysis empirical optical measurements of Scots pine needles and shoots were used. Results showed that the approach works well for the VIS and SWIR spectral regions. However, it was less accurate for the NIR and also for sparse shoots (STAR < 0. 15) with an uneven distribution of photon–needle interactions and a larger influence of the twig bark. Finally, accurate modelling of the reflectance signal at canopy levelfor coniferous canopies requires realistic representations of the forest stands, which in general implies a large number of input parameters and computationally demanding algorithms. Radiative transfer modelling based on the photon recollision probability offers an alternative for a simplified definition of the forest canopy structure. The performance of such approach for estimation of the leaf chlorophyll content from satellite imaging spectroscopy data acquired by the CHRIS-PROBA sensor was investigated. The approach was compared to a computationally more demanding one based on a detailed 3 D structural description of a forest (chapter 5). For this purposes two canopy models, PARAS and DART, representing the first and second approach respectively, were used. Top-of-canopy bidirectional reflectance factors (BRF) were simulated for both models and used to calculate two optical indices, ANCB 670 – 720 and ANMB 670 – 720. Subsequently, the empirical relationships established between the optical indices and the needle-leaf chlorophyll content (Cab) were applied to the CHRIS-PROBA image of a Norway spruce forest stand to retrieve a map of Cab estimates. Results showed that for the spatial resolution of CHRIS-PROBA (17 m), the simpler model PARAS can be applied to retrieve plausible needle-leaf Cab estimates from satellite imaging spectroscopy data with less intensive model parameterization and reduced computational powerthan when using a model like DART. The ANMB 670 – 720 optical indexwas more robust andresulted in a linear relationship between the Cab estimated by both models. This relationship showed, however, a systematic offset that is potentially caused by differences in the implementation of woody elements in each model or by a different parameterization of leaf optical properties. Thus, further investigation on the impact of parameterization differences related to the needle optical properties and the implementation of woody elements in such a model is recommended...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} and improved clonal propagation of Alpinia calcarata, a commercially important medicinal plant was established on Murashige and Skoog medium. The axillary shoot proliferation was achieved with maximum 5. 2 ± 0. 7 shoots in 92. 8 % of rhizome explants in medium with 2. 0 mg/L 6 -benzylamiopurine (BAP) and 0. 2 mg/L indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA). Axillary shoot buds (60 %) upon subculture for 8 {{weeks in the}} same medium produced multiple shoot initials (12. 1 ± 0. 4) mediated with meristemoids (4. 0 ± 0. 5) and callus. A gradual reduction in the concentration of BAP or elimination of IAA was required for rapid induction of normal plants devoid of callus from propagules during subsequent subculture. Single clump of 3 - 4 multiple shoot initials during second subculture on medium with 1. 0 mg/L BAP and 0. 1 mg/L IAA yielded an average of 21 shoots which was best among different propagules tried. The shoot multiplication rate was further enhanced to 32 shoots when the similar propagules passed to third subculture on medium with 1. 0 mg/L BAP alone. <b>Clumps</b> of multiple <b>shoot</b> initials upon subculture on medium with 1. 0 mg/L BAP alone exhibited 10 fold multiplication rates. Use of liquid medium in culture bottles with polypropylene caps supported fast growth of the shoots and spontaneous root formation on 50 % of the shoots. Shoots transferred to half-strength MS liquid medium with 0. 2 mg/L of IAA and IBA was optimum for maximum roots (8. 14 ± 1. 34) in 100 % shoots. The rooted plants were hardened in mist chamber showed 95 % survival and well established in the field. The acclimatized plants showed rhizome formation after 4 - 6 weeks of growth under shade house. Volatile chemicals profile of the leaves, rhizome and root of the in vitro and conventionally propagated plants analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were qualitatively and quantitatively similar. The analysis of growth characteristics of 36 month old in vitro and conventionally propagated plants showed a 50 % increment of rhizome fresh biomass with prolific root and leaf growth in the former than the latter ones. The protocol described herein will have practical applications for the large scale production of uniform efficient plants for commercial cultivation of A. calcarata...|$|R

Fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens (Pursh.) Nutt.), a shrub native to western North America, provides forage with a high content of protein to cattle in dry and salty areas, and it is being used for regeneration of disturbed sites. In this research, methods for Atriplex regeneration and genetic transformation were developed with the objective of understanding gene functions as well as developing gene transfer technology for the improved quality of this native shrub. Organogenesis from leaf explants have been accomplished via culture on medium I [1 / 2 MS, IAA (0. I mg/]), BA (0. 5 mg/ 1), and NH 4 CI (450 mg/ 1) ] for one month, followed by culture in medium 11 [1 / 2 MS, 2, 4 -D (0. 01 mg/ 1), KT (0. 5 mg/ 1), and NH 4 CI (450 mg/ 1) ] for two more months with the organogenesis rate 12. 34 ?. 7 shoots per 3 mm diam. leaf disc. Seven rooted plants derived from organogenesis were transfeffed to a hydroponic solution. After one month, five of these plants survived and gained a two-fold increase in height. An average of 9 shoots was produced from a single axillary bud using multiplication medium I [1 / 2 MS plus IAA (0. 1 mg/ 1), BA (2 mg/ 1), and NH 4 CI (450 mgA) ] for one month and medium II [1 / 2 MS plus NAA (0. 01 mg/ 1), BA (2 mg/ 1) and NH 4 Cl(450 mg/ 1) ] for another month. Globular and heart-shaped somatic embryos as large as 3 mm in diameter were induced from leaf explant callus with the average rate of 20. 8 embryos induced per gram of embryogenic callus. Transformation of somatic embryogenic suspensions was acquired by particle bombardment with GUS expression detected in an x-gluc test 114. 89 ? 6. 3 blue spots per filter paper.
