Both can be seen as generalization of standard numeral systems, optimal for uniform probability distribution of digits, into optimized for some chosen probability distribution. Arithmetic or range coding corresponds to adding new information in the most significant position, while ANS generalizes adding information in the least significant position. Its <b>coding</b> <b>rule</b> is [...] "x goes to x-th appearance of subset of natural numbers corresponding to currently encoded symbol". In the presented example, sequence (01111) is encoded into a natural number 18, which is smaller than 45 obtained by using standard binary system, due to better agreement with frequencies of sequence to encode. The advantage of ANS is storing information in a single natural number, in contrast to two defining a range.|$|E

40|$|Physical (PHY) layer {{cooperation}} in a wireless network allows neighboring nodes {{to share their}} communication resources {{in order to create}} a virtual antenna array by means of distributed transmission and signal processing. A novel medium access control (MAC) protocol, called CoopMAC, has been recently proposed to integrate cooperation at the PHY layer with the MAC sublayer, thereby achieving substantial throughput and delay performance improvements. CoopMAC capitalizes on the broadcast nature of the wireless channel and rate adaptation, recruiting a single relay on the fly to support the communication of a particular source-destination pair. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer rate-adaptive design that opportunistically combines the recruitment of multiple cooperative nodes and carrier sensing multiple access with collision avoidance. We focus on a single-source single-destination setup, and develop a randomized cooperative framework, which is referred to as randomized CoopMAC (RCoopMAC). Thanks to the randomization of the <b>coding</b> <b>rule,</b> the RCoopMAC approach enables the blind participation of multiple relays at unison relying only on the mean channel state information (CSI) of the potential cooperating nodes, without introducing additional signaling overhead to coordinate the relaying process. The proposed RCoopMAC scheme is not only beneficial in substantially improving the link quality and therefore the sustainable data rates but, thanks to the decentralized and agnostic <b>coding</b> <b>rule,</b> it also allows to effectively recruit multiple relays in a robust fashion, i. e., even when the required mean CSI is partially outdated...|$|E

The Language has a universal grammar because the <b>coding</b> <b>rule</b> does not depend on such specific parameters and can then be ap-plied to any Sender-Receiver game with noisy communication...|$|E

Coding rules are customarily used to constrain the use (or abuse) of certain constructions in a programming language.
