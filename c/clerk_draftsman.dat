My father was on duty at the Philadelphia Navy-Yard, and we lived in that city. There {{was a young man}} who used to come to bring messages to father; I think he was a <b>clerk</b> or a <b>draftsman.</b> I do not remember his name, except that his first name was Rupert, and father always called him by that. He was a beautiful man-boy or boy-man, however you choose to put it. His eyes were heavenly blue, his skin was smooth and white, his cheeks were red, and he had the most charming mouth I ever saw. He was just the right height, well shaped, and wore the most becoming clothes. I fell madly in love with him the second time I saw him, and continued so for a long time. I used to think about him and dream about him, and write little poems about him which nobody ever saw. I tried to make a sketch of his face once, but I failed and tore it up." ...|$|R
