5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{is based}} on Graham's law, which states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas through a porous barrier is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas's molecular mass. In a <b>container</b> <b>with</b> a porous barrier containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is slightly enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is slightly depleted. A container wherein the enrichment process takes place through gaseous diffusion is called a diffuser.|$|E
5|$|Early {{research}} {{on the role of}} antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of unsaturated fats, which is the cause of rancidity. Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed <b>container</b> <b>with</b> oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption. However, it was the identification of vitamins A, C, and E as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of living organisms. The possible mechanisms of action of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized. Research into how vitamin E prevents the process of lipid peroxidation led to the identification of antioxidants as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions, often by scavenging reactive oxygen species before they can damage cells.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{notion of}} lemon juice being packaged inside lemon-shaped and coloured containers {{was the brainchild of}} Edward Hack in the 1950s. Bill Pugh, an English plastics designer, created a prototype based upon Hack's concept. The company Edward Hack, Ltd. then produced and marketed Hax brand lemon juice in the plastic containers, using juice from Sicily. Stanley Wagner of Coldcrops, Ltd. also independently designed a very similar package, which was used for Realemon brand lemon juice. Realemon was later renamed to ReaLem by Coldcrops. Hax lemon juice was the first to be packaged and marketed in said lemon-shaped <b>container,</b> <b>with</b> Coldcrops following shortly thereafter. A later agreement between Hax and Coldcrops led to Hax leaving the lemon juice business, whereby Coldcrops acquired the marketing rights for lemon juice in plastic lemon containers under the ReaLem brand. Coldcrops was acquired by Reckitt and Colman in 1956, which rebranded the product under the Jif brand name.|$|E
5|$|The plastic lemon {{container}} {{and the idea}} of marketing lemon juice in this manner was also undertaken independently by Stanley Wagner, a businessperson in the frozen food industry, and also a former Royal Air Force fighter pilot. Wagner's plastic lemon was produced by Shipton, a plastics company. Wagner was with the company Coldcrops, Ltd., which produced Realemon. The Realemon trademark was developed and used for a lemon juice product based upon reconstitution in the 1940s. Realemon was later renamed to ReaLem by Coldcrops. Hax lemon juice was the first to be packaged and marketed in said lemon-shaped <b>container,</b> <b>with</b> Coldcrops following shortly thereafter with their own design. It is of intrigue to some that both Pugh and Wagner were both former Royal Air Force pilots.|$|E
5|$|March 10 and 11 were {{dedicated}} to the scenes in Sang Min's warehouse. The team's assault of the warehouse was filmed by three separate units. Kono's fight sequence was included to assert to the audience {{that she would be}} a valuable asset to the team. In the scene where McGarrett shoots Sang Min's Mercedes-Benz before it crashes into a shipping container was done with two separate takes, the first of which involved O'Loughlin shooting blanks into a car. The car would swerve away. The second take saw the car crash into the <b>container</b> <b>with</b> O'Loughlin away from the shot as McGarrett was in close proximity to the car. The eighth day of filming was spent in a village of quonset huts where McGarrett and Danny chase Doran. In one part of the sequence, McGarrett jumps over the trunk of one car as it was hit from behind by another car. To make the scene a reality, the film crew made a three-part composite shot to ensure no harm came to O'Loughlin.|$|E

25|$|Gause’s 1930s lab {{experiments}} showed logistic {{growth in}} microorganisms. Populations of yeast grown in test tubes initially grew exponentially. But as resources became scarcer, their growth rates slowed until reaching the carrying capacity. If the populations {{were moved to}} a larger <b>container</b> <b>with</b> more resources they would continue to grow until reaching their new carrying capacity. The shape of their growth can be modeled very effectively with the logistic growth model.|$|E

25|$|Acclimation is {{a process}} that is {{performed}} when adding new marine life to an aquarium, particularly for invertebrates, who lack osmoregulation.

The dried pasta is then packaged: Fresh pasta is sealed in a clear, airtight plastic <b>container</b> <b>with</b> a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen that inhibits microbial growth and prolongs the product's shelf life; dried pastas are sealed in clear plastic or cardboard packages.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{carbonic}} maceration {{is also known}} as whole grape fermentation where instead of yeast being added, the grapes fermentation is encouraged to take place inside the individual grape berries. This method is common in the creation of Beaujolais wine and involves whole clusters of grapes being stored in a closed <b>container</b> <b>with</b> the oxygen in the container being replaced with carbon dioxide. Unlike normal fermentation where yeast converts sugar into alcohol, carbonic maceration works by enzymes within the grape breaking down the cellular matter to form ethanol and other chemical properties. The resulting wines are typically soft and fruity.|$|E
25|$|Because it is {{not always}} {{possible}} for the forensic entomologist to be present at a crime scene to collect the appropriate evidence, it is important that clear and concise instructions are left for the handling of live and preserved specimens to those processing the scene.

As a rule, if specimens are in transport longer than an hour, they have to be kept in a chilled insulated <b>container</b> <b>with</b> enough coolant to keep them relatively inactive and stop their development.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Prolonged {{efficacy}} {{of a combination}} of bacteria (Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis [Bti] and copepods (Mesocyclops aspericornis) in controlling immature forms of Aedes aegypti in peridomestic water containers was achieved by adding various products from local villages as supplementary food for copepods. In all experiments, 100 first-instar larvae were added into the breeding containers every day for eight weeks. Combinations of biological control agents and each local supplementary food were applied once {{at the beginning of the}} experiment. At the end of the experiment, the average number of mosquito larvae in <b>containers</b> <b>with</b> a combination of copepods and Bti with one gram of rice grain had decreased to only 0. 5 % of that with no control agent. In comparison, the average numbers of mosquito larvae in <b>containers</b> <b>with</b> Bti only, or copepods only, were approximately 10 % and 33 % of those in <b>containers</b> <b>with</b> no control agents, respectively. In addition, the number of copepods in <b>containers</b> <b>with</b> mosquito larvae and supplementary food was at least three times higher than those with mosquito larvae alone...|$|R
