40|$|Abstract. Introduction:. Neuroimaging reveals {{increased}} glutamate {{within the}} insula {{of patients with}} fibromyalgia (FM), suggesting a link between FM symptoms and increased central excitatory neurotransmission. Many patients with FM also present with decreased intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD), consistent with small fiber pathology. It remains unknown, however, whether either of these mechanistic findings represent a cause or {{a consequence of the}} other. This study tests the hypothesis that an excitatory imbalance within the insula leads to small fiber pathology. Objectives:. This is a proof-of-concept study to examine whether a chronic, bilateral increase in insular glutamate can be a causal factor in the development of small fiber neuropathy in FM. Methods:. The glutamate transport inhibitor l-trans-Pyrrolidine- 2, 4 -dicarboxylic acid (PDC), which increases endogenous levels of glutamate, was dissolved in Ringer solution and bilaterally delivered into the insula of rats for 6 weeks. Naive rats that did not undergo any surgery or treatment and rats administered Ringer vehicle solution into the insula served as controls. Multimodal nociceptive sensitivity was assessed weekly. Hind paw tissue biopsies were collected for IENFD assessment, {{at the end of the}} experiment. Results:. Compared with controls, increasing endogenous glutamate in the insula with PDC caused sustained decreases in mechanical paw withdrawal threshold and thermal paw withdrawal latency, increased aversion to noxious mechanical stimulation, and a decrease in IENFD. <b>Cold</b> <b>reactivity</b> was not altered by PDC administration. Conclusion:. Bilateral insular PDC administration produced a persistent increase in multimodal pain behaviors and a decrease in peripheral nerve fibers in rat. These preclinical findings offer preliminary support that insular hyperactivity may be a casual factor in the development of small fiber pathology in FM...|$|E
40|$|During {{the report}} period, {{the nature of}} the ORNL {{supporting}} activities gradually changed, reflecting the progress in the conetruction of the N. S. Savannah. Design reviews continued to require considerable attention. The Inspection Engineering Dept. of the Jab. continued to act as an inspection agency for the ALC, witnessing inspections and tests during fabrication of components of the nuclear reactor system. An enviromnental analysis was made of safeguard aspects of operation of the N. S. Savannah at the NYSC site in Cannden. A study of the safety response of the reactor on the ORNL Analog Computer further defined the important role of the Doppler coefficient in controlling reactivity excursions. Health physics aspects of the operation were studied. Limited waste disposal studies indicated that sea disposal of exhausted demineralizer resins may be facilitated by casting the radioactive resins into concrete. Installation of a pressurized-water in-pile test loop in the ORR neared completion. The neutron flux distribution in the loop was determined by experimental measurements in a nuclear mockup of the in-pile section. Metallurgical activities included nil-ductility testing of steel from the reactor vessel, chemical analyses of primary system components, and investigations of the properties of electroless - nickel brazed joints. Limited fabrication studies were carried out on advanced fuel concepts which may have merit for future cores of the Savannah Reactor. Most of the latter effort was applied to swaged UO/sub 2 / rod-type elements. A series of physics calculations is being carried out in an attempt to evaluate the possible advantages of using Zircaloy instead of stainless steel as the structural material for Core III. Use of Zircaloy instead of stainless steel for the fuel element cans was found to result in a marked reduction in enrichnnent for a given initial <b>cold</b> <b>reactivity.</b> (For preceding period see ORNL- 2657.)

40|$|The {{conceptual}} {{design of the}} MH- 1 A reactor was analyzed using machine codes and methods previously shown to give good agreement with experimental measurements for a similar core. The <b>cold</b> clean <b>reactivity</b> worths of all 12 control rods and {{of the most important}} control rod were calculated to be DELTA k = 0. 20 and DELTA k = 0. 035, respectively. This indicates that the reactor can be adequately shut down with one rod stuck in the fully-withdrawn position. A radial peak-to-average power ratio of 1. 63 was calculated for the case with followers in the core. The reactivity lifetime of the core was calculated to be 11 months for the initial core. Additional calculations showed that the first fuel shuffling&#x 27;&#x 27; gave a core with the same lifetime. (auth...|$|R
40|$|Flexblue® is a 160 [*]MWe, {{transportable}} and subsea-based {{nuclear power}} unit, operating up to 100 [*]m depth, several kilometers {{away from the}} shore. If being underwater has significant safety advantages, especially using passive safety systems, it leads to two main challenges for core design. The first one is to control reactivity in operation without soluble boron because of its prohibitive drawbacks for a submerged reactor (system size, maintenance, effluents, and safety considerations). The second one is to achieve a long cycle in order to maximise {{the availability of the}} reactor, because Flexblue® refuelling and maintenance will be performed in a shared support facility away from the production site. In this paper, these two topics are dealt with, from a neutronic point of view. Firstly, an overview of the main challenges of operating without soluble boron is proposed (<b>cold</b> shutdown, <b>reactivity</b> swing during cycle, load following, xenon stability). Secondly, an economic optimisation of the Flexblue® core size and cycle length is performed, using the QUABOX/CUBBOX code. Thirdly, the fuel enrichment and poisoning using gadolinium oxide are optimized for full core or half core refuelling, with the DRAGON code. For the specific case of the full core refuelling, an innovative heterogeneous configuration of gadolinium is used. This specific configuration is computed using a properly adapted state-of-the-art calculation scheme within the above-mentioned lattice code. The results in this specific configuration allow a reactivity curve very close to the core leakage one during the whole cycle...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Elevated serum {{bilirubin}} {{has been}} associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, serum bilirubin is also related with several potential confounders related to CVD, such as obesity. Mendelian randomization has been proposed as a method to address challenges to validity from confounding and reverse causality. It utilizes genotype to estimate causal relationships between a gene product and physiological outcomes. In this report, we demonstrate its use in assessing direct causal relations between serum bilirubin levels and CVD risk factors, including obesity, cholesterol, measures of vascular function and blood pressure. Methods Study subjects included 868 asymptomatic individuals. Study subjects were genotyped at the UGT 1 A 1 * 28 locus, which is strongly associated with bilirubin levels. Results Serum bilirubin levels were inversely associated with levels of several cardiovascular disease risk factors, including body mass index (p = 0. 003), LDL (p = 0. 0005) and total cholesterol (p = 0. 0002). In contrast, UGT 1 A 1 * 28 genotype, a known cause of elevated bilirubin levels, was not significantly associated with any of these traditional CVD risk factors. We did observe an association between genotype and brachial artery diameter (p = 0. 003) and <b>cold</b> pressor <b>reactivity</b> (p = 0. 01). Conclusions Our findings imply that the observed association of serum bilirubin levels with body mass index and cholesterol are likely due to confounding and suggest that previously established CVD benefits of increased bilirubin may in part be mediated by the early regulation of vascular structure and reactivity. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundThe aim of {{the present}} study was to compare three {{bronchial}} challenge tests for assessing bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) in twin pairs followed up from birth to school age. MethodsWe studied three different bronchial challenge tests (methacholine inhalation challenge, cold air inhalation challenge and exercise-bronchodilation tests) at school age in 29 children born at or before 38 weeks gestation (median 35 weeks gestation) from multiple pregnancies. The children had been followed up from birth and were examined at the age of 7 - 15 years (median age 10 years). ResultsBronchial hyperresponsiveness was found in 28 - 34 % of children when these tests were analyzed separately. Eight children (28 %) were exercise responders; two of them and three additional children were bronchodilator responders. Thus, 11 children (38 %) had a pathologic result in the exercise-bronchodilation test. Ten children (34 %) responded to cold air and nine children (31 %) responded to methacholine inhalation. At least one test was pathologic in 18 children (62 %), but only two children (7 %) responded in all three challenges. A positive result in the exercise-bronchodilation test was associated with <b>cold</b> air <b>reactivity,</b> but not with methacholine reactivity. The exercise and cold air tests detected predominantly the same children. No differences were found in bronchial challenge test results between children who, at birth, were appropriately grown and those who had intrauterine growth retardation. conclusionsBronchial hyperresponsiveness was common (up to 62 %) at school age in children born as moderately preterm. The outdoor exercise-bronchodilation test found 61 % of all BHR cases. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was not associated with intrauterine growth status. The most sensitive test was the cold air inhalation challenge and a good agreement was seen between this test and the exercise challenge outdoors...|$|R
40|$|The Nigeria Research Reactor- 1 (NIRR- 1) is a {{low power}} {{miniature}} neutron source reactor (MNSR) located at the Centre for Energy Research and Training, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria Nigeria. The reactor went critical with initial core excess reactivity of 3. 77 Â mk. The NIRR- 1 <b>cold</b> excess <b>reactivity</b> measured {{at the time of}} commissioning was determined to be 4. 97 Â mk, which is more than the licensed range of 3. 5 â 4 Â mk. Hence some cadmium poison worth â 1. 2 Â mk was inserted into one of the inner irradiation sites which act as reactivity regulating device {{in order to reduce the}} core excess reactivity to 3. 77 Â mk, which is within recommended licensed range of 3. 5 Â mk and 4. 0 Â mk. In this present study, the burn-up calculations of the NIRR- 1 fuel and the estimation of the core life time expectancy after 10 Â years (the reactor core expected cycle) have been conducted using the codes WIMS and CITATION. The burn-up analyses carried out indicated that the excess reactivity of NIRR- 1 follows a linear decreasing trend having 216 Effective Full Power Days (EFPD) operations. The reactivity worth of top beryllium shim data plates was calculated to be 19. 072 Â mk. The result of depletion analysis for NIRR- 1 core shows that (7. 9947 Â Â±Â  0. 0008) g of U- 235 was consumed for the period of 12 Â years of operating time. The production of the build-up of Pu- 239 was found to be (0. 0347 Â Â±Â  0. 0043) Â g. The core life time estimated in this research was found to be 30. 33 Â years.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} its industrial competitiveness and to satisfy blast furnace requirements, the cokemaking industry needs to produce coke of a higher quality. The injection of coal, oil, gas and plastics to replace coke at the tuyeres {{has now become a}} widely accepted technology in modern blast furnace operations and coke rates have decreased very rapidly. This injection practice has led to more severe quality requirements for coke. Furthermore, the coal market situation has changed tremendously in recent years with coal prices rising continuously. Thus, blends for coke production need to include non-coking coals and residues with a high carbon content (usually considered as inerts) such as petroleum coke, high or low-rank coals and various types of residues to ensure a flexible supply of raw materials and so bring about a reduction in the price of the final product. Coke properties such as <b>cold</b> mechanical strength, <b>reactivity</b> to CO 2 and strength after reaction (CSR) depend mainly on the composition of the blend. In the present work the impact of these additives on cokemaking has been examined by means of thermogravimetric analysis and by studying the changes in the thermoplastic properties of the blends containing such additives...|$|R
40|$|Cold and {{mechanical}} allodynia are important symptoms {{in patients with}} neuropathic pain. The study of cold allodynia in animals can help us to understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of neuropathic pain and to validate drugs. The evaluation of cold allodynia in gerbils with a chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve on the cold plate is not always stable. We developed a new application method of acetone using a specific spray technique with an Eppendorf (R) multistepper pipette. The chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve in gerbils resulted in a long-lasting mechanical and acetone spray-induced hyperreactivity throughout the testing period, which is clearly different from what was seen in sham-operated animals. The acetone spray test incorporates a multimodal stimulus different from direct <b>cold</b> stimulation. The <b>reactivity</b> to the acetone spray coincides in time and strength with the reactivity observed in mechanical allodynia in gerbils and with mechanical and thermal allodynia in other species. Furthermore, a pharmacological validation of the acetone spray test by different reference compounds was performed. Different compounds effective in neuropathic pain models in rodents influence the hyperreactivity to the acetone spray after acute and chronic administration. This study indicates that the multimodal acetone spray test is a valuable tool {{in the study of}} neuropathic pain in rodents. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Two {{industrial}} coal blends (B 1 and B 2) used in cokemaking {{were selected}} for this study. Two wastes from scrap tyres (TC, F) were added to these coal blends at different ratios (98 : 2 and 95 : 5). The investigation was focused on assessing {{the influence of the}} additives on thermoplastic properties of coal by means of the Gieseler fluidity test and thermogravimetric analysis. In addition, the blends were carbonized in a 17 kg electrically heated movable wall oven in order to examine the quality of the resultant cokes. Quality of the cokes produced was evaluated by measuring their <b>cold</b> mechanical strength, <b>reactivity</b> and post-reaction strength. It was found that ash composition of the additives contribute to a deterioration in coke quality. Moreover, F causes a greater decrease in coke strength after reaction with CO 2 due to the diminution of bulk density in the coking process and to the higher basicity index. Trace elements were also studied in relation to waste addition. The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Research Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS) research programme under grant agreement No. RFCR-CT- 2010 - 00007 and contract No. RFCR-CT- 2006 - 00002.

40|$|International audienceReactions of {{elementary}} mercury {{in the gas}} phase (GEM) have been investigated at the DFT level {{in the presence of}} halogen radicals and/or halogen anions. In the presence of radicals, the formation of HgX 3. and HgX 42. is predicted to be favourable. Moreover, in the presence of anions, the free-radical liberation is enhanced from these two species allowing the presence of halogen free radicals even without the presence of light radiation. This enhancement is associated with the formation of HgX 3 -, which is predicted to be the most stable species. In solution, redox chemistry can occur and transform GEM in the presence of X 2. The redox potentials of the couples HgX 2 /Hg for X=Cl, Br and I were calculated to be 0. 52, 0. 48 and 0. 04 V, respectively. This study gives new opportunities to elucidate the environmental chemistry of Hg in the polar regions. In these areas GEM has a unique and fast reactivity due to a combination of factors such as the polar sunrise, the presence of halogenated radicals, snow and ice surfaces and <b>cold</b> temperatures. This <b>reactivity,</b> known as atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs), leads to the deposition of significant amounts of Hg 2 + in these regions. The reaction pathways of AMDEs are as yet unknown and the DFT approach may contribute to their elucidation and to the proposal of new mechanisms. Additionally, this study introduces hypotheses concerning the reactivity of GEM inside snowpacks...|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{investigate}} whether normotensive young adults with {{family history of}} hypertension demonstrate exaggerated cardiovascular responses to both mental and physical stimuli as compared to normotensive young adults without family history of hypertension. Methods Normotensive undergraduate students of normotensive parents (n = 40) and of hypertensive father/ mother/ both (n = 40), aged 20 – 30 years, performed serial subtraction test in a sitting position for three minutes. After taking a rest, subjects performed cold pressor test in ninety seconds. In each test, blood pressure and pulse rate were recorded in pre-test, during test, and post-test using an automated oscillometric device. Changes score rather than absolute scores were analyzed using independent t-test or Mann-Whitney. Results There were no significantly differences in age, body mass index, fasting blood sugar, and plasma creatinine between the two groups. Normotensives of hypertensive parents had significantly higher offi ce systolic blood pressure (108. 33 ±  1. 6 vs 103. 00 ±  1. 6 mmHg) and delta change score of cardiovascular reactivity to serial subtraction test (MABP  19. 13 ±  1. 4 vs 15. 5 ±  1. 0 mmHg, P = 0. 04), but not to cold pressor test (MABP 24. 26  ±  1. 7 vs 21. 74  ±  1. 7 mmHg) than those of normotensive parents. Conclusion Normotensive young adults with family history of hypertension demonstrated exaggerated cardiovascular reactivity to mental test but not to physical test. As compared to normotensive young adults without family history of hypertension However, this familial difference in cardiovascular reactivity to mental test is confused with office blood pressure.
