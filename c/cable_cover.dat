40|$|The {{stay cables}} on {{cable-stayed}} bridges {{have been the}} subject of considerable research in order to understand the origins of the dry galloping phenomenon. Surface irregularity is one of the last parameters that have not been thoroughly examined. This paper focuses on static wind tunnel tests on original High Density Polyethylene <b>cable</b> <b>covers</b> in a range of Reynolds numbers from the sub-critical regime to the critical, corresponding to values ranging from Re = 9. 6 x 104 to Re = 3. 3 x 105. The experiment consists in testing <b>cable</b> <b>covers</b> of various diameters in order to investigate the effect of surface irregularity (roughness and circularity defect) on the mechanism of dry galloping excitation. Previous studies reported that dry galloping is caused by the appearance of a negative pressure bubble on one side of the circular cylinder at the critical Reynolds number range, leading to a rapid drop in the drag coefficient and the appearance of a non-negligible lift force. The results of the present investigation demonstrate that there is a clear correlation between the single bubble pressure pattern and the circularity defect along the tube. They further show that surface roughness has little effect on the location of the bubble. The paper also treats the spatial and temporal correlation of the instantaneous pressure pattern along the tube with respect to the circularity defect. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{irregularity}} {{is one of}} {{the parameters}} that have not been deeply examined on stay cables of cable-stayed bridges. This paper focuses on wind tunnel tests on original High Density Polyethylene <b>cable</b> <b>covers,</b> in a range of Reynolds numbers from the sub-critical regime to the critical one, corresponding to values ranging from Re = 9. 6 x 104 to Re = 3. 3 x 105. The experiment consists in measurement of parietal pressures on <b>cable</b> <b>covers</b> in order to investigate the effect of surface irregularity on the mechanism of dry galloping excitation. Previous studies ([1], [3] and [4]) reported that dry galloping of cables with a circular cross section is linked to the appearance of a negative pressure bubble, {{on one side of the}} circular cylinder at the critical Reynolds number range, leading locally to a rapid drop in the drag coefficient and the appearance of a no negligible lift force. But such a steady change in local lift force does not generate an alternate excitation on a whole cable. The question of the spatial correlation of this “one bubble “ regime along a cable in real conditions and the capability of this lift force to be varied with time are still not resolved. The present paper aims at showing one first exploration of the spatial and temporal correlation of the pressure pattern along the HDPE tube with respect to the natural circularity defect. The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) was used to characterize the bi-stability phenomenon occurring at critical Reynolds number regime...|$|R

50|$|The jumping cavesson, or jumping hackamore, seen in English riding, {{is a heavy}} noseband made of a <b>cable</b> <b>covered</b> with leather. It differs {{slightly}} from a sidepull in that the reins attach farther back, {{on either side of}} the jaw, rather than at the cheeks. It allows greater control of speed, but has less lateral control than a sidepull. A related piece of equipment, called the longeing cavesson or lungeing cavesson, is not used for riding, but rather for longeing (US) (lungeing (UK)), long-lining the horse from the ground, and vaulting. It consists of a heavy noseband with rings at the top and cheeks, held on by a sturdy headstall that will not slip when pressure from the line is applied. Both designs have antecedents in the classic cavesson utilized by European masters such as William Cavendish, and can be dated to the 17th century, and probably earlier.|$|R

5000|$|From {{a digital}} point of view, ribbon cable was an ideal way to connect two devices. However, from an analog point of view, these cables are problematic. Around 1980, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) {{discovered}} that ribbon cables were highly efficient antennas, broadcasting essentially random signals {{across a wide}} band of the electromagnetic spectrum. These unintended signals could interfere with domestic TV reception, putting [...] "snow" [...] on the screen. The FCC issued edicts and injunctions to the personal-computer industry, restricting the use of ribbon cables to connect devices together. [...] "Naked" [...] ribbon cable could be used inside {{the case of a}} computer or peripheral device, but any ribbon cable connecting two boxes together had to be grounded. This rule led to solutions such as ribbon <b>cables</b> <b>covered</b> by a copper-braid shield, which made it impossible to see or separate the individual connectors. On the Apple II, these cables passed through the holes {{on the back of the}} computer that were grounded to the power supply. Eventually, ribbon connectors were replaced, for inter-connect purposes, by a wide profusion of custom-designed round cables with molded connectors.|$|R
