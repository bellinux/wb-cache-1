Skaldak laments the loss of his daughter and his people; however, the Doctor tries to comfort him with the knowledge that the Ice Warriors still live, just not on Earth or Mars. Skaldak escapes from his armour - an act of great dishonour - and stops broadcasting the signal to the other Ice Warriors because he believes himself to be the only one of his kind left. The Doctor surmises that, thinking himself to be the last of his kind, Skaldak has nothing left to lose. He manages to grab and kill three members of the crew.|$|E

5|$|At the Sabre store opening, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{attempts}} {{to put on}} a theatrical presentation to impress Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). Dwight assigns the members of his team various tasks: Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is to act like a hipster to make the Sabre Pyramid more appealing, Cathy (Lindsey Broad) is to flirt with the bloggers, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) is to give a presentation to wow the critics, and Todd Packer (David Koechner) is to play the part of a sexual predator— much to Packer's chagrin. As the grand opening progresses, things begin to fall apart. Several bloggers notice Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) using his old cell phone instead of his Sabre Arrowhead phone, resulting in a reprimand from Nellie. Erin disappears with a group of seniors after Dwight drives them away, fearing their age will frighten the youth. Ryan has a panic attack and, after being consoled by Dwight and Jim— who imitate Kelly and his mother respectively in an attempt to <b>calm</b> <b>him</b> down— leaves to go to his parents' house. Jim is forced to give the presentation, which, despite a rocky start, impresses the crowd. After the opening, Dwight is named vice president by Nellie.|$|E

Outside the castle, Erik's tutor Dionysius Beurreus found the king {{in a state}} of madness. Beurreus' efforts to <b>calm</b> <b>him</b> were to no avail - instead, the king issued an order to kill Beurreus as well and {{vanished}} into a nearby forest. Eventually the guards stabbed Beurreus to death. The killings were not made public: the castle was locked, and at the gate Per Gadd's guards continued to accept food for the prisoners from their relatives as usual.|$|E
25|$|Howard and Harold are {{helicopter}} {{parents to}} Clyde {{and tend to}} be overprotective of him. Howard feels {{the need to protect}} Clyde at all times and never lets him out of sight, unless he is with Lincoln or at school. Howard is also sensitive and overemotional, often needing Harold to <b>calm</b> <b>him</b> down when he gets worked up. Harold's demeanor is the opposite; he is straightforward and even-tempered. Both of the McBrides have a fondness for cats and have adopted two, Cleopawtra and Nepurrtiti (named after Cleopatra and Nefertiti, two Egyptian queens). Their surname is ironic because a bride is a newlywed woman, but they are two married men.|$|E

25|$|Lola starts {{running again}} and leaps over the punk and his dog. Running to the bank, she avoids {{the woman with}} the baby carriage, who in a flash forward joins a church and devotes herself to God.

Lola falls onto the bonnet of Mr. Meier's car, preventing his collision with the white BMW, allowing him to pick up Lola's dad on time. Since Lola can no longer speak to her dad, she continues running until she encounters a casino. Having only 99 marks, she convinces the cashier to give her a 100 mark chip.

500|$|Peter {{mentions}} {{wanting to}} watch [...] "G.I. José," [...] {{which leads to}} a cutaway parodying the [...] public service announcements. Peter mentions the film Fletch while playing charades. One of the many passing-time gags involves Peter performing a sing-a-long to the opening chase music from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. As Brian's hallucinations begin to worsen, Stewie attempts to <b>calm</b> <b>him,</b> reminding him that seeing Lady Gaga nude was a worst-case scenario. Towards the end of the episode, a cutaway gag involving a confrontation between an African American woman and an Italian American man parodies the National Geographic's documentaries. A reference to the social networking site Twitter was also made by Stewie.|$|E
500|$|At {{a midnight}} {{show the same}} month, four men rushed onto the stage in an {{apparent}} attack. Security men leapt to Presley's defense, and the singer's karate instinct took over as he ejected one invader from the stage himself. Following the show, he became obsessed {{with the idea that}} the men had been sent by Mike Stone to kill him. Though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans, he raged, [...] "There's too much pain in me... Stone [...] die." [...] His outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to <b>calm</b> <b>him,</b> despite administering large doses of medication. After another two full days of raging, Red West, his friend and bodyguard, felt compelled to get a price for a contract killing and was relieved when Presley decided, [...] "Aw hell, let's just leave it for now. Maybe it's a bit heavy." ...|$|E

500|$|... is {{the third}} member of Taka. His clan {{has the ability to}} use senjutsu, but due to the severe amount of natural energy they absorb they are prone to fits of extreme violence, with {{additional}} side effects being that they can revert to a childlike form if they use it the wrong way. Because of this, in childhood, Jugo was an outcast, eventually finding solace in Kimimaro whom he saw as an older sibling. After meeting Sasuke, he tried to refuse being part of Taka and used his abilities, but Sasuke managed to <b>calm</b> <b>him</b> down. As Kimimaro was the only other person who could do this, Jugo decided to follow Sasuke in the belief that he was Kimimaro's reincarnation. Jugo is voiced by Shuhei Sakaguchi in Japanese and by Travis Willingham in the English dub except in Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Patrick Seitz.|$|E
500|$|The {{young soldier}} is {{unaware of what}} is happening, at first – he asks why the bugles are blowing, and why the Sergeant looks so pale, but is told that Deever is being hanged, and that the {{regiment}} is drawn up in [...] "ollow square" [...] to see it. He presses the Sergeant further, in the second verse – why are people breathing so hard? why are some men collapsing? These signs of the effect that watching the hanging has upon {{the men of the}} regiment are explained away by the Sergeant as being due to the cold weather or the bright sun. The voice is reassuring, keeping the young soldier calm in the sight of death, just as the Sergeant will <b>calm</b> <b>him</b> with his voice in combat. In the third verse, Files thinks of Deever, saying that he slept alongside him, and drank with him, but the Sergeant reminds him that Deever is now alone, that he sleeps [...] "out an' far to-night", and reminds the soldier of the magnitude of Deever's crime – ...|$|E
500|$|JJ visits his psychiatrist, Dr Felly (Paul Ridley), {{seeking help}} for his recent bouts {{of rage and}} his {{confusion}} about his life and friends. Dr Felly has poor advice for JJ and prescribes him more drugs to <b>calm</b> <b>him</b> down. As he is leaving, he meets Emily, {{who came to the}} clinic to receive counselling in being more honest, but was simply prescribed the same drugs as JJ. She comes out to him and he shares with her his longing to be [...] "normal" [...] for a day so that he could lose his virginity and reunite Freddie and Cook. She advises him to just ask for the things he wants, so they visit Freddie to tell him to make up with Cook. At Freddie's house, though, they walk in on Freddie having sex with Emily's twin sister, Katie (Megan Prescott), and JJ accidentally outs Emily as a lesbian, leaving Katie looking visibly shaken.
