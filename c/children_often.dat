Despite the Ponticelli family's hard work, they were impoverished and the <b>children</b> <b>often</b> went to bed on an empty stomach. When Lazare was two years of age, his mother moved to France to earn a better living. After the unexpected deaths of Jean Ponticelli and his eldest son, Pierre, {{the rest of the family}} moved to Paris, leaving Lazare in the care of neighbors.|$|E

5|$|Meningitis is {{an acute}} {{inflammation}} of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known collectively as the meninges. The most common symptoms are fever, headache, and neck stiffness. Other symptoms include confusion or altered consciousness, vomiting, and an inability to tolerate light or loud noises. Young <b>children</b> <b>often</b> exhibit only nonspecific symptoms, such as irritability, drowsiness, or poor feeding. If a rash is present, it may indicate a particular cause of meningitis; for instance, meningitis caused by meningococcal bacteria may {{be accompanied by a}} characteristic rash.|$|E
5|$|Prisoners {{would often}} take their {{families}} with them, {{which meant that}} entire communities sprang up inside the debtors' jails. The community created its own economy, with jailers charging for room, food, drink and furniture, or selling concessions to others, and attorneys charging fees in fruitless efforts to get the debtors out. Prisoners' families, including <b>children,</b> <b>often</b> had to find employment simply {{to cover the cost}} of the imprisonment.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} men aged 16 – 60 {{were immediately}} {{incorporated into the}} Volkssturm. However, some Volkssturm members, without basic military knowledge and training, escaped into the woods, hoping to simply survive. Refugee trains leaving East Prussia were also extremely crowded, and due to the very low temperatures, <b>children</b> <b>often</b> froze to death during the journey. The last refugee train left Königsberg on January 22, 1945.|$|E
5|$|When parents die of HIV/AIDS, {{extended}} family members usually become the children's primary caregivers: in Malawi, 44% of double orphans are adopted by grandparents or other close relatives. Extended family members often provide crucial support to HIV/AIDS orphans; however, some sources indicate that {{extended family}} members mistreat orphans whose parents {{have died from}} HIV/AIDS. For example, family members {{who are unable to}} support adopted <b>children</b> <b>often</b> arrange early marriages for female orphans, who may then become victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse.|$|E
5|$|When unoccupied, the {{children}} tended {{to their own}} needs and played with toy marbles and hobby horses. Some learned to count by playing hide and seek. Play was primarily for inculcating virtuous traits like courage and loyalty, but it also made life more tolerable. Black and white children played together {{before the age of}} ten, but separated afterwards based on the demands of work. <b>Children</b> <b>often</b> helped the adults, and performed chores (like fetching wood or water) that quickly escalated into full work responsibilities.|$|E

50|$|In some {{indigenous}} communities, <b>children</b> are <b>often</b> integrated {{as active}} participants into {{family and community}} work. <b>Child</b> work is <b>often</b> a vital contribution towards community productivity and typically involves non-exploitative motivations for children's engagement in work activities.|$|R
5|$|A 2002 study {{conducted}} by CARE International across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV/AIDS has affected economic well-being in rural Malawi. When skilled laborers are infected with HIV, they are usually unable to work; therefore, they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor-intensive crops, sacrificing the opportunity to grow more profitable, labor-intensive crops such as tobacco. When family members fall ill with HIV/AIDS, their relatives invest time in their treatment and care, further reducing household productivity. In addition, when family members are infected with HIV, households often use the money they would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses, further decreasing economic stability at the household level. Finally, when adults contract HIV, their <b>children</b> <b>often</b> remain home from school {{to work in the}} fields, threatening long-term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|Typically, people {{infected}} with dengue virus are asymptomatic (80%) or have only mild {{symptoms such as}} an uncomplicated fever. Others have more severe illness (5%), and in a small proportion it is life-threatening. The incubation period (time between exposure and onset of symptoms) ranges from 3 to 14 days, but most often it is 4 to 7 days. Therefore, travelers returning from endemic areas are unlikely to have dengue if fever or other symptoms start more than 14days after arriving home. <b>Children</b> <b>often</b> experience symptoms {{similar to those of}} the common cold and gastroenteritis (vomiting and diarrhea) and have a greater risk of severe complications, though initial symptoms are generally mild but include high fever.|$|E
5|$|With treatment, {{symptoms}} {{should improve}} within 36hours. About 50% {{of people will}} recover without treatment {{within a few days}} or weeks. Fluoroquinolones are not recommended as a first treatment. The Infectious Diseases Society of America states this due to the concern of generating resistance to this class of medication. Amoxicillin-clavulanate appears less effective than other options. Despite this precaution, some resistance has developed to all of these medications related to their widespread use. Trimethoprim alone is deemed to be equivalent to TMP/SMX in some countries. For simple UTIs, <b>children</b> <b>often</b> respond to a three-day course of antibiotics. Women with recurrent simple UTIs may benefit from self-treatment upon occurrence of symptoms with medical follow-up only if the initial treatment fails.|$|E

5000|$|The Poor Law Act of 1601 had, {{among its}} {{provisions}} [...] "the putting out {{of children to}} be apprentices". An agreement was made between the churchwarden and an employer, {{by means of an}} indenture sworn before a Justice of the Peace, that the latter would provide for and give employment and training to a pauper <b>child.</b> <b>Often</b> this worked {{for the benefit of the}} <b>child</b> but <b>often</b> it was seen by employers as a source of cheap labour and a way for a parish to relieve itself of responsibility. In the absence of any local labour, this was the course taken by Needham and Frith.|$|R

Many mutualistic organisms are transmitted vertically.|$|R
50|$|During {{attacks in}} infants, the <b>child</b> <b>often</b> looks startled or terrified and can scream inconsolably.
