5000|$|An enantiopure drug is a {{pharmaceutical}} {{that is available}} in one specific enantiomeric form. Most biological molecules (proteins, sugars, etc.) are present in {{only one of many}} chiral forms, so different enantiomers of a <b>chiral</b> <b>drug</b> molecule bind differently (or not at all) to target receptors. One enantiomer of a drug may have a desired beneficial effect while the other may cause serious and undesired side effects, or sometimes even beneficial but entirely different effects. Advances in industrial chemical processes have made it economical for pharmaceutical manufacturers to take drugs that were originally marketed as a racemic mixture and market the individual enantiomers, either by specifically manufacturing the desired enantiomer or by resolving a racemic mixture. On a case-by-case basis, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed single enantiomers of certain drugs to be marketed under a different name than the racemic mixture. [...] Also case-by-case, the United States Patent Office has granted patents for single enantiomers of certain drugs.

40|$|Pharmaceuticals and {{illicit drugs}} have been {{detected}} within wastewater and environmental matrices for several years now. However, to date, little emphasis has been placed upon the enantiomeric profile of those drugs. This may however lead to erroneous estimations of toxicity as the enantiomeric profile of <b>chiral</b> <b>drugs</b> {{plays an important role}} in both their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. Chiral analysis and enantioselective toxicology is well established within drug design, however ecotoxicology and analysis of <b>chiral</b> <b>drugs</b> in the environment is still usually assessed using whole parent drugs. This talk will comprise two related topics, firstly the development of a novel method to analyse <b>chiral</b> <b>drugs</b> from both liquid and solid complex matrices and secondly the study of the mechanisms involved in the transformation of <b>chiral</b> <b>drugs</b> within the environment. Enantiomeric profiling of <b>chiral</b> <b>drugs</b> within liquid environmental matrices has been demonstrated previously. However we have now also developed and validated a novel method which allows for the enantiomeric profiling of 25 chiral pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs from solid matrices (including illicit amphetamine-like drugs, beta blockers, anti-depressants, an anti-arrhythmic, an analgesic and a bronchodilator). This will allow for a more accurate measurement of environmental concentrations of <b>drugs</b> using <b>chiral</b> methodologies, particularly those which preferentially adsorb to solid material, as well as the study of enantiomeric profiles from solid matrices. Using this novel methodology in combination with established methods for liquid matrices we can present concentrations and enantiomeric fractions from a much wider variety of matrices than has been previously presented giving a more detailed picture of where and how <b>chiral</b> <b>drugs</b> transform within the environment. Results from wastewater and receiving waters will be presented. In brief, the methodology includes freeze drying, microwave assisted extraction followed by Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) and finally chiral Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (chiral LC-MS/MS). In order to study the mechanisms involved in the transformation and degradation of pharmaceuticals and illicit <b>chiral</b> <b>drugs</b> within receiving waters, microcosms (90 % river water, 10 % wastewater effluent) were set up to study biological (anoxic and aerobic, in the presence and absence of light) and abiotic factors (oxygenated, anoxic, light and dark processes). These were spiked with a mixture of 25 <b>chiral</b> <b>drugs</b> and samples taken every day for 2 weeks.

40|$|Due to {{concerns}} regarding {{the release of}} pharmaceuticals into {{the environment and the}} understudied impact of stereochemistry of pharmaceuticals on their fate and biological potency, we focussed in this paper on stereoselective transformation pathways of selected chiral pharmaceuticals (16 pairs) at both microcosm (receiving waters and activated sludge wastewater treatment simulating microcosms) and macrocosm (wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) utilising activated sludge technology and receiving waters) scales in order to test the hypothesis that biodegradation of <b>chiral</b> <b>drugs</b> is stereoselective. Our monitoring programme of a full scale activated sludge WWTP and receiving environment revealed that several <b>chiral</b> <b>drugs,</b> those being marketed mostly as racemates, are present in wastewater and receiving waters enriched with one enantiomeric form (e. g. fluoxetine, mirtazapine, salbutamol, MDMA).

40|$|In this review, {{we examine}} the problem of low configurational {{stability}} as encountered {{for a number of}} chiral drugs and resulting in racemization or epimerization. The focus is on implications in medicinal chemistry and drug research. When configurational stability is truly low and results in half-lives of racemization or epimerization in the order of minutes or hours, the phenomenon has pharmacological significance. When, in contrast, the half-lives of racemization or epimerization are in the order of months or years, the phenomenon has pharmaceutical significance and may shorten the shelf-live of the drug. A fast method exists to determine the configurational stability of drug candidates having a chiral centre of the type R '' R'RC-H, namely proton-deuterium exchange. The reaction has the considerable advantage that it can be performed with the racemate. In other wards, it allows <b>chiral</b> <b>drug</b> candidates to be screened for configurational stability prior to their resolution. A qualitative estimate of configurational stability is feasible, since the substituents around the chiral carbon play a determining role in stabilizing or destabilizing the configurational stability of chiral carbons. In contrast, a quantitative prediction of rates of racemization appears practically impossible at present in view of the marked influence of salvation effects. Many examples indicate a mechanism of general-base catalysis in reactions of isomerization. The pharmacological implication is that racemization or epimerization of chiral compounds in biological media can be expected to be catalyzed by a variety of endogenous buffers such as plasma proteins, amines, and perhaps thiolates, phosphate and bicarbonate. Thus, it will not be possible to deduce rates of in vivo chiral inversion of drugs from results obtained in non-biological media.
