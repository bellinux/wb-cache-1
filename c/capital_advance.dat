[...] There were {{various kinds of}} [...] "perquisites." [...] One such was an extra charge: {{this might be a}} commission (dasturi), tribute (salami), or simply [...] "expenses" [...] (kharcha). Another was a deduction of a portion of the <b>capital</b> <b>advance.</b> Yet another was using debased currency to pay the weaver. The gomastha and his appraisers, sometimes in collusion with Company officials, would falsely appraise cloth quality. They would charge the Company for high quality, but pay the weaver for low quality.The gomastas' profound knowledge about a particular area and their negotiating ability with local smaller merchants would be indispensable to firms.|$|E

5000|$|When capitalists begin {{production}} they initially {{spend their}} money on two inputs. These inputs can be represented with the <b>capital</b> <b>advanced</b> equation: where C is <b>capital</b> <b>advanced,</b> c is constant capital, and v is variable capital. Constant capital {{is nothing more than}} the means of production (factories, machinery, raw materials, etc.). Constant capital has a fixed value which can be transferred to the commodity, though the value added to the commodity can never be more than the value of constant capital itself. The source of surplus value comes instead from Variable capital or labor power. Labor power is the only commodity capable of producing more value than it possesses.|$|R

Marx furthermore assumed, that at the point where a new output had been produced, its cost-price (a sum of money-capital representing materials costs, wage costs and operating costs) was a given, unchangeable datum, and he considered that price-value discrepancies of inputs bought were irrelevant to his analysis, since it was the value of this new output (and not the value of <b>capital</b> <b>advanced)</b> that was being related to a general price level and a general profitability level in the markets where the output was sold.|$|R

50|$|The {{demonstration}} {{of the relation between}} commodities' unit values and their respective prices is known in Marxian terminology as the transformation problem or the transformation of values into prices of production. The transformation problem has probably generated the greatest bulk of debate about the LTV. The problem with transformation is to find an algorithm where the magnitude of value added by labor, in proportion to its duration and intensity, is sufficiently accounted for after this value is distributed through prices that reflect an equal rate of return on <b>capital</b> <b>advanced.</b> If there is an additional magnitude of value or a loss of value after transformation, then the relation between values (proportional to labor) and prices (proportional to total <b>capital</b> <b>advanced)</b> is incomplete. Various solutions and impossibility theorems have been offered for the transformation, but the debate has not reached any clear resolution.|$|R

5000|$|Marx's critics {{interpreting}} his models often argue {{he keeps}} assuming {{what he needs}} to explain, because rather than really [...] "transforming values into prices" [...] by some quantitative mapping procedure, such that prices are truly deduced from labour-values, he either (1) equates value quantities and price quantities, or else (2) he combines both value quantities and price quantities in one equation.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the effects of human <b>capital,</b> <b>advanced</b> {{manufacturing}} technologies (AMT), and new work organizational practices on firm productivity, while taking into account the synergies existing between them. This study expands current knowledge in this area in two ways. First, in contrast with previous works, we focus on AMT and not ICT (information and communication technologies). Second, we use a unique employer-employee data set for small firms in a particular area of southern Europe (Catalonia, Spain). Using a small firm data set, allows us to analyse the particular case of small and medium enterprises, since we cannot assume they have the same characteristics as large firms. The results provide evidence in favor of the complementarity hypothesis between human <b>capital,</b> <b>advanced</b> manufacturing technologies, and new work organization practices, although we show that the complementarity effects depend on what type of work organization practices are used by a firm. For small and medium Catalan firms, the only set of work organization practices that improve the benefits of human capital and technology investment are those practices which are more quality oriented, such as quality circles, problem-solving groups or total quality management.
