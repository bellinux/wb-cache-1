40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the way in which}} an elementary school principal (myself) <b>created</b> relational <b>trust</b> with parents during my first year in a new school. I investigated types of interactions between parents and myself that garnered trust and those that did not. Using data from a pilot study in a previous school I honed the focus of this study from my original topic of creating parental involvement in schools to looking at what leaders do to <b>create</b> <b>trust.</b> More specifically I asked the following question: As a new principal, how do I go about <b>creating</b> relational <b>trust</b> with parents and various stakeholders? ^ To answer this question data were collected through the process of journaling, baseline data on principal interactions taken from Principals in Action (Morris, Crowson, Porter-Gehrie 2 ̆ 6 Hurwitz, 1984), School District of Philadelphia Parent Satisfaction surveys and video recordings of my interactions with parents. The data was examined to see which interactions resulted in the creation of trust between the parent and myself. I used the data to assess my ability to deal with situations and utilize them to <b>create</b> <b>trust</b> with parents. ^ I intended for this study further my understanding of my role in <b>creating</b> <b>trust</b> with parents, as well as understanding the challenges that new school leaders face in <b>creating</b> <b>trust.</b> Additionally I wanted to focus on how a new principal dealt with entry into a new school setting and what kind of <b>trust</b> was <b>created</b> in this entry process. While I met with much success in <b>creating</b> <b>trust</b> in my entry to a new leadership position, it did not come without difficult situations where trust was not built. It made clear to my what my strengths and weaknesses in trust building were, and how I capitalized on the former and worked to improve the latter. The data showed that my attempts to <b>create</b> <b>trust</b> with parents were successful and that this capital helped to calm tense or volatile situations. The study then suggests the importance for new school leaders to build trust as they enter new schools, the value that this brings and relationships it can help the school leader create. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the question whether}} {{it is possible to}} <b>create</b> <b>trust</b> by the use of legislation. I ask the question whether the Swedish District Heating Act (DHA) can be deemed to be fit for its purpose. I show that the main purpose of the DHA is the creation of trust. On a more concrete level, therefore, my research task is to evaluate whether the DHA has the potential to <b>create</b> <b>trust.</b> I examine the concept of trust with a multi-disciplinary approach, drawing on trust research from various disciplines, e. g. law, economics, sociology and psychology. Against the background of this examination, I argue that the <b>trust</b> <b>creating</b> purpose of the DHA could be understood either as a purpose to <b>create</b> personal <b>trust</b> or as a purpose to <b>create</b> system <b>trust.</b> Personal trust is defined as trust in a specific district heating company, whereas system trust is defined as trust in district heating in an institutional sense. As the trust-creating purpose of the DHA can be understood in either of these two senses, the feasibility of achieving either of these, understood as objectives of the DHA, is evaluated. The evaluations show that the regulatory design of the DHA partly contains elements which could <b>create</b> personal <b>trust,</b> but are detrimental to <b>creating</b> system <b>trust,</b> and partly contains elements which could <b>create</b> system <b>trust,</b> but are detrimental to <b>creating</b> personal <b>trust.</b> This contradictory regulatory design of the DHA leaves the evaluations with a pessimistic conclusion: the DHA can only be deemed to have poor potential to be fit for its purpose to <b>create</b> <b>trust,</b> regardless of the main purpose of the DHA is understood as <b>creating</b> personal <b>trust</b> or system trust. To rectify the situation, I put forward different regulatory ideas for the legislature to consider. The main point of my suggestions {{is that it is not}} possible to induce both personal trust and system trust at the same time. Therefore, if trust creation is the main purpose of regulation, the legislature ought to choose between creation of personal trust or system trust. If personal trust is chosen, I argue that self-regulation is the best way to go; if system trust is chosen, I argue that strict regulation with mandatory rules and sufficient monitoring and enforcement is needed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to explore the {{preconditions}} for trust formation using a comparative approach. It takes an empirical point of departure, in two longitudinal and ethnographically inspired studies in the differing contexts of Sweden and Tanzania. The comparison reveals many similarities between the contexts {{with regard to the}} influence of informal institutions, as well as the significance of categories in trust formation. Perhaps surprisingly, trust and co-operation are not as low as could be expected in Tanzania, given the inadequate formal institutional environment, but instead, the greater need for co-operation evoked entrepreneurial initiatives that enabled the creation of trust. While the Swedish small-business owners could afford their ‘tribalism’, Tanzanians <b>created</b> <b>trust</b> in an entrepreneurial way. The importance of interventions to understand the local institutional framework is highlighted and it is argued that arranging business training, or similar events, is a fruitful way to facilitate the trust creation process in development contexts...|$|E

Currently, liver transplantation {{is the most}} common therapeutic option for patients with end-stage chronic liver disease. Due to {{decrease in the number of}} organ donors, many in need of transplantation continue to remain on the waiting list. Hepatic Tissue Engineering is a step toward alleviating the need for organ donors. Regenerative medicine and tissue engineering require two complementary key ingredients as follows: 1) biologically compatible scaffolds that can be readily adopted by the body system without harm, and 2) suitable cells including various stem cells or primary cells that effectively replace the damaged tissues without adverse consequences. Yet many challenges must be overcome such as scaffold choice, cell source and immunological barriers. Today, hepatogenic differentiation of stem cells has <b>created</b> <b>trust</b> and promise for use of these cells in hepatic tissue engineering and liver replacement. However, using suitable scaffolds is an important key to achieving the necessary functions required for hepatic replacement. In recent years, different scaffolds have been used for liver tissue engineering.

The value of platforms for innovation is widely recognized, but more understanding is needed of the choices made in facilitation, to enable platforms to perform effectively within varying value chain contexts. This paper applies a comparative case study analysis of four innovation platforms in West Africa that aim to create institutional change {{for the benefit of}} smallholders. Each institutional context (emerging or developing value chain, a well-established value chain with more or less distortion by politics and rent-seeking behaviour) constituted a specific type of constraint and required different facilitation choices. Comparison showed that it is imperative for facilitators to have a clear platform purpose and design criteria, and good situation and actor analyses, and to interactively design small platforms, fit to create institutional change in a given context. Platforms need actors with capacities relating to the issue at stake, but also communicative qualities. Then there are situational facilitation choices: local level platforms need more structuring of deliberation, data-gathering, networking, and advocacy than higher level platforms. However, what emerged as essential for all was delicate mediation and dynamic agenda-setting. This <b>created</b> <b>trust,</b> relationships, and momentum for mutually supportive team action and institutional change...|$|E

Introducing the information technology should offer the possibility by which reform processes of the government should become more efficient, transparent and much more public for the citizens; in this way, their ability of participating directly to government activities should prove the carrying out of a democratic and free frame. One of the essential issues of such phenomenon is that of proving that adopting the information and communication technology programs to government process or electronic government depends upon a series of external factors, such {{as the level of}} state's development, the cultural level, the frame of developing the structures of central and local public authority, criteria that differentiate the applicability of such system, to various countries. This difference is especially seen as comparing to the East states of European Union.

40|$|Fire {{departments}} in the United States accounted for 31 % of municipal budgets with increases of 85 % spending between 2015 and 2016. The purpose of this single case {{study was to explore}} leadership strategies fire officers used to manage costs associated with hazardous operations. The conceptual framework grounding this study was transformational leadership theory. The {{participants in this study were}} 10 fire officers who manage hazardous operations in central Wisconsin. The data collection process included open-ended questions in a semistructured format resulting in transcripts, a review of fire department staffing documents, and personal journal notes. Methodological triangulation was used to compare the collected data and verified through member checking for accuracy. Upon completion of data collection, the data analysis process consisted of transcripts involving coding, grouping key words, and reconstructing data into themes. Four central themes emerged from the study: servant leadership, partnership, accountability, and creative staffing. The fire officers used servant leadership to ensure the provisions of services to internal and external customers. The servant leadership practice <b>created</b> <b>trust</b> and integrity. Creative staffing provided innovative cost management and fiscal responsibility to include partnership. Partnership and accountability worked in every facet of the fire department soliciting input from every level of staff. Fire officers in the study practiced transformational leadership daily in both emergency and nonemergency situations. Social implications include innovative leadership strategies and application that may help fire officers promote positive social change through saving lives of firefighters and the citizens they serve...|$|E

An increasing number of projects aim to use sport as a tool for improving, for instance, social, cultural and educational conditions in marginalised or disadvantaged communities. However, in the literature, there are limited empirical examinations that take the perspective of the recipients. Therefore, in an attempt to understand how a SDP programme is experienced from the perspective of local community members one particular SDP intervention in a South African community is examined. The study applies a qualitative research structure inspired by person-centred ethnography. I combined participant observations, semi-structured interviews and document analyses to explore this perspective. In doing this the study doesn’t ask if SDP works, but rather how it works, and how it is experienced by community members who have participated in the program and those who have not.

40|$|Abstract Background: Type 1 {{diabetes}} is a chronic disease that worldwide greatly increases among children and adolescents. Major demands are required {{from the individual}} who has this disease, which also requires significant knowledge from the nurses {{so they can be}} able to develop and create individual conditions for children and adolescents. Thus, the children and the adolescents can be able to take responsibility and feel secure in their own care. The nurse's techniques and specific tools in this work are however not particularly noteworthy and therefore needs to be advised. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the experiences nurses have of supporting adolescents, between 12 - 18 years, with type 1 diabetes to an increased understanding of the disease and also to examine the methodological aspect data collection in the articles of this study. Method: A descriptive, literature study according to Polit and Beck (2012). 14 scientific articles have been produced from the databases PubMed and Cinahl, which can be accessed through the University of Gävle servers for scientific databases. Main results: Nurses have experienced that it is important to include teamwork with the adolescents with type 1 diabetes. The importance of parents' continued commitments were also highlighted. It could be difficult to get feedback from the young people and therefore it was important that the nurse <b>created</b> <b>trust</b> and in an educational way could instruct young people to dare to take full responsibility over their own care. Many nurses also highlighted the importance of working with the best available scientific evidence in order to educate and disseminate facts about the disease. Conclusion: Responsiveness, flexibility and support were key concepts in the nurse's work with children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Nurses can not only work according to strictly established guidelines. Generally, nurses felt an uncertainty in the responsibility in the care of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. This is established on the basis that nurses felt that they did not have sufficient knowledge to provide optimal care for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. ...|$|E

40|$|Information-dependency {{is one of}} the key {{dependencies}} between cooperating {{public entities}} and is of primordial importance for effective and efficient functioning. An information-flow between organisations depends to some extent on relational dimensions, such as interorganisational trust. Within this paper three types of information-sharing between public organisations are distinguished and the role of trust within each of these types is explored. Interviews were conducted with members of different entities of the Flemish juvenile justice chain. The findings suggest that formal information requires the least amount of trust to flow but has also little power to <b>create</b> <b>trust.</b> Informal information, although equally determinant for the decision-making process, requires more interorganisational trust to flow and also has more power to <b>create</b> <b>trusting</b> ties.
