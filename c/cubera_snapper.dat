50|$|Pelagic {{game fish}} are {{abundant}} because the continental shelf drops sharply relatively close to shore, with year-round catch including amberjack, Pacific sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus), <b>cubera</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus cyanopterus), roosterfish (Nematistius pectoralis) and grouper, while dorado (Coryphaena hippurus, commonly called mahi-mahi, or dolphinfish), both bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), and wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri) are found seasonally, November through April.|$|E
50|$|The {{archipelago}} is {{a popular}} destination for diving and fishing. It {{used to be one}} of Fidel Castro's favorite fishing spots. Species of fish found here include <b>Cubera</b> <b>snapper,</b> Bonefish, Yellowfin grouper, Black grouper, Atlantic goliath grouper as well as Strombus gigas (the large Caribbean conch) and Whale shark.Besides being an extraordinary site for fly fishing, one its main attractions for diving is the abundance of reef sharks.|$|E
50|$|There are two wrecked ships on {{the west}} side.The waters are very clear, with {{visibility}} up to 40 m, and are often used by amateur fishers and divers.There are various species including groupers, gray parrotfish (Sparisoma axillare) and <b>Cubera</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus cyanopterus).Larger fish are found on the Parcel de Fora to the south at depths from 3 to 30 m.Over-fishing is a problem, and creation of a national marine park around the island has been proposed for several years.|$|E
50|$|Snappers inhabit {{tropical}} and subtropical {{regions of}} all oceans. Some snappers {{grow up to}} about 1 m in length however one specific Snapper, the <b>Cubera</b> <b>Snapper,</b> grows up to 5 ft in length. Most are active carnivores, feeding on crustaceans or other fish, though a few are plankton-feeders. They can be kept in aquaria, but mostly grow too fast to be popular aquarium fish. Most species live at depths reaching 100 m near coral reefs, but some species are found up to 500 m deep.|$|E
50|$|The Sanctuary has {{a diverse}} array of species {{including}} fish, mammal, reptile and bird population. There are 26 species of international concern within the Sanctuary and the 66-foot buffer vegetation {{on the edge of}} the lagoon. The water opossum, Yucatán howler monkey, Morlet's crocodile, American salt water crocodile, Baird's tapir, Neotropical river otter, cownose ray and the <b>Cubera</b> <b>snapper</b> can be found within or around the sanctuary. They are also 330 species of birds, including the yellow-headed parrot, the great curassow, and the jabiru stork can be seen. Several other species can be found just outside the protected are such as the jaguar, puma, margay, ocelot, jaguarundi and the Central American spider monkey.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cubera</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus cyanopterus) is {{a species}} of snapper native to the western Atlantic Ocean from Nova Scotia to the Amazon River in Brazil, though it is rare north of Florida. It {{can also be found}} in the Caribbean Sea and, rarely, in the Gulf of Mexico. It inhabits areas {{associated}} with reefs, preferring areas with rocky substrates, and feeds on ray-finned fishes, shrimp and crabs. It can be found at depths from 18 to 55 m. This species can reach a length of 160 cm, though most do not exceed 90 cm. The greatest recorded weight for a specimen of this species is 57 kg. It is commercially important and is also sought-after as a game fish, though it has been reported to cause ciguatera poisoning.|$|E
50|$|The {{mangrove}} snapper can {{be confused}} with the <b>Cubera</b> <b>snapper</b> or black snapper, Lutjanus cyanopterus. Mangrove snapper are typically much smaller than Cubera, but when they are of similar size, the two species can only be distinguished by examining the tooth patch on the inside roof of the mouth. Many specimens caught in Florida, specifically Punta Gorda, are actually misidentified dogtooth or dog snapper, Lutjanus jocu. The best way to distinguish between the two species is dog snapper has a lighter triangle of color with a blue band under the eye and large, sharp fangs in the front (canines), hence its common name. These fangs can deliver a painful bite, even in a small fish. The mangrove snapper feeds mostly on small fishes and crustaceans. It was also observed as systematically waiting under maternal colony of Buffy flower bat for falling bats near the entrances of Lucayan cavern, Bahamas.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cubera</b> <b>snapper</b> Lutjanus cyanopterus {{aggregated}} {{to spawn}} at Gladden Spit, a salient sub-surface reef promontory seaward of the emergent reef {{and near the}} continental shelf edge of Belize. Their spawning aggregations typically formed 2 days before to 12 days after full moon from March to September 1998 — 2003 within a 45 000 m 2 reef area. Peak abundance of 4000 to 10 000 individuals was observed between April and July each year, while actual spawning was most frequently observed in May. Spawning was observed consistently from 40 min before to 10 min after sunset within a confined area 1000 m 2. Data suggested that <b>cubera</b> <b>snapper</b> consistently formed seasonal spawning aggregations in relation to location, photoperiod, water temperature and lunar cycle, and that spawning was cued by time of day but not tides. The <b>cubera</b> <b>snapper</b> aggregation site was included within the Gladden Spit Marine Reserve, a conditional no-take fishing zone. # 2005 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles Key words: lutjanids; marine reserves; predation; spawning aggregation...|$|E
40|$|The larvae and newly-settled juveniles of the <b>Cubera</b> <b>Snapper,</b> Lutjanus cyanopterus, are {{identified}} by DNA barcoding. Four larvae and three small juveniles of L. cyanopterus were detected among a large collection of pelagic larvae {{and a smaller}} collection of settled juveniles from the Caribbean coast of Panama. The mtDNA COI barcode sequences from the larvae and juveniles were virtually identical to sequences from adults sampled from the spawning aggregation in St. Thomas, USVI. Barcode sequences for the eleven regional species of Lutjanus species (sensu lato) were obtained and they exhibited deep interspecific divergences that allowed for efficient discrimination among the western Atlantic snapper species. The nearest neighbor species, the Mutton Snapper L. analis, was more than 11 % divergent from L. cyanopterus. <b>Cubera</b> <b>Snapper</b> larvae are characterized by prominent melanophores along the outer spinous-dorsal-fin membranes and along the outer third of the longer pelvic-fin membranes. They are morphologically distinct from the late-stage larvae of the other regional snappers by their relatively wider caudal peduncle and their relative dorsal-spine lengths.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{was developed}} for converting the activity concentration of radionuclides (Bq kg- 1) into absorbed dose rate (Gy y- 1), aiming an approach to environmental radioprotection based {{on the concept of}} standard dose limit. The model considers only the internal absorbed dose rate. This methodology was applied to the <b>cubera</b> <b>snapper</b> fish (Lutjanus cyanopterus, Cuvier, 1828) caught off the coast of Ceará. The natural radionuclides considered were uranium- 238, radium- 226, lead- 210, thorium- 232 and radium- 228. The absorbed dose rates were calculated for individual radionuclides and the type of emitted radiation. The average dose rate due to these radionuclides was 5. 36 µGy y- 1, a value six orders of magnitude smaller than the threshold value of absorbed dose rate used in this study (3. 65 10 ³ mGy y- 1), and similar to that found in the literature for benthic fish. Ra- 226 and U- 238 contributed 67 % and 22 % of the absorbed dose rate, followed by Th- 232 with 10 %. Ra- 228 and Pb- 210, in turn, accounted for less than 1 % of the absorbed dose rate.

40|$|Most large reef fish use a migratory {{reproductive}} {{strategy and}} tend to spawn in aggregations that occur at predictable locations and times. Though numerous hypotheses have been formulated to explain the reasons behind this phenomenon, there remain few data to evaluate {{the relative merits of}} various hypotheses. Oceanographic variables and lunar cycles are believed to drive the timing and location of this reproductive strategy. However, the dynamics of the interaction between coastal currents, water temperature, biomass concentrations, spawning site selection and gamete transport are still unclear. This study aimed to examine the influence that currents exert on gametes released at spawning aggregations of <b>Cubera</b> <b>snapper</b> Lutjanus cyanopterus (Cuvier, 1828) at Gladden Spit, Belize. It was hypothesized that surface currents flowed offshore at the time and location of spawning. However, observations from this study, using Lagrangian and Eulerian methods, indicated that eggs most likely travel westerly towards the reef and into the reef channel. The dispersal rate of eggs appeared to be explained by a power relationship, with buoyant fertilized eggs dispersing horizontally such that the area of the spawning cloud increased with time. Egg density within the spawning cloud generally decreased over time as it dispersed with the predominant surface currents. Most importantly low-cost surface drifters area an appropriate, highly replicable way to monitor surface ocean currents at spawning sides in areas where more sophisticated methods are not available. Understanding how abiotic factors influence the occurrence of multispecies spawning aggregations will lead to better conservation and management strategies in the Western Caribbean...|$|E

Visando a radioproteção ambiental, baseada no conceito de limite de taxa de dose absorvida, foi desenvolvida uma metodologia de conversão da concentração de atividade de radionuclídeos (Bq kg- 1) em taxa de dose absorvida (Gy a- 1). O modelo considera apenas a taxa de dose absorvida interna. Essa metodologia foi aplicada ao peixe vermelho-caranho (Lutjanus cyanopterus, Cuvier, 1828) capturado na costa do Ceará e aos radionuclídeos naturais: urânio- 238, rádio- 226, chumbo- 210, tório- 232 e rádio- 228. As taxas de dose absorvidas foram calculadas por radionuclídeo e por tipo de radiação emitida. A taxa de dose média devida a esses radionuclídeos foi de 5. 36 µGy a- 1, valor seis ordens de grandeza menor que o valor de limite de taxa de dose absorvida utilizada no presente trabalho (3. 65 10 ³ mGy a- 1), e similar ao encontrado na literatura para peixes bentônicos.
