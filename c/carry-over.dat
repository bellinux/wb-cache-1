Meanwhile, Commander T'Pol, having {{lost contact with}} the team, attempts to destroy the station, but the Klingon ship intervenes. Malik uses Phlox's friendship to finally coerce the security codes from Lucas (by threatening to expose him to a pathogen as well). Soong, who had previously stolen 19 genetically enhanced and frozen embryos from C-12, is now able to access the remaining 1,800, a <b>carry-over</b> from the Eugenics Wars.

5|$|To {{address the}} {{relatively}} poor {{reception of the}} preceding AU series, the BA series was heavily updated for launch in September 2002—the same time as its biggest rival, the Holden Commodore (VY). It featured a substantially revised and more conservative exterior styling, with every panel new except for the <b>carry-over</b> door skins. Interiors, too, were substantially revised, while mechanically, a new independent rear suspension setup was fitted to all sedan derivatives and the engine and transmissions received extensive upgrades. In October 2004, Ford introduced a Mark II update, bringing subtle styling and mechanical changes, and in October 2005, replaced the BA with the BF.|$|E

500|$|The VN Commodore of 1988 and {{subsequent}} second generation models took their bodywork {{from the larger}} Opel Senator B and new Opel Omega A. However, this time, the floor plan was widened and stretched; now matching the rival Ford Falcon for size. Continuing financial woes at Holden meant the wider VN body was underpinned by narrow, <b>carry-over</b> VL chassis components {{in a bid to}} save development costs. In the VN and succeeding models, the Commodore Berlina became known simply as the Berlina. The range expanded in 1990 to include a utility variant, given the model designation VG. This was built on a longer-wheelbase platform that it shared with the station wagon and luxury VQ Statesman sedans released earlier in the year. During this time, the rival Ford EA Falcon was plagued with initial quality issues which tarnished its reputation. Buyers embraced the VN Commodore, helping Holden to recover and post an operating profit of [...] for 1989. The team at Wheels magazine awarded the VN Car of the Year in 1988: the second Commodore model to receive this award.|$|E
500|$|USA Today praised Laurie's {{performance}} and the repercussions of the season-four finale, stating [...] "a <b>carry-over</b> from last season's brilliant finale, House is firmly in the forefront. And {{when you have an}} actor of Hugh Laurie's range, depth and charisma, putting him center-stage makes perfect sense, particularly when you've written a story that explores the character and his primary relationships in a way that seems". The New York Daily News noted that [...] "The show pays more attention to relationships we care about, hints at a sensible number of new ones that show some promise, and thus doesn't rely on obscure medical mysteries to carry the whole dramatic burden", and noted that [...] "the prognosis for this season could be better than last season seemed to foreshadow". Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times highlighted the performances of the cast, especially Michael Weston as detective Lucas Douglas, calling him a [...] "delightful addition". She concluded, [...] "So different is the premiere that the savvy House (and Fox) viewer may expect the revelation that it was all a fever dream. That {{does not seem to be}} the case, and one assumes that Laurie and the writers will be bringing a different version of their now-iconic character back to Princeton. Not too different, of course, but different enough." [...] Conversely, The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan disliked Weston's character, calling him [...] "An unwelcome distraction... an irritating pipsqueak". She continued saying [...] "House used to be one of the best shows on TV, but it's gone seriously off the rails". The Sunday Times felt that the show had [...] "lost its sense of humour". The focus on Thirteen and her eventual involvement with Foreman also came under particular criticism.|$|E

All subjects participated in both alcohol consumption and sleep deprivation, and the order of testing was counterbalanced so that half of the subjects participated in the alcohol consumption part first while the other half participated in the sleep deprivation part first. To avoid <b>carry-over</b> effects from one condition to the next, subjects were provided with a night of rest in a motel between each condition.|$|E
2500|$|Trimmings varied {{according}} to the changing styles and whims of the individual wearer, but most bonnets of the period followed some general rules with regards to form. Rows of gathered net lining the brim was a fashion <b>carry-over</b> from the decade before, and a decorative curtain (also {{referred to as a}} [...] "bavolet") appeared on most bonnets in order to shade the wearer's neck and accommodate for the low hairstyles. Another standard of 1860s bonnets is bonnet ties. There were often two sets, a thin pair of [...] "utility ties" [...] to take the strain of tying the bonnet, and another set of wide ties of silk or another fancy material. These rich ties were tied below the chin in a bow or left untied to show off the beautiful print or material.|$|E
2500|$|The fall of Rangoon cut off {{the routine}} import of Burmese rice into India and Ceylon. [...] In India, {{according}} to the Famine Commission's, Final Report, [...] "the areas most affected were parts of the provinces of Bombay and Madras and the States of Cochin and Travancore." [...] The imports from Burma normally met India's supply deficit in rice, which totaled 1,750,000 tons. In Bengal, the net import for which actual receipts and despatch documents existed, was on average 50,000 tons annually for 1932–1937, [...] and 159,000 tons annually for 1938–42, the highest levels being recorded for the years 1934 and 1939 at 364,000 tons and 382,000 tons respectively. [...] But, according to the Final Report, there was also unrecorded import into Bengal [...] "by country boat from Assam and from Arakan in Burma" [...] the extent of which was not known accurately. [...] The Commission proposed that this import was {{of the order of}} 50,000 tons annually for 1932–1937 and 100,000 tons annually for 1938–1942. [...] Aggregate consumption was also computed, not by a direct approach using census-based population statistics whose margin of error was too high, but by indirect estimation from a combination of the available values of annual supply, net import, <b>carry-over</b> stock at the year's beginning, and the same at the year's end. [...] However, as <b>carry-over</b> stock in any individual year could not be accurately estimated, averages were computed for a longer periods under the expectation that the <b>carry-over</b> stock at {{the beginning and the end}} of the periods were negligible compared to the total consumption during the periods. [...] The commission also made adjustments in annual supply, which had errors stemming from the assessment of cultivated acreage under the permanent settlement in Bengal. In this way, average consumption for the 15-year period 1928 to 1942 was computed to be 8.14 million tons annually for unadjusted acreage, and 9.18 million tons for the adjusted. Annual consumption was then estimated by assuming that it veered off the unadjusted average by increments, or decrements, of 0.10 million tons every year, and off the adjusted average by those of 0.12 million tons. [...] Using these data in the Famine Inquiry Commission report, the percentage of net imports—either recorded only, or both recorded and unrecorded, computed relative to a 15-year- or 5-year time period, and to consumption- or supply averages, which were either unadjusted or adjusted—were found by scholars to be 1.1% and 1.4% in one instance, and [...] "less than 4%" [...] in another. Using different data, P. C. Mahalanobis estimated the net imports to be on average 1% of aggregate supply for the period 1934–39, estimating their highest value for a single year at 5% for 1934, and noting that [...] "the physical quantities of net imports was never large." [...] While acknowledging that the influx of Burma rice was a factor in stabilizing prices, as it prevented hoarding or cornering the market, he concluded that there was [...] "chronic but a growing shortage of rice in Bengal," [...] which had not affected prices or imports because a large number of people, lacking the money to buy enough food, often made do with less than what was enough.|$|E
2500|$|Brunel {{made two}} {{controversial}} decisions: {{to use a}} broad gauge of [...] for the track, which he believed would offer superior running at high speeds; and to take a route that passed north of the Marlborough Downs—an area with no significant towns, though it offered potential connections to Oxford and Gloucester—and then to follow the Thames Valley into London. His decision to use broad gauge for the line was controversial in that almost all British railways to date had used standard gauge. Brunel {{said that this was}} nothing more than a <b>carry-over</b> from the mine railways that George Stephenson had worked on prior to making the world's first passenger railway. Brunel proved through both calculation and a series of trials that his broader gauge was the optimum size for providing both higher speeds and a stable and comfortable ride to passengers. In addition the wider gauge allowed for larger carriages and thus greater freight capacity.|$|E
2500|$|Priority date – {{the visa}} becomes {{available}} when the applicant's priority date is {{earlier than the}} cutoff date announced on the DOS's Visa Bulletin or when the immigrant visa category the applicant is assigned to is announced as [...] "current". [...] A [...] "current" [...] designation indicates that visa numbers are available to all applicants in the corresponding immigrant category. Petitions with priority dates earlier than the cutoff date {{are expected to have}} visas available, therefore those applicants are eligible for final adjudication. When the NVC determines that a visa number could be available for a particular immigrant petition, a visa is tentatively allocated to the applicant. The NVC will send a letter stating that the applicant may be eligible for adjustment of status, and requiring the applicant to choose either to adjust status with the USCIS directly, or apply at the U.S. consulate abroad. This waiting process determines when the applicant can expect the immigration case to be adjudicated. Due to quotas imposed on EB visa categories, there are more approved immigrant petitions than visas available under INA. High demand for visas has created a backlog of approved but unadjudicated cases. In addition, due to processing inefficiencies throughout DOS and USCIS systems, not all visas available under the quota system in a given year were allocated to applicants by the DOS. Since there is no quota <b>carry-over</b> to the next fiscal year, for several years visa quotas have not been fully used, thus adding to the visa backlog.|$|E

Entry-level customers were offered the <b>carry-over</b> [...] "Ci" [...] 1.8-liter 1S-i (designated 1S-iLU in the V10) inline-four with five-speed manual or an automatic with four gears. Stepping up from {{this were the}} new 3S-FE and GT high-performance 3S-GE (designated 3S-GELU for V10s) 2.0-liter twin-cam four-cylinder cars. Turbo-diesel models were again limited to the 2C-T motor displacing 2.0liters (labeled 2C-TL for V10s). Transmission were either a five-speed manual or an electronically controlled automatic with four gears. When launched in Japan, the V20 series Camry (sedan only) offered the following trim levels: LT, XT, XT Saloon, ZE, ZT, ZX, and GT. For the Vista sedan, Toyota offered: VC, VL, VE, VR, and VX. Hardtop versions comprised: VE, VR, VX, and GT. Flagship models of the Japanese specification Camry sedan, the Camry Prominent and Prominent G arrived in April 1987 with the 2.0-liter 1VZ-FE V6 engine, a protruding chrome grille, larger North American-type bumpers, wood grain interior highlights, an electric seat function, plus electronic instrument cluster. Full-time four-wheel-drive became an option in October 1987 with select 3S-FE manual variants (VL Extra, VR); automatics equipped with an electronic front- and rear-wheel torque distribution optimizer followed in August 1988. The Vista was not available with the V6, but in April 1987, the special edition Vista VL Extra sedan and hardtop arrived, followed by the Etoile in August and again in January 1989; limited edition Etoile V cars were offered in September 1989 and January 1990. Toyota discontinued the Vista VC in December 1989 and released a special edition VX Limited in May 1989 and then again for January 1990. When the Camry Prominent hardtop variant arrived in August 1988, it offered base, G, and E-Type levels of trim alongside a new sedan-only Camry Lumière. Also in August 1988, a diesel version of the Vista hardtop made its debut, and the 1.8-liter gasoline engine was upgraded to the twin-cam 4S-Fi specification. Special editions for the Camry comprised: Lumière S sedan (January 1989), Prominent X hardtop (May 1989), Lumière G sedan (June 1989), and XT Saloon Special sedan (January 1990).
