Therefore, socio-ecological system (SES) is needed to respond changes so that robust management could be created. Research on SES was focused more on capacity of governance in creating management of conservation area, particularly in the period where there were occurrence of resistance between social problem and ecosystem. Principal component analysis explained 76 % of the total variability. Very high variable respond category occurred on first principal component (PC) with positive effect which was related directly to ecological condition, and negative effect toward <b>catch</b> <b>yield</b> and utilization of traditional zone. Condition of economy and fish resources contributed positively toward second PC, and can be expressed as factor which affected economic condition of fishermen household. Condition of fishermen, related with catching activity and income of fishermen household gave positive effect toward the third PC, and can be expressed as component which affected catching effort and explained exploitation level by fishermen toward resources. Interaction between factors which formed SES occurred due to economic activity of fishermen household, catching efforts, and ecological capacity. Design of governance could be conducted on increase of fishermen household economy through control of catching efforts and considering the carrying capacity and ecological capacity.

The study shows that between the years 2000 – 2015 the crustacean fishery increased (pooling both shrimp and crabs) with fluctuations from 40 % to 63 % of the total production of the lagoon. The crab yield, during this period, increased from 19 % to 42 % of the total lagoon production. Moreover, {{the results show that}} the crab catch of BL is composed mainly of two crab species Portunus pelagicus (L.) and C. sapidus (Rath.). The latter is considered the most dominant in the crab yield with 85 % of the total crab production, while C. sapidus is only 15 %. The size of C. sapidus ranged between 65 and 155 mm (carapace width) with a dominance of the class size 105 mm. Furthermore, the ratio of C. sapidus males to females was in favor of males. The regression of width–length relationship showed a marked deviation from the isometric growth. Length–width and body weight regressions also showed deviations from the isometric growth and the analysis of the covariance. This indicates the significant difference between sexes in respect to length weight relationship. The interrelationships between width–length and propodus length and depth of males and with abdomen in females of C. sapidus suggested that in most conditions the relationships were positive and highly significant. This study shows the first insights on the status of C. sapidus in Bardawil Lagoon, Egypt...|$|E

Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. The most known Lake Victoria dagaa fishery (Rastrioneobola argentae) in Eastern and Southern {{countries}} of Sub-Saharan African region consists characterized by physical, quality and economical (PQE) losses along the supply chain. The survey {{was done on}} the PQE losses on Sun dried dagaa along the supply chain. Losses are at fishing, processing under sun drying on bare open beach sand and during consumers' preparation. During sun drying in open sand, birds and animals find an opportunity to eat. If it rains {{then there is a}} total physical loss. Similarly economical loss is in parallel due to poor raw dagaa and sand processed dagaa products which lead to low price of dagaa. The price of dagaa is dependent on {{the quantity and quality of}} the dagaa <b>catch</b> <b>yield.</b> Dagaa again suffers with a huge loss about 1 / 3 of total weight of dagaa during preparation for cooking at street restaurants and households. The heads and bellies of dagaa are removed on believes that heads contain sand and the bellies cause the bitter taste of dagaa.   The consumer encounters loss in quantity, nutrients and economical losses due the sand, heads and bellies parts being removed and thrown away during preparation.   PQE losses are costing all the stakeholders in the supply chain, the fishers, traders, Government and consumers. The dagaa business is not formally regulated; very few traders may declare exports. Hence the government is losing a lot of revenue as there is limited control of records on processed and exported dagaa products. ...|$|E

40|$|Aims: To support {{community-based}} {{fisheries management}} (CBFM) of inland fisheries resources in Bangladesh. Study Design: An {{investigation into the}} impact of the nationwide CBFM Project and four alternative yield-effort models were fitted to the <b>catch</b> (<b>yield)</b> and effort data. Place and Duration of Study: The study comprised community managed fisheries (sites) located in five different inland water habitat types in Bangladesh for the period 1997 - 2005. Methodology: Using data compiled for this impact assessment, the aggregated yield-effort response is examined in more detail among different habitats as a means of providing local managers with guidance on controlling fishing effort. Results: An effort-based analogue of the ad hoc ‘F 0. 1 strategy’ E 0. x is proposed as a management reference point to be used with this model. Estimates of fishing effort at x= 1 and 2 and corresponding yield () and catch rates () are also provided for the five habitats examined. Values for x of between 1 and 2 give rise to a CPUE of approximately 40 - 50 % of the predicted maximum CPUE. Catch rates may be used to monitor progress towards the selected reference point. As a general ‘rule of thumb’ for the fisheries examined, catch per fisher, averaged over the year, corresponding to the reference point is approximately 0. 5 kg d- 1 when x= 1 and 0. 7 kg d- 1 when x= 2. The asymptotic model provided the best description of the yield-effort response for floodplain and Haor beel habitats and the sigmoid model provided best description of the data for the Open beel and River habitats. The Schaefer model provided the best description of the data for closed beel habitat. However, among all habitats the Fox model was the least favoured model. Conclusion: Both the asymptotic and the sigmoid model each provided the best description of the yield-effort response within two habitats. The Schaefer model provided the best description of the data for closed beel habitat. The study has provided evidence that across habitat favoured an asymptotic yield-effort model (Akaike weight 0. 85) as being the most generally applicable...|$|E
40|$|Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is a {{demersal}} fish found across the North Atlantic Ocean {{in a variety}} of habitats from the shoreline to the continental shelf slope. Throughout its range of distribution, cod experience a great variety of biotic and abiotic conditions, particularly in relation to thermal and feeding regimes. Such variations affect life history characteristics such as growth, physiological condition, distribution and migration patterns at a variety of scales including decadal, annual and seasonal. In this study I investigate how these processes vary on a seasonal scale level and affect fisheries, stock assessment and management of cod from Placentia Bay, Newfoundland (Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization Subdivision 3 Ps). The results of this study show that cod have marked seasonal variability in traits such as weight, physiological condition, growth, distribution and aggregations patterns, in addition to the commercial yield and quality of fish products. These changes were related to changes in thermal and feeding regimes through the year, in addition to spawning, migration and intermixing of cod from different geographic regions. Cod ages 4 - 9 experienced a rapid increase in weight and condition during late spring and summer when capelin (Mallotus villosus) comprised {{an important component of the}} diet, despite of cold water temperatures and moderate to high spawning activity and peaked in the fall. Seasonal variations of biological cycles, distribution and mixing of different groups of cod resulted in large within-year variations in stock abundance, age and size composition, impacted fishing levels and harvest rates of putative stock components and affected precision of abundance index estimates. Simulation results suggest that stock performance and productivity are impacted by the way fishing mortality is distributed across age groups and that stock growth and <b>catch</b> <b>yield</b> are driven by the survival of younger fish and by allowing age diversity in the stock, which appears to facilitate good recruitment, particularly when abundance is high. The simulations show that a weight-based fishery in the fall when cod are heavier and in good physiological condition would harvest fewer fish and result in better yield and product quality. However, a fall fishery would concentrate exploitation on the resident component of the stock. The largest sustainable catches were observed in summer when the most abundant non-resident fish are found in the bay. Overall, the results and conclusions of this thesis suggest that seasonal biological patterns in cod may be used to develop fishing and management strategies that minimize the impact of harvesting on productivity while optimizing economic benefits and conservation of stock components. The results from this study are likely relevant to other cod stocks and perhaps to other species (e. g., invertebrates, marine mammals) as seasonality is a common feature of reproduction and growth of many temperate and high latitude aquatic species, which are normally synchronised with periods when organisms benefit from favourable thermal conditions and high forage status...|$|E
40|$|Often {{the scale}} of {{production}} of many industrial fisheries in the world shows rigidity vis à vis declines in fish abundance, which on occasions has generated fishing collapse. This paper studies the two fisheries with the greatest volume of landings in Chile, and which are also characterized by strong variability in their abundance. Production-side aspects that affect the incentives to adjust towards lower fishing efforts are analyzed. To do so, production functions for industrial fleets at each fishery are estimated by resorting to panel data. Two main results are obtained. First, we confirm the empirical relevance of Translog harvest technologies.

As in spring–early summer 20 to 30 % of catch biomass consists of individuals smaller than MLS (TL = 20 cm), the selectivity of sole gill nets was investigated in 2004 - 2005 {{in order to obtain}} useful information for developing management measures aimed at reducing the retention of undersized specimens and assuring the sustainability of this fishery. Twenty-eight fishing trips were performed using sole gill nets with 5 mesh openings (64. 2, 65. 2, 67. 8, 70. 2 and 71. 8 mm) simultaneously. The gill net selectivity was estimated indirectly by applying the SELECT method and between-set analysis. The log-normal curve was found to fit single set data better than other models. The <b>catch</b> <b>yields</b> did not significantly decrease with the increment of mesh size: the biomass of undersized individuals in catches noticeably decreased from 16 % down to 9 % in the largest mesh size, whilst the sole that were longer than the MLS increased proportionally.

40|$|International audienceMarine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) are implemented worldwide as an efficient tool to preserve biodiversity and protect ecosystems. We used food web models (Ecopath and EcoTroph) {{to assess the}} ability of MPAs to reduce fishing impacts on targeted resources and to provide biomass exports for adjacent fisheries. Three coastal MPAs: Bonifacio and Port-Cros (Mediterranean Sea), and Bamboung (Senegalese coast), were used as case studies. Pre-existing related Ecopath models were homogenized and ecosystem characteristics were compared based on network indices and trophic spectra analyses. Using the EcoTroph model, we simulated different fishing mortality scenarios and assessed fishing impacts on the three ecosystems. Lastly, the potential biomass that could be exported from each MPA was estimated. Despite structural and functional trophic differences, the three MPAs showed similar patterns of resistance to simulated fishing mortalities, with the Bonifacio case study exhibiting the highest potential catches and a slightly inferior resistance to fishing. We also show that the potential exports from our small size MPAs are limited and thus may only benefit local fishing activities. Based on simulations, their potential exports were estimated {{to be at the}} same order of magnitude as the amount of catch that could have been obtained inside the reserve. In Port Cros, the ban of fishing inside MPA could actually allow for improved <b>catch</b> <b>yields</b> outside the MPA due to biomass exports. This was not the case for the Bonifacio site, as its potential exports were too low to offset catch losses. This insight suggests the need for MPA networks and/or sufficiently large MPAs to effectively protect juveniles and adults and provide important exports. Finally, we discuss the effects of MPAs on fisheries that were not considered in food web models, and conclude by suggesting possible improvements in the analysis of MPA efficienc...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Malaria parasites (Plasmodium sp.), {{including}} new species, {{have recently been}} discovered as low grade mixed infections in three wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) sampled randomly in Kibale National Park, Uganda. This suggested a high prevalence of malaria infection in this community. The clinical course of malaria in chimpanzees and the species of the vectors that transmit their parasites are not known. The fact that these apes display a specific behaviour in which they consume plant parts of low nutritional value but that contain compounds with anti-malarial properties suggests that the apes health might {{be affected by the}} parasite. The avoidance of the night-biting anopheline mosquitoes is another potential behavioural adaptation that would lead to a {{decrease in the number of}} infectious bites and consequently malaria. METHODS: Mosquitoes were collected over two years using suction-light traps and yeast-generated CO(2) traps at the nesting and the feeding sites of two chimpanzee communities in Kibale National Park. The species of the female Anopheles caught were then determined and the presence of Plasmodium was sought in these insects by PCR amplification. RESULTS: The mosquito <b>catches</b> <b>yielded</b> a total of 309 female Anopheles specimens, the only known vectors of malaria parasites of mammalians. These specimens belonged to 10 species, of which Anopheles implexus, Anopheles vinckei and Anopheles demeilloni dominated. Sensitive DNA amplification techniques failed to detect any Plasmodium-positive Anopheles specimens. Humidity and trap height influenced the Anopheles capture success, and there was a negative correlation between nest numbers and mosquito abundance. The anopheline mosquitoes were also less diverse and numerous in sites where chimpanzees were nesting as compared to those where they were feeding. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that the sites where chimpanzees build their nests every night might be selected, at least in part, in order to minimize contact with anopheline mosquitoes, which might lead to a reduced risk in acquiring malaria infections...|$|R

40|$|This {{industry}} {{guidance note}} explains {{the concept of}} MSY, how it applies to individual fish stocks and the ICES approach. What is Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) ? Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) describes the largest average <b>catch</b> or <b>yield</b> that can continuously be taken from a stock under existing environmental conditions. Fishing at MSY levels means catching the maximum proportion of a fish stock, that can safely {{be removed from the}} stock while, at the same time, maintaining its capacity to produce sustainable returns, in the long term. In the case of a small stock, the annual yield potential is limited because there are too few adult fish producing too few young fish that can contribute to the renewal of the stock concerned. At the same time, when a fish stock is too large, the annual reproduction is low and growth slows down due to lack of food and the production of younger fish may decrease due to competition between them. Between these extremes is a stock size at which the sustainable catch is at the highest practicable level. This is the stock size that can produce the maximum sustainable yield...|$|R

Fishing rods with baited hooks and fishing lines used in various ways are used for fishing for some particular types of fish. Fishing using nets like cast nets, hand nets, drift nets, gillnets, seine nets, trawl nets, surrounding nets etc. of various sizes and construction as well as longline fishing with hundreds of hooks on a line fishing both for bottom and pelagic fish (near surface fish) are the most common devices used to <b>catch</b> high <b>yields</b> of fish. The crab fisheries uses crab pots baited with dead fish to catch crabs.In some parts of the Pacific Northwest, fishing with baited traps is also common. Common commercial methods for catching shrimp and prawns include bottom trawling, cast nets, seines, shrimp baiting and dip netting. Bottom trawling often tears up the ocean bottom and can be very destructive to all bottom dwelling fish. Trawling involves the use of a system of nets deployed on or near the sea floor. Benthic trawling is towing or dragging a net at the very bottom of the ocean. Demersal trawling is towing a net just above the benthic zone. Midwater trawling (pelagic trawling) is trawling, or net fishing nearer the surface of the ocean.|$|R

The natural resource management plan of the Shiretoko site is characterized by transparency and consensus building, because (i) UNESCO and IUCN require that the plan be sustainable and (ii) the Government of Japan has guaranteed local fisheries {{that there will be no}} additional regulations included in the plan. The Marine Management Plan describes which species and factors are monitored, how these data are evaluated, and how the benchmarks specified by ecosystem management are determined. The plan will provide a valuable example for the establishment of "environment-friendly fisheries" in Japan and other countries, because it includes voluntary activities by resource users that are suitable for use in a local context, flexible to ecological/social fluctuations, and efficiently implemented through increased legitimacy and compliance. This approach is appropriate for coastal communities where a large number of small-scale fishers catch a variety of species using various types of gear. We develop a method to evaluate fisheries integrity by <b>catch</b> and <b>yield</b> data...|$|R
40|$|Résumé For last 20 years, {{the fish}} {{communities}} in the Central Delta of the Niger River have been subjected to: (i) two drought periods in 1973 and 1984, (ii) a dramatic increase of fishing and, (iii) the building of an electric-power dam in 1984. At different levels, these various factors modified the biological cycle of the fish which are adapted to the former hydrological cycles of the Niger and the Bani rivers. The Sahelian drought is responsible for a decrease in both flood duration and of the inundated area of floodplain which varies from 20000 km 2 to 5000 km 2. From 1968 to 1989, fish landings dcclined from 90000 metric tons to 45 000 metric tons. During the same period, as fish <b>catches</b> fell, <b>yields</b> per hectare increased from 40 kg in 1968 to 120 kg in 1989. This phenomenon {{is linked to the}} decrease of {{the average age of the}} fish (69 % of fish catches are under one year old) in response to the increased fishing mortality and natural mortality which is higher during the drought period. The increase in fish productivity is characterized by a depletion of species such as Gymnarc~hus niloticus, Polypterus senegalus, Gnathonernus niger, whose reproduction are linked to the floodplains and of species like Citharinus citharus and Clarotes laticeps which visit frequently flooded areas. Concurrently, families such as the Cichlidae or Clariidae, which ar...|$|R
40|$|A {{floodplain}} fisheries {{survey was}} conducted out at two sites (Binh Long and Phu Thanh) in the Mekong Delta of southern Vietnam during the monsoon of 1992. The study found a minimum yield of 80 kg/ha/year at Binh Long and a minimum yield of 42 kg/ha/year at Phu Thanh, {{with an average of}} 61 kg/ha/year. At Binh Long more than 50 % of the catch belonged to the genus Cyprinidae including Cirrhi us jullieni (Sauvage 1878), Puntioplites proctozysron (Bleeker 1865) and Paralaubuca spp. At Phu Thanh crabs (Somaniathelphusa sinensis) and the snakehead (Ophiocephalus striatus, Bloch 1792), dominated the <b>catch.</b> The low <b>yield</b> estimated for the Phu Thanh site {{may be the result of}} low water pH, as this floodplain is located on moderate to severe acid sulphate soils which were disturbed following the modification of the hydrological regime during the last decade...|$|R
40|$|This report {{contains}} {{assessments of}} the conditions of groundfish and squid in the eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands region management area. The assessments are based on single species analyses of commercial fishery and research vessel survey data available through August 1986. Estimates of maximum sustainable yields and acceptable biological <b>catches</b> or equilibrium <b>yields</b> are presented to guide management of the 1987 fishery. Table A summarizes results of these assessments. Pacific cod, Gadus macrocephalus; yellowfin sole, Limanda aspera; and other flatfish remain in excellent condition with current populations at or near observed peak levels of abundance. The abundance of walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma, also remains relatively high with the exploitable population consisting of older (mainly ages 5 - 7 year) fish than in previous years. The condition of sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria, has improved in both the eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands region...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, views on {{fisheries}} management have oscillated between alarm {{and trust in}} management progress. The predominant policy for remedying the world fishing crisis aims at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by adjusting gear selectivity and fishing effort. Here we report a case study on how striving for higher yields from the Eastern Baltic cod stock by increasing selectivity has become exceedingly detrimental for its productivity. Although there is a successive increase in numbers of undersized fish, growth potential is severely reduced, and fishing mortality in fishable size has increased. Once density-dependent growth is introduced, the process is self-enforcing {{as long as the}} recruitment remains stable. Our findings suggest that policies focusing on maximum yield while targeting greater sizes are risky and should instead prioritize <b>catch</b> rates over <b>yield.</b> Disregarding the underlying population structure may jeopardize stock productivity, with dire consequences for the fishing industry and ecosystem structure and function...|$|R
40|$|Biodiverse {{coastal zones}} are often areas of intense fishing {{pressure}} {{due to the}} high relative density of fishing capacity in these nearshore regions. Although overcapacity {{is one of the}} central challenges to fisheries sustainability in coastal zones, accurate estimates of fishing pressure in coastal zones are limited, hampering the assessment of the direct and collateral impacts (e. g., habitat degradation, bycatch) of fishing. We compiled a comprehensive database of fishing effort metrics and the corresponding spatial limits of fisheries and used a spatial analysis program (FEET) to map fishing effort density (measured as boat-meters per km 2) in the coastal zones of six ocean regions. We also considered the utility of a number of socioeconomic variables as indicators of fishing pressure at the national level; fishing density increased as a function of population size and decreased as a function of coastline length. Our mapping exercise points to intra and interregional ‘hotspots’ of coastal fishing pressure. The significant and intuitive relationships we found between fishing density and population size and coastline length may help with coarse regional characterizations of fishing pressure. However, spatially-delimited fishing effort data are needed to accurately map fishing hotspots, i. e., areas of intense fishing activity. We suggest that estimates of fishing effort, not just target <b>catch</b> or <b>yield,</b> serve as a necessary measure of fishing activity, which is a key link to evaluating sustainability and environmental impacts of coastal fisheries...|$|R
40|$|Ichthyoplankton {{dynamics}} in the permanently open Kowie Estuary, {{in the warm}} temperate region of South Africa was investigated. The composition, abundance, distribution and seasonality of larval fishes were studied over a two year period between 2004 and 2006. Additionally, tidal exchange of ichthyoplankton {{and the use of}} frontal zones in the mouth region of the estuary were also explored between 2008 and 2009. Temporal and spatial trends in occurrence of larval fishes within the estuary and associated marina were obtained from data collected seasonally using boat-based plankton netting at 14 sampling stations {{along the length of the}} estuary. A total of 11 128 larval fishes were collected, representing 23 families and 38 taxa. Clupeidae and Gobiidae were the dominant fish families, contributing 47. 0 % and 24. 7 % respectively to the total catch. Estuarine resident species dominated the overall catch (91 %). A notable absence of older stage larvae and early juveniles characterised the artificial channels of the marina and estuary mouth region. This was attributed to the absence of a shallow, marginal water habitat typical of successful estuarine nursery areas. Tidal exchange of larval fishes was investigated in the Kowie Estuary using a new technique. A set of drifting light traps were set repetitively on the ebb and flood tide every second night for two consecutive 14 day periods during the peak estuarine recruitment period. A total of 553 larval fishes were caught during the study, representing nine families and 26 species. Blenniidae and Clupeidae dominated the catches. Family and species occurrence changed with tide state. Species richness (d) and diversity (H’) varied with tide and was highest on flood tides. Estuary-dependent species, such as Omobranchus woodii were more dominant on flood tides, whilst larvae of marine-spawned species, such as Sardinops sagax, were dominant on the ebb tide. Light trap <b>catches</b> <b>yielded</b> a different composition in terms of development stage / size and species, when compared to towed net studies. Towed plankton nets were again used to study the shear fronts that characterise the mouth region of the canalised Kowie Estuary. It was hypothesised that the convergence zone of the front provides feeding opportunities for ichthyoplankton. Ichthyoplankton, zooplankton and phytoplankton was collected from within and immediately outside of the convergence zone during frontal conditions. Species specific distribution trends emerged from this study. Postflexion larvae and early juvenile stages of the estuary dependent Mugilidae were only present in the foam line of the convergence zones. Some known predators of ichthyoplankton were also present in slightly higher numbers in the convergence zone (isopods) while other predators such as mysid shrimps, chaetognaths and cnidarians were more abundant out of the convergence zone. It appears that these zones may provide access to temporary food patches in the lower estuary but will be accompanied by a trade-off with increased isopod predators. The Kowie Estuary is a heavily impacted system and lack of adequate freshwater supply; artificial channelling and pollution ultimately have a negative impact of the success of this system as a nursery area. Rehabilitation of marginal areas in the lower estuary and marina is suggested as remedial action to re-establish the integrity of the nursery function this system could offer...|$|R
40|$|A crop {{rotation}} experiment {{was established in}} 1996 / 97 at three locations representing different soil types and climates. Three factors were tested: i) {{crop rotation}} with different proportions of N 2 -fixing crops, ii) with and without a catch crop, and iii) with and without animal manure. A green manure crop increased yields in the following cereal crops, but at the rotational level, total yields were larger in crop rotations without a green manure crop. There were positive effects of animal manure and <b>catch</b> crops on <b>yield.</b> However, except for the coarse sandy soil, the <b>yield</b> effects of <b>catch</b> crops and animal manure decreased over time when a grass-clover green manure {{was included in the}} rotation. It appeared that the buffering effect of clover can counteract the positive yield effects of manure application and catch crop use. This shows the importance of assessing long-term effects in the evaluation of crop management measures...|$|R
40|$|Groundfish {{fisheries}} target {{big skate}} (Raja binoculata) off the British Columbia coast. Catch comes mainly from Queen Charlotte Sound (QCS) and North Hecate Strait (NHS). Until now, sufficient data to evaluate stock status was not available. I parameterized a Graham-Schaefer model using catch (1996 - 2010), catch-per-unit-effort (1996 - 2010), and fishery-independent surveys (1984 - 2009) to estimate current abundance. QCS and NHS appear stable at their median estimated carrying capacities of 698, 000 and 501, 000 tonnes. Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) equalled 21, 800 and 16, 200 tonnes for QCS and NHS. Depletion-corrected average <b>catch</b> (DCAC) potential <b>yield,</b> {{a conservative estimate}} of MSY, equalled 17, 500 and 13, 000 tonnes for QCS and NHS. DCAC sustainable yield, total removals that may likely maintain a stock at current abundance, equalled 370 and 330 tonnes for QCS and NHS. To maintain current abundance, managers should monitor catches and keep them similar to historic catches since they {{do not appear to}} affect population dynamics...|$|R
40|$|The {{off-shore}} demersal trap {{fishery in}} the southern Arabian Gulf has been managed by gear regulations and effort constraints which were aimed at rebuilding depleted stocks. In order to evaluate {{the success of these}} regulations, a variety of selectivity and other fishery metrics were compared for the key species (Diagramma pictum, Epinephelus coioides and Lethrinus nebulosus) before and after their introduction. With the exception of a minor increase in the mean age at first capture from 1. 3 yrs to 1. 9 yrs for E. coioides, there were no significant changes in the values or trends in juvenile retention, mean size or the mean sizes and ages at first capture. The comparison of selectivity ogives with data derived independently through an experimental fishing program indicated that the failure of juvenile escape panels to modify the selectivity characteristics of the fishery could not be attributed to a lack of compliance. Furthermore, there were no significant changes in fishing mortality rates, harvest rates, <b>catch,</b> effort, <b>yield</b> per recruit and relative spawner biomass per recruit following the introduction of the management regulations. Age structures were highly truncated and the management measures had failed to increase the relative proportion of older age classes. Stock status indicators suggested that all species were heavily over-exploited with evidence of both growth and recruitment over-fishing. Given the failure of existing regulations to modify gear selectivity, reduce effort and rebuild stocks, {{the results of the study}} suggest that management authorities should consider alternative measures including a moratorium on the use of traps in the off-shore demersal fishery of Abu Dhabi...|$|R
