40|$|We {{study the}} writhe, twist and {{magnetic}} helicity of different magnetic flux ropes, based on {{models of the}} solar coronal magnetic field structure. These include an analytical force-free Titov [...] Démoulin equilibrium solution, non force-free magnetohydrodynamic simulations, and nonlinear force-free magnetic field models. The geometrical boundary of the magnetic flux rope {{is determined by the}} quasi-separatrix layer and the bottom surface, and the axis curve of the flux rope is determined by its overall orientation. The twist is computed by the Berger [...] Prior formula that is suitable for arbitrary geometry and both force-free and non-force-free models. The magnetic helicity is estimated by the twist multiplied by the square of the axial magnetic flux. We compare the obtained values with those derived by a finite volume helicity estimation method. We find that the magnetic helicity obtained with the twist method agrees with the helicity carried by the purely <b>current-carrying</b> <b>part</b> of the field within uncertainties for most test cases. It is also found that the <b>current-carrying</b> <b>part</b> of the model field is relatively significant at the very location of the magnetic flux rope. This qualitatively explains the agreement between the magnetic helicity computed by the twist method and the helicity contributed purely by the current-carrying magnetic field.

40|$|The {{mathematical}} {{models for}} {{group of the}} parallel thyristors on the intervals of distributing the switched on state and switching-off have been developed. The combinations of the parameters in the thyristors and <b>current-carrying</b> <b>parts</b> permitting to decrease {{the influence of the}} transients in the parallel thyristors on the load distribution between them have been determined. The work results have been used at formation of the requirements to the making-up a set of the converters with the thyristors and determination of the parameters in the <b>current-carrying</b> <b>parts</b> and protective RC-circuits of the converters without current dividers.

The pressing device comprises one of the actuator. The pressing device is formed by a screw (30) and a spring. The screw comprises another actuator.

25|$|Low-voltage {{miniature}} {{circuit breakers}} (MCB) use air alone to extinguish the arc. These circuit breakers contain so-called arc chutes, a stack of mutually insulated parallel metal plates which divide and cool the arc. By splitting the arc into smaller arcs the arc is cooled down while the arc voltage is increased and serves as an additional impedance which limits the current through the circuit breaker. The <b>current-carrying</b> <b>parts</b> near the contacts provide easy deflection of the arc into the arc chutes by a magnetic force of a current path, although magnetic blowout coils or permanent magnets could also deflect the arc into the arc chute (used on circuit breakers for higher ratings).So The number of plates in the arc chute {{is dependent on the}} short-circuit rating and nominal voltage of the circuit breaker.|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} {{was carried}} out within a current German research project at TÜV Rheinland in Germany together with the Fraunhofer Institute ISE and the Fire Department of Munich, which examines fire risks and determines enhanced safety measures for PV systems. In principle, contact defects (due to production faults or thermo-mechanical fatigue) in the DC circuit of a module can be named as potential sources of arcs during the operating lifetime. This work reflects general strategies for qualifying risks at cell connectors in general and transfers them to arcing risks in PV modules. To generate technical data, 20 crystalline PV modules with soldering defects were exposed to different test sequences to reproduce similar faults such as focal overheating or even electric arcs. On this basis, combinations of dynamic mechanical or thermo-mechanical loads were applied with a forward bias to induce stressing on the <b>current-carrying</b> <b>parts</b> and connector joints in a module. The derivation of a potentially useful test method is given and production-oriented quality monitoring measures are proposed...|$|R
