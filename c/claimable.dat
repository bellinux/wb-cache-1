25|$|Income tax: A {{number of}} MPs were criticised for non-payment of income tax for {{benefits}} in kind or for reimbursed expenses considered under UK tax law to be of a personal nature. As of 31 May 2009, some 40 MPs had been identified as claiming for personal expenses such as preparation of their tax returns, despite UK tax law and ministerial guidance both of which had stated such expenses were not <b>claimable</b> for tax purposes; of those claiming, only a minority paid tax on the benefit in kind.|$|E
25|$|The debtor may {{not make}} a {{contract}} which purports to dispose of any property of his insolvent estate. Furthermore, he may not, without the written consent of the trustee, {{enter into a contract}} which adversely affects his estate or any contribution which he is obliged to make towards his estate. That contribution is what is <b>claimable</b> by the trustee in terms of section 23(5) from moneys earned by the insolvent {{in the course of his}} profession, occupation or employment. The contribution becomes due to the trustee only once the Master has expressed the opinion that the moneys in question are not necessary for the support of the insolvent and his dependents. It follows that, prior to the Master’s assessment of a contribution, the insolvent need not obtain the trustee’s consent to enter into the contract.|$|E
25|$|Employees {{wages and}} {{pensions}} have preferential status, but {{only up to}} an £800 limit, a figure which has remained unchanged since 1986. Employees having priority among creditors, albeit not above fixed security holders, dates back to 1897, and is justified {{on the ground that}} employees are particularly incapable, unlike banks, of diversifying their risk, and forms one of the requirements in the ILO Protection of Workers' Claims (Employer's Insolvency) Convention. Often this limited preference is not enough, and can {{take a long time to}} realise. Reflecting the Insolvency Protection Directive under ERA 1996 section 166 any employee may lodge a claim with the National Insurance Fund for outstanding wages. Under ERA 1996 section 182 the amount <b>claimable</b> is the same as that for unfair dismissal (£350 in 2010) for a limit of 8 weeks. If an employee has been unpaid for a longer period, she may choose the most beneficial 8 weeks.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Public Law 109-8 [...] {{amended the}} Bankruptcy Code, by {{exempting}} most organized retirement plans, even those {{not subject to}} ERISA, and accorded them protected status, <b>claimable</b> as exempt property by a debtor declaring bankruptcy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.|$|E
2500|$|It is popularly {{considered}} that perpetual check – where one player gives {{a series of}} checks from which the other player cannot escape – is a draw, but in fact {{there is no longer}} a specific rule for this in the laws of chess, because any perpetual check situation will eventually be <b>claimable</b> as a draw under the threefold repetition rule or by the fifty-move rule, or (more likely) by agreement [...] By 1965 perpetual check was no longer in the official rules [...]|$|E
2500|$|The UK tax {{authority}} HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has identified around 40 MPs, including the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, as having claimed for their tax return costs. A minority {{of these have}} affirmed they paid tax on the sums involved; HMRC have confirmed they are investigating former Chancellor Alistair Darling's tax claims, {{along with those of}} others involved. Darling had claimed the costs of preparing his tax return as an expense of his office, although tax law regards them as personal costs. Lord Millett, a former Law Lord, described Darling's claim as [...] "astounding", and guidance to ministers in 2005 had stated that such expenses were not <b>claimable</b> for tax purposes.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{this last}} possibility, article 10 of the FIDE laws of chess states {{that when a}} player has {{less than two minutes}} left on their clock during a rapid play finish (the end of a game when all {{remaining}} moves must be completed within a limited amount of time), they may claim a draw if their opponent is not attempting to win the game by [...] "normal means" [...] or cannot win the game by [...] "normal means". [...] "Normal means" [...] can be taken to mean the delivery of checkmate or the winning of material. In other words, a draw is <b>claimable</b> if the opponent is merely attempting to win on time, or cannot possibly win except on time. It is up to the arbiter to decide whether such a claim will be granted or not.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{separate}} initiatives were {{pursued in}} 2011 {{to transform the}} tax credit into an instant cash rebate; these did not pass. The objective of both initiatives was to make new qualifying plug-in electric cars more accessible to buyers by making the incentive more effective. The rebate would have been available {{at the point of}} sale allowing consumers to avoid a wait of up to a year to apply the tax credit against income tax returns. The first initiative was from Senator Debbie Stabenow who reintroduced the [...] "Charging America Forward Act." [...] This bill was introduced in August 2010 but was not voted by the full Senate. The bill would have turned the tax credit into a rebate worth up to [...] for plug-in electric vehicles and also would have provided businesses with a tax credit for purchasing medium or heavy duty plug-in hybrid trucks. The other initiative was from the Obama Administration and was submitted in the FY2012 Budget as a provision to transform the existing credit into a rebate that would have been <b>claimable</b> by dealers and passed along to the consumers, this {{was not included in the}} Budget.|$|E
2500|$|The {{priority}} list in insolvency sees creditors with fixed security (typically banks) get paid first. Second are preferential creditors. Third are unsecured creditors up to {{a limit of}} £600,000. Fourth are floating charge holders (usually banks again). Fifth are remaining debts to unsecured creditors (in the unlikely event that anything remains). Sixth are [...] "deferred debts" [...] (typically to company insiders). Last are shareholders. Among the preferential creditors, the insolvency practitioners' fees together with adopted contracts attain super-priority. Otherwise, employees wages and pensions still have preferential status, but only up to an £800 limit, a figure which has remained unchanged since 1986. Employees having priority among creditors, albeit not above fixed security holders, dates back to 1897, and is justified {{on the ground that}} employees are particularly incapable, unlike banks, of diversifying their risk, and forms one of the requirements in the ILO Protection of Workers' Claims (Employer's Insolvency) Convention.

If an employee has been unpaid for a longer period, she may choose the most beneficial 8 weeks. The Pensions Act 2004 governs a separate system for protecting pension claims, through the Pension Protection Fund. This aims to fully insure all pension claims. Together with minimum redundancy payments, the guarantees of wages form a meagre cushion which requires more of a systematic supplementation when people remain unemployed.|$|E
6000|$|Together {{with this}} {{great source of}} pre-eminence in mass of colour, we have to {{estimate}} {{the influence of the}} finished inlaying and enamel-work of the colour-jewellery on every stone; and that of the continual variety in species of flower; most of the mountain flowers being, besides, separately lovelier than the lowland ones. The wood hyacinth and wild rose are, indeed, the only supreme flowers that the lowlands can generally show; and the wild rose is also a mountaineer, and more fragrant in the hills, while the wood hyacinth, or grape hyacinth, at its best cannot match even the dark bell-gentian, leaving the light-blue star-gentian in its uncontested queenliness, and the Alpine rose and Highland heather wholly without similitude. The violet, lily of the valley, crocus, and wood anemone are, I suppose, <b>claimable</b> partly by the plains as well as the hills; but the large orange lily and narcissus I have never seen but on hill pastures, and the exquisite oxalisis pre-eminently a mountaineer.[26] ...|$|E
60|$|This big, dark, {{abstracted}} {{man who was}} {{so nervous}} when a pony cantered behind him, used to moon in the train of Mrs. Reiver, blushing with pleasure when she threw {{a word or two}} his way. His admiration was strictly platonic: even other women saw and admitted this. He did not move out in Simla, so he heard nothing against his idol: which was satisfactory. Mrs. Reiver took no special notice of him, beyond seeing that he was added to her list of admirers, and going for a walk with him now and then, just to show that he was her property, <b>claimable</b> as such. Moriarty must have done most of the talking, for Mrs. Reiver couldn't talk much to a man of his stamp; and the little she said could not have been profitable. What Moriarty believed in, as he had good reason to, was Mrs. Reiver's influence over him, and, in that belief, set himself seriously to try {{to do away with the}} vice that only he himself knew of.|$|E
50|$|Predictive {{costs are}} costs <b>claimable</b> at law by claimant's solicitors.|$|E
50|$|The maximum living {{expenses}} <b>claimable</b> were $20,000, which increased to $22,000 under the Senate's June 5, 2012 Travel Policy.|$|E
50|$|Deductibles are {{normally}} provided as clauses in {{an insurance policy}} that dictate {{how much of an}} insurance-covered expense is borne by the policyholder. They {{are normally}} quoted as a fixed quantity and are a part of most policies covering losses to the policy holder. The insurer then becomes liable for <b>claimable</b> expenses that exceed this amount (subject to the maximum sum <b>claimable</b> indicated in the contract). Depending on the policy, the deductible may apply per covered incident, or per year. For policies where incidents are not easy to delimit (health insurance, for example), the deductible is typically applied per year.|$|E
50|$|Filers {{who are not}} {{claiming}} a qualifying child must be {{between the ages of}} 25 and 64 inclusive. For a married couple without a qualifying child, only one spouse must be within this age range. For a single person with a qualify child, there is no age requirement per se other than the requirement that the single person not himself or herself be <b>claimable</b> as another relative's qualifying child (see Age section above). A married couple with at least one qualifying child is only occasionally classified as <b>claimable</b> by another relative, especially if the married couple has earned income and elects to claim EIC.|$|E
50|$|Under United States tax law, itemized {{deductions}} {{are eligible}} expenses that individual taxpayers can claim on {{federal income tax}} returns and which decrease their taxable income, and is <b>claimable</b> {{in place of a}} standard deduction, if available.|$|E

5000|$|A {{single parent}} younger than age 19 {{living in an}} {{extended}} family situation is potentially <b>claimable</b> as the qualifying [...] "child" [...] of an older relative. And a single parent under age 24 {{who is also a}} full-time college student (one long semester or equivalent) living in an extended family situation is also potentially <b>claimable.</b> If so, the younger single parent cannot claim EIC. This rule does not apply to a married couple who are claiming EIC with a child, even if one or both spouses are under the age of 19. (This rule also does not apply if the older relative is not required to file a tax return, and subsequently either does not file or only files to receive a full refund of taxes withheld.) ...|$|E
50|$|Waiting periods {{are also}} used for new {{insurance}} policies, particularly health insurance and flood insurance. Incidents which occur during this time are not <b>claimable.</b> The term may also refer to the time between {{the making of a}} claim and the payment of it, also called the elimination period.|$|E
50|$|Figures {{from the}} CAA show that on average 221.1 million {{terminal}} passengers per year use British airports. According to statistics {{released by the}} European Commission an average of 1.5 percent of flights to/from British airports each year are delayed or cancelled by {{more than three hours}} and so could potentially be <b>claimable.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Hong Kong, {{similar to}} the {{situation}} in England, engagements to marry are not enforceable at law by legislation, damages for distress caused and reliance on the breach of promise are <b>claimable,</b> if the plaintiff suffers sufficiently serious consequences in light of the specific circumstances, for instance in Cheung Suk Man v So Shek Keung 1965 HKLR 485.|$|E
50|$|There is {{also one}} lesser {{judicial}} officer, called the Associate Judge (previously called the Master), with responsibility for largely procedural matters in civil and criminal proceedings, and for some work in assessing the damages (amounts <b>claimable)</b> in civil proceedings. The current Associate Judge of the Supreme Court of Tasmania is Mr Stephen Holt (appointed 6 September 1999).|$|E
5000|$|... 45¢ - 2000 (effective 1 July 2000. With the {{introduction}} of the GST, the postage component was decreased to absorb the new GST cost, so for the public there was no change in stamp prices. For businesses the GST <b>claimable</b> component of the postage rate was 4¢, leaving a reduced cost to business users of just 41¢.|$|E
5000|$|The oil {{depletion}} allowance in American (US) tax law is an allowance <b>claimable</b> by anyone with an economic {{interest in a}} mineral deposit or standing timber. [...] The principle is that the asset is a capital investment that is a wasting asset, and therefore depreciation can reasonably be offset (effectively as a capital loss) against income.|$|E
50|$|In {{light of}} a change in the law, the model on which the Accident Group {{operated}} began to fail. Legal costs undertaken by the claimant were moved from <b>claimable</b> against the other party, to payable by the claimant. This meant that the amount of money paid to claimants dramatically fell, whilst the money payable to solicitors undertaking the claims were too high.|$|E
50|$|Where {{the agent}} exceeds his {{authority}} in concluding a contract, the agent {{is liable to}} the third party, not on the contract, but for damages for breach of an implied warranty of authority. The measure of damages <b>claimable</b> by the third party {{is the amount of}} loss sustained by the third party because of the non-performance of the intended contract by the principal.|$|E
50|$|Expenditure on a {{business}} (such as a property business) made by an individual can be claimed as an allowance against Capital Gains. Whether expenditure is <b>claimable</b> against income (potentially reducing income tax) or capital (potentially reducing capital gains tax) depends on whether there was improvement of the property: if there was none, it is against income; if there was some, then it is against capital.|$|E
50|$|In Rubin v Botha, an {{important}} {{case in the}} South African law of lease, Botha purported to lease to Rubin and his partner {{a piece of land}} for a period of ten years. No money was to pass, but the purported lessee was to erect a dwelling house, a stable and a fowl-run, for which no compensation was to be <b>claimable</b> {{at the end of the}} lease.|$|E
50|$|In Malaysia, the Federal Court in Majlis Perbandaran Ampang v Steven Phoa Cheng Loon 2006 2 AMR 563 {{followed}} {{the decision in}} Caparo Industries v Dickman 1990 UKHL 2 where it held; pure economic loss is <b>claimable</b> if 1) the damage was foreseeable, 2) {{the relationship between the}} parties was one of sufficient proximity, and 3) it is fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care on the defendant.|$|E
50|$|The Ticket to Ride Dice Expansion, {{compatible}} with any map (although the 9-train route in Nordic Countries and Rails & Sails The Great Lakes, and the 10-train route in United Kingdom are not <b>claimable</b> with this expansion), {{was released in}} 2008. Instead of drawing train car cards, players roll dice {{and use them to}} claim routes, take destination tickets, or perform other actions. Tunnel dice are used instead of drawing cards when players try to build tunnels in maps that include them.|$|E

50|$|Where {{a married}} couple is jointly {{assessed}} to tax, {{and one of the}} couple works in the home caring for one or more dependent persons, the couple can claim a home carer tax credit. To claim the full credit of €810, the carer must earn less than €5,080. The credit is decreased by €1 for every €2 the carer earns above that amount, so that a carer earning over €6,700 cannot claim the credit, but once granted the credit will still be <b>claimable</b> in future years, as long as the couple does not claim the increase in standard-rate band for dual-income couples.|$|E
