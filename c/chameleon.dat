5|$|Animals such as <b>chameleon,</b> frog, {{flatfish}} such as {{the peacock}} flounder, squid and octopus actively change their skin patterns and colours using special chromatophore cells to resemble their current background, or, as in most chameleons, for signalling. However, Smith's dwarf <b>chameleon</b> does use active colour change for camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Book II The {{different}} parts of red-blooded animals. Aristotle writes about limbs, the teeth of dogs, horses, man, and elephant; the elephant's tongue; and of animals such as the apes, crocodile, <b>chameleon,</b> birds especially the wryneck, fishes and snakes.|$|E
5|$|In most {{grasshopper}} species, {{conflicts between}} males over females rarely escalate beyond ritualistic displays. Some exceptions include the <b>chameleon</b> grasshopper (Kosciuscola tristis), where males may fight {{on top of}} ovipositing females; engaging in leg grappling, biting, kicking and mounting.|$|E
50|$|In 2002 The <b>Chameleons</b> Group created <b>Chameleons</b> 4 - The Doors of Serenity, {{directed}} by Steve Dixon. Dixon also devised and performed the performance alongside <b>Chameleons</b> Group members Anna Fenemore, Wendy Reed and Barry Woods.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chameleons</b> can be {{confined}} in hollow containers because their mass increases rapidly as they penetrate the container wall, {{causing them to}} reflect. One strategy to search experimentally for <b>chameleons</b> is to direct photons into a cavity, confining the <b>chameleons</b> produced, and then to switch off the light source. <b>Chameleons</b> would be indicated {{by the presence of}} an afterglow as they decay back into photons.|$|R
5000|$|Bradypodion (meaning [...] "slow-footed") {{is one of}} six genera of <b>chameleons</b> {{within the}} [...] "true" [...] or [...] "typical" [...] <b>chameleons</b> (Family Chamaeleonidae). They are native to {{southern}} Africa, and are sometimes collectively called South African dwarf <b>chameleons.</b> Some other small <b>chameleons</b> from eastern and central Africa are occasionally placed herein, but this is probably in error and not followed here.

5|$|The cathedral {{is home to}} Wells Cathedral Oratorio Society (WCOS), {{founded in}} 1896. With around 160 voices the society gives three concerts a year under the {{direction}} of Matthew Owens, Organist and Master of the Choristers at the Cathedral. Concerts are normally in early November, December (an annual performance of Handel's Messiah) and late March. It performs with a number of specialist orchestras including: Music for Awhile, <b>Chameleon</b> Arts and La Folia.|$|E
5000|$|Color {{change in}} <b>chameleons</b> has {{functions}} in camouflage, but most commonly in social signaling and in reactions to temperature and other conditions. The {{relative importance of}} these functions varies with the circumstances, {{as well as the}} species. Color change signals a chameleon's physiological condition and intentions to other <b>chameleons.</b> <b>Chameleons</b> tend to show brighter colors when displaying aggression to other <b>chameleons,</b> and darker colors when they submit or [...] "give up".|$|R

5|$|The chapter {{ends with}} a {{discussion}} of animals that can change colour, including fish like the sole, the <b>chameleon,</b> the horned lizards and the tree frogs including the European species Hyla arborea. He cites Poulton's suggestion that the tree frog's camouflage may be both defensive (protecting from predators) and aggressive (facilitating the hunting of insects).|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other mammals, {{including}} the cat-like fossa, are endemic to Madagascar. Over 300 species of birds have been recorded on the island, of which over 60percent (including four families and 42 genera) are endemic. The few families and genera of reptile that have reached Madagascar have diversified into more than 260 species, with over 90percent of these being endemic (including one endemic family). The island is home to two-thirds of the world's <b>chameleon</b> species, including the smallest known, and researchers have proposed that Madagascar may be the origin of all chameleons.|$|E
5|$|By June, {{the band}} had {{performed}} another Italian tour (the third that year) {{and wanted to}} start recording new material (some of which ended up on Hammill's 1973 solo album <b>Chameleon</b> in the Shadow of the Night). However, the combination of working for too long without a break, combined {{with a lack of}} support from Stratton-Smith and Charisma and continued financial difficulties caused the band to implode, and Hammill left to pursue a solo career in mid-1972.|$|E
50|$|With few exceptions, the <b>chameleons</b> most {{commonly}} seen in captivity are {{all members of}} Chamaeleo, notably the common, Senegal and veiled <b>chameleons,</b> but even they require special care.|$|R
50|$|Rhampholeon is a genus {{of small}} <b>chameleons,</b> {{commonly}} known as pygmy <b>chameleons</b> or African leaf <b>chameleons,</b> found in central East Africa (extending slightly into adjacent DR Congo). They are found in forests, woodlands, thickets, and savanna, and most species are restricted to highlands. They are brown, grey, or green, and typically seen at low levels in bushes, or on the ground among grasses or leaf litter.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the {{arboreal}} <b>chameleons</b> of {{the genus}} Chamaeleo, its tail is not prehensile, but otherwise it still hunts in the same way, slowly stalking its prey and catching it with its long tongue. Namaqua <b>chameleons</b> feed on insects, (particularly beetles and crickets); lizards, including young <b>chameleons</b> of their own species; small snakes; and even scorpions. They hunt their prey in both sandy dunes and rocky areas.|$|R
5|$|In this 6-minute short film, he entire kingdom is {{preparing}} for Rapunzel's marriage to Eugene. Several guests are in attendance, including Rapunzel's birth parents, the King and Queen, the pub thugs and the Stabbington Brothers, while their animal friends Pascal, a <b>chameleon,</b> and Maximus, a horse, serve as the Flower boy and ring bearer respectively. Just as a brown-haired Rapunzel, accompanied by her father, completes her journey down the aisle to unite with Eugene, Maximus, who is carrying the wedding rings on a pillow in his mouth, has a reaction to one of Pascal's flower petals and sneezes, expelling the rings {{down the aisle and}} out onto the city streets.|$|E
5|$|T'Pol, {{working out}} in the gym, also keeps urging Archer to {{apologize}} to the Kreetassans for Porthos' behavior, but Archer resists because he blames them for Porthos' illness. In the end, Porthos recovers following a pituitary transplant from an alien <b>chameleon.</b> Finally swallowing his pride, Archer then goes down to the Kreetassan capital and delivers an intricate ritual apology which involves slicing a tree trunk with a chainsaw, arranging the pieces of wood in a complex pattern on the ground, and chanting phrases in the Kreetassan language. Having successfully apologised to the Kreetassans, the crew finally manage to procure three plasma injectors prior to their departure.|$|E
5|$|Knuckles' Chaotix is a side-scrolling, action-platform {{game that}} shares {{the same basic}} {{gameplay}} elements that defined earlier entries in the Sonic series. New to this game, however, is a partner mechanic which tethers the player to a computer or human-controlled partner. This tether behaves like a rubber band, and requires the player(s) to use its physics to maneuver through the zones. Players can choose between playing as five different characters, each with their own unique set of moves. Knuckles the Echidna can glide and climb walls, Mighty the Armadillo can jump up and kick off walls, Espio the <b>Chameleon</b> can run along walls and ceilings, Vector the Crocodile can boost {{through the air and}} climb walls, and Charmy Bee can fly and hover in the air. There are two other partner characters, Heavy the Robot and Bomb, who hinder players' progress due to their slow or destructive nature, respectively. The story follows the group's efforts to save a mysterious island from Doctor Robotnik and Metal Sonic, who are using its magical Chaos Rings for their evil plans.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chameleons</b> {{primarily}} live in {{the mainland}} of sub-Saharan Africa and {{on the island of}} Madagascar, although a few species live in northern Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East, southern India, Sri Lanka, and several smaller islands in the western Indian Ocean. There are introduced, feral populations of veiled and Jackson's <b>chameleons</b> in Hawaii, and isolated pockets of feral Jackson's <b>chameleons</b> have been reported in California and Florida.|$|R
40|$|<b>Chameleons</b> are a well {{motivated}} scalar field {{that might explain}} the observed late time accelerated expansion of the universe. <b>Chameleons</b> possess the interesting property that their mass, and hence interaction range, {{is dependent on the}} density of their environment. One very appealing feature of <b>chameleons</b> is the potential to test a model of dark energy in a laboratory setting. Here we briefly review two proposed experiments to search for <b>chameleons</b> using neutron interferometry techniques for the Snowmass 2013 Community Summer Study.

50|$|For a {{long time}} {{it was thought that}} <b>chameleons</b> change color by {{dispersion}} of pigment-containing organelles within their skin. However, research conducted in 2014 on panther <b>chameleons</b> has shown that pigment movement only represents part of the story.|$|R
5|$|The {{distinctive}} spike-like {{crest of}} Saurolophus {{has been interpreted}} in multiple ways, and could have had multiple functions. Brown compared it to {{the crest of a}} <b>chameleon,</b> and suggested it could provide an area for muscle attachment and a connection point for a nonbody back frill like that seen in the basilisk lizard. Peter Dodson interpreted similar features in other duckbills as having use in sexual identification. Maryańska and Osmólska, noting the hollow base, suggested that the crest increased the surface area of the respiratory cavity, and helped in thermoregulation. James Hopson supported a function as a visual signal, and further mentioned the possibility that the inflatable skin flaps over the nostrils could have acted as resonators and additional visual signals. This idea has been picked up by authors of popular dinosaur works, such as David B. Norman, who discussed hadrosaurid display at length and included a life restoration of such an adaptation in action.|$|E
5|$|The loss {{of teeth}} with age in Limusaurus {{is the most}} extreme case of tooth {{morphology}} changing with age among dinosaurs. In fact, Limusaurus {{is one of the}} only known jawed vertebrates where teeth are completely lost during ontogeny (the others are the red mullet and striped red mullet, several armored catfish, and the platypus). Its complicated pattern of losing teeth from both the front and the back is most {{similar to that of the}} avialan Jeholornis. The temporary halt in tooth replacement likely results from the replacement tooth buds regressing, as in the veiled <b>chameleon.</b> Combined with the retention of the developmental signal pathways necessary to induce tooth development in birds, the ontogenetic replacement of teeth by a beak in Limusaurus suggests that the development of beaks in other lineages of theropods, and indeed beaked animals in general, may be related to developmental changes that heterochronically alter the point at which tooth development halts.|$|E

50|$|Like snakes, <b>chameleons</b> do {{not have}} an outer or a middle ear, so there is neither an ear opening nor an eardrum. However, <b>chameleons</b> are not deaf: they can detect sound {{frequencies}} in the range of 200-600 Hz.|$|R
25|$|Terrains with no {{suitable}} habitat include lawns, paved areas, brickwork, {{or higher}} trees with trunks too wide for <b>chameleons</b> to climb. Foliage should also not be pruned or trimmed, or exposed to insecticide poisons, as this usually kills or injures <b>chameleons.</b>|$|R

50|$|All <b>chameleons</b> are {{primarily}} insectivores that feed by ballistically projecting their long tongues from their mouths to capture prey located some distance away. While the chameleons' tongues are typically {{thought to be}} {{one and a half}} to two times the length of their bodies (their length excluding the tail), smaller <b>chameleons</b> (both smaller species and smaller individuals of the same species) have recently been found to have proportionately larger tongue apparatuses than their larger counterparts. Thus, smaller <b>chameleons</b> are able to project their tongues greater distances than the larger <b>chameleons</b> that are the subject of most studies and tongue length estimates, and can project their tongues more than twice their body length.|$|R
