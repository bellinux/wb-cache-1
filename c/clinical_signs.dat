5|$|Diagnosis {{includes}} {{determining the}} <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> {{and the medical}} history, with inquiry into possible routes of exposure. Clinical toxicologists, medical specialists {{in the area of}} poisoning, may be involved in diagnosis and treatment.|$|E
5|$|Cerebellar abiotrophy (CA or CCA). Recessive disorder, {{homozygous}} {{horses are}} affected, carriers show no signs. An affected foal is usually born without <b>clinical</b> <b>signs,</b> {{but at some}} stage, usually after six weeks of age, develops severe incoordination, a head tremor, wide-legged stance and other symptoms related {{to the death of}} the purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Such foals are frequently diagnosed only after they have crashed into a fence or fallen over backwards, and often are misdiagnosed as suffering from a head injury caused by an accident. Severity varies, with some foals having fast onset of severe coordination problems, others showing milder signs. Mildly affected horses can live a full lifespan, but most are euthanized before adulthood because they are so accident-prone as to be dangerous. As of 2008, there is a genetic test that uses DNA markers associated with CA to detect both carriers and affected animals. <b>Clinical</b> <b>signs</b> are distinguishable from other neurological conditions, and a diagnosis of CA can be verified by examining the brain after euthanasia.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{may also}} occur in {{someone who is}} receiving mechanical ventilation, in which case {{it may be difficult}} to spot as the person is typically receiving sedation; it is often noted because of a sudden deterioration in condition. Recent studies have shown that the development of tension features may not always be as rapid as previously thought. Deviation of the trachea to one side and the presence of raised jugular venous pressure (distended neck veins) are not reliable as <b>clinical</b> <b>signs.</b>|$|E
50|$|A jugular venous {{distension}} is {{the most}} sensitive <b>clinical</b> <b>sign</b> for acute decompensation.|$|R

5|$|Both {{dogs and}} horses are {{susceptible}} to the gastrointestinal side effects associated with salicylates, {{but it is a}} convenient treatment for arthritis in older dogs, and has shown some promise in cases of laminitis in horses. It is no longer commonly used for cases of laminitis, as it could be counterproductive for treatment. Aspirin should be used in animals only under the direct supervision of a veterinarian; in particular, cats lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin, making it potentially toxic. No <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> of toxicosis occurred when cats were given 25mg/kg of aspirin every 48 hours for 4 weeks.|$|E
5|$|The <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> and {{symptoms}} of AML result from the growth of leukemic clone cells, which tends to displace or interfere {{with the development of}} normal blood cells in the bone marrow. This leads to neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The symptoms of AML are, in turn, often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements. In rare cases, people with AML can develop a chloroma, or solid tumor of leukemic cells outside the bone marrow, which can cause various symptoms depending on its location.|$|E
5|$|As {{many of the}} <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> and {{symptoms}} of ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult. It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the blood ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography. Many hospital laboratories {{do not have the}} ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on the clinical presentation of the patient. In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the osmolal gap. The patients' serum osmolality is measured by freezing point depression and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.|$|E
50|$|In pathology, a {{cardinal}} sign or cardinal symptom {{is the primary}} or major <b>clinical</b> <b>sign</b> or symptom by which a diagnosis is made.|$|R

5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any <b>clinical</b> <b>signs,</b> it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{failure is}} where the heart can't beat out enough blood {{to meet the needs}} of the body. It is {{generally}} a chronic condition, associated with age, that progresses gradually. Each side of the heart can fail independently of the other, resulting in heart failure of the right heart or the left heart. Left heart failure can also lead to right heart failure (cor pulmonale) by increasing strain on the right heart. If the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood, it may accumulate throughout the body, causing breathlessness in the lungs (pulmonary congestion; pulmonary edema), swelling (edema) of the feet or other gravity-dependent areas, decrease exercise tolerance, or cause other <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> such as an enlarged liver, cardiac murmurs, or a raised jugular venous pressure. Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, valve disorders and diseases of cardiac muscle.|$|E
5|$|The forest cobra {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{frequent}} causes of snake bite among the African cobras, largely due its forest-dwelling habits but a bite by this species should be taken very seriously because it ranks as the 4th most venomous Naja (True Cobra) species. The symptomology is thought to be very {{similar to that of the}} Egyptian cobra (Naja haje). Clinical experience with this species has been very sparse, and few recorded bites have been documented. Deaths from respiratory failure due to severe neurotoxicity have been reported, but most victims will survive if prompt administration of antivenom is undertaken as soon as <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> of envenomation have been noted. Rare cases of spontaneous recoveries without the use of specific antivenom have also been seen; however, neglecting the use of antivenom places the patient at increased risk for major morbidity and mortality. If the snake becomes cornered or is agitated, it can quickly attack the aggressor, and because a large amount of venom is injected, a rapidly fatal outcome is possible. The mortality rate of an untreated bite is not exactly known but it is thought to be quite high. The forest cobra does not spit or spray its venom. This species is considered to be among the most intelligent of the African elapids by herpetologists.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionRecognition of a transient, focal {{neurologic}} dysfunction after {{a seizure}} is important when evaluating patients with idiopathic epilepsy. Todd's palsy, a transient focal weakness after a seizure, {{is a highly}} accurate <b>clinical</b> <b>sign</b> indicative of a contralateral, cerebral epileptic focus. In contrast, a transient, lateralized hyperkinetic motor behavior from a contralateral, hemispheric ictal focus has not been emphasized as a localizing <b>clinical</b> <b>sign.</b> The following case demonstrates that transient hyperkinetic behavior occurs as a post-ictal phenomenon and may have a localizing value, as in Todd's palsy...|$|R

25|$|The <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> in {{horses are}} similar to cattle. The muscle {{paralysis}} is progressive; it usually begins at the hindquarters and gradually moves to the front limbs, neck, and head. Death generally occurs 24 to 72 hours after initial symptoms and results from respiratory paralysis. Some foals are found dead without other <b>clinical</b> <b>signs.</b>|$|E
25|$|Poisoning {{with pain}} {{medications}} is common. Aspirin, paracetamol (acetaminophen, Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), and naproxen (Aleve) can all cause severe <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> in dogs, including vomiting blood, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Specifically, aspirin can cause metabolic acidosis and bleeding disorders, acetaminophen can cause liver disease, ibuprofen can cause kidney disease, and naproxen can cause ulcers in the stomach, which can perforate. Treatment {{depends on the}} <b>clinical</b> <b>signs.</b>|$|E

25|$|Elevated LDH can be {{an early}} <b>clinical</b> <b>sign</b> of a rare {{malignant}} cell tumor called a dysgerminoma. Not all dysgerminomas produce LDH, and this is often a non-specific finding.|$|R
25|$|The acute {{stage of}} the disease, {{occurring}} most often {{in the spring and}} summer, begins one to three weeks after infection and lasts for two to four weeks. <b>Clinical</b> <b>signs</b> include a fever, petechiae, bleeding disorders, vasculitis, lymphadenopathy, discharge from the nose and eyes, and edema of the legs and scrotum. There are no outward signs of the subclinical phase. <b>Clinical</b> <b>signs</b> of the chronic phase include weight loss, pale gums due to anemia, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, lymphadenopathy, dyspnea, coughing, polyuria, polydipsia, lameness, ophthalmic diseases such as retinal hemorrhage and anterior uveitis, and neurological disease. Dogs that are severely affected can die from this disease.|$|E
25|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is a heritable condition {{where the}} femur {{does not fit}} securely in the pelvic socket of the hip joint. This problem can exist with or without <b>clinical</b> <b>signs,</b> meaning some dogs feel pain in one or both rear legs.|$|E
25|$|The <b>clinical</b> <b>signs</b> {{are similar}} in other ruminants. In sheep and goats, the wool or hair is often damaged and easily shed, and {{diarrhea}} is uncommon. In deer, paratuberculosis can progress rapidly. Intestinal disease has also been reported in rabbits and nonhuman primates.|$|E
