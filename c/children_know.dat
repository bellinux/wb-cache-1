500|$|TV Fanatic's Christina Tran {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review, awarding it 4 out of 5 stars. She picked Susan's hamster burial scene {{and the scene}} in which Gabrielle eases Carlos' conscience her favorite scenes in the episode. Tran also appreciated the writers' decision not to prolong Tom and Lynette's attempts to hide their separation, opining: [...] "Last season, their fights were relentless and exhausting. I was glad that this storyline wasn’t dragged out too much, as Tom and Lynette were both able to rip off the band-aid and let their <b>children</b> <b>know</b> of their new status." [...] She also enjoyed {{the addition of the}} Ben character and hoped that the Renee character would receive her own storyline this season. John Griffiths of Us Weekly awarded the episode 3.5 out of 4 stars, writing, [...] "After last season's silly antics, the venerable dramedy pulls itself together for a clever final round." [...] He opined that Carlos and Susan's guilt helped keep the cover-up storyline compelling. The Hollywood Reporter Jethro Nededog was positive in his review of the episode, writing: [...] "It was a strong return, because it relied on the series’ strength, which is the bond these women have with each other." [...] Jamie Heller of The A.V. Club noted that [...] "there’s almost no other plot development" [...] in the episode apart from the cover-up and Lynette and Tom's separation.|$|E

2500|$|Alain Leroy Locke (September 13, 1885 – June 9, 1954) was an American writer, philosopher, educator, and {{patron of}} the arts.

As a result, popular listings of influential African Americans have repeatedly included him. On March 19, 1968, the Rev.

2500|$|Following infancy, the {{discrimination}} {{and production of}} facial expressions improves as toddlers grow into early childhood. At young ages, <b>children</b> <b>know</b> what the most common facial expressions look like (expressions of happiness or sadness), what they mean, {{and what kinds of}} situations typically elicit them. Children develop these skills at very early stages in life and continue to improve facial recognition, discrimination, and imitation between the ages of 3 and 10. One study showed that toddler's spontaneous facial expressions reflect the emotions shown by other toddlers, this is called [...] "decoding". This indicates that facial expressions are affected by the social environment, and are an important aspect in creating relationships with others in our social groups.|$|E

It’s important {{to listen to your}} children, accept your children and have your <b>children</b> <b>know</b> that you love them unconditionally. It’s not “I love you, but…”—there’s [...] no “but.” “It’s just “I love you.” … To do otherwise is—you’re hurting yourself, you’re going to shun your child or grandchild. You’re going to say, “No, I have my views and my views are the perfect views and no one can have a different point of view. I’m right and everything else is wrong.” And that’s a lonely way to live. It just means you’ll be out of that person’s life, and who wants to be cut out of their child’s life? ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{next step}} in the {{learning}} to read process is the novice reading stage [...] also known as selective association. [...] This begins with the child learning to decode print and understanding the meaning of what has been decoded. To do this, the child must first figure out the Alphabetic principle and master it in only a few years. Most <b>children</b> <b>know</b> that the words on a page in a book mean something, but do not readily understand how the letters code the meaning. [...] They know that these words are made of the sounds of their particular language, and that letters convey these sounds. [...] Novice readers learn to hear and manipulate the smaller sounds into syllables and words. If a child is able to master this skill, called phonological awareness, {{it is one of the}} best predictors of a child's success in learning to read. One way that you can teach children to become more aware of sounds within words is through such things as nursery rhymes that enhance the child's ability to hear and divide the structure of words. [...] Another way to teach a child to read is through little [...] "games" [...] in which the sounds in word are either clapped, written or danced to a beat. A novice reader will also memorize the most common letter patterns in their own language and most of the frequent words that will not necessarily follow the phonological rules such as in English the words [...] "have" [...] and [...] "who". It is in this stage that children will develop a vocabulary of words that is between 2,500 and 5,000 words. Children's vocabularies continue to grow as they enter elementary school, since they will continue to learn new words at a rate of about seven words per day. This shows that at this stage in reading the best piece of advice is to just practice, practice, practice or read, read more, and read again.|$|E
