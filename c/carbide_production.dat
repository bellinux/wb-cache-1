40|$|This master thesis in Industrial Ecology {{has been}} carried out at Royal Institute of Technology, KTH, in {{cooperation}} with Swedish Environmental Research Institute, IVL andShandong University. It discusses the air pollution control techniques in calcium carbidemanufacturing by studying Inner Mongolia Haiji Chlor-Alkali Chemical Co. Ltd’s plants inWuhai, Inner Mongolia, China. China’s environmental situation is discussed and its severe state is found to be similar to the western world in the last century. One of the main reasons for the air pollution problems arethe coal based industries in cities like Wuhai. Calcium carbide is a chemical based on coaland limestone which in China is mainly used for PVC plastics production. The emission from the <b>carbide</b> <b>production</b> is mainly particulate matter. This is suggested to be controlled by adding cyclone and electrostatic precipitator as treatment for the waste gas. Investments in particulate matter control will be at least a few million SEK (similar in RMB),but the waste, both the solid and the gas, can be used in other processes, namely cementproduction, heat exchanging and as fuel. By investing in equipment to use this waste and sell the energy, it is expected that close to ten million RMB 1 can be earned annually, meaning that the particulate matter control investment will pay off quickly. The Fischer-Tropschmethod for producing synthetic diesel from carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas provides another opportunity to use the waste gas. www. ima. kth. s...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} thermodynamic {{modeling of}} carbides in multicomponent systems. Focus {{has been made}} on systems interesting for cemented <b>carbide</b> <b>production</b> but the results are also useful for many other application were the material consist of different carbides, for example tool steels/high speed steels. The Co-W-C system forms the basis in cemented <b>carbide</b> <b>production.</b> An accurate thermodynamic description of this system is therefore crucial for extrapolation into higher order systems. New experimental results on the liquid+fcc+graphite+WC and liquid+fcc+WC+M 6 C equilibrium temperatures, that has recently been published, shows that these equilibrium temperatures are higher than the values used in the available assessment of Co-W-C. Since an accurate description of these equilibrium temperatures are very important for production of cemented carbides and when extrapolating into higher order systems a reassessment of the Co-W-C system is presented. Cr is sometimes deliberately added to lower the melting point, reduce grain growth and/or increase corrosion resistance {{in the production of}} cemented carbides. When adding chromium there is a risk of forming an unwanted M 7 C 3 carbide. It is therefore of great interest to know the stability of this carbide. New experimental results on the maximum solubility of Co in the M 7 C 3 is presented as well as a new thermodynamic description of the Co-Cr-C system which accurately describes the solubility of Co in the M 7 C 3 carbide in the temperature range 1373 - 1723 K. The assessment of a system, and the determination of Gibbs energy functions, is straightforward when reliable and consistent thermochemical and phase equilibrium information is available. However, reliable experimental information is often lacking or does not give a unique set of model parameters, and therefore different strategies to estimate information have been developed. In the present work the excess energies for A 1 -xBxC mixed carbides (where A and B are metals) have been calculated using ab-initio calculations, for 14 systems. A thorough comparison has been made with experimentally assessed excess energies. The comparison shows that ab-initio calculations can be used to predict the sign, magnitude and symmetry of the excess energy for A 1 -xBxC mixed carbides. The calculated excess energies have also successfully been used to describe several AC-BC systems where the experimental information does not give a unique determination of the excess energy in traditional CALPHAD modeling. Experimental work has also been done on the C-Co-Ti-V-W-Zr system {{in order to determine the}} extension of the miscibility gaps in TiC-ZrC and VC-ZrC into the (TiC or VC) -ZrC-WC system. Thermodynamic calculations were used to design samples that will form a miscibility gap in equilibrium with liquid, WC and graphite. Samples were produced from powder and sintered for 1 week in controlled atmosphere at 1300, 1410 and 1500 °C. From the microstructure it could be concluded that the samples form a miscibility gap in equilibrium with liquid, WC and graphite at all temperatures. The composition of the MCx carbides was measured using an analytic SEM. The new experimental information was used to assess the thermodynamic description for the TiC-ZrC system...|$|E
40|$|Silicon carbide is a versatile, useful, manmade material. It {{is made by}} {{blending}} coke {{and sand}} and applying heat. The North American market has grown significantly while {{a large part of}} it is now imported. The major users of silicon carbide grain are the abrasive, refractory, and alloy industry. The iron foundry industry uses a significant amount of silicon carbide in the form of refractories and alloy additions. Trends in the market point to stable to slightly decreasing pricing for SiC in the near future. Silicon <b>Carbide</b> <b>Production</b> Silicon carbide is a black to green material that is a combination of 70 % silicon and 30 % carbon. In nature, only a small amount exists, where coal and sand have been exposed {{to each other in the}} presence of a significant amount of hear. No commercially viable deposits exist, so for practical use, the material is manufactured. To make silicon carbide, usually low sulfur petroleum coke and high purity sand are selected as the raw materials. In some cases, coal is used in place of petroleum coke, though this tends to have a negative affect on properties as well as pollution problems. The standard method for producing SiC is in a electrical resistance furnace. The coke and sand are mixed together and an electric current is run through the material. The resistance of the blend creates a significant amount of heat that drives the reaction: 2 SiO 2 + 3 C + heat = 2 SiC + CO (Gas) The core of the arc will generate the highest purity silicon carbide, with the further from the arc, the lower the grade becomes...|$|E

Ultra-rapid synthesis has been achieved through the development of a reproducible experimental technique and the investigation into a plethora of reaction variables as well as microwave applicators and powers. This resulted in, specifically within the single mode cavity, the completion of the majority of reactions within 20 s. Further development was then built upon the direct relationship observed between phase fraction results (obtained from Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXD) data), in-situ temperature and ex-situ dielectric property measurements; allowing reaction profiles of the various carbides to be mapped, as well as a crucial understanding of the effects of microwave energy on materials at various temperatures. Powder Neutron Diffraction (PND) was also used to evaluate product purity and the C occupancy of the final products, revealing non-stoichiometry which relates directly to the Tc onset observed for the superconducting transition metal carbides. This, in turn, allowed the trends observed for the ternary carbides to be explained, a linear trend does not exist between Tc and C occupancy. In an effort to develop on the understanding of solid state microwave heating, in-situ reaction monitoring techniques were investigated. Through the use of thermal imaging and high speed photography, the W-C system was observed during the crucial initial stages of the reaction process. The information obtained both corroborated previously collected data and allowed a possible reaction mechanism to be alluded to. The observation of localised heating, prior to the beginning of carbide formation, suggests possible high temperatures far exceeding those observed by optical pyrometry. This could well explain the rapid reaction times as well as suggest an interaction mechanism between carbon, an efficient microwave absorber, and tungsten, a low dielectric loss metal...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} the rapid microwave synthesis {{of a number of}} transition metal carbides and nitrides as well as their structural characterization and develop reproducible procedures that can cut processing times and, hence, reduce the energy consumption. Specifically, 4 binary systems are investigated: V–C, Zr–C, Hf–C and Zr–N. Carbide syntheses were conducted using either elemental or oxide precursors under argon, whereas the nitride system was investigated from zirconium powder under either nitrogen or ammonia gas. Microwave syntheses were conducted using both multi-mode cavity (MMC) and single- mode cavity (SMC) microwave reactors at a power of 800 W and 1 kW, respectively, with an operating microwave frequency of 2. 45 GHz. Vanadium <b>carbide</b> <b>production</b> from both oxide and elemental precursors was achieved in 6 minutes for MMC experiments and 2 minutes for SMC experiments. Zirconium carbide was obtained from zirconium powder and graphite in 20 minutes in a MMC reactor and 6 minutes in a SMC reactor. Unfortunately, the carbothermal reduction of ZrO 2 to ZrC was not successful as the starting materials did not react with each other and no product formation was observed. Similar results were obtained for the carburization of HfO 2. However, hafnium carbide was synthesized combining graphite with hafnium metal in 20 minutes in a MMC reactor and 6 minutes in a SMC reactor but the formation of additional oxide phases (i. e. HfO 2) was also observed. Finally, zirconium nitride production was investigated in a MMC reactor and prepared in 20 minutes from zirconium metal under either N 2 or NH 3 gas. Generally, oxygen inclusion was observed in all experiments either in the form of oxycarbide or additional oxide phase(s). Once a reproducible experimental technique was established, products were characterized by several analytical techniques. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was used to identify product phases, study the phase evolution of the microwave processes and refine the MW-synthesized structures by Rietveld method. Powder neutron diffraction (PND) was used on the V-C and Zr-C samples to evaluate product purity and the C and O occupancies of the final products. Scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) provided information about product morphology, particle size and purity. EDX supported the evidence for oxygen inclusion across samples. Supporting information in favour of this was additionally offered by Raman spectroscopy.
