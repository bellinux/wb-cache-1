40|$|The figure {{depicts a}} {{miniature}} cantilever-type anemometer {{that has been}} developed as a prototype of compact, relatively nonintrusive anemometers that can function at temperatures up to 600 C {{and that can be}} expected to be commercially mass-producible at low cost. The design of this anemometer, and especially the packaging aspect of the design, is intended to enable measurement of turbulence in the high-temperature, high-vibration environment of a turbine engine or in any similar environment. The main structural components of the anemometer include a single-crystal SiC cantilever and two polycrystalline SiC clamping plates, all made from chemical-vapor-deposited silicon carbide. Fabrication of these components from the same basic material eliminates thermal-expansion mismatch, which has introduced spurious thermomechanical stresses in cantilever-type anemometers of prior design. The clamping plates are heavily oxidized to improve electrical insulation at high temperature. A cavity that serves as a receptacle for the clamped end of the cantilever is etched into one end of one <b>clamping</b> <b>plate.</b> Trenches that collectively constitute a socket for a multipin electrical plug (for connection to external electronic circuitry) are etched into the opposite end of this <b>clamping</b> <b>plate.</b> Metal strips for electrical contact are deposited on one face of the other <b>clamping</b> <b>plate.</b> Piezoresistive single-crystal SiC thin-film strain gauges are etched in the n-type SiC epilayer in a Wheatstone-bridge configuration. Metal contact pads on the cantilever that extend into the clamping-receptacle area, are obtained by deposition and patterning using standard semiconductor photolithography and etching methods. The cantilever and the two clamping plates are assembled into a sandwich structure that is then clamped in a stainless-steel housing. The Wheatstone- bridge carrying SiC cantilever with the metal contact pads on the piezoresistors is slid into the receptacle in the bottom <b>clamping</b> <b>plate.</b> The top <b>clamping</b> <b>plate</b> is brought into contact with the bottom plate so that the narrow section of the metal strips on the top clamp plate aligns with the metal contact pads on the cantilever. When the parts are clamped together, the metal strips provide electrical connections between the Wheatstone-bridge contact points and the sides the trenches that constitute the socket for the multipin electrical plug. Hence, to connect the Wheatstone bridge to external circuitry for processing of the anemometer readout, one need only insert the plug in the socket. In operation, the cantilever end of the stainless-steel housing is mounted flush with an engine wall and the unclamped portion of the cantilever is exposed into the flow. The cantilever is deflected in direct proportion to the force induced by component of flow parallel to the engine wall and perpendicular to the broad exposed face of the cantilever. The maximum strain on the cantilever occurs at the clamped edge and is measured by the piezoresistors, which are located there. The corresponding changes in resistance manifest themselves in the output of the Wheatstone bridge...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{investigate}} universal inequalities for eigenvalues of a <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem on a bounded domain in an n-dimensional hyper-bolic space. It {{is well known}} that, for a bounded domain in the n-dimensional Euclidean space, Payne, Pólya and Weinberger (1955), Hook (1990) and Chen and Qian (1990) studied universal inequalities for eigenvalues of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem. Recently, Cheng and Yang (2006) have derived the Yang-type universal inequality for eigenvalues of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem on a bounded domain in the n-dimensional Euclidean space, which is sharper than the other ones. For a domain in a unit sphere, Wang and Xia (2007) have also given a universal inequality for eigenvalues. For a bounded domain in the n-dimensional hyperbolic space, although many mathematicians want to obtain a universal inequality for eigenvalues of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem, there are no results on universal inequalities for eigenvalues. The main reason that one could not derive a universal inequality is that one cannot find appropriate trial functions. In this paper, by constructing “nice ” trial functions, we obtain a universal inequality for eigenvalues of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem on a bounded domain in the hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we can prove that if the first eigenvalue of the <b>clamped</b> <b>plate</b> problem tends to (n− 1) 4 16 when the domain tends to the hyperbolic space, then all of the eigenvalues tend t...|$|R

40|$|Abstract only availableDue to {{the rising}} number of {{explosion}} attacks, the need for blast resistant structures has increased greatly. Many materials have been tested for blast retrofit design but have shown to have limitation. The focus {{of this research is}} on the analysis of using steel sheets as a method for retrofit design. These sheets are thin and take up little space, have a large amount of energy absorption capability, and the installation process is quick and easy to perform in the field. For optimum blast retrofit design, the development of the sheathing's full capacity is controlled by its connection capacity. Structures, such as CMU walls, with low resistance to blast loading and that fail under external pressure of approximately 0. 30 psi can benefit from these retrofit sheathings that increase the wall system's ductility and energy absorption. A CMU wall retrofitted with such method can resist blast loads as high as 40 psi. The tests results are used to develop design recommendation for improved performance. The axial tension that the samples will be subjected to is meant to simulate how steel sheets would react when resisting a blast load on a structure. The energy absorbed from the tests is found after plotting the pressure-displacement graphs of each sample, and then calculating the area under the curve. The parameters that are varied in these tests include two different <b>clamping</b> <b>plate</b> thicknesses, and alterations to the steel sheets. The <b>clamping</b> <b>plate</b> design is also varied to prevent premature failure at the sharp edges and corners.

30|$|The {{connecting}} element {{is the key}} part to make steel supports yieldable. The steel support should maintain certain resistance force when it retracts, which can not only accommodate some rock deformation, but also restrain too large rock deformation to keep roadways stable. To meet the requirements mentioned above, the mechanical performance of the {{connecting element}} is very important. Any connecting element contains a lock unit and a friction unit. The lock unit binds the overlapping part of two segments in the support and offers compressive force. When the steel support overcomes the frictions between two segments of U-shaped steel and the connecting element, it will retract. According to the locking units, the connecting elements {{can be divided into}} bolt and wedge types. Bolt connecting elements can be subdivided into three types: a U-shaped bolt with <b>clamping</b> <b>plate,</b> double U-shaped clamping plates, and pushing bolt. Wedge connecting elements can also be subdivided into three types: wedge block (single-wedge or two-wedges), ear-shaped wedge, and buckled wedge.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis article {{presents}} a surface reconstruction model {{based on a}} methodology developed for the prediction of cutting forces in free-form milling. From global and local geometry of the tool, initial surface and tool path, this approach allows us to predict cutting forces and now surface form and roughness directly from CAM data. Good results were observed even for complex ball-end milling operations {{and the idea is}} to make benefit from the fine geometrical description developed for tool-workpiece engagement calculation to deduce the resultant cut surface. The principle is firstly to store the calculation points coming from the discretization of the cutting tool and identified as engaged in the workpiece material. The second step is to consider a regular grid in plane (X,Y) and to keep the lower points in each created column in order to obtain a Z-Map surface. The procedure of point's determination, recording and filtering is presented. Moreover, some results are discussed and compared to metrological data.
