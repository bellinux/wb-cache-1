Congress subsequently made a $30,000 appropriation {{at the end of}} 1865 to pay for the general refurbishment of the house (which included the china and silver replacements). The administration replaced the entire [...] "solferino" [...] china set with an identical set on January 17, 1866, also manufactured by Haviland and decorated by E. V. Haughwout and Company. This china is different from the 1861 set, as both the outline and the colors were done by hand (no stencil was used). [...] This second order of [...] "Lincoln china" [...] consisted of 391 pieces, and included pickle dishes, custard cups, egg cups, serving dishes of various depths, compote dishes, sugar bowls, baskets, butter dishes, dinner plates, dessert plates, tea plates, soup plates, preserve plates, breakfast coffee cups, regular coffee cups, tea <b>cups,</b> <b>water</b> pitchers, and one salad bowl, cake plate, and ice bowl. There is little documentary evidence, but oral tradition claims that E.V. Haughwout contracted with Edward Lycett, the most famous china painter in the United States at the time, to decorate the china. Glassware was also reordered from Haughwout & Co. in 1866, and manufactured by the New England Glass Co. of Cambridge, Massachusetts.|$|E

40|$|Background The ¯avonoid {{components}} of tea {{have been associated}} in epidemiological studies with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. Flavonoids {{have been shown to}} have antioxidant and vasodilator effects in vitro; we therefore postulated that drinking green or black tea attenuates the well-characterized acute pressor response to caffeine and lowers blood pressure during regular consumption. Objective To determine whether green and black tea can attenuate the transient pressor effect of caffeine, or lower blood pressure during regular consumption. Methods In the ®rst study, the acute effects of four hot drinks ± green tea and black tea (at a dose equivalent to four standard <b>cups),</b> <b>water</b> matched to the teas for caffeine content (`caffeine') and water ± were assessed in 2...|$|E

50|$|Soak the ham in four <b>cups</b> of <b>water</b> {{for about}} three hours to {{dissolve}} some of the salt. Discard the water.
