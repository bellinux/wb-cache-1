5000|$|A popular view {{within the}} UK is that Britons are {{relatively}} generous {{with regards to}} helping others alleviate poverty and hunger. There are numerous surveys that suggest this is at least partially true, {{but it was not}} always the case. In the 19th century, the UK became the world's first country where a view became dominant that it is best to leave the hungry to fend for themselves. Up until the late 18th century, the attitude towards hunger was similar to that found else where: that hunger is something which affluent people should seek to relieve when they have the means available, but also that famine is not something that societies can be expected to avoid or overcome. Within Christendom, famines were sometimes even seen as divine punishments. Towards the end of the 18th century, improvements in technology, the economy and bureaucratic procedures were laying the foundation for what would eventually emerge as the nation state. Some, such as prime minister Lord Pitt, took the view that the State should use its growing power to intervene against hunger. [...] Others, such as liberal economists like Adam Smith took the view that government intervention would be counter productive; {{that in the long run}} only the free market could produce sustained plenty for all. Other very different but allied views for opposing hunger relief which arose in the late 18th century included Malthus's position that starvation was the only reliable way to <b>check</b> <b>run</b> away population growth, and Townsend's view that hunger was a useful motivational condition, which taught [...] "decency and civility, obedience and subjection, to the most brutish, the most obstinate, and the most perverse." [...] The growing movement against hunger relief was supported even by some evangelical Christians, who had come to view hunger as evidence of punishment for sin, with the hungry best left to redeem themselves through their own hard work. Until the early 1830s, Lord Pitt and others who favored government intervention largely retained control over policy, even if they had to compromise with those who opposed generous relief measures.|$|E

40|$|Almost all timber in Ireland is {{harvested}} using {{mechanical harvesting}} heads. All new harvesters come equipped with computerized measurement systems. The {{objective of the}} research reported in this article {{was to assess the}} impact of calibration on the accuracy of harvester head measurement systems in Irish forestry conditions. The research was carried out on a site in Co. Cork. The harvester was a Timberjack 1270 D with a 762 C harvester head and the Timbermatic 300 control and measurement system. The harvester measurement system was assessed on its accuracy in measuring the length and volume of individual stems and logs in 9 check runs of 7 or 8 stems. The harvester head measurements were compared to values obtained by caliper-and-tape measurements. The main point that can be taken from this research is that regular calibration will greatly improve the accuracy of the harvester measurement system. After calibration, length measurement by the harvester measurement system of individual logs was very accurate, while volume measurement was unsatisfactory for the pulp log assortment. The differences between the harvester measurements and the caliper-and-tape measurements fluctuated greatly, varying from positive to negative differences within a <b>check</b> <b>run,</b> even after calibration. These fluctuations could indicate an inherent problem associated with the design of the calibration procedure, as the positive and negative differences cancel each other out and the calibration, based on mean values, appears to indicate accurate measurements.

40|$|Abstract. Embedded {{software}} verification {{is an important}} verification problem that requires the ability to reason about the timed semantics of concurrent behaviors at {{a low level of}} atomicity. The level of atomicity is the smallest execution block (such as a machine instruction or a C instruction) that cannot be split by an interrupt. Combining a cycleaccurate debugger with model checking algorithms provides an accurate model of software execution at the machine-code level while supporting concurrency and allowing abstractions to manage state explosion. We report on the design and implementation of such a model checker using the GNU debugger (gdb) with different processor backends. A significant feature of the resulting tool is that we can adjust the level of atomicity during the model <b>checking</b> <b>run</b> to reduce state explosion while focusing on behaviors that are likely to generate an error. ...|$|R
