5|$|The <b>Corded</b> Ware culture, in {{existence}} in central Europe between 3000 and 2000 BCE, originated most likely from Proto-Indo-European nomadic {{people of the}} Black Sea steppes. It was a pastoral culture at least in its early stages, {{for the most part}} lacking permanent settlements and known primarily from the burial grounds (a large one with many richly furnished graves was discovered in Złota near Sandomierz). They moved together with their herds of cattle, sheep, goats and horses along the river valleys of southern Poland, but also engaged in flint mining and manufacturing of tools and weapons for their own use and trade.|$|E
5000|$|Other non-official {{terms for}} {{firewood}} volume include standing <b>cord,</b> kitchen <b>cord,</b> running <b>cord,</b> face <b>cord,</b> fencing <b>cord,</b> country <b>cord,</b> long <b>cord,</b> and rick, all subject to local variation. These are usually taken {{to mean a}} well-stacked pile of wood in which the logs are shorter or longer than in a legal <b>cord,</b> to accommodate various burners. For example, a face <b>cord</b> commonly consists of wood that is 16 in long.

50|$|A plastic <b>cord</b> lock (also {{known as}} <b>cord</b> fastener, plastic stopper or <b>cord</b> toggle) {{attaches}} to drawstrings and tightens {{without the use}} of knots. <b>Cord</b> locks allow mountaineers to fasten clothing and camping equipment quickly in cold conditions when the fingers are encased in heavy gloves. They consist generally of three parts: a barrel, a toggle (plunger), and a spring. Squeezed together, tension is released and the <b>cord</b> lock can move freely up and down the <b>cords.</b> Released, the tension is engaged and the <b>cord</b> lock stays in place.

5|$|The Rzucewo culture (named {{after the}} village near Puck where the discoveries took place) {{developed}} from northern {{populations of the}} <b>Corded</b> Ware culture as an offshoot specialized in exploitation of the sea resources and lasted in parallel with their mother culture for a comparable period of time. Their settlements consisting of characteristic sea erosion reinforced houses were located along the Bay of Gdańsk and east of there. They engaged in fishery and hunting, especially of seals, then numerous along the Baltic coast. The Rzucewo culture people produced in special shops the widely used and traded amber decorative items.|$|E
5|$|Petticoats made of {{horsehair}} crinoline appeared around 1839, proving {{so successful}} that the name 'crinoline' began to refer to supportive petticoats in general, rather than solely to the material. By 1847, crinoline fabric was {{being used as a}} stiffening for skirt linings, although English women preferred separate crinoline fabric petticoats which were beginning to collapse under the increasing weight of the skirts. One alternative to horsehair crinoline was the quilted petticoat stuffed with down or feathers, such as that reportedly worn in 1842 by Lady Aylesbury. However, quilted skirts were not widely produced until the early 1850s. In about 1849, it was possible to buy stiffened and <b>corded</b> cotton fabric for making petticoats, marketed as 'crinoline,' and designed as a substitute for the horsehair textile. The artificial crinoline with hoops did not emerge until the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|Sex {{therapist}} Ruth Westheimer {{said the}} device was most favored by those selecting from vibrators of the <b>corded</b> electrical variety. Therapist and sex educator Laura Berman recommended the device in many articles for the Chicago Sun-Times, both for women who had never experienced an orgasm {{and those who had}} difficulty becoming aroused. Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth about Sex, a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that the Magic Wand was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian clinical psychologist and sex therapist Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using the Magic Wand while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse. Physician and sex columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the Magic Wand in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if they felt it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device. Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists.|$|E

25|$|The Bell Beaker {{culture is}} {{understood}} as not only a particular pottery type, but also a complete and complex cultural phenomenon involving metalwork in copper, gold and later bronze, archery, specific types of ornamentation and shared ideological, cultural and religious ideas. The Bell Beaker period marks a period of cultural contact in Atlantic and Western Europe on a scale not seen previously, nor seen again in succeeding periods. It can be seen initially as the western equivalent of the contemporary <b>Corded</b> Ware culture, though from c. 2400 BC Bell Beaker expanded eastwards over parts of Central and Eastern Europe where <b>Corded</b> Ware previously thrived. Thus in parts of Central and Eastern Europe, as far east as Poland, there is a sequence from <b>Corded</b> Ware to Bell Beaker, {{but this is not}} the case in Iberia, France or the British Isles, where <b>Corded</b> Ware is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of the Late Neolithic Period about 2200 BC {{is characterized by the}} appearance of the <b>Corded</b> Ware culture, pottery with <b>corded</b> decoration and well-polished stone axes (s.c. boat-shape axes).

40|$|Introduction. To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} complex umbilical <b>cord</b> entanglement primarily around the trunk on pregnancy outcomes. Methods. We studied 6307 pregnant women with singleton pregnancies who underwent vaginal delivery of an infant at ≥ 37 weeks of gestation. Cases were classified into no <b>cord,</b> nuchal <b>cord,</b> and body <b>cord</b> groups and defined as cases without umbilical <b>cord</b> entanglement, one or more loops of the umbilical <b>cord</b> around the neck only, and umbilical <b>cord</b> around the trunk only, respectively. Pregnancy outcomes were compared among these three groups. Results. The no <b>cord,</b> nuchal <b>cord,</b> and body <b>cord</b> group included 4733, 1451, and 123 pregnancies, respectively. Although delivery mode was not significantly different among the three groups, 1 -minute Apgar scores < 7 and umbilical artery (UA) pH < 7. 10 were significantly {{more common in the}} umbilical <b>cord</b> entanglement groups than in the no <b>cord</b> group. In particular, the frequency of 5 -minute Apgar scores < 7 was significantly higher (P= 0. 004), whereas that of UA pH < 7. 10 tended to be higher (P= 0. 057) in the body <b>cord</b> group than in the nuchal <b>cord</b> group. Conclusion. Compared to nuchal <b>cord,</b> umbilical <b>cord</b> entanglement around the trunk was associated with a higher risk of low Apgar scores and low UA pH...|$|R
50|$|Umbilical <b>cord</b> length - A short {{umbilical}} <b>cord</b> (<30 cm) {{can affect}} the fetus in that fetal movements can cause <b>cord</b> compression, constriction and ruptures.

5000|$|<b>Cord</b> blood banking {{refers to}} the {{collection}} at birth, processing, testing, cryopreservation and storage of stem cells from the umbilical <b>cord</b> blood. <b>Cord</b> blood, also called [...] "placental blood", is blood that remains in the umbilical <b>cord</b> and placenta following {{the birth of a}} baby and after the umbilical <b>cord</b> is cut. During pregnancy, the umbilical <b>cord</b> functions as a lifeline between mother and child. After a baby's delivery, the <b>cord</b> blood present in the umbilical <b>cord</b> could offer hope for the child or members of the family. <b>Cord</b> blood is a rich source of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are primarily responsible for replenishing blood and regenerating the immune system.|$|R
25|$|Umbilical <b>cord</b> {{compression}} {{can result}} from, for example, entanglement of the <b>cord,</b> a knot in the <b>cord,</b> or a nuchal <b>cord,</b> (which is the wrapping of the umbilical <b>cord</b> around the fetal neck) but these conditions {{do not always}} cause obstruction of fetal circulation.|$|R

25|$|The Sintashta culture {{emerged from}} the {{interaction}} of two antecedent cultures. Its immediate predecessor in the Ural-Tobol steppe was the Poltavka culture, {{an offshoot of the}} cattle-herding Yamnaya horizon that moved east into the region between 2800 and 2600 BCE. Several Sintashta towns were built over older Poltovka settlements or close to Poltovka cemeteries, and Poltovka motifs are common on Sintashta pottery. Sintashta material culture also shows the influence of the late Abashevo culture, a collection of <b>Corded</b> Ware settlements in the forest steppe zone north of the Sintashta region that were also predominantly pastoralist.

40|$|SummaryThe {{incidence}} of placenta and umbilical <b>cord</b> abnormalities {{is high in}} abnormal course of the delivery. Although the detection rate of umbilical <b>cord</b> abnormalities is steadily increasing with the improvement of ultrasound technology, {{and the fact that}} ultrasound scanning can distinguish umbilical <b>cord</b> conditions, this information has not exerted much impact on the management of labor to date. We believe prenatal detection of umbilical <b>cord</b> abnormalities must reduce the number of emergent cesarean sections and intrauterine fetal death. In this review, we describe the ultrasound diagnosis and management of major umbilical <b>cord</b> abnormalities, including abnormalities of <b>cord</b> insertion site (velamentous and marginal <b>cord</b> insertion), hypercoiled <b>cord</b> and nuchal <b>cord,</b> considering the current knowledge on physiologic and pathologic aspects of each umbilical <b>cord</b> abnormality...|$|R

40|$|During aortic surgery, {{interruption}} of spinal <b>cord</b> blood flow might cause spinal <b>cord</b> ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). The incidence of spinal <b>cord</b> IRI after aortic surgery {{is up to}} 28 %, and patients with spinal <b>cord</b> IRI might suffer from postoperative paraplegia or paraparesis. Spinal <b>cord</b> IRI includes two phases. The immediate spinal <b>cord</b> injury is related to acute ischemia. And the delayed spinal <b>cord</b> injury involves both ischemic cellular death and reperfusion injury. Inflammation is a subsequent event of spinal <b>cord</b> ischemia and possibly {{a major contributor to}} spinal <b>cord</b> IRI. However, the development of inflammatory mediators is incompletely demonstrated. And treatments available for inflammation in spinal <b>cord</b> IRI are insufficient. Improved understanding about spinal <b>cord</b> IRI and the development of inflammatory cells and cytokines in this process will provide novel therapeutic strategies for spinal <b>cord</b> IRI. Inflammatory cytokines (e. g., TNF-α and IL- 1) may {{play an important role in}} spinal <b>cord</b> IRI. For treatment of several intractable autoimmune diseases (e. g., rheumatoid arthritis), where inflammatory cytokines are involved in disease progression, anti-inflammatory cytokine antagonist is now available. Hence, there is great potential of anti-inflammatory cytokine antagonist for therapeutic use of spinal <b>cord</b> IRI.

40|$|The {{aggregation}} of mycobacterial {{cells in}} a definite order, forming microscopic structures that resemble <b>cords,</b> {{is known as}} <b>cord</b> formation, or <b>cording,</b> and is considered a virulence factor in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and the species Mycobacterium marinum. In the 1950 s, <b>cording</b> was related to a trehalose dimycolate lipid that, consequently, was named the <b>cord</b> factor. However, modern techniques of microbial genetics have revealed that <b>cording</b> can be affected by mutations in genes not directly involved in trehalose dimycolate biosynthesis. Therefore, questions such as “How does mycobacterial <b>cord</b> formation occur?” and “Which molecular factors {{play a role in}} <b>cord</b> formation?” remain unanswered. At present, one of the problems in <b>cording</b> studies is the correct interpretation of <b>cording</b> morphology. Using optical microscopy, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between <b>cording</b> and clumping, which is a general property of mycobacteria due to their hydrophobic surfaces. In this work, we provide a new way to visualize <b>cords</b> in great detail using scanning electron microscopy, and we show the first scanning electron microscopy images of the ultrastructure of mycobacterial <b>cords,</b> making this technique the ideal tool for <b>cording</b> studies. This technique has enabled us to affirm that nonpathogenic mycobacteria also form microscopic <b>cords.</b> Finally, we demonstrate that a strong correlation exists between microscopic <b>cords,</b> rough colonial morphology, and increased persistence of mycobacteria inside macrophages...|$|R
