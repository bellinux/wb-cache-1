25|$|Walker Volcanics {{appear as}} purple or greenish-grey dacitic ignimbrite. These volcanics contain chloritised <b>cordierite</b> {{and some have}} garnet. They are Wenlock age.

25|$|Hawkins Volcanics is a green-grey dacite or dacitic tuff. These volcanics contain chloritised <b>cordierite,</b> {{and some}} have garnet. Their age is Ludlow to Wenlock.

25|$|This {{was named}} after Mount Painter in Canberra by Öpik, however he called it a porphyry. The {{description}} is a massive dark bluish-grey dacitic crystal tuff containing garnet and chloritised <b>cordierite.</b> There is a local appearance of agglomerate and pumice. There are prominent quartz and feldspar phenocrysts.|$|E
25|$|The Vohimena {{mountains}} {{dominate the}} Tolagnaro region. They terminate just outside Tolagnaro at Bezavona (Pic St. Louis) which is 529 m. Bedrock inland is granite. At Point Evatraha and near Mandena it is <b>cordierite</b> gneiss. There is an external barrier dune complex {{along the coast}} which runs north, up the entire east coast. Between northern Mandena north to Manafiafy (Saint Luce), there are heavy mineral deposits of ilmenite, zircon, rutile and monazite, with these mineralized sands averaging 18 m. thick in the Mandena region. There are also similar deposits {{at the south end}} of Petriky (west of Vinanibe).|$|E
25|$|Danish {{archaeologist}} Thorkild Ramskou {{posited that}} the sunstone {{could have been}} one of the minerals (<b>cordierite</b> or Iceland spar) that polarize light and by which the azimuth of the sun can be determined in a partly overcast sky or when the sun is just below the horizon. The principle is used by many animals and polar flights applied the idea before more advanced techniques became available. Ramskou further conjectured that the sunstone could have aided navigation in the open sea in the Viking period. This idea has become very popular, and research as to how a sunstone could be used in nautical navigation continues.|$|E
25|$|Tourmalines have a {{very complex}} {{chemistry}} that can be described by a general formula XY3Z6(BO3)3T6O18V3W. The T6O18 is the basic ring structure, where T is usually Si4+, but substitutable by Al3+ or B3+. Tourmalines can be subgrouped by the occupancy of the X site, and from there further subdivided by the chemistry of the W site. The Y and Z sites can accommodate a variety of cations, especially various transition metals; this variability in structural transition metal content gives the tourmaline group greater variability in colour. Other cyclosilicates include beryl, Al2Be3Si6O18, whose varieties include the gemstones emerald (green) and aquamarine (bluish). <b>Cordierite</b> is structurally similar to beryl, and is a common metamorphic mineral.|$|E
25|$|Named after Mount Ainslie, Australian Capital Territory {{where their}} type {{location}} occurs, the Ainslie Volcanics {{are composed of}} Dacitic ignimbrite and minor volcaniclastic and argillaceous sediments. The lithology is bluish grey dacitic tuff, which can be massive or foliated, also dacitic agglomerate and shale. These volcanics contain chloritised <b>cordierite</b> and some have red almandine garnet. Jasper is found on low hills {{on the north side}} of the Molonglo River. The thickness is at least 700 metres. The magma was formed by melting an aluminiumrich pelitic sediment. The eruption came from a volcano into shallow sea water. The deposits built above sea level as they progressed. The underlying sediments now make up the Canberra Formation. Between Hall and Namina Hill on Spring Range, the Mount Painter Volcanics lie unconformably on top.|$|E
2500|$|... {{sedimentary}} formations - includes sediments {{deposited in}} Silurian waters and metamorphosed during the Devonian period, {{as well as}} carbon and more recent sediments, resulting during the Quaternary. The first group includes principally schists and quartz-feldspar, greywackes and quartzites with meta-crystals, such as andalusite, <b>cordierite</b> and sillimanite. These sedminentary deposits are prominently preserved in two linear patches: Vale das Antas and Louriça, near Castro Laboreiro, between two granite structures. The most recent geological formations are those created by fluvial, torrential and glacial deposits.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, the Malagasy Government {{conducted}} aerial magnetic and radiometric {{surveys of}} the area, finding the amounts of Thorium and Uranium increased as one moves west, though this {{could be due to}} [...] "transported cover" [...] on the Easter side of the area. In 2007 drilling by the Canadian firm, Pan African Mining Corporation, at one site found [...] "high-grade uranium mineralisation grading 4,329 ppm uranium", with deposits as far down as 60 metres below the surface. In 2009–10 LP HILL began ground traverses for Thorium and Uranium in the Marodambo area (in addition they have permits to search for <b>Cordierite,</b> Garnets and Sapphires).|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} filter {{is made of}} <b>cordierite</b> (a ceramic {{material}} that is also used as catalytic converter supports (cores)). <b>Cordierite</b> filters provide excellent filtration efficiency, are relatively inexpensive, and have thermal properties that make packaging them for installation in the vehicle simple. The major drawback is that <b>cordierite</b> has a relatively low melting point (about 1200 °C) and <b>cordierite</b> substrates {{have been known to}} melt during filter regeneration. This is mostly an issue if the filter has become loaded more heavily than usual, and is more of an issue with passive systems than with active systems, unless there is a system break down.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cordierite</b> {{typically}} {{occurs in}} contact or regional metamorphism of pelitic rocks. It is especially common in hornfels produced by contact metamorphism of pelitic rocks. Two common metamorphic mineral assemblages include sillimanite-cordierite-spinel and cordierite-spinel-plagioclase-orthopyroxene. Other associated minerals include garnet (cordierite-garnet-sillimanite gneisses) and anthophyllite. <b>Cordierite</b> also occurs in some granites, pegmatites, and norites in gabbroic magmas. Alteration products include mica, chlorite, and talc. <b>Cordierite</b> occurs, for example, in the granite contact zone at Geevor Tin Mine in Cornwall.|$|E
50|$|Catalytic {{converters}} {{are commonly}} made from ceramics containing {{a large proportion}} of synthetic <b>cordierite.</b> The manufacturing process deliberately aligns the <b>cordierite</b> crystals {{to make use of the}} very low thermal expansion along one axis. This prevents thermal shock cracking from taking place when the catalytic converter is used.|$|E

50|$|The Cambro-Ordovician {{metamorphic}} rocks comprise migmatites of upper amphibolite facies grade, mica schists with andalusite, <b>cordierite</b> and staurolite of lower amphibolite facies grade, and phyllites of greenschist facies grade.|$|E
50|$|During the Variscan orogeny in the Pennsylvanian about 310 {{million years}} ago the sediments of the Canaveilles Group were metamorphosed under mesozonal {{conditions}} (amphibolite facies). The original shales transformed into mica schists of the <b>cordierite,</b> andalusite and sillimanite zone in {{the lower part of}} the section, higher up they only converted to greenschist facies phyllites of the biotite zone. The carbonaceous intercalations became marbles and calcsilicates. Close to the contact with the “transitional gneiss” first the andalusite isograd is reached, followed by the <b>cordierite</b> isograd. This indicates a magmatic origin of the gneisses formed from intrusive granitoids.|$|E
