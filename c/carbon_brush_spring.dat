40|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>brush</b> {{is a small}} block made {{of mostly}} carbon and {{graphite}} which {{is used as a}} current transmitter between stationary and moving part of electric generator or motor. <b>Carbon</b> <b>brush</b> is typically produced by using mineral graphite which is an allotropic form of carbon as the raw material beside the addition of fillers such as copper in order to enhance the mechanical ability of the <b>carbon</b> <b>brush.</b> In order to achieve a sustainable environment and good natural resources management for the future generation, the usage of graphite from natural resources for the fabrication of the <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> need to be reduce. This research is conducted in order to minimize the usage of the graphite as the raw material by replacing it with carbon from palm oil shell for the fabrication of <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> for railway application (Light Rail Transit).

40|$|A new precise {{chemical}} method {{has been developed}} for the compositional analysis of <b>carbon</b> <b>brush.</b> The major chemical constituents of <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> are <b>carbon</b> (C), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and tin (Sn), while the minor constituents are silica (SiO 2), iron (Fe), and molybdenum (Me). The analytical techniques employed for graphitic carbon, Pb, Sn, and SiO 2 analysis were gravimetry (Loss in ignition, as PbSO 4. as metastannic acid, and as SiO 2, respectively) and titremetry for copper (lodimetry). Trace impurities of Fe and Mo were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). On the same sample, gravimetric methods as above have been compared for Cu (as cuprous thiocyanate) by gravimetry and for Pb and Sn by normal titremetry (EDTA with xylenol orange as indicator). XRD confirmed the presence of graphitic <b>carbon</b> in <b>carbon</b> <b>brush.</b> The major constituents (w/w %) of <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> for Cu.

In this paper, data-mining algorithms are applied for early prediction of <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> faults. Predicting generator brush faults early enables timely maintenance or replacement of brushes. The results discussed in this paper are based on analyzing generator brush faults that occurred on 27 {{wind turbines}}. The datasets used to analyze faults were collected from the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems installed at the wind turbines. Twenty-four data-mining models are constructed to predict faults up to 12 h before the actual fault occurs. To increase the prediction accuracy of the models discussed, a data balancing approach is used. Four data-mining algorithms were studied to evaluate {{the quality of the}} models for predicting generator brush faults. Among the selected data-mining algorithms, the boosting tree algorithm provided the best prediction results. Research limitations attributed to the available datasets are discussed.
