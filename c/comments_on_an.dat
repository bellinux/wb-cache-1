[...] New Amsterdam, a short-lived drama which aired on Fox in 2008, featured a 400-year-old male NYPD detective and a female partner. [...] Miller stated {{that he had not}} heard about the series until he read some <b>comments</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> industry website. [...] Television critics also took notice of the similarities between New Amsterdam and Forever. USA Todays Robert Bianco thought that Forever took a [...] "smarter, lighter approach to the subject" [...] of immortality than New Amsterdam did. [...] Lowery, Roush, and Busis all noted the similarities between the two series in their reviews of Forever.|$|E

2500|$|Bertone, who was {{elevated}} {{to the rank}} of cardinal in 2003 and held the position of Vatican Secretary of State until September 2013, wrote a book in 2007 titled, The Last Secret of Fatima. The book contains a transcribed interview between journalist Giuseppe De Carli and Bertone in which Bertone responds to various criticisms and accusations regarding the content and disclosure of the Third Secret. At one point in the interview, De Carli <b>comments</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> unsourced accusation that the Vatican is concealing a one-page text of the Third Secret which predicts a great apostasy where Rome will [...] "lose the faith and become the throne of the Antichrist."

2500|$|He also <b>comments</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> {{interview}} he {{conducted in the}} late 1990s {{on the subject of}} paedophilia and child prostitution, in which he interviewed a 14-year-old boy (under the pseudonym [...] "Lee") who had had sex with older men, in some cases for money. In this interview, Tatchell makes various counterarguments against Lee's point of view, such as: [...] "How can a young child understand sex and give meaningful consent?", [...] "Perhaps your friends were particularly mature for their age. Most young people are not so sophisticated about sex", [...] "Many people worry that the power imbalance in a relationship between a youth and an adult means the younger person can be easily manipulated and exploited", [...] "Many people fear that making sex easier for under-age teenagers will expose them to dangers like HIV. Isn't that a legitimate worry?".|$|E
2500|$|Corry, Renn, and Stachel {{authored}} a {{joint reply}} to Winterberg, which they claimed Zeitschrift für Naturforschung refused to publish without [...] "unacceptable" [...] modifications, {{and unable to}} find a publisher [...] elsewhere, they made it available on the internet. The reply accused Winterberg of misrepresenting the reason why Science would not publish his paper (it {{had to do with the}} section of the journal it was scheduled to appear in), and also misrepresenting that the paper published in Zeitschrift für Naturforschung was the same paper he had submitted to Science, and had in fact been [...] "substantially altered" [...] after Winterberg had received their <b>comments</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> earlier draft. Actually, Winterberg in his Final Comment had clearly stated that the paper submitted to Science had been a previous version. [...] They then argue that Winterberg's interpretation of the Hilbert paper was incorrect, that the lost part of the page was unlikely to have been consequential, and that much of Winterberg's reasoning about what could be in the missing piece was incorrect (down to noting [...] Winterberg claims that 1/3 of the page was removed, when actually over half a page is missing total from the two cut off pages) and internally inconsistent. They further argued there was a likely [...] "non-paranoid" [...] explanation for the missing part of the page.|$|E
