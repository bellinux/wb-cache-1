The record is composed of the Vrica-Crotone section (Calabria, southern Italy) and the Montalbano Jonico section (Basilicata, southern Italy). The Vrica-Crotone section contains the proposed Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) of the Calabrian Stage and extends from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 65 to 37 for its Calabrian portion. The Montalbano Jonico section extends from MIS 37 to 17 - 16.

40|$|The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is a {{large-scale}} climatic phenomenon modulating ocean-atmosphere variability on decadal time scales. While precipitation and river flow {{variability in the}} Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchments are sensitive to PDO phases, {{the extent to which}} the PDO influences coral reefs is poorly understood. Here, six Porites coral cores were used to produce a <b>composite</b> <b>record</b> of coral luminescence variability (runoff proxy) and identify drivers of terrestrial influence on the Keppel reefs, southern GBR. We found that coral skeletal luminescence effectively captured seasonal, inter-annual and decadal variability of river discharge and rainfall from the Fitzroy River catchment.

Negative luminescence anomalies (reduced runoff) were associated with El Niño years during positive PDO phases while positive luminescence anomalies (increased runoff) coincided with strong/moderate La Niña years during negative PDO phases.

40|$|International audienceMarine {{laminated}} sediments that accumulate {{over time}} {{on the ocean floor}} are an excellent tool to study past climate variability at high temporal resolution. While the existence of discontinuities produced by natural events such as strong bottom currents, bioturbation or lateral depositions are acknowledged, particularly for long records, the extent of their influence on high-resolution sequences has not been well documented. In the present work we show widespread evidence for stratigraphic discontinuities from multiple gravity and box-cores retrieved off Pisco (Peru). Chronostratigraphies are largely based on cross-correlation of distinct sedimentary structures (determined by x-ray image analysis). The visual cross-correlations were validated using 210 -Pb, 241 -Am, and 14 -C profiles, as well as proxy records. The cross-correlation of distinct stratigraphic layers clearly shows that some sedimentary sequences are continuous across scales of tens of kilometers, indicating regional processes determine laminae formation. However, there are often notable absences of laminated sequences in some cores that are present in other cores. The lack of some laminae is likely due to erosion caused by a slump. Despite the losses of sedimentary structures a continuous <b>composite</b> <b>record</b> of the last several centuries was assembled from spliced sequences of different cores.
