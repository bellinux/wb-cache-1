5|$|The British {{zoologist}} Reginald Innes Pocock {{reviewed the}} nomenclature of felids in 1917 and classified the jungle cat group {{as part of}} the genus Felis. In the 1930s, Pocock reviewed the jungle cat skins and skulls from British India and adjacent countries. Based mainly on differences in fur length and colour he subordinated the specimens from Turkestan to Balochistan to Felis chaus chaus, the Himalayan ones to F. c. affinis, the ones from <b>Cutch</b> to Bengal under F. c. kutas, and the tawnier ones from Burma under F. c. fulvidina. He newly described six larger skins from Sind as F. c. prateri, and skins with shorter coats from Sri Lanka and southern India as F. c. kelaarti.|$|E

25|$|Former viceroys {{and other}} high officials, {{as well as}} those who served in the Department of the Secretary of State for India for at least thirty years were {{eligible}} for appointment. Rulers of Indian Princely States were also eligible for appointment. Some states were of such importance that their rulers were almost always appointed Knights Grand Commanders; such rulers included the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Maharaja of Mysore, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, the Maharaja of Baroda, the Maharajas of Gwalior, the Nawab of Bhopal, the Maharaja of Indore, the Maharana of Udaipur, the Maharaja of Travancore, the Maharana of Jodhpur and the Maharao of <b>Cutch.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sati {{remained}} {{legal in}} some princely {{states for a}} time after it had been banned in lands under British control. Baroda and other princely states of Kathiawar Agency banned the practice in 1840, whereas Kolhapur followed them in 1841, the princely state of Indore some time before 1843. According to a speaker at the East India House in 1842, the princely states of Satara, Kingdom of Nagpur and Mysore had by then banned sati. Jaipur banned the practice in 1846, while Hyderabad, Gwalior and Jammu and Kashmir did the same in 1847. Awadh and Bhopal were actively suppressing sati by 1849. <b>Cutch</b> outlawed it in 1852 with Jodhpur having banned sati about the same time.|$|E
25|$|The Kathiawar {{force was}} {{stationed}} near Dhrol which had 17000 to 21000 warriors. The Nawanagar forces included Hapa, Kana, Balach, Jiya, Kabar, Dal, Mod and Rao clans of Jadeja, Sodha, Ahir, Tumbel, Charan, Dhundhan, Dhaman, Sumra, Sindhi, Rajgor and Barots. The forces of Jam Sataji {{was joined by}} Nawab Dolatkhan Ghori and Jagirdar Ra Khengar of Junagadh State; Loma Khuman of Kherdi-Kundla and the warriors sent by Rao Bharmalji I of <b>Cutch</b> State. Sanganji Vadher of Okha and Vasaji Parmar of Muli State joined with their army. Maheraman Ajani of Bhadresar, Kutch joined Nawanagar with his fourteen sons. The Jamat of naked Atit Sadhus, returning from pilgrimage Dwarka and going to Hinglaj Devi, also joined them. The army also had large number of cannons, 84 elephants, cavalry and camels.|$|E
2500|$|In 1890, the Union Steamship Company {{bought the}} ship from {{the estate of}} the Maharajah of <b>Cutch</b> (India), who had been {{using it as a}} yacht. [...] The ship was brought from India to British Columbia under the command of Capt. William Webster, manager of the company. [...] <b>Cutch</b> arrived in British Columbia in June 1890. <b>Cutch</b> was {{originally}} licensed in Canada to carry 150 passengers.|$|E
2500|$|From 1892 to 1896, <b>Cutch</b> {{was used}} on the route from Vancouver to Nanaimo, British Columbia, {{stopping}} en route at Steveston. [...] <b>Cutch</b> carried passengers for the Canadian Pacific Railway, which had rail terminals at both Vancouver and Nanaimo, but which had not then entered into the steamship business.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cutch</b> was rebuilt in 1898, {{with new}} {{machinery}} and cabins for 60 additional passengers. [...] The overall {{size of the}} vessel was more than doubled, from 324 to 676 gross tons.

[...] <b>Cutch</b> was built {{to the order of}} Jumabhoy Lolljee, of Bombay to be used to carry people on {{religious}} pilgrimages. [...] This required a high rate of speed. On July 1, 1884 the ship was taken on the trial run on July 1 this vessel went for her trial trip at Withernsea, at the Humber estuary. [...] Trial speeds of over 12 knots were obtained over a measured mile. [...] As built, <b>Cutch</b> was 180 feet long, with a beam of 23 feet and 12-foot depth of hold. [...] Overall size of the ship as built was 324 gross tons. [...] The hull was iron.|$|E
2500|$|In return, the Company {{undertook}} the [...] "defense {{of these}} subordinate allies and treated them with traditional respect and marks of honor." [...] Subsidiary alliances created the princely states, of the Hindu maharajas and the Muslim nawabs.

2500|$|<b>Cutch</b> was a {{steamship}} {{built in}} 1884 in Hull, England.

Before leaving us the Abban received at least double the original hire. Besides small presents of cloth, dates, tobacco and rice to his friends, he had six cubits of Sauda Wilayati or English indigo-dyed calico for women's fillets, and two of Sauda Kashshi, a <b>Cutch</b> imitation, a Shukkah or half Tobe for his daughter, and a sheep for himself, together with a large bundle of tobacco.|$|E

60|$|P. 5, l. 1. James Gray, Esq. Wordsworth was {{justified}} in naming Gray a 'friend' of Burns. He was originally Master of the High School, Dumfries, and {{associated with the}} Poet there. Transferred to the High School of Edinburgh, he taught for well-nigh {{a quarter of a}} century with repute. Disappointed of the Rectorship, he retired from Edinburgh to an academy at Belfast. Later, having entered holy orders, he proceeded to India as a chaplain in the East India Company's service. He was stationed at Bhooj, in <b>Cutch,</b> near the mouth of the Indus; and the education of the young Rao of that province having been intrusted to the British Government, Gray was selected as his instructor--being the first Christian honoured with such an appointment in the East. He died at his post in 1830, deeply regretted. He was author of 'Cuna of Cheyd' and the 'Sabbath among the Mountains,' and many other things, original and editorial. He left a MS. poem, entitled 'India,' and a translation of the Gospels into the <b>Cutch</b> dialect of Hindoostanee. He will hold a niche in literature as the fifteenth bard in the 'Queen's Wake' who sings of 'King Edward's Dream.' He married a sister of Mrs. Hogg.|$|E
60|$|As {{usual in}} Eastern Africa, {{we did not}} enter the kraal uninvited, but unloosed and pitched the wigwam under a tree outside. Presently the elders {{appeared}} bringing, with soft speeches, sweet water, new milk, fat sheep and goats, for which they demanded a Tobe of <b>Cutch</b> canvass. We passed with them a quiet luxurious day of coffee and pipes, fresh cream and roasted mutton: after the plain-heats we enjoyed the cool breeze of the hills, the cloudy sky, and the verdure of the glades, made doubly green by comparison with the parched stubbles below.|$|E

"The fawn-coloured fossils {{from his}} coralline {{limestone}} are evidently {{the same as}} those of the tertiary formation along the south-east coast of Arabia, and therefore {{the same as those}} of Cutch; and it is exceedingly interesting to find that among the blue-coloured fossils which are accompanied by specimens of the blue shale, composing the beds from which they have been weathered out, are species of Terebratula Belemnites, identical with those figured in Grant's Geology of Cutch; thus enabling us to extend those beds of the Jurassic formation which exist in <b>Cutch,</b> and along the south-eastern coast of Arabia, across to Africa." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Ayyal Ahmed and Ayyal Yunis {{classes of}} the Habr Awal Somal have {{constituted}} themselves Abbans or brokers to the Ogadayn Caravans, and the rapacity of the patron {{has produced a}} due development of roguery in the client.

6000|$|To give two instances, made now notorious by the {{writings}} of geologists. As lately as 1819 a single earthquake shock in <b>Cutch,</b> {{at the mouth of}} the Indus, sunk a tract of land larger than the Lake of Geneva in some places to a depth of eighteen feet, and converted it into an inland sea. The same shock raised, a few miles off, a corresponding sheet of land some fifty miles in length, and in some parts sixteen miles broad, ten feet above the level of the alluvial plain, and left it to be named by the country-people the [...] "Ullah Bund," [...] or bank of God, to distinguish it from the artificial banks in the neighbourhood.|$|E
6000|$|Notwithstanding facts like these, and {{notwithstanding}} his avowed {{opinion that}} the test of organic remains must be used [...] "under {{very much the same}} restrictions as the test of mineral composition," [...] Sir Charles Lyell, too, considers sundry positive conclusions to be justified by this test: even where the community of fossils is slight and the distance great. Having decided that in various places in Europe, middle Eocene strata are distinguished by Nummulites; he infers, without any other assigned evidence, that wherever Nummulites are found--in Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, in Persia, Scinde, <b>Cutch,</b> Eastern Bengal, and the frontiers of China--the containing formation is Middle Eocene. And from this inference he draws the following important corollary:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|The Amir, or, as he styles himself, the Sultan Ahmad bin Sultan Abibakr, {{sat in a}} {{dark room}} with {{whitewashed}} walls, to which hung--significant decorations--rusty matchlocks and polished fetters. His appearance was that of a little Indian Rajah, an etiolated youth twenty-four or twenty- five years old, plain and thin-bearded, with a yellow complexion, wrinkled brows and protruding eyes. His dress was a flowing robe of crimson cloth, edged with snowy fur, and a narrow white turban tightly twisted round a tall conical cap of red velvet, like the old Turkish headgear of our painters. His throne was a common Indian Kursi, or raised cot, about five feet long, with back and sides supported by a dwarf railing: being an invalid he rested his elbow upon a pillow, under which appeared the hilt of a <b>Cutch</b> sabre. Ranged in double line, perpendicular to the Amir, stood the [...] "court," [...] his cousins and nearest relations, with right arms bared after fashion of Abyssinia.|$|E
6000|$|After another delay, and {{a second}} vain message to the Gerad Adan, about noon {{appeared}} that dignitary's sixth wife, sister to the valiant Beuh. Her arrival disconcerted my companions, who were too proud to be protected by a woman. [...] "Dahabo," [...] however, relieved their anxiety by informing us that the Gerad had sent his eldest son Sherwa, as escort. This princess was a gipsy-looking dame, coarsely dressed, about thirty years old, with a gay leer, a jaunty demeanour, and {{the reputation of being}} [...] "fast;" [...] she showed little shame-facedness when I saluted her, and received with noisy joy the appropriate present of a new and handsome Tobe. About 4 P.M. returned our second messenger, bearing with him a reproving message from the Gerad, for not visiting him without delay; in token of sincerity, he forwarded his baton, a knobstick about two feet long, painted in rings of <b>Cutch</b> colours, red, black, and yellow alternately, and garnished on the summit with a ball of similar material.|$|E
60|$|And now, of course, my {{readers will}} {{expect to hear}} {{something}} of the deposits of rock-salt, for which Cheshire and its red rocks are famous. I have never seen them, and {{can only say that}} the salt does not, it is said by geologists, lie in the sandstone, but {{at the bottom of the}} red marl which caps the sandstone. It was formed most probably by the gradual drying up of lagoons, such as are depositing salt, it is said now, both in the Gulf of Tadjara, on the Abyssinian frontier opposite Aden, and in the Runn of <b>Cutch,</b> near the Delta of the Indus. If this be so, then these New Red sandstones may be the remains of a whole Sahara--a sheet of sandy and all but lifeless deserts, reaching from the west of England into Germany, and rising slowly out of the sea; to sink, as we shall find, beneath the sea again.|$|E
60|$|Whitney {{thought his}} {{companion}} had a private reason for dispensing with a paid hand; {{and an extra}} man was certainly not needed for open-water navigation, for Andrew had shown himself quite capable of sailing the Rowan alone. After searching the Glasgow yacht-agents' registers for a boat of sufficiently light draught, they had bought the Rowan at an Ayrshire port; and Whitney got a surprise when his partner drove her through the furious tide-race that swirls around the Mull of Galloway, in a strong breeze of wind. He had confidence in the little yacht after that. She was thirty-two feet long, low in the water, and broad of beam, but her mast was short and her canvas snug: Whitney knew the disadvantages of a long heavy boom. Her deck was laid with narrow planks, no longer white, for there were stains like blood upon them where the rain had run from the mainsail, which was tanned with <b>cutch.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Large herds tended by spearmen {{and grazing}} about the bush, warned {{us that we}} were {{approaching}} the kraal in which the sons of White Ali were camped; at half-past 10 A.M., after riding eight miles, we reached the place which occupies the lower slope of the Northern Hills that enclose the Harawwah valley. We spread our hides under a tree, and were soon surrounded by Bedouins, who brought milk, sun-dried beef, ghee and honey {{in one of the}} painted wooden bowls exported from <b>Cutch.</b> After breakfast, at which the End of Time distinguished himself by dipping his meat into honey, we went out gun in hand towards the bush. It swarmed with sand-antelope and Gurnuk: the ground-squirrels haunted every ant-hill, hoopoos and spur- fowls paced among the thickets, in the trees we heard the frequent cry of the Gobiyan and the bird facetiously termed from its cry [...] "Dobo-dogon- guswen," [...] and the bright-coloured hawk, the Abodi or Bakiyyah [29], lay on wing high in the cloudless air.|$|E
6000|$|Of this I have to observe, that {{universal}} tradition {{represents the}} Somal to be a people of half-caste origin, African and Arabian; moreover, that they expelled the Gallas from the coast, until the latter {{took refuge in}} the hills of Harar. The Gallas are a people partly Moslem, partly Christian, and partly Pagan; this may account for the tradition above recorded. Most Somal, however, declare [...] "Darud" [...] to be a man of ignoble origin, and do not derive him from the Holy City. Some declare he was driven from Arabia for theft. Of course each tribe exaggerates its own nobility with as reckless a defiance of truth as their neighbours depreciate it. But I have made a rule always to doubt what semi-barbarians write. Writing is the great source of historical confusion, because falsehoods accumulate in books, persons are confounded, and fictions assume, as in the mythologic genealogies of India, Persia, Greece, and Rome, a regular and systematic form. On the other hand, oral tradition is more trustworthy; witness the annals and genealogies preserved in verse by the Bhats of <b>Cutch,</b> the Arab Nassab, and the Bards of Belochistan.|$|E
60|$|Harar is {{essentially}} a commercial town: its citizens live, like those of Zayla, by systematically defrauding the Galla Bedouins, and the Amir has made it a penal offence to buy by weight and scale. He receives, as octroi, from eight to fifteen cubits of <b>Cutch</b> canvass for every donkey- load passing the gates, consequently the beast is so burdened {{that it must be}} supported by the drivers. Cultivators are taxed ten per cent., the general and easy rate of this part of Africa, but they pay in kind, which considerably increases the Government share. The greatest merchant may bring to Harar 50l. worth of goods, and he who has 20l. of capital is considered a wealthy man. The citizens seem to have a more than Asiatic apathy, even in pursuit of gain. When we entered, a caravan was to set out for Zayla on the morrow; after ten days, hardly one half of its number had mustered. The four marches from the city eastward are rarely made under a fortnight, and the average rate of their Kafilahs is not so high even as that of the Somal.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the evening}} {{we had three}} sharp jerking shocks of an {{earthquake}} in quick succession, at 9.8 p.m., appearing to come up from the southward: they were accompanied by a hollow rumbling sound {{like that of a}} waggon passing over a wooden bridge. The shock was felt strongly at Dorjiling, and registered by Mr. Muller at 9.10 p.m.: we had accurately adjusted our watches (chronometers) the previous morning, and the motion may therefore fairly be assumed to have been transmitted northwards through the intervening distance of forty miles, in two minutes. Both Mr. Muller and Mr. Hodgson had noted a much more severe shock at 6.10 p.m. the previous evening, which I, who was walking down the mountain, did not experience; this caused a good deal of damage at Dorjiling, in cracking well-built walls. Earthquakes are frequent all along the Himalaya, and are felt far in Tibet; they are, however, most common towards the eastern and western extremities of India; owing in the former case to the proximity of the volcanic forces in the bay of Bengal. <b>Cutch</b> and Scinde, as is well known, have suffered severely on many occasions, and in several of them the motion has been propagated through Affghanistan and Little Tibet, to the heart of Central Asia.* [See [...] "Wood's Travels to the Oxus."] ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{third is}} one Abdy Abokr, {{also of the}} Habr Gerhajis, a personage whom, from, his smattering of {{learning}} and his prodigious rascality, we call the Mulla [...] "End of Time." [...] [10] He is a man about forty, very old-looking for his age, with small, deep-set cunning eyes, placed close together, a hook nose, a thin beard, a bulging brow, scattered teeth, [11] and a short scant figure, remarkable only for length of back. His gait is stealthy, like a cat's, {{and he has a}} villanous grin. This worthy never prays, and can neither read nor write; but he knows a chapter or two of the Koran, recites audibly a long Ratib or task, morning and evening [12], whence, together with his store of hashed Hadis (tradition), he derives the title of Widad or hedge-priest. His tongue, primed with the satirical sayings of Abn Zayd el Helali, and Humayd ibn Mansur [13], is the terror of men upon whom repartee imposes. His father was a wealthy shipowner in his day; but, cursed with Abdy and another son, the old man has lost all his property, his children have deserted him, and he now depends entirely upon the charity of the Zayla chief. The [...] "End of Time" [...] has squandered considerable sums in travelling far and wide from Harar to <b>Cutch,</b> he has managed everywhere to perpetrate some peculiar villany.

60|$|Miriam {{the wife}} of Ephraim, two little children, an orphan boy of their people, Epraim's uncle Jackrael Israel, a white-haired old man, his wife Hester, a Jew from <b>Cutch,</b> one Hyem Benjamin, and Ephraim, Priest and Butcher, made up {{the list of the}} Jews in Shushan. They lived in one house, on the {{outskirts}} of the great city, amid heaps of saltpetre, rotten bricks, herds of kine, and a fixed pillar of dust caused by the incessant passing of the beasts to the river to drink. In the evening the children of the City came to the waste place to fly their kites, and Ephraim's sons held aloof, watching the sport from the roof, but never descending to take part in them. At the back of the house stood a small brick enclosure, in which Ephraim prepared the daily meat for his people after the custom of the Jews. Once the rude door of the square was suddenly smashed open by a struggle from inside, and showed the meek bill-collector at his work, nostrils dilated, lips drawn back over his teeth, and his hands upon a half-maddened sheep. He was attired in strange raiment, having no relation whatever to duster coats or list slippers, and a knife was in his mouth. As he struggled with the animal between the walls, the breath came from him in thick sobs, and the nature of the man seemed changed. When the ordained slaughter was ended, he saw that the door was open and shut it hastily, his hand leaving a red mark on the timber, while his children from the neighbouring house- top looked down awe-stricken and open-eyed. A glimpse of Ephraim busied in one of his religious capacities was no thing to be desired twice.|$|E
