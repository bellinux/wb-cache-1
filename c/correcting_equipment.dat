30|$|With CO 2 embolism, the {{frequency}} of severe adverse events is rare due to the properties of CO 2 gas which is soluble in the blood and gets readily eliminated from the respiratory system. However use of inappropriate equipment such as a laparoscopic insufflator to instill CO 2 during hysteroscopic surgery, has been acknowledged to cause these complications and the surgeons should ensure that the <b>correct</b> <b>equipment</b> is used [45].|$|R

50|$|When the <b>correct</b> <b>equipment</b> is used such as {{a tripod}} and shutter release cable, the {{photographer}} can use long exposures to photograph images of light. For example, when photographing a subject try switching the exposure to manual and selecting the bulb setting on the camera.

50|$|A wet season's paddy harvest may clog {{the screens}} and grain will be lost. Cleaning is {{essential}} before milling. On the farm, cleaning {{is usually a}} combination of winnowing and removal by hand of heavier items such as stones. Losses can be low when the operation is done carefully but high with carelessness. With <b>correct</b> <b>equipment,</b> cleaning losses should be low in mills, but grain may be separated together with dirt or, alternatively, dirt may be carried forward into the milling stages. In drying, grain that is dried in yards or on roads, as is common in parts of Asia, may be partially consumed by birds and rodents. Wind, either natural or from passing vehicles {{in the case of}} road drying, can blow grain away.|$|R
50|$|Condition-based {{maintenance}} {{was introduced}} to try to maintain the <b>correct</b> <b>equipment</b> at the right time. CBM is based on using real-time data to prioritize and optimize maintenance resources. Observing {{the state of the}} system is known as condition monitoring. Such a system will determine the equipment's health, and act only when maintenance is actually necessary. Developments in recent years have allowed extensive instrumentation of equipment, and together with better tools for analyzing condition data, the maintenance personnel of today are more than ever able to decide what is the right time to perform maintenance on some piece of equipment. Ideally condition-based maintenance will allow the maintenance personnel to do only the right things, minimizing spare parts cost, system downtime and time spent on maintenance.|$|R

40|$|The new {{low-temperature}} sterilization {{technologies are}} presented {{as an alternative to}} the use of ethylene oxide. This review was performed in order to identify evidences of the antimicrobial activity, toxicity, adverse events and the applicability of these technologies. The research was carried through the electronic databases MEDLINE and LILACS up to 2005. The authors analyzed 10 articles in this survey. The studies about the efficacy of these sterilization methods constitute experimental and comparative research that showed the influence of the extension and diameter of the lumen, besides the presence of crystal salts. Thus, choosing the <b>correct</b> <b>equipment</b> is essential, as well as the assurance of the cleansing of the devices, which interfere with the effectiveness of the low-temperature sterilization. These technologies present limitations regarding the sterilization of graft bone and affect the materials properties...|$|R
25|$|Successful snail culture {{requires}} the <b>correct</b> <b>equipment</b> and supplies, including: snail pens or enclosures; devices for measuring humidity (hygrometer), temperature (thermometer), soil moisture (soil moisture sensor), and light (in foot candles); a weight scale and {{an instrument to}} measure snail size; a kit for testing soil contents; and a magnifying glass to see the eggs. Equipment to control the climate (temperature and humidity), to regulate water (e.g., a sprinkler system to keep the snails moist and a drainage system), to provide light and shade, and to kill or keep out pests and predators may also be needed. Some horticultural systems such as artificial lighting systems and water sprinklers may be adapted for snail culture. Better results are obtained if snails {{of the same kind}} and generation are used. Some recommend putting the hatchlings in another pen.|$|R
40|$|Background: Mechanical {{ventilation}} is {{a therapeutic}} action for newborns with respiratory diseases but may have side effects. <b>Correct</b> <b>equipment</b> knowledge and training may limit human errors. We aimed to test different neonatal mechanical ventilators' performances by an acquisition module (a commercial pressure sensor plus an isolated chamber and a dedicated software). Methods: The differences (ΔP) between peak pressure values and end-expiration pressure were investigated for each ventilator. We focused on discrepancies among measured and imposed pressure data. A statistical analysis was performed. Results: We investigated the measured/imposed ΔP relation. The ΔP do not reveal univocal trends related to ventilation setting parameters {{and the data}} distributions were non-Gaussian. Conclusions: Measured ΔP represent a significant parameter in newborns' ventilation, due to the typical small volumes. The investigated ventilators showed different tendencies. Therefore, a deep specific knowledge of the intensive care devices is mandatory for caregivers to correctly exploit their operating principles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Selecting the <b>correct</b> <b>equipment</b> is a {{multifaceted}} cost and benefit evaluation process {{due to the}} complexity of today’s construction projects and lack of considerations of all factors. Based on the analysis of traditional influence factors on the selection of construction equipments, carbon emission constraints were introduced to facilitate green construction. These factors were divided into three categories, which are certain factors, soft factors and carbon emission constraints, based on their own characteristics. By the classification of the factors, their impact on the selection of the construction equipments was studied in detail, especially the carbon emission constraints was investigated from three aspects: relationship between the emissions of CO 2 and fuel consumption, standard and regulations of CO 2 and carbon tax. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to find the main influence factors and provide a basic theoretical reference to the selection of construction equipments for decision-makers...|$|R
40|$|A stream {{validation}} {{system called}} SVALI is developed {{in order to}} continuously validate correct behavior of industrial equipment. A functional data model allows the user to define meta-data, analyses, and queries about the monitored equipment in terms of types and functions. Two different approaches to validate that sensor readings in a data stream indicate <b>correct</b> <b>equipment</b> behavior are supported: with the model-and-validate approach anomalies are detected based on a physical model, while with learn-and-validate anomalies are detected by comparing streaming data with a model of normal behavior learnt during a training period. Both models are expressed on a high level using the functional data model and query language. The experiments show that parallel stream processing enables SVALI to scale very well with respect to system throughput and response time. The paper {{is based on a}} real world application for wheel loader slippage detection at Volvo Construction Equipment implemented in SVALI...|$|R
5000|$|The red {{border in}} the {{illustration}} represents the overscan, {{the area of the}} active picture outside the action-safe area. It is not shown on most consumer television screens, unless the user modifies the television's settings. It is generally considered safe to have elements that shouldn't be seen by the viewers placed in this area, such as the edge of the set or cables and other equipment. However, some television production personnel don't place anything in this area they don't want viewers to see because the red area is always transmitted and could potentially be seen by a viewer with the <b>correct</b> <b>equipment.</b> Television stations generally have professional-grade monitors that can be put into [...] "underscan" [...] mode.
