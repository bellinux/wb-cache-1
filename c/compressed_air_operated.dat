40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Growing {{demand for}} {{electricity}} forces suppliers {{to expand their}} generation capacity. Financing these expansion programmes results in electricity cost increases above inflation rates. By reducing electricity consumption, additional supply capacity is created at lower costs than the building of conventional power stations. Therefore, there is strong justification to reduce electricity consumption on the supplier and consumer side. The mining and industrial sectors of South Africa consumed approximately 43 % of the total electricity supplied by Eskom during 2012. Approximately 10 % of this electricity was used to produce <b>compressed</b> <b>air.</b> By reducing the electricity consumption of <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> systems, <b>operating</b> costs are reduced. In turn this reduces the strain on the South African electricity network. Previous energy saving projects on mine <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> systems realised savings that were not always sustainable. Savings deteriorated due to, amongst others, rapid employee turnover, improper training, lack of maintenance and system changes. There is therefore a need to improve projects {{that have already been}} implemented on mine <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> systems. The continuous improvement of equipment (such as improved control valves) and the availability of newer technologies can be used to improve existing energy saving strategies. This study provides a solution to reduce the electricity consumption and operating costs of a deep level mine <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> system. This was achieved by modernising and improving an existing underground <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> saving strategy. This improvement resulted in a power saving of 1. 15 MW; a saving equivalent to an annual cost saving of R 4. 16 million.

Results on particulate emissions indicated that nucleation mode particulates increased with increasing boost. In contrast, agglomeration mode particulates decreased with increasing boost pressure.
