5|$|Changing the reflux (in {{combination}} {{with changes in}} feed and product withdrawal) {{can also be used}} to improve the separation properties of a <b>continuous</b> <b>distillation</b> column while in operation (in contrast to adding plates or trays, or changing the packing, which would, at a minimum, require quite significant downtime).|$|E
25|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>{{distillation}}</b> is {{an ongoing}} distillation in which a liquid mixture is continuously (without interruption) fed into the process and separated fractions are removed continuously as output streams occur over time during the operation. <b>Continuous</b> <b>distillation</b> produces {{a minimum of two}} output fractions, including at least one volatile distillate fraction, which has boiled and been separately captured as a vapor, and then condensed to a liquid. There is always a bottoms (or residue) fraction, which is the least volatile residue that has not been separately captured as a condensed vapor.|$|E

25|$|Both batch and <b>continuous</b> <b>distillations</b> can be {{improved}} by making use of a fractionating column {{on top of the}} distillation flask. The column improves separation by providing a larger surface area for the vapor and condensate to come into contact. This helps it remain at equilibrium for as long as possible. The column can even consist of small subsystems ('trays' or 'dishes') which all contain an enriched, boiling liquid mixture, all with their own vapor–liquid equilibrium.|$|R

25|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>{{distillation}}</b> {{differs from}} batch distillation in the respect that concentrations should not change over time. <b>Continuous</b> <b>distillation</b> can be run {{at a steady}} state for an arbitrary amount of time. For any source material of specific composition, the main variables that affect the purity of products in <b>continuous</b> <b>distillation</b> are the reflux ratio {{and the number of}} theoretical equilibrium stages, in practice determined by the number of trays or the height of packing. Reflux is a flow from the condenser back to the column, which generates a recycle that allows a better separation with a given number of trays. Equilibrium stages are ideal steps where compositions achieve vapor–liquid equilibrium, repeating the separation process and allowing better separation given a reflux ratio. A column with a high reflux ratio may have fewer stages, but it refluxes a large amount of liquid, giving a wide column with a large holdup. Conversely, a column with a low reflux ratio must have a large number of stages, thus requiring a taller column.|$|E
25|$|In <b>continuous</b> <b>distillation,</b> {{the source}} materials, vapors, and {{distillate}} are kept {{at a constant}} composition by carefully replenishing the source material and removing fractions from both vapor and liquid in the system. This results in a better control of the separation process.|$|E
25|$|In {{dimethyl}} terephthalate(DMT) process, this {{compound and}} excess ethylene glycol are reacted in the melt at 150–200°C {{with a basic}} catalyst. Methanol (CH3OH) is removed by distillation to drive the reaction forward. Excess ethylene glycol is distilled off at higher temperature {{with the aid of}} vacuum. The second transesterification step proceeds at 270–280°C, with <b>continuous</b> <b>distillation</b> of ethylene glycol as well.|$|E

In the present work, {{the reaction is}} performed {{in the presence of}} cation-exchange resins as a catalyst. Kinetic parameters like activation energy and the rate constants are estimated using the pseudohomogeneous model. The applicability of reactive distillation for this reaction is evaluated through experiments using batch and <b>continuous</b> reactive <b>distillation</b> techniques. An equilibrium stage model is formulated, and simulation results are compared with the experimental results. Further, the effects of operating parameters like feed mole ratio, catalyst loading, and boilup rate are evaluated on the conversion of lactic acid in batch reactive distillation. Experimental results of <b>continuous</b> reactive <b>distillation</b> are compared with the simulation results observed using the Aspen plus process simulator.

25|$|Brandy {{is usually}} {{produced}} in pot stills (batch distillation), but the column still {{can also be}} used for <b>continuous</b> <b>distillation.</b> Distillate obtained in this manner has a higher alcohol concentration (approximately 90% ABV) and is less aromatic. Choice of the apparatus depends on the style of brandy produced. Cognac and South African brandy are examples of brandy produced in batches while many American brandies use fractional distillation in column stills.|$|E
25|$|The thermal {{cracking}} reaction is highly endothermic, and is generally {{carried out in}} a fired heater. Even though residence time and temperature are carefully controlled, it produces significant quantities of chlorinated hydrocarbon side products. In practice, EDC conversion is relatively low (50 to 60 percent). The furnace effluent is immediately quenched with cold EDC to stop undesirable side reactions. The resulting vapor-liquid mixture then goes to a purification system. Some processes use an absorber-stripper system to separate HCl from the chlorinated hydrocarbons, while other processes use a refrigerated <b>continuous</b> <b>distillation</b> system.|$|E
500|$|Each {{fraction}} {{may contain}} {{one or more}} components (types of chemical compounds). [...] When distilling crude oil or a similar feedstock, each fraction contains many components of similar volatility and other properties. [...] Although {{it is possible to}} run a small-scale or laboratory <b>continuous</b> <b>distillation,</b> most often <b>continuous</b> <b>distillation</b> is used in a large-scale industrial process.|$|E
40|$|The {{applicability}} of reactive distillation for esterification of glycerol with acetic acid {{in the presence}} of Amberlyst- 15 as catalyst and ethylene dichloride as an entrainer is evaluated through experiments and simulation. The reaction is studied in both semibatch and <b>continuous</b> reactive <b>distillation</b> systems. The effect of different parameters such as entrainer amount, catalyst loading, and reboiler duty is studied. The results indicate that entrainer-based semibatch reactive distillation can enhance the selectivity toward triacetin to about 100 %, which is much greater than that offered by any conventional reactor with stoichiometric mole ratio of reactants. Simulations for both sernibatch and <b>continuous</b> reactive <b>distillation</b> are performed, and results agree reasonably well with those obtained by experiments. The best possible design and operating parameters are obtained through detailed simulation using an experimentally validated model. A column configuration is recommended for a continuous process...|$|R

500|$|Since a <b>continuous</b> <b>distillation</b> unit is fed {{constantly}} with a {{feed mixture}} and not filled {{all at once}} like a batch distillation, a <b>continuous</b> <b>distillation</b> unit does not need a sizable distillation pot, vessel, or reservoir for a batch fill. [...] Instead, the mixture can be fed directly into the column, where the actual separation occurs. [...] The height of the feed point along the column can vary on the situation and is designed so as to provide optimal results. [...] See McCabe–Thiele method.|$|E
500|$|When a <b>continuous</b> <b>distillation</b> {{column is}} in operation, {{it has to}} be closely {{monitored}} for changes in feed composition, operating temperature and product composition. [...] Many of these tasks are performed using advanced computer control equipment.|$|E
500|$|In a <b>continuous</b> <b>distillation,</b> {{the system}} is kept in a steady state or {{approximate}} steady state. [...] Steady state means that quantities related to the process do not change as time passes during operation. [...] Such constant quantities include feed input rate, output stream rates, heating and cooling rates, reflux ratio, and temperatures, pressures, and compositions at every point (location). [...] Unless the process is disturbed due to changes in feed, heating, ambient temperature, or condensing, steady state is normally maintained. [...] This is also the main attraction of <b>continuous</b> <b>distillation,</b> apart from the minimum amount of (easily instrumentable) surveillance; if the feed rate and feed composition are kept constant, product rate and quality are also constant. [...] Even when a variation in conditions occurs, modern process control methods are commonly able to gradually return the continuous process to another steady state again.|$|E
25|$|Large scale {{industrial}} distillation applications {{include both}} batch and continuous fractional, vacuum, azeotropic, extractive, and steam distillation.

40|$|Kinetic {{analysis}} for the acid-catalyzed dimerization of C- 4 olefins was performed in a batch reactor, and a suitable rate model was developed. It was further used in the rate-based simulation model of a <b>continuous</b> reactive <b>distillation</b> (RD) column. The results obtained were compared with the experimental observations made on a pilot-scale high-pressure RD column. An important outcome of the present work is that RD can be used efficiently to enhance the selectivity of C- 8 dimers, thereby avoiding the formation of trimers and tetramers. The use of polar components (such as water or alcohols), as selectivity enhancers, is not necessary...|$|R
500|$|The {{principle}} for <b>continuous</b> <b>distillation</b> {{is the same}} as for normal distillation: [...] when a liquid mixture is heated so that it boils, the composition of the vapor above the liquid differs from the liquid composition. If this vapor is then separated and condensed into a liquid, it becomes richer in the lower boiling point component(s) of the original mixture.|$|E
500|$|This is {{what happens}} in a <b>continuous</b> <b>{{distillation}}</b> column. A mixture is heated up, and routed into the distillation column. [...] On entering the column, the feed starts flowing down but part of it, the component(s) with lower boiling point(s), vaporizes and rises. However, as it rises, it cools and while part of it continues up as vapor, some of it (enriched in the less volatile component) begins to descend again.|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} to <b>continuous</b> <b>distillation</b> is batch distillation, where {{the mixture is}} added to the unit {{at the start of the}} distillation, distillate fractions are taken out sequentially in time (one after another) during the distillation, and the remaining bottoms fraction is removed at the end. [...] Because each of the distillate fractions are taken out at different times, only one distillate exit point (location) is needed for a batch distillation and the distillate can just be switched to a different receiver, a fraction-collecting container. [...] Batch distillation is often used when smaller quantities are distilled. [...] In a <b>continuous</b> <b>distillation,</b> each of the fraction streams is taken simultaneously throughout operation; therefore, a separate exit point is needed for each fraction. [...] In practice when there are multiple distillate fractions, the distillate exit points are located at different heights on a fractionating column. The bottoms fraction can be taken from the bottom of the distillation column or unit, but is often taken from a reboiler connected to the bottom of the column.|$|E

500|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>distillation,</b> {{a form of}} distillation, is {{an ongoing}} {{separation}} in which a mixture is continuously (without interruption) fed into the process and separated fractions are removed continuously as output streams. [...] Distillation is the separation or partial separation of a liquid feed mixture into components or fractions by selective boiling (or evaporation) and condensation. The process produces at least two output fractions. [...] These fractions include at least one volatile distillate fraction, which has boiled and been separately captured as a vapor condensed to a liquid, and practically always a bottoms (or residuum) fraction, which is the least volatile residue {{that has not been}} separately captured as a condensed vapor.|$|E
500|$|Distillation {{is one of}} {{the unit}} {{operations}} of chemical engineering. <b>Continuous</b> <b>distillation</b> is used widely in the chemical process industries where large quantities of liquids have to be distilled. Such industries are the natural gas processing, petrochemical production, coal tar processing, liquor production, liquified air separation, hydrocarbon solvents production and similar industries, but it finds its widest application in petroleum refineries. In such refineries, the crude oil feedstock is a very complex multicomponent mixture that must be separated and yields of pure chemical compounds are not expected, only groups of compounds within a relatively small range of boiling points, which are called fractions. [...] These fractions are the origin of the term fractional distillation or fractionation. [...] It is often not worthwhile separating the components in these fractions any further based on product requirements and economics.|$|E
