25|$|A {{synthetic}} ETF has counterparty risk, {{because the}} counterparty is contractually obligated {{to match the}} return on the index. The deal is arranged with collateral posted by the swap <b>counterparty.</b> <b>A</b> potential hazard is that the investment bank offering the ETF might post its own collateral, and that collateral could be of dubious quality.

50|$|A {{dividend}} swap is an over-the-counter financial {{derivative contract}} (in particular {{a form of}} swap). It consists {{of a series of}} payments made between two parties at defined intervals over a fixed term (e.g., annually over 5 years). One party - the holder of the fixed leg - will pay its <b>counterparty</b> <b>a</b> pre-designated fixed payment at each interval. The other party - the holder of the floating leg - will pay its counterparty the total dividends that were paid out by a selected underlying, which can be a single company, a basket of companies, or all the members of an index. The payments are multiplied by a notional number of shares.|$|E
50|$|Equity swaps {{have many}} applications. For example, a {{portfolio}} manager with XYZ Fund can swap the fund's returns for the returns of the S&P 500 (capital gains, dividends and income distributions.) They most often occur when a {{manager of a}} fixed income portfolio wants the portfolio to have exposure to the equity markets either as a hedge or a position. The portfolio manager would enter into a swap {{in which he would}} receive the return of the S&P 500 and pay the <b>counterparty</b> <b>a</b> fixed rate generated from his portfolio. The payment the manager receives will be equal to the amount he is receiving in fixed-income payments, so the manager's net exposure is solely to the S&P 500. These types of swaps are usually inexpensive and require little in terms of administration.|$|E
5000|$|Series 35 {{is made up}} of 3 {{notes of}} vastly {{different}} nature: (i) a First-to-Default Note (the [...] "FTD Note") issued by the PIFL that provides the façade to obscure or conceal the CDO underneath; (ii) a floating rate note (i.e. the CDO) issued by Beryl Finance Limited (the [...] "Beryl"), a SPE created and controlled by Lehman Brothers; (c) a note issued by the Lehman US Dollar Liquidity Fund Institutional Reserve Accumulation Class (the [...] "Real Collateral"). Functionally speaking, the FTD Note is merely a deceptive façade because it is not supposed to generate any revenue to the composite note. The FTD Note is credit-linked to six renowned international corporations and the sovereign credit of the People’s Republic of China. Accepting the credit risk of this portfolio only yields USD1 (one US dollar) to the issuer (i.e. the PIFL) for the entire term of the note (i.e. 3 years). The CDO is also a credit-linked note. Like the FTD Notes, the CDO is a bet on the credit-worthiness of a portfolio of securities typically in excess of one hundred selected from a wide array of corporations, industries, and countries. The issuer of CDO (i.e. Beryl) is liable to compensate its swap <b>counterparty</b> (<b>a</b> Lehman Brothers subsidiary) if the credit quality of the portfolio deteriorates. The amount of compensation payable is dependent {{on the extent to which}} the credit-worthiness of the portfolio deteriorates; hence, the swap may be terminated before expiry date if the deterioration has reached the pre-determined level.|$|E

When some <b>counterparties</b> of <b>an</b> agent default, the loss she experiences amounts to her total exposure to those <b>counterparties.</b> <b>A</b> possible conjecture in this context is that individual risk diversification across more numerous counterparties should make also systemic defaults less likely. We show that this view is not always true. In particular, the diversification of credit risk across many borrowers has ambiguous effects on systemic risk in the presence of mechanisms of loss amplifications such as in the presence of potential runs among the short-term lenders of the agents in the network...|$|R

40|$|Bank {{guarantee}} Even after recodification of {{the private}} law in the Czech Republic, the bank guarantee remains an important means of covering risk; mostly due to its universal nature. The aim of this thesis {{is to provide a}} comprehensive view on the topic of bank guarantees, {{especially in light of the}} new Civil Code. The work will focus on defining the nature of the bank guarantee, as well as the ties between the subjects of the relationship formed within bank guarantees, and its basic principles. I have chosen this subject matter, as the bank guarantee remains pertinent, not only in foreign trade, but also in the Czech Republic, as evidenced by legislation such as the Public Procurement Act, the Act on Public Auction, or in the Customs Law. However, the most important role of bank guarantees remains in international trade, where in addition to market risk and performance risk of the contractual <b>counterparty,</b> <b>a</b> territorial risk prevails. In international trade, usually multiple banks take part in the guarantee relationship. This thesis is divided into eight chapters. The first chapter deals with ways of debt security in the new Czech Civil Code and conceptual and terminological changes. It briefly outlines and defines the institutes of insuring debt in new Civil Code. The second chapter concentrates [...] ...|$|E

50|$|Another {{dimension}} of CFD risk is <b>counterparty</b> risk, <b>a</b> factor in most over-the-counter (OTC) traded derivatives. Counterparty risk {{is associated with}} the financial stability or solvency of the <b>counterparty</b> to <b>a</b> contract. In the context of CFD contracts, if the <b>counterparty</b> to <b>a</b> contract fails to meet their financial obligations, the CFD may have little or no value regardless of the underlying instrument. This means that a CFD trader could potentially incur severe losses, even if the underlying instrument moves in the desired direction. OTC CFD providers are required to segregate client funds protecting client balances in event of company default, but cases such as that of MF Global remind us that guarantees can be broken. Exchange-traded contracts traded through a clearing house are generally believed to have less counterparty risk. Ultimately, the degree of counterparty risk is defined by the credit risk of the counterparty, including the clearing house if applicable.|$|R
30|$|A {{paper by}} Duffie and Zhu (2011) focusses on the <b>counterparty</b> risk <b>a</b> CCP is {{supposed}} to mitigate. The authors argue that, under given circumstances, {{the use of multiple}} CCPs may have the counterintuitive effect of increasing <b>counterparty</b> exposure as <b>a</b> consequence of the fragmentation of netting. Also, they conclude that if a GCM deals with derivatives in multiple asset classes, clearing them through a single CCP is more efficient than doing so through multiple CCPs.|$|R
50|$|OTC {{derivatives}} {{can lead}} to significant risks. Especially counterparty risk has gained particular emphasis due to the credit crisis in 2007. Counterparty risk is the risk that <b>a</b> <b>counterparty</b> in <b>a</b> derivatives transaction will default prior to expiration of the trade and will not make the current and future payments required by the contract. There {{are many ways to}} limit counterparty risk. One of them focuses on controlling credit exposure with diversification, netting, collateralisation and hedging.|$|R

50|$|Bilateral netting is {{a legally}} {{enforceable}} arrangement between {{a bank and}} <b>a</b> <b>counterparty</b> that creates <b>a</b> single legal obligation covering all included individual contracts. This means that a bank’s obligation, {{in the event of}} the default or insolvency of one of the parties, would be the net sum of all positive and negative fair values of contracts included in the bilateral netting arrangement.|$|R
50|$|A swap bank is {{a generic}} term to {{describe}} a financial institution that facilitates swaps between <b>counterparties.</b> <b>A</b> swap bank can be an international commercial bank, an investment bank, a merchant bank, or an independent operator. The swap bank serves as either a swap broker or swap dealer. As a broker, the swap bank matches counterparties but does not assume any risk of the swap. The swap broker receives a commission for this service. Today, most swap banks serve as dealers or market makers. As a market marker, the swap bank stands willing to accept {{either side of a}} currency swap, and then later lay it off, or match it with <b>a</b> <b>counterparty.</b> In this capacity, the swap bank assumes a position in the swap and therefore assumes certain risks. The dealer capacity is obviously more risky, and the swap bank would receive a portion of the cash flows passed through it to compensate it for bearing this risk.|$|R
