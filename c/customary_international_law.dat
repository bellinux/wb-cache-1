5|$|Lim Chin Leng has {{opined that}} Taw Cheng Kong stands as {{authority}} for {{the proposition that the}} Singapore courts will apply in domestic law the rules and principles of public international law that have previously been received into the common law. The Court of Appeal recognized a rule of <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> that had been received into the common law, that is, the presumption against extraterritoriality, and ascribed to Parliament the intent to uphold that rule for the purposes of construing a statutory provision.|$|E
5|$|The {{meaning of}} the word law in Article 9(1) has a direct bearing on the scope of the Article. If law is read broadly (for example, as {{incorporating}} <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> principles), the scope of the fundamental liberties would be wider. It would be narrower if, on the other hand, law is construed narrowly, as the Legislature would be able to curtail such rights through legislation more easily. This could lead to a watering-down of the emphasis on fundamental liberties, as any infringement might be considered legitimate so long as the statute in question was validly enacted.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeal was of {{the opinion}} that <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> cannot be {{incorporated}} into {{the meaning of the word}} law in Article 9(1) of the Constitution. <b>Customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> rules do not have any status in domestic law until they are first accepted and adopted as part of domestic law. This can occur when a rule is incorporated into a statute (in which case it is no longer a <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> rule but is regarded as domestic law), or when it is judicially declared to be part of the common law of Singapore. However, <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> can only be incorporated into the common law when it is not inconsistent with existing domestic laws. Given the existence of the mandatory death penalty in several Singapore statutes, the Court {{was of the}} opinion that it could not treat the alleged <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> rule prohibiting inhuman punishment as part of Singapore common law. Also, even if a rule has been incorporated in this manner, it may be overridden by subsequent inconsistent statutory provisions. Moreover, the Court did not accept the contention that <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> should be conferred constitutional status by being read into the meaning of law in Article 9(1) as this is clearly not in accordance with the normal hierarchy of Singapore law.|$|E

25|$|The Attorney-General {{submitted}} {{that there}} are two possible ways in which to interpret the word law. First, it could be taken to refer only to statutes and the common law applicable in Singapore. Secondly, it could be interpreted to include rules of <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law.</b> When queried by the Court of Appeal as to his preferred interpretation, he responded that, in principle, the word law should be taken to include <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law,</b> but only rules which had already been recognized and applied by the domestic courts of Singapore.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, the International Court of Justice {{ruled that}} {{portions}} of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 merely declare existing <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law.</b> In 1993, the UN Security Council adopted a binding Chapter VII resolution establishing an International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.

25|$|Furthermore, the Attorney-General {{disagreed}} with the contention that the mandatory death penalty violates any <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> prohibition against inhuman punishment. He submitted that the decisions after Ong Ah Chuan and Nguyen Tuong Van were reflective of the Privy Council's changing attitude toward the mandatory death penalty specifically, but did not reflect any international consensus that the mandatory death penalty is prohibited {{by the rules of}} <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law.</b> This was evident from {{the fact that there are}} still 31 states worldwide which continue to impose the mandatory death penalty for drug-related offences as well as other serious crimes. Thus, the international consensus needed to establish the principle contended for by the appellant was lacking.|$|E

25|$|<b>International</b> Humanitarian <b>Law</b> (IHL), Treaties and <b>Customary</b> <b>Law</b> <b>International</b> Humanitarian <b>Law</b> {{is a set}} {{of rules}} that come into effect in armed conflicts. It aims to {{minimize}} the harms of an armed conflict by imposing obligations and duties to those who participate in armed conflicts. IHL mainly deals with two parts, the protection of persons who are not, or no longer taking part in fighting and restrictions on the means and methods of warfare such as weapons and tactics. IHL is founded upon Geneva conventions which were first signed in 1864 by 16 countries. Traditions and Customs had governed the conduct of war until then, which varied depending on the location and time. The First Geneva Convention of 1949 covers the protection for the wounded and sick of armed conflict on land. The Second Geneva Convention asks for the protection and care for the wounded, sick and shipwrecked of armed conflict at sea. The Third Geneva Convention emphasizes the treatment of prisoners of war. The Fourth Geneva Convention concerns the protection of civilians in time of war. In addition, there are many more body of <b>Customary</b> <b>International</b> <b>Laws</b> (CIL) that come into effect when necessary.|$|R
40|$|With {{small scale}} {{internal}} armed conflicts unfortunately becoming increasingly commonplace, this paper critically discusses {{the lack of}} clarity around the definition of an internal political armed conflict, that {{does not meet the}} threshold tests as defined by <b>International</b> Criminal <b>Law</b> and <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> criminal <b>law.</b> The paper examines the Rome Statute 1998 as well as <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> case <b>law</b> around the subject. Furthermore, the paper analyses the negotiations process surrounding the creation of the Rome Statute, to establish the reasoning and justification for such a narrow interpretation of what constitutes a NIPAC; critiquing the definitions outlined in Articles 7 and 8 of the treaty and the test outlined in paragraphs 561 to 568 of the May 1997 trial judgement decision of the International Criminal Tribunal of Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the Prosecutor v Tadić (IT- 94 - 1). The paper also uses the Tadić decision as a jumping off point for <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> criminal <b>law</b> and examines how subsequent cases and statutes have interpreted this decision; such as the Special Court of Sierra Leone and further ICTY decisions. Finally, the paper examines the interpretation of both bodies of <b>law</b> within the <b>international</b> criminal justice system framework using recent International Criminal Court cases as examples...|$|R
25|$|It is {{commonly}} accepted that, {{at least since}} World War II, genocide has been illegal under <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> as a peremptory norm, as well as under conventional international law. Acts of genocide are generally difficult to establish for prosecution, because a chain of accountability must be established. International criminal courts and tribunals function primarily because the states involved are incapable or unwilling to prosecute crimes of this magnitude themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{prohibition}} {{of crimes against}} humanity forms {{part of the body}} of peremptory norms (jus cogens) that bind the entire international community as a matter of <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law.</b> Individuals who commit crimes against humanity in the DPRK may therefore be held responsible, even though the DPRK has not yet included crimes against humanity in its domestic criminal law and is not a State party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The fact that perpetrators of these crimes have acted on superior orders does not relieve them of criminal responsibility.|$|E

The court found that it was obliged to apply this exception and refused to take on claims by Nicaragua based on the United Nations Charter and Organization of American States charter, but concluded that it could still decide the case based on <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> obligations with 11-4 majority.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, many of today’s armed {{conflicts}} do {{not take}} place between States but are of a non-international character. <b>International</b> humanitarian treaty <b>law,</b> however, while highly detailed as regards international armed conflicts, is considerably less developed in relation to non-international armed conflicts. Here, again, <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> humanitarian <b>law</b> can give further guidance.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} heated debates {{of the last two}} decades in U. S. legal academia focuses on <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law’s</b> {{domestic}} status after Erie Railroad v. Tompkins. At one end, champions of the “modern position” support <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law’s</b> (“CIL”) wholesale incorporation into post-Erie federal common law. At the other end, “revisionists” argue that federal courts cannot apply CIL as federal law absent federal legislative authorization. Scholars {{on both sides of the}} Erie debate also make claims about the sources judges reference when discerning CIL. They then use these claims to support their arguments regarding CIL’s domestic status. Interestingly, neither side of the debate has conducted an empirical analysis of what U. S. federal courts have actually done. This Article undertakes such an analysis and suggests that U. S. federal courts have, for the most part, behaved in a manner unanticipated by revisionists and modernists alike—the courts have followed themselves. After tracking the sources considered as evidence of CIL and cited in both pre-Erie and post-Erie case law, it turns out that, at all times before and after Erie in 1938, U. S. federal judges have relied primarily on domestic case law when making CIL determinations. Put starkly, the great Erie debate about CIL determinations in U. S. federal courts—and the authority the judiciary ought to attach to certain international sources—may have been occurring somewhat orthogonally to the fact that U. S. courts do not seem to pay much attention to these sources in practice...|$|R

25|$|While {{the term}} can include acts {{committed}} in the air, on land (especially across national borders or in connection with taking over and robbing a car or train), or in other major bodies of water or on a shore, {{this article focuses on}} maritime piracy. It does not normally include crimes committed against people traveling on the same vessel as the perpetrator (e.g. one passenger stealing from others on the same vessel). Piracy or pirating is the name of a specific crime under <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> and also the name of a number of crimes under the municipal law of a number of states. In the early 21st century, seaborne piracy against transport vessels remains a significant issue (with estimated worldwide losses of US$16billion per year in 2007), particularly in the waters between the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, off the Somali coast, and also in the Strait of Malacca and Singapore.|$|E
25|$|All {{international}} human rights law is based in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted in 1948. This document outlines the inalienable and fundamental rights of humankind that are protected regardless of gender, race, class, sexual orientation, religion, or any other social, economic, or political factor. The articles in the UDHR are not legally binding, but they are recognized as part of <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law,</b> and they authorize the development of binding international treaties, which countries may choose to sign and ratify. International human rights treaties and monitoring processes, however, privileges national governments and limits the role of local officials, whose cooperation {{in the implementation of}} international law is critical. The day-to-day work of implementing human rights standards often rests on the shoulders of local and regional authorities. They too are bound by these agreements. Local and regional authorities are often directly responsible for services related to health care, education, housing, water supply, environment, policing and also, in many cases, taxation.|$|E
500|$|In Nguyen Tuong Van v.

Also, even if there was a <b>customary</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> rule against death by hanging, domestic statutes would prevail in the event of conflict.|$|E
