Succinylation is a useful method of improving the functional properties of protein significantly. This study assessed the effects of succinylation on the functional properties of yak and cow <b>caseins,</b> including solubility, emulsifying property, water and oil absorption capacity, foaming property, and digestibility. Six succinylated levels of <b>caseins</b> were prepared by adding different amounts of succinic anhydride to <b>caseins.</b> The succinylated degree of yak and cow <b>caseins</b> was different when similar amounts of succinic anhydride were added. Succinylation improved solubility, emulsifying activity, water and oil absorption capacity, and reduced foam stability and digestibility of yak and cow native <b>caseins.</b> However, succinylation decreased foaming capacity and emulsion stability of cow <b>caseins</b> while increased them of yak <b>caseins.</b> The functional properties of <b>caseins</b> changed irregularly with increasing levels of succinylation.

These other proteins are more water-soluble than <b>caseins</b> and do not form larger structures. Because the proteins remain suspended in whey remaining when <b>caseins</b> coagulate into curds, they are collectively known as whey proteins. Whey proteins make up approximately 20% of the protein in milk by weight. Lactoglobulin is the most common whey protein by a large margin.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the neonatal immune system is well balanced by breast milk components leading to an appropriate maturation of the immune system. Poorly balanced support of the developing immune system may lead to autoimmune diseases or allergies. Different properties of milk formula components could be the reason for deviations from this balance. Little {{is known about the}} molecular mechanisms leading to effects of milk components on the immune system. One mechanism known to regulate B-cell receptor-mediated cell activation is the inhibitory effect of CD 22, which sialic acid-dependent interaction on the B-cell surface seems to be critical for its negative regulatory function. The results presented in this work provide a differentiated perspective for the regulation of the immune system by milk glycoproteins/-peptides and clearly demonstrate species-dependent differences between milk proteins. Human <b>caseins</b> were identified as potential inhibitors of the sialic acid-dependent interaction of CD 22 with IgM. They inhibited better than undigested camel <b>caseins,</b> human whey proteins and bovine <b>caseins.</b> Proteolytic digestion of <b>caseins</b> reduced the inhibitory potencies, whereas the inhibitory potencies of digested whey proteins increased. Most of the sialylated proteins and CD 22 -specific binding partners were identified in human <b>caseins</b> by lectin blotting. After affinity chromatography of human <b>caseins,</b> <b>caseins</b> (k-casein) and the MFGM proteins clusterin and lactoferrin were identified as isolated ligands of CD 22. In B-cell activation assays the Ca-mobilisation was clearly reduced in presence of digested <b>caseins</b> and whey proteins, but sialylation appears to reduce these effects strongly. Obviously, the interaction of milk glycoproteins/-peptides lead to different effects than the sialic acid derivative BPC-Neu 5 Ac, which reduces the inhibitory function of CD 22. This finding indicate a mechanism independent of the sialic acid binding site for the milk glycoproteins/-peptides...|$|R

The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult locust, 14–18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef.

25|$|The {{canonical}} Wnt Pathway {{involves the}} accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm, which activates transcription factors. <b>Casein</b> kinase 1 epsilon, and related <b>casein</b> kinase 1 delta, is dephosphorylated in this pathway.

The current theory for how <b>casein</b> kinase 1 epsilon and/or <b>casein</b> kinase 1 delta function in this pathway is that both <b>casein</b> kinases either directly stabilize β-catenin though positive regulation, or that they indirectly stabilizes β-catenin through negative regulation of the β-catenin degradation complex (protease).|$|E

Aqueous solutions of samples in 8 M urea were submitted to a polyacrylamide gel gradient (10 % to 18 %). Gel scans from electrophoresis patterns of previously adulterated milk samples showed that <b>caseins</b> peak areas decreased while peak areas of beta -lactoglobulin plus alpha -lactalbumin increased {{as the percentage of}} raw milk powder replaced by whey powder increased.

40|$|Bovine milk {{possesses}} a protein system constituted by two major families of proteins: <b>caseins</b> (insoluble) and whey proteins (soluble). <b>Caseins</b> (αS 1, αS 2, β, and κ) are the predominant phosphoproteins {{in the milk}} of ruminants, accounting for about 80 % of total protein, while the whey proteins, representing approximately 20 % of milk protein fraction, include β-lactoglobulin, α-lactalbumin, immunoglobulins, bovine serum albumin, bovine lactoferrin, and lactoperoxidase, together with other minor components.

40|$|Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays {{a central}} role in blood {{pressure}} regulation by producing the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. The inhibition of ACE with natural inhibitors, as alternatives to avoid the side effect of synthetic drugs, is a major target in the prevention of hypertension. In this study, we examined the separated <b>caseins</b> and whey proteins of goat milk for the presence of ACE inhibitory peptides. Digestion of isolated whey proteins and <b>caseins</b> of goat milk by gastric pepsin generated soluble hydrolysates exhibiting significant inhibition of ACE compared to weak inhibition by undigested proteins. The hydrolysates were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography, Sephacryl S- 100 column, into four fractions (F 1 –F 4). The late-eluting fraction (F 4) of either whey or <b>caseins</b> exhibited greater ACE inhibition. Peptides in both F 4 fractions, isolated by RP-HPLC, exhibited variable ACE inhibitory activities with the hydrophobic peptide peaks being the most potent ACE inhibitors. MALDI-TOF MS/MS resulted in identification of three potent ACE inhibitory peptides: PEQSLACQCL from β-lactoglobulin (residues 113 – 122), QSLVYPFTGPI from β-casein (residues 56 – 66), and ARHPHPHLSFM from κ-casein (residues 96 – 106).

While most patrons of coffee do so because of its unique and satisfying taste, consumers may be unaware of the potential beneficial health effects it also imparts. The antioxidants found in green coffee beans collectively known as chlorogenic acids (CGA) and caffeine {{are two of the}} most abundant bioactive compounds present in coffee. Both these bioactive compounds have been implicated in many studies to impart a wide range of health benefits, from reducing the risk of Type 2 diabetes, to their use as aides in weight management. Indeed, epidemiological studies on people who consume moderate amounts of coffee on a regular basis have unanimously shown benefits to overall health. While caffeine and CGA are naturally occurring compounds in coffee, their potential in conferring beneficial health effects warrant research into other potential food matrixes {{that can be used to}} bind and deliver these bioactive compounds into foods that do not naturally contain them. Milk proteins, specifically <b>caseins,</b> have been shown to be excellent vehicles to both bind and deliver sensitive bioactive compounds of various chemical and physical properties. <b>Caseins</b> have been shown in numerous studies to successfully bind to molecules such as vitamin D 2, ω- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (DHA), and iron to name a few. Because <b>caseins</b> exhibit high versatility in binding a variety of molecules, <b>caseins</b> were the milk protein of choice for the experiments in this thesis. Polyphenols have been the subject of many studies on its binding capacity with milk proteins, but research on the binding capacity of caffeine with <b>caseins</b> is limited.
