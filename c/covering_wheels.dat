50|$|In simplistic terms, sports-prototypes are two-seat racing {{cars with}} {{bodywork}} <b>covering</b> their <b>wheels,</b> and are as technically advanced and, {{depending on the}} regulations they are built to, as quick as or quicker than their single-seat counterparts. Although not widely known, sports-prototypes (along with Formula 1 cars) are responsible for introducing the most numbers of new technologies and ideas to motorsport, including rear-wings, ground effect 'venturi' tunnels, fan-assisted aerodynamics and dual-shift gearboxes. Some of these technologies eventually filter down to road cars.|$|R
50|$|Like all {{the early}} A4 {{locomotives}} prior to Mallard, Golden Shuttle was released to service {{with a single}} chimney and side valances <b>covering</b> the <b>wheels.</b> The valances were removed to aid in maintenance during a general overhaul on 30 January 1942. Experimental Automatic Train Control equipment was fitted on 23 June 1950. A double chimney and Kylchap double blastpipe was installed to help performance, during an overhaul 20 August 1958. A Smith-Stone type speed indicator was installed 30 June 1960.|$|R

50|$|Designed by ingegnere Rodolfo Verduzio, the Caproni 133 was aerodynamically and {{structurally}} {{an improved}} Ca.101. Like its predecessor, the Ca.101, was a robust and inexpensive aircraft, {{designed to be}} easily maintained in difficult conditions and economical to operate. It had a welded steel-tube structure, mixed construction, with metal and fabric <b>covering,</b> main <b>wheel</b> spats, flaps and modified tail surfaces. The wing was high-mounted, roughly elliptical, and made of wood and steel. The undercarriage was spatted and fixed. The aircraft was powered by three engines, one in the nose, and one under each wing mounted in faired nacelles, with NACA cowlings, supported by steel tubes.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a wheel sinkage detection method {{that may be}} used in robotic lunar exploration tasks. The method extracts the boundary line between a robot wheel and lunar soil by segmenting the wheel-soil images captured from a video camera that monitors wheel-soil interaction. The detected boundary is projected onto the soil-free image of the robot wheel to determine the depth of wheel sinkage. The segmentation method is based on graph theory. It first clusters a wheel-soil image into homogeneous regions called superpixels and constructs a graph on the superpixels. It then partitions the graph into segments by using normalized cuts. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed algorithm is more robust to illumination condition, shadows and dust (<b>covering</b> the <b>wheel).</b> The method’s efficacy has been validated by experiments under various conditions.

50|$|The Phoenix was a {{built for}} race {{version of the}} Striker. The core chassis was similar but the {{fiberglass}} bodywork was developed for race purposes with a curved and lowered front and <b>wheel</b> <b>covering</b> outer edges. Used extensively in the kitcar race series the Phoenix is still a popular choice for less expensive end of clubman motorsport. The design was sold by Sylva to Stuart Taylor Motorsport who have since sold it on again. It has recently found a new home with Raw Engineering who also own {{the rights to the}} Striker.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} from sheets of plywood, skinned over wooden ribs. Using a large concrete mold, a single {{half of the}} fuselage shell was laminated in sections with glue between each layer and then a rubber bladder was lowered into the mold and inflated with air to compress the lamination into shape against {{the inside of the}} mold. The two fuselage halves were then nailed and glued over a separately constructed rib framework. With the fuselage constructed in this fashion, the wing spar couldn't cut through the fuselage, so the single spar cantilever wing was mounted atop the aircraft. Only the engine and landing gear remained essentially unstreamlined, and on the production versions the undercarriage had teardrop shaped [...] "spats" [...] <b>covering</b> the <b>wheels,</b> while only the earliest versions lacked NACA cowlings and had the engine cylinders exposed to the airstream. It was powered by the Wright Whirlwind air-cooled radial engine, which delivered 225 horsepower (168kW).|$|R

500|$|The I-5 was a single-seat biplane with {{staggered}} {{wings in}} a sesquiplane configuration with fixed landing gear and a tailskid. The aircraft was of mixed construction, with the fuselage being {{made of a}} framework of welded steel tubes covered by a fabric skin over the rear fuselage, with the front fuselage section being covered by detachable duralumin panels {{as far back as}} the rear of the cockpit. There were also detachable panels allowing easy access to the tailskid shock absorber. The fabric skin was laced for tightness and the seams were covered with calico. A fireproof bulkhead separated the [...] fuel tank from the engine and a fire extinguisher was fitted with outlets to the fuel pump, inlet pipe and carburetor. The conventional landing gear was connected by a one-piece axle and some aircraft were fitted with teardrop-shaped spats <b>covering</b> the <b>wheels.</b> Initially the tailskid was fixed, but later aircraft had smaller skids that moved in concert with the rudder. Rubber rings were used as shock absorbers on the landing gear.|$|R

5000|$|The only song on {{the album}} {{that has never been}} {{released}} as a single is [...] "Kids Wanna Rock" [...] from Reckless (1984), which replaced [...] "One Night Love Affair", taken from the same album. Although the latter had been released as a single in 1985, charting in Canada and Japan, 'Kids Wanna Rock" [...] proved to be a popular live staple during Adams' world tours. In fact, various live recordings of [...] "Kids Wanna Rock" [...] were issued as B-sides between 1984 and 1992. Other notable singles that were left off include [...] "Hearts on Fire" [...] and [...] "Victim of Love" [...] from 1987, the moderately successful [...] "Thought I'd Died and Gone to Heaven" [...] from 1991, and the 1992 US single [...] "Touch the Hand".

40|$|Efforts towards {{ever more}} energy {{efficient}} passenger cars have {{become one of}} the largest challenges of the automotive industry. This involves numerous different fields of engineering, and every finished model is always a compromise between different requirements. Passenger car aerodynamics is no exception; the shape of the exterior is often dictated by styling, engine bay region by packaging issues etcetera. Wheel design is also a compromise between different requirements such as aerodynamic drag and brake cooling, but as the wheels and wheel housings are responsible for up to a quarter of the overall aerodynamic drag on a modern passenger car, {{it is not surprising that}} efforts are put towards improving the wheel aerodynamics. The actual force on the wheels is typically not a full quarter of the overall drag, but as the wheels strongly interact with several other key flow features such as cooling air flow, underbody flow and the base wake, the wheels have a large influence on the overall aerodynamic performance of the vehicle. This study investigates the potential of different wheel design parameters focusing on reduced aerodynamic drag. A correlation with experimental measurements on a full size vehicle is presented and several additional configurations are analyzed numerically using a standard automotive CFD approach. Furthermore, the potential of optimizing the front and rear wheels individually is investigated to some extend. Results show that closing most of the rear wheels results in local drag reductions along the rear end underbody, rear wheels and vehicle base. The fully covered rear wheel typically reduced base drag between 6 - 7 drag counts. Effects of <b>covering</b> the front <b>wheels</b> were more complex as both upstream and downstream flow regions were affected, and it was shown that for the vehicle investigated in this study a limited amount of outer radial <b>covering</b> of the <b>wheel</b> gave the largest drag reduction. The investigation of using different front and rear wheel designs showed that this concept have potential in reducing overall drag as it generated the largest drag reduction in this study of approximately 22 drag counts...|$|R
2500|$|The wings {{featured}} the large rectangular fairings {{for the large}} [...] main wheels. Small wheel well doors, originally planned for the G series, were fitted to the outer ends of the <b>wheel</b> bays, <b>covering</b> the outer <b>wheels</b> when retracted. These doors were often removed by front-line units. The radio equipment was the FuG 16ZY with the relocated main swept-forward radio antenna under the port wing from the G-10 being carried through as the standard for the K-series airframes. The FuG 25a Erstling IFF system, {{as well as the}} FuG 125 Hermine D/F equipment were also fitted. Internally, the oxygen bottles were relocated from the rear fuselage to the right wing. Flettner tabs for the ailerons were also to be fitted to serial production aircraft to reduce control forces but were extremely rare, with the majority of the K-4s using the same aileron system as the G series.|$|R
50|$|In 1971, the 1,275 cc Mini Cooper S was {{discontinued}} in the UK, {{leaving the}} Mini 1275 GT {{as the only}} sporting Mini on sale {{for the rest of}} the decade. Innocenti in Italy, however, continued making their own version of the Mini Cooper for some time. While the UK built 1275 GT was not nearly as quick as a 1275 Mini Cooper S, it was cheaper to buy, run, and insure. It was the first Mini to be equipped with a tachometer. It also featured a standard-fit close-ratio gearbox, and initially had 10 inch Rostyle <b>wheels</b> <b>covering</b> the 7.5inch Cooper S type disc brakes, and a boot board, both were dropped in 1974. Performance of the 1275GT was lively for the time, achieving 0-60 mph in 12.9 seconds, and the excellent midrange torque offered a 30 - 50 mph time in top gear of only nine seconds. The bluff front, however, meant that the model struggled to reach 90 mi/h km/h.|$|R
5000|$|The {{drophead}} coupé (DHC) had a padded, lined canvas top, which folded {{onto the}} rear deck behind the seats when retracted, and roll-up windows with opening quarter lights. The flat glass two-piece windscreen {{was set in}} a steel frame that was integrated with the body and painted the same colour. Dashboards and door-caps in both the DHC and the closed coupé (FHC) were wood-veneered, whereas the more spartan roadsters were leather-trimmed. All models had removable spats ("fender skirts" [...] in America) <b>covering</b> the rear <b>wheel</b> arches, which enhanced the streamlined look. On cars fitted with optional centre-lock wire wheels (available from 1951), the spats were omitted as they gave insufficient clearance for the chromed, two-eared Rudge-Whitworth knockoff hubs. Chromium-plated wire wheels were optional from 1953. When leaving the factory it originally fitted 6.00 × 16 inch cross ply tyres on 16 × 5K solid wheels (Pre-1951). Later cars could also specify 185VR16 Pirelli Cinturato tyres as a radial option.|$|R
40|$|Metal-bonded wheels {{have a few}} {{advantages}} over normal grinding wheels, including higher stiffness, better thermal conductivity for removing process heat and high tool durability. This means grinding of hard materials like ceramics can be done more accurately; the tool life is longer; reshaping of the tool is delayed; and higher G-ratios can be achieved. To keep the super-abrasive metal-bonded grinding wheels sharp and to ground mirror-like surfaces, in ELID-grinding the wheels are dressed continuously and in-process through electrolytic passivation. An electric current between the anodic wheel and an external electrode {{can lead to the}} formation of an insulating layer <b>covering</b> the <b>wheel.</b> The goal {{of this study is to}} investigate the fundamentals in the growth of the layer in order to have a better understanding in the process. By analyzing the evolution of the voltage and current pulses generated by the power supply (Fuji ELIDER ED 921) the layer growth can be monitored. At the start of pre-dressing, the cast iron bond (CIB) is purely metallic. The impedance of the electrolytic cell has a high capacitance and a small resistance. The current dissolves the iron which is then recombined with oxidizers of the electrolyte to form dense and insulating hydroxides. Measurements of the passivation layer resistance for different parameter settings show a steady rise until the insulation is completed. The results for different parameter settings are consistent with Faraday‟s law which states that the accumulated charge governs the layer growth. From these experiments an equivalent electrical model is derived. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the convertible version of the TR7 required the interior light, {{which was in the}} headlining, to be removed. This was replaced by lights with integral switches in each of the door cards. A map light, mounted between the seats on the back panel below the rear parcel shelf, was deleted. The convertible also required a smaller fuel filler cap, as the deck area in front of the boot lid was reduced to allow for the stowage of the hood. These modifications were also applied to the hard top for the 1978 year model (starting after the factory's summer shutdown in 1977), presumably to maintain commonality of parts on the assembly line. The wheel trims were also changed at this time, from smaller black trims that covered only the centre of the wheels, to larger silver ones, <b>covering</b> the whole <b>wheel.</b> However, {{only a small number of}} 1978 year model cars, with the smaller filler cap and lights in the door cards, were produced at Speke, due to the industrial action there in 1977-78.|$|R
40|$|Passenger cars {{represent}} the largest {{part of all}} means of personal transportation today. Thus, {{it is important to}} work towards reduced energy consumption of cars if a sustainable mobility is to be achieved. This involves many aspects of vehicle engineering; one of them being aerodynamics. This study focuses on aerodynamic drag and the contributions from the wheels at different cooling air flow configurations. Wheels and wheel housings are important for the overall aerodynamic drag on passenger cars. It has been shown that as much as 25 % of the aerodynamic drag originates from these components. Therefore, it is desirable to understand the flow structures related to the wheels and wheel housings, and how they interact with other important flow regions. This paper presents an investigation of the effects of wheel designs on aerodynamic drag at different cooling air flow configurations on a sedan type passenger car. Comparisons between numerical simulations and wind tunnel measurements are made for some of the configurations as well. Several additional wheel configurations were investigated numerically to further investigate the flow structures at the front and rear wheels. The numerical results show that the effects of radial <b>wheel</b> <b>covering</b> varied noticeably with cooling air flow configuration. In two of the configurations this resulted in a net drag increase with closed cooling air inlets. The best configuration with closed cooling air inlets generated an overall drag reduction of 29 drag counts compared with the numerical baseline with open cooling air inlets. In addition to the obvious drag reduction of closing the cooling air inlets, the main reasons for the additional decrease was limiting the drag increase at the front stagnation region and positive interference effects along the underbody and vehicle base...|$|R
