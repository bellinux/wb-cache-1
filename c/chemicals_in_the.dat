5|$|Observations {{during a}} flyby on March 12, 2008, {{revealed}} additional <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plume, including trace amounts of simple hydrocarbons such as methane, propane, acetylene and formaldehyde.

5|$|Acne vulgaris is {{a chronic}} skin {{disease of the}} pilosebaceous unit and {{develops}} due to blockages in the skin's hair follicles. These blockages are thought to occur {{as a result of}} the following four abnormal processes: a higher than normal amount of oily sebum production (influenced by androgens), excessive deposition of the protein keratin leading to comedo formation, colonization of the follicle by Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) bacteria, and the local release of pro-inflammatory <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skin.|$|E
5|$|Bees {{can suffer}} serious effects from toxic {{chemicals}} in their environments. These include various synthetic chemicals, such as insecticides and fertilizers, {{as well as}} a variety of naturally occurring chemicals from plants, such as ethanol resulting from the fermentation of organic materials. Bee intoxication can result from exposure to ethanol from fermented nectar, ripe fruits, and manmade and natural <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> environment.|$|E

5|$|The bay {{receives}} the fourth {{highest level of}} toxic <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state from bayside industrial discharge, in addition to pollutants washing in from the Houston Ship Channel. Although contaminants from the major industrial complexes along the bay contribute substantially to bay pollution, most {{is the result of}} storm run-off from various commercial, agricultural, and residential sources. In recent decades, conservation efforts have been enacted which have improved water quality in the bay.|$|E
5|$|The <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> red-colored zone {{include an}} {{aromatic}} quinone, beta-carotene, and chlorophyll. The quinone is deep-red colored pigment chiodectonic acid, thought {{to function as}} a radiation protectant; in combination with beta-carotene, which has an established role in cellular DNA repair following exposure of the organism to UV-damage, such radiation protectants are often found in lichens and in extremophilic situations and are essential for survival.|$|E

5|$|Balard found bromine <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ash of seaweed {{from the}} salt marshes of Montpellier. The seaweed {{was used to}} produce iodine, but also {{contained}} bromine. Balard distilled the bromine from a solution of seaweed ash saturated with chlorine. The properties of the resulting substance were intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine; thus he tried {{to prove that the}} substance was iodine monochloride (ICl), but after failing to do so he was sure that he had found a new element, and named it muride, derived from the Latin word muria for brine.|$|E
5|$|Cnidocytes {{can only}} fire once, and about 25% of a hydra's nematocysts are lost from its tentacles when {{capturing}} a brine shrimp. Used cnidocytes {{have to be}} replaced, which takes about 48hours. To minimise wasteful firing, two types of stimulus are generally required to trigger cnidocytes: nearby sensory cells detect <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water, and their cilia respond to contact. This combination prevents them from firing at distant or non-living objects. Groups of cnidocytes are usually connected by nerves and, if one fires, {{the rest of the}} group requires a weaker minimum stimulus than the cells that fire first.|$|E
5|$|Internal parasites of {{the common}} loon include many species of worms, {{including}} flatworms, tapeworms, nematodes and spiny-headed worms. High levels of worms may result from feeding changes due to low availability of fish, {{and can lead to}} illness and death. Protozoal infections including one caused by Eimeria gaviae and avian malaria has been recorded in this loon. The black fly Simulium annulus is closely associated with the common loon to which it is attracted to <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> uropygial gland secretions as well as by visual and tactile cues. This fly is detrimental to loons, their preferred hosts, transmitting blood-borne parasites and viruses, and causing nest abandonment when numbers are high. External parasites include ischnoceran feather lice, although these are not found on the bird's head.|$|E

5|$|Purified water {{should be}} used for {{watering}} purposes, although 'hard water' is tolerated. This is done to minimise the build-up of minerals and <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soil. Water purity greater than 100p.p.m. of total dissolved solids is often quoted as ideal. A reverse osmosis unit can be used to filter the water or, alternatively, bottled distilled water can be purchased. Watering should be done regularly. However, plants {{should not be allowed to}} sit in water, as this may lead to root rot.|$|E
5|$|The {{gigantic}} bones {{attributed to}} A. fragillimus {{have often been}} ignored in summaries of the largest dinosaurs partly because, according to various subsequent reports, the whereabouts of both the vertebra and the femur are unknown, and all attempts to locate them have failed. Carpenter, in 2006, presented a possible scenario for {{the disappearance of the}} A. fragillimus specimens. As Cope noted in his description, the neural arch bone material was very fragile, and techniques to harden and preserve fossil bone had not yet been invented (Cope's rival, paleontologist O.C. Marsh, was the first to use such <b>chemicals,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1880s). Carpenter observed that the fossil bones known from the A. fragillimus quarry would have been preserved in deeply weathered mudstone, which tends to crumble easily and fragment into small, irregular cubes. Therefore, the bone may have crumbled badly and been discarded by someone at the American Museum of Natural History (possibly even by Cope himself) soon after he illustrated it in rear view for his paper. Carpenter suggested that this may explain why Cope drew the vertebra in only one view, rather than from multiple angles as he did for his other discoveries.|$|E
5|$|Child labour in the industries, {{especially}} in match making factories, {{was at its}} peak during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1981, the child work force in the age group 4–16 was 30% of the total work force, 90% of whom were girls. In 1986, the National Child Labour project estimated child labour in Sivaksi match making industries to be 14,121 children. The estimates indicated 80% of the child labour belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), who were margianlised for centuries for cheap labour. Poverty and lack of farm produce were stated as {{the main reason for}} child labour. The employers also preferred children because of ease in management, discipline and lack of labour unions. The children in these industries suffered from back ache, neck ache, tuberclosis, malnutrition, gastointestinal disorders, dermatitis, respiratory disorders, over-exhaustion, burn injuries and water borne diseases due to exposure to harmful <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> work environment. The situation of the child labour came to light during an accident of a bus transporting the children in 1976. The central government appointed a one-man committee under Harbans Singh in 1978, who reported abolishing child labour would seriously impact the economy of the region. The National Policy on child labour was formulated by the central government in August 1987, aiming at the rehabilitation of children withdrawn from these factories. In 1988, the union labour ministry initiated a programme for providing informal education, free health care and free lunch for children working in the factories. The Supreme Court of India, in a judgement ruled on December 1996 indicating provisions for preventing child labour like compensation for the child employed, employment to the adult members of the family and contribution to the corpus fund by the state government. From the establishment of child labour Act in 1986 till 2011, 150,000 inspections on child labour have been conducted in the factories, 1,500 cases have been registered and few prosecutions have been made. The results indicated small amount of child labour in cottage and house hold industries.|$|E
