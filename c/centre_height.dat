40|$|GeoSAR is {{a unique}} dual-band, {{interferometric}} SAR (DBInSAR) sensor capable of collecting single-pass, X-band (VV) and P-band (HH) interferometric data simultaneously. In this paper we examine the dependence of the P-band HH interferometric phase <b>centre</b> <b>height</b> upon forest and terrain parameters. We develop a simple model for P-band GeoSAR observations, and use the model {{to show how the}} elevation in P-band HH phase <b>centre</b> <b>height</b> above true ground height is related to the volume-to-ground scattering ratio. GeoSAR is not fully-polarimetric, but records cross-polar (HV) returns at P-band (although not interferometrically). We conjecture that these returns are dominated by direct-volume scattering and related to the direct-volume HH backscatter. We use this relationship to model the dependence of the P-band HH DTM height upon the HV/HH ratio, and the difference in X-band DEM with P-band DTM heights. The relationships are examined using simulated forest InSAR data, and a model is proposed for ground-height and tree-height estimation using DBInSAR that does not require full polarimetry...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Oil spill {{recovery}} {{by means}} of a rotating drum skimmer was investigated experimentally {{for a wide range of}} design and operating conditions. The effect of drum diameter, drum length, rotating speed, oil lm thickness, oil properties, and drum <b>centre</b> <b>height</b> above the oil/water interface surface were analyzed with respect to oil recovery rate of the drum skimmer. Crude, diesel, SAE 10 W and SAE 140 W oils were used during this investigation. It was found that oil recovery rate increases with increasing drum diameter, drum length, drum <b>centre</b> <b>height</b> above the oil/water interface, and oil slick thickness oil viscosity, and increases as oil density and surface tension decreases. The results revealed that the drum skimmer is an effective device for recovering spills of low viscosity oil, such as light crude oil, which is the type of oil involved in most serious spills and pollutions of the sea. Furthermore, an empirical equation is proposed for predicting the oil recovery rate of the device. The equation can be applied to different oils, and gives good agreement with observed data...|$|E

40|$|Estimates {{of forest}} stand mean height using {{airborne}} LiDAR (light detection and ranging) instruments {{have been reported}} previously with accuracies comparable to traditional ground-based measurements. However, the small area covered by a LiDAR sensor in a single aircraft overpass is a significant hindrance for large-scale forest inventories. In comparison, airborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) systems are also able to make estimates of surface height, but the swath coverage is often far greater, typically five or ten {{times that of the}} LiDAR coverage. A set of interferometric data takes was acquired by the ESAR airborne sensor over a managed pine plantation at Thetford Forest, UK. Scattering phase <b>centre</b> <b>height</b> estimates were made from two single-pass X-band acquisitions and polarimetric repeat-pass L-band acquisitions and compared with height estimates made from a separate LiDAR acquisition. The relationship between the scattering phase centre heights and stand top heights estimated, and the accuracy of stand top height estimates estimated from InSAR and LiDAR is quantified by the root mean square error (rmse). General yield class models by the Forestry Commission (UK) were used to estimate stand top height from a GIS database used for forest management. The longer wavelength L-band radiation penetrates deeper into the canopy than the X-band, and the scattering phase <b>centre</b> <b>height</b> is affected by both forest structural parameters (canopy density, understorey, and gaps) and sensor parameters (look-angle and reduced coherence through temporal and volume decorrelation). Consequently, a simple translation of scattering phase <b>centre</b> <b>height</b> into stand top height gives noisy results for L-band, with observed rmse values between ± 3. 1 m in the near-range and ± 6. 4 m in the far-range. The X-band based top height estimates are more accurate, with rmse between ± 2. 9 m in the near- and ± 4. 1 m in the far-range, which can be further reduced by an empirical incidence angle correction. Stand top height estimates from LiDAR achieved an rmse of only ± 2. 0 m. The X-band scattering phase centre heights have also been related to mean stand height and are comparable with heights observed from the LiDAR sensor and field measurements. An rmse of ± 2. 5 m for the mean stand height estimates based on the X-band dataset was found. Finally, we briefly discuss error propagation from the use of a terrain model, here provided by the Ordnance Survey...|$|E

30|$|The {{application}} of nitrogen (N) fertilizer {{is one of}} the important measures for the improvement of rice grain yields. However, excessive rates of N application are the cause of lodging. In previous studies, high N application rates resulted in poor lodging resistance in rice and wheat by increasing tiller numbers, the length of lower internodes, gravity <b>centre</b> <b>height</b> and plant height and decreasing the dry weight per cm in culms, the leaf sheath strength and the breaking strength (Yang et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013). Shi et al. (2008) showed that the lodging index decreases then increases with N application rates, which means that the risk of lodging risks in rice plants is smallest at a middle N fertilizer rate. Quang Duy et al. (2004) suggests that a sparse planting density accompanied by small amounts of N fertilizer in the early growth stages effectively increases lodging resistance in rice plants.|$|E
30|$|The {{higher the}} lodging index, the more {{susceptible}} the lodging response to N was. For the Wuyunjing 23 cultivar, {{the response of}} the lodging rate in the field and the lodging index to top-dressing N tended to level off. With increasing top-dressing N application rates, the gravity <b>centre</b> <b>height</b> increased slightly but not significantly; however, the plant height increased higher (Table  1). Thus, to a certain extent, the lodging index of rice plants increased (Li et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015). Additionally, compared with LN treatments, the lignified cell walls in the mechanical tissue and vascular bundle sheath regions, which were closely related with stem stiffness, differed little (Figs. 3 and 5). However, the thickness of the mechanical tissue, the ALVB and the ASVB decreased significantly under HN conditions (Fig. 4, Table 2), resulting in a reduction in stem strength. These results were consistent with previous reports by Zhang et al. (2009). In addition, the culm inner diameter (a 2, b 2) increased with higher top-dressing N application rates, which were responsible for larger ratio of medullary cavity and weaker stem strength (Chen et al., 2008).|$|E
40|$|To support {{international}} {{climate change}} mitigation efforts, the United Nations REDD+ initiative (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) seeks to reduce land use induced greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. It requires independent monitoring of forest cover and forest biomass information in a spatially explicit form. It is widely recognised that remote sensing is required to deliver this information. Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry (InSAR) techniques have gained traction {{in the last decade}} as a viable technology from which vegetation canopy height and bare earth elevations can be derived. The viewing geometry of a SAR sensor is side-looking where the radar pulse is transmitted out {{to one side of the}} aircraft or satellite, defining an incidence angle (θ) range. The incidence angle will change from near-range (NR) to far-range (FR) across of the track of the SAR platform. InSAR uses image pairs and thus, contain two set of incidence angles. Changes in the InSAR incidence angles can alter the relative contributions from the vegetation canopy and the ground surface and thus, affect the retrieved vegetation canopy height. Incidence angle change is less pronounced in spaceborne data than in airborne data and mitigated somewhat when multiple InSAR-data takes are combined. This study uses NEXTMap ® single- and multi-pass X-band HH polarized InSAR to derive vegetation canopy height from the scattering phase <b>centre</b> <b>height</b> (h spc). Comparisons with in situ vegetation canopy height over three test sites (Arizona- 1, Minnesota- 2); the effect of incidence angle changes across swath on the X-HH InSAR h spc was examined. Results indicate at steep incidence angles (θ = 35 º), more exposure of lower vegetation canopy structure (e. g. tree trunks) led to greater lower canopy double bounce, increased ground scattering, and decreased volume scattering. This resulted in a lower scattering phase <b>centre</b> <b>height</b> (h spc) or a greater underestimation of vegetation canopy height given by the single-pass X-HH InSAR data. The opposite effect occurs in the far range (θ = 55 º), an increase in volume scattering resulted in more accurate vegetation canopy heights when compared to in situ measurements. These findings indicate that incidence angle corrections should be applied to airborne X-HH single-pass InSAR. In contrast, NEXTMap X-HH (multi-pass data) h spc data experienced little or no effect of incidence angle, possibly because NEXTMap is an aggregation of multi-pass flight line strips, which averages data over several incidence angles. These results may aid in the understanding of potential incidence angle effects in Astrium spaceborne Tandem-X data, which will have global digital surface elevation coverage by 2015...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the design and {{implementation}} of a {{double wishbone front suspension}} for a small vineyard-orchard tractor, developed in conjunction with a major tractor manufacturer. To date there are just medium or heavy weight machines and no small size tractors with independent front suspension on the market. The front suspended axle is recognized as a leading option in improving tractor ride performance on larger vehicles. Moreover, despite their narrow track, vineyard-orchard tractors are required to have good lateral and slope stability (i. e. at least 28 deg rollover angle) and an extremely tight turning diameter (less than 7 m). The design analysis is based on retrofitting an existing vehicle with a double wishbone front suspension. The design process, with all related issues, was conducted in collaboration with the vehicle manufacturer. Specification of the suspension pick-up points was determined by means of an iterative process using CAE design and kinematic analysis. Results show that such an improvement is feasible. The final kinematic turning diameter is about 6. 4 m, with a ± 65 mm suspension travel available. The roll <b>centre</b> <b>height</b> value is not very sensitive to steering (about 95 mm excursion), therefore offering slope stability in extreme turning manoeuvres...|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE Recent {{evidence}} indicates {{that the rate of}} lung function decline is steepest in mild COPD and slower in moderate to severe COPD. The current study assessed whether lung function decline relates to baseline airflow obstruction severity in male heavy smokers. METHODS In total, 2, 003 male smokers with a mean (SD) age of 59. 8 (5. 3) years underwent pulmonary function testing at baseline and after 3 year follow-up. Participants were classified by entry FEV(1) /FVC as follows: Group 1, > 70 %; Group 2, LLN; and group 3, <LLN. Differences in lung function decline among the groups were assessed using multiple regression after adjustment for packyears, smoking status (current/former smoker), presence/absence of mucus production, <b>centre,</b> <b>height,</b> age, CT-derived emphysema severity (Perc 15), observation time (years in study) and the baseline values. RESULTS Over three years, the mean (SD) FEV(1) /FVC, FEV(1) and MEF(50) decreases in Group 1 were 3. 1 % (1), 0. 21 L (0. 07) and a 0. 40 L/s (0. 26), respectively. In Group 3, these decreases were 2. 4 % (1. 1), 0. 15 L (0. 08) and 0. 06 L/s (0. 19), respectively. All lung function parameters showed the greatest decline in Group 1 (p< 0. 001). CONCLUSION Diagnosing COPD based on the presence of more severe airflow obstruction (as defined by FEV(1) /FVC <LLN) means that, at the time of such a diagnosis, subjects passed the phase of strong lung function decline...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of sex steroids on calcaneal quantitative ultrasound (QUS) parameters was assessed {{in a population}} sample of middle-aged and elderly European men. Higher free and total E- 2 though not testosterone, were independently associated with higher QUS parameters. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the association between QUS parameters and sex steroids in middle-aged and elderly European men. Three thousand one hundred forty-one men aged between 40 and 79 years were recruited from eight European centres for participation in a study of male ageing: the European Male Ageing Study. Subjects were invited by letter to attend for an interviewer-administered questionnaire, blood sample and QUS of the calcaneus (Hologic-SAHARA). Blood was assessed for sex steroids including oestradiol (E- 2), testosterone (T), free and bio-available E- 2 and T and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Serum total T was not associated with any of the QUS parameters. Free T and both free and total E- 2 were positively related to all QUS readings, while SHBG concentrations were negatively associated. These relationships were observed in both older and younger (< 60 years) men. In a multivariate model, after adjustment for age, <b>centre,</b> <b>height,</b> weight, physical activity levels and smoking, free E- 2 and SHBG, though not free T, remained independently associated with the QUS parameters. After further adjustment for IGF- 1, however, the association with SHBG became non-significant. Higher free and total E- 2 are associated with bone health not only among the elderly but also middle-aged European men...|$|E

40|$|Raman lidar data {{obtained}} over a 1 year period has been analysed {{in relation to}} aerosol layers in the free troposphere over the Highveld in South Africa. In total, 375 layers were observed above the boundary layer during the period 30 January 2010 to 31 January 2011. The seasonal behaviour of aerosol layer geometrical characteristics, as well as intensive and extensive optical properties were studied. The highest centre heights of free-tropospheric layers were observed during the South African spring (2520 ± 970 m a. g. l., also elsewhere). The geometrical layer depth {{was found to be}} maximum during spring, while it did not show any significant difference {{for the rest of the}} seasons. The variability of the analysed intensive and extensive optical properties was high during all seasons. Layers were observed at a mean <b>centre</b> <b>height</b> of 2100 ± 1000 m with an average lidar ratio of 67 ± 25 sr (mean value with 1 standard deviation) at 355 nm and a mean extinction-related Ångström exponent of 1. 9 ± 0. 8 between 355 and 532 nm during the period under study. Except for the intensive biomass burning period from August to October, the lidar ratios and Ångström exponents are within the range of previous observations for urban/industrial aerosols. During Southern Hemispheric spring, the biomass burning activity is clearly reflected in the optical properties of the observed free-tropospheric layers. Specifically, lidar ratios at 355 nm were 89 ± 21, 57 ± 20, 59 ± 22 and 65 ± 23 sr during spring (September–November), summer (December–February), autumn (March–May) and winter (June–August), respectively. The extinction-related Ångström exponents between 355 and 532 nm measured during spring, summer, autumn and winter were 1. 8 ± 0. 6, 2. 4 ± 0. 9, 1. 8 ± 0. 9 and 1. 8 ± 0. 6, respectively. The mean columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD) obtained from lidar measurements was found to be 0. 46 ± 0. 35 at 355 nm and 0. 25 ± 0. 2 at 532 nm. The contribution of free-tropospheric aerosols on the AOD had a wide range of values with a mean contribution of 46 %...|$|E
