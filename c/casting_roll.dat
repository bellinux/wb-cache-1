40|$|Melt {{extruded}} poly(vinylidene fluoride) cast {{films were}} prepared at different <b>cast</b> <b>roll</b> temperatures and speeds {{to study the}} effect of casting temperature and preorientation of the melt on the alpha- to beta-phase transformation in these films after uniaxial stretching. X-ray and {{fourier transform infrared spectroscopy}} were used to identify the crystalline phases. The unstretched films were characterized using small angle light scattering (SALS). The films were stretched to a stretch ratio of 4. 2 and at 80 degrees C. Birefringence of the films and the fraction of beta-phase [F(beta) ] formed after uniaxial stretching increased with stretch ratio. The films showed increased crystallinity after stretching. For the films prepared at different <b>cast</b> <b>roll</b> temperatures, there was little change in F(beta) in the films having a <b>cast</b> <b>roll</b> temperature between 75 and 120 degrees C, but for the film with a <b>cast</b> <b>roll</b> temperature of 130 degrees C F(beta) decreased considerably. For the films prepared at different <b>cast</b> <b>roll</b> speeds, the F(beta) increased with stretch ratio as well as with <b>cast</b> <b>roll</b> speed for a fixed stretch ratio. The primary effect of changing both the parameters is a change in the average spherulitic radius (R), in the unstretched films measured using SALS. The F(beta) obtained correlated well with R and lower spherulitic radii resulted in the higher conversion to the beta-phase. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 47 : 1992 - 2004, 2007.

The continuous <b>casting</b> <b>roll</b> was analysed via the degradation phenomena which act during the operation. Four kinds of filler materials were used for the renovation of the worn roll. Surfacing was carried out as a three-layer in order to eliminate the need for intermediate layer formation. The quality of weld deposits was evaluated in terms of the structure, hardness and wear resistance of weld deposits at 23 °C and 400 °C using pin-on-disc wear test.

40|$|Peritectic carbon steels, {{produced}} by conventional continuous casting, show slab surface defects {{as a consequence}} of the shrinkage caused by the delta-gamma transformation. Unsteady heat flux conditions between strand shell and mould plate leads to an irregular solidification. By following the hypothesis, that the cooling rate has an effect to the peritectic reaction, twin roll strip cast trials were done at a pilot strip caster at RWTH Aachen University. Local cooling rates of - 1000 K/s in combination with an eightfold higher heat flux compared to continuous casting are typical for strip casting process. The indication for effects from the strip casting process to the peritectic reaction was on the one hand the steady heat flux and on the other hand the strip surface quality. Trials were performed in 3 campaigns with the chemical analyses of peritectic carbon steels known from continuous casting. The campaigns just distinguish between the <b>casting</b> <b>roll</b> surfaces structure and the range of carbon content. All other process parameters were constant. The <b>casting</b> <b>roll</b> surface was developed from a fine, hexagonal open structure to a coarse hexagonal structure. The structure is regular and was {{produced by}} knurling. The carbon range was 0. 06 to 0. 17 wt %. The result of the 1 st campaign was that nearly all strips were attack by many cracks. The number of cracks rises to higher carbon content up to 0. 17 wt %. The maximum of defects around 0. 1 wt % of carbon, known from continuous casting, was not found. By proofing the strip surfaces, it was found out that the steel melt didn’t wet the roll surface intensive. An unsteady solidification process was the result. The results of the 2 nd campaign were different. Just very few cracks were remaining at the strip surfaces. No dependence between carbon content and number of crack were found. Once again the critical range around 0. 1 wt % carbon wasn’t noticeable by strips produced with the twin roll casting process. The important different in comparison to the first campaign was an excellent wetting behaviour between steel melt and roll surface. An imprint of the roll surface structure was found at all strip surfaces. A homogenous heat flux and solidification condition exists. The results of the 3 rd series, performed with a further regular roll surface structure, confirm the above explained facts. The geometric shape and adjustment were again diversifying to coarser values. The work could demonstrate that the twin roll process is suitable for the production of peritectic carbon steel grades. The key factor for solidification and heat flux is the wetting condition at the roll surface. Steel specific roll surface structures are required...|$|E

40|$|Continuous <b>casting</b> <b>rolls</b> are {{subjected}} to extreme temperature fl uctuations and harsh environmental conditions during service. High slab contact pressures, high surface temperatures, adhesive or abrasive wear by slag or oxides and thermal fatigue all contribute towards deterioration of the roll surface. Rolls may also suffer surface degradation {{as a result of}} corrosion. The slab is cooled using water spray, often containing hydrofl uoric acid as product of the reaction between water and the mould fl ux powder used to keep the molten metal from adhering to the copper mould plate. This results in an aggressive low pH environment that may promote pitting or crevice corrosion and stress corrosion cracking failures. In order to prolong the life of continuous <b>casting</b> <b>rolls</b> in service, the rolls are surfaced using martensitic stainless steel weld cladding. After surfacing, the roll may be given a post-weld heat treatment to temper the martensite to the required hardness level, or to relieve thermally-induced stresses.

40|$|Abstract. Profile Strip Casting is {{a process}} {{combining}} the advantages of tailored products with those of twin-roll strip casting. The feasibility of this process has been experimentally demonstrated and a profile with a thickness difference of one millimeter across the strip width could be obtained in a stable process. However, the dimensional precision and the properties uniformity along the {{cross section of the}} produced strip were not satisfactory. In this paper, two different strategies for the improvement of the profiled strip quality are presented. The first concept focuses on the variation of the geometrical parameters of the profile. Its application allowed to cast a strip with a thickness of 1. 5 mm in the thin and 2. 0 mm in the thick profile section maintaining the absolute geometrical error over the whole strip under 0. 1 mm and improving the internal microstructural homogeneity. The second approach identifies the precise control of the heat transfer occurring between <b>casting</b> <b>roll</b> and melt as the key factor to further improve the final profiled strip quality and will be implemented by selectively coating the casting rolls. The simulations performed show that the temperature difference between the cores of the thin and thick sections at the exit of the casting gap will be reduced by 60 % in the considered test case...|$|E
40|$|Research {{in organic}} {{semiconductor}} materials and devices {{has increased dramatically}} in the last decade, particularly in the photovoltaics field. Organic based solar cells with record power conversion efficiencies of 8 % to 9 % have recently been reported, and future expectations for organic solar cell power conversion efficiencies are believed to approach 15 %. Organic semiconductors hold interest due to their flexible mechanical properties {{and their ability to}} be solution processed. Processing techniques such as: spin coating, drop <b>casting,</b> <b>roll</b> painting, and ink jet printing can be readily used to deposit dissolved solutions of polymers and fullerenes to create organic solar cells. One novel, minimally researched solution processing technique for the deposition of polymer and fullerene solutions is paint brushing. Current research on paintbrushed solar cells has shown that solar cell efficiencies close to 5 % can be obtained from active layer paint brushing on heated indium-tin-oxide covered glass substrates. In this study, organic solar cells are fabricated from P 3 HT and PCBM in chlorobenzene solution via paint brushing technique. Unlike previous studies, no heat treatment is applied to P 3 HT:PCBM active layers during or after device production. Paint-brushed devices are compared to spin-coated devices fabricated from the same P 3 HT:PCBM chlorobenzene solution in an effort to further investigate why paint-brushed solar cell devices perform better than non-annealed, spin-coated solar cell devices. Results from a full device characterization process including light current-voltage measurements, dark current-voltage measurements, active layer absorbance measurements, and external quantum efficiency measurements for both paint-brushed and spin-coated devices will be shown and discussed. Atomic Force Microscopy is used to provide active layer thickness data and film morphology information for both paint-brushed and spin-coated devices.

40|$|In era of dwindling {{fossil fuel}} supplies, {{increasing}} energy demand and {{high rates of}} carbon emission, investment in the clean and renewable-energy market is now the goal of many governments. This global prospect pushes the countries to consolidate new policies and rules to increase the production of cost-eﬀective resources and grow the deployment in renewable energy. Sunlight, wind, waves and geothermal heat are the natural energy resources that strongly contribute to our global energy consumption. Organic materials - restricted to those that have conjugated structure and exhibit semiconducting properties - have gained intense interest in research and academia, leading to eﬃcient and commercially applicable devices. Organic photovoltaic (OPV), organic ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors (OFETs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are the most prominent devices in the ﬁeld of organic electronics. These devices are promising due to potentially low cost, mechanical ﬂexibility, lightweight as well as high and ease of processability from solution (such as, spin-coating, drop <b>casting,</b> <b>roll</b> painting, and ink jet printing). Signiﬁcant improvements have been achieved - especially for OLEDs, which have now been commercialized for cellular telephone applications as well as high-deﬁnition television screens. For OPVs, however, inferior performance and short lifetimes hinder their successful commercialization. The work presented in this dissertation focuses on three diﬀerent performance-related issues and strategies for OPVs; electrode-interface engineering, morphology tuning, and optical absorption enhancement. The work on morphology tuning is also extended and applied to OLEDs and OFETs. In chapter one, a schematic showing the organization of this dissertation is presented. In the same chapter, a general introduction on organic materials and thin-ﬁlms is also discussed. Furthermore, the architecture and basic operation of OPV, OFET and OLED devices are considered. Chapter two discusses the possibility of fabricating new OPV devices on previously used Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) substrates, which went through prior device processing with popular acidic interfacial layer poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) :poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). We show that, contrary to the concerns in the literature, only the top few nanometers of ITO are etched by PEDOT:PSS in typical device processing and storage thereafter. Conductivity losses are oﬀset by transmission gains leading to an increased power conversion eﬃciencies (PCE) for PTB 7 -based (PTB 7 : poly[[4, 8 -bis[(2 -ethylhexyl) oxy]benzo[1, 2 -b: 4, 5 -b’]dithiophene- 2, 6 -diyl][3 - ﬂuoro- 2 -[(2 -ethylhexyl) carbonyl]thieno[3, 4 -b]thiophenediyl]]) OPVs on used ITO substrates compared to devices on fresh ITO. In chapter three, we introduce a generic morphology tuning technique with anisotropic applicability -exposure to static electric-ﬁeld (E-ﬁeld) gradient during the solidiﬁcation of solution-processed polymeric thin-ﬁlms. This technique improves the connectivity between polymer chains; by changing the E-ﬁeld direction, radiative pathways in polymeric thin-ﬁlms can be altered, charge transport in- and out-of-plane can be improved, and phase-separation in polymer-fullerene blends can be coarsened in the bulk and perpendicular to the substrate. In exemplary cases, we improved the hole mobility in OFETs, power conversion eﬀciency in OPVs, and electroluminescence eﬃciency in OLEDs. In {{the last part of}} this dissertation, we studied the eﬀect of using microlens array (MLA) to increase the light absorption inside the active-layer of OPVs. Our MLA approach does not hinder the fabrication of the OPV because MLA lies on the non-conductive side of the ITO glass. In chapter four, we initially investigated the eﬀect of using MLA with 2000 nm feature size. We found that thick (P 3 HT:PCBM) and thin (PCDTBT:PCBM) OPVs exhibit an improved short-circuit current. This enhancement stems from the increased light path coupled with the constructive interference patterns inside the OPV photoactive layer. In chapter ﬁve, we used MLAs with smaller feature sizes. In addition to feature size of 2 micrometer, 1. 5 micrometer, 1 micrometer and 0. 6 micrometer MLAs were also investigated. The experimental and simulations results show agreement on an increased light absorption inside the photoactive layer; improved current-density and PCE were realized for PTB 7 :PCBM and PCDTBT:PCBM OPVs (w. r. t. control) using 1 micrometer and 1. 5 micrometer feature size MLAs, respectively...|$|E

30|$|Burns from {{orthopaedic}} {{plaster cast}} splints, although not common occurrences, {{have been reported}} [5, 6, 11]. Previous investigators have evaluated the exothermic properties of plaster or synthetic casting materials separately. Ganaway and Hunter [12] and Lavalette and Pope [1] demonstrated plaster could, under the right set of conditions, create temperatures {{at or above the}} burn threshold. Synthetic materials, however, have a smaller exothermic potential and even under the worst conditions did not create dangerous temperatures [2]. The important variables identified in previous studies which influenced the temperatures generated have been cast thickness, dip water temperature, type of casting material, and the presence of an insulator (pillow) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13]. Deignan et al. [14] were even able to show that pressure applied during themolding of casts results in a significant increase in temperature at the side where the mold was applied. Variables of lesser importance included the amount of cast padding, the room humidity, the room temperature, and the use of previously used dip water. Haasch [5] emphasized that when the <b>cast</b> <b>rolls</b> are soaked in hot water, they absorb water at a slower rate than when they are soaked in cold water. Also, if the <b>cast</b> <b>rolls</b> are dipped in water {{for a short period of}} time, they absorb less water. When less water is present in the <b>cast</b> <b>rolls,</b> the temperature of the cast increases. The specific heat capacity of water of 4, 190  J/kg K is very high, which means the more water is present, the more of a cooling effect the water has on the temperature of the cast.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Conventional {{production}} process of magnesium alloy strips involves many steps, including multi-hot rolling and multi-heat treatment, which is time-consuming and needs high energy cost. By use of thin strip casting, magnesium alloy cast strip with a thickness {{of less than}} 8 mm can be produced and then rolled to the strip of the needed thickness, which is a short, energy saving and high effective process. In this paper, development of magnesium alloy strips prepared by single and twin <b>roll</b> <b>casting</b> has been summarized.

Magnesium alloy strips prepared by single <b>roll</b> <b>casting</b> are suitable for Mg-based functional materials but not for structural materials because of low quality or high cost.

40|$|The {{results of}} the {{investigation}} of the influence {{of the size of the}} strip electrode on the dilution of the base metal used in the process of submerged arc hardfacing of continuous <b>casting</b> <b>rolls</b> are presented. Increasing the thickness and decreasing the width of the strip electrode (60 ´ 0, 5 mm, 45 ´ 0, 7 mm, 30 ´ 1, 0 mm) results in the changing of the shape and dimensions of the fusion zone of the base metal to enhance the depth and reduce the non-uniformity of fusion penetration. The experimental data show that the dilution ratio of the base metal using the strip electrode 45 ´ 0, 7  mm, containing 13, 5  % chromium, made it possible to obtain more than 11  % chromium in the chemical composition of the third deposited layer. In the process of submerged arc hardfacing increasing the travel speed of the strip electrode (heat source) up to 12 m/hour enhance the dilution ratio of the base metal.

40|$|Purpose: : The {{purpose of}} the work is to {{establish}} a manufacturing process and technology to facilitate the economical manufacture of high-quality magnesium sheet alloys. Design/methodology/approach: Magnesium alloy AZ 31 B was used to investigate the appropriate manufacturing conditions for use in twin-roll strip casting. Temperatures of the molten materials and roll speeds were varied to find the appropriate manufacturing conditions. The effects of manufacturing conditions on possible forming were clarified in terms of roll speeds and roll gaps between upper and lower rolls. Findings: In the hot-rolling process, a temperature exceeding 200 °C was chosen to keep cast products from cracking. An appropriate annealing temperature was effective for homogenizing the microstructure of the <b>rolled</b> <b>cast</b> sheets after the strip casting process. The grain size of the manufactured wrought magnesium alloys sheet was less than 10 micrometers. The obtained magnesium alloy sheet exhibited an equivalent limiting drawing ratio in a warm-drawing test. Research limitations/implications: AZ 31 were used to investigate the appropriate manufacturing conditions for use in twin-roll strip casting. Casting temperatures were varied from 630 °C to 670 °C to find the best <b>casting</b> conditions. <b>Roll</b> <b>casting</b> speeds were varied from 5 m/min to 30 m/min in order to examine which roll speed was appropriate for solidifying the molten magnesium. Practical implications: It was found that the cast magnesium sheet manufactured by <b>roll</b> strip <b>casting</b> could be used for plastic forming if the appropriate magnesium sheets were produced after the <b>roll</b> <b>casting</b> process. Originality/value: This paper showed the effectiveness of twin <b>roll</b> <b>casting</b> for magnesium alloys by a horizontal roll caster...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{two-dimensional}} {{finite element}} analysis was adopted to predict temperature distribution and roll separation force during twin <b>roll</b> <b>casting</b> of A 7075 aluminum alloy strip. The influence of various parameters such as roll speed, initial temperature of the melt and heat transfer coefficient on temperature distribution and roll separation force was investigated in detail. The results were useful to comprehensively understand the casting process and to effectively reduce the experimental trial-and-error procedures of twin <b>roll</b> <b>casting</b> process...|$|R

An electromagnetic purification system was installed in a twin <b>roll</b> <b>casting</b> line {{in order to improve}} the molten metal cleanliness. Metallographic analysis shows that inclusion particles larger than 10 µm can be eliminated from molten aluminum by electromagnetic purification and a total inclusion removal efficiency of 75 % is achieved additional to the filtration by a ceramic foam filter. The electromagnetic purification system operated reliably and consistently during the casting campaign...|$|R
