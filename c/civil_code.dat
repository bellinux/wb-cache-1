For instance, the Turkish <b>Civil</b> <b>Code</b> has been modified by incorporating elements mainly of the Swiss <b>Civil</b> <b>Code</b> and Code of Obligations, and the German Commercial Code. The Administrative Code bears similarities with its French counterpart, and the Penal Code with its Italian counterpart.|$|E

50|$|<b>Civil</b> <b>codes</b> are {{sometimes}} {{also found in}} common law systems, especially in the United States of America.

40|$|The Arab codes {{give the}} law of {{obligations}} the prominent place it occupies in the civil law system. These codes recognize (liberative or negative) prescription {{as a mode of}} barring claims as a result of inaction for a period of time. In addition, the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts of 2004 (PICC 2004) provides that prescription extinguishes an action to enforce a claim of right. The {{purpose of this article is}} to conduct a comparative exercise by analyzing similarities and differences between Arab <b>civil</b> <b>codes</b> and the PICC 2004. Arab <b>civil</b> <b>codes</b> and the PICC 2004 wrestle with the same concept, prescription, in more or less the same terms. However, the value of studying the PICC 2004 along with Arab <b>civil</b> <b>codes</b> is even greater because they do differ. The article concludes by arguing that certain prescription provisions in Arab <b>civil</b> <b>codes</b> are unclear and antiquated. Arab countries can reconcile their <b>civil</b> <b>codes</b> with more recent international legal instruments, such as the PICC 2004, without jeopardizing their own traditions and values...|$|R

Communal tensions were played upon especially in Uttar Pradesh and the states of Northeast India.

5|$|Historically {{influenced}} by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki. However, {{since the late}} 19th century the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. For example, in 1896, the Japanese government established a <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> based on {{a draft of the}} German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch; with the code remaining in effect with post–World War II modifications. Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature and has the rubber stamp of the Emperor. Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.|$|E

Under Arkansas <b>Civil</b> <b>Code</b> sec. 525, if a person usurps an office or franchise to which he is not entitled, an action at law may be instituted against him either by the State or by the party rightly entitled to the office. On October 8, 1873, Baxter filed a plea of non-jurisdiction, but he believed that the court might decide against him. He issued a telegram to President Grant informing him of the basic situation in Arkansas and asked for federal troops to help him maintain the peace. Grant denied his request.|$|E
5|$|Per , {{state and}} union governments, as duty, shall make further {{detailed}} policies and laws for implementation considering DPSPs as fundamental policy.

Judiciary can repeal any policy/law devised by the government which is diametrically opposite to any DPSP.|$|E
5|$|The Jana Sangh's {{first major}} campaign, begun in early 1953, centred on {{a demand for}} the {{complete}} integration of Jammu and Kashmir into India. Mookerjee was arrested in May 1953 for violating orders from the state government restraining him from entering Kashmir. He {{died of a heart}} attack the following month, while still in jail. Mauli Chandra Sharma was elected to succeed Mookerjee; however, he was forced out of power by the RSS activists within the party, and the leadership went instead to Upadhyaya. Upadhyay remained the General Secretary until 1967, and worked to build a committed grassroots organisation in the image of the RSS. The party minimised engagement with the public, focusing instead on building its network of propagandists. Upadhyaya also articulated the philosophy of integral humanism, which formed the official doctrine of the party. Younger leaders, such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani also became involved with the leadership in this period, with Vajpayee succeeding Upadhyaya as president in 1968. The major themes on the party's agenda during this period were legislating a uniform <b>civil</b> <b>code,</b> banning cow slaughter and abolishing the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir.|$|E

5|$|The {{implementation}} of a uniform <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> for all citizens has not been achieved owing to widespread opposition from various religious groups and political parties. The Shah Bano case (1985–86) provoked a political firestorm in India when the Supreme Court ruled that Shah Bano, a Muslim {{woman who had been}} divorced by her husband in 1978 was entitled to receive alimony from her former husband under Indian law applicable for all Indian women. This decision evoked outrage in the Muslim community, which sought the application of the Muslim personal law and in response the Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 overturning the Supreme Court's verdict. This act provoked further outrage, as jurists, critics and politicians alleged that the fundamental right of equality for all citizens irrespective of religion or gender was being jettisoned to preserve the interests of distinct religious communities. The verdict and the legislation remain a source of heated debate, with many citing the issue as a prime example of the poor {{implementation of}} Fundamental Rights.|$|E

Copyright legislation was originally planned to be included in part III of this new <b>Civil</b> <b>Code.</b> Several drafts for new chapters on copyrights were prepared, but the matter proved so difficult that part III of the <b>Civil</b> <b>Code</b> was delayed several times.

25|$|After Taiwan was seceded to Japan in 1895, The <b>Civil</b> <b>Code</b> of Japan {{was created}} in 1896.

Those on family and succession retain certain vestiges of the old patriarchal family system that was the basis of Japanese feudalism. It was in these sections that most of the postwar revisions were made. At that time it was considered no longer necessary or desirable to pay such homage to the past, and the sections dealing with family law and succession were brought closer to European civil law. This law was applied to Taiwan.|$|E
