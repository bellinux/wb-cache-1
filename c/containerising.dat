The recent boom of big data, coupled with the challenges of its processing and storage gave rise to the development of distributed data processing and storage paradigms like MapReduce, Spark, and NoSQL databases. With the advent of cloud computing, processing and storing such massive datasets on clusters of machines is now feasible with ease. However, there are limited tools and approaches, which users can rely on to gauge and comprehend the performance of their big data applications deployed locally on clusters, or in the cloud. Researchers have started exploring this area by providing benchmarking suites suitable for big data applications. However, many of these tools are fragmented, complex to deploy and manage, and do not provide transparency with respect to the monetary cost of benchmarking an application. In this paper, we present Plug And Play Bench (PAPB 1) : aninfrastructure aware abstraction built to integrate and simplifythe deployment of big data benchmarking tools on clusters of machines. PAPB automates the tedious process of installing, configuring and executing common big data benchmark work-loads by <b>containerising</b> the tools and settings based on the underlying cluster deployment framework. Our proof of concept implementation utilises HiBench as the benchmark suite, HDP as the cluster deployment framework and Azure as the cloud platform.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the need for}} legal uniformity in the current field of international <b>containerised</b> multimodal transport, focusing on two parameters: a) the recognition of international <b>containerised</b> transport as a uniform and single transport process, entitled to its own legal framework and b) the reconsideration of {{the legal status of}} operators of transport terminals so as to bring their liability under a legal framework for international <b>containerised</b> transport. Thus, it {{examines the}} particularities of containerisation providing a general overview of the innovations it brought to the global distribution of cargo; discusses its interaction with international multimodal transport placing emphasis on the key role of terminal operators; looks at the legal framework of international <b>containerised</b> multimodal transport indicating that although it is a heavily integrated transport field, yet its legal framework remains disproportionately disharmonised; and finally examines the fragile legal status of terminal operators in international <b>containerised</b> transport to conclude that the regulation of terminal operators' liability should be fall within an overall effort to establish harmonised liability rules applicable throughout the entire international <b>containerised</b> transport.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is supported by}} the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Education Research Grant. Cloud computing providers have recently begun offering container instances, which provide an efficient route to application deployment within a lightweight, isolated and well-defined execution environment. Cloud providers currently offer Container Service Platforms (CSPs), which support the flexible orchestration of <b>containerised</b> applications. Existing CSP frameworks do not offer any form of intelligent resource scheduling: applications are usually scheduled individually,rather than taking a holistic view of all registered applications and available resources in the cloud. This can result in increased execution times for applications, resource wastage through underutilized container-instances, and a {{reduction in the number of}} applications that can be deployed, given the available resources. This paper presents a cloud-based Container Management Service(CMS) framework, which offers increased deployment density, scalability and resource efficiency for <b>containerised</b> applications. CMS extends the state-of-the-art by providing additional functionalities for orchestrating <b>containerised</b> applications by joint optimisation of sets of <b>containerised</b> applications and resource pool on the cloud. We evaluate CMS on a cloud-based CSP i. e., Amazon EC 2 Container Management Service (ECS) and conducted extensive experiments using sets of CPU and Memory intensive <b>containerised</b> applications against the direct deployment strategy of Amazon ECS. The results show that CMS achieves up to 25 % higher cluster utilisation and up to 2. 5 times faster execution times. Postprin...|$|R

50|$|Indian Railway's {{strategic}} {{initiative to}} <b>containerise</b> cargo transport put India on the intermodal freight transport map {{for the first}} time in 1966. Given India's size (almost 3000 km from North to South and East to West), rail transport is often a cheaper option for all cargo over medium and long distances, especially if the cost of inter-modal transfers can be reduced. Seeing that <b>containerised</b> multi-modal door-to-door transport provided a solution to this problem, in 1966 Indian Railways entered the market for moving door-to-door domestic cargo in special DSO containers.|$|R

40|$|Growing {{number of}} {{hazardous}} goods are being carried in containers at sea. The carriage of <b>Containerised</b> Dangerous Goods by sea {{is governed by}} the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code. International Maritime Organisation (IMO) introduced the IMDG Code in the year 1965 to provide an International Standard of Safety for "Safe Transport of <b>Containerised</b> Dangerous Goods". The IMDG Code has attained mandatory status since 1 ^^ January 2004. Despite an International Code aimed at tightening safety, the shipping community is still beset with problems like misdeclaration and nondeclaration of hazardous goods, poorly trained shore staff, lack of awareness of the IMDG Code, incorrect stowage and non-compliance of packing/labelling/marking/placarding regulations. Container inspection programmes carried out in various countries, reported to IMO, demonstrate deficiencies as high as 40 %. This research highlights need for personnel involved in the carriage of dangerous goods shipments to be fully trained. Hazardous seminars are being carried out globally to enhance awareness of the IMDG Code. There have been nine major fires involving <b>containerised</b> dangerous goods in the past. The research {{draws attention to the}} risk of hazardous incidents involving ships carrying <b>containerised</b> dangerous goods. It supports IMO's objectives for safer ships on cleaner oceans to reduce risk of accidents and pollution. The {{fact that there is a}} cavalier attitude to regulations should cause serious concern to those handling dangerous goods. It is attributed that 80 % of accidents are caused due to human error. The industry should recognise that there is a clear need of creating better work environments. On the whole, the proposal is for a safety management approach that simply formalises good practice, bearing in mind the number of shippers whose cargoes might contribute to an incident involving dangerous goods and to encourage "Safe Transport of <b>Containerised</b> Dangerous Goods" worldwide...|$|R
