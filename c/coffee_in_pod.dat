50|$|In 1993, {{the three}} {{engineering}} entrepreneurs from a Massachusetts start-up called Keurig had approached GMCR about developing a single-cup coffee brewing system, and Green Mountain had first {{invested in the}} nascent company at that time. In 1996 GMCR invested further in Keurig, buying a 35% interest in the company. In 1997, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters became the first roaster to offer <b>coffee</b> <b>in</b> a K-Cup <b>pod</b> for the Keurig Single-Cup Brewing System, and in 1998 Keurig delivered its first brewing system, designed for office use. The launch of the first K-Cups with Green Mountain Coffee helped GMCR begin to further compete with the ubiquitous presence of Starbucks, by allowing people to brew their own single servings of premium coffee.|$|R

40|$|Pod {{shattering}} resistance index (SRI) is a {{key factor}} affecting the mechanical harvesting of rapeseed. Research on the differences <b>in</b> <b>pod</b> shattering resistance levels of various rapeseed varieties can provide a theoretical basis for varietal breeding and application in mechanical harvesting. The indicators on pod shattering resistance including pod morphology and wall components were evaluated on eight hybrids and open pollinators, respectively, during 2012 - 2014. The results showed the following: (1) From the current study, SRI varied greatly with variety, and conventional varieties had stronger resistance than hybrid according to the physiological indexes. and (2) Under the experimental conditions, the SRI was linearly related to pod wall weight and the water content <b>in</b> <b>pod</b> walls, and the goodness-of-fit measurements for the regression model of the SRI based on pod wall weight and water content were 0. 584 ** and 0. 377 *, respectively, reaching the significant level. This illustrated that pod wall weight and the water content <b>in</b> <b>pod</b> walls determined the SRI. (3) Compared with the relative contents of biochemical components <b>in</b> <b>pod</b> walls, the contents of particular biochemical components <b>in</b> <b>pod</b> walls had closer correlations with SRI. Among the biochemical components, the hemicellulose content was the decisive factor for the SRI...|$|R
