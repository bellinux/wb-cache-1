40|$|Cryovolcanism {{has played}} an {{important}} role in the geological histories of many icy satellites. Cryovolcanism, like the more familiar silicate volcanism on Earth and the other terrestrial planets, takes many forms. Many individual cryovolcanic landforms are morphologically surprisingly similar to terrestrial volcanic landforms and can be explained with similar mechanisms. However, assemblages of cryovolcanic, tectonic, and impact structures form unique and varied landscapes quite alien in their collective expression. Many variables can affect the cryovolcanic style of a satellite but none more so than cryolava composition. This work considers the <b>compositional</b> <b>variable</b> in considerable detail. This work summarises existing knowledge of phase equilibria and physical properties of cosmochemically relevant unary, binary, and multi-component chemical systems, and where published knowledge was found lacking, the author presents his own measurements of the physical chemistry of volatile mixtures. The author then takes the reader on a brief tour of cryovolcanic landscapes, and applies knowledge of the physical chemistry of volatile mixtures to problems of cryovolcanological interest. Aqueous cryolavas may range in composition from salt-water brines to cryogenic ammonia-water-rich multi-component solutions possibly involving methanol, ammonium sulfide, alkali chlorides, and many other potential components. Cryomagmatic distillation can greatly accentuate the importance of trace and minor constituents of icy satellites. The viscosities, densities, and other physical properties of these liquids vary considerably and depend sensitively on their exact compositions. These properties affect everything from cryovolcanic eruptive styles and landforms, to the way cryovolcanic crusts respond to tectonic stresses. It is believed that the <b>compositional</b> <b>variable</b> is directly or indirectly implicated in a wide variety of geomorphic aspects of contrast among the icy satellites. Thus, even though we can not as yet confidently attribute any specific morphology to a specific composition (for lack of in situ compositional analyses), there appears to be a powerful link between the composition of the ices originally accreted by a satellite and its subsequent interior evolution and exterior geomorphic appearance...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} data {{analysis}} {{for a set}} of elastic constant measurements is applied to data bases for wood and cancellous bone. For these materials the identification of the type of elastic symmetry is complicated by the variable composition of the material. The data analysis method permits the identification of the type of elastic symmetry to be accomplished independent of the examination of the variable composition. This method of analysis may be applied to any set of elastic constant measurements, but is illustrated here by application to hardwoods and softwoods, and to an extraordinary data base of cancellous bone elastic constants. The solid volume fraction or bulk density is the <b>compositional</b> <b>variable</b> for the elastic constants of these natural materials. The final results are the solid volume fraction dependent orthotropic Hooke's law for cancellous bone and a bulk density dependent one for hardwoods and softwoods...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Although water {{controls}} the biology and geology of the surface, hydrogen {{is perhaps the}} most poorly constrained <b>compositional</b> <b>variable</b> in the bulk Earth. Its concentration in the upper mantle appears to be controlled by its solubility as hydroxyl in the nominally anhydrous silicate phases, olivine, pyroxene, garnet, wadsleyite, and ringwoodite. Here we describe a series of experiments showing that the solubility of H 2 O in olivine at 12 GPa increases with temperature to 8900 ppm by weight at 1250 °C and decreases at higher temperature with the onset of melting. Sample characterization by infrared spectroscopy indicates that the primary hydration mechanism is the substitution of 2 H+ for Mg 2 +. Similar results obtained from samples coexisting with clinohumite (low-silica) and with clinoenstatite (high-silica) indicate that silica activity has minimal effect on hydration under these conditions. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements constrain the volume of hydration and indicate significant M-site vacancies. Hydrogen thus appears to become a geochemically compatible element as depths approac...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Both {{static and}} dynamic {{properties}} were determined {{for a number}} of rubbery vulcanizates. Selected compositional, processing, de-sign, and testing variables have been evaluated and discussed for a group of general-purpose elastomers, with emphasis on natural rubber (NR) and styrene-butadiene (SBR) compositions. <b>Compositional</b> <b>variables</b> such as carbon black, plasticizer, and curing system have an important influence on dynamic properties and some <b>compositional</b> <b>variables</b> selectively influence either the dynamic stiffness or damping characteristics. Variations in mixing are also shown to influence dynamic properties critically, especially at low testing strains. Cure time variations cause different dynamic responses as a function of elastomer type (NR versus SBR). Design in-fluences on both static and dynamic properties are described. Increasing static preload in compression tests causes an increase in both the spring rate and the damping coefficient. The loss in dynamic stiffness, caused by prestrain, is shown to be recoverable through application of a suitable heat cycle...|$|R

30|$|We {{reiterate}} {{the point}} made by Ingrin et al. (2013), who emphasised that water incorporation into olivine cannot be {{described by a}} single solubility law. The existence of the four main solubility mechanisms with their different controlling stoichiometries mandates {{that the relationship between}} C_H_ 2 O and the intensive thermodynamic variables of temperature, pressure, fH 2 O and compositional variables requires four separate terms, one for each mechanism. Quantifying water substitution in olivine must also allow for the availability of Ti and the trivalent cations, particularly Fe 3 +, whose concentration is sensitive to fO 2. Varying a_SiO__ 2 also affects substitution mechanisms in different ways. Obviously, increasing a_SiO__ 2 increases Mg vacancies but decreases Si vacancies and vice versa, but increasing a_SiO_ 2 should also promote the [triv] substitution but decrease [Ti] (Eqs.  3 and 4). The values of a_SiO_ 2 as buffered at low or high values by magnesiowüstite or pyroxene, respectively, also both change with P and T. The effect of the major element <b>compositional</b> <b>variable</b> Mg/Fe 2 + on each mechanism also requires systematic study.|$|E
40|$|We {{calculated}} temperature, {{pressure and}} compositional sensitivities of seismic velocities {{in the lower}} mantle using latest mineral physics data. The <b>compositional</b> <b>variable</b> refers to the volume proportion of perovskite in a simplified perovskite– magnesiowüstite mantle assemblage. The novelty of our approach is the exploration of a reasonable range of input parameters which enter the lower mantle extrapolations. This leads to realistic error bars on the sensitivities. Temperature variations can be inferred throughout the lower mantle within a good degree of precision. Contrary to the uppermost mantle, modest compositional changes in the lower mantle can be detected by seismic tomography, with a larger uncertainty though. A likely trade-off between temperature and composition will be largely determined by uncertainties in tomography itself. Given current sources of uncertainties on recent data, anelastic contributions to the temperature sensitivities (calculated using Karato’s approach) appear less significant than previously thought. Recent seismological determinations of the ratio of relative S to P velocity heterogeneity can be entirely explain by thermal effects, although isolated spots beneath Africa and the Central Pacific in the lowermost mantle may ask for a compositional origin. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

This iron vacancy concentration is revealed as the only significant <b>compositional</b> <b>variable</b> and as the key parameter controlling the crystal structure and the electronic properties. Single crystal X-ray diffraction, neutron powder diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements are used to demonstrate that superconductivity at temperatures as high as 40 K is observed in the hydrothermally synthesised samples when the iron vacancy concentration is low (y < 0. 05) and when the iron oxidation state is reduced slightly below + 2, while samples with a higher vacancy concentration and a correspondingly higher iron oxidation state are not superconducting. The importance of combining a low iron oxidation state with a low vacancy concentration in the iron selenide layers is emphasised by the demonstration that reductive post-synthetic lithiation of the samples turns on superconductivity with critical temperatures exceeding 40 K by displacing iron atoms from the Li 1 -xFex(OH) reservoir layer to fill vacancies in the selenide layerComment: 7 pages supplementary material available from Journal, Inorganic Chemistry 201...|$|E

It investigates whether unemployment and socioeconomic characteristics of the neighborhoods in which people live are associated with poor self-rated health after adjustment for individual sociodemographic characteristics, behavioral risk factors and health status. Moreover, it tests whether living in an area of socioeconomic deprivation modifies the association between unemployment and self-rated health. The study involved participants whose ages ranged from 15 up to 64 years, and who lived in four Brazilian cities included in the National Household Survey on Risk Behaviors and Reported Morbidity from Non-Communicable Diseases, carried out by the Ministry of Health in 2002 / 2003. Data from the 2000 Brazilian Population Census were used to calculate two neighborhood socioeconomic indicators: the proportion of householders with low income, a <b>compositional</b> <b>variable</b> of individual level characteristics, and residing in slums, a contextual variable not captured by individual properties. Logistic regression analysis was estimated by Generalized Estimating Equations. Of the 6426 participants, 20. 6 % reported poor self-rated health. Unemployment as well as residing in slums or in low income household areas were significantly associated with poor self-rated health. The magnitudes of these associations were attenuated after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, behavioral risk factors and other health status indicators. However, the association between unemployment and poor self-rated health was not modified by neighborhood socioeconomic indicators. Results confirm the association between unemployment and poor self-rated health, regardless of the personal or contextual characteristics studied here. Similarly, they show a clear independent association between self-rated health and neighborhood context. Even so, they do not show that the neighborhood contexts investigated modify the associations between unemployment and poor self-rated health.

It also presents the results of a survey channeled to Australian grapegrowers and Australian and New Zealand winemakers about their experience using BSA, their perceptions on its use and their suggestions for improving the methodology. It was evident from the survey that 90 % of grapegrowers and winemakers use BSA and they want to understand the link between BSA and wine quality. These results demonstrated the importance of BSA for wine producers and the need for further improvement. The aim of study number two was to determine if berry sensory attributes and berry <b>compositional</b> <b>variables</b> could predict wine sensory attributes, wine <b>compositional</b> <b>variables</b> and wine quality in Shiraz. The analyses of berry and wine sensory attributes, compositional measures and wine quality using partial least squares regression and Pearson’s correlations from two seasons identified several relationships between berry sensory attributes and wine sensory attributes and quality. A significant negative relationship was identified between seed bitterness and wine savoury spice flavour for the two seasons. The berry sensory attribute pulp detachment from the skin was identified as a predictor of various wine sensory attributes (eg. the harder to detach skin from the pulp the higher intensity for wine body colour, rim colour and dark berry aroma) and wine quality scores in the season 2011. The aim of study number three was to determine if berries stored at - 20 °C for three months could be used instead of fresh berries to conduct BSA. Being able to conduct BSA on frozen berries could help to reduce sensory fatigue in assessors by allowing them to evaluate samples over a longer time period and to schedule BSA away from the busy harvest period. The results of this study determined that sensory profile from Shiraz berries differed in five sensory attributes – pulp sweetness, pulp fresh fig flavour, skin colour extraction, skin bitterness and seed astringency - between fresh and frozen berries at three times of harvest, preventing the evaluation of these five sensory attributes in Shiraz frozen berries. Study number four aimed to determine the effect of three rootstocks on sensory and compositional differences of Shiraz grapes and wines in comparison to a nongrafted control. The trial was conducted over two seasons. Berry and wine sensory and compositional {{differences were found between the}} grafted treatments and the nongrafted control. PCA was able to discriminate the wines from the four treatments in three groups of aroma compounds (acetate esters, ethyl esters and higher alcohols) in both seasons. The results of wine quality scores from two seasons showed that the un-grafted treatment had the lowest quality and 110 Richter and Schwarzmann the highest. The findings from this study identified relationships between the sensory and <b>compositional</b> <b>variables</b> in berries and wines that are affecting wine quality. It also showed that that the use of rootstocks has an impact on berry and wine sensory and compositional characteristics. Thesis (Ph. D.)
