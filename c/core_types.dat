40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems in high-frequency transformers is leakage flux which is inevitable and can lead to increase the leakage inductance. The leakage inductance has different effects on pulse transformers `operation which among them the effect on rise time can be mentioned that can change the output waveform. Although inductance value can not be zero, it can be reduced to some extent. One of the ways is to choose the <b>core</b> <b>type.</b> According to <b>core</b> <b>type,</b> windings in transformer can be winded in a way that results in leakage inductance reduction. In this paper, two kinds of transformers with two different cores are modeled and simulated in ANSYS which are equal in transforming power and different in windings area.

40|$|A {{commercial}} flagship superscalar core is {{a highly}} tuned machine. Designers spend significant effort to tune the register-transfer-level (RTL) model, circuits, and layout to optimize performance and power. Nonetheless, the one-size-fits-all microar-chitecture still suffers from suboptimal performance and power on individual applications. A single-ISA heterogeneous multi-core, with its multiple diverse core designs, has potential to exploit application diversity. However, tuning multiple <b>core</b> <b>types</b> will incur insurmountable design effort. This paper proposes {{a new class of}} single-ISA heterogeneous multi-core processor, called design-effort alloy (DEA). Only one of the <b>core</b> <b>types,</b> called the high-effort core (HEC), is tuned using a high-effort design flow. Much less effort is spent on tuning other <b>core</b> <b>types,</b> called low-effort cores (LECs). We begin with synthesizable RTL designs of a palette of out-of-order superscalar <b>core</b> <b>types.</b> A LEC and HEC is designed for each core type: the LEC is based on design automation and the HEC is derived from its LEC counterpart, using frequency and energy scaling factors that account for RTL, circuit, and layout optimizations. The resulting HECs have more than a 2 x frequency advantage with only a 1. 3 x increase in energy consumption compared to their corresponding LECs. From the palette of <b>core</b> <b>types,</b> we find the best 4 -core-type DEA processor for 179 SPEC SimPoints (program phases). Our study yielded the following key results: 1) The DEA processor’s HEC is the same core type in the best high-effort homogeneous multi-core, owing to most program phases demonstrating “average ” instruction-level behavior and favoring this balanced core. 2) The DEA processor yields a speedup in BIPS 3 /W of 1 %- 87 %, and a geometric-mean speedup of 25 %, on 20 out of 179 SimPoints over the best high-effort homogeneous multi-core. Thus, untuned LECs operating at less than half the frequency of the HEC nonetheless accelerate program phases with “outlier ” instruction-level behav-ior. I...|$|E
