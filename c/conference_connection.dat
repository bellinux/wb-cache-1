Besides technical means required for editing a given document by several users simultaneously, {{there is also a}} demand for communication mechanisms which are able to support the synchronization of the users. The system presented in this paper does not only offer multi-user multimedia editing capabilities but also provides a shared workspace and an environment for communication both via terminals and via telephone. The shared workspace is a concept which allows the members of a conference to share documents and other data. Telephone communications enable members of a collaborative editing session to have <b>conference</b> <b>connections</b> and to dynamically form subgroups.

40|$|We first {{propose a}} new cell loss {{scheduling}} scheme, {{referred to as}} the QoS-scheme. This scheme can satisfy different individual quality of service (QoS) requirements of a group of virtual channel connections with minimum required bandwidth. We next derive a simple formula based on Gaussian approximation to allocate bandwidth to heterogeneous VBR video <b>conferencing</b> <b>connections.</b> Comparing the proposed QoS-scheme with the simple last-in-first-out (LIFO) scheme, we find that if the LIFO scheme is adopted as the loss scheduling scheme, developing any more efficient bandwidth allocation algorithms can at most improve bandwidth utilization by about 10 %. However, if the proposed QoS-scheme is implemented, an efficient allocation algorithm can improve bandwidth utilization by roughly 20 %. I.

40|$|The {{growing number}} of Internet users require more and more {{bandwidth}} ecient technology for accessing the World Wide Web, establishing video <b>conference</b> <b>connections,</b> using conventional telephony services or controlling the household machines from far away. To reduce the enormous costs, attached to laying down wide band optical ber to every user's door, providers are looking for reasonable, so-called "last mile" solutions, such as wireless technologies like WLAN or mobile ad-hoc networks. However, all this denotes even huge expenditures, so it is worthy employing a media that is already accessible at every electric machine used in a home, the electrical wiring. Power line {{seems to be a}} faithful medium for bridging the last mile and what's more, for creating Local Area Networks without laying down coaxial cables. The goal is to have the chance for each computer to access the Internet without installing new cables. The only problem is that this wiring was not designed for data transmission, just for supplying electric power. Our task is to make this media capable for transmitting high data rates...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Death {{of animals}} {{is a normal}} {{occurrence}} on farms and proper management of mortalities {{has important implications for}} nutrient management, herd health, public and environmental health. Catastrophic mortalities from natural or man-made disasters can have even greater implications. It is imperative that best management practices for proper disposal or processing of mortalities be understood and used. Through educational programs, networking, training and <b>conferences,</b> <b>connections</b> were made and best management practices were conveyed to farmers, butchers, students, agriculture educators and extension agents, as well as agricultural and health-related agencies. In 14 events over the past year, more than 550 agricultural and environmental consultants, regulatory personnel, educators, farmers and butchers received training and outreach materials to put into practice or pass along to their constituents. Additional assistance and information was disseminated to over 200 people through one-on-one meetings, phone and e-mail responses. Due to the programs CWMI has convened over the last year, livestock producers and agricultural regulators across the United States are adopting “better” best management practices for disposal and processing of mortalities and encouraging more to do the same. In doing so, infectious and contagious diseases are prevented and air, water and soil quality are protected. Smith-Leve...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A PC-based {{orthopedic}} rehabilitation {{system was}} de-veloped for use at home, while allowing remote monitoring from the clinic. The home rehabilitation station has a Pentium II PC with graphics accelerator, a Polhemus tracker, and a multipurpose haptic control interface. This novel interface {{is used to}} sample a pa-tient’s hand positions and to provide resistive forces using the Rut-gers Master II (RMII) glove. A library of virtual rehabilitation rou-tines was developed using WorldToolKit software. At the present time, it consists of three physical therapy exercises (DigiKey, ball, and power putty) and two functional rehabilitation exercises (peg board and ball game). These virtual reality exercises allow auto-matic and transparent patient data collection into an Oracle data-base. A remote Pentium II PC is connected with the home-based PC over the Internet and an additional video <b>conferencing</b> <b>connection.</b> The remote computer is running an Oracle server to maintain the patient database, monitor progress, and change the exercise level of difficulty. This allows for patient progress monitoring and re-peat evaluations over time. The telerehabilitation system is in clin-ical trails at Stanford Medical School (CA), with progress being monitored from Rutgers University (NJ). Other haptic interfaces currently under development include devices for elbow and knee rehabilitation connected to the same system.
