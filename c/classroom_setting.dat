Applicants for kindergarten through eighth group must submit IQ test results {{at or above the}} 91stpercentile (over 120 on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) or Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)), with consistent subtest scores, to qualify for consideration. Evaluations are based on report cards, parent questionnaires, teacher recommendations, and in-person assessments by the faculty. Early childhood through kindergarten applicants are screened in one-hour play sessions. Applicants for groups one and two are invited for a half-day school visit, and older applicants for an entire day, where they are assessed by teachers in the actual <b>classroom</b> <b>setting.</b>|$|E
5|$|Malawi {{has adopted}} task {{shifting}} strategies {{to overcome the}} shortage of workers available for HIV/AIDS treatment and care. Task shifting, which {{has been successful in}} many other regions, involves training less specialized health workers to perform health-related tasks that do not require professional training, such as the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. For example, at Thyolo District Hospital, health workers spend one week learning how to initiate antiretroviral therapy in a <b>classroom</b> <b>setting</b> and an additional two weeks practicing their knowledge in a supervised clinical setting; after completing this course, they are legally (under Ministry of Health guidelines) allowed to initiate antiretroviral therapy. Another form of task shifting involves training health-oriented counselors in HIV testing and counseling, which relieves nurses of this additional task.|$|E

25|$|Children with Down {{syndrome}} {{have increased}} difficulty forming friendships. They experience a language delay {{causing them to}} have a harder time playing with other children. Most children with Down syndrome may prefer to watch other students and play alongside a friend but not with them, mostly because they understand more than they can outwardly express. In preschool years, children with Down syndrome can benefit from the <b>classroom</b> <b>setting,</b> surrounded by other children and less dependent on adult aid. Children with this disability benefit from a variety of interactions with both adults and children. At school, ensuring an inclusive environment in the classroom can be difficult, but proximity to close friends can be crucial for social development.|$|E
25|$|Technology is {{essential}} to the field of educational psychology, not only for the psychologist themselves as far as testing, organization, and resources, but also for students. Educational Psychologists whom reside in the K- 12 setting focus the majority of their time with Special Education students. It has been found that students with disabilities learning through technology such as IPad applications and videos are more engaged and motivated to learn in the <b>classroom</b> <b>setting.</b> Liu et al. explain that learning-based technology allows for students to be more focused, and learning is more efficient with learning technologies. The authors explain that learning technology also allows for students with social- emotional disabilities to participate in distance learning.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the history}} of Western art, drawing the human figure from living models was {{considered}} {{the most effective way}} to develop the skill of draftsmanship. First, it is best to draw from life, rather than copying two dimensional images such as photographs. Second, an artist has a connection to drawing another human being that cannot exist with any other subject. Models for life drawing classes are usually nude. In the <b>classroom</b> <b>setting,</b> where the purpose is to learn how to draw the human form in all the different shapes, ages and ethnicity, there are no real limitations on who the model can be. In some cases, the model may pose with various props, one or more other models, against real or artificial background, in natural or artificial light and so on.|$|E

25|$|As {{classroom}} technologies {{become more}} prolific, so do multimodal assignments. Students {{in the 21st century}} have more options for communicating digitally, be it texting, blogging, or through social media. This rise in computer-controlled communication has required classes to become multimodal {{in order to}} teach students the skills required in the 21st-century work environment. However, in the <b>classroom</b> <b>setting,</b> multimodality is more than just combining multiple technologies, but rather creating meaning through the integration of multiple modes. Students are learning through a combination of these modes, including sound, gestures, speech, images and text. For example, in digital components of lessons, there are often pictures, videos, and sound bites as well as the text to help students grasp {{a better understanding of the}} subject. Multimodality also requires that teachers move beyond teaching with just text, as the printed word is only one of many modes students must learn and use.|$|E
25|$|The Senior Project is {{a program}} that began at Uni in the Spring of 2014. The project was {{developed}} by Assistant Director of Student Life Karl Radnitzer, who got the idea from a similar program at New Trier High School in Winnetka, IL. The project's goal is to allow second semester seniors to explore interests in a more career-oriented way than they would in a typical <b>classroom</b> <b>setting.</b> The project connects students with mentors in the Champaign-Urbana community who can help them explore their academic interests outside of the school building. Students come up with ideas for projects and submit them for approval to a Senior Project committee. If a project is approved, students then spend their second semester doing work for their project around three times a week. Students have worked in various labs at the University of Illinois, at the Crisis Nursery, at Carle Hospital, and at Krannert Center for the Performing Arts.|$|E
25|$|Improving the {{surrounding}} {{home and school}} environment can improve the behavior of children with ADHD. Parents of children with ADHD often show similar deficits themselves, and thus {{may not be able}} to sufficiently help the child with his or her difficulties. Improving the parents' understanding of the child's behavior and teaching them strategies to improve functioning and communication and discourage unwanted behavior has measurable effect on the children with ADHD. The different educational interventions for the parents are jointly called Parent Management Training. Techniques include operant conditioning: a consistent application of rewards for meeting goals and good behavior (positive reinforcement) and punishments such as time-outs or revocation of privileges for failing to meet goals or poor behavior. Classroom management is similar to parent management training; educators learn about ADHD and techniques to improve behavior applied to a <b>classroom</b> <b>setting.</b> Strategies utilized include increased structuring of classroom activities, daily feedback, and token economy.|$|E

25|$|Anger {{management}} programs with a cognitive-behavioral basis have been modified {{for children and}} adolescents. There are three common types of CBT aimed at the youth. First, life skills development (communication, empathy, assertiveness, etc.) uses modeling to teach appropriate reactions to anger. Second, effective education focuses on identifying the feelings of anger and relaxation. Finally, problem solving conveys a view {{of cause and effect}} for situations as an alternative to anger. A wide range of methods can be used to convey these three components, with both age and severity being important factors. For younger children, involvement can be increased by presenting anger management in more of a fun format with educational games and activities being available. For adolescents, group therapy can be an effective form given the resemblance to the individual's natural social environment. The severity of expressed anger issues often relates to the intensity of the subsequent anger management program. A few violent outbursts in a <b>classroom</b> <b>setting</b> could result in several sessions with the school's counselor. However, more severe juvenile delinquency could result in court mandated anger management sessions in a juvenile correctional facility.|$|E
25|$|Oftentimes, schools simply {{lack the}} {{resources}} to create an optimal <b>classroom</b> <b>setting</b> for those in need of special education. In the United States, it can cost between $6595 to $10,421 extra to educate a child with autism. In the 2011-2012 school year, {{the average cost of}} education for a public school student was $12,401. In some cases, the extra cost required to educate a child with autism nearly doubles the average cost to educate the average public school student. As the range of those with autism can widely vary, {{it is very difficult to}} create an autism program that is well suited to the entire population of autistics as well as those with other disabilities. In the United States, many school districts are requiring schools to meet the needs of disabled students, regardless of the number of children with disabilities there are in the school. This combined with a shortage of licensed special education teachers has created a deficiency in the special education system. The shortage has caused some states to give temporary special education licenses to teachers with the caveat that they receive a license within a few years.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the use of graphing calculators over a one year time frame with students enrolled in Algebra I courses. Researchers sought to answer questions regarding the relationships among the use of graphing calculators on standardized assessments and student achievement, levels of access, and classroom use of graphing calculators. The researchers recruited {{participation in the study}} by high schools in two states. Students took two tests without using a graphing calculator then took a third test using a graphing calculator. Researchers examined data with a Repeated Measures General Linear Model (GLM), Multiple Regression, and Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) to investigate differences and relationships between mathematics achievement, graphing calculators, and student and teacher variables. Researchers found that students demonstrated higher levels of math performance when a graphing calculator was used. There was a positive correlation between the residual gain scores and students using a <b>classroom</b> <b>set</b> of graphing calculators. Using HLM, researchers constructed a model where 12 % of math achievement variability was statistically explained by: (1) student use of a graphing calculator; (2) student ownership of a graphing calculator; (3) student access and use of a <b>classroom</b> <b>set</b> of graphing calculator; (4) student familiarity in graphing more that one function; (5) teacher familiarity in writing a program using the graphing calculator; and (6) connecting graphing calculators to motion detectors, computers, or other graphing calculators...|$|R
