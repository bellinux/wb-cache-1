50|$|<b>Category</b> <b>management</b> is an {{approach}} to the organisation of purchasing within a business organisation. Applying <b>category</b> <b>management</b> to purchasing activity benefits organisations by providing {{an approach}} {{to reduce the cost}} of buying goods and services, reduce risk in the supply chain, increase overall value from the supply base and gain access to more innovation from suppliers. It is a strategic approach which focuses on the vast majority of organisational spend. If applied effectively throughout an entire organisation, the results can be significantly greater than traditional transactional based purchasing negotiations, however the discipline of <b>category</b> <b>management</b> is sorely misunderstood.|$|E

The basis of <b>category</b> <b>management,</b> according to Harris models, is to: force consumer focus during retail decisions; create strategy for differentiation and competition; provide a model for collaboration; promote information sharing for the sake of better decision-making; provide strategic logic when developing tactical decisions; clarify decisions when it comes to asset allocation; and clarify employee responsibilities.|$|E

5000|$|For MRP-based {{manufacturing}} industries, {{the predominant}} cost-saving methodology in <b>category</b> <b>management</b> (CM) involves {{the integration of}} market intelligence with leveraged spending (for a given category of product or service). In industries where asset operation and preservation bear more significance to the procurement process than do product manufacturing - such as in an MRO environment - demonstrable benefit can still be achieved with <b>category</b> <b>management</b> but is best approached with some manner of adjustment to CM’s usual processes for analysis and strategy development. The first challenge becomes incorporating analytical processes and value drivers that are largely indigenous to the MRP world {{in a manner that}} makes sense to an MRO environment. The second (and no less important) challenge becomes avoiding a trap where the CM processes are perceived to be more important than their outcome - a scenario that can result in significant analytical delay, and even complete process paralysis. An excellent example of an MRO environment warranting adjustment to classical <b>category</b> <b>management</b> is nuclear power generation in the United States, where the adjusted approach to <b>category</b> <b>management</b> has been coined [...] "MCM" [...] - standing for MRO-based <b>Category</b> <b>Management</b> or Modified <b>Category</b> <b>Management.</b> Not only does electricity generation epitomize an MRO-driven environment, the nuclear energy source adds numerous dimensions of supply and procurement complexity - including federal and state regulatory compliance, nuclear industry standards compliance, nuclear-unique system and component design, and a tightly-audited (and very small) supply base, amongst others. Due to the nature and quantity of discrete characteristics native to nuclear power generation, it can easily be argued that nuclear power generation, in and of itself, should be a distinct category of procurement within a <b>category</b> <b>management</b> project. The fundamental adjustment made between the classical <b>category</b> <b>management</b> approach and the nuclear MCM approach is a shift from procurement strategies focused on leveraged spending to procurement strategies embracing nuclear value drivers, technology innovation, risk management, and strategic sourcing.|$|E
