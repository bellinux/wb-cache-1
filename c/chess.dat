5|$|Bughouse <b>chess</b> (also {{known as}} Exchange <b>chess,</b> Siamese <b>chess,</b> Tandem <b>chess,</b> Transfer <b>chess,</b> Double bughouse, Cross <b>chess,</b> Swap <b>chess</b> or simply bughouse or bug) {{is a popular}} <b>chess</b> variant played on two chessboards by four players in teams of two.|$|E
5|$|There were {{multiple}} side {{events that}} took place in order to promote the <b>Chess</b> Olympiad and the game of <b>chess</b> such as the operation of <b>chess</b> buses, 3D street art on <b>chess</b> topics, display of painted <b>chess</b> pieces, <b>Chess</b> Queen street performances, <b>chess</b> photography exhibitions, and parallel <b>chess</b> tournaments.|$|E
5|$|As the 19th century progressed, <b>chess</b> {{organization}} developed quickly. Many <b>chess</b> clubs, <b>chess</b> books, and <b>chess</b> journals appeared. There were correspondence matches between cities; for example, the London <b>Chess</b> Club {{played against}} the Edinburgh <b>Chess</b> Club in 1824. <b>Chess</b> problems became {{a regular part of}} 19th-century newspapers; Bernhard Horwitz, Josef Kling, and Samuel Loyd composed {{some of the}} most influential problems. In 1843, von der Lasa published his and Bilguer's Handbuch des Schachspiels (Handbook of <b>Chess),</b> the first comprehensive manual of <b>chess</b> theory.|$|E
5|$|Benet's <b>chess</b> team, {{founded in}} 2012, has won every Far Side Suburban <b>Chess</b> Conference {{champion}} ship since the team's inception. In 2014 the <b>chess</b> team took 2nd {{place at the}} IHSA state tournament.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chess</b> {{composition}} {{is a distinct}} branch of <b>chess</b> sport, and tournaments exist for both the composition and solving of <b>chess</b> problems.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary <b>chess</b> is an {{organized}} sport with structured international and national leagues, tournaments, and congresses. Chess's international governing body is FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs). Most countries {{have a national}} <b>chess</b> organization as well (such as the US <b>Chess</b> Federation and English <b>Chess</b> Federation) {{which in turn is}} a member of FIDE. FIDE {{is a member of the}} International Olympic Committee, but the game of <b>chess</b> has never been part of the Olympic Games; <b>chess</b> does have its own Olympiad, held every two years as a team event.|$|E
5|$|Fischer heavily disparaged <b>chess</b> {{as it was}} {{currently}} being played (at the highest levels). As a result, on June 19, 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Fischer announced and advocated a variant of <b>chess</b> called Fischerandom <b>Chess</b> (later known as Chess960). The goal of Fischerandom <b>Chess</b> was {{to ensure that a}} game between two players is a contest between their understandings of <b>chess,</b> rather than their abilities to memorize opening lines or prepare opening strategies.|$|E
5|$|From May to December 1840 Staunton edited a <b>chess</b> {{column for}} the New Court Gazette. He then became <b>chess</b> editor of the {{magazine}} British Miscellany, and his <b>chess</b> column developed into a separate magazine, the <b>Chess</b> Player's Chronicle, which Staunton owned and edited until the early 1850s.|$|E
5|$|German {{grandmaster}} Karsten Müller wrote:Fischer, who {{had taken}} the highest crown almost singlehandedly from the mighty, almost invincible Soviet <b>chess</b> empire, shook the whole world, not only the <b>chess</b> world, to its core. He started a <b>chess</b> boom {{not only in the}} United States and in the Western hemisphere, but worldwide. Teaching <b>chess</b> or playing <b>chess</b> as a career had truly become a respectable profession. After Bobby, the game was simply not the same.|$|E
5|$|Gossip {{also wrote}} the lesser-known <b>chess</b> books The <b>Chess</b> Players' Text Book (1889), The Chess-player's Vade Mecum and Pocket Guide to the Openings (1891), Modern <b>Chess</b> Brilliancies (1892), The <b>Chess</b> Player's Pocket Guide to Games at Odds (1893), The <b>Chess</b> Pocket Manual (1894), The <b>Chess</b> Player's Mentor (with Francis Joseph Lee, 1895), The Complete Chess-Guide (with Lee, 1903), Gossip's Vest-Pocket <b>Chess</b> Manual (date unknown; pictured at above left), and a {{collection}} of his own games, Games: G. H. D. Gossip versus Bezkrowny, Clerc, Donisthorpe, Gocher, Gunsberg, Hoffer, Owen, Sanders, Vines Played During the Last 10 Years in England & France (1882, with Gunsberg and Steinitz).|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Nigel Short {{wrote in}} The Sunday Telegraph <b>chess</b> column that he {{believed}} he had been secretly playing Fischer on the Internet <b>Chess</b> Club (ICC) in speed <b>chess</b> matches. Fischer denied ownership of the account.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of <b>chess</b> variants, regular (i.e. FIDE) <b>chess</b> is {{sometimes}} referred to as Western <b>chess,</b> international <b>chess,</b> orthodox <b>chess,</b> and orthochess.|$|E
5|$|International {{titles are}} awarded to composers and solvers of <b>chess</b> {{problems}} and to correspondence <b>chess</b> players (by the International Correspondence <b>Chess</b> Federation). National <b>chess</b> organizations may also award titles, usually to the advanced players {{still under the}} level needed for international titles; {{an example is the}} <b>Chess</b> expert title used in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Nadanian {{has contributed}} {{analysis}} to many <b>chess</b> publications {{throughout the world}} including the <b>Chess</b> Informant, New In <b>Chess</b> Yearbook, 64, Kaissiber and Szachy <b>Chess.</b> He {{is a columnist for}} the Chessville.com website and has also written for ChessBase and the Armenian <b>Chess</b> Academy website.|$|E

5|$|The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) {{held the}} first major <b>chess</b> tournament for computers, the North American Computer <b>Chess</b> Championship, in September 1970. <b>CHESS</b> 3.0, a <b>chess</b> program from Northwestern University, won the championship. Nowadays, <b>chess</b> {{programs}} compete in the World Computer <b>Chess</b> Championship, held annually since 1974. At first considered only a curiosity, the best <b>chess</b> playing programs have become extremely strong. In 1997, a computer won a <b>chess</b> match using classical time controls against a reigning World Champion for the first time: IBM's Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov 3½–2½ (it scored two wins, one loss, and three draws). In 2009, a mobile phone won a category 6 tournament with a performance rating 2898: <b>chess</b> engine Hiarcs 13 running on the mobile phone HTC Touch HD won the Copa Mercosur tournament with nine wins and one draw. The best <b>chess</b> programs {{are now able to}} consistently beat the strongest human players, to the extent that human-computer matches no longer attract interest from <b>chess</b> players or media.|$|E
5|$|The oldest archaeological artifacts, ivory <b>chess</b> pieces, were {{excavated}} {{in ancient}} Afrasiab, today's Samarkand, in Uzbekistan, central Asia, and date to about 760, {{with some of}} them possibly older. The oldest known <b>chess</b> manual was in Arabic and dates to 840–850, written by al-Adli ar-Rumi (800–870), a renowned Arab <b>chess</b> player, titled Kitab ash-shatranj (Book of the <b>chess).</b> This is a lost manuscript, but referenced in later works. The eastern migration of <b>chess,</b> into China and Southeast Asia, has even less documentation than its migration west. The first reference to <b>chess,</b> called Xiang Qi, in China comes in the xuán guaì lù (玄怪录, record of the mysterious and strange) dating to about 800. Alternatively, some contend that <b>chess</b> arose from Chinese <b>chess</b> or one of its predecessors, although this has been contested.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} <b>chess</b> (also {{known as the}} laws of <b>chess)</b> are rules {{governing}} the {{play of the game}} of <b>chess.</b> While the exact origins of <b>chess</b> are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules continued to be slightly modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form. The rules also varied somewhat from place to place. Today, the standard rules are set by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), the international governing body for <b>chess.</b> Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes. There are variations of the rules for fast <b>chess,</b> correspondence <b>chess,</b> online <b>chess,</b> and Chess960.|$|E
5|$|Veselin Topalov became FIDE World <b>Chess</b> Champion {{by winning}} the FIDE World <b>Chess</b> Championship 2005. He lost his title in the World <b>Chess</b> Championship 2006 against Vladimir Kramnik.|$|E
5|$|With these {{or similar}} views, <b>chess</b> is taught to {{children}} in schools around the world today. Many schools host <b>chess</b> clubs, {{and there are many}} scholastic tournaments specifically for children. Tournaments are held regularly in many countries, hosted by organizations such as the United States <b>Chess</b> Federation and the National Scholastic <b>Chess</b> Foundation.|$|E
5|$|A 2007 {{study of}} young <b>chess</b> {{players in the}} United Kingdom found that strong players tended to have above-average IQ scores, but, within that group, the {{correlation}} between <b>chess</b> skill and IQ was moderately negative, meaning that smarter children tended to achieve {{a lower level of}} <b>chess</b> skill. This result was explained by a negative correlation between intelligence and practice in the elite subsample, and by practice having a higher influence on <b>chess</b> skill.|$|E
5|$|A keen amateur <b>chess</b> player, Moore {{carried a}} pocket set and was vice {{president}} of Sussex Junior <b>Chess</b> Association. In 2003, he presented Sussex Junior David Howell with the best young <b>chess</b> player award on Carlton Television's Britain's Brilliant Prodigies show. Moore had represented Sussex in his youth.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the link}} between {{performance}} in <b>chess</b> and general intelligence is often assumed, researchers have largely failed to confirm its existence. For example, a 2006 study found no differences in fluid intelligence, as measured by Raven's Progressive Matrices, between strong adult <b>chess</b> players and regular people. There is some evidence towards a correlation between performance in <b>chess</b> and intelligence among beginning players. However, performance in <b>chess</b> also relies substantially on one's experience playing the game, {{and the role of}} experience may overwhelm the role of intelligence. <b>Chess</b> experts are estimated to have in excess of 10,000 and possibly as many as 300,000 position patterns stored in their memory; long training is necessary to acquire that amount of data.|$|E
5|$|An {{artificial}} intelligence approach, designed by Jean-Marc Alliot of the Institut de recherche en informatique de Toulouse ("Toulouse Computer Science Research Institute"), which compares <b>chess</b> grandmaster moves against that of Stockfish—a <b>chess</b> engine which outperforms all human opponents—rated Carlsen {{as the best}} player of all time as he had the highest probability of all World <b>Chess</b> Champions to play the moves which Stockfish suggested.|$|E
5|$|Anderssen's {{only known}} {{competitive}} <b>chess</b> between 1862 and 1866 was a drawn match (three wins, three losses, and two draws) in 1864 against Berthold Suhle, {{who was a}} strong player and respected <b>chess</b> writer.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his play and {{writings}} Steinitz, along with Paul Morphy, is considered by many <b>chess</b> commentators to be the founder of modern <b>chess.</b>|$|E
5|$|Born in Hendon, London, Philip Stuart was {{the second}} of six {{children}} to a schoolteacher, Edward Leopold Milner-Barry, who died in 1917, and his wife, Edith Mary. A talented <b>chess</b> player, he won the first British Boys' Championship in 1923. He was a pupil at Cheltenham College, and won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained firsts in classics and moral sciences. He represented Cambridge in <b>chess.</b> At Cambridge, he befriended another <b>chess</b> player, C.H.O'D. (Hugh) Alexander, and composed a number of <b>chess</b> puzzles. Between 1929 and 1938 he was a city stockbroker, although he was unhappy with the work. From 1938, he was the <b>chess</b> correspondent for The Times, succeeded in 1945 by Harry Golombek.|$|E
5|$|Born in Zittau, Bindrich {{became a}} FIDE Master {{at the age}} of 13. He earned his International Master title in 2006 and his {{grandmaster}} title a year later. He played in the 2008 <b>Chess</b> Olympiad, held in Dresden, where his German team placed 13th. He has competed in several other prestigious <b>chess</b> events, such as the 2008 Bundesliga and the 2010 <b>Chess</b> Olympiad.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chess</b> playing {{programs}} HiTech and Deep Thought defeated <b>chess</b> {{masters in}} 1989. Both {{were developed by}} Carnegie Mellon University; Deep Thought development {{paved the way for}} the Deep Blue.|$|E
5|$|Deeper {{insight into}} the nature of <b>chess</b> came with two younger players. American Paul Morphy, an {{extraordinary}} <b>chess</b> prodigy, won against all important competitors (except Howard Staunton, who refused to play), including Anderssen, during his short <b>chess</b> career between 1857 and 1863. Morphy's success stemmed from a combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy; he intuitively knew how to prepare attacks.|$|E
5|$|Different notations for piece drops are possible. The {{internet}} <b>chess</b> servers FICS and Internet <b>Chess</b> Club use the at-sign @, as in N@f1 (knight drop at f1), Q@e6+ (queen drop with check at e6) or P@h7 (pawn drop at h7).|$|E
5|$|Fischer {{claimed that}} {{standard}} <b>chess</b> was stale {{and that he}} now played blitz games of <b>chess</b> variants, such as Chess960. He visited with the Polgár family in Budapest and analyzed many games with Judit, Zsuzsa, and Zsófia Polgár.|$|E
5|$|He {{also plays}} {{correspondence}} <b>chess.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{represented}} England in <b>chess,</b> {{and played}} in the international <b>Chess</b> Olympiads of 1937 and 1939. The latter tournament, held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, coincided with Britain's declaration of war on Germany in September 1939. Milner-Barry, with teammates who included Hugh Alexander (at that time the British <b>chess</b> champion) and Harry Golombek, abandoned the tournament unfinished, and returned to Britain. His full Olympiad results are listed later in the article.|$|E
5|$|His {{personal}} correspondence, his own {{articles and}} some third-party articles, however, {{show that he}} had long and friendly relationships with many people and groups in the <b>chess</b> world, including Ignác Kolisch (one of his earliest sponsors), Mikhail Chigorin, Harry Nelson Pillsbury, Bernhard Horwitz, Amos Burn and the Cuban and Russian <b>chess</b> communities. He even co-operated with the American <b>Chess</b> Congress in its project to regulate future contests for the world title that he had earned.|$|E
5|$|His {{proposal}} {{was supported by}} the delegates and the FIDE Congress awarded the <b>Chess</b> Olympiad 2016 to Baku, and the <b>Chess</b> World Cup 2015 for the year before.|$|E
