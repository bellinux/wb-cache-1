40|$|Industrial robots {{are widely}} used in {{aircraft}} assembly systems such as robotic drilling systems. It is necessary to expand a robot’s working range with a moving rail. A method for improving <b>the</b> position accuracy <b>of</b> an automated assembly system with an industrial robot mounted on a moving rail is proposed. A multi-station method is used to control the robot in this study. The robot only works at stations which are certain positions defined on the moving rail. <b>The</b> <b>calibration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot system is composed by <b>the</b> <b>calibration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot and <b>the</b> <b>calibration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stations. <b>The</b> <b>calibration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot is based on error similarity and inverse distance weighted interpolation. <b>The</b> <b>calibration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stations {{is based on a}} magnetic strip and a magnetic sensor.
