5|$|As {{they had}} done on More, the band saw a rough cut of the film and noted certain timings for cues with a stopwatch. From this, they created a number of pieces that they felt could be <b>cross-faded</b> at various points in the final cut of the film. They were not worried about {{creating}} complete songs, feeling that any musical piece would be workable {{without the need for}} any solos, but nevertheless, under pressure to produce enough material, they managed to create a whole series of well-structured songs. Drummer Nick Mason recalls that the sessions were very hurried, and the band spent most of the time in Paris locked away in the studio.|$|E
500|$|On the Sgt. Pepper album, {{the start}} of [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] is <b>cross-faded</b> with the applause {{at the end of}} the {{previous}} track [...] "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)". On The Beatles 1967–1970 LP, [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] fades in through the Sgt. Pepper cross-fade, but on [...] and the CD version of 1967–1970, the song starts cleanly, without any fade or cross-fade. Also, the [...] "1967–1970" [...] CD does not have the sped up ending, and instead it just ends after the E Major chord has faded enough so nobody could hear it.|$|E
2500|$|On The Beatles album, {{the end of}} [...] "Back in the U.S.S.R" [...] is <b>cross-faded</b> {{with the}} start of the next track [...] "Dear Prudence". On The Beatles 1967–1970, [...] "Back in the U.S.S.R" [...] fades out before the cross fade of Dear Prudence starts. This is also the case on the remixed version of the song from Love.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{software}} applications that feature virtual <b>cross-fades,</b> for instance, burning-software for {{the recording of}} audio-CDs. Also many DAW’s (Pro Tools, Logic exc.) have this function. <b>Cross-fade</b> is normally found on samplers and usually based on velocity. The purpose of a <b>cross-fade</b> it to utilize a smooth changeover between two cut pieces of audio. Velocity <b>cross-fading</b> can be incorporated through a MIDI transformation device and where more than one note can be assigned to a given pad (note) on the MIDI keyboard; velocity <b>cross-fading</b> may be available.|$|R

50|$|The eight track {{tape was}} then turned over, and Campbell played against the reverse {{sound of the}} track, {{including}} his initial first four bars ensuring that he played another long “G” near the same point which could be <b>cross-faded</b> against the original - the tape was then turned over to normal setup, and he selected just 4 bars from the reverse recording which are bars 4-7 inclusive - this was <b>cross-faded</b> with the original at bar 4 - lhe then picked up from bar 8 through to bar 16 as normal, so in fact, only 4 bars are actually “reversed”.|$|E
5000|$|... "Misery Machine" [...] {{is listed}} as the album version but {{does not include the}} hidden track on Portrait of an American Family. The version on the single is <b>cross-faded</b> into [...] "Mother Inferior Got Her Gunn".|$|E
5000|$|The 1996 remaster was remixed by Jon Astley. On the remaster, {{the end of}} [...] "They Are All in Love" [...] is <b>cross-faded</b> with [...] "Blue, Red and Grey." [...] The {{original}} album did not feature this cross-fade.|$|E

50|$|These {{types of}} <b>cross-fades</b> (those {{that are based}} on note velocity) allow two (even more) samples to be {{assigned}} to one note or range of notes. This requires both a loud and soft sample; {{the reason for this is}} Timbre change. This type of <b>cross-fade</b> is quite subtle depending on the proportion of the received note velocity value of the loud and soft sample.|$|R

5000|$|The album {{produced}} two singles, [...] "Golden Boy" [...] and [...] "Cry", the latter {{which became a}} groundbreaking video clip featuring numerous [...] "changing faces" [...] that <b>cross-faded</b> {{from one to another}} as they mimed the lyrics to the song.|$|E
5000|$|Initially {{released}} on two 45rpm vinyl LPs, the album's twelve songs are segued together into four colour coded (red, green, blue, black), <b>cross-faded</b> suites. As such, {{the album was}} included in Pitchfork Media's 2010 list of [...] "ten unusual CD-era gimmicks".|$|E
5000|$|Cacophonous {{feedback}} fade-outs {{ending a}} song {{are most often}} used to generate rather than relieve tension, often <b>cross-faded</b> too after a thematic and musical release. Examples include Modwheelmood's remix of Nine Inch Nail's [...] "The Great Destroyer"; and the Jesus and Mary Chain's [...] "Teenage Lust", [...] "Tumbledown", [...] "Catchfire", [...] "Sundown", and [...] "Frequency".|$|E

5000|$|Track 8.2, the outro of {{the album}} {{at the end of}} track 8, {{consists}} of a cover of [...] "Sono L'Antechristo" [...] by Diamanda Galás, and is <b>cross-faded</b> in from [...] "Blood Libels" [...] from 6:18 on. It is unmentioned in the track listing on the release, but referred to in the credit prints.|$|E
5000|$|In live {{performances}} of the period, when it was regularly used as the opening number, the final chord of the pre-recorded [...] "walk-on" [...] music (the closing passage of Stravinsky's The Firebird) was <b>cross-faded</b> into a bridging minor-key Mellotron passage, followed by the opening guitar riff, and was usually concluded with a reprise of opening riff.|$|E
5000|$|On The Beatles album, {{the end of}} [...] "Back in the U.S.S.R" [...] is <b>cross-faded</b> {{with the}} start of the next track [...] "Dear Prudence".

5000|$|On The Beatles album, {{the song}} was sequenced as the second track on side one, its {{introduction}} <b>cross-faded</b> {{with the sounds of}} a jet aircraft landing which conclude the previous track, [...] "Back in the U.S.S.R." [...] The descending chromatic bass-line in the song {{is similar to that of}} [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds".|$|E
5000|$|Notes: The {{first two}} are {{abridged}} versions {{of those on}} the original release of The Rotters' Club. [...] "Halfway Between Heaven and Earth" [...] was first released on [...] "Over the Rainbow" [...] - a various artists live album. This version is slightly shorter, the introduction is <b>cross-faded</b> with the preceding track. The last two tracks were first released on Afters.|$|E
5000|$|On the Sgt. Pepper album, {{the start}} of [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] is <b>cross-faded</b> with the applause {{at the end of}} the {{previous}} track [...] "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)". On The Beatles 1967-1970 LP, [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] fades in through the Sgt. Pepper cross-fade, but on Imagine: John Lennon and the CD version of 1967-1970, the song starts cleanly, without any fade or cross-fade.|$|E

50|$|Unlike other albums, Born in the Echoes {{does not}} feature any segues between tracks. However, tracks 3 and 4 and 4 and 5 have subtle <b>cross-fades.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "Dear God" [...] was {{ultimately}} released as the B-side to the UK lead single [...] "Grass", {{but due to}} its popularity with American DJs, the album was reissued in the US, with [...] "Mermaid Smiled" [...] removed and [...] "Dear God" [...] <b>cross-faded</b> into the following track, [...] "Dying", giving the second edition of the US album a revised track sequence. Partridge commented: [...] "When 'Dear God' ... became a hit something {{had to go and}} so I took off the shortest song." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{beginning}} of the song is <b>cross-faded</b> over {{the end of the}} previous track on Led Zeppelin, [...] "Your Time Is Gonna Come". An overdubbed rapid guitar lick can be heard with the tempo then steadying to 114 beats per minute throughout the song. Page did this to simulate the sound of a sitar, for which the song's dropped-down D♭-A♭-D♭-G♭-A♭-D♭ tuning leads into. Page played a borrowed Gibson J-200 acoustic guitar for this recording. To enhance the Indian character of the song, drummer and sitarist Viram Jasani played tabla on the track.|$|E
50|$|After {{the success}} of More, we had agreed to do another sound track for Barbet Schroeder. His new film was called La Vallée and we {{travelled}} over to France to record the music {{in the last week}} of February... We did the recording with the same method we had employed for More, following a rough cut of the film, using stopwatches for specific cues and creating interlinking musical moods that would be <b>cross-faded</b> to suit the final version... The recording time was extremely tight. We only had two weeks to record the soundtrack with {{a short amount of time}} afterwards to turn it into an album.|$|E
50|$|The {{second type}} of S-curve is more apt for longer <b>cross-fades,</b> since they are smooth and {{have the ability to}} have both of the crossfades in the overall level; so that they are audible for as long as possible. There is a short period at the start of each of the <b>cross-fades</b> where the {{outgoing}} sound drops toward 50% quickly (with the incoming sound rising just as fast to 50%). This acceleration of sound slows and both sounds will appear as if they are at the same level for most of the <b>cross-fade</b> (in the middle) before the changeover happens. DAW’s gives one the ability to change the shape of logarithmic, exponential, and S-curve fades and <b>cross-fades.</b> Changing the shape of a logarithmic fade will change how soon the sound will rise above 50%, and then how long it takes {{for the end of the}} fade-out to drop below 50% once again. With exponential fades the shape change will affect the shape in reverse, to the shape of the logarithmic fade. In the S-curve’s traditional form the shape determines how quickly the change can occur and in the type 2 curve the change can determine the time it takes for both the sounds to get to a nearly equal level.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cross-fading</b> usually {{involves}} the sounding {{of a combination}} of one or two sounds at the same time. While <b>cross-fading</b> one does not want {{the second part of the}} fade to start playing before the first part is finished; one wants the overlapping parts to be as short as possible. If edit regions aren’t trimmed to a zero-crossing point one will get unwelcome pops in the middle. A sound at the lowest velocity can fade into a sound of a higher velocity, in the order of: first the first sound then the second. All possible without fading out the sounds that are already present. This in turn is a form of Layering that can be used in the mix. The same effect (as was created with velocity) can be applied to a controller. This allows continued monitored control; the <b>cross-fading</b> function can also be controlled on some instruments by the keyboard position. These sounds on the MIDI keyboard can be programmed.|$|R
50|$|The Korg Wavestation {{went further}} still, {{allowing}} {{each of the}} four sound sources to produce not just a static tone, but a complex wave sequence, by playing back or <b>cross-fading</b> one wave after another.|$|R
