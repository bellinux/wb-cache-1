The name comes from the use of a cloud-shaped symbol as an abstraction for the complex infrastructure it contains in system diagrams. Cloud computing entrusts remote services with a user's data, software and computation. A storage cloud provides storage services, while a compute cloud provides compute services. We describe the design of the Sector storage cloud and how it provides the storage services required by the Sphere compute cloud. A cloud can be a storage cloud that provides block or file based storage service or it can be a compute cloud that provides computational services.

Clouds associated primarily with the warm sector of the storm were sampled at various locations and altitudes. In storm midlevels at temperatures where heterogeneous freezing is expected to be significant (here &minus; 24 to &minus; 29 &deg;C), IN measurements from ice particle residues generally agreed well with simultaneous measurements of total ice concentrations provided that the measurements were made at ambient temperatures similar to those in the CFDC chamber, suggesting heterogeneous freezing as the dominant ice formation process in the mid levels of these warm <b>sector</b> <b>clouds.</b> Lower in the storm, at warmer temperatures (&minus; 22 to &minus; 6. 4 &deg;C), ice particle concentrations were similar to IN concentrations at CFDC chamber temperatures representative of colder temperatures.

A Data Center Network (DCN) constitutes the communicational backbone of a data center, ascertaining the performance boundaries for cloud infrastructure. The DCN needs to be robust to failures and uncertainties to deliver the required Quality-of-Service (QoS) level and satisfy service-level agreement (SLA). In this paper, we analyze robustness of the state-of-the-art DCNs. Our major contributions are: 1) we present multilayered graph modeling of various DCNs; 2) we study the classical robustness metrics considering various failure scenarios to perform a comparative analysis; 3) we present the inadequacy of the classical network robustness metrics to appropriately evaluate the DCN robustness; and 4) we propose new procedures to quantify the DCN robustness.

First, scientific uncertainty about aggregated ecological pressure and drivers in relation to the different <b>sectors</b> <b>clouds</b> the definition of national programmes of measures and this in turn may lead to implementation-drift in achieving GES.

Finally, the coming together of both stakeholder involvement organized for the MSFD and those of existing, sectoral policy domains makes fair and efficient stakeholder involvement challenging.

The combined CloudSat-Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) cloud profiles confirm these passive observations, but they also reveal that low-level clouds in other parts of the cyclones are also not properly represented in the reanalyses. The two reanalyses are in fairly good agreement for the dynamic and thermodynamic characteristics of the cyclones, suggesting that the cloud, convection, or boundary layer schemes are the problem instead. An examination of the lower-tropospheric stability distribution in the cyclones from both reanalyses suggests that the parameterization of shallow cumulus clouds may contribute in a large part to the problem.
