2500|$|The {{traction}} engine, in {{the form}} recognisable today, developed partly from an experiment in 1859 when Thomas Aveling modified a Clayton & Shuttleworth portable engine, {{which had to be}} hauled from job to job by horses, into a self-propelled one. [...] The alteration was made by fitting a long driving chain between the <b>crankshaft</b> and the <b>rear</b> axle.|$|R
50|$|The 2488 cc L SD25 is {{the biggest}} version of the four-cylinder SD series, with the larger bore and stroke of 89.0 and 100.0 mm. It was fitted to Nissan 720 pickup trucks 1983 through 1986 and D21 Nissan pickups (only 1986-1988. In canada and some {{european}} markets It was also fitted to the Nissan Urvan and Cabstar. Featured five main bearing <b>crankshaft</b> & redesigned <b>rear</b> main seal.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{designed}} by Edward Turner in 1928, the dry-sump Ariel Square Four {{was the only}} British motorcycle engine with four cylinders arranged to form a square. The front two cylinders powered one <b>crankshaft</b> while the <b>rear</b> two drove a second. Unlike contemporary British parallel twins, each crankshaft had a 180Â° configuration, the two crankshafts being linked by a helical gear so that diagonally opposed pistons moved in unison. The engine had even ignition intervals, and {{was said to be}} smooth, with little vibration.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s, Nissan of Japan licence-built the Austin A40 and A50 {{with their}} B-Series engines. In later years, this engine was fitted to Nissan's own designs of light trucks. The B-series engine was {{developed}} further in Japan, particularly to redesign the perennially leaking <b>rear</b> <b>crankshaft</b> seal. This improved engine {{was known as}} the 'C Series' or eponymously as the 'Stone engine' after its designer. This overlapping name has led to a persistent myth that the six cylinder C-Series engine was also licence-built in Japan; it was not.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{locomotives}} {{have been}} built with horizontal cylinders driving a crankshaft directly above the rear driving axle, with a common spring supporting both the shaft and axle {{so that they could}} move vertically together. Ross Winans designed a series of 0-8-0 locomotives starting in 1842, launching what became the B&O Mud Digger class of engines. Like the Grasshopper locomotives before them, the crank shafts on these engines were geared to the driven shafts. [...] In his 1843 patent, Winas referred to the crankshaft as a fifth shaft, or axle. [...] In 1880, the Fowler Steam Plough Works of Leeds England received a patent on a similar 0-4-0 locomotive design with vertical side rods between the <b>crankshaft</b> and <b>rear</b> axle. Here, the motivation was to get the cylinders and piston rods up away from dust and dirt on an engine with diminutive drive wheels. [...] One such Fowler locomotive survives, an very small narrow-gauge 0-4-2T.|$|R
50|$|For the 1990 model year, all Blazers {{now had a}} {{standard}} rear wheel anti-lock braking system. A new electronic speedometer system, with a 6 digit odometer on the dashboard was also introduced for 1990, along with non-asbestos brake linings. A new brake warning light on the dashboard was also introduced for 1990. The Blazer body also used double sided, galvanized exterior sheet metal. A new option for 1990 was power mirrors. The 5.7-liter V-8 (L05) engine was improved for 1990 {{with the addition of}} improved oil control rings, a redesigned <b>rear</b> <b>crankshaft</b> seal, a new camshaft sprocket design, non-asbestos intake manifold gaskets, and heavy-duty intake valves.|$|R
50|$|Where the D.II {{differed}} from the Austro-Daimler was largely in mechanical arrangement. For instance, the D.II featured a single overhead cam, powered by a shaft leading up from the <b>crankshaft</b> at the <b>rear</b> of the engine, whereas the Austro-Daimler had a more conventional valvetrain using pushrods driven from the crankcase. Another unique feature was the ability to shift the camshaft to a half-compression position for starting. The D.II used two carburetors located together {{on one side of}} the engine, feeding the cylinders through two manifolds; the Austro-Daimler separated its carburetors to locate them closer to the cylinders they fed. The D.II also used a unique cooling jacket design, with every two cylinders being covered by a single jacket.|$|R
5000|$|In {{parallel}} with the early portable engine development, many engineers attempted to make them self-propelled [...] - [...] the fore-runners of the traction engine. In most cases this was achieved by fitting a sprocket {{on the end of}} the crankshaft, and running a chain from this to a larger sprocket on the rear axle. These experiments met with mixed success. The first proper traction engine, in the form recognisable today, was developed in 1859 when British engineer Thomas Aveling modified a Clayton & Shuttleworth portable engine, which had to be hauled from job to job by horses, into a self-propelled one. The alteration was made by fitting a long driving chain between the <b>crankshaft</b> and the <b>rear</b> axle.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} a modern unit, with a {{water-cooled}} inline design with forged crankshaft, alloy cross-flow head and five main bearings. An unusual feature on early models was {{the absence of}} a spin-on paper oil filter. Instead, the engine featured a form of centrifugal oil filter in the hollow <b>rear</b> <b>crankshaft</b> pulley, although all later versions used the more traditional disposable cartridge filters. One of its major innovations was the use of a swirl vortex on the intake valve port which gave very good combustion, and thus both power and economy for this time. This engine proved cheap to build, and several models of different sizes and market segments used this displacement, which survived until 1982, as the ever-present entry level for the Simca 1100.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1890s, {{the term}} {{began to be}} used in a manner closer to the modern sense. In 1891, for example, Battles {{referred}} to the shaft between the transmission and driving trucks of his Climax locomotive as the drive shaft, and Stillman referred to the shaft linking the <b>crankshaft</b> to the <b>rear</b> axle of his shaft-driven bicycle as a drive shaft. [...] In 1899, Bukey used the term to describe the shaft transmitting power from the wheel to the driven machinery by a universal joint in his Horse-Power. [...] In the same year, Clark described his Marine Velocipede using the term to refer to the gear-driven shaft transmitting power through a universal joint to the propeller shaft. [...] Crompton used the term to refer to the shaft between the transmission of his steam-powered Motor Vehicle of 1903 and the driven axle.|$|R
40|$|In {{practice}} during {{repair of}} engines crankshaft, {{as well as}} during its impairment, we face up phenomena of high intensity wear or malfunction on the crankshaft journal that is located close {{to the front of}} the <b>rear</b> <b>crankshaft</b> journal, in direction of power transmission. This happens due to the elevated load concentrated on that crankshaft journal. Determination of forces and torques that act on the crankshaft journals can be derived from various methods that can be found in literature. Determination of forces and torques that act on the crankshaft journals firstly requires determination of forces that act on components of engines mechanism: piston, connecting rod and crankpins of the crankshaft. In this paper, calculation of reactions on crankshaft journals is done according to literature [1], where in computation of reactions on the crankshaft journals; the effects of detached parts of the crankshaft is taking into consideration by substituting them with torques located above the supporters, in the analyses rod. This is a method that differs from classical methods, in which the effect of other rods of crankshaft is not taken into consideration...|$|R
50|$|The D.III {{featured}} a rather prominent overhead cam operating the single {{intake and exhaust}} valves, powered by a shaft running up from the <b>crankshaft</b> at the <b>rear</b> of the engine. Ignition was provided by two sets of spark plugs, one located {{on either side of}} the cylinders, each powered by a separate magneto for redundancy. The ignition cables were protected in tubes running down either side of the cylinders. Fuel was fed into the cylinders via pipes on the port side of the engine, supplied from a twin-barrel carburetor located just above the crankcase. Both the fuel and oil reservoirs were pressurized by an air compressor run off the crank.The only obvious design change from the earlier D.II was to use separate cooling jackets for each cylinder, whereas the D.II used one jacket each for a trio of adjacent pairs of cylinders. Daimler also used the pistons of the D.III to produce the reduction geared, eight-cylinder 220 hp Mercedes D.IV during this period, but it did not see widespread use. The lengthened crankshaft of the D.IV proved prone to breaking.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, one Marx product line showed a greater sophistication in toy offerings. The [...] "Fix All" [...] series was introduced, whose main {{attraction}} was larger plastic vehicles (about 14 inches long) {{that could be}} taken apart and put back together with included tools and equipment. A 1953 Pontiac convertible (erroneously identified on packaging as a sedan), and a 1953 Mercury Monterey station wagon which featured an articulated drive-line. Everything from the pistons to the <b>crankshaft</b> to the <b>rear</b> axle gears were visible through clear plastic, and wood-trim decals for the sides finished off this marvelous model. A very large 1953 Chrysler convertible, a 1953 Jaguar XK120 roadster, a WWII-era Willys Jeep, a Dodge-ish utility truck, a tow truck, a tractor, a larger scale motorcycle, a helicopter, {{and a couple of}} airplanes were all part of the Fix All series. The cars' boxes boasted features like [...] "Over 50 parts" [...] and [...] "For a real mechanic!" [...] As an example, the tow truck came with cast metal box and open wrenches, an adjustable end wrench, a two-piece jack, gas can, hammer, screwdriver, and fire extinguisher. The Jeep came with a star wrench, a screw jack and working lights.|$|R
