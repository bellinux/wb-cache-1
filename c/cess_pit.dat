50|$|There {{was a large}} {{depression}} on a west to east alignment, the Nor' Loch, with Princes Street and the New Town to {{the north}} of it, and the Old Town to the south. This had been a disgusting refuse and <b>cess</b> <b>pit,</b> but it was somewhat improved in 1820 when two sets of gardens were made on the area. It was on this land that the North British Railway terminal for Edinburgh was built; the passenger station was immediately east of the North Bridge, and the goods station was squeezed in east of that {{on the north side of}} the line.|$|E
50|$|Poop-Decker wakes and dons a {{dress to}} cover his long johns, and downstairs, along with a <b>cess</b> <b>pit</b> cleaner named Walter Sweetly (Charles Hawtrey), is shanghaied by a press gang run by the Venus First Officer Lieutenant Jonathan Howett (Donald Houston) and his bosun, Mr Angel (Percy Herbert). They come to when at sea and are {{introduced}} to Captain Fearless (Kenneth Williams). Poop-Decker makes himself known, but {{there is already a}} Midshipman Poop-Decker aboardSally, in disguise. Poop-Decker, as a hopeless seaman, goes on to continually upset Howett by doing the wrong thing. Sally reveals her true identity to Poop-Decker after he has been punished, and he decides to let things continue as they are. Eventually, {{in the course of the}} film Poop-Decker and Sally fall in love with each other.|$|E
25|$|Blackwater from toilets {{could be}} held in conservancy tanks instead of open septic tanks and <b>cess</b> <b>pits</b> and then emptied and transported to biogas reactors; {{alternatively}} the toilets could be connected to biogas reactors.|$|R
40|$|The Target Species and the Need for Alternatives The {{predominant}} mosquito {{in tropical}} urban areas is Culex quinquefasciatus which breeds in polluted water in wet pit latrines, imperfectly sealed <b>cess</b> <b>pits,</b> blocked or slowly flowing open drains and polluted marshy ground (Curtis and Feachem, 1981). It {{is the main}} vector of Bancroftia...|$|R
50|$|The married {{quarters}} are located immediately {{adjacent to the}} single men's quarters and include huts, two communal kitchens (one later converted into accommodation), a garden area, <b>cess</b> <b>pits,</b> a midden, and general laundry buildings. Former structures are marked by concrete pads. At least five huts in this section may have been occupied by single patients and follow the same pattern as that seen in the other single patients sections. Generally, the hut pads in the {{married quarters}} differ from the single patient's hut pads by {{an extension of the}} pad for a personal kitchen. Each hut pad has an edge lip (of varying width) that runs three sides of the hut pad and along the inner side of the veranda (where they exist) but not on the outer side of the veranda. Iron bed frames are scattered in the area. A 35 sqm garden area is located behind the second, more southerly, kitchen. At the south-eastern extremity of the married quarters and adjacent to a tidal creek are two possible <b>cess</b> <b>pits</b> and two rectangular concrete pads (probably general laundry building remains). There is a midden on the creek bank which contains shells of clam and oyster, brown bottle debris, ceramic fragments, metal, and assorted domestic artefacts.|$|R
25|$|The Citizen Report Card {{moreover}} {{indicates that}} septic tanks {{are often used}} for the disposal of wastewater from flush toilets in Mombasa. Pit latrine users from Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa indicated that some wastewater empties into storm sewers, soak-aways and <b>cess</b> <b>pits</b> designed for kitchen waste, thus causing environmental pollution. In 2001 a pollution incident occurred {{in the town of}} Embu. Raw sewage was discharged from sewage treatment works into a nearby river and caused the death of 28 people who used the water downstream for domestic purposes.|$|R
40|$|Bulk {{chemical}} analysis was undertaken on samples taken from 143 negative features (wells, <b>pits,</b> post-holes, <b>cess</b> <b>pits</b> and ditches) across {{the area of}} excavation at Silchester Hampshire {{in order to help}} us understand the disposal of waste during late Iron Age and earliest Roman occupation. Results show {{that it is possible to}} split features into waste disposal which included animal/human waste and those which probably did not. It is also possible to identify post-holes based on organic matter content. This work forms part of the larger Town Life project run by the University of Reading...|$|R

40|$|Integrated control {{measures}} against Culex quinquefasciastus {{have been implemented}} in a pilot urban area in Recife, Brazil. About 3, 000 breeding sites found within the operational area were responsible for very high mosquito densities recorded during the pretrial period. Physical {{control measures}} have been applied to <b>cess</b> <b>pits</b> before starting a series of 37 treatments of the other sites with Bacillus sphaericus strain 2362, over 27 months. In spite of the difficulties due to environmental conditions, very significant reductions in preimaginal population of C. quinquefasciatus were achieved and, as a consequence, low adult mosquito densities were maintained for a relatively long period of time. Entomological and environmental data gathered in this pilot project can contribute to design an integrated mosquito control program in Recife city...|$|R

40|$|Excavations by Exeter Museums Archaeological Field Unit between October and November 1988 {{in advance}} of road {{alterations}} at The Acorn Roundabout site (immediately outside the Roman and medieval South Gate and City Wall) centered at SX 92160 92250. Earliest features and finds include three Pre-Roman Pits and three small Bronze Age pottery sherds. Roman military post-holes were also discovered. Early medieval activity on the site consists of a pit (earliest feature), two ditches {{and a group of}} stake and post holes, possibly relating to a structure, potentially an oven and a large number of <b>cess</b> <b>pits.</b> Civil War defenses consisted of two parallel (zigzagging pattern) ditches in front of the South gate and a larger inner ditch.

40|$|Abstract-A {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{in the laboratory}} to compare the effects of spore dust and sawdust formulations of Bacillus thuringiensis var israeler~sis and B. sphaericus on immatures of laboratory and field samples of C. quinquefasciatus. Various types of ecological niches including <b>cess</b> <b>pits,</b> cement tanks and 'U' drain which form the habitats of the mosquitoes, were selected for this study. Bacilli formulations were tested against 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th instar larvae of laboratory and field collected samples as mentioned above and the LC 50 values were determined by computer analyses. The LCsos of B. t/luringiensis were {{compared with those of}} B. sphaericus and it was concluded from this study that B. rhuringiensis is highly toxic to all stages of larvae in laboratory and field habitats. Both sawdust formulations produced 80 - 100 % mortality after 24 hrs. in all stages of larvae from three habitats and in laboratory samples at 0. 005 % concentration. It was concluded from these results that B. rhuringiensis is a more effective biocide than B. spkuericus in moderate and tropical conditions...|$|R
5000|$|By 28 April, {{police were}} now {{convinced}} that McLean was dead, and ordered search teams to examine sewers and <b>cess</b> <b>pits</b> {{around the area}} of Argyle Street. The following day, Tanner surprised police by agreeing {{to take part in}} a press conference and reconstruction of what he claimed were their final movements. During an hour-long re-enactment, with PC Helen Kay playing McLean's role, Tanner posed in the station cafe, strolled along the platform and replayed the final embrace and kiss they shared before he boarded the train. Pressed by reporters, Tanner stated: [...] "I did not kill her. I don't know what happened to her. In my heart of hearts I know she is still alive." [...] As a result of the reconstruction, two independent witnesses placed Tanner at the station but not McLean. At the beginning of May, police contacted Oxfordshire County Council for details regarding the layout of houses in Argyle Street, particularly about their basements. They were told that there were no basements in the houses, but an official remembered the houses were underpinned, which meant there were cavities under the floors.|$|R
