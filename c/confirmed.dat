40|$|A {{new concept}} of society-oriented {{designated}} <b>confirmer</b> signatures (SDCS) is introduced in this paper. SDCS {{is well suited}} to applications where the capability of the signer {{and that of the}} <b>confirmer</b> are both expected to be shared among a group of individuals.

Based on the techniques of threshold cryptography, a concrete SDCS scheme is proposed and its security is analyzed. Ordinary designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures and threshold designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures can be regarded as special cases of the proposed society-oriented designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures. Meanwhile, our scheme can be converted into an ordinary signature scheme or a designated verifier signature scheme...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Eye gaze {{tracking}} {{is an obvious}} candidate for a future input device, perhaps even for everyday computing. The hard problems with gaze-controlled interfaces are inaccuracy and inadvertent clicking. We attempt to mitigate these problems {{in the context of}} a gaze-controlled web browser. Four click alternatives (Dwell, Single <b>Confirm,</b> Multiple <b>Confirm</b> and Radial <b>Confirm)</b> were implemented along with a fifth mouse-controlled version for comparison. Two alternatives make use of additional buttons that <b>confirm</b> a selection made previously by dwell, hence improving accuracy. Our results indicate that the Multiple <b>Confirm</b> alternative performed best among the gaze-based alternatives; it makes use of multiple confirmation buttons when letting the user choose between different options. When compared to the mouse, the clicking times were worse but the accuracy was indistinguishable. User feedback also indicates that, although mouse was considered best, Multiple <b>Confirm</b> was not perceived as slow and generated excitement. This indicates that the Multiple <b>Confirm</b> click alternative has potential as an interaction method for gaze interfaces...|$|R

This paper proposes several practical constructions to multiple designated <b>confirmer</b> signature schemes. We employ the message- dependent proof of equality of the discrete logarithm and trap-door commitments to construct a new type of multiple <b>confirmer</b> scheme, where specified verifiers designated by the signer would have an advantage in verifying a signature where only one (out of n) <b>confirmer</b> is needed for a confirmation. Other verifiers, who the signer did not designate, must ask all n confirmers to collaboratively <b>confirm</b> this signature. This paper also provides an efficient and practical solution in applying the threshold functions on the designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures...|$|R
