40|$|Non {{destructive}} {{estimation of}} the carburize case depth by using ultrasonic Rayleigh waves in a 8620 - H low carbon steel. Before the experimental work the relationship between backscattered Rayleigh wave amplitude and <b>carburized</b> <b>depth</b> was investigated. These studies depend on the concept that the amplitude of backscattered waves is attenuated by the microstructure according to a combined law established between the attenuation coefficient of the carburized case and the noncarburized base material, confirming {{the results of the}} theoretical study. The amplitude of the backscattered Rayleigh wave was measured in four tests of different thicknesses of the carburized case. These measurements indicated that the amplitude of the wave decreases exponentially in accordance with the carburized case measured, as an expression which contracts with the theoretical investigation. Se llevó a cabo la estimación no destructiva de la capa cementada utilizando ondas ultrasónicas Rayleigh en un acero 8620 -H de bajo contenido de carbono, determinándose la relación entre la amplitud de la onda dispersada Rayleigh y la profundidad de capa cementada. Estas investigaciones parten del concepto de que la amplitud de la onda dispersada es atenuada por la microestructura de acuerdo a una ley de mezclas entre el coeficiente de atenuación de la capa cementada y la no cementada (material base), confirmándose con ello la investigación teórica. La amplitud de la onda dispersada Rayleigh se medió en 4 tipos de probetas de diferentes espesores de acero cementado. Estas mediciones indican que la amplitud de la onda dispersada decrece exponencialmente de acuerdo con los espesores medidos de cementación, como una expresión contrastante a la investigación teórica...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to examine the}} {{residual}} stress distribution in carburized steel components subjected to shot peening. A numerical model of the shot peening was developed by means of the ABAQUS explicit code, taking into account the variation in the material mechanical properties from the surface towards the core, defined on the base of the microhardness profile experimentally measured. The rate dependent hardening of the material was also considered for these analyses, together with the softening due to the heat generation during the impact. The model was verified by experimental residual stress measurements carried out on disk specimens, carburized and shot peened as in a typical industrial application. The analyses, repeated for different values of shot velocity and dimensions, show the influence of these parameters and that of the <b>carburizing</b> <b>depth</b> on the final residual stress distribution...|$|R
50|$|Carbonitriding forms a hard, {{wear-resistant}} case, {{is typically}} 0.07 mm to 0.5 mm thick, and generally has higher hardness than a <b>carburized</b> case. Case <b>depth</b> is {{tailored to the}} application; a thicker case increases the wear life of the part. Carbonitriding alters only the top layers of the workpiece; and does not deposit an additional layer, so the process does not significantly alter {{the dimensions of the}} part.|$|R
40|$|The present {{work was}} {{undertaken}} {{in order to}} study the possibility of case hardening of a plain steel using the Plasma Transferred Arc (PTA) alloying process. It was found that, depending on the PTA operation parameters and cooling rates, either carburizing or case hardening can be obtained. The <b>depth</b> of <b>carburizing</b> reaches a <b>depth</b> up to 1 mm and can be pre-selected by adjusting the PTA operation parameters. Due to the beneficial effect of carburizing with the PTA alloying technique, wear resistance of the treated surface is significantly improved. (C) 2003 Kluwer Academic Publishers...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} deformation behavior of carburized steel parts after quenching and tempering, the residual stress field that was distributed under hardening layer of a transmission gear was nondestructively measured by neutron diffraction. The material was chromium-molybdenum steel, SCM 420. The <b>carburized</b> case <b>depth</b> was first determined by microscope, and then was measured by micro Vickers hardness tester. The neutron diffractions from Fe- 110 and 211 planes were used for stress measurement. In this study, residual stresses were calculated from lattice spacing changes. Unstressed lattice spacing was experimentally determined using reference coupon specimens that were cut from the same carburized gear. As the results, the interior of transmission gear deformed elastically to accommodate the generation of compressive residual stresses in surface hardening layer. This interior elastic deformation was found to result in the complicated residual stresses under hardening layer. Large tensile residual stress parallel to the axial direction of gear was generated in the shift fork groove. Furthermore, tensile residual stresses parallel to the hoop and axial directions were also generated in two gear wheels...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{character}} of the original source materials and the nature of batch digitization, quality control issues may be present in this document. Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The research described in this thesis involves the use of surface acoustic waves to interrogate materials with property gradients, such as <b>carburized</b> steel, for <b>depth</b> of the surface treatment. A 3. 5 MHz wedge transducer was used to generate Rayleigh waves which were detected with a fiber optic based interferometer. Experimental dispersion data, phase velocity as a function of frequency, was calculated from the recorded displacement-time waveforms. The phase velocity was lower in the carburized case of the material which has a greater carbon content and hardness value. Dispersion was observed by plotting phase velocity versus wavelength/residual case depth ratio. A linear fit was applied to the data with wavelength/residual case depth less than 2, and using this fit, {{it would be possible to}} non-destructively estimate case depth...|$|R
40|$|This {{program was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} microalloy-modified grade of standard carburizing steel that can successfully exploit the high temperature carburizing capabilities of current commercial low pressure (i. e. 'vacuum') carburizing systems. Such steels can lower {{the amount of energy}} required for commercial carburizing operations by reducing the time required for deep-case carburizing operations. The specific technical objective of the work was to demonstrate a carburizing steel composition capable of maintaining a prior austenite grain size no larger than ASTM grain size number 5 after exposure to simulated carburizing conditions of 1050 C for 8 hr. Such thermal exposure should be adequate for producing <b>carburized</b> case <b>depths</b> up to about 2 mm. Such carburizing steels are expected to be attractive for use across a wide range of industries, including the petroleum, chemical, forest products, automotive, mining and industrial equipment industries. They have potential for reducing energy usage during low pressure carburizing by more than 25 %, as well as reducing cycle times and process costs substantially. They also have potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from existing low pressure carburizing furnaces by more than 25 %. High temperature carburizing can be done in most modern low pressure carburizing systems with no additional capital investment. Accordingly, implementing this technology on carburizing furnaces will provide a return on investment significantly greater than 10 %. If disseminated throughout the domestic carburizing community, the technology has potential for saving on the order of 23 to 34 trillion BTU/year in industrial energy usage. Under the program, two compositions of microalloyed, coarsening-resistant low alloy carburizing steels were developed, produced and evaluated. After vacuum annealing at 1050 oC for 8 hrs and high pressure gas quenching, both steels exhibited a prior austenite ASTM grain size number of 5. 0 or finer. For comparison, a control alloy of similar composition but without the microalloy additions exhibited a duplex prior austenite grain size with grains ranging from ASTM grain size 3 down to ASTM grain size 1 after similar processing and thermal exposure. These results confirm the potential for using microalloy additions of Ti, B, Nb, Al, rare earths and/or N for austenite grain size control in Cr-Mo (i. e. 4000 -series) low alloy carburizing steels. They also demonstrate that these microalloy additions will not compromise the processability of the steel; all three materials produced under the program could be hot worked readily using normal steel processing protocols. To fully realize the technical and commercial potential of these steels, {{there is a need to}} continue development work using larger-scale heats. These larger-scale heats are needed to provide adequate material for fatigue testing of quenched and tempered alloys, to conduct more complete investigations of potential alloy chemistries and to provide additional material for processing studies. It will also be beneficial to carefully review intellectual property issues associated with this family of steels, since existing Japanese patent literature suggests that significant microstructural and/or process characterization work may be needed on new materials to confirm that these materials fall outside existing patent claims...|$|R
