40|$|<b>Cyclic</b> data <b>structures</b> can {{be tricky}} to create and {{manipulate}} in declarative programming languages. In a declarative setting, a natural way to view <b>cyclic</b> <b>structures</b> is as denoting regular trees, those trees which may be infinite but have only {{a finite number of}} distinct subtrees. This paper shows how to implement the unfold (anamorphism) operator in both eager and lazy languages so as to create <b>cyclic</b> <b>structures</b> when the result is a regular tree as opposed to merely infinite lazy structures. The usual fold (catamorphism) operator when used with a strict combining function on any infinite tree yields an undefined result.

25|$|Robert Schumann {{continued}} {{the development of}} <b>cyclic</b> <b>structure.</b> In his Piano Quintet in Eflat, Op. 44, Schumann wrote a double fugue in the finale, using {{the theme of the}} first movement and the theme of the last movement. Both Schumann and Mendelssohn, following the example set by Beethoven, revived the fugue, which had fallen out of favor since the Baroque period. However, rather than writing strict, full-length fugues, they used counterpoint as another mode of conversation between the chamber music instruments. Many of Schumann's chamber works, including all three of his string quartets and his piano quartet have contrapuntal sections interwoven seamlessly into the overall compositional texture.|$|E
500|$|Liszt {{found his}} method through two {{compositional}} practices, {{which he used}} in his symphonic poems. The first practice was cyclic form, a procedure established by Beethoven in which certain movements are not only linked but actually reflect one another's content. Liszt took Beethoven's practice one step further, combining separate movements into a single-movement <b>cyclic</b> <b>structure.</b> Many of Liszt's mature works follow this pattern, of which Les préludes {{is one of the}} best-known examples. The second practice was thematic transformation, a type of variation in which one theme is changed, not into a related or subsidiary theme but into something new, separate and independent. Thematic transformation, like cyclic form, was nothing new in itself; it had already been used by Mozart and Haydn. In the final movement of his Ninth Symphony, Beethoven had transformed the theme of the [...] "Ode to Joy" [...] into a Turkish march. Weber and Berlioz had also transformed themes, and Schubert used thematic transformation to bind together the movements of his Wanderer Fantasy, a work that had a tremendous influence on Liszt. However, Liszt perfected the creation of significantly longer formal structures solely through thematic transformation, not only in the symphonic poems but in other works such as his Second Piano Concerto and his Piano Sonata in B minor. In fact, when a work had to be shortened, Liszt tended to cut sections of conventional musical development and preserve sections of thematic transformation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{exploration}} of tonality and of structure begun by Brahms was continued by composers of the French school. César Franck's piano quintet in F minor, composed in 1879, further established the cyclic form first explored by Schumann and Mendelssohn, reusing the same thematic material {{in each of}} the three movements. [...] Claude Debussy's string quartet, Op. 10, is considered a watershed in the history of chamber music. The quartet uses the <b>cyclic</b> <b>structure,</b> and constitutes a final divorce from the rules of classical harmony. [...] "Any sounds in any combination and in any succession are henceforth free to be used in a musical continuity", Debussy wrote. Pierre Boulez said that Debussy freed chamber music from [...] "rigid structure, frozen rhetoric and rigid aesthetics".|$|E

Aggregation is especially evident for charge-neutral organocopper compounds, i.e. species with the empirical formula (RCu), which adopt cyclic structures. [...] Since each copper center requires {{at least two}} ligands, the organic group is a bridging ligand. [...] This effect {{is illustrated by the}} structure of mesitylcopper, which is a pentamer. A <b>cyclic</b> <b>structure</b> is also seen for CuCH2SiMe3, first 1:1 organocopper compound to be analyzed by X-ray [...] crystallography (1972 by Lappert). This compound is relatively stable because the bulky trimethylsilyl groups provide steric protection. It is a tetramer, forming an 8-membered ring with alternating Cu-C bonds. In addition the four copper atoms form a planar Cu4 ring based on three-center two-electron bonds. The copper to copper bond length is 242 pm compared to 256 pm in bulk copper. In pentamesitylpentacopper a 5-membered copper ring is formed, similar to (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)gold, and pentafluorophenylcopper is a tetramer.|$|E
2500|$|Historic {{interest}} in benzene {{arose from the}} uncertainty over its structure and reactivity. [...] It was well established {{that it had a}} carbon to hydrogen ratio of 1:1 which suggested the presence of double or triple bond carbon-to-carbon bonds, yet such unsaturated compounds typically undergo addition reactions, which benzene does not. [...] Numerous potential structures were proposed, including by Claus, Dewar, Ladenburg, Armstrong, and Thiele. [...] The most influential proposal was that of Kekulé who in 1865 suggested a <b>cyclic</b> <b>structure</b> of six carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds [...] Kekulé based his argument on the now well-known observations of arene substitution patterns, namely that there are always only one isomer of any monoderivative of benzene and three isomers of every disubstituted derivative. [...] Critics noted that Kekulé's proposal implied that there should be two distinguishable isomers for an ortho-substitution (a 1,2-disubstituion) depending on whether a single or double bond joined these two carbons. [...] Kekulé suggested in reply that benzene had two complementary structures and that these forms rapidly interconverted, which would also explain the lack of addition reactions (as the valency of each carbon atom is not that expected of a double bond). [...] Though this interconversion is incorrect —in fact, they are both resonance contributors to the actual structure (which is closest to Thiele's structure)— the geometry and structure proposed by Kekulé are correct. [...] Benzene is the prototypical example of an aromatic compound, a hitherto unknown class of compounds, and its synthesis was the first example of aromatization, the process and chemical reactions whereby an aromatic system is formed. [...] The new understanding of benzene and all aromatic compounds was so important for both pure and applied chemistry that in 1890 the German Chemical Society organized an elaborate appreciation in Kekulé's honor, celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of his first benzene paper; its 150th anniversary was also marked.

40|$|In digital communications, {{conventional}} linear {{and decision}} feedback equalizers are optimal for stationary signals [1].

40|$|Abstract Background Bayesian {{networks}} (BNs) {{have been}} widely used to estimate gene regulatory networks. Many BN methods have been developed to estimate networks from microarray data. However, two serious problems reduce the effectiveness of current BN methods. The first problem is that BN-based methods require huge computational time to estimate large-scale networks. The second is that the estimated network cannot have <b>cyclic</b> <b>structures,</b> even if the actual network has such structures. Results In this paper, we present a novel BN-based deterministic method with reduced computational time that allows <b>cyclic</b> <b>structures.</b> Our approach generates all the combinational triplets of genes, estimates networks of the triplets by BN, and unites the networks into a single network containing all genes. This method decreases the search space of predicting gene regulatory networks without degrading the solution accuracy compared with the greedy hill climbing (GHC) method. The order of computational time is the cube of number of genes. In addition, the network estimated by our method can include <b>cyclic</b> <b>structures.</b> Conclusions We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method for all known gene regulatory networks and their expression profiles. The results demonstrate that this approach can predict regulatory networks with reduced computational time without degrading the solution accuracy compared with the GHC method. </p...|$|R
