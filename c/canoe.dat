5|$|The annual Queen Liliʻuokalani Outrigger <b>Canoe</b> Race, {{that follows}} an 18-mile course from Kailua Bay to Honaunau Bay, was {{organized}} in 1972 as an endurance training course for men, {{in preparation for}} the traditional Molokaʻi to Oʻahu <b>canoe</b> races. Women <b>canoe</b> teams were added in 1974. The race is held over Labor Day Weekend each year to coincide with Liliʻuokalani's birthday on September 2.|$|E
5|$|An {{aboriginal}} Australian fable retold by the Welsh school headmaster William Jenkyn Thomas (1870–1959) {{tells how}} some animals needed a <b>canoe</b> {{to cross the}} ocean. Whale had one but refused to lend it, so Starfish kept him busy, telling him stories and grooming him to remove parasites, while the others stole the <b>canoe.</b> When Whale realized the trick he beat Starfish ragged, which is how Starfish still is today.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 International <b>Canoe</b> Federation (ICF) <b>Canoe</b> Sprint World Championships {{were held}} 12–16 August 2009 in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada, on Lake Banook. The Canadian city was {{selected}} to host the championships in October 2003 after having done so previously in 1997. Final preparations were made after the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, with competition format changed {{for the first time}} since the 2001 championships. Four exhibition events for both paddleability and women's <b>canoe</b> were added. Sponsorship was local within the province of Nova Scotia and the Halifax Regional Municipality. Media coverage was provided from Canada, Europe and the United States on the Internet, television and mobile phone. 669 canoeists from 68 nations participated at the championships themselves.|$|E
25|$|Tongan {{craftsman}} {{were also}} adept at building <b>canoes.</b> Many <b>canoes</b> {{for daily use}} were simple pōpaos, dug-out <b>canoes,</b> shaped from a single log with fire and adze and outfitted with a single outrigger. Due to a dearth of large trees suitable for building large war <b>canoes,</b> these <b>canoes</b> were often imported from Fiji.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} {{outrigger}} sailing <b>canoes</b> ranging from smaller three or four-person <b>canoes</b> to large voyaging <b>canoes.</b> Sailing <b>canoes</b> may have one ama, two amas (one on each side, {{but only one}} side is normally {{in contact with the}} water), or a double-hull configuration (like a catamaran).|$|R
50|$|The Achomawi made simple dugout <b>canoes</b> of pine or cedar. Longer, {{thinner and}} less {{detailed}} than the Yurok redwood boats and Modoc <b>canoes,</b> the <b>canoes</b> were produced simply for transportation and hunting.|$|R
5|$|To {{steer the}} <b>canoe</b> in mid-ocean on a {{consistent}} course, the navigator selects a star and keeps the <b>canoe</b> pointed toward it. Should it become cloud-blocked, or rise too high in the sky, he selects another star but offsets his reference to remain true to the first, or steers at the same relative angle to the swell as when steering toward the star.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy {{has four}} basic game modes: an overworld map, town and dungeon maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a {{scaled-down}} {{version of the}} game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. The primary means of travel across the overworld is by foot; a <b>canoe,</b> a ship, and an airship become available as the player progresses. With the exception of some battles in preset locations or with bosses, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld map when traveling by foot, <b>canoe,</b> or ship, and must either be fought or fled from.|$|E

50|$|Cluster A {{consists}} of three individual burial <b>canoes</b> (<b>canoes</b> 1, 2 and 3) constructed a few meters apart. Orientation of all the <b>canoes</b> is north-south. Careful study suggests that this placement was intentional as a precaution from the predictable hazards caused by the flow of rain water in the slope where the <b>canoes</b> were constructed.|$|R
50|$|All {{tribes in}} the North-west hunted for {{food in the}} sea. They built great {{seagoing}} <b>canoes.</b> Some were more than 60 feet long. They built the <b>canoes</b> from the trunks of huge cedar and redwood trees. The <b>canoes</b> could hold as many as 60 men.

5|$|On 30 July 1502, {{during his}} fourth voyage, Christopher Columbus arrived at Guanaja, {{one of the}} Bay Islands {{off the coast of}} Honduras. He sent his brother Bartholomew to scout the island. As Bartholomew {{explored}} the island with two boats, a large <b>canoe</b> approached from the west, apparently en route to the island. The <b>canoe</b> was carved from one large tree trunk and was powered by twenty-five naked rowers. Curious as to the visitors, Bartholomew Columbus seized and boarded it. He found it was a Maya trading <b>canoe</b> from Yucatán, carrying well-dressed Maya and a rich cargo that included ceramics, cotton textiles, yellow stone axes, flint-studded war clubs, copper axes and bells, and cacao. Also among the cargo were a small number of women and children, probably destined to be sold as slaves, as were a number of the rowers. The Europeans looted whatever took their interest from amongst the cargo and seized the elderly Maya captain to serve as an interpreter; the <b>canoe</b> was then allowed to continue on its way. It is likely that news of the piratical strangers in the Caribbean passed along the Maya trade routes.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the history of}} New England’s dugout <b>canoes</b> – a history that can be traced from 8500 BCE to the twenty-first century. The historical record and archaeological evidence surrounding dugout <b>canoes</b> suggests {{that the use of}} dugout <b>canoes</b> changed significantly over time, and that their form varied considerably in different regions of New England. While historians have claimed that these varied forms represent European and colonial influences, I argue that the Eurcolonial influence on dugouts was much more visible in the way the <b>canoes</b> were used than in the shape the vessels took. In addition to analyzing the <b>canoes,</b> this study analyzes the ways in which dugout <b>canoes</b> have been exhibited and interpreted in museums and offer suggestions as to best practices in the interpretation of mishoonash as artifacts of contested cultural attribution...|$|R

5|$|The Games hosted 6,132 athletes {{representing}} 41 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) in the Americas, {{marking the}} largest multi-sport event hosted in Canada, {{in terms of}} athletes competing. A record of 45% of competitors were women, the most ever for any multi-sport event. 364 events were contested in 36 sports, which included the 28 sports contested at the 2016 Summer Olympics; certain sports also served as qualification paths for these Olympics. <b>Canoe</b> slalom and golf made their Pan American Games debut, as well as women's competitions in baseball, C-1 <b>canoe</b> and rugby sevens.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, {{the shift}} towards using dugout <b>canoes</b> maximized the overall {{possibilities}} of seafarers. Not only did increased sturdiness, speed {{and stability of}} Dugout <b>canoes</b> make hunting easier, but these characteristics also allowed for long-distance travel. Whereas Bark <b>canoes</b> had been only used for inland use or travel extremely close to the shore, Dugout <b>canoes</b> offered a far greater range of travel which allowed for trade outside {{the area of the}} village. Dugout <b>canoes</b> were capable of traveling distances over 500 km. This new vessel gave the Aboriginal people the ability and opportunity to explore, trade and locate additional resources located outside the central location.|$|R

5|$|Timberlake's party left Long Island on November 28, 1761. The Holston River's unusually {{low water}} levels almost {{immediately}} stalled the journey, {{as the party}} was forced to drag their <b>canoe</b> over exposed shoals and sandbars. The party ran out of provisions after several days, but McCormack managed to shoot a bear, supplying them with several days' worth of meat. Around December 7, the party explored a stalactite-filled cave situated approximately 50 feet above the river. Timberlake described an incident in which Sumter swam nearly a half-mile in the near-freezing river waters to retrieve their <b>canoe,</b> which had somehow drifted away while they were exploring the cave.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 36 sports, 51 {{disciplines}} and 364 medal events were contested in these Games. Basque pelota {{was the only}} sport dropped from the last games. Golf (after being added to the Olympic program for 2016) also made its Pan American Games debut. <b>Canoe</b> slalom, the only Olympic discipline never to have been held at the Games, also made its debut, meaning {{for the first time}} the entire Olympic sports program was contested. Furthermore, both <b>canoe</b> disciplines had C-1 events for women for the first time. Women's baseball and women's rugby sevens also made their debuts, with men's softball returning to the program, after last being contested in 2003. A total of 19 sports (the most ever) were direct or indirect (such as opportunities to gain qualification times) qualifiers for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E

50|$|Walter Grant's prior {{connection}} to Morris suggests {{a reason for}} similarities between the <b>canoes</b> of Kennebec and B.N. Morris. The Morris is known for having stems made of cedar, rather than hardwood. The cedar stem widens to three inches at its end and is diagnostic of the <b>canoes</b> built by B.N. Morris. Some Kennebec <b>canoes</b> share this feature as well, yet their profiles are that {{of the majority of}} Kennebec <b>canoes,</b> which have a narrow, hardwood stem. Terry hired men who had learned the trade from Morris, {{as well as those who}} had worked elsewhere, and apparently gave the men free rein when it came to building <b>canoes</b> as it was not his field of expertise.|$|R

5|$|Additional laws {{focused on}} {{protecting}} the area's rustic and undeveloped character. In 1948, the Thye-Blatnik Bill authorized {{the government to}} purchase the few remaining privately owned homes and resorts within the area. In 1949, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 10092 which prohibited aircraft from flying over the area below 4,000 feet. The area was officially named the Boundary Waters <b>Canoe</b> Area in 1958. The Wilderness Act of 1964 organized it as {{a unit of the}} National Wilderness Preservation System. The 1978 Boundary Waters <b>Canoe</b> Area Wilderness Act established the Boundary Waters regulations much as they are today, with limitations on motorboats and snowmobiles, a permit-based quota system for recreational access, and restrictions on logging and mining within the area.|$|E

40|$|Outrigger <b>canoes</b> have {{outriggers}} {{on one or}} {{both sides}} to increase their seaworthiness. The <b>canoes</b> with one outrigger float, single riggers, are often found around the Tropical Pacific area, while double riggers with outriggers on both sides are mainly ranged in areas from the Philippines to Indonesia. A series of measuremental surveys of 14 single riggers, was undertaken at Ulithi Atoll, Yap of Micronesia and Rabaul, New Britain I. of Papua New Guinea {{in the month of}} November, 1986. Some statistic considerations, applied with 8 dimentional ratios of the hulls and outriggers of the 14 <b>canoes,</b> was made and their local variations in shape and size are well acertained in comparison with 145 outriggers in Philippine and Indonesia: 1) The <b>canoes</b> in Ulithi and Rabaul have an outrigger float of a tropical wood, "breadfruit tree", while Indonesian and Philippine <b>canoes</b> generally have two outrigger floats of bamboo. The Ulithi <b>canoes</b> with a short float, have symmetry hulls in profile and replace the foremost points of their two boomed triangle sails, knitted of "pandanus leaves", from one end to other end of the <b>canoes</b> as to keep wind on their float side, whenever the <b>canoes</b> greatly change their sailing directions. 2) The <b>canoes</b> have remarkable localities on their hulls and outriggers in shape and size by each location and these results are supported from some statistic considerations, including cluster analysis. One of the most distinct difference between single and double rigger <b>canoes</b> is found in shape and relative size of the outrigger booms held the floats and the length of the booms are relatively long on the single riggers. ﻿ 1) アウトリガーカヌーは,地域毎にそれぞれ異なった船型を持っている。このことは,クラスター分析の結果からも支持される。 2) シングルリガーとダブルリガーとは,特に浮体支持長の長さにおいて,明らかな相違があり,シングルリガーの方が長い。 3) ウルシーのカヌーは,幅の割に深さが深く,ラバウルのカヌーは,浅いが,いずれもアウトリガーカヌーの平均的な船型を持っている。 4) ウルシーとラバウルの浮体は,木製であり,他の地域は,竹製である。また,ウルシーのカヌーの浮体は,全 14 の地域の中で最も短く太い...|$|R
