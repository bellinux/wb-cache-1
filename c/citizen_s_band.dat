50|$|The <b>S</b> <b>band</b> is a {{designation}} by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for {{a part of}} {{the microwave}} band of the electromagnetic spectrum covering frequencies from 2 to 4 gigahertz (GHz). Thus it crosses the conventional boundary between the UHF and SHF bands at 3.0 GHz. The <b>S</b> <b>band</b> is used by weather radar, surface ship radar, and some communications satellites, especially those used by NASA to communicate with the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. The 10 cm radar short-band ranges roughly from 1.55 to 5.2 GHz. The <b>S</b> <b>band</b> also contains the 2.4-2.483 GHz ISM band, widely used for low power unlicensed microwave devices such as cordless phones, wireless headphones (Bluetooth), wireless networking (WiFi), garage door openers, keyless vehicle locks, baby monitors as well as for medical diathermy machines and microwave ovens (typically at 2.495GHz).|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model for the}} analysis and the designof <b>S</b> <b>band</b> erbium-doped fiber amplifiers has been developed. Themodel is able to accurately predict the amplifier performancesby {{taking into account the}} ASE suppression due to the bending,as well as leakage losses of the fiber used as active medium. The model has been validated by comparing numerical andexperimental data of bending loss, amplifier gain and noise figureof a <b>S</b> <b>band</b> optical amplifier based on a depressed-claddingerbium-doped fiber. A good agreement has been verified byvarying fiber bending radius, input signal power and wavelength. The model has been then applied to the optimization of theamplifier performances for WDM applications. The numericalresults show that 20 − 25 dB gain can be achieved over a 25 − 30 nm range centered in different part of the <b>S</b> <b>band</b> from 1460 nm to 1525 nm, just by changing the bending radius andthe length of a depressed-cladding fiber...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In various applications, Dual-frequency/Dual-bands are desirable. Dual Band patch antennas {{may provide}} an {{alternative}} to large-bandwidth planar antennas, in applications in which large bandwidth is really needed for operating at two separate transmit- receive bands. Now a day’s Indian Regional Navigational Satellites System (IRNSS) uses L band For GPS Applications and for Surveillance Application we are using <b>S</b> <b>band.</b> Instead of using different receiving antenna for L <b>band</b> and <b>S</b> <b>band,</b> {{it is better to}} Design Dual band antenna which can serve both of these functions. Dual-frequency/Band Microstrip antennas have the advantages for doubling the system capacity of transmission and reception. For the proposed antenna two resonant frequencies are obtained in L <b>band</b> and <b>S</b> <b>band</b> which are 1. 5 GHz and 2. 5 GHz respectively. The design and simulation of the proposed antenna is carried out using ADS (Advanced Design System) software.
