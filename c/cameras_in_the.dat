5|$|C-SPAN {{continues}} to expand its coverage of government proceedings, {{with a history of}} requests to government officials for greater access, especially to the U.S. Supreme Court. In December 2009, Lamb wrote to leaders in the House and Senate, requesting that negotiations for health care reform be televised by C-SPAN. Committee meetings on health care were broadcast subsequently by C-SPAN and may be viewed on the C-SPAN website. In November 2010, Lamb wrote to incoming House Speaker John Boehner requesting changes to restrictions on <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House. In particular, C-SPAN asked to add some of its own robotically operated cameras to the existing government-controlled <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House chamber. In February 2011, Boehner denied the request. A previous request to Speaker Designate Nancy Pelosi in 2006, to add C-SPAN's <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House chamber to record floor proceedings, was also denied. Although C-SPAN uses the congressional chamber feed cables, the cameras are owned and controlled by each respective body of Congress. Requests by C-SPAN for camera access to non-government events such as the annual dinner by the Gridiron Club have also been denied.|$|E

5|$|The {{effort to}} develop a lighter, quieter camera with a reflex {{viewfinder}} led {{to the introduction of}} the Panavision Silent Reflex (PSR) in 1967. The camera could provide a shutter angle of up to 200 degrees. Many refinements were made to the PSR during the first few years after its introduction, and it soon {{became one of the most}} popular studio <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. Panavision also began manufacturing spherical lenses for 1.85:1 photography, garnering a significant share of the market.|$|E

5|$|In March 2014, {{the tower}} was scaled by 16-year-old Weehawken, New Jersey {{resident}} Justin Casquejo, {{who entered the}} site {{through a hole in}} a fence. He was subsequently arrested on trespassing charges. He allegedly dressed like a construction worker, sneaked in, and convinced an elevator operator to lift him to the tower’s 88th floor, according to news sources. He then used stairways to get to the 104th floor, walked past a sleeping security guard, and climbed up a ladder to get to the antenna, where he took pictures for two hours. The elevator operator was reassigned, and the guard was fired. It was then revealed that officials had failed to install security <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tower, which facilitated Casquejo's entry to the site.|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, remote <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest {{captured}} {{photographs of}} OR-7 {{along with a}} female wolf who might have mated with him.

By September, tests run at the University of Idaho confirmed that OR-7's mate is a wolf, that the two pups are their offspring, and that the mate is related to the wolves in the Minam and Snake River packs of northeastern Oregon.|$|E
