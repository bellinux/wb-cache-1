5|$|The heavy isotope 15N {{was first}} {{discovered}} by S. M. Naudé in 1929, soon after heavy isotopes of the neighbouring elements oxygen and carbon were discovered. It presents {{one of the}} lowest thermal neutron capture cross-sections of all isotopes. It is frequently used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structures of nitrogen-containing molecules, due to its fractional nuclear spin of one-half, which offers advantages for NMR such as narrower line width. 14N, though also theoretically usable, has an integer nuclear spin of one and thus has a quadrupole moment that leads to wider and less useful spectra. 15N NMR nevertheless has complications not encountered in the more 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The low natural abundance of 15N (0.36%) significantly reduces sensitivity, a problem which is only exacerbated by its low gyromagnetic ratio, (only 10.14% that of 1H). As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio for 1H is about 300 times as much as that for 15N at the same magnetic field strength. This may be somewhat alleviated by isotopic enrichment of 15N by <b>chemical</b> <b>exchange</b> or fractional distillation. 15N-enriched compounds have the advantage that under standard conditions, they do not undergo <b>chemical</b> <b>exchange</b> of their nitrogen atoms with atmospheric nitrogen, unlike compounds with labelled hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen isotopes that must be kept away from the atmosphere. The 15N:14N ratio is commonly used in stable isotope analysis in the fields of geochemistry, hydrology, paleoclimatology and paleoceanography, where it is called δ15N.|$|E

To counter this, German ambassador Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff and Interior Ministry official Heinrich Albert were tasked with undermining American industry and maintaining public support for Germany.

40|$|The mineral {{chemistry}} of melanite garnets from the Crowsnest volcanic rocks of SW Alberta, Canada, {{has been investigated}} by using electron microprobe scans, quantitative analyses and multivariate statistical analysis. The garnets occur with aegirine-augite, sanidine, analcite and rare plagioclase as phenocrysts in trachyte and phonolite flows, agglomerates and tuffs. Wavelength dispersive microprobe scans reveal complex zonation patterns, both normal and oscillatory. The results of fifty quantitative analyses were subjected to R-mode factor analysis to delineate the <b>chemical</b> <b>exchanges</b> producing the zonation. The chemical zonation of the garnets {{may be attributed to}} four independent binary exchanges; Al-Fe 3 +, Si-Ti, Ca-Mn and Mg-Fe 2 +. The stoichiometry of these garnets, based on microprobe and wet chemical Fe analyses, combined with the strongly antithetic behavior of Si and Ti lead us to infer that the Ti in these garnets is dominantly tetravalent. It is clear from this study that quantitative modelling of the processes of crystal growth and zonation of melanite garnets in alkaline, undersaturated igneous rocks should be aimed at simulating the four <b>chemical</b> <b>exchanges</b> listed above. ...|$|R

2500|$|MRI has the {{advantages}} of having very high spatial resolution and is very adept at morphological imaging and functional imaging. [...] MRI does have several disadvantages though. [...] First, MRI has a sensitivity of around 10−3 mol/L [...] to 10−5 mol/L, which, compared to other types of imaging, can be very limiting. [...] This problem {{stems from the fact}} that the population difference between the nuclear spin states is very small at room temperature. [...] For example, at 1.5 teslas, a typical field strength for clinical MRI, the difference between high and low energy states is approximately 9 molecules per 2 million. Improvements to increase MR sensitivity include increasing magnetic field strength, and hyperpolarization via optical pumping or dynamic nuclear polarization.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to structures, {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} can yield information on the dynamics of {{various parts of the}} protein. This usually involves measuring relaxation times such as T1 and T2 to determine order parameters, correlation times, and <b>chemical</b> <b>exchange</b> rates. NMR relaxation is a consequence of local fluctuating magnetic fields within a molecule. Local fluctuating magnetic fields are generated by molecular motions. In this way, measurements of relaxation times can provide information of motions within a molecule on the atomic level. In NMR studies of protein dynamics the nitrogen-15 isotope is the preferred nucleus to study because its relaxation times are relatively simple to relate to molecular motions [...] This, however, requires isotope labeling of the protein. The T1 and T2 relaxation times can be measured using various types of HSQC-based experiments. The types of motions that can be detected are motions that occur on a time-scale ranging from about 10 picoseconds to about 10 nanoseconds. In addition slower motions, which take place on a time-scale ranging from about 10 microseconds to 100 milliseconds, can also be studied. However, since nitrogen atoms are found mainly in the backbone of a protein, the results mainly reflect the motions of the backbone, which is the most rigid part of a protein molecule. Thus, the results obtained from nitrogen-15 relaxation measurements may not be representative for the whole protein. Therefore, techniques utilising relaxation measurements of carbon-13 and deuterium have recently been developed, which enables systematic studies of motions of the amino acid side-chains in proteins.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new quantity to petrology, the Shannon entropy, {{as a tool for}} quantifying mixing as well as the rate of production of hybrid compositions in the mixing system. The Shannon entropy approach is applied to time series numerical simulations and high-temperature experiments performed with natural melts. We note that in both cases the Shannon entropy increases linearly during the initial stages of mixing and then saturates toward constant values. Furthermore, chemical elements with different mobilities display different rates of increase of the Shannon entropy. This indicates that the hybrid composition for the different elements is attained at different times generating a wide range of spatio-compositional domains which further increase the apparent complexity of the mixing process. Results from the application of the Shannon entropy analysis are compared with the concept of Relaxation of Concentration Variance (RCV), a measure recently introduced in petrology to quantify <b>chemical</b> <b>exchanges</b> during magma mixing. We derive a linear expression relating the change of concentration variance during mixing and the Shannon entropy. We show that the combined use of Shannon entropy and RCV provides the most complete information about the space and time complexity of magma mixing. As a consequence, detailed information about this fundamental petrogenetic and volcanic process can be gathered. In particular, the Shannon entropy can be used as complement to the RCV method to quantify the mobility of chemical elements in magma mixing systems, to obtain information about the rate of production of compositional heterogeneities, and to derive empirical relationships linking the rate of <b>chemical</b> <b>exchanges</b> between interacting magmas and mixing time...|$|R
