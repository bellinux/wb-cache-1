5|$|In {{cases where}} surgery is not indicated, palliative <b>chemotherapy</b> is an option; higher-dose <b>chemotherapy</b> is {{associated}} with longer survival. Palliative <b>chemotherapy,</b> particularly using capecitabine and gemcitabine, is also often used to treat recurrent endometrial cancer.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant <b>chemotherapy</b> is {{a recent}} innovation, {{consisting}} of some combination of paclitaxel (or other taxanes like docetaxel), doxorubicin (and other anthracyclines), and platins (particularly cisplatin and carboplatin). Adjuvant <b>chemotherapy</b> {{has been found to}} increase survival in stage III and IV cancer more than added radiotherapy. Mutations in mismatch repair genes, like those found in Lynch syndrome, can lead to resistance against platins, meaning that <b>chemotherapy</b> with platins is ineffective in people with these mutations. Side effects of <b>chemotherapy</b> are common. These include hair loss, low neutrophil levels in the blood, and gastrointestinal problems.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant <b>chemotherapy</b> {{refers to}} the use of <b>chemotherapy</b> after {{apparently}} curative surgery to improve the outcome. In NSCLC, samples are taken of nearby lymph nodes during surgery to assist staging. If stage II or III disease is confirmed, adjuvant <b>chemotherapy</b> improves survival by 5% at five years. The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin is more effective than older regimens. Adjuvant <b>chemotherapy</b> for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit. <b>Chemotherapy</b> before surgery in NSCLC that can be removed surgically also appears to improve outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Topical <b>chemotherapies,</b> such as 5-fluorouracil, {{are used}} to treat some cases of non-melanoma skin cancer.|$|R
50|$|Systemic <b>chemotherapies</b> such as {{gemcitabine}} and cisplatin {{are sometimes}} used in inoperable cases of cholangiocarcinoma.|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} several decades, {{there has been little}} {{improvement}} in the morbidity and mortality associated with Acanthamoeba keratitis and Acanthamoeba encephalitis, respectively. The discovery of a plethora of antiacanthamoebic compounds has not yielded effective marketed chemotherapeutics. The rate of development of novel antiacanthamoebic <b>chemotherapies</b> of translational value and the lack of interest of the pharmaceutical industry in developing such <b>chemotherapies</b> have been disappointing. On the other hand, the market for contact lenses/contact lens disinfectants is a multi-billion-dollar industry and has been successful and profitable. A better understanding of drugs, their targets, and mechanisms of action will facilitate the development of more-effective <b>chemotherapies.</b> Here, we review the progress toward phenotypic drug discovery, emphasizing the shortcomings of useable therapies...|$|R
5|$|<b>Chemotherapy</b> may be {{combined}} with palliative care {{in the treatment of}} the NSCLC. In advanced cases, appropriate <b>chemotherapy</b> improves average survival over supportive care alone, as well as improving quality of life. With adequate physical fitness maintaining <b>chemotherapy</b> during lung cancer palliation offers 1.5 to 3 months of prolongation of survival, symptomatic relief, and an improvement in quality of life, with better results seen with modern agents. The NSCLC Meta-Analyses Collaborative Group recommends if the recipient wants and can tolerate treatment, then <b>chemotherapy</b> should be considered in advanced NSCLC.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin, {{sold under}} the trade names Adriamycin among others, is a <b>chemotherapy</b> {{medication}} {{used to treat}} cancer. This includes breast cancer, bladder cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, and acute lymphocytic leukemia. It is often used together with other <b>chemotherapy</b> agents. Doxorubicin is given by injection into a vein.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to anticancer <b>chemotherapy,</b> in {{particular}} alkylating agents, {{can increase the}} risk of subsequently developing AML. The risk is highest about three to five years after <b>chemotherapy.</b> Other <b>chemotherapy</b> agents, specifically epipodophyllotoxins and anthracyclines, have also been associated with treatment-related leukemias, which are often associated with specific chromosomal abnormalities in the leukemic cells.|$|E
50|$|SEPREHVIR (HSV-1716) {{has also}} shown synergy in pre-clinical {{research}} when used in combination with several cancer <b>chemotherapies.</b>|$|R
40|$|Intravesical {{combination}} <b>chemotherapies</b> of 20 mg of mitomycin C and 200 mg of {{cytosine arabinoside}} were {{performed in the}} sixteen patients with superficial bladder tumors. The clinical effects of these treatments were compared {{with the results of}} 6 cases with 400 mg of cytosine arabinoside alone (group 1), 27 cases with 20 mg of mitomycin C alone (group 2) and 20 cases with daily double trials of each of 20 mg of mitomycin C (group 3). The results were as follows. 1) Complete disappearances of tumors after a series of twenty times of these combination <b>chemotherapies</b> were found in 5 cases (31. 3 %), and the clinical effectiveness, complete disappearances and significant reductions of tumors, were found in 11 cases (68. 7 %). The clinical result of these combination <b>chemotherapies</b> was better than group 1 (33. 3 %) and group 2 (40. 7 %), and was as good as group 3 (80. 0 %). 2) No serious side-actions with the combination therapies were found. 3) We thought that the clinical effects on the bladder tumors were increased with these intravesical combination <b>chemotherapies...</b>|$|R
50|$|Before {{the advent}} of modern {{treatments}} such as prednisone, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, <b>chemotherapies,</b> and other drugs, the prognosis was poor.|$|R

30|$|Single use of imatinib did not showed {{sufficient}} efficacy. It {{is necessary}} to conduct a well-designed clinical trial using <b>chemotherapies</b> combined with imatinib for PTTM.|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} of cases of cholangiocarcinoma present as inoperable (unresectable) disease in which case patients are generally treated with palliative <b>chemotherapy,</b> with or without radiotherapy. <b>Chemotherapy</b> {{has been shown in}} a randomized controlled trial to improve quality of life and extend survival in patients with inoperable cholangiocarcinoma. There is no single <b>chemotherapy</b> regimen which is universally used, and enrollment in clinical trials is often recommended when possible. <b>Chemotherapy</b> agents used to treat cholangiocarcinoma include 5-fluorouracil with leucovorin, gemcitabine as a single agent, or gemcitabine plus cisplatin, irinotecan, or capecitabine. A small pilot study suggested possible benefit from the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib in patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Avoidance of risk factors, {{including}} {{smoking and}} air pollution, {{is the primary}} method of prevention. Treatment and long-term outcomes depend {{on the type of}} cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the person's overall health. Most cases are not curable. Common treatments include surgery, <b>chemotherapy,</b> and radiotherapy. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to <b>chemotherapy</b> and radiotherapy.|$|E

50|$|Flavaglines are {{a family}} of natural {{products}} that are found in plants of the genus Aglaia (Meliaceae). These compounds are characterized by a cyclopentabbenzofuran skeleton. In 1982 King and colleagues discovered {{the first member of}} this family, rocaglamide, based on its antileukemic activity. Since then, about 50 other flavaglines have been characterized. These molecules display strong insecticidal, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, cardioprotective and anticancer activities. In mouse models of cancer, flavaglines enhance the efficacy of <b>chemotherapies</b> and also alleviate the cardiac adverse effect of these <b>chemotherapies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Research on {{this class}} of drugs began in the 1950s at SRI International, where {{scientists}} were focused on developing new <b>chemotherapies</b> and antifolates that would be effective against tumor cells.|$|R
25|$|Likely, current <b>chemotherapies</b> are not effective. Antiprogestin {{agents have}} been used, but with {{variable}} results. A 2007 study of whether hydroxyurea {{has the capacity}} to shrink unresectable or recurrent meningiomas is being further evaluated.|$|R

30|$|The {{evaluation}} {{demonstrates that}} feedback-controlled scalp cooling {{provides a good}} chance for breast cancer patients to keep their hair even during (neo-)adjuvant <b>chemotherapies,</b> which are known to cause severe to complete alopecia without scalp cooling.|$|R
5000|$|A {{wide variety}} of <b>chemotherapies</b> options exist for used in {{advanced}} (metastatic) NSCLC. [...] These agents include both traditional <b>chemotherapies</b> like cisplatin which indiscriminately target all rapidly dividing cells as well as newer targeted agents which are more tailored to specific genetic aberrations found within a patient's tumor. At present there are two genetic markers which are routinely profiled in NSCLC tumors to guide further treatment decision making: mutations within EGFR and Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase. [...] There are also a number of additional genetic markers which {{are known to be}} mutated within NSCLC and may impact treatment in the future, including BRAF (gene), HER2/neu and KRAS.|$|R
50|$|New <b>chemotherapies</b> {{are being}} {{explored}} in current clinical trials for epithelioid sarcoma, although, thus far, none has shown significant {{improvement over the}} efficacy of doxorubicin/ifosfamide. These new agents include gemcitabine, pazopanib, cixutumumab, temozolamide, dasatanib, bevacizumab, taxanes, and vinorelbine.|$|R
5|$|Due to his {{casualty}} {{studies on}} mustard gas from an accident {{during the war}} in Italy, Rhoads became interested in its potential for cancer treatment. For the rest of his life, his research interest was in developing <b>chemotherapy</b> for cancer treatment, but he served primarily as an administrator and scientific director at Memorial and Sloan-Kettering. From studies of mustard gas, he developed a drug called mechlorethamine or Mustargen. Its success in clinical trials during the war years was the basis {{for the development of the}} field of anti-cancer <b>chemotherapy.</b> Rhoads also became interested in total body irradiation, which led to early work on <b>chemotherapy.</b>|$|E

30|$|Study {{strengths}} include (1) {{the availability}} of data from different insurers (2) inclusion of all, not just post-menopausal, breast cancer patients (3) consideration of age in determining off-label use, and (4) the investigation of all approved cancer therapies, not just <b>chemotherapies.</b>|$|R
50|$|The FDA {{approved}} Gefitinib in May 2003 for non-small cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC).It was approved as monotherapy {{for the treatment}} of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of both platinum-based and docetaxel <b>chemotherapies.</b> i.e. as a third-line therapy.|$|R
30|$|Using {{real-world}} data, {{we analyzed}} the actual treatments and costs for CRPC patients after docetaxel treatment. Our findings showed that 66.7  % {{of the study}} sample had been administered other <b>chemotherapies</b> after docetaxel. Although costs varied widely among the patients, our model estimated the mean health care costs to be ¥ 97, 506 ($ 952) per patient per month. Our estimate {{was similar to that}} of a previous study (Shibahara et al. 2014), which estimated costs to range from ¥ 53, 090 (US$ 518) to ¥ 91, 060 (US$ 889). In addition, our analysis showed that these costs were not strongly associated with death, but were significantly affected by variations in hospitalization and <b>chemotherapies.</b>|$|R
