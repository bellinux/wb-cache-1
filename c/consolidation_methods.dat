40|$|Abstract Background One {{method to}} {{understand}} and evaluate an experiment that produces a large set of genes, such as a gene expression microarray analysis, is to identify overrepresentation or enrichment for biological pathways. Because pathways are able to functionally describe the set of genes, much effort {{has been made to}} collect curated biological pathways into publicly accessible databases. When combining disparate databases, highly related or redundant pathways exist, making their consolidation into pathway concepts essential. This will facilitate unbiased, comprehensive yet streamlined analysis of experiments that result in large gene sets. Methods After gene set enrichment finds representative pathways for large gene sets, pathways are consolidated into representative pathway concepts. Three complementary, but different methods of pathway consolidation are explored. Enrichment Consolidation combines the set of the pathways enriched for the signature gene list through iterative combining of enriched pathways with other pathways with similar signature gene sets; Weighted Consolidation utilizes a Protein-Protein Interaction network based gene-weighting approach that finds clusters of both enriched and non-enriched pathways limited to the experiments' resultant gene list; and finally the de novo Consolidation method uses several measurements of pathway similarity, that finds static pathway clusters independent of any given experiment. Results We demonstrate that the three <b>consolidation</b> <b>methods</b> provide unified yet different functional insights of a resultant gene set derived from a genome-wide profiling experiment. Results from the methods are presented, demonstrating their applications in biological studies and comparing with a pathway web-based framework that also combines several pathway databases. Additionally a web-based consolidation framework that encompasses all three methods discussed in this paper, Pathway Distiller ([URL]), is established to allow researchers access to the methods and example microarray data described in this manuscript, and the ability to analyze their own gene list by using our unique <b>consolidation</b> <b>methods.</b> Conclusions By combining several pathway systems, implementing different, but complementary pathway <b>consolidation</b> <b>methods,</b> and providing a user-friendly web-accessible tool, we have enabled users the ability to extract functional explanations of their genome wide experiments. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} the key factors of the dynamic-static drainage <b>consolidation</b> <b>method</b> {{as it applies}} to a petroleum storage site that features very soft mud of strength as low as 8. 5 kPa. A field experiment was conducted to study the key factors on the success of this method such as effects of the number of tampings and the number of passes. The excess pore water pressures, settlements, field vane strengths were measured. Analysis of the results of measurements at the site leads to the conclusions that this method gives excellent results for strengthening the very soft mud. In addition, for a given total compaction energy, better result is obtained by increasing the number of passes with corresponding {{decrease in the number of}} tamping in each pass and limiting the compaction energy at a point for each pass to less than 1000 kN. m.
