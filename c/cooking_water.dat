Local Tibetan Buddhist religious leaders led a regional boycott movement that encouraged Tibetans to boycott Hui-owned shops, spreading the racist myth that Hui put the ashes of cremated imams in the <b>cooking</b> <b>water</b> they used to serve Tibetans food, in order to convert Tibetans to Islam.|$|E

25|$|Weightlessness {{can cause}} serious {{problems}} on technical instruments, especially those consisting of many mobile parts. Physical processes {{that depend on}} {{the weight of a}} body (like convection, <b>cooking</b> <b>water</b> or burning candles) act differently in free-fall. Cohesion and advection play a bigger role in space. Everyday work like washing or going to the bathroom are not possible without adaptation. To use toilets in space, like the one on the International Space Station, astronauts have to fasten themselves to the seat. A fan creates suction so that the waste is pushed away. Drinking is aided with a straw or from tubes.|$|E
25|$|Explorer was {{designed}} to be virtually fireproof and collision-proof. Of the materials used to construct her, 99.5 percent were fireproof, and Johns-Manville asbestos Flexboard paneling covered all of her interior spaces. She was built of heavy steel, and her hull plating and internal subdivision was almost twice that required for a ship of her class, greatly reducing her vulnerability to flooding {{in the event of a}} collision. Eight transverse bulkheads extending up to the main deck divided her into nine watertight compartments, and she {{was designed}} to withstand the flooding of two of the compartments without sinking; only three of the bulkheads were pierced by openings, and these could be sealed by closing electrically driven watertight doors operated from the bridge. To protect her hull from penetration by ice or rocks, Explorer had a double bottom and a 0.5-inch (12.7-mm) steel belt plate along her sides that extended six feet (1.8 meters) above and below the waterline. She was designed for six-month independent deployments, with the capability to service smaller vessels and shore stations. Explorer was equipped with a hospital, machine shop, electrical shop, carpenter shop, laundry, and marine garage. The accommodation for her crew and other embarked personnel were considered especially comfortable for the era. She could carry 99 tons of boiler water, 75 tons of drinking and <b>cooking</b> <b>water,</b> and 325 tons of fuel, giving her a cruising range of 7,000 nautical miles (8,056 statute miles; 12,964km) at a speed of 12 knots (13.8mph; 22.2km/hr).|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Enamel {{formation}} is a vulnerable developmental process, susceptible to environmental influences such as excessive systemic fluoride (F) exposure and infant/childhood disease. This study determined prevalence {{and extent of}} developmental enamel defects (DDE) and dental fluorosis in 8 -year-old Nigerians and explored associations with key predictors. Methods: A sample of 322 healthy 8 -year-olds (155 males, 167 females) from primary schools in lower and higher water F areas of; i) rural and ii) urban parts of Oyo State in south-west Nigeria (n= 4 areas) (in which the mean (SD) F concentration of community water supplies ranged from 0. 07 (0. 02) – 2. 13 (0. 64) mg F/L), were dentally examined using modified DDE (mDDE) and Thylstrup and Fejerskov (TF) indices. Drinking <b>waters,</b> <b>cooking</b> <b>waters</b> and toothpaste samples were analysed for F concentration using a F-Ion Selective Electrode (F-ISE). Information on infant/childhood diseases, infant feeding and tooth cleaning practices was obtained from parents/legal guardians. Data were analysed using ANOVA, Chi Square tests, Spearman correlation and binary logistic regression as appropriate. Results: Mean (SD) F concentration of actual drinking and actual <b>cooking</b> <b>waters</b> consumed by participants were 0. 25 (0. 20) and 0. 24 (0. 14) mg F/L respectively in the urban higher F area; 1. 11 (1. 00) and 1. 16 (1. 02) mg F/L respectively in the rural higher F area (p< 0. 05).

2500|$|Electric heating is {{a process}} in which {{electrical}} energy is converted to heat. Common applications include space heating, <b>cooking,</b> <b>water</b> heating and industrial processes. An electric heater is an electrical device that converts electric current to heat. The heating element inside every electric heater is an electrical resistor, and works on the principle of Joule heating: an electric current passing through a resistor will convert that electrical energy into heat energy. Most modern electric heating devices use nichrome wire as the active element; the heating element, depicted on the right, [...] uses nichrome wire supported by ceramic insulators.|$|E
2500|$|Another issue {{regarding}} {{environmental justice}} is lead poisoning. [...] If the fetus {{is exposed to}} lead during the pregnancy, this can result in learning difficulties and slowed growth. [...] A lot of paints (before 1978) and pipes contain lead. [...] Therefore, pregnant women who live in homes with lead paint will inhale the dust containing lead, leading to lead exposure in the fetus. [...] When lead pipes are used for drinking water and <b>cooking</b> <b>water,</b> this water is ingested, along with the lead, exposing the fetus to this toxin. [...] This issue is more prevalent in poorer communities. [...] This is because more well off families are {{able to afford to}} have their homes repainted and pipes renovated.|$|E
2500|$|Any form {{of cooking}} will destroy some {{nutrients}} in food, {{but the key}} variables are how much water {{is used in the}} cooking, how long the food is cooked, and at what temperature. Nutrients are primarily lost by leaching into <b>cooking</b> <b>water,</b> which tends to make microwave cooking healthier, given the shorter cooking times it requires. [...] Like other heating methods, microwaving converts vitamin B12 from an active to inactive form; the amount of conversion depends on the temperature reached, as well as the cooking time. Boiled food reaches a maximum of [...] (the boiling point of water), whereas microwaved food can get locally hotter than this, leading to faster breakdown of vitamin B12. The higher rate of loss is partially offset by the shorter cooking times required.|$|E
