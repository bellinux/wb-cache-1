Fourty eight Hereford and Angus stocker steers (average weight 259. 7 kg) were placed in twelve, five acre, pastures (four steers per pasture) planted with oat forage for a 91 d grazing trial to determine the effect of supplementing zinc methionine and <b>copper</b> <b>lysine</b> on performance and serum copper and zinc concentrations. Zinc methionine and <b>copper</b> <b>lysine</b> were provided in a 2 X 2 factorial arrangement of treatments in a free choice mineral supplement.

40|$|Copper {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} trace elements in ruminant nutrition. Its deficiency causes certain pathologies that can be cured by supplementation, by either five ("inorganic") or complexed ("chelated") forms. With the objective of being able to quantitatively compare the distribution of copper between the two forms of supplements, the speciation of copper in ruminant fluids was studied here. For this study, <b>copper</b> <b>lysine</b> supplement was used. It was necessary to first study the acid-base and complexation chemistry of <b>lysine</b> with <b>copper</b> (II). In addition, the complexation chemistry of glycine and histidine, were investigated. Mass balance equations were used to describe the distribution of copper (II) amongst different ligands. The results of the distribution of copper (II) ions in McDougall's solution (a simulated form of bovine saliva), indicate no significant differences in the distribution of copper using the different form of supplements. 1 H NMR was used to validate the results from the computer model. Using a combination of the results from the saliva simulation model and the chemical shifts from the NMR studies, the chemical shift changes that would accompany the addition of copper (II) to McDougall's solution were predicted. Results from the models do not show any appreciable differences from experimental values. Rumen samples were collected. Important peaks in the 1 H NMR spectrum were assigned. The spectrum indicated that acetic acid, resulting from the fermentation in the rumen, was a good probe for monitoring the speciation pattern. Speciation calculation indicated that the bulk of the copper would be bound to ammonia in the rumen. Changes in chemical shifts that result from the introduction of copper (II) to the rumen contents were predicted. Results were compared with experimental values. Agreement between the two sets of results was found to be satisfactory. The study shows that any advantages that result from the use of <b>copper</b> <b>lysine</b> supplement are not as a result of its remaining intact. Though metal bioavailabilities are hard to predict this approach could help better our understanding of this process. The methods developed here could be extended to other metal complexation problems in biological fluids. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

However, their role in the internalization of cationic gene delivery vectors such as liposomes, polymers, and peptides is still ambiguous and seems to be controlled by multiple factors. In this report, taking peptides as model systems, we show that peptide chemistry {{is one of the key}} factors that determine the dependence on cell surface glycosaminoglycans for cellular internalization and gene delivery. Arginine peptides and their complexes with plasmid DNA show efficient uptake and functional gene transfer independent of the cell surface GAGs. On the other hand, <b>lysine</b> peptides and <b>complexes</b> primarily enter through a GAG-dependent pathway. The peptide-DNA complexes also show differential interaction with soluble GAGs. In the presence of exogenous GAGs under certain conditions, arginine peptide-DNA complexes show increased transfection efficiency that is not observed with lysine. This is attributed to a change in the complex nature that ensures better protection of the compacted DNA in the case of arginine <b>complexes,</b> whereas the <b>lysine</b> <b>complexes</b> get destabilized under these conditions. The presence of a GAG coating also ensures better cell association of arginine complexes, resulting in increased uptake. Our results indicate that the role of both the cell surface and exogenous glycosaminoglycans in gene delivery is controlled by the nature of the peptide and its complex with DNA...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe role of cell {{surface and}} {{exogenous}} glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in DNA delivery by cationic peptides is controlled {{to a large}} extent by the peptide chemistry and the nature of its complex with DNA. We have previously shown that complexes formed by arginine homopeptides with DNA adopt a GAG-independent cellular internalization mechanism and show enhanced gene delivery in presence of exogenous GAGs. In contrast, <b>lysine</b> <b>complexes</b> gain cellular entry primarily by a GAG-dependent pathway and are destabilized by exogenous GAGs. The aim of the current study was to elucidate the factors governing the role of cell surface and soluble glycosaminoglycans in DNA delivery by sequences of arginine-rich peptides with altered arginine distributions (compared to homopeptide). Using peptides with clustered arginines which constitute known heparin-binding motifs and a control peptide with arginines alternating with alanines, we show that complexes formed by these peptides do not require cell surface GAGs for cellular uptake and DNA delivery. However, the charge distribution and the spacing of arginine residues affects DNA delivery efficiency of these peptides in presence of soluble GAGs, since these peptides show only a marginal increase in transfection in presence of exogenous GAGs unlike that observed with arginine homopeptides. Our results indicate that presence of arginine by itself drives these peptides to a cell surface GAG-independent route of entry to efficiently deliver functional DNA into cells in vitro. However, the inherent stability of the complexes differ when the distribution of arginines in the peptides is altered, thereby modulating its interaction with exogenous GAGs...|$|R

We have determined that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae <b>lysine</b> acetyltransferase <b>complex</b> NuA 4 is required for stress granule formation upon glucose deprivation but not heat stress. Further, the Tip 60 complex, the human homolog of the NuA 4 complex, is required for stress granule formation in cancer cell lines. Surprisingly, the impact of NuA 4 on glucose-deprived stress granule formation is partially mediated through regulation of acetyl-CoA levels, which are elevated in NuA 4 mutants. While elevated acetyl-CoA levels suppress the formation of glucose-deprived stress granules, decreased acetyl-CoA levels enhance stress granule formation upon glucose deprivation. Further our work suggests that NuA 4 regulates acetyl-CoA levels through the Acetyl-CoA carboxylase Acc 1. Altogether this work establishes both NuA 4 and the metabolite acetyl-CoA as critical signaling pathways regulating the formation of glucose-deprived stress granules...|$|R

40|$|SummaryPHF 20 is a core {{component}} of the <b>lysine</b> acetyltransferase <b>complex</b> MOF (male absent on the first) -NSL (non-specific lethal) that generates the major epigenetic mark H 4 K 16 ac and is necessary for transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. The role of PHF 20 in the complex remains elusive. Here, we report on functional coupling between methylation readers in PHF 20. We show that the plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of PHF 20 recognizes dimethylated lysine 4 of histone H 3 (H 3 K 4 me 2) and represents {{an example of a}} native reader that selects for this modification. Biochemical and structural analyses help to explain this selectivity and the preference of Tudor 2, another reader in PHF 20, for dimethylated p 53. Binding of the PHD finger to H 3 K 4 me 2 is required for histone acetylation, accumulation of PHF 20 at target genes, and transcriptional activation. Together, our findings establish a unique PHF 20 -mediated link between MOF histone acetyltransferase (HAT), p 53, and H 3 K 4 me 2, and suggest a model for rapid spreading of H 4 K 16 ac-enriched open chromatin...|$|R
40|$|Histone <b>lysine</b> methyltransferase <b>complexes</b> are {{essential}} for chromatin organization and gene regulation. Whether any of this machinery functions in membrane traffic is unknown. In this study, we report that mammal Dpy- 30 (mDpy- 30), a subunit of several histone H 3 lysine 4 (H 3 K 4) methyltransferase (H 3 K 4 MT) complexes, resides in the nucleus and at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The TGN targeting of mDpy- 30 is mediated by BIG 1, a TGN-localized guanine nucleotide exchange factor for adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor GTPases. Altering mDpy- 30 levels changes the distribution of cation-independent mannose 6 -phosphate receptor (CIMPR) without affecting that of TGN 46 or transferrin receptor. Our experiments also indicate that mDpy- 30 functions in the endosome to TGN transport of CIMPR and that its knockdown results in the enrichment of internalized CIMPR and recycling endosomes near cell protrusions. Much like mDpy- 30 depletion, the knockdown of Ash 2 L or RbBP 5, two other H 3 K 4 MT subunits, leads to a similar redistribution of CIMPR. Collectively, {{these results suggest that}} mDpy- 30 and probably H 3 K 4 MT {{play a role in the}} endosomal transport of specific cargo proteins...|$|R

40|$|Copper {{is one of}} {{the most}} vital trace {{elements}} in ruminant nutrition. It is required for several metabolic activities and it is also an essential component of several physiologically important metalloenzymes. Thus copper deficiency in ruminants results in distinctive pathologies, and hence in significant economic losses to farmers. Copper deficiency results from very low copper in diet (primary copper deficiency) and interference with Cu absorption in the animal due to Mo and S in food or water (secondary copper deficiency). The molybdenum-induced copper deficiency that affects ruminants can be attributed to the formation of thiomolybdates (TMs) from molybdate and sulfide in the rumen. The TMs formed then react irreversibly with copper to form insoluble Cu-TM complex which ultimately end up being excreted, thus reducing copper bioavailability to the ruminant. In this study, an attempt has been made to use computer simulations to model speciation of copper in rumen fluid in the presence of TMs with the aim of understanding the extent to which TMs affects the levels of copper in the rumen. This was done by initially refining the computer model of copper speciation with respect to low molecular mass (LMM) ligands in bovine rumen with the aim of correcting the discrepancy that was observed during experimental validation of the computer model in a previous study. To this end, mass balance equations which describes the distribution of Cu(II) amongst the different ligands were encoded into a spreadsheet to calculate equilibrium concentration of all species. Formation constants obtained from literature as well as those obtained from studies in our group were used as input values in the spreadsheet. Results show that at average ruminal pH, the metal would be present mostly as carbonate and phosphate complexes. The results obtained from the computer model in the present study were validated using 1 H NMR experiments on simulated rumen fluid as well as actual rumen fluid containing Cu(II); using acetic acid chemical shift as the probe for monitoring the speciation pattern. Excellent agreement was observed between the computer model and experimental results. Discrepancy was however observed upon introduction of <b>copper</b> <b>lysine</b> as <b>copper</b> source into the model. Incorporation of a mixed ligand complex of Cu(II), acetate and lysine into the computer model gave an excellent agreement between the computer model and experimental results. The study was extended to include glycine, histidine, methionine and EDTA complexes as the copper source in both rumen saliva (McDougall’s solution) and rumen fluid. Results show that only the histidine and EDTA complexes persist to any significant extent, in spite of the large number of competing ligands present in these matrices. In this study, success has also been achieved in the integration of the slow (kinetically controlled) formation of TMs and copper-tetrathiomolybdate (TM 4) complexation into the previously developed model for the rapidly equilibrating copper-ligand speciation. To simulate the formation of the TMs and Cu-TM 4 complex with respect to time, the differential equations representing rate expressions for each chemical species were solved to obtain an analytical solution using the Laplace transform method. The analytical solutions obtained were encoded in a spreadsheet and calculated as function of time to obtain time – dependent concentrations of TMs and Cu-TM 4 complex. This was then integrated with previously developed model for the rapidly equilibrating copper-ligand speciation in the rumen. The kinetic data used in the simulation of the formation thiomolybdates was obtained fron literature wheras that for Cu-TM 4 complexation was obtained from our lab using Cu(II) - Ion Selective Electrode. The results show that that in the presence of TM 4 the, Cu(II) bound to low molecular ligands in the rumen is drastically reduced confirming the effect TM 4 on Cu(II) observed in several in vitro studies. The study shows that in thiomolybdate contaminated rumen environment, the bioavailability of copper is considerably reduced. Though metal bioavailabilities are hard to predict this approach could help better our understanding of this process...|$|R

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, multiple {{studies have suggested that}} lysine acetylation has a role in coordinating phospholipid metabolism, yet its contribution towards phospholipid homeostasis remains uncharacterized. In this study we undertook a genetic screen to explore the connection between lysine acetylation and phospholipid homeostasis. We found that mutants of the <b>lysine</b> acetyltransferase <b>complex,</b> NuA 4, shared a negative genetic interaction with a mutant of Sec 14, a lipid-binding protein that regulates Golgi phospholipid composition. Through transcriptome, genetic, cell biology, and chemical analysis, we discovered that the growth defects between NuA 4 and Sec 14 mutants is likely derived from impaired fatty acid biosynthesis suggesting a role for NuA 4 as a positive regulator of fatty acid biosynthesis. Secondly, we discovered that acetylation on the conserved lysine residue K 109 inhibits the localization and function of the Oxysterol-Binding Protein Osh 4 - a lipid-binding protein that antagonizes the function of Sec 14 at the Golgi. Furthermore, regulation of Oxysterol-Binding Proteins by acetylation may be a conserved mechanism as we found that Osh 1, a homologue of Osh 4, was also acetylated on the equivalent lysine residue. Altogether, we have demonstrated that lysine acetylation can target multiple different phospholipid metabolic pathways which implies that it has a very important role for the regulation of phospholipid homeostasis...|$|R

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, multiple {{studies have suggested that}} the <b>lysine</b> acetyltransferase <b>complex</b> NuA 4 plays a role in phospholipid homeostasis. For one, NuA 4 mutants induce the expression of the inositol- 3 -phosphate synthase gene, INO 1, which leads to excessive accumulation of inositol, a key metabolite used for phospholipid biosynthesis. Additionally, NuA 4 mutants also display negative genetic interactions with sec 14 - 1 ts, a mutant of a lipid-binding gene responsible for phospholipid remodeling of the Golgi. Here, using a combination of genetics and transcriptional profiling, we explore the connections between NuA 4, inositol, and Sec 14. Surprisingly, we found that NuA 4 mutants did not suppress but rather exacerbated the growth defects of sec 14 - 1 ts under inositol-depleted conditions. Transcriptome studies reveal that while loss of the NuA 4 subunit EAF 1 in sec 14 - 1 ts does derepress INO 1 expression, it does not derepress all inositol/choline-responsive phospholipid genes, suggesting that the impact of Eaf 1 on phospholipid homeostasis extends beyond inositol biosynthesis. In fact, we find that NuA 4 mutants have impaired lipid droplet levels and through genetic and chemical approaches, we determine that the genetic interaction between sec 14 - 1 ts and NuA 4 mutants potentially reflects a role for NuA 4 in fatty acid biosynthesis. Altogether, our work identifies a new role for NuA 4 in phospholipid homeostasis...|$|R

Long-range oxidation of 8 -oxo-G within the MutY binding site using tethered rhodium intercalators promoted cross-linking and yielded information on MutY side chains that interact with this base.

40|$|NuA 4, {{the major}} H 4 <b>lysine</b> acetyltransferase (KAT) <b>complex</b> in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is {{recruited}} to promoters and stimulates transcription initiation. NuA 4 subunits contain domains that bind methylated histones, suggesting that histone methylation should target NuA 4 to coding sequences during transcription elongation. We show that NuA 4 is cotranscriptionally recruited, dependent on its physical association with elongating polymerase II (Pol II) phosphorylated on the C-terminal domain by cyclin-dependent kinase 7 /Kin 28, but independently of subunits (Eaf 1 and Tra 1) required for NuA 4 recruitment to promoters. Whereas histone methylation by Set 1 and Set 2 is dispensable for NuA 4 's interaction with Pol II and targeting to some coding regions, it stimulates NuA 4 -histone interaction and H 4 acetylation in vivo. The NuA 4 KAT, Esa 1, mediates increased H 4 acetylation and enhanced RSC occupancy and histone eviction in coding sequences and stimulates {{the rate of}} transcription elongation.

40|$|Protozoa in the phylum Apicomplexa are a {{large group}} of obligate {{intracellular}} parasites. Toxoplasma gondii and other apicomplexan parasites, such as Plasmodium falciparum, cause diseases by reiterating their lytic cycle, comprising host cell invasion, parasite replication, and parasite egress. The successful completion of the lytic cycle requires that the parasite senses changes in its environment and switches between the non-motile (for intracellular replication) and motile (for invasion and egress) states appropriately. Although the signaling pathway that regulates the motile state switch is critical to the pathogenesis of the diseases caused by these parasites, it is not well understood. Here we report a previously unknown mechanism of regulating the motility activation in Toxoplasma, mediated by a protein lysine methyltransferase, AKMT (for Apical <b>complex</b> <b>lysine</b> (K) methyltransferase). AKMT depletion greatly inhibits activation of motility, compromises parasite invasion and egress, and thus severely impairs the lytic cycle. Interestingly, AKMT redistributes from the apical complex to the parasite body rapidly in the presence of egress-stimulating signals that increase [Ca 2 +] in the parasite cytoplasm, suggesting that AKMT regulation of parasite motility might be accomplished by the precise temporal control of its localization in response to environmental changes...|$|R

Here, we studied the GAD CaM-binding domain in detail. A synthetic peptide of 26 amino acids corresponding to this domain forms a stable complex with Ca 2 +/CaM with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry, and amino acid substitutions suggest that tryptophan- 485 has an indispensable role in CaM binding. Chemical cross-linking revealed specific CaM/GAD interactions {{even in the absence}} of Ca 2 +. However, increasing KCI concentrations or deletion of two carboxy-terminal lysines abolished these interactions but had a mild effect on CaM/GAD interactions in the presence of Ca 2 +. We conclude that in the presence of Ca(2 +) -hydrophobic interactions involving tryptophan- 485 and electrostatic interactions involving the carboxy-terminal <b>lysines</b> mediate CaM/GAD <b>complex</b> formation. By contrast, in the absence of Ca 2 +, CaM/GAD interactions are essentially electrostatic and involve the carboxy-terminal lysines. In addition, a tryptophan residue and carboxy-terminal lysines are present in the CaM-binding domain of an Arabidopsis GAD.

Recent proteomic studies have revealed that as much as 10 % of prokaryotic and mammalian proteins undergo lysine acetylation, and as such, the study of its biological consequences is rapidly expanding to include virtually all cellular processes. Unravelling the complex regulatory network governed by lysine acetylation will require an in depth knowledge of the lysine acetyltransferase enzymes that mediate catalysis, and moreover the development of methods that can identify enzyme-substrate relationships in vivo. This is complex task and will be aided significantly through the use of model organisms and systems biology approaches. The work presented in this thesis explores the function of the highly conserved NuA 4 <b>lysine</b> acetyltransferase enzyme <b>complex</b> in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae using systems biology approaches. By exploiting genetic screening tools available to the budding yeast model, I have systematically assessed the cellular roles of NuA 4, thereby identifying novel cellular processes impacted by the function of the complex, such as vesicle-mediated transport and the stress response, and moreover identified specific pathways and proteins that are impacted by NuA 4 KAT activity, including cytokinesis through the regulation of septin protein dynamics. Moreover, I have developed a mass spectrometry-based technique to identify NuA 4 -dependent acetylation sites amongst proteins that physically interact with NuA 4 in vivo. Together this work demonstrates the diversity of processes impacted by NuA 4 function in vivo and moreover highlights the utility of global screening techniques to characterize KAT function...|$|R

Despite many advances in cancer research, chemotherapy regimens for osteosarcoma are still based on non-selective cytotoxic drugs. It is essential to investigate new specific molecular therapies for osteosarcoma to increase the survival rate of these patients. We performed exomic sequence analyses of 8 diagnostic biopsies of patients with conventional high grade osteosarcoma to advance our understanding of their genetic underpinnings and to correlate the genetic alteration with the clinical and pathological features of each patient to identify a personalized therapy. We identified 18, 275 somatic variations in 8, 247 genes and we found three mutated genes in 7 / 8 (87 %) samples (KIF 1 B, NEB and KMT 2 C). KMT 2 C showed the highest number of variations; it is an important component of a histone H 3 <b>lysine</b> 4 methyltransferase <b>complex</b> and {{it is one of the}} histone modifiers previously implicated in carcinogenesis, never studied in osteosarcoma. Moreover, we found a group of 15 genes that showed variations only in patients that did not respond to therapy and developed metastasis and some of these genes are involved in carcinogenesis and tumor progression in other tumors. These data could offer the opportunity to get a key molecular target to identify possible new strategies for early diagnosis and new therapeutic approaches for osteosarcoma and to provide a tailored treatment for each patient based on their genetic profile.

40|$|In ocular tissue, {{arachidonic acid}} is metabolized by {{cyclooxygenase}} to prostaglandins {{which are the}} most important lipid derived mediators of inflammation. Presently nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which are cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors are being used for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. NSAIDs used in ophthalmology, topically, are salicylic-, indole acetic-, aryl acetic-, aryl propionic- and enolic acid derivatives. NSAIDs are weak acids with pKa mostly between 3. 5 and 4. 5, and are poorly soluble in water. Aqueous ophthalmic solutions of NSAIDs have been made using sodium, potassium, tromethamine and <b>lysine</b> salts or <b>complexing</b> with cyclodextrins/solubilizer. Ocular penetration of NSAID demands an acidic ophthalmic solution where cyclodextrin could prevent precipitation of drug and minimize its ocular irritation potential. The incompatibility of NSAID with benzalkonium chloride is avoided by using polysorbate 80, cyclodextrins or tromethamine. Lysine salts and α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate disrupt corneal integrity, and their use requires caution. Thus a nonirritating ophthalmic solution of NSAID could be formulated by dissolving an appropriate water-soluble salt, in the presence of cyclodextrin or tromethamine (if needed) in mildly acidified purified water (if stability permits) with or without benzalkonium chloride and polyvinyl alcohol. Amide prodrugs met with mixed success due to incomplete intraocular hydrolysis. Suspension and ocular inserts appear irritating to the inflamed eye. Oil drop may be a suitable option for insoluble drugs and ointment may be used for sustained effect. Recent studies showed that the use of colloidal nanoparticle formulations and the potent COX 2 inhibitor bromfenac may enhance NSAID efficacy in eye preparations...|$|R
40|$|Upon {{the loss}} of glucose as the main carbon source cells have {{developed}} different mechanisms in order to adapt to this stress and promote survival. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae one such mechanism is acetylation, a post-translational modification performed by a <b>lysine</b> acetyltransferase (KAT) <b>complex,</b> such as NuA 4, which has been previously shown to regulate different glucose metabolic pathways. Despite its known role upon glucose starvation, it is not currently understood how NuA 4 itself is regulated in response to acute glucose deprivation (GD). I determine here that NuA 4 complex protein levels (including catalytic protein Esa 1), structure, activity, and localization are not impacted by acute GD. Despite GD showing no impact to NuA 4 itself, it does result in the remodelling of both the interactome and acetylome of the complex where 160 proteins were identified to change interaction with Esa 1 -TAP and 93 acetylation sites were identified. As well GD results in a shift in localization of interacting proteins from nuclear upon standard growth to cytoplasmic. As well the changing interactome shows enrichment for proteins related to regulation of transcription and translation, metabolic pathways like glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, and others related to the cellular stress response. From the interactome three sets of proteins, Pab 1, Eaf 5 / 7 / 3, and Fas 1 and Fas 2, were studied further to greater characterize their interaction with NuA 4 as they change interaction upon GD. Eaf 7 protein levels were shown to decrease upon GD and both Fas 1 and Fas 2 levels were shown to increase in response to NuA 4 deletion mutants. Together this work provides {{a greater understanding of}} the cellular response to acute GD stress, and how NuA 4 plays a role in response to that stress in order to promote cell survival...|$|R
40|$|RNase {{inhibitor}} (RI) binds diverse {{proteins in}} the pancreatic RNase superfamily with extremely high avidity. Previous {{studies showed that}} tight binding of RNase A and angiogenin (Ang) is achieved primarily through interactions of hot spot residues in the 434 - 460 C-terminal segment of RI with the enzymatic active site; Asp 435 of RI forms key hydrogen bonds with the catalytic <b>lysine</b> in both <b>complexes,</b> whereas the other contacts are largely distinctive. Here we have investigated the structural basis for recognition of a third ligand, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), by single-site and multisite mutagenesis. Surprisingly, Ala replacement of Asp 435 decreases affinity for EDN only by 14 -fold, {{as compared to the}} several hundred-fold decreases with RNase A and Ang, and individual mutations of three other hot spot residues - Tyr 434, Tyr 437, and Ser 460 - have essentially no effect. Ala substitutions of nine additional residues, selected by examining a computational model of the RI-EDN complex, also have no marked impact. Overall, the losses in affinity for the single-residue variants examined account for only ∼ 25 % of the free energy of binding for the complex. However, multisite mutagenesis of RI reveals strong superadditivity of mutational effects, indicating that part of this shortfall reflects negative cooperativity. Replacement of Tyr 434 together with Asp 435 or Tyr 437 increases Ki by 540 - and 290 -fold, respectively. Thus, the C-terminal region of RI again {{plays an important role in}} ligand recognition, although probably smaller than for binding RNase A and Ang. Simultaneous substitutions of three neighboring tryptophans (261, 263, and 318) on RI attenuate affinity even more dramatically (by 4900 -fold), indicating that the interactions of this RI region also contribute a considerable amount of the binding energy for the EDN complex. These findings highlight the potential importance of cooperativity in protein - protein interactions and the consequent limitations of single-site mutagenesis for assessing interface energetics. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{death is}} {{prevalent}} in animal development, homeostasis, and disease. While apoptotic cell death {{has been extensively}} studied, many dying cells in development do not exhibit apoptotic morphology, and mice lacking core apoptotic regulators have mostly normal rates of developmental programmed cell death. However, {{little is known about}} how alternative death programs are set in motion. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, most cells fated to die by apoptosis are eliminated as young, undifferentiated cells, for no obvious functional reasons. The male nematode’s linker cell, in contrast, dies as an older, differentiated cell, whose life and death subserve precise and important functions. The linker cell first undertakes a long migration along a characteristic path, elongating the male gonad into its proper, mature shape. Once the gonad has attained its final shape and the linker cell has completed its migration, the linker cell then dies to connect the gonad to the environment and allow male fertility. Linker cell death is genetically and morphologically non-apoptotic. Instead, this death program requires the temporal regulator LIN- 29, the SARM-like protein TIR- 1, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) SEK- 1, and the glutamine-rich protein PQN- 41. SARM and MAPKKs have been implicated in non-apoptotic degeneration of axon distal segments following axotomy, and some developmental and pathological cell death events in vertebrates resemble the morphology of the dying linker cell. Thus, the molecular mechanism governing linker cell death may be conserved; however, neither the initiating death signals nor the target/s of linker cell death regulators are known. Using classical genetics, I have investigated the initiating mechanisms of linker cell death. I have characterized the cell-autonomous involvement of a histone 3, <b>lysine</b> 4 methyltransferase <b>complex</b> centered on the Trithorax/MLL-like catalytic subunit SET- 16. I then demonstrated that two opposing spatial cues, the Wnt ligands EGL- 20 and LIN- 44, cooperate with LIN- 29 to control linker cell death initiation. I showed that the Abdominal- B-like Hox transcription factor NOB- 1 likely acts upstream of these two Wnt pathways, and that the Tailless/Tlx nuclear hormone receptor NHR- 67 acts in parallel to these regulators to promote linker cell death in addition to linker cell migration. Finally, I show that the Wnt pathways and all known linker cell death mediators require the heat shock factor HSF- 1 for cell death. Importantly, HSF- 1 function in linker cell death is distinct from, and competes with, its role in stress responses. My studies demonstrate that HSF- 1, previously thought to be primarily protective, is a key downstream regulator of a nonapoptotic cell death program. I have also developed a method to isolate large numbers of linker cells from staged worms populations, to enable a comprehensive characterization of the transcriptional program driving linker cell death...|$|R
40|$|This project {{focused on}} a {{molecular}} and biochemical characterization of the protein methyltransferases responsible for methylation of the LS and SS in Rubisco, and the associated functional consequences accompanying these modifications. Our results provided {{some of the most}} informative structural and mechanistic understandings of SET domain protein methyltransferases. These results also positioned us to provide the first unambiguous assignment of the kinetic reaction mechanism for SET-domain protein methyltransferases, and to design and engineer an alternative substrate for Rubisco LSMT, enabling substrate specificity and functional significance studies. We demonstrated that the minimal substrate recognized by Rubisco LSMT is free lysine as well as monomethyllysine, an observation corroborated both by structural analyses as well as enzymatic activity and subsequent product distribution analyses. Ternary complexes between Rubisco LSMT and free <b>lysine</b> compared to <b>complexes</b> with monomethyllysine demonstrated that the structural basis for multiple methyl group additions is a consequence of hydrogen-bond driven spatial shifts in the amino group of Lys- 14, which maintains the direct in-line geometry necessary for SN 2 nucleophilic attack. The structural observations are also consistent with the previous proposal that the multiplicity of methyl group additions takes place through a processive mechanism, with successive methyl group additions to an enzyme protein complex which does not disassociate prior to the formation of trimethyllysine. This mechanism has important implications, since the regulation of gene expression by SET domain histone methyltransferases is not only dependent on site-specific lysine methylation, but also the degree of methylation. We examined the kinetic reaction mechanism for three different types of SET domain protein methyltransferases, each under conditions supporting mono-, di-, or trimethyllysine formation corroborated by product analyses. Additionally, the tight initial binding of Rubisco LSMT to Rubisco also allowed us to design a novel immobilized complex between Rubisco and Rubisco LSMT, which allowed for an unambiguous demonstration of the requirement for trimethyllysine formation prior to disassociation of the Rubisco LSMT:Rubisco complex, and therefore proof of the processive mechanism for methyl group transfer. These kinetic studies also demonstrated that an important factor has been overlooked in all kinetic analyses of SET domain protein methyltransferases reported to date. This factor is the influence of the low turnover number for SET domain protein methyltransferases and how, relative to the time-frame of kinetic enzyme assays, this can generate changes in kinetic profiles shifting reciprocal plot patterns from random/ordered bi-bi to the real kinetic reaction mechanism plots of ping-pong. Although the ternary complexes of Rubisco LSMT with S-Adenosylhomocysteine and lysine and monomethyllysine were informative in regard to reaction mechanism, they were not helpful in identifying the mechanism used by Rubisco LSMT for determining substrate specificity. We were unsuccessful at obtaining ternary complexes of Rubisco LSMT with bound synthetic polypeptide substrates, as has been reported for several histone methyltransferases. However, we were able to model a polypeptide sequence corresponding to the N-terminal region of the LS of Rubisco into the apparent substrate binding cleft in Rubisco LSMT. Knowledge of the determinants of polypeptide substrate specificity are important for identifying possible alternate substrates, as well as the possibility of generating more desirable substrates amenable to site-directed mutagenesis experiments unlike Rubisco. We determined that Rubisco LSMT is capable of methylating synthetic polypeptide mimics of the N-terminal region of the LS, both free as well as conjugated to keyhole limpet hemacyanin, but with considerable less efficiency than intact holoenzyme...|$|R
40|$|Transcriptional {{elongation}} is {{a crucial}} step in eukaryotic gene regulation whose mis-regulation leads to cellular pathologies. This makes it quite imperative to aim for {{a better understanding of}} the processes regulating transcriptional elongation. An important process promoting the association of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) with the coding region of the active gene and hence transcriptional elongation is the monoubiquitination of histone H 2 B at <b>lysine</b> 123. A <b>complex</b> of an E 2 conjugase, Rad 6 p, and an E 3 ligase, Bre 1 p, is essential for this process. Consistent with the role of histone H 2 B monoubiquitination in promoting the association of RNAPII with the active gene, this process was found to be impaired in the absence of Rad 6 p or point mutation of lysine 123 to arginine (H 2 B-K 123 R). Intriguingly, the association of RNAPII with the coding region of the active gene was not impaired in the absence of Bre 1 p, even though Bre 1 p is essential for histone H 2 B monoubiquitination. However, deletion of Bre 1 p’s RING domain that is essential for histone H 2 B monoubiquitination led to an impaired RNAPII association with the active gene. This observation indicates a role of the non-RING domain of Bre 1 p in repressing the association of RNAPII with the active gene, resulting in no net decrease in RNAPII occupancy in the absence of Bre 1 p. Taken together, my results implicated both the stimulatory and repressive roles of the histone H 2 B ubiquitin ligase Bre 1 p in regulation of RNAPII association with the coding regions of active genes and hence transcriptional elongation. Interestingly, my work also revealed that for efficient transcriptional elongation by histone H 2 B monoubiquitination, its optimum level needs to be maintained by a proper balance between Rad 6 p-Bre 1 p-mediated ubiquitination and de-ubiquitination (DUB) by the DUB module of SAGA. It was found that Sus 1 p, a subunit of the DUB module, promotes transcriptional elongation, DNA repair and replication via regulation of histone H 2 B DUB. In addition to Rad 6 p- Bre 1 p and the DUB module, global level of histone H 2 B monoubiquitination is also critically regulated by Cdk 9, a kinase essential for phosphorylation of the serine 2 residue in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII, which promotes transcriptional elongation. Apart from serine phosphorylation, proline residues at RNAPII-CTD undergo isomerization by proline isomerases, which also regulate transcription. One of the proline isomerases, Rrd 1 p, has been previously implicated in transcription in response to rapamycin treatment. Based on this fact and Rrd 1 p’s known interaction with RNAPII-CTD, we predicted that Rrd 1 p might regulate transcription independently of rapamycin treatment. In agreement with this hypothesis, our work revealed Rrd 1 p’s role in facilitating transcription of both rapamycin responsive and non-responsive genes in the absence of rapamycin treatment. Consistently, the absence of Rrd 1 p led to an impaired nucleosomal disassembly at the active gene, which correlates with the role of Rrd 1 p in promoting transcription. This is because maintenance of proper nucleosomal dynamics is essential for efficient transcription. It is known that transcriptional elongation is facilitated by the regulation of nucleosomal dynamics via the histone chaperone, FACT. Efficient chromatin reassembly in the wake of elongating RNAPII contributing to the fidelity of transcription is promoted by FACT. Being evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotes, FACT is also known to regulate DNA replication and repair, apart from transcription. Intriguingly, FACT has been found to be upregulated in cancers while its downregulation leads to tumor cell death. However, the mechanism which fine-tunes FACT for normal cellular functions remained unknown. My studies revealed a novel mechanism of regulation of FACT by the ubiquitin-proteasome system in yeast. San 1 p, an E 3 ligase involved in nuclear protein quality control, was found to associate with the active gene and regulate transcriptional elongation through its E 3 ligase activity- mediated turnover of Spt 16 p component of FACT. This regulation was found to maintain optimum level of Spt 16 p/FACT to engage with the active gene for proper transcriptional elongation, DNA repair and replication. In spite of playing such crucial roles in gene regulation, it was not known how FACT is targeted to the active gene. We discovered that a direct physical interaction between FACT and Cet 1 p, the mRNA capping enzyme, targets FACT to the active gene independently of Cet 1 p’s mRNA capping activity. Such targeting of FACT to the active gene leads to the release of promoter proximally paused-RNAPII into transcriptional elongation. However, the progress of RNAPII along the active gene during transcriptional elongation is frequently impeded by various kinds of damages along the underlying template DNA. Even though some of these lesions are co-transcriptionally repaired, it was not known whether the repair of extremely toxic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) was coupled to transcription. My results showed that DSBs at the transcriptionally active state of a gene are repaired faster than at the inactive state but such repair was not mediated by a co-transcriptional recruitment of DSB repair factors. This observation is in contrast to other DNA repair pathways such as nucleotide excision repair (NER) where repair factors are co-transcriptionally recruited to the lesion containing DNA. In this regard, we found that an NER factor, Rad 14 p, co-transcriptionally associates with the active gene in the absence of DNA damage to promote transcription, which unraveled a new role of Rad 14 p in transcription in addition its established role in NER. In summary, my results provide significant novel insights into the regulation of transcriptional elongation and associated processes leading to better understanding of eukaryotic gene expression...|$|R
