In the next parts, models of <b>cartel</b> <b>agreements</b> and Leniency Programme including the prisoner's dilemma model are presented.

The thesis should also involve formation and development of the programme and how it is influenced by European law. The thesis is divided into 4 parts. The first part deals with <b>cartel</b> <b>agreements.</b> The second part focuses on cartel law enforcement which is divided in term of law regulation into public and private enforcement. The third part is the core of the theoretical part of the thesis, it presents in detail the regulation of the Leniency programme within the European Union and in the Czech Republic, there are problems of the program and their possible solutions outlined as well.

In such a situation partial agreements [...] for instance, founding a common marketing board [...] seem more likely than detailed <b>cartel</b> <b>agreements.</b> In this paper we analyze the economic institution of a common buffer stock agency which can shift supply from present to future periods. Although the buffer stock agency determines the prices, individual production amounts are chosen independently by the sellers. We study {{the case of a}} price buffer stock agency which cannot produce, as well as the situation in which a major seller controls the buffer stock. One interesting result is that it makes quite an important difference whether the buffer stock agency is or is not able to produce.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{competition}} law of the European Union, namely with the private consequences of <b>cartel</b> <b>agreements</b> (as defined in Article 101, paragraph 1, TFEU) and with their enforcement. It understands its subject widely and therefore it is not concerned only with private consequences and their enforcement but it also analyses the nature of prohibition and voidness of such agreements {{on the basis of}} a causal relationship between these legal concepts and respective consequences. Furthermore, it describes the private enforcement of EU competition law (which is legal instrument to enforce claims that emerge from private law consequences) not only from the perspective of its topic but also in terms of its relationship to the public enforcement. It also {{deals with the}} interaction between these enforcement systems. Chapter 2 of the thesis provides a basic introduction to the topic of <b>cartel</b> <b>agreements</b> governed by the EU law. It describes prohibition of these agreements under Article 101 paragraph 1 TFEU and deals with their voidness under paragraph 2 ibid. It concentrates on the later because of the considerable uncertainties about its nature in terms of interpretation of its legislation, absoluteness and possibility to severe void provisions from the rest.

Among the steel bridges constructed by K. Rudzki were Warsaw's Poniatowski Bridge, but also most of Trans-Siberian Railway's river crossings, including the 1916 Khabarovsk Bridge (at over 2,500 metres of length for decades the longest bridge in Eurasia). The company also built bridges for the Orenburg-Tashkent Railway, Saint Petersburg - Warsaw Railway, Amur Railway (all bridges on the eastern and middle sections of the line), Ussuri Railway and Chinese Eastern Railway, among others. The company was also one of principal contractors during the construction of St. Peter and St. Paul's Church in Warsaw (now St. Barbara's Church in Warsaw) (1894) and Hale Mirowskie (1899-1901), it also continued to produce machinery for railway companies, overhead cranes, elevators, artillery, boilers, centrifugal pumps, water turbines and many other types of machinery. It was also one of principal military contractors, producing artillery shells (since 1905), shrapnel ammunition (since 1909) and airship hangars (1914). Between 1893 and 1914 the equity of the company rose by a factor of 6, from 600,000 roubles to over 4 million. Total sale value for 1914 amounted to 11.6 million rubles.|$|E

40|$|Contrary to {{conventional}} wisdom, this article argues that trade liberalization may facilitate collusion and reduce welfare. With {{the help of}} a duopoly model in which firms interact repeatedly in multiple markets, we first show that, if trade costs (i. e., tariffs/transport costs) and discount factors are not too high, efficient <b>cartel</b> <b>agreements</b> necessitate the cross-hauling of goods, as that entails lower deviation incentives. In this setting, we then demonstrate that reciprocal trade liberalization always raises total output when trade costs are within a range whose lower bound exceeds a threshold level, but may reduce total output (and thus be pro-collusive) when trade costs are below that threshold level.

50|$|In general, <b>cartel</b> <b>agreements</b> are {{economically}} unstable in {{that there}} is an incentive for members to cheat by selling at below the agreed price or selling more than the production quotas set by the cartel (see also game theory). This has caused many cartels that attempt to set product prices to be unsuccessful in the long term. Empirical studies of 20th century cartels have determined that the mean duration of discovered cartels is from 5 to 8 years. However, once a cartel is broken, the incentives to form the cartel return and the cartel may be re-formed. Publicly-known cartels that do not follow this cycle include, by some accounts, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).|$|R
40|$|The diploma thesis {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} the effect of the introduction of leniency program and its reforms on the European competition policy and above all of its effect on investigation of forbidden <b>cartel</b> <b>agreements.</b> Leniency program is currently one of the main tools being implemented in fighting cartels. It works by providing immunity to the first company that provides relevant proof of the cartels existence. This work has three main goals. Firstly it aims to analyse the effectiveness of the leniency program and its reforms when it comes to uncovering cartels. The second goal is to unveil the European Commissions strategy concerning granting leniency and its development over the time. The last goal is to provide a quality analysis of all three forms of leniency and their mutual comparison. This diploma thesis is divided into four chapters: two theoretical and two practical chapters. The first one explains the issue of <b>cartel</b> <b>agreements,</b> individual types of cartels, investigation and its methods and the principals of imposing fines. The analysis of the leniency program itself, its introduction in 1996 and the following reforms in 2002 and 2006 will be the main topics of the second chapter. The third chapter contains the analysis of all Commissions decisions against cartels from 1993 till April 2016. It contains data relating to the development of number of decisions, the amount of fines, the size of the cartels and the percentage of the leniency granted in this period. The forth and the last chapter will focus on a case study of the LCD cartel and on the basis of theoretical findings contained in the first two chapters it will uncover the principles of this particular cartel and the investigation procedures...|$|R
