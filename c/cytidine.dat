25|$|Pyrimidine ribonucleosides {{and their}} {{respective}} nucleotides have been prebiotically synthesized by a sequence of reactions which by-pass the free sugars, and are assembled in a stepwise fashion by using nitrogenous or oxygenous chemistries. Sutherland has demonstrated high yielding routes to <b>cytidine</b> and uridine ribonucleotides built from small 2 and 3 carbon fragments such as glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, cyanamide and cyanoacetylene. One of the steps in this sequence allows the isolation of enantiopure ribose aminooxazoline if the enantiomeric excess of glyceraldehyde is 60% or greater. This {{can be viewed as}} a prebiotic purification step, where the said compound spontaneously crystallized out from a mixture of the other pentose aminooxazolines. Ribose aminooxazoline can then react with cyanoacetylene in a mild and highly efficient manner to give the alpha <b>cytidine</b> ribonucleotide. Photoanomerization with UV light allows for inversion about the 1' anomeric centre to give the correct beta stereochemistry. In 2009 they showed that the same simple building blocks allow access, via phosphate controlled nucleobase elaboration, to 2',3'-cyclic pyrimidine nucleotides directly, which are known to be able to polymerize into RNA. This paper also highlights the possibility for the photo-sanitization of the pyrimidine-2',3'-cyclic phosphates.|$|E

From the mass difference between the PCR products generated with unlabeled nucleosides and products containing 13 C/ 15 N-labeled nucleosides, we determined the base composition of the genomic regions of interest. Two approaches were used to verify the target regions: The first approach used nucleosides partially enriched with stable isotopes to identify a single uncalled base in a gel electrophoresis-sequenced region. The second approach used mass tags with 100 % heavy nucleosides to examine a GC-rich region of a polycytidine string with {{an unknown number of}} <b>cytidines.</b> By use of selected 13 C/ 15 N-labeled dNTPs (dCTPs) in PCR amplification of the target region in tandem with MALDI-TOF-MS, we determined precisely that this string contains 11 <b>cytidines.</b> Both approaches show the ability of our MS-based mass-tagging strategy to solve critical questions of sequence identities that might be essential in determining the proper reading frames of the targeted regions...|$|R
40|$|Bacteria evolved {{restriction}} endonucleases {{to prevent}} interspecies DNA transmission and bacteriophage infection. Here, {{we show that}} human cells possess an analogous mechanism. APOBEC 3 A is induced by interferon following DNA detection, and it deaminates foreign double-stranded DNA <b>cytidines</b> to uridines. These atypical DNA nucleosides are converted by the uracil DNA glycosylase UNG 2 to abasic lesions, which lead to foreign DNA degradation. This mechanism is evident in cell lines and primary monocytes, where up to 97 % of <b>cytidines</b> in foreign DNA are deaminated. In contrast, cellular genomic DNA appears unaffected. Several other APOBEC 3 s also restrict foreign gene transfer. Related proteins exist in all vertebrates, indicating that foreign DNA restriction may be a conserved innate immune defense mechanism.

25|$|The {{generation}} of TCR diversity {{is similar to}} that for antibodies and B cell antigen receptors. It arises mainly from genetic recombination of the DNA encoded segments in individual somatic T cells by somatic V(D)J recombination using RAG1 and RAG2 recombinases. Unlike immunoglobulins, however, TCR genes do not undergo somatic hypermutation, and T cells do not express Activation-Induced (<b>Cytidine)</b> Deaminase (AID). The recombination process that creates diversity in BCR (antibodies) and TCR is unique to lymphocytes (T and B cells) during the early stages of their development in primary lymphoid organs (thymus for T cells, bone marrow for B cells).|$|E
25|$|Regulation of RNR is {{designed}} to maintain balanced quantities of dNTPs. Binding of effector molecules either increases or decreases RNR activity. When ATP binds to the allosteric activity site, it activates RNR. In contrast, when dATP binds to this site, it deactivates RNR. In addition to controlling activity, the allosteric mechanism also regulates the substrate specificity and ensures the enzyme produces {{an equal amount of}} each dNTP for DNA synthesis. In all classes, binding of ATP or dATP to the allosteric site induces reduction of <b>cytidine</b> 5’-diphosphate (CDP) and uridine 5’-diphosphate (UDP); 2’-deoxyguanosine 5’-triphosphate (dGTP) induces reduction of adenosine 5’-diphosphate (ADP); and 2’-deoxythymidine 5’-triphosphate (dTTP) induces reduction of guanosine 5’-diphosphate (GDP) (Figure 1).|$|E

The Sec {{insertion}} sequence (SECIS) element, {{which is the}} stem-loop structure present in 3 " untranslated regions (UTRs) of eukaryotic selenoprotein-encoding genes, is essential for recognition of UGA as a codon for Sec {{rather than as a}} stop signal. We now report the identification of a new eukaryotic selenoprotein, designated selenoprotein M (SelM). The 3 -kb human SelM-encoding gene has five exons and is located on chromosome 22 but has not been correctly identified by either Celera or the public Human Genome Project. We characterized human and mouse SelM cDNA sequences and expressed the selenoprotein in various mammalian cell lines. The 3 " UTR of the human, mouse, and rat SelM-encoding genes lacks a canonical SECIS element. Instead, Sec is incorporated in response to a conserved mRNA structure, in which <b>cytidines</b> are present in place of the adenosines previously considered invariant. Substitution of adenosines for <b>cytidines</b> did not alter Sec incorporation; however, other mutant structures did not support selenoprotein synthesis, demonstrating that this new form of SECIS element is functional. SelM is expressed in a variety of tissues, with increased levels in the brain.

40|$|Abstract Background In plants, RNA editing is {{a process}} that {{converts}} specific <b>cytidines</b> to uridines and uridines to <b>cytidines</b> in transcripts from virtually all mitochondrial protein-coding genes. There are thousands of plant mitochondrial genes in the sequence databases, but sites of RNA editing have not been determined for most. Accurate methods of RNA editing site prediction will be important in filling in this information gap and could reduce or even eliminate the need for experimental determination of editing sites for many sequences. Because RNA editing tends to increase protein conservation across species by "correcting" codons that specify unconserved amino acids, this principle can be used to predict editing sites by identifying positions where an RNA editing event would increase the conservation of a protein to homologues from other plants. PREP-Mt takes this approach to predict editing sites for any protein-coding gene in plant mitochondria. Results To test the general applicability of the PREP-Mt methodology, RNA editing sites were predicted for 370 full-length or nearly full-length DNA sequences and then compared to the known sites of RNA editing for these sequences. Of 60, 263 <b>cytidines</b> in this test set, PREP-Mt correctly classified 58, 994 as either an edited or unedited site (accuracy = 97. 9 %). PREP-Mt properly identified 3, 038 of the 3, 698 known sites of RNA editing (sensitivity = 82. 2 %) and 55, 956 of the 56, 565 known unedited sites (specificity = 98. 9 %). Accuracy and sensitivity increased to 98. 7 % and 94. 7 %, respectively, after excluding the 489 silent editing sites (which have no effect on protein sequence or function) from the test set. Conclusion These results indicate that PREP-Mt is effective at identifying C to U RNA editing sites in plant mitochondrial protein-coding genes. Thus, PREP-Mt should be useful in predicting protein sequences for use in molecular, biochemical, and phylogenetic analyses. In addition, PREP-Mt could be used to determine functionality of a mitochondrial gene or to identify particular sequences with unusual editing properties. The PREP-Mt methodology should be applicable to any system where RNA editing increases protein conservation across species. </p...|$|R

40|$|Apolipoprotein (apo) B mRNA editing is the deamination of C(6666) to uridine, {{which results}} in {{translation}} of the apoB- 48 protein instead of the genomically encoded apoB- 100. ApoB- 48 -containing lipoproteins are cleared more rapidly from plasma and are less atherogenic than apoB- 100 -containing low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). In humans, the intestine predominantly produces apoB- 48 whereas the liver secretes apoB- 100 only. To evaluate a potential therapeutic use for liver-induced apoB mRNA editing in humans, we investigated the efficiency and safety of transgenic expression of apoB mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide 1 (APOBEC- 1) {{in the absence of}} endogenous editing in the mouse model. Here we show that regulatable tetO-mediated APOBEC- 1 expression in the livers of gene-targeted mice lacking endogenous APOBEC- 1 results in 30 % apoB mRNA editing.

H. pylori strain 26695, whose genomic sequence was determined by The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR), contains a repeat of nine <b>cytidines</b> in the fliP flagellar basal body gene that splits the open reading frame in two parts. In this work, we demonstrate that the 26695 C 9 strain with a split fliP gene as sequenced by TIGR was nonflagellated and nonmotile. In contrast, earlier isolates of strain 26695 selected by positive motility testing as well as pig-passaged derivatives of 26695 were all flagellated and highly motile. All of these motile strains had a C 8 repeat and consequently a contiguous fliP reading frame. By screening approximately 50, 000 colonies of 26695 C 9 for motility in soft agar, a motile revertant with a C 8 repeat could be isolated, proving that the described switch is reversible. The fliP genes of 20 motile clinical H. pylori isolates from different geographic regions possessed intact fliP genes with repeats of eight <b>cytidines</b> or the sequence CCCCACCC in its place.
