5|$|All battleships are top {{heavy and}} tend to settle upside down when they sink. Arkansas settled upside down, but a 1989 diver's sketch of the wreck shows hardly any of the {{starboard}} side of the hull, making it look like the ship is lying on her side. Most of the starboard side is present, but severely <b>compacted.</b>|$|E
30|$|Firstly, we {{note that}} any finite subset of R is I-ward <b>compact,</b> the union of two I-ward <b>compact</b> subsets of R is I-ward <b>compact,</b> and the {{intersection}} of any I-ward <b>compact</b> subsets of R is I-ward <b>compact.</b> Furthermore, any subset of an I-ward <b>compact</b> set is I-ward <b>compact,</b> and any bounded subset of R is I-ward <b>compact.</b> Any <b>compact</b> subset of R is also I-ward <b>compact,</b> and the set N is not I-ward <b>compact.</b> We note that any slowly oscillating <b>compact</b> subset of R is I-ward <b>compact</b> (see [6] for the definition of slowly oscillating compactness). These observations suggest {{that we have the}} following result.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that each locally <b>compact</b> {{strongly}} sober topology is contained in a <b>compact</b> Hausdorff topology; just take the supremum of its topology with its dual topology. On the other hand, examples of <b>compact</b> topologies are known that do not have a finer <b>compact</b> Hausdorff topology. This led to the question (first explicitly formulated by D. E. Cameron) whether each <b>compact</b> topology is contained in a <b>compact</b> topology with respect to which all <b>compact</b> sets are closed. (For the obvious reason these spaces are called maximal <b>compact</b> in the literature.) While this major problem remains open, we present several partial solutions to the question in our talk. For instance we show that each <b>compact</b> topology is contained in a <b>compact</b> topology with respect to which convergent sequences have unique limits. In fact each <b>compact</b> topology is contained in a <b>compact</b> topology with respect to which countable <b>compact</b> sets are closed. Furthermore we note that each <b>compact</b> sober T_ 1 -topology is contained in a maximal <b>compact</b> topology and that each sober <b>compact</b> T_ 1 -topology which is locally <b>compact</b> or sequential is the infimum of a family of maximal <b>compact</b> topologies...|$|R
40|$|We {{revisit the}} known problem whether each <b>compact</b> {{topology}} {{is contained in}} a maximal <b>compact</b> topology and collect some partial answers to this question. For instance we show that each <b>compact</b> topology is contained in a <b>compact</b> topology in which convergent sequences have unique limits. We also answer a question of D. E. Cameron by showing that each sequentially <b>compact</b> topology is contained in a maximal sequentially <b>compact</b> topology. We finally observe that each sober <b>compact</b> T_ 1 -topology is contained in a maximal <b>compact</b> topology and that each sober <b>compact</b> T_ 1 -topology which is locally <b>compact</b> or sequential is the infimum {{of a family of}} maximal <b>compact</b> topologies...|$|R
5|$|Earth usually {{requires}} {{some sort of}} processing for use in construction. It may be combined with water to make mud, straw may be added, some form of stabilizing material such as lime or cement {{may be used to}} harden the earth, and the earth may be <b>compacted</b> to increase strength.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies are}} {{commonly}} parasitized by the ascomycete Hypomyces lactifluorum, transforming {{them into an}} edible known as a lobster mushroom. In this form, {{the surface of the}} fruit body develops into a hard, thin crust dotted with minute pimples, and the gills are reduced to blunt ridges. The flesh of the mushroom—normally brittle and crumbly—becomes <b>compacted</b> and less breakable.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} bony plates {{embedded}} in their skin, a trait {{that appears to}} have evolved independently several times.

50|$|Every closed {{subgroup}} of a locally <b>compact</b> group is locally <b>compact.</b> (The closure condition is necessary {{as the group}} of rationals demonstrates.) Conversely, every locally <b>compact</b> {{subgroup of}} a Hausdorff group is closed. Every quotient of a locally <b>compact</b> group is locally <b>compact.</b> The product {{of a family of}} locally <b>compact</b> groups is locally <b>compact</b> if and only if all but a finite number of factors are actually <b>compact.</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{operator}} T: E → X {{between a}} Banach lattice E and a Banach space X is called b-weakly <b>compact</b> if T (B) is relatively weakly <b>compact</b> for each b-bounded set B in E. We characterize b-weakly <b>compact</b> operators among o-weakly <b>compact</b> operators. We show summing operators are b-weakly <b>compact</b> and discuss relation between Dunford–Pettis and b-weakly <b>compact</b> operators. We give necessary conditions for b-weakly <b>compact</b> operators to be <b>compact</b> and give characterizations of KB-spaces {{in terms of}} b-weakly <b>compact</b> operators defined on them...|$|R
5|$|The {{geometry}} of a back country ski {{depends on its}} purpose—skis suited for forested areas where loose powder can predominate may be shorter and wider than those selected for open, exposed areas where <b>compacted</b> snow may prevail. Sidecut on Telemark skis promotes turning in forest and rugged terrain. Width and short length aid turning in loose and deep snow. Longer, narrower and more rigid skis with sharp edges are suited for snow that has been <b>compacted</b> by wind or freeze-thaw. Touring ski design may represent a general-purpose compromise among these different ski conditions, plus being acceptable for use in groomed tracks. Traction may come from a textured or waxed grip zone, as with classic skis, or from ski skins, which are applied to the ski bottom for long, steep ascents and have hairs or mechanical texture that prevents sliding backwards.|$|E
5|$|Their {{longevity}} may {{be explained}} by the fact that the builders used a relatively dry mix of mortar and aggregate and <b>compacted</b> it by pounding it down to eliminate air pockets. Although derived from earth products, concrete structures would not usually be considered earth structures.|$|E
5|$|These sediments were lithified into {{limestone}} and dolomite {{after they}} were buried and <b>compacted</b> by yet more sediment.

40|$|AbstractHaving in {{mind the}} {{generalization}} of Birkhoff's theorem on doubly stochastic matrices we define <b>compact</b> cellular algebras and <b>compact</b> permutation groups. Arising in this connection weakly <b>compact</b> graphs extend <b>compact</b> graphs introduced by G. Tinhofer. It is proved that <b>compact</b> algebras are exactly the centralizer algebras of <b>compact</b> groups. The technique developed enables us to get nontrivial examples of <b>compact</b> algebras and {{groups as well as}} completely identify <b>compact</b> Frobenius groups and the adjacency algebras of Johnson's and Hamming's schemes. In particular, Petersen's graph proves to be not <b>compact,</b> which answers a question by C. Godsil.

40|$|In {{the paper}} we {{investigate}} topological properties of a topological Brandt λ^ 0 -extension B^ 0 _λ(S) of a semitopological monoid S with zero.

5|$|Earth {{structure}} materials may be {{as simple}} as mud, or mud mixed with straw to make cob. Sturdy dwellings may be also built from sod or turf. Soil may be stabilized by the addition of lime or cement, and may be <b>compacted</b> into rammed earth.

This CIR process is a cost-effective method which recycles the top surface of a road. This pulverized material is mixed with asphalt emulsion and spread and <b>compacted</b> back onto the highway surface. This surface is then recovered with a new seal dependent on traffic volume.|$|E

However, the pits and its associated chambers formed the base floor of the superstructure, which was made up by filling the pits and covering it with mud plaster, and occasionally painted in red ochre. Post-holes around the pits revealed that the superstructures were made of wood built over <b>compacted</b> Karewa soil floors.|$|E

5|$|As the greenstone belts were forming, volcanoes ejected tephra {{into the}} air which settled as sediments to become <b>compacted</b> into the greywackes and mudstones of the Knife Lake and Lake Vermilion formations. Greywackes are poorly sorted {{mixtures}} of clay, mica and quartz that may be derived from the decomposition of pyroclastic debris; {{the presence of this}} debris suggests that some explosive volcanic activity had occurred in the area earlier. The volcanism took place on the surface and the other deformations took place at various depths. Numerous earthquakes accompanied the volcanism and faulting.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius rotula is a {{saprobic}} {{species and}} as such obtains nutrients by decomposing dead organic matter. It grows in deciduous forests and fruits in groups or clusters on dead wood (especially beech), woody debris such as twigs or sticks, and occasionally on rotting leaves. The fruit bodies, which are easily overlooked because of their diminutive size, are often present in abundance after rains. The species is relatively intolerant of low water potentials, and will grow poorly {{or not at all}} under water stress conditions. It is unable to degrade leaf litter until it becomes more fragmented and more <b>compacted</b> so that the water-holding capacity increases in the deeper layers of the soil.
