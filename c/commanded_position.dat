50|$|According to Boeing-published flight {{procedure}}s, A/T {{is engaged}} BEFORE the takeoff procedure and is automatically disconnected two seconds after landing. During flight, manual override of A/T is always available. A release of manual override allows A/T to regain control, and the throttle {{will go back}} to the A/T <b>commanded</b> <b>position</b> except for two modes (Boeing type aircraft): IDLE and THR HLD. In these two modes, the throttle will remain at the manual <b>commanded</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{position}} of the output, measured by the potentiometer, is continually compared to the <b>commanded</b> <b>position</b> from the control (i.e., the radio control). Any difference gives rise to an error signal in the appropriate direction, which drives the electric motor either forwards or backwards, and moving the output shaft to the <b>commanded</b> <b>position.</b> When the servo reaches this position, the error signal reduces and then becomes zero, {{at which point the}} servo stops moving.|$|E
50|$|Almost {{all modern}} servos are {{proportional}} servos, where this <b>commanded</b> <b>position</b> can be anywhere {{within the range}} of movement. Early servos, and a precursor device called an escapement, could only move to a limited number of set positions.|$|E

50|$|More {{sophisticated}} servomotors use optical rotary encoders {{to measure}} {{the speed of the}} output shaft and a variable-speed drive to control the motor speed. Both of these enhancements, usually in combination with a PID control algorithm, allow the servomotor to be brought to its <b>commanded</b> <b>position</b> more quickly and more precisely, with less overshooting.|$|E
50|$|In Botball, {{servo motors}} are {{generally}} used to power an arm or attachment on the robot. They are standard hobby servos, commanded {{to a position}} using a standard pulse-width signal as for remote-control cars and airplanes, {{but in this case}} the signals are generated by the CBC (or earlier controllers). The servos have an angular range from 0 to 180 degrees and provide motor torque to hold the <b>commanded</b> <b>position.</b> Servos can be calibrated from a special control screen on the CBC w/o any programming to test/adjust their mechanical positions for a desired angular command.|$|E
50|$|RC servos {{are used}} to provide {{actuation}} for various mechanical systems such as the steering of a car, the control surfaces on a plane, or the rudder of a boat. Due to their affordability, reliability, and simplicity of control by microprocessors, they are often used in small-scale robotics applications. A standard RC receiver (or a microcontroller) sends pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals to the servo. The electronics inside the servo translate {{the width of the}} pulse into a position. When the servo is commanded to rotate, the motor is powered until the potentiometer reaches the value corresponding to the <b>commanded</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{flight crew}} {{consisted}} of Captain Manjit Singh Sohanpal and co-pilot Arvind Singh Bagga. A criminal case, filed against them {{based on the}} statement of a surviving passenger, was later withdrawn. Both Captain Sohanpal and co-pilot Bagga died in the accident.Investigators later conducted an observation with its Rudder Power Control Unit (PCU). The Main Power Control Unit (MPCU) of the rudder has been a subject of intense debate and discussions and has undergone mandatory modifications {{as a result of}} some previous accident investigations. The PCU has responsible for several high-profile crashes, such as United Airlines Flight 585, USAir Flight 427, and Eastwind Airlines Flight 517. Flight 7412 nose-dived before the crash, as well as two previous crashes, Flight 585 and Flight 427. The rudder locked up in a particular direction, and reversal of rudder to that of the <b>commanded</b> <b>position</b> (anomalous rudder movements such as un-commanded movements). These have been attributed to the secondary slide jamming with the primary slide due to contamination or adverse buildup of tolerances during manufacture. However, investigators later dismissed it and ruled out the failure of the PCU as the cause, and concluded that it was serviceable and was in good condition.|$|E
40|$|A {{system and}} method are {{provided}} for controlling a stepper motor having a rotor and a multi-phase stator. Sinusoidal command signals define a <b>commanded</b> <b>position</b> of the motor's rotor. An actual {{position of the}} rotor is sensed {{as a function of}} an electrical angle between the actual position and the <b>commanded</b> <b>position.</b> The actual position is defined by sinusoidal position signals. An adjustment signal is generated using the sinusoidal command signals and sinusoidal position signals. The adjustment signal is defined {{as a function of the}} cosine of the electrical angle. The adjustment signal is multiplied by each sinusoidal command signal to generate a corresponding set of excitation signals, each of which is applied to a corresponding phase of the multi-phase stator...|$|E
40|$|A force-feel {{system is}} {{implemented}} by mechanically coupling a servo-actuator to and {{in parallel with}} a flight control system. The servo-actuator consists of an electric motor, a gearing device, and a clutch. A commanded cockpit-flight-controller position is achieved by pilot actuation of a trim-switch. The position of the cockpit-flight-controller is compared with the <b>commanded</b> <b>position</b> to form a first error which is processed by a shaping function to correlate the first error with a commanded force at the cockpit-flight-controller. The commanded force on the cockpit-flight-controller provides centering forces and improved control feel for the pilot. In an embodiment, the force-feel system is used as the basic element of stability augmentation system (SAS). The SAS provides a stabilization signal that is compared with the <b>commanded</b> <b>position</b> to form a second error signal. The first error is summed with the second error for processing by the shaping function...|$|E
