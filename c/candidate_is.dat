5|$|BLEU’s {{output is}} always a number between 0 and 1. This value {{indicates}} how similar the candidate text is to the reference texts, with values closer to 1 representing more similar texts. Few human translations will attain a score of 1, since this would indicate that the <b>candidate</b> <b>is</b> identical {{to one of the}} reference translations. For this reason, {{it is not necessary to}} attain a score of 1. Because there are more opportunities to match, adding additional reference translations will increase the BLEU score.|$|E
5|$|Candidates {{may have}} {{previous}} college experience, {{but they may}} not transfer, meaning that regardless of previous college credit, they enter the academy as a fourth class cadet and undergo the entire four-year program. If a <b>candidate</b> <b>is</b> considered academically disqualified and not selected, he or she may receive an offer to attend to the United States Military Academy Preparatory School. Upon graduation from USMAPS, these candidates are appointed to the academy if they receive the recommendation of the USMAPS Commandant and meet medical admission requirements.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{evidence}} of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases trapped in the ice at the surface of Ganymede. The detection of ozone (O3) bands was announced in 1996. In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the dimer (or diatomic) absorption features of molecular oxygen. Such an absorption can arise only if the oxygen is in a dense phase. The best <b>candidate</b> <b>is</b> molecular oxygen trapped in ice. The depth of the dimer absorption bands depends on latitude and longitude, rather than on surface albedo—they tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede, whereas O3 shows an opposite trend. Laboratory work has found that O2 would not cluster or bubble but dissolve in ice at Ganymede's relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K (−173.15°C).|$|E
5|$|Current Electoral College rules tend to {{decrease}} voter turnout in states without close races. Voters living outside the swing {{states have a}} greater certainty of which <b>candidate</b> <b>is</b> likely to win their state. This knowledge of the probable outcome decreases their incentive to vote. A report by the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate found that 2004 voter turnout in competitive swing states grew by 6.3% from the previous presidential election, compared to an increase of only 3.8% in noncompetitive states. A report by The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) found that turnout among eligible voters under age 30 was 64.4% in the 10 closest battleground states and only 47.6% {{in the rest of}} the country—a 17% gap.|$|E
5|$|During the {{ceremony}} of initiation, the <b>candidate</b> <b>is</b> expected to swear (usually on {{a volume of}} sacred text appropriate to his personal religious faith) to fulfil certain obligations as a Mason. In the course of three degrees, new masons will promise to keep the secrets of their degree from lower degrees and outsiders, and to support a fellow Mason in distress (as far as practicality and the law permit). There is instruction as to the duties of a Freemason, but on the whole, Freemasons are left to explore the craft in the manner they find most satisfying. Some will further explore the ritual and symbolism of the craft, others will focus their involvement on the social side of the Lodge, while still others will concentrate on the charitable functions of the lodge.|$|E

5|$|Elections for {{president}} occur {{every five years}} by a national vote. Candidates, {{as soon as they}} are deemed eligible under Article 80 of the Constitution, are tasked with collecting signatures from eligible voters. After 100,000 signatures are collected and certified, the <b>candidate</b> <b>is</b> declared to be official by the Central Elections Committee. In the voting, the secret ballots are collected directly from eligible voters. During the first round of voting, if a candidate earns fifty percent plus one of the votes, they are declared the President-elect. If no one has achieved that number during the first round, then a run-off election will occur between two candidates who won the most votes. The person who wins the most votes in the run-off is declared the President-elect.|$|E
5|$|Emanuel's {{eligibility}} for office was challenged {{on the basis}} of his lack of residency in Chicago for one year prior to the election. The Board of Elections and the Cook County Circuit Court affirmed his eligibility. A divided Court of Appeals reversed the Circuit Court, holding on January 24, 2011, that residency for purposes of a <b>candidate</b> <b>is</b> different from residency for purposes of being a voter. A further appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court resulted in a unanimous decision reversing the Court of Appeals and affirming Emanuel's eligibility.|$|E
5|$|In addition, at {{some time}} between {{the date of the}} writ of {{election}} and 12:00 noon on nomination day, the potential candidate or someone on his or her behalf must hand to the returning officer a deposit amounting to three times of 8% of the total allowances payable to an MP in the preceding calendar year, rounded to the nearest $500. At the 2017 presidential election, the deposit was $43,500. The deposit is returned if the person is not nominated as a candidate, withdraws his or her candidature, or is eventually elected. If the <b>candidate</b> <b>is</b> unsuccessful at the election, the deposit is only repaid if he or she polled more than one-eighth {{of the total number of}} votes polled, not including rejected votes.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} what human organs are {{affected}} by interaction with promethium; a possible <b>candidate</b> <b>is</b> the bone tissues. Sealed promethium-147 is not dangerous. However, if the packaging is damaged, then promethium becomes dangerous {{to the environment and}} humans. If radioactive contamination is found, the contaminated area should be washed with water and soap, but, even though promethium mainly affects the skin, the skin should not be abraded. If a promethium leak is found, the area should be identified as hazardous and evacuated, and emergency services must be contacted. No dangers from promethium aside from the radioactivity are known.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Eurymedon {{has been}} dated to 469 BC by Plutarch's anecdote about the Archon Apsephion (469/468 BC) {{choosing}} Cimon {{and his fellow}} generals as judges in a competition. The implication is that Cimon had recently achieved a great victory, and the most likely <b>candidate</b> <b>is</b> Eurymedon. However, since the Battle of Eurymedon seems to have occurred after the Athenian siege of Naxos (but before the Siege of Thasos), the date of Eurymedon is clearly constrained by the date of Naxos. Whilst some accept a date of 469 or earlier for this Naxos, another school of thought places it as late as 467 BC. Since the Battle of Eurymedon seems to have occurred before Thasos, the alternative date for this battle would therefore be 466 BC. Modern historians are split, some supporting 469 BC as the most likely date, and others opting for 466 BC.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of Masonic ritual {{consists}} of degree ceremonies. Candidates for Freemasonry are progressively initiated into Freemasonry, {{first in the}} degree of Entered Apprentice. Some time later, in a separate ceremony, they will be passed to the degree of Fellowcraft, and finally they will be raised to the degree of Master Mason. In all of these ceremonies, the <b>candidate</b> <b>is</b> entrusted with passwords, signs and grips (secret handshakes) peculiar to his new rank. Another ceremony is the annual installation of the Master and officers of the Lodge. In some jurisdictions Installed Master is valued as a separate rank, with its own secrets to distinguish its members. In other jurisdictions, the grade is not recognised, and no inner ceremony conveys new secrets during the installation of a new Master of the Lodge.|$|E

5|$|The {{president}} is elected {{on the basis}} of universal suffrage, through a secret ballot, for a five-year term. If no candidate in the elections secures more than 50% of the votes, a runoff election is held in 14 days. The Constitution of Croatia sets a limit to a maximum of two terms in office and requires election dates to be determined within 30 to 60days before the expiry of the term of the incumbent president. Any citizen of Croatia of 18 or over may be a candidate in a presidential election, provided that the <b>candidate</b> <b>is</b> endorsed by 10,000 voters. The endorsements are required in form of a list containing name, address, personal identification number and voter signature. The presidential elections are regulated by an act of the parliament.|$|E
5|$|TypeIa supernovae {{are thought}} to be {{potentially}} the most dangerous if they occur close enough to the Earth. Because these supernovae arise from dim, common white dwarf stars in binary systems, it is likely that a supernova that can affect the Earth will occur unpredictably and in a star system that is not well studied. The closest known <b>candidate</b> <b>is</b> IK Pegasi (see below). Recent estimates predict that a TypeII supernova would have to be closer than eight parsecs (26light-years) to destroy half of the Earth's ozone layer, and there are no such candidates closer than about 500 light years.|$|E
5|$|Whether a {{timeframe}} {{should be}} imposed for the calling of by-elections has {{been subject to}} much debate. Several arguments have been advanced by the Government. First, when a voter casts a vote for a candidate, he is also voting for the political party that the <b>candidate</b> <b>is</b> a member of. Thus, once the party has received the voter's mandate, a vacant seat will not affect this mandate. Requiring the other members in a GRC to vacate their seats so that a by-election can be called {{would be unfair to}} them. Secondly, the Government believes that a GRC can function if it is lacking a member, as MPs from other constituencies can help {{to address the needs of}} residents in that GRC.|$|E
