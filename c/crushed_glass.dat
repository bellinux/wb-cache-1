500|$|McConnell's work {{mainly focused}} on poison and blood analysis, and she testified in many {{criminal}} cases {{as an expert}} witness. Her work often involved determining {{the cause of death}} when poisoning was suspected. In 1930, she investigated the death of a ten-year-old Denver girl; the case was referred to at the time as the city's [...] "most famous and controversial murder case". Although she initially suspected the girl had been poisoned, McConnell discovered <b>crushed</b> <b>glass</b> in the girl's stomach and blood stains in the family car; her testimony led to the sentencing of the girl's stepmother for murder. In 1936, McConnell testified against suspected rapist and murderer Joe Arridy after finding fibers from the bedspread at the murder scene under the suspect's fingernails. (Although Arridy was convicted of murder and executed in 1939, he was granted a posthumous pardon in 2011.) McConnell also discovered that murder victim Georg Obendoerfer had been killed with a lethal dose of arsenic, which led to further investigations confirming that Anna Marie Hahn had killed Obendoerfer, as well as other men in the same way. McConnell testified at Hahn's trial in Cincinnati and Hahn was subsequently convicted and executed. After she was called to Raton, New Mexico as a key witness in a murder trial in 1935, a court reporter for the Raton Range wrote that McConnell [...] "has gained a national reputation ... in her blood analysis work". Additionally, she is thought to be the United States' first female forensic pathologist. Despite working on numerous high-profile, widely publicized cases, McConnell kept her life as private as possible and only ever gave one interview during her career.|$|E

2500|$|The main type {{of glass}} {{found in the}} Anglo-Saxon period is a soda-lime-silica glass, {{continuing}} the Roman tradition of producing glass. There is very little evidence for glass making from the raw materials in Roman Britain and even less evidence in Anglo-Saxon Britain. It would have been nearly impossible to transport the natron from the Middle East to Britain. It is therefore far more likely, that as in the Roman period, glass was being produced near the raw materials and then lumps of raw glass transported. Another source of glass was cullet, recycled broken or <b>crushed</b> <b>glass.</b> Recycling was carried out throughout the Roman period, and large deposits of broken glass at Winchester and Hamwic suggest glass was also being recycled in the Anglo-Saxon period. It is possible that by recycling glass in this way {{it was possible to}} keep up to the demand for glass products without new raw glass having to be introduced into the system. Additional cullet may also have been collected from the ruins of abandoned Romano-British sites. In the late 7-8th century with the construction of many ecclesiastical establishments and large windows, the demand for glass grew. At this time political problems in the Delta-Wadi Natrun region caused a shortage of natron in the Middle East where the raw glass was produced. This possibly led to [...] glass makers experimenting with new fluxes, which finally led to the introduction of wood ash glasses using potash as the main alkali flux, which was more readily available.|$|E

40|$|Issue: Slow rate {{filtration}} {{systems are}} {{an alternative to}} conventional rapid sand filters in the pretreatment of community drinking water. These systems are relatively easy to construct and maintain, but require large quantities of filter media. The traditional slow rate filtration medium is sand, but {{research has suggested that}} <b>crushed</b> recycled <b>glass</b> can be an effective medium in slow rate filtration systems. Further testing is needed to determine proper maintenance techniques and long-term filter performance. This Best Practice briefly discusses current knowledge of the preparation and placement of <b>crushed</b> recycled <b>glass</b> as a slow rate filter medium. Many of the recommendations presented here are common to other types of filter media. Best Practice: Slow rate filtration systems typically consist of a layer of filter medium placed on a layer of support gravel, the thicknesses of which will vary by design. During filtration, water passes through the filter medium and out the support gravel. Typical flow rates for filtration systems of this type vary between 0. 04 and 0. 10 gallons per minute per square foot of filter cross-section (gpm/ft 2). Research suggests that <b>crushed</b> recycled <b>glass</b> may be used effectively as a filter medium in systems of this type. Tests using pilot column filters indicate that when prepared and placed properly, the filtration abilities of <b>crushed</b> recycled <b>glass</b> are comparable to those of natural sand.

40|$|We have {{characterized}} the corrosion behavior of several Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) reference waste glasses by conducting static dissolution tests with <b>crushed</b> <b>glasses.</b> Glass dissolution rates were calculated from measured B concentrations in tests conducted {{for up to}} five years. The dissolution rates of all glasses increased significantly after certain alteration phases precipitated. Calculation of the dissolution rates was complicated by the decrease in the available surface area as the glass dissolves. We took the loss of surface area into account by modeling the particles to be spheres, then extracting from the short-term test results the dissolution rate corresponding to a linear decrease in the radius of spherical particles. The measured extent of dissolution in tests conducted for longer times was less than predicted with this linear dissolution model. This indicates that advanced stages of corrosion are affected by another process besides dissolution, which we believe to be associated with a decrease in the precipitation rate of the alteration phases. These results show that the dissolution rate measured soon after the formation of certain alteration phases provides an upper limit for the long-term dissolution rate, and can be used to determine a bounding value for the source term for radionuclide release from waste glasses. The long-term dissolution rates measured in tests at 20, 000 per m at 90 {degrees}C in tuff groundwater at pH values near 12 for the Environmental Assessment glass and glasses made with SRL 131 and SRL 202 frits, respectively...|$|R
