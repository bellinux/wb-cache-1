Family therapy or education, which addresses the whole family system of an individual, may reduce relapses and hospitalizations. Evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in either reducing symptoms or preventing relapse is minimal. Evidence for metacognitive training is mixed with one 2016 review finding benefit and another not. Art or drama therapy have not been well-researched.|$|E

25|$|In some locations, {{such as the}} United States, {{voluntary}} hospitalizations are {{outnumbered by}} involuntary commitments {{partly due to the}} fact that insurance tends not to pay for hospitalization unless an imminent danger exists to the individual or community. In addition, psychiatric emergency service settings admit approximately one third of patients from assertive <b>community</b> <b>treatment</b> centers. Therefore, patients who are not admitted will be referred to services in the community.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} {{treatment of}} psychiatric medication and psychotherapy {{has become the}} most common mode of psychiatric treatment in current practice, but contemporary practice also includes a wide variety of other modalities, e.g., assertive <b>community</b> <b>treatment,</b> community reinforcement, and supported employment. Treatment may be delivered on an inpatient or outpatient basis, depending on the severity of functional impairment or on other aspects of the disorder in question. Research and treatment within psychiatry as a whole are conducted on an interdisciplinary basis, e.g., with epidemiologists, mental health counselors, nurses, psychologists, public health specialists, radiologists, and/or social workers.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent the}} {{recidivism}} {{of individuals with}} mental illness, a variety of programs are in place {{that are based on}} criminal justice or mental health intervention models. Programs modeled after criminal justice strategies include diversion programs, mental health courts, specialty mental health probation or parole, and jail aftercare/prison re-entry. Programs modeled after mental health interventions include forensic assertive <b>community</b> <b>treatment</b> and forensic intensive case management. It has been argued that the wide diversity of these program interventions points to a lack of clarity on which specific program components are most effective in reducing recidivism rates among individuals with mental illness.|$|E
40|$|The {{authors of}} Chapter 12 (Cavatassi et al.) {{performed}} an ex-post evaluation using econometric techniques common in impact evaluations. They assessed whether participation in Ecuador’s Plataformas program, which establishes alliances between small-scale farmers {{and a range}} of agricultural support-service providers, had any effect on income. The chapter finds that the program had a positive impact on yields, prices, and gross margins. The authors conducted baseline household and community surveys in two Ecuadorean provinces and then identified <b>treatment</b> <b>communities.</b> Using data from the most recent census, they constructed a counterfactual control group with similar geographical, agroecological, and sociodemographic characteristics to the <b>treatment</b> <b>communities.</b> They then used PSM to identify which control communities were most similar to each <b>treatment</b> <b>community.</b> In addition to creating control communities, they also factored in households in <b>treatment</b> <b>communities</b> that did not participate in the program.
