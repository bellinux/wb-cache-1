25|$|After {{returning}} to Japan in 2003, Tokumaru finished recording a 10 track demo album called Fragment. He gave this demo CD {{to a friend}} who was an acquaintance of Trevor Sias, owner of the US independent record label Music Related. The label was impressed with the CD, and wanted to release the demo album just as it was; however, Tokumaru did not like the idea. He created an entirely new album, which was released under the label in the United States on May 11, 2004. Night Piece originally planned to be just an American only release, but due to strong sales on internet sites, it was released in other countries. It was released in Japan in August 2004 through the independent label <b>Compare</b> <b>Notes.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} (but {{not universally}} accepted) solution {{is offered by}} the many worlds theory of quantum mechanics. According to this, not only is collapse of the wave function illusory, but the apparent random branching of possible futures when quantum systems interact with the macroscopic world is also an illusion. Measurement {{does not lead to}} a random choice of possible outcome; rather, the only ingredient of quantum mechanics is the unitary evolution of the wave function. All possibilities co-exist forever and the only reality is the quantum mechanical wave function. According to this view, two distant observers both split into superpositions when measuring a spin. The Bell inequality violations are no longer counterintuitive, because it is not clear which copy of the observer B will be seen by observer A when they <b>compare</b> <b>notes.</b> If reality includes all the different outcomes, locality in physical space (not outcome space) places no restrictions on how the split observers can meet up.|$|E
500|$|Hentoff grew up {{attending}} an Orthodox synagogue in Boston. He {{recalled that}} as a youth, he would travel around the city with his father during the High Holidays to listen to various cantors and <b>compare</b> <b>notes</b> on their performances. He said cantors made [...] "sacred texts compellingly clear to the heart," [...] and he collected their recordings. In later life, Hentoff was an atheist, and has sardonically described himself as [...] "a member of the Proud and Ancient Order of Stiff-Necked Jewish Atheists". He expressed sympathy for Israel's Peace Now movement.|$|E

500|$|The aliens take a keen {{interest}} examining the human response to this crisis, and <b>compare</b> <b>notes</b> to previous reactions by Klingons and Cardassians. They are members of an advanced species looking to make [...] "first contact". So far, based on 10,000 years of observations, no species has been deemed ready. Seeking {{a different view of}} the crew, they temporarily shift to the bodies of Phlox, T'Pol, and Archer. A difference in opinion between the two aliens starts to form: one seems determined to maintain their non-interference protocol, while the other feels the protocol is outdated and unnecessary.|$|E
500|$|Players' {{reactions}} to MissingNo. {{have been the}} subject of sociological studies. Sociologist William Sims Bainbridge stated that Game Freak created [...] "one of the most popular glitches ever in game history", and cited its creative usage by players. In the book Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon, professor of education Julian Sefton-Green noticed that in his study of his son's reaction to MissingNo.'s usage as a [...] "cheat", the child's outlook towards the game was altered drastically, and added that the presence of such elements as a result broke the illusion of the game as an enclosed world and reminded them that [...] "at heart, it is a computer program". The book Playing with Videogames contains an in-depth study of MissingNo., which details players' curiosity when encountering the Pokémon. It describes their tendency to <b>compare</b> <b>notes</b> on its appearance, and to give assessment and critique to each other's findings. The book states that, in their attempts to interpret MissingNo. as part of the series's narrative through fan art and fiction, Pokémon communities celebrated the game's imperfections and tried to imprint themselves on its canon. The author described these circumstances as unique to MissingNo., and called its popularity an unusual case.|$|E
