40|$|The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris GS 115, {{a widely}} used strain in {{production}} of various heterologous proteins, especially membrane-bound enzymes, can also produce linoleic and linolenic acids, {{which indicates the}} existence of membrane-bound Δ 12 and Δ 15 -fatty acid desaturases. This paper describes the <b>cloning</b> <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> <b>characterization</b> of a novel Δ 12 -fatty acid desaturase gene from this methylotrophic yeast. The open reading frame of the gene (named Pp-FAD 12) is 1263 bp in size and encodes a 420 -amino-acid peptide. The deduced Pp-FAD 12 protein shows high identity (50 – 67 %) with Δ 12 -fatty acid desaturases from other fungi. It also shows a high identity (57 %) with Δ 15 -fatty acid desaturase (named Sk-FAD 15) from Saccharomyces kluyveri. Expression of Pp-FAD 12 in polyunsaturated fatty acids non-producing yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated that its product converted oleic acid (18 : 1) to linoleic acid (18 : 2). This result suggests that Pp-FAD 12 encodes a novel Δ 12 -fatty acid desaturase in P. pastoris GS 115.

We have investigated essential fatty acid metabolism in this species, focusing on the endogenous highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) synthesis pathway using both biochemical and molecular biological approaches. Fatty acyl desaturase (Fad) and elongase (Elovl) cDNAs were <b>cloned</b> <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> <b>characterization</b> identified them as ∆ 6 Fad and Elovl 5 elongase enzymes, respectively. The ∆ 6 Fad was equally active towards 18 : 3 n- 3 and 18 : 2 n- 6, and Elovl 5 exhibited elongation activity for C 18 - 20 and C 20 - 22 elongation and a trace of C 22 - 24 activity. The tissue profile of gene expression for ∆ 6 fad and elovl 5 genes, showed brain to have the highest expression of both genes compared to all other tissues. The results of tissue fatty acid analysis showed that the brain contained more docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22 : 6 n- 3) than flesh, liver and intestine. The HUFA synthesis activity in isolated hepatocytes and enterocytes using [1 - 14 C] 18 : 3 n- 3 as substrate was very low with the only desaturated product detected being 18 : 4 n- 3. These findings indicate that L. calcarifer display an essential fatty acid pattern similar to other marine fish in that they appear unable to synthesize HUFA from C 18 substrates. High expression of ∆ 6 fad and elovl 5 genes in brain may indicate a role for these enzymes in maintaining high DHA levels in neural tissues through conversion of 20 : 5 n- 3...|$|R

These contain heat shock factor 1 (HSF- 1) and a specific subset of pre-mRNA processing factors. Nuclear stress bodies are assembled on specific pericentromeric heterochromatic domains containing satellite III (SatIII) DNA. In response to stress, these domains change their epigenetic status from heterochromatin to euchromatin and are transcribed in poly-adenylated RNAs that remain associated with nSBs. In this article, {{we describe the}} <b>cloning,</b> sequencing, <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> <b>characterization</b> of these transcripts. They are composed of SatIII repeats and originate from the transcription of multiple sites within the SatIII arrays.

Knockdown of SatIII RNA by siRNAs requires the activity of Argonaute 2, {{a component of the}} RNA-induced silencing complex. Down-regulation of satellite III RNAs significantly affects the recruitment of RNA processing factors to nSBs without altering the association of HSF- 1 with these structures nor the presence of acetylated histones within nSBs.

Here, FaPIP 2; 1, an aquaporin subtype of PIP 2 was <b>cloned</b> <b>and</b> its <b>functional</b> <b>characterization</b> in Xenopus oocytes determined. The FaPIP 2; 1 gene encodes a water channel with high water permeability (Pf) that is regulated by cytosolic pH. Interestingly, the co-expression of both FaPIP subtypes resulted in an enhancement of water permeability, showing Pf values that exceeds their individual contribution. The expression pattern of both aquaporin subtypes in two cultivars with contrasting fruit firmness showed that the firmer cultivar (Camarosa) has a higher accumulation of FaPIP 1 and FaPIP 2 mRNAs during fruit ripening {{when compared with the}} softer cultivar (Toyonoka). In conclusion, not only FaPIP aquaporins showed an expression pattern associated with fruit firmness but it was also shown that the enhancement of water transfer through the plasma membrane is coupled to the presence/absence of the co-expression of both subtypes...|$|R

In this study, we report on the cloning of cDNA(s) encoding E box (59 -CACGTG- 39) -binding protein from a rat granulosa cell cDNA library using a yeast one-hybrid sys-tem. When multiple E box sequences were used as target, we obtained a positive clone that encodes the rat homologue of upstream stimulatory factor 2 (USF 2). An analysis of the nucle-otide sequence and its deduced amino acid sequence reveals that rat USF 2 protein consists of 346 amino acid residues and belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper protein fam-ily. Northern blot analysis shows that rat USF 2 mRNA exists as multiple forms between 1. 6 and 2. 2 kilobases. The size of the cloned insert was identical to that of the transcript of maximal length. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that in vitro-translated rat USF 2 specifically binds to the E box. In addition, cotransfection experiments with luciferase-reporter constructs in HepG 2 cells reveal that the overexpression of rat USF 2 leads to an increase of luciferase activity in the E box sequence-de-pendent manner.

AtCNGC 2 expression in a yeast mutant lacking a low-affinity K+ uptake system complements growth inhibition only when lipophilic cyclic nucleotides are present in the culture medium. Voltage clamp analysis indicates that Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with AtCNGC 2 cRNA demonstrate cyclic-nucleotide-dependent, inward-rectifying K+ currents. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) transfected with AtCNGC 2 cDNA demonstrate increased permeability to Ca 2 + only in the presence of lipophilic cyclic nucleotides.

Based on the sequence homology, it has been designated hUGT 2 A 1. The gene was mapped to chromosome 4 q 13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The expression appeared to be specific for the olfactory tissue. The substrate specificity of this isoform was assessed using Chinese hamster V 79 cells stably transfected with the isolated cDNA. The expressed enzyme showed a broad substrate spectrum including a range of phenolic compounds as well as aliphatic and monoterpenoid alcohols, among them many odorants. Furthermore, some steroids, especially androgens, some drugs and carcinogens were conjugated. The results support a role of the enzyme in olfactory perception and in protection of the neural system against airborne hazardous chemicals...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{considerable}} advances {{have occurred in}} understanding the molecular biology and biophysics of water permeation across plant membranes and tissues. Spurred on by the rapid advances in <b>cloning</b> <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> <b>characterization</b> of a superfamily of major intrinsic proteins, some of which function as aquaporins, the biophysics of transport of water and small non-electrolytes across plant membranes is being re-examined based on the proposed function of these membrane-integral proteins in their native membranes. This review focuses {{on a number of}} issues that are central to an understanding of aquaporin function: (1) the need to be able to test for water-channel activity in native membranes; (2) the implications of the observed solute/water selectivity of aquaporins; (3) the putative functional roles of aquaporins at the cell, tissue and organ levels in plants; and (4) information that can be obtained from studies of the abundance, diversity and expression patterns of aquaporins. It is clear that to answer many of the critical questions that remain concerning aquaporin function, combined studies using appropriate molecular and biophysical techniques will be required...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNa+-dependent, high-affinity choline uptake in {{cholinergic}} neurons is the rate-limiting step in acetylcholine synthesis. Here {{we report}} the molecular <b>cloning</b> <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> <b>characterization</b> {{of the human}} high-affinity choline transporter (hCHT 1). The hCHT 1 exhibits significant homology with known members of the Na+-dependent glucose transporter family, but not {{with members of the}} neurotransmitter transporter family. The human CHT 1 gene is 25 kb in length with 9 exons and was assigned to chromosome II at position IIq 11 – 12. Northern blot analysis showed that a 5. 4 kb hCHT 1 transcript was expressed exclusively in tissues containing cholinergic neurons. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the human clone induced Na+- and Cl−-dependent, high-affinity choline uptake, which was sensitive to the specific inhibitor hemicholinium- 3, with a Ki of 1. 3 nM. The hCHT 1 -mediated choline uptake increased with increasing concentrations of choline, Na+ and Cl−, with EC 50 values of 2. 0 μM, 76 mM, and 48 mM, and with apparent Hill coefficients of 1, 2. 5 and 2. 3, respectively...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNucleotide binding protein 1 (Nubp 1) is {{a highly}} conserved {{phosphate}} loop (P-loop) ATPase involved in diverse processes including iron–sulfur protein assembly, centrosome duplication and lung development. Here, we report the <b>cloning,</b> expression <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> <b>characterization</b> of Xenopus laevis Nubp 1. We show that xNubp 1 is expressed maternally, displays elevated expression in neural tissues and is required for convergent extension movements and neural tube closure. In addition, xNubp 1 knockdown leads to defective ciliogenesis of the multi-ciliated cells of the epidermis {{as well as the}} monociliated cells of the gastrocoel roof plate. Specifically, xNubp 1 is required for basal body migration, spacing and docking in multi-ciliated cells and basal body positioning and axoneme elongation in monociliated gastrocoel roof plate cells. Live imaging of the different pools of actin and basal body migration during the process of ciliated cell intercalation revealed that two independent pools of actin are present from the onset of cell intercalation; an internal network surrounding the basal bodies, anchoring them to the cell cortex and an apical pool of punctate actin which eventually matures into the characteristic apical actin network. We show that xNubp 1 colocalizes with the apical actin network of multiciliated cells and that problems in basal body transport in xNubp 1 morphants are associated with defects of the internal network of actin, while spacing and polarity issues are due to a failure of the apical and sub-apical actin pools to mature into a network. Effects of xNubp 1 knockdown on the actin cytoskeleton are independent of RhoA localization and activation, suggesting that xNubp 1 may have a direct role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton...|$|R
40|$|The UDP glycosyltransferases (UGT) attach sugar {{residues}} {{to small}} lipophilic chemicals {{to alter their}} biological properties and enhance elimination. Of the four families present in mammals, two families, UGT 1 and UGT 2, use UDP glucuronic acid to glucuronidate bilirubin, steroids, bile acids, drugs, and many other endogenous chemicals and xenobiotics. UGT 8, in contrast, uses UDP galactose to galactosidate ceramide, {{an important step in}} the synthesis of glycosphingolipids and cerebrosides. The function of the fourth family, UGT 3, is unknown. Here we report the <b>cloning,</b> expression, <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> <b>characterization</b> of UGT 3 A 1. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP N-acetylglucosamine to ursodeoxycholic acid (3 α, 7 β-dihydroxy- 5 β-cholanoic acid). The enzyme uses ursodeoxycholic acid and UDP N-acetylglucosamine in preference to other primary and secondary bile acids, and other UDP sugars such as UDP glucose, UDP glucuronic acid, UDP galactose, and UDP xylose. In addition to ursodeoxycholic acid, UGT 3 A 1 has activity toward 17 α-estradiol, 17 β-estradiol, and the prototypic substrates of the UGT 1 and UGT 2 forms, 4 -nitrophenol and 1 -naphthol. A polymorphic UGT 3 A 1 variant containing a C 121 G substitution was catalytically inactive. UGT 3 A 1 is found in the liver and kidney, and to a lesser, in the gastrointestinal tract. These data describe the first characterization of a member of the UGT 3 family. Its activity and distribution suggest that UGT 3 A 1 may have {{an important role in the}} metabolism and elimination of ursodeoxycholic acid in therapies for ameliorating the symptoms of cholestasis or for dissolving gallstones...|$|R
40|$|Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is {{the active}} {{ingredient}} in the increasingly important immunosuppressive pharmaceuticals CellCept (Roche) and Myfortic (Novartis). Despite {{the long history of}} MPA, the molecular basis for its biosynthesis has remained enigmatic. Here we report the discovery of a polyketide synthase (PKS), MpaC, which we successfully characterized and identified as responsible for MPA production in Penicillium brevicompactum. mpaC resides in what most likely is a 25 -kb gene cluster in the genome of Penicillium brevicompactum. The gene cluster was successfully localized by targeting putative resistance genes, in this case an additional copy of the gene encoding IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH). We report the <b>cloning,</b> sequencing, <b>and</b> the <b>functional</b> <b>characterization</b> of the MPA biosynthesis gene cluster by deletion of the polyketide synthase gene mpaC of P. brevicompactum and bioinformatic analyses. As expected, the gene deletion completely abolished MPA production as well as production of several other metabolites derived from the MPA biosynthesis pathway of P. brevicompactum. Our work sets the stage for engineering the production of MPA and analogues through metabolic engineering...|$|R
