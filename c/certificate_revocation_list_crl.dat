50|$|Its {{purpose is}} to offer an easy to use {{interface}} for creating certification authorities and all related elements including X.509 digital certificates, certificate signing requests (CSRs) and <b>certificate</b> <b>revocation</b> <b>lists</b> (<b>CRLs).</b>|$|R
50|$|Certificate {{authorities}} are {{also responsible for}} maintaining up-to-date <b>revocation</b> information about <b>certificates</b> they have issued, indicating whether certificates are still valid. They provide this information through Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) and/or <b>Certificate</b> <b>Revocation</b> <b>Lists</b> (<b>CRLs).</b>|$|R
30|$|Internet {{attribute}} <b>certificates</b> {{support a}} <b>revocation</b> checking model based either on <b>certificate</b> <b>revocation</b> <b>lists</b> (<b>CRL)</b> {{or on the}} Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). To simplify processing and minimize the overhead, however, we chose not to use revocation checking in our solution.|$|R
5000|$|Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) / <b>{{certificate}}</b> <b>revocation</b> <b>list</b> (<b>CRL)</b> — this is {{to check}} certificate revocation status.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{vehicular}} ad hoc network (VANET) uses cars as mobile nodes in a MANET {{to create}} a mobile network. For security Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) adopt the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and <b>Certificate</b> <b>Revocation</b> <b>Lists</b> (<b>CRLs).</b> In the Public Key Infrastructure system the authentication of a received message is performed by checking if the certificate of the sender {{is included in the}} current <b>Certificate</b> <b>Revocation</b> <b>Lists</b> (<b>CRLs)</b> and verifying the authenticity of the certificate and signature of the sender. But it takes more time for CRL checking process. So in order to overcome this problem we use an efficient revocation check process in EMAP uses a keyed Hash Message Authentication Code(HMAC), where the key used in calculating the HMAC is shared only between non-revoked On-Board Units (OBUs). In addition, EMAP uses a novel probabilistic key distribution which enables non-revoked OBUs to securely share and update a secret key. To conquer computation overhead we introduce the data aggregation using probabilistic checking that can accelerate message verifications and significantly reduce computational overhead while retaining satisfactory security...|$|R
50|$|X.509 also {{includes}} standards for <b>certificate</b> <b>revocation</b> <b>list</b> (<b>CRL)</b> implementations, an often neglected aspect of PKI systems. The IETF-approved way of checking a certificate's validity is the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). Firefox 3 enables OCSP checking by default, as do versions of Windows {{from at least}} Vista and later.|$|E
30|$|In {{clustered}} WSNs using {{public key}} infrastructure, a gateway as a certificate authority (CA) can issue a <b>certificate</b> <b>revocation</b> <b>list</b> (<b>CRL)</b> containing {{a list of}} keys to be revoked. Since, in the proposed scheme, node-to-node authentication is considered with the pairwise key allocation, then detecting and reporting misbehaved nodes is possible.|$|E
30|$|As {{the network}} {{supports}} the V 2 I mode, the trusted RSUs service as guards may accuse a compromised vehicle that creates or forwards incorrect Warn# message. If {{the number of}} accusations against a suspected vehicle achieves a threshold, the certificate of the vehicle will be expired and added in the <b>certificate</b> <b>revocation</b> <b>list</b> (<b>CRL)</b> by the trusted party. If a trusted vehicle accuses a suspect vehicle, the accusation will be verified {{by a number of}} its neighboring RSUs. If the accusation is correct, then the RSUs will report the result to the trusted third party through its management servers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We present {{architecture}} for a relying-party {{to manage}} credentials, {{and in particular}} to map different credentials into common format and semantics. This will allow use of simple, widely available credentials {{as well as more}} advanced credentials such as public key certificates, attribute certificates and `Negative ` credentials (which result in reduced trust) such as <b>certificate</b> <b>revocation</b> <b>lists</b> (<b>CRL).</b> The core of the architecture is a Credential Manager who collects credentials, and maps them to common format and semantics. ...|$|R
40|$|Secure {{usage of}} public key {{certificates}} {{relies on the}} possibility to revoke such a certificate in certain situations, for example in case its corresponding private key is compromised. The usual approach for providing revocation information is based on <b>Certificate</b> <b>Revocation</b> <b>Lists</b> (<b>CRLs).</b> CRLs need to be downloaded frequently by end-users to insure the timeliness of the revocation information. In networks consisting of mobile devices, and in ad-hoc networks, this dependency on on-line access can drastically reduce the usability of CRLs...|$|R
40|$|Certificates {{are used}} in many applications. These {{certificates}} issued by a certificate authority must be checked by a relying party, {{in order to establish}} a chain of trust.

40|$|In IEEE ISI 2008, an {{anonymous}} attribute authentication scheme {{has been proposed}} using a self-blindable certificate scheme. This scheme enables the anonymity and certificate revocation.

40|$|Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) were de-signed {{to provide}} safety and comfort for passen-gers. Security {{measurements}} {{have to be}} taken for guaranteeing these. The security consists in making use of asymmetric cryptography for sign-ing messages sent out by the vehicle. But cryp-tographic material can be compromised or a mis-behavior can occur due to some errors. For these reasons the VANET entities credentials should be revoked. The Certificate Authority (CA), for this reason, will make <b>Certificate</b> <b>Revocation</b> <b>Lists</b> (<b>CRLs)</b> and send them to the vehicles.

One of the ultimate goals in the design of such networking is to resist various malicious abuses and security attacks. In this research new security mechanism is proposed to reduce the channel load resulted from frequent warning broadcasting happened in the adversary discovery process – Accusation Report (AR) - which produces a heavy channel load from all the vehicles in the road to report about any new adversary disovery. Furthermore, this mechanism will replace the <b>Certificate</b> <b>Revocation</b> <b>List</b> (<b>CRL),</b> which cause long delay and high load on the channel with Local Revocation List (LRL) which will make it fast and easy in the adversary discovery process...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{projects}} have been developing security architectures for Vehicular Communication (VC) systems, with consensus on utilizing public key cryptography to secure communications. In spite of their advanced status on many aspects, none of these projects, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, has investigated and addressed the problem of <b>Certificate</b> <b>Revocation</b> <b>List</b> (<b>CRL)</b> distribution. As the need to evict compromised, faulty, or illegitimate nodes from the VC system is commonly accepted, our contribution here is a solution tailored to the requirements and constraints of the VC systems. Our design is scalable and efficient, and can deliver seamlessly CRLs to all nodes within a region within tenths of minutes. More general, our analysis and simulation evaluation set the basis for the design of such CRL distribution systems, showing how to configure them to achieve more stringent requirements. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{efficient}} pseudonymous authentication scheme with strong privacy preservation, named PASS, for vehicular communications. Unlike traditional pseudonymous authentication schemes, {{the size of}} <b>Certificate</b> <b>Revocation</b> <b>List</b> (<b>CRL)</b> in PASS is linear {{with the number of}} revoked vehicles and irrelated to how many pseudonymous certificates are held by the revoked vehicles. PASS supports Roadside Unitsaided distributed certificate service that allows the vehicles to update certificates on road, but the service overhead is almost irrelated to the number of the updated certificates. Furthermore, PASS provides strong privacy preservation to the vehicles so that the adversaries can not trace any vehicle even all Roadside Units have been compromised. Extensive simulations demonstrate that PASS outperforms previously reported ones in terms of the revocation cost and the certificate updating overhead.
