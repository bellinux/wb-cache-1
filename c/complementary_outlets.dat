This article explains the origin and the characteristics of the exporting model which was in the heart of the growth strategies of developing countries. It also analyzes how the crisis on the emerging and developing economies impacted the theoretical paradigm on development and incites the economic community to revisit the foundations of new growth models which rely on both a new international macroeconomics and on the return to markets domestic as <b>complementary</b> <b>outlets</b> of the production and source of growth.

40|$|Local food {{initiatives}} {{create a}} niche market in {{many developed countries}} where consumer choice is being met with an expanding offering in both conventional as well as <b>complementary</b> retail <b>outlets.</b> Supermarkets {{in conjunction with the}} food service sector currently dominate food sales and consumption, and are likely to do so for the foreseeable future. However, the local food sector offers an opportunity for implementing niche marketing strategies for many businesses. Local food activities tend to be relatively independent activities and a clearer definition for “local” food would assist in consolidating this important component of the food system. Related to this, consumers would benefit from the establishment of some form of assurance system for the ‘localness’ of food. In the UK, with its well established local food market, farmers’ markets, farm shops and box schemes are currently having the largest impact in terms of total sales. Hence further research is required to confirm that support for similar business ventures in Australia would be a viable strategy for strengthening its local food systems. ...|$|R

From consumer’s perspectives these fresh or raw products are significantly different products from their frozen or processed alternatives, and so face different demand parameters. This product differentiation is nearly always ignored in trade models, which instead assume homogenous commodities. Where local fresh products make up over 90 % of sales, such as pork in Vietnam, this unrecognized product differentiation can undermine model results, since raw or fresh products are generally untradeable. Examples of such limitations on trade are given for several developing countries, including some African nations. Religious consideration {{can also be a}} factor restricting international trade in livestock products and sometimes, government regulations on food imports reflect the tastes of local buyers, for example their demands for food purity and so on. Some simple economic analysis is provided of how local producers of livestock benefit from natural protection. Drawing on the results of recent research completed in Vietnam and other sources, factors that provide natural protection to Vietnam’s pork industry are identified, and particular attention is given to their implications for small-scale household pig producers compared to larger-scale commercial pig producers in Vietnam. It is noted that the current protection of Vietnam’s pig industry is not entirely based on preference for pork from local breeds of pigs but arises for other reasons. Some consideration is given to whether the natural protection of Vietnam’s pig industry will change in the future.

40|$|Dissolved {{organic carbon}} (DOC) {{is a key}} {{component}} of the global carbon cycle, but, to date, large uncertainties still exist on its source and fate in first-order streams. In a 23 ha rangeland and steep-slope headwater of South Africa, our aim was to quantify the contribution of overland flow (OF), soil water (SW) and ground water (GW) to DOC fluxes (DOCF), and to interpret the results in terms of DOC sources and fate. The average 2010 - 2011 DOC concentration (DOCC) at the catchment outlet was 4. 7 mg C l(- 1) with a standard error of +/- 2. 5 mg C l(- 1), which was significantly lower than in SW (15. 2 +/- 1. 6 mg C l(- 1)) and OF (11. 9 +/- 0. 8 mg C l(- 1)), but higher than in GW (2. 3 +/- 0. 6 mg C l(- 1)). Based on end-member mixing using Si and Na concentration in the water compartments, the average SW contribution to DOCF was 66. 4 %, followed by OF (30. 0 %) and GW (3. 6 %). The resulting estimated DOCF at the catchment outlet was 8. 05 g C m(2) y(- 1). This was much higher than the observed value of 2. 80 g C m(2) y(- 1), meaning that 5. 25 g C m(2) y(- 1) or 65 % of the DOC is lost during its downslope and/or downstream transport to the catchment <b>outlet.</b> <b>Complementary</b> investigations revealed that the DOCC in SW dropped from 15. 2 +/- 1. 6 to 2. 6 +/- 0. 3 mg C l(- 1) during its downslope transport to the river system, which corresponded to a net loss of 5. 10 g C m(2) y(- 1), or 97 % of the catchment DOC losses. These results on DOC sources and potential fate in headwaters are expected to improve our understanding of the impact of hydrology on the global C-cycle...|$|R
40|$|Antitrust law {{has three}} main targets: collusion, mergers and monopolization. The first two are {{relatively}} uncontroversial targets. While specific facts and theories may be disputed, e. g., {{how easy it}} is for new competitors to enter a particular market, the overall rationales for these doctrines are widely accepted. Monopolization law, originating in Section 2 of the 1890 Sherman Act, is notoriously different. The largest, longest, and most hotly disputed cases in recent years, such as the government's lawsuits against AT&T and Microsoft, concerned monopolization. The intensity of the dispute is no accident. Unlike other branches of antitrust, which target decisions by firms not to compete with each other, monopolization is portrayed as a dominant firm protecting itself by harming nascent rivals. Since the competitive process itself, offering more and better products at lower prices'also harms rivals, antitrust observers fall into two warring camps. Skeptics argue that because monopolization tactics are likely to be confused with competition that could be good for consumers, Section 2 cases should bear very high if not insurmountable burdens of proof. Activists, on the other hand, believe that one can protect competition by protecting some competitors against the actions of another. The focus on protecting rivals makes Section 2 not just controversial; it has led to legal requirements that make little economic sense. One such requirement, prior dominance, paradoxically asserts that one cannot monopolize without already having a monopoly. This conflates the nature of the offender with the nature of the offense and undercuts claims that alleged abuses have competitive relevance. Another requirement, profit sacrifice, states that practices cannot be anticompetitive unless they cause the perpetrator short-run losses. This requirement, confusing intent with effect, is neither necessary nor sufficient for economic harm. No one would argue that mergers or collusion should be stopped only if those undertaking them were losing money. We could limit the controversy and avoid these spurious requirements if monopolization law can be recast to make it more like the less controversial branches of collusion and merger law. This entails rejecting the focus on rivals and instead treating Section 2 cases as about monopolization of otherwise competitive complementary markets, e. g., in production inputs, distribution channels, or retail <b>outlets.</b> <b>Complementary</b> market monopolization (CMM) is necessary and sufficient for anticompetitive harm. It would allow courts to eliminate dubious requirements and adopt widely accepted tools from other areas of antitrust, e. g., merger guidelines. CMM provides a way to assess exclusionary tactics such as bundled discounts and predatory pricing, bringing to light important and neglected differences between cases regarding direct harms and those based on indirect strategic effects. Moving to CMM could be effected by deleting,or maintain, from the "create or maintain a monopoly" definition of monopolization in Section 2 law. Technology and Industry, Regulatory Reform...|$|R
