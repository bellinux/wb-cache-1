5|$|The hoof of {{the horse}} {{contains}} over a dozen different structures, including bones, cartilage, tendons and tissues. The coffin or pedal bone is the major hoof bone, supporting {{the majority of the}} weight. Under the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> is the navicular bone, itself cushioned by the navicular bursa, a fluid-filled sac. The digital cushion is a blood vessel-filled structure located {{in the middle of the}} hoof, which assists with blood flow throughout the leg. At the top of the hoof wall is the corium, tissue which continually produces the horn of the outer hoof shell, which is in turn protected by the periople, a thin outer layer which prevents the interior structures from drying out. The wall is connected to the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> by sensitive laminae, a flexible layer which helps to suspend and protect the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone.</b> The main tendon in the hoof is the deep digital flexor tendon, which connects to the bottom of the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone.</b> The impact zone on the bottom of the hoof includes the sole, which has an outer, insensitive layer and a sensitive inner layer, and the frog, which lies between the heels and assists in shock absorption and blood flow. The final structures are the lateral cartilages, connected to the upper <b>coffin</b> <b>bone,</b> which act as the flexible heels, allowing hoof expansion. These structures allow the hoof to perform many functions. It acts as a support and traction point, shock absorber and system for pumping blood back through the lower limb.|$|E
25|$|Knowledge of equine forelimb anatomy is {{especially}} useful for understanding navicular syndrome. The navicular bone lies behind the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> {{and under the}} small pastern bone. The deep digital flexor (DDF) tendon runs {{down the back of}} the cannon and soft tissue in that area and under the navicular bone before attaching {{to the back of the}} <b>coffin</b> <b>bone.</b> The DDF tendon flexes the coffin joint, and the navicular bone acts as a fulcrum that the DDF tendon runs over.|$|E
25|$|The SDFT {{branches}} at the fetlock, {{creating a}} sling under {{the back of}} the joint. Thus, overextension of the fetlock is more likely to overstretch the SDFT than the DDFT, which simply travels straight down behind the fetlock and pastern, to attach to the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone.</b>|$|E

60|$|The heel of {{the horse}} is the part {{commonly}} known as the hock. The hinder cannon bone answers to the middle metatarsal bone of the human foot, the pastern, coronary, and <b>coffin</b> <b>bones,</b> to the middle toe bones; the hind hoof to the nail; as in the fore-foot. And, as in the fore-foot, there are merely two splints to represent the second and the fourth toes. Sometimes a rudiment of a fifth toe appears to be traceable.|$|R

25|$|The {{navicular bone}} is {{supported}} by several ligaments above, below, and on the side. One of these ligaments is the impar ligament, which attaches the navicular bone to the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> (distal phalanx). Cartilage lies between the navicular bone and the coffin joint, {{as well as between}} the navicular bone and the DDF tendon. The navicular bursa - a small sac that protects the DDF and navicular bone from abrasion as the tendon slides over the area - lies between the navicular bone and the DDF tendon.|$|E
25|$|Before {{beginning}} to shoe, the farrier removes the old shoe using pincers (shoe pullers) and trims the hoof {{wall to the}} desired length with nippers, a sharp pliers-like tool, and the sole and frog of the hoof with a hoof knife. Shoes do not allow the hoof to wear down as it naturally would in the wild, and it can then become too long. The <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> inside the hoof should line up straight with both bones in the pastern. If the excess hoof is not trimmed, the bones will become misaligned, which would place stress on {{the legs of the}} animal.|$|E
500|$|After {{about three}} days, {{he seemed to}} be feeling better; his blood work became normal and his {{diarrhea}} cleared up, but he still had low-grade fevers. Against the odds, his hoof X-rays came back showing no separation of the laminae, and no rotation or sinking of the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> in any of his feet. [...] Although the cryotherapy had not prevented laminitis, it might have kept it from becoming worse. On September 21, the casts were removed from his legs. [...] The laminitis treatment was successful and his feet were returning to normal, raising hopes that he could race again some day.|$|E

40|$|This study {{consisted}} {{in analyzing}} the asymmetry between bilateral third phalanges (<b>coffin</b> <b>bones)</b> in cold-blood horses based on the angle range of the plantar margin of the bone. The study employed a scanner projecting a hybrid set of images, consisting of sinusoidal stripes preceded by a Gray code sequence. As it turned out, three-dimensional scanning {{can be used to}} effectively determine the angle range for a selected portion of the studied bone. This provides broad possibilities for osteometric studies, as it enables the determination of angle distribution in a given fragment. The results obtained indicate a weak correlation between age and bilateral third-phalanx asymmetry in terms of the angle range of the plantar margins and no correlation between body weight and the asymmetry described...|$|R

500|$|The {{anatomy of}} the forelegs begin at the scapula. This is the {{shoulder}} in which provides the ease of movement as it is connected to various bones surrounding it such as the cervical vertebra (a section of the spine). The next bone is the humerus which leads onto the radius below. The radius is then connected to {{the bones of the}} knee. The carpus is located at front of the knee and the pisiform is the back of the knee. Below the knee is the cannon bone which is also known as the 3rd metacarpal. 55 million years ago when the Eohippus existed, the cannon bone used to be the 3rd toe of the foot. It's fusion took place in order to increase height and power of the limb. Behind the cannon bone are the splint bones. The splint bones are also known as the 2nd and 4th metacarpal and fused 25 - 35 million years ago {{during the time of the}} Miohippus. They provide extra strength and support of the cannon bone and used to be the 2nd and 4th toes of the foot. Below the cannon bone is the fetlock joint in which lays a structure if many bones. Firstly are the sesamoid bones that act as part of the system that allows the leg to drop as pressure is applied and spring back up as pressure is released. Below this is the proximal phalanx also known as the long pastern which is followed by the middle phalanx (short pastern). Below these bones are the navicular bone and the distal phalanx. the distal phalanx can be known as the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> or the pedal bone. Below the navicular bone is the navicular bursa.|$|E
2500|$|Ringbone can be {{classified}} by its location, with [...] "high ringbone" [...] occurring on {{the lower part of}} the large pastern bone or the upper part of the small pastern bone. [...] "Low ringbone" [...] occurs on {{the lower part of the}} small pastern bone or the upper part of the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone.</b> High ringbone is easier seen than low ringbone, as low ringbone occurs in the hoof of the horse. However, low ringbone may be seen if it becomes serious, as it creates a bony bump on the coronet of the horse.|$|E
2500|$|The hoof {{is made up}} by {{an outer}} part, the hoof [...] capsule (composed of various {{cornified}} specialized structures) and an inner, living part, containing soft tissues and bone. The cornified material of the hoof capsule is different in structure and properties in different parts. Dorsally, it covers, protects and supports P3 (also known as the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone,</b> pedal bone, PIII). Palmarly/plantarly, it covers and protects specialised soft tissues (tendons, ligaments, fibro-fatty and/or fibrocartilaginous tissues and cartilage). The upper, almost circular limit of the hoof capsule is the coronet (coronary band), having an angle to the ground of roughly similar magnitude in each pair of feet (i.e. fronts and backs). These angles may differ slightly from one horse to another, but not markedly. The walls originate from the coronet band. Walls are longer in the dorsal portion of the hoof (toe), intermediate in length in the lateral portion (quarter) and very short in palmar/plantar portion (heel). Heels are separated by an elastic, resilient structure named the 'frog'. [...] In the palmar/plantar part of the foot, above the heels and the frog, there are two oval bulges named the 'bulbs'.|$|E

A small graveyard east of the church, in which excavations have unveiled remains of <b>coffins</b> and <b>bones,</b> {{is said to have}} been ravaged by King Gustav Vasa who was looking for raw material for his saltpetre production, a deed commented in the chronicles as Ej är kristeligt i väder så skjuta sina förfäder ("Not Christian is public thus shoot/push one's ancestors").|$|R
50|$|It {{is thought}} that a church may have existed on this site {{at the time of}} the Norman conquest. The tower and parts of the present church date from the early 16th century. The church was {{restored}} and largely remodelled in 1869-70 by John Douglas. During this time the remains of an earlier church which had been destroyed by fire were discovered. Also discovered were a skeleton of a large man outside the north wall and a <b>coffin</b> containing <b>bones</b> under the floor of the church.|$|R
2500|$|The third phalanx (coffin bone; pedal bone; P3;) is {{completely}} (or almost completely) {{covered by the}} hoof capsule. It has a crescent shape and a lower cup-like concavity. Its external surface mirrors the wall's shape. The corium, a dermo-epidermal, highly vascularized layer between {{the wall and the}} <b>coffin</b> <b>bone,</b> has a parallel, laminar shape, and is named the laminae. Laminar connection has {{a key role in the}} strength and the health of the hoof. Beneath the rear part of the sole, there is the digital cushion, which separates the frog and the bulb from underlying tendons, joints and bones, providing cushioning protection. In foals and yearlings, the digital cushion is composed of fibro-fatty, soft tissue. In the adult horse, it hardens into a fibrocartilaginous tissue when sufficient, consistent concussion stimulates the back of the hoof. Normal transformation of the digital cushion into fibrocartilagineous tissue is now considered a key goal, both for prevention of, and for rehabilitation of recovering cases of navicular syndrome [...] The flexor tendon lays deeper, just along the posterior surface of the small pastern bone (PII) and navicular bone, and it connects with posterior surface of P3; the navicular functions as a pulley.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>coffin</b> <b>bone,</b> {{also known}} as the pedal bone (U.S.), is the bottommost bone in the equine leg and is encased by the hoof capsule. Also known as the distal phalanx, third phalanx, or [...] "P3". The <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> meets the short pastern bone or second phalanx at the coffin joint. [...] The <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> is {{connected}} to the inner wall of the horse hoof by a structure called the laminar layer. The insensitive laminae coming in from the hoof wall connects to the sensitive laminae layer, containing the blood supply and nerves, which is attached to the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone.</b> The lamina is a critical structure for hoof health, therefore any injury to the hoof or its support system can in turn affect the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "What is {{commonly}} called the knee {{of a horse}} is its wrist. The [...] 'cannon bone' answers to the middle bone of the five metacarpal [...] bones which support the palm of the hand in ourselves. The [...] pastern, coronary, and <b>coffin</b> <b>bones</b> of veterinarians answer to [...] the joints of our middle fingers, while the hoof is simply a [...] greatly enlarged and thickened nail. But if what lies below the [...] horse's 'knee' thus corresponds to the middle finger in [...] ourselves, what has become of the four other fingers or digits? [...] We find in the places of the second and fourth digits only two [...] slender splintlike bones, about two-thirds {{as long as the}} cannon [...] bone, which gradually taper to their lower ends and bear no [...] finger joints, or, as they are termed, phalanges. Sometimes, [...] small bony or gristly nodules are to be found at the bases of [...] these two metacarpal splints, and it is probable that these [...] represent rudiments of the first and fifth toes. Thus, the part [...] of the horse's skeleton which corresponds with that of the human [...] hand, contains one overgrown middle digit, and at least two [...] imperfect lateral digits; and these answer, respectively, to the [...] third, the second, and the fourth fingers in man.|$|R

5000|$|Naked Foal Syndrome or Hairless Foal Syndrome is {{believed}} to be a monogenic autosomal, lethal recessive gene in the Akhal-Teke breed. Foals with this condition have been reported since 1938. Research at the University of Bern in Switzerland is ongoing to develop a DNA test for the condition. [...] It appears to be similar in clinical signs, though not identical to, junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) found in the Belgian horse and another condition of a similar nature identified in the American Saddlebred. The defect causes foals to be born without any hair coat, mane or tail. In some cases, the front teeth are in at birth or molars grow abnormally from normal jaws. Other symptoms include persistent diarrhea, frequent digestive disorders, and laminitis-like, treatment-resistant rotation of the <b>coffin</b> <b>bones</b> in the hooves. Due the lack of normal skin protection, secondary symptoms include scaly, dry, and inflamed skin, as well as severe cases of sunburn in summer, and frequent pulmonary infections during winter. NFS is always fatal, most foals die within weeks of birth, although some horses have survived up to the age of two years. Early demise is usually caused by digestive problems, whereas older horses need to be humanely euthanized because of severe laminitis-induced pain. Some carriers have been identified, including 943 Arslan, 736 Keymir, 2001 Mariula, or 1054 Gilkuyruk, but the estimated number of unknown cases is likely higher, as several Russian and Turkmenian breeders have acknowledged that NFS foals are often just reported as stillborn or aborted.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the {{protection}} {{provided by the}} hoof, the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> can be injured and fractured. [...] For example, inflammatory conditions such as laminitis may lead to rotation of the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> and associated permanent damage due to the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> pulling away from the hoof wall as the laminar layer tears apart. Pedal osteitis is another common inflammatory condition. Fractures can also occur to coffin bones and, depending on the fracture, can cause severe lameness. [...] Other conditions linked to the conformation of the horse, such as flexural contractures may also affect the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone.</b> For example, the coffin joint can become deformed and lead to changes of the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> within the hoof capsule if the horse has an untreated club foot. [...] Contracted heels can also affect {{the shape of the}} <b>coffin</b> <b>bone,</b> making it grow away from its normal, healthy shape. [...] X-rays can diagnose injury, determine the position of the bone, and verify the type of damage that may have been received. Once injured, remedial shoeing can help protect the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> from further trauma. Treatment of assorted disorders may also involve use of shoe pads, anti-inflammatory medication, and management changes.|$|E
50|$|The deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) {{runs down}} the back of the leg and {{attaches}} on the bottom surface of the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone.</b> Contraction of the deep digital flexor muscle will flex the digit. At rest, the DDFT applies a constant traction to the bottom surface of the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone,</b> which is counteracted by the laminae holding the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> to the hoof wall.|$|E
5000|$|The chronic phase occurs if {{damage to}} the {{lamellae}} is not controlled early in the process, so that the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> displaces. Changes that may occur include separation of the dermal and epidermal lamellae, lengthening of the dermal lamellae, and compression of the coronary and solar dermis. If laminitis is allowed to continue, long-term changes such as remodeling of the apex and distal border of the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> (so that a [...] "lip" [...] develops) and osteolysis of the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> can occur.|$|E

5000|$|Rotation is {{the most}} common form of displacement, and, in this case, the tip of the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> rotates downward. [...] The degree of {{rotation}} may be influenced by the severity of the initial attack and the time of initiation and aggressiveness of treatment. A combination of forces (e.g. the tension of the deep digital flexor tendon and the weight of the horse) result in the deep digital flexor tendon literally pulling the dorsal face of the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> away from the inside of the hoof wall, which allows the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone</b> to rotate. Also, ligaments attaching the collateral cartilages to the digit, primarily in the palmar portion of the foot, possibly contribute to a difference in support from front to back. The body weight of the animal probably contributes to rotation of the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone.</b> Rotation results in an obvious misalignment between PII (the short pastern bone) and PIII (the <b>coffin</b> <b>bone).</b> If rotation of the third phalanx continues, its tip can eventually penetrate the sole of the foot.|$|E
