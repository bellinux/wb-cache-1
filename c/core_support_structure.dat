It is supported on a <b>core</b> <b>support</b> <b>structure</b> which is also made of 316 L(N) SS. This assembly is immersed {{in a pool of}} sodium which acts as a coolant. If there is a direct contact between the grid plate and the flange of <b>core</b> <b>support</b> <b>structure,</b> self-welding takes place between them at the high operating temperature of SFR by a thin sheet of liquid sodium which gets into the gap between them as this sodium acts as a metallic gum. To avoid self-welding, the bottom plate of the grid plate is hardfaced with Colmonoy 5 by PTAW so that the direct contact between those two components is avoided. Due to the difference in coefficients of thermal expansion between the base metal and the coating, the interface is subjected to tensile force which may weaken the bonding strength between them at higher temperatures. Therefore, the weldment should be able to withstand the tensile force at higher operating temperatures for which hot tensile properties of the base metal and the weldment have been determined to study the compatibility between them after hardfacing for the reliable operation of SFR...|$|E

40|$|The {{double ended}} {{guillotine}} break leading to density-driven air ingress {{has been identified}} as a low probability yet high consequence event for Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR). The lower plenum of the VHTR contains the <b>core</b> <b>support</b> <b>structure</b> and is composed of graphite. During an air ingress event, oxidation of the graphite structure under high temperature conditions in an oxygen containing environment could degrade the integrity of the <b>core</b> <b>support</b> <b>structure.</b> Following this large break, air from the reactor containment will begin to enter the lower plenum via two mechanisms: diffusion or density driven stratified flow. The large difference in time scales between the mechanisms leads to the need to perform high fidelity experimental studies to investigate the dominant the air ingress mechanism. A scaled test facility has been designed and built that allows the acquisition of velocity measurements during stratification after a pipe break. A non-intrusive optical measurement technique provides full-field velocity measurements profiles of the two species Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The data allow a more developed understanding of the fundamental flow features, the development of improved models, and possible mitigation strategies in such a scenario. Two brine-water experiments were conducted with different break locations. Flow fronts were analyzed and findings concluded that the flow has a constant speed through the pipe after the initial lock exchange. The time in which the flow enters the lower plenum is an important factor because it provides the window of opportunity for mitigation strategies in an actual reactor scenario. For both cases the flow of the heavier density liquid (simulating air ingress from the reactor containment) from the pipe enters the reactor vessel in under 6 seconds. The diffusion velocity and heavy flow front of the stratified flow layer were compared for the SF 6 /He gas case. It is seen that the diffusion plays less of a role as the transport mechanism in comparison to the density-driven stratified flow since the velocity of the diffusion is two orders of magnitude smaller than the velocity of the stratified flow mechanism. This is the reason for the need for density-driven stratified flow investigations following a LOCA. These investigations provided high-quality data for CFD validation in order for these models to depict the basic phenomena occurring in an air ingress scenario...|$|E

Most {{of the components of}} SFR are made of 316 L(N) / 304 L(N) SS and they are in contact with the liquid-metal sodium which acts as a coolant. The peak operating temperature in SFR is 550 °C. However, the self-welding starts at 500 °C. To avoid self-welding and galling, hardfacing of the grid plate has become necessary. Nickel based cobalt-free colmonoy 5 has been identified as the hardfacing material due to its lower dose rate by Plasma Transferred Arc Welding (PTAW). This paper is concerned with the measurement and investigations {{of the effects of the}} residual stress generated due to thermal cycling on a scale-down physical model of the grid plate.

As molten material moves from the core region through the <b>core</b> <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> it may encounter conditions which will cause it to freeze in the region of the lower core plate, delaying its arrival to the vessel head. The timing of this arrival is significant to reactor safety, because during the time span for material relocation to the lower head, the core may be experiencing steam-limited oxidation. The time at which hot material arrives in a coolant-filled lower vessel head, thereby significantly increasing the steam flow rate through the core region, becomes significant to the progression and timing of a severe accident.

40|$|In {{connection}} with investigations on graphite corrosion during water ingress accidents in high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTR) experiments on the kinetics {{of the reaction}} of water vapor with HTR graphite are described. Two graphites were exarnined : the fuel element matrix material A 3 - 27 and V 483 -T 2 developed for <b>core</b> <b>support</b> <b>structures.</b> The experiments were {{carried out in the}} in-pore-diffusion controlled regime at total gas pressure between 3 and 55 bar. The results indicate that for V 483 -T 2 the pressure dependence of the reaction rate can be described fairly well by the 1 /√(p) -relation-relation. For matrix materials, however, this does not apply for the whole pressure range valid for water ingress accidents in an HTR. In the region where KNUDSEN-diffusion significantly influences the diffusion of the oxidants in the pore system of the graphite, an extrapolation of kinetic data which are rather easily measured at low pressures, is not valid. Such an extrapolation of low pressure data to pressures above approximately 15 bar would give values that are too low. This result is supported by calculations which were carried out using results of diffusion experiments on corroded graphites...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{activity}} is to provide simplified criteria {{which can be used}} in rapid feasibility assessments of the structural viability of very high temperature components in conceptual and early preliminary design phases for Generation IV reactors. The current criteria in ASME Code Section III, Subsection NH, hereafter referred to as NH, (and Code Case N- 201 for <b>core</b> <b>support</b> <b>structures)</b> are difficult and require a complex deconstruction of finite element analysis results for their implementation. Further, and most important, times, temperatures and some materials of interest to the very high temperature Generation IV components are not covered by the current provisions of NH. Future revisions to NH are anticipated that will address very high temperature Generation IV components and materials requirements but, until that occurs interim guidance is required for design activities to proceed. These simplified criteria are for design guidance and are not necessarily in rigorous compliance with NH methodology. Rather, the objective is for criteria which address the early design needs of very high temperature Generation IV components and materials. The intent is to provide simplified but not overly conservative design methods. When more rigorous criteria and methods are incorporated in NH, the degree of conservatism should obviously be reduced. These criteria are based on currently available information. Although engineering judgments {{have been made in the}} formulation of these criteria they are not intended to require additional development or testing prior to implementation as a tool for use in conceptual and early preliminary design. Appendices are provided herein that contain useful information.
