5|$|Astronomy and {{astrophysics}} {{have developed}} significant interdisciplinary links with other major scientific fields.

Astrostatistics is the application of statistics to astrophysics to the analysis of vast amount of observational astrophysical data.|$|E
5|$|The media {{tended to}} {{overlook}} the meaning behind Pussy Riot's feminism; the <b>cultural</b> <b>context</b> of it is vastly {{different from that of}} Western feminism. According to Elianna Kan in the American Reader, Pussy Riot's feminism focused on the repression of authoritarian regimes that created idealised ideas of sexism, sex and family life. Pussy Riot strove {{to make it clear that}} feminism in Russia was still an issue and that post-feminism had not been achieved.|$|E

5|$|Feminist {{views on}} {{sexuality}} vary, and have differed by historical period and by <b>cultural</b> <b>context.</b> Feminist attitudes to female sexuality {{have taken a}} few different directions. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in {{what came to be}} known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.|$|E
5|$|Motives for {{collection}} of articles, such as Tipu's Tiger, are seen by literary historian Barrett Kalter {{as having a}} social and <b>cultural</b> <b>context.</b> The {{collection of}} Western and Indian art by Tipu Sultan is seen by Kalter as motivated {{by the need to}} display his wealth and legitimise his authority over his subjects who were predominantly Hindu and did not share his religion, viz. Islam. In the case of the East India Company, collection of documents, artefacts and objet's d'art from India helped develop the idea of a subjugated Indian populace {{in the minds of the}} British people, the thought being that the possession of such objects of a culture represented understanding of, dominance over, and mastery of that culture.|$|E
5|$|The Demi-Virgin, {{like most}} of Hopwood's farces, was commercially successful, but had no lasting {{literary}} significance. Even as a popular entertainment, the play's appeal was limited by <b>cultural</b> <b>context.</b> Before World War I, in a time with more conservative sexual mores, the production {{would have been more}} likely to be suppressed. A decade later, the sexual attitudes conveyed in the play would be considered too unsophisticated for Broadway. As early as the end of 1921, Woods was suggesting a seven-year hiatus in the production of bedroom farces, saying the genre had become stale. In 1925, Hopwood confessed to the audience at another play that he thought The Demi-Virgin was boring and that he was tired of writing faddish entertainment. The play's script was never published and no movie adaptation was made.|$|E

5|$|When debates {{polarise}} between techniques, {{the methods}} are {{often referred to}} by a colour code, based on the colours of the bindings of the two volumes from the first Oxford Conference, where the approaches were first distinguished. Green (Old World) archaeoastronomers rely heavily on statistics and are sometimes accused of missing the <b>cultural</b> <b>context</b> of what is a social practice. Brown (New World) archaeoastronomers in contrast have abundant ethnographic and historical evidence and {{have been described as}} 'cavalier' on matters of measurement and statistical analysis. Finding a way to integrate various approaches has been a subject of much discussion since the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Ripostes, {{published}} in October 1912, begins Pound's shift toward minimalist language. Michael Alexander describes the poems as showing a greater concentration {{of meaning and}} economy of rhythm than his earlier work. It was published when Pound had just begun his move toward Imagism; his first {{use of the word}} Imagiste appears in his prefatory note to the volume. The collection includes five poems by Hulme and a translation of the 8th-century Old English poem The Seafarer, although not a literal translation. It upset scholars, as would Pound's other translations from Latin, Italian, French and Chinese, either because of errors or because he lacked familiarity with the <b>cultural</b> <b>context.</b> Alexander writes that in some circles, Pound's translations made him more unpopular than the treason charge, and the reaction to The Seafarer was a rehearsal for the negative response to Homage to Sextus Propertius in 1919. His translation from the Italian of Sonnets and ballate of Guido Cavalcanti was also {{published in}} 1912.|$|E

25|$|The {{theoretical}} {{study of}} mystical experience {{has shifted from}} an experiential, privatized and perennialist approach to a contextual and empirical approach. The experientalist approach sees mystical experience as a private expression of perennial truths, separate from its historical and <b>cultural</b> <b>context.</b> The contextual approach, which also includes constructionism and attribution theory, {{takes into account the}} historical and <b>cultural</b> <b>context.</b> Neurological research takes an empirical approach, relating mystical experiences to neurological processes.|$|E

40|$|Our study {{evaluates the}} {{dimensionality}} and equivalence of social trust across <b>cultural</b> <b>contexts,</b> using new data from Switzerland and the World Values Survey 2005 – 2008. Whereas some scholars assert that trust {{should be regarded}} as a coherent concept, others claim that trust is better conceived of as a multidimensional concept. In contrast to the conventional dichotomy of the forms of social trust, we identify three distinct forms of trust, namely, particularized, generalized, and identity-based trust. Moreover, we dispute the view that respondents understand the wording of survey questions regarding social trust differently between different <b>cultural</b> <b>contexts,</b> which would imply that comparative research on trust is a pointless endeavor. Applying multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis to the various constructs of social trust, we conclude that one may study relationships among the three forms of trust and other theoretical constructs as well as compare latent means across <b>cultural</b> <b>contexts.</b> Our analyses therefore provide an optimistic outlook for future comparative analyses that investigate forms of social trust across <b>cultural</b> <b>contexts...</b>|$|R
