500|$|Like its predecessor, a {{great deal}} of {{merchandise}} was produced to help market the release of the game. Square Enix released two products to coincide with the release of the video game. The first was a limited edition Kingdom Hearts Game Boy Advance SP set released only in Japan. The set contained the game, a [...] "Kingdom deep silver" [...] GBA SP with the Kingdom Hearts logo, and a <b>carrying</b> <b>strap.</b> The second was a Kingdom Hearts trading card game produced by Tomy. The TCG featured starter decks, playing mats, and booster packs. Fantasy Flight Games later acquired the rights to market it to English-speaking countries. In 2007, a remake for the PlayStation 2, titled Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories was released along with Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix in a set, Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix+. A manga series ran in Monthly Shōnen Gangan in Japan, and was later released in the United States. It is accompanied by three novels—two set during Sora's storyline and the third during Reverse/Rebirth, Riku's story. Like with the Final Fantasy games and the first Kingdom Hearts game, Square released an Ultimania book on Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories following the release of the game. In North America, BradyGames released a strategy guide with a comprehensive walkthrough.|$|E

It may also have had a <b>carrying</b> <b>strap</b> (or baldric) as Thracian peltasts slung their shields on their backs when evading the enemy.

Ojo also had brought along his basket, to which Ozma had added a bottle of [...] "Square Meal Tablets" [...] and some fruit. But Jack Pumpkinhead grew {{a lot of things}} in his garden besides pumpkins, so he cooked for them a fine vegetable soup and gave Dorothy, Ojo and Toto, the only ones who found it necessary to eat, a pumpkin pie and some green cheese. For beds they must use the sweet dried grasses which Jack had strewn along one side of the room, but that satisfied Dorothy and Ojo very well. Toto, of course, slept beside his little mistress.|$|R
60|$|That {{night they}} {{procured}} some bladders, for although Jacob and Harry {{were able to}} swim, William Long could not do so, {{and in any case}} it was safer to float than to swim.

The three adventurers were then lowered from the wall by ropes, and having fastened the bladders around them, noiselessly entered the water. A numerous flotilla of ships and boats of the Commons lay below the town; the tide was running out, however, and the night dark, and keeping hold of each other, {{so as not to be}} separated by the tide, they drifted through these unobserved. Once safely out of hearing, Jacob and Harry struck out and towed their companion to shore.

They walked as far as Brentwood, where they stopped for a few days, and learned the news of what was passing throughout the country.|$|R
