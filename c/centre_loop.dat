5|$|All serpins share {{a common}} {{structure}} (or fold), despite their varied functions. All typically have three β-sheets (named A, B and C) and eight or nine α-helices (named hA–hI). The most significant regions to serpin function are the A-sheet and the reactive <b>centre</b> <b>loop</b> (RCL). The A-sheet includes two β-strands that are in a parallel orientation with a region between them called the 'shutter', and upper region called the 'breach'. The RCL forms the initial interaction with the target protease in inhibitory molecules. Structures have been solved showing the RCL either fully exposed or partially inserted into the A-sheet, and serpins {{are thought to be}} in dynamic equilibrium between these two states. The RCL also only makes temporary interactions {{with the rest of the}} structure, and is therefore highly flexible and exposed to the solvent.|$|E

Threonine and valine (also relatively small amino acids) are also abundant in these two kinds of peptides. Moreover, the known 3 D structures of an uncleaved serpin reactive centre and a fusion peptide are strikingly similar. Such sequences possess many small residues and are found in several signal peptides and in PrP, a protein associated with spongiform encephalopathies and resembling virus envelope proteins.

50|$|After the {{original}} IRT opened, the city began planning new lines. Two {{of these were}} extensions of that system, to Downtown Brooklyn and Van Cortlandt Park, but the other two - the <b>Centre</b> Street <b>Loop</b> Subway (or Brooklyn Loop Subway) and Fourth Avenue Subway (in Brooklyn) - were separate lines for which construction had not progressed as far. The <b>Centre</b> Street <b>Loop,</b> approved on January 25, 1907 as a four-track line (earlier proposed as two tracks), was to connect the Brooklyn Bridge, Manhattan Bridge, and Williamsburg Bridge via Centre Street, Canal Street, and Delancey Street. An extension south from the Brooklyn Bridge under William Street to Wall Street was {{also part of the}} plan, as were several loops towards the Hudson River and a loop connecting the bridges through Brooklyn. Construction contracts for the main line in Manhattan were awarded in early 1907, despite no determination of the operator once completed.

40|$|Context. Collective {{oscillations}} {{of two or}} more coronal magnetic loops {{are observed}} very often. Aims. We study the eigenmodes of oscillations of a system consisting of two parallel magnetic loops. Methods. The linearised MHD equations for a cold plasma are solved analytically in bicylindrical coordinates using the longwavelength approximation. A dispersion equation determining the frequencies of eigenmodes is derived and solved analytically. Results. Two solutions of the dispersion relation were found. The higher frequency corresponds to the antisymmetric mode polarised in the direction parallel to the line connecting the <b>loop</b> <b>centres,</b> and the symmetric mode polarised in the perpendicular direction. Depending on the polarisation of modes corresponding to the lower frequency, the systems of two parallel loops are classified as standard and anomalous. In standard systems the lower frequency corresponds to the symmetric mode polarised in the direction parallel to the line connecting the <b>loop</b> <b>centres,</b> and the antisymmetric mode polarised in the perpendicular direction. In anomalous systems the lower frequency corresponds to the antisymmetric mode polarised in the direction parallel to the line connecting the <b>loop</b> <b>centres,</b> and the symmetric mode polarised in the perpendicular direction. The limiting case of two identical loops is studied. The results for this case are compared with recent numerical results...|$|R
