500|$|In 1930, Columbus Marion Joiner, a self-educated prospector, {{discovered}} the East Texas Oil Field, the largest oil discovery {{that had ever}} been made. Because East Texas had not been significantly explored for oil before then, numerous independent prospectors, known as [...] "wildcatters", were able to purchase tracts of land to exploit the new field. This new oil field helped to revive Dallas's economy during the Great Depression, but sharply decreased interest in West Texas as the new supply led to another major drop in oil prices. The uncontrolled production in the eastern field destabilized the state's oil industry, which {{had been trying to}} control production levels to stabilize prices. Overproduction in East Texas was so great that then-governor Ross Sterling attempted to shut down many of the wells. During one of the forced closures, he ordered the Texas National Guard to enforce the shutdown. These efforts at <b>controlling</b> <b>production,</b> intended to protect both the independent operators and the major producers, were largely unsuccessful at first and led to widespread oil smuggling. In the later 1930s, the federal government intervened and brought production to sustainable levels, leading to a stabilization of price fluctuation. The income provided by the stabilization allowed less populated West Texas and the Panhandle to be more fully explored and exploited.|$|E

50|$|The Professional-Managerial {{class was}} an {{influential}} New Class hypothesis in social {{science in the}} United States in the 1970s by John and Barbara Ehrenreich. The Ehrenreichs hypothesized a social class within capitalism that, by <b>controlling</b> <b>production</b> processes through superior management skills, was neither proletarian nor bourgeois.

According {{to the most recent}} history of the Emergency in Ireland (Bryce Evans' 'Farewell to Plato's Cave', 2014) Seán Lemass, Minister for Supplies, introduced full rationing in Ireland 'too late', ensuring the black market trumped later state attempts at equitable distribution amid the British wartime supply squeeze. This view is contested by earlier histories which point to Lemass's successes in stockpiling essential goods.|$|E
50|$|Studies have {{suggested}} {{that most of the}} genes controlling male courtship signals are inherited as a co-adapted gene complex on the X-chromosome. The X-chromosome carries most of the genes <b>controlling</b> <b>production</b> of 13-methyl heptacosane, the main component of pheromones involved in sexual selection, and the ultraviolet wing reflectance pattern. Expression of the ultraviolet wing reflectance pattern found in male C. eurytheme is controlled by a recessive allele on the X-chromosome.

50|$|The V617F {{mutation}} to the JAK2 {{protein is}} found in approximately half of individuals with primary myelofibrosis. The V617F mutation is a change of valine to phenylalanine at the 617 position. Janus kinases (JAKs) are non-receptor tyrosine kinases essential for the activation of signaling that is mediated by cytokine receptors lacking catalytic activity. These include receptors for erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, most interleukins and interferon. JAK2 mutations are significant because JAK2 {{plays a role in}} <b>controlling</b> <b>production</b> of blood cells from hematopoietic stem cells. The V617F mutation appears to make hematopoietic cells more sensitive to growth factors that need JAK2 for signal transduction, which include erythropoietin and thrombopoietin.|$|E

50|$|With the {{founding}} of Remote <b>Control</b> <b>Productions</b> in 1981, Michael Laub proceeded to take his work somewhat closer to theater. Influenced by various forms, ranging from soap operas to classic literature and dance, his output as director of Remote <b>Control</b> <b>Productions</b> currently stands at over twenty plays. In what is perhaps something of an oversimplification of his extensive body of work, one can divide the material by three thematic approaches; the musical (Rough, Solo, Daniel and the Dancers, Total Masala Slammer); classic literature (Frank Wedekind's Lulu, Frankula, The Hans Christian Andersen Project); and portrait work (Portraits 360 Seconds, Out of Sorts, Alone/Gregoire, and The Biography Remix with Marina Abramović). One constant, since Rewind Song in 1989, has been the collaboration between Remote <b>Control</b> <b>Productions</b> and musician Larry Steinbachek, formerly of the band Bronski Beat.|$|R

50|$|Reducing the {{batch size}} in {{discrete}} manufacturing {{is therefore a}} desirable goal: it improves the speed of response to the customer, whilst improving the ratio of value-added to non value-added work. However, it should be balanced against the finite capacity of resources at the value-adding processes. Capacity is consumed by changeover whenever a process is required to perform work on a different part or product model than the preceding one. Time consumed in changeover is also considered waste, and it reduces the amount of resource capacity that is available to perform value-adding work. Reducing batch sizes can also increase handling time, risk and complexity in planning and <b>controlling</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Osborne and Macfarlane {{became the}} joint {{managing}} directors with Osborne <b>controlling</b> <b>production</b> and Macfarlane controlling marketing. Sites for the factory were examined, with Burton Latimer in Northamptonshire eventually being chosen, {{due in part}} to the offer of a disused flour mill by a Mr. George, who requested shares in the Company and who was subsequently offered a seat on the existing board of directors. In 1933, Macfarlane left the Company to pursue other business interests, leaving Osborne as the sole managing director. George eventually became chairman of the board. Osborne sold his shareholding to the directors in July 1936, at which time the Company was renamed [...] "Weetabix Limited." ...|$|E
5000|$|This {{level of}} {{organization}} to production, with one trading house (in effect, one company) <b>controlling</b> <b>production,</b> transportation, and sales, was unprecedented in Japan, and can easily {{been seen as}} the forerunner to the factory system, economic and industrial modernization, {{and the rise of}} the zaibatsu (Japanese monopolies). One of the key differences, organizationally, however, between the ie and the zaibatsu which would come later is that the ie always focused on producing and selling only one or two types of goods; so-called [...] "horizontal zaibatsu" [...] would seek to deal in many unrelated types of goods. For example, today, Mitsubishi is both an automobile company and a bank.|$|E

50|$|Martin Alper, who had {{the most}} {{marketing}} flair, went to the United States in 1986 to set up Mastertronic Inc. The UK company was managed by Frank Herman, whilst Alan Sharam increasingly specialised in sales and logistics (warehousing, packaging, <b>controlling</b> <b>production</b> schedules). As the business continued to grow Mastertronic created another label in 1986 - 'Entertainment USA', when it began working closely with several American writers, including Sculptured Software and Randall Masteller. They wanted an outlet to sell games to the UK market, and so Mastertronic moved in, often using Rob Hubbard or David Whittaker to re-do the music. Soon afterwards, this name was used by Woolworths as the new name for their wholesale business.|$|E
50|$|The glaze texture on {{this new}} Fiesta is very smooth, hard and much shinier than the {{original}} Fiesta. Since its introduction, new Fiesta has remained popular. In addition, it has increased collector interest in all the lines. Many people are collecting vintage pieces, as well as purchasing new items from department stores and catalog retailers. Fiesta collectors often add this new ware to existing collections of vintage Fiesta, while others concentrate on buying from the new assortment. Early in Fiesta's second incarnation, the Homer Laughlin Company marketed it as a new collectible. The manufacturer has maintained interest in Fiesta and manipulated the collectors' market over the past 20 years by discontinuing glaze colors, and by limiting production quantities on some items, or <b>controlling</b> <b>production</b> time frames. Similar techniques {{have been used by}} numerous other housewares, china, silver, toy, ornament, etc. companies.|$|E
50|$|The second {{dimension}} is achieving low {{direct and indirect}} operating costs. This is achieved by offering high volumes of standardized products, offering basic no-frills products and limiting customization and personalization of service. Production costs are kept low by using fewer components, using standard components, and {{limiting the number of}} models produced to ensure larger production runs. Overheads are kept low by paying low wages, locating premises in low rent areas, establishing a cost-conscious culture, etc. Maintaining this strategy requires a continuous search for cost reductions in all aspects of the business. This will include outsourcing, <b>controlling</b> <b>production</b> costs, increasing asset capacity utilization, and minimizing other costs including distribution, R&D and advertising. The associated distribution strategy is to obtain the most extensive distribution possible. Promotional strategy often involves trying to make a virtue out of low cost product features.|$|E
