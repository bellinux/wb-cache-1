40|$|Background: Protein-containing {{recovery}} beverages {{are proposed}} {{to support an}} athlete's recovery from exercise through stimulation of insulin release, promoting the restoration of muscle glycogen stores, and stimulation of protein synthesis and muscle protein restoration. Objective: The present study aimed to determine, (1) {{whether there is an}} insulinotropic effect of whey proteins, when consumed in addition to carbohydrate, which is assumed to enhance muscle glycogen resynthesis and (2) whether a blend of hydrolysate and intact protein, when consumed in addition to carbohydrate, will enhance the athlete's recovery from exercise. Design: Twelve trained top level cyclists repeated a protocol on four consecutive weeks, during which either a control beverage (<b>Carb)</b> or three beverages containing whey protein (carbohydrate and intact protein (<b>Carb</b> + I); carbohydrate and protein hydrolysate (<b>Carb</b> + H; carbohydrate and intact protein : protein hydrolysate mix (<b>Carb</b> + M)) were consumed during recovery from exhaustive endurance exercise. The beverages were formulated to supply 1. 2 g/kg/hour carbohydrate and 0. 4 g/kg/hour protein. Subjects followed a controlled diet two days before each experimental day. On the experimental day the athletes each performed a glycogen-depleting exercise programme, then received the designated dietary beverage every 30 minutes for the first two hours post-exercise. The progress of recovery was monitored via the measurement of cardiovascular recovery, and the appearance and relative concentration of metabolites in blood (15 samples over a four hour period, obtained via an indwelling cannula) and urine samples (13 samples over a seven hour period) collected sequentially during the post-exercise recovery period. Results: Plasma albumin concentrations were significantly lower following consumption of beverages containing whey protein (<b>Carb</b> + H, p< 0. 01; <b>Carb</b> + M, p< 0. 05) compared to that observed with the <b>Carb</b> beverage. Urine output was significantly higher after consumption of the <b>Carb</b> beverage than with any of the three-protein containing beverages (<b>Carb</b> + I, p< 0. 01; <b>Carb</b> + H, p< 0. 05; <b>Carb</b> + M, p< 0. 05) during the period of controlled fluid consumption. Heart rate recovery was found to be significantly greater following consumption of the three protein-containing beverages (<b>Carb</b> + I, p< 0. 001; <b>Carb</b> + M, p< 0. 001, <b>Carb</b> + H, p< 0. 01) than following consumption of the <b>Carb</b> beverage. The <b>Carb</b> + M beverage produced increased heart rate recovery (p< 0. 001) compared to that observed following consumption of the other two protein-containing beverages (<b>Carb</b> + I, <b>Carb</b> + H). Following correction of the data for haematocrit, to account for the hydration status of the athletes, a significant difference (p< 0. 05) in the ratio of plasma insulin to plasma glucose concentrations was found following consumption of any of beverages containing whey protein (<b>Carb</b> + I, <b>Carb</b> + H, <b>Carb</b> + M) compared to that observed for the <b>Carb</b> beverage. Consumption of the <b>Carb</b> + I beverage resulted in significantly higher concentrations of urinary nitrogen excretion as urea (p< 0. 05) and ammonia (p< 0. 01), and significantly higher plasma concentrations of the amino acids Valine, Leucine, Isoleucine, Phenylalanine, Tryptophan, and Tyrosine (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: The addition of whey protein to a carbohydrate-containing beverage stimulated enhanced recovery from exercise. A major factor in the improved recovery was increased rehydration following consumption of the protein-containing beverages, mainly due to the high sodium content of these beverages. This increased rehydration was shown to influence results for plasma insulin and plasma glucose concentrations where, after accounting for the hydration status of athletes, a difference between consumption of the <b>Carb</b> beverage and that observed for any of the three protein-containing beverages was observed. The results also allude to a potential benefit of protein hydrolysates over intact protein on protein recovery. Consuming a protein mix (<b>Carb</b> + M) also appears to improve heart rate recovery compared to consuming either intact (<b>Carb</b> + I) or hydrolysed (<b>Carb</b> + H) proteins individually. The results of this study highlight the importance of dietary protein on enhancing recovery from endurance exercise...|$|R

2500|$|Different anthropological {{or other}} sources have {{attempted}} to explain a possible ecological explanation {{of the need for}} human sacrifices to supplement overall Aztec diet. Harner’s main argument lies within his claim that cannibalism is needed to assist the diet of the Aztecs. He claimed that very high population pressure and an emphasis on maize agriculture, without domesticated herbivores, led to a deficiency of essential amino acids amongst the Aztecs. [...] As population increased and the amount of available game, mostly deer, decreased the Aztecs had to compete with other carnivorous mammals such as dogs, to find their food. In addition, the intensification of agriculture was believed to only help with gaining a surplus of <b>carbs</b> however not helpful with receiving proper nutrients. [...] Therefore, cannibalism of human sacrifices was needed to get the appropriate amount of protein per individual. Harris, author of Cannibals and Kings, has propagated the claim, originally proposed by Harner, that the flesh of the victims was a part of an aristocratic diet as a reward, since the Aztec diet was lacking in proteins.|$|E
40|$|The {{microstructural}} {{characteristics and}} amplitude dependences of the Young's modulus E and internal friction (logarithmic decrement delta) of biocarbon matrices prepared by beech wood carbonization at temperatures T (<b>carb)</b> = 850 - 1600 A degrees C {{in the presence}} of a nickel-containing catalyst have been studied. Using X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, it has been shown that the use of a nickel catalyst during carbonization results in a partial graphitization of biocarbons at T (<b>carb)</b> a parts per thousand yen 1000 A degrees C: the graphite phase is formed as 50 - to 100 -nm globules at T (<b>carb)</b> = 1000 A degrees C and as 0. 5 - to 3. 0 -mu m globules at T (<b>carb)</b> = 1600 A degrees C. It has been found that the measured dependences E(T (<b>carb))</b> and delta(T (<b>carb))</b> contain three characteristic ranges of variations in the Young's modulus and logarithmic decrement with a change in the carbonization temperature: E increases and delta decreases in the ranges T (<b>carb)</b> 1300 A degrees C; in the range 1000 < T (<b>carb)</b> < 1300 A degrees C, E sharply decreases and delta increases. The observed behavior of E(T (<b>carb))</b> and delta(T (<b>carb))</b> for biocarbons carbonized {{in the presence of}} nickel correlates with the evolution of their microstructure. The largest values of E are obtained for samples with T (<b>carb)</b> = 1000 and 1600 A degrees C. However, the samples with T (<b>carb)</b> = 1600 A degrees C exhibit a higher susceptibility to microplasticity due to the presence of a globular graphite phase that is significantly larger in size and total volume.

2500|$|In 1976, Guzzi {{released}} the 850 Le Mans, a cafe racer {{that was a}} stylistic masterpiece and still today {{considered one of the}} most iconic and sought-after of all Guzzis. A marketing success that would compete with other Italian superbikes, it spawned four later models from Mark II to its culmination in the 1990s, the Mark V. The initial model is known widely but incorrectly as the Mark I. Technically, it is simply the 850 Le Mans. It was named in homage to the 24-hour endurance race and circuit in France. The Mark I had two production runs with slight modifications. The first run, known as Series 1, used the roundish CEV stop/taillight used on many Italian bikes of the decade. Fewer than 2,000 of the round taillight bikes were made and they are the most desirable Guzzi of the era. The second production run, known as the Series 2 and totaling around 4,000 bikes, used a De Tomaso-designed rectangular taillight/reflector and modified rear guard. This was also used on the Mark II and SP models. The taillight and guard was the biggest change between Series 1 and 2 but other modifications included later inclusion of a tripmeter, black fork lowers, a more generous dual seat that replaced the split-prone original seat, exhaust pipe heel guards and inferior fuel taps. The extra cost compared to the [...] "cooking" [...] T3 model paid for performance items such as high-compression domed pistons, larger inlet and exhaust valves and Dell'Orto 36mm pumper <b>carbs</b> with filterless grey plastic velocity stacks.

40|$|Heart-healthy dietary {{recommendations}} include {{decreasing the}} intake of {{saturated fatty acids}} (SFA). However, the relative benefit of replacing SFA with monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), or carbohydrates (<b>CARB)</b> is still being debated. We have used two mouse models of atherosclerosis, low density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (LDLRKO) and apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoEKO) mice to measure the effects of four isocaloric diets enriched with either SFA, MUFA, PUFA, or <b>CARB</b> on atherosclerotic lesion area and lipoprotein levels. In LDLRKO mice, compared with the SFA diet, the MUFA and <b>CARB</b> diets significantly increased atherosclerosis in both sexes, but the PUFA diet had no effect. The MUFA and <b>CARB</b> diets also increased very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) in males and VLDL-C levels in females. Analysis of data from LDLRKO mice on all diets showed that atherosclerotic lesion area correlated positively with VLDL-C levels (males: r = 0. 47, P < 0. 005; females: r = 0. 52, P < 0. 001). In contrast, in apoEKO mice {{there were no significant}} dietary effects on atherosclerosis in either sex. Compared with the SFA diet, the <b>CARB</b> diet significantly decreased VLDL-C in males and the MUFA, PUFA, and <b>CARB</b> diets decreased VLDL-C and the <b>CARB</b> diet decreased LDL-C in females. In summary, in LDLRKO mice the replacement of dietary SFA by either MUFA or <b>CARB</b> causes a proportionate increase in both atherosclerotic lesion area and VLDL-C. There were no significant dietary effects on atherosclerotic lesion area in apoEKO mice. These results are surprising and suggest that, depending on the underlying genotype, dietary MUFA and <b>CARB</b> can actually increase atherosclerosis susceptibility, probably by raising VLDL-C levels through a non-LDL receptor, apoE-dependent pathway...|$|R
