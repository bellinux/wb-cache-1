On the outskirts of Gambut, the line was stopped to allow the Matilda tanks to lead the <b>column.</b> <b>C</b> Squadron was ordered to charge into Gambut, but when it became apparent that the Axis was retreating, they pursued until the New Zealand infantry engaged and then withdrew to Gambut aerodrome. The following evening, the squadron screened the 4th Brigade Group and advanced westward before being recalled at dusk. On 25 November, C Squadron screened the brigade in its advance on Sidi Rezegh and captured a number of German soldiers before being sent to guard divisional headquarters. Four Stuart tanks, captured from the British by the Germans and then recaptured, were given to C Squadron on the afternoon of 27 November.|$|E

The model was based on equilibrium equations on which load-bearing capacity of R. <b>C.</b> <b>column</b> at given time (year) can be predicted considering the overall deteriorations of rebar, concrete section, mechanical properties and bond behavior between corroded reinforcement and concrete. The model was verified by published literature test results of corroded R. <b>C.</b> <b>columns</b> served in atmosphere environment for years. The comparison of the model predictions with the test results shows the validity of the model. In the end, considerations for use of the model were suggested...|$|R
