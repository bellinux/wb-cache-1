Legislation officially designating the plot as a Pershing Square subsequently was adopted by Congress in 1957. Development of the square proved controversial, as different groups offered competing proposals for memorials to John J. Pershing, who had served as General of the Armies in World War I. These disagreements led to inaction, and by 1962 the square remained bare and often <b>cluttered</b> <b>with</b> trash.

25|$|The King's County coroner, Henry C. Simms, {{convened a}} jury on the {{disaster}} which heard testimony through December and January 1877. When {{it was published}} {{at the end of}} January 1877, it was especially harsh on the theatrical managers, Sheridan Shook and A. M. Palmer. The jury held Shook and Palmer responsible for failing to take adequate precautions against fire, failing to train stage hands in either fire prevention or the management of incipient fires, failing to establish clear chains of command in the theatre's management, permitting the stage to become <b>cluttered</b> <b>with</b> properties and failing to maintain in good working order fire fighting equipment and emergency exits that had originally been installed. The jury found lesser fault with the design of the building, observing that the five-year-old structure had better exits than many other public buildings in the city. Fault was found with the stairways leading to the family circle and the auditorium, which lacked a firewall between the audience and the stage. In delivering the verdict, the jury reported that death occurred mainly through suffocation in the dense smoke that prevailed in the gallery, likely in the few minutes after Charles Vine dropped from the family circle to the balcony below.|$|E

They had two children, Dermot (1912–1976) and Maeve Astrid (1913–1987). [...] Bax became known in Dublin literary circles under the pseudonym [...] "Dermot O'Byrne"; he mixed with the writer George William Russell and his associates, and published stories, verses and a play. Reviewing a selection of the prose and poetry reissued in 1980, Stephen Banfield found most of Bax's earlier poems [...] "like his early music, over-written, <b>cluttered</b> <b>with</b> the secondhand lumber of early Yeats, though the weakness is one of loosely chosen language rather than complexity." [...] Banfield had better things to say of the later poems, where Bax [...] "focuses matters, whether laconically and colloquially upon the grim futility of the 1916 Easter Uprising... or pungently upon his recurrent disillusionment about love." [...] Some of Bax's writings as O'Byrne were regarded as subversively sympathetic to the Irish republican cause, and the government censor prohibited their publication.|$|E
