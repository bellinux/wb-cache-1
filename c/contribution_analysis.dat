40|$|The {{artificial}} {{neural network}} (ANN) method has shown its superior predictive power compared to the conventional ap-proaches in many studies. However, {{it has always been}} treated as a “black box ” because it provides little explanation on the relative influence of the independent variables in the prediction process. In this study, the ANN method was used to develop empirical correlations for laminar and turbulent heat transfer in a horizontal tube under the uniform wall heat flux boundary condition and three inlet configurations (re-entrant, square-edged, and bell-mouth). The <b>contribution</b> <b>analysis</b> for the dimensionless variables was conducted using the index of contribution defined in this study. The relative importance of the independent variables appearing in the correlations was examined using the index of contribution based on the co-efficient matrices of the ANN correlations. For the turbulent heat transfer data, the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers were observed as the most important parameters, and the length-to-diameter and bulk-to-wall viscosity ratios were found to be the least important parameters. The method was extended to analyze the more complicated forced and mixed convection data in developing laminar flow. The dimensionless parameters influencing the heat transfer in this region were the Rayleigh number and the Graetz number. The <b>contribution</b> <b>analysis</b> clearly showed that the Rayleigh number has a significant in-fluence on the mixed convection heat transfer data, and the forced convection heat transfer data is more influenced by the Graetz number. The results of this study clearly indicated that the <b>contribution</b> <b>analysis</b> method can be used to provide correct physical insight into the influence of different variables or a combination of them on complicated heat transfer problems...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} body mass {{dynamics}} {{can be viewed}} as part of life history theory, but its potential has remained largely untapped {{due to a lack of}} analytical methodology. We therefore propose a method, called <b>contribution</b> <b>analysis,</b> which enables us to decompose a change in body mass into contributions associated with variations in individual egg mass, clutch size, and standard somatic mass (somatic mass adjusted to body length). The advantage of <b>contribution</b> <b>analysis</b> is that various contributions are expressed in the same units (units of mass) and show the amount of resources committed to changes in the individual traits, while the traits themselves are measured in different units and thus incomparable on their own. The method is tuned to study zooplankton, and is applied to examine body mass dynamics in Daphnia galeata. We found that when recovering from a poor-resource environment just above the threshold food concentration, Daphnia primarily increase their standard somatic mass, that is, restore body condition. When the trophic environment improves further but remains below the incipient limiting level, resources are invested equally to enhance body condition and reproduction in terms of clutch size. Finally, when food is no longer a limiting factor, almost all resources are committed to increase clutch size. While individual egg mass also varies, it never attracts more resources than the shift in the most prioritized trait. We suggest that the significance of this shift in resource allocation priorities is to keep an adult female alive in a poor environment and thus to allow her to retain her reproductive potential for better conditions in the future. <b>Contribution</b> <b>analysis</b> of body mass dynamics may allow us to detect flexible allocation strategies in a changing natural environment.

Wu Major:		Mechanical Engineering Degree:		Master of Science Panel <b>contribution</b> <b>analysis</b> is an {{effective}} tool to find the relative contributions of vibrating panels towards the sound pressure level at a field point inside an enclosure. This research work presents a newly developed panel <b>contribution</b> <b>analysis</b> technique using Helmholtz equation least squares (HELS) based near field acoustic Holography method. The proposed approach requires only one set of the acoustic pressures measured in the near field of a vibrating structure. Using these input data, the normal surface velocity and acoustic pressure are reconstructed, from which the normal acoustic intensity distribution is calculated. Next, the normal acoustic intensity is correlated to the acoustic pressure at any field point of interest. In this way, the relative contributions from individual panels toward acoustic radiation at any field point can be ranked and the critical panel(s) of a vibrating structure be identified. Numerical simulations and experimental validation using this approach for identifying critical panels inside an enclosure are presented to verify the proposed formulations...|$|E

40|$|For an {{experimental}} system of marine planktonic algae, U. Sommer {{has published a}} set of regression equations linking species diversity to intensity and frequency of disturbance. I apply a simple version of <b>contribution</b> <b>analysis</b> to Sommer's equations pursuing a twofold goal: (1) to reveal a mechanism responsible for changes in species diversity along the gradient of disturbance and (2) to evaluate {{the potential of the}} method used. The relative importance (i. e., contributions) of changes in disturbance intensity and frequency to the resultant change in diversity is estimated, as disturbance regime is gradually shifting from high frequencies and low intensities to low frequencies and high intensities. Changes in intensity are found to be of primary importance under a high-frequency and low-intensity disturbance regime, while changes in frequency are of primary importance under a low-frequency and high-intensity disturbance regime. Competitive interactions appear to shape the algal community {{at both ends of the}} disturbance gradient-not only when disturbances are weak though common, but also when they are strong and rare. The results suggest that <b>contribution</b> <b>analysis</b> may allow one to extract information on the underlying mechanisms from purely descriptive regression relationships...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Food {{frequency}} questionnaires (FFQ) {{are used}} for epidemiological studies. Because of the wide variations in dietary habits within different populations, a FFQ must be developed to suit the specific group. To date, no FFQ has been developed for Japanese children. In this study, we developed a FFQ to assess the regular dietary intake of Japanese children. The FFQ included questions regarding both individual food items and mixed dishes. Methods Children (3 - 11 years of age, n = 621) were recruited as subjects. Their parents or guardians completed a weighed dietary record (WDR) for each subject in one day. We defined FOOD {{to be not only}} as a single food item but also as a mixed dish. The dieticians conceptually grouped similar FOODs as FOOD types. We used a <b>contribution</b> <b>analysis</b> and a multiple regression analysis to select FOOD types. Results We obtained a total of 586 children's dietary data (297 boys and 289 girls). In addition, we obtained 1, 043 FOODs. Dieticians grouped into similar FOODs, yielding 275 FOOD types. A total of 115 FOOD types were chosen using a <b>contribution</b> <b>analysis</b> and a multiple regression analysis, then we excluded overlapping items. FOOD types that were eaten by fewer than 15 subjects were excluded; 74 FOOD types remained. We also added liver-based dishes that provided a high amount of retinol. A total of 75 FOOD types were finally determined for the FFQ. The frequency response formats were classified into four type categories: seven, eight, nine and eleven, according to the general intake frequency of each FOOD type. Information on portion size was obtained from the photographs of each listed FOOD type in real scale size, which was the average amount of the children's portion sizes. Conclusions Using both a <b>contribution</b> <b>analysis</b> and a multiple regression analysis, we developed a 75 -food item questionnaire from the study involving 586 children. The next step will involve the verification of FFQ reproducibility and validity. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of a final product {{can be regarded as}} the sum of the impacts of all processes needed to obtain it. The impacts of these processes in all individual layers of production can be quantified using <b>contribution</b> <b>analysis</b> methods. SPA is an advanced method used to identify the chain of production processes linking the most highly emitting process with the final product. This analysis was performed in Matlab, using a specialized algorithm developed by Peters and Hertwich in 1996. In this thesis we test an interdisciplinary approach combining LCA and operational research methods for doing a SPA. A mixed integer program was developed and implemented in Gams. The performance of this generalized algorithm was benchmarked against the specialized algorithm for three test cases performed on three databases of increasing complexity. The results suggest the advantage of this algorithm in performing analysis on sparse data systems compared with the classic method involving Matlab. However, Matlab 9 ̆ 2 s specialized algorithm performs better for dense data systems.

40|$|In this paper, we {{elaborate}} on the method of <b>contribution</b> <b>analysis</b> in relation to body mass dynamics which has been proposed recently (Polishchuk, Vijverberg, 2005. Oecologia. V. 144. P. 268 - 277). We suggest that <b>contribution</b> <b>analysis</b> as applied to body mass dynamics makes a bridge between production-energetic approach and life history theory. Production is conventionally divided into somatic and reproductive components, and our approach shows how to estimate the role (i. e. contributions) of these components in body mass dynamics. The pattern of contributions is further interpreted in terms of life history. The approach is applied to study body mass dynamics of the cladoceran Daphnia galeata in response to improving trophic conditions. The performance of the method is found {{to depend on the}} resolution of food concentrations, that is. on how many food concentrations are examined and how far they re spaced on the food concentration axis. When resolution is fine, a shift in res! ource allocation priorities is detected - from somatic component attracting more resources under harsh food conditions to reproduction attracting more resources under favorable conditions. However, when resolution is poor this pattern remains hidden. In that case, we observe roughly equal contributions of somatic and reproductive components to body mass dynamics. ...|$|E
