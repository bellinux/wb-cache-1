40|$|Tiny {{interstellar}} dust grains causing the polarization {{of light from}} the nearest stars are deflected sideways in the outer heliosheath regions, along with the interstellar magnetic field. Observations of optical polarization of stars beyond the heliosphere nose, and at distances 5 – 200 pc, suggest the direction of the upwind interstellar magnetic field is relatively constant. The polarization vectors indicate an orientation of the local interstellar magnetic field consistent with the position angle in galactic coordinates of PAG ∼ 40 ◦. This position angle is consistent with the offset between interstellar He o and H o flowing into the heliosphere, indicating that the interstellar magnetic field, BIS, is inclined by ∼ 55 ◦ and ∼ 65 ◦, respectively, with respect to the galactic and ecliptic planes. The heliosphere nose is towards Loop I, and if the expansion of Loop I distorted the interarm BIS close to the Sun then the local BIS is directed from southern to northern ecliptic latitudes. The hot and <b>cold</b> <b>poles</b> of the measured Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) dipole moment are nearly symmetric around the heliosphere nose direction, to within ∼ 5 ◦.

Part 2 Gravity wave forcing Gravity wave forcing (GWF) and the <b>cold</b> <b>pole</b> problem is potentially the most serious issue affecting highly temperature dependent processes such as PSC formation. However, it is not as serious an issue for the Arctic as is implied by the authors. The temperature biases of a range of CCMs are shown in Austin et al.

In the lower stratosphere the zonal average temperature does not necessarily give the whole picture as the biases are somewhat smaller (˜ 5 K). Here, tropospheric processes and the amplitudes of lower S 1073 stratospheric planetary waves could have a larger impact than GWF in producing local temperature variations which determine PSC areas.

The results are for a period around the austral winter solstice, and {{the emphasis is on}} the simulated Southern Hemisphere (SH) winter circulation. Comparisons are made with results obtained from lower horizontal resolution versions of the same model. The focus in this paper is on two particularly striking features of the high-resolution simulation: the extratropical surface winds and the winter polar middle atmospheric vortex. In the extratropical SH, the simulated surface westerlies and meridional surface pressure gradients in the high-resolution model are considerably stronger than observed and are stronger than those simulated at lower horizontal resolution. In the middle atmosphere, the high-resolution model produces a simulation of the zonal mean winter polar vortex that is considerably improved over that found with lower resolution models (although it is still significantly affected by the usual <b>cold</b> <b>pole</b> bias).

The NASA/Goddard Data Assimilation Office (DAO) Goddard Earth Observing System GCM, (GEOS- 2 GCM) which is a component of the GEOS- 2 Data Assimilation System (DAS), is configured with a sufficient number of vertical levels to provide very fine resolution in the tropospheric and stratospheric regimes. The present study is aimed at understanding the benefits for accurate simulation of the climate seen in the GEOS- 2 GCM due to its choice of vertical resolution. Raising the model lid to the lower mesosphere so as to explicitly resolve the stratospheric circulation, in particular the descent over the winter pole, is included in GEOS- 2 to address the common GCM deficiency of a stratospheric <b>cold</b> <b>pole</b> bias. Increasing the number of levels is directed at improving the representation of the planetary boundary layer, the troposphere at the altitude of the sub-tropical jet stream, and the stratosphere.

During periods of enhanced East African rainfall, Indian Ocean SST anomalies reminiscent of a tropical Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) event are observed. Ensemble simulations with an atmospheric general circulation model are used to understand the relative effect of local and large-scale Indian Ocean SST anomalies on above-average East African precipitation. The importance of the various tropical and subtropical IOD SST poles, both indi-vidually and in combination, is quantified. In the simulations, enhanced East African ‘‘short rains’ ’ are predominantly driven by the local warm SST anomalies in the western equatorial Indian Ocean, while the eastern <b>cold</b> <b>pole</b> of the tropical IOD is of lesser importance. The changed East African rainfall distribution can be explained by a reorganization of the atmospheric circulation induced by the SST anomalies. A reduction in sea level pressure over the western half of the IndianOcean and converging wind anomalies over East Africa lead to moisture convergence and increased convective activity over the region. The pattern of large-scale circulation changes over the tropical Indian Ocean and adjacent landmasses is consistent with an anomalous strengthening of the Walker cell. The seasonal cycle of various indices related to the SST and the atmospheric circulation in the equatorial Indian Ocean are examined to assess their potential usefulness for seasonal forecasting. 1...|$|E
40|$|A middle {{atmosphere}} temperature benchmark in the polar region {{is critical to}} monitoring the climate change. However, it is very challenging to establish such a benchmark because {{it is difficult to}} observe temperatures in the polar region and numerous factors affect the temperature variations. Ground-base lidars are capable of providing high-resolution and long-duration measurements of temperatures in the polar region, which is critical in advancing our understanding of the {{middle atmosphere}} thermal structures and dynamics. In this study, the lidar temperature morphology is formed at Rothera (67. 5 ºS, 68 ºW) and South Pole using the lidar observations from 1999 to 2005. Teleconnection (inter-hemispheric coupling) is one of the new mechanisms causing, e. g., the temperature variations in the southern polar middle and upper atmosphere by regions not physically attached, e. g., the northern polar stratosphere. We study it by deriving the teleconnection patterns over the global latitudes and from the stratosphere to lower thermosphere using 8 -year temperature observations of SABER and 54 -year temperature and wind simulations of WACCM. A main new finding is that the teleconnection extends well into the lower thermosphere, the thermospheric anomalies are consistent with the corresponding changes of the winter-to-summer lower-thermospheric branch of the residual circulation, and the winter stratosphere perturbations influence the stratosphere, mesosphere and thermosphere globally. <b>Cold</b> <b>pole</b> bias is a long-standing problem in most general circulation and chemistry climate models, referring to the simulated southern winter stratosphere is significantly colder than observations. Our lidar measurements are used to quantify such bias in WACCM.

Also, the polar vortex breaks earlier and the wind reversal level during spring is lower, making the WACCM simulations closer to observations. Overall this thesis work helps advance our understanding of the polar region thermal structure and how dynamics affect the temperature variations.

In this poster I present newly obtained results of pollen and testate amoebae analyses. My study is focused on three following topics: 1. Pleistocene and Early Holocene vegetation and climate history in the Verkhoyansk Mountains (Yakutia, Russia) derived from pollen recordsThe pollen spectra from the P 12 section located near the Tumara river (63 °N, 130 °E) shows that open tundra- and steppe-like Poaceae and Cyperaceae associations with some other herbs like Caryophyllaceae, Asteraceae, Ranunculaceae dominated the area for nearly the last 50 14 C kyr. Steppe-like communities with Artemisia, Cichoriaceae, Thalictrum existed. Shrubby tundra communities with Salix and Betula sect. Nanae reflect the existence of relatively wet habitats during this relatively warm period (Karginsky Interstadial). Attention has {{to be paid to}} the lower part of this section. Samples were dated up to 220 14 C kyr BP possibly representing the Eemian Interglacial with increasing numbers of tree pollen (PZ II-III). 2. Testate Amoebae as palaeoenvironmental indicators in quaternary sediments from Cape Mamontovy Klyk, Laptev Sea, RussiaInvestigated samples from the Cape Mamontovy Klyk (73 °N, 116 °E) at the Laptev Sea coast are covering the last 50 14 C kyr. The main characteristic of the Mamontovy Klyk fossil rhizopod complexes is the dominance of eurybiotic soil genera, including Centropyxis, Cyclopyxis, Plagiopyxis and Phryganella. These genera have a wide tolerance to changes of environmental conditions. They also reflect soil conditions rather similar to the modern arctic tundra environment, especially for the period 40 - 50 14 C kyr BP (Karginsky Interstadial). During the interval between 30 - 10 14 C kyr BP species diversity and density decreased and some testate amoebae completely disappeared, indicating the harsh environments of the Sartan stadial period. 3. Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions in the Central Verkhoyansk Mountains: pollen record from Lake Billyakh, RussiaThe study at Lake Billyakh (65 °N, 120 °E; 340 m a. s. l.) in April 2005 was stimulated through foregoing Russian-German expeditions in the Central Verkhoyansk Mountains in 2002 / 2003. This area is characterized by extreme continental climate conditions and coldest winter temperatures (Oimjakon <b>Cold</b> <b>Pole</b> of the Northern Hemisphere). Permafrost layer is continuous and northern larch (Larix dahurica) taiga dominates the vegetation. First radiocarbon dates indicates a Holocene age for the upper sediment section (2 m).

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that cold air temperatures (Ta) constrain the metabolic diversity of high-latitude endotherms {{is based on}} the observation among birds and mammals that mean field metabolic rate (FMR) increases, whereas the variability of FMR decreases, from the warm tropics to the <b>cold</b> <b>poles.</b> However, there is a paucity of FMR measurements from above 60 ° latitude and below 0 °C. We measured the daily energy expenditure of a high-latitude population of free-ranging snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus Erxleben, 1777) in Yukon, Canada, in winter (Ta-mean = – 16. 4 °C) and in autumn (Ta-mean = 0. 5 °C). Doubly labelled water measures of FMR were approximately 20 % lower in winter than in autumn, and were a similar, low multiple of resting metabolic rate in both seasons (2. 04 and 1. 94, respectively). The mass-corrected FMR of snowshoe hares in winter was only half the value predicted by extrapolating the relationship between FMR and Ta > 0 to – 16. 4 °C. These results contribute to an emerging pattern of a reversal in the relationship between FMR and Ta in free-ranging mammals from negative above 0 °C to positive below 0 °C. We refer to the positive, low Ta portion of this relationship as the cold shoulder, and suggest that it may reflect the general necessity for free-ranging mammals to use behavioural and (or) physiological means to conserve energy during long winters when cold conditions coincide with resource scarcity...|$|R

The difference in temperature means that ice preferentially sublimates from Cassini Regio, and deposits in the bright areas and especially at the even <b>colder</b> <b>poles.</b> Over geologic time scales, this would further darken Cassini Regio and brighten the rest of Iapetus, creating a positive feedback thermal runaway process of ever greater contrast in albedo, ending with all exposed ice being lost from Cassini Regio.

This model explains the distribution of light and dark areas, the absence of shades of grey, and the thinness of the dark material covering Cassini Regio.

40|$|Past {{studies of}} the climatic {{behavior}} of water on Mars have universally assumed that the atmosphere is the sole pathway available for volatile exchange between the planet's crustal and polar reservoirs of H 20. However, if the planetary inventory of outgassed H 20 exceeds the pore volume of the cryosphere {{by more than a}} few percent, then a subpermafrost groundwater system of global extent will necessarily result. The existence of such a system raises the possibility that subsurface transport may complement long-term atmospheric exchange. In this paper, the hydrologic response of a water-rich Mars to climate change and to the physical and thermal evolution of its crust is considered. The analysis assumes that the atmospheric leg of the planet's long-term hydrologic ycle is reasonably described by current models of insolation-driven exchange. Under the climatic conditions that have apparently prevailed throughout most of Martian geologic history, the thermal instability of ground ice at low- to mid-latitudes has led to a net atmospheric transport of H 20 from the "hot " equatorial region to the <b>colder</b> <b>poles.</b> Theoretical arguments and various lines of morphologic evidence suggest that this poleward flux of H 20 has been episodically augmented by additional releases of water resulting from impacts, catastrophic floods, and volcanism.

Triton rotates with a period of 5. 877 days in a right-hand sense about the south pole, where the season now is late spring 4. Here we argue that these features can be explained if Triton, like Mars, has a global, well-structured atmosphere in equilibrium with surface frosts. The subliming frost cap produces a polar anticyclone at low altitudes, with northeastward winds of ~ 5 m s^(− 1) within the Ekman boundary layer. The temperature contrast between the <b>cold</b> frost-covered <b>pole</b> and the warm unfrosted equator produces westward winds at high altitudes...|$|R
6000|$|If Emerson stood thus well {{towards the}} social and {{political}} drift of events, his teaching was no less harmoniously related to the new and most memorable drift of science which set in by his side. It is a misconception to pretend that he was a precursor of the Darwinian theory. Evolution, as a possible explanation of the ordering of the universe, is a great deal older than either Emerson or Darwin. What Darwin did was to work out in detail and with masses of minute evidence a definite hypothesis of the specific conditions under which new forms are evolved. Emerson, of course, had no definite hypothesis of this sort, nor did he possess any of the knowledge necessary to give it value. But it was his good fortune that some of his strongest propositions harmonise with the scientific theory of the survival of the fittest in the struggle for material existence. He connects his exhortation to self-reliance with the law working in nature for conservation and growth,--to wit, that 'Power is in nature the essential measure of right,' and that 'Nature suffers nothing to remain in her kingdom which cannot help itself.' The same strain is constantly audible. Nature on every side, within us and without, is for ever throwing out new forms and fresh varieties of living and thinking. To her experiments in every region there is no end. Those succeed which prove to have the best adaptation to the conditions. Let, therefore, neither society nor the individual check experiment, originality, and infinite variation. Such language, we may see, fits in equally well with democracy in politics and with evolution in science. If, moreover, modern science gives more prominence to one conception than another, it is to that of the natural universe of force and energy, as One and a Whole. This too is the great central idea with Emerson, repeated a thousand times in prose and in verse, and lying {{at the very heart of}} his philosophy. Newton's saying that 'the world was made at one cast' delights him. 'The secret of the world is that its energies are solidaires.' Nature 'publishes itself in creatures, reaching from particles and spicula, through transformation on transformation to the highest symmetries. A little heat, that is, a little motion, is all that differences the bald dazzling white and deadly <b>cold</b> <b>poles</b> of the earth from the prolific tropical climates.' Not only, as Professor Tyndall says, is Emerson's religious sense entirely undaunted by the discoveries of science; all such discoveries he comprehends and assimilates. 'By Emerson scientific conceptions are continually transmuted into the finer forms and warmer lines of an ideal world.' ...|$|R
40|$|Active {{volcanism}} {{observed on}} Io {{could provide a}} continuous source of gases from Io's interior. Only {{a small fraction of}} what is coming out of Io's volcanoes is escaping; the bulk of it is being recycled. There must be an atmospheric reservoir which maintains the gases until they {{have had a chance to}} recycle. Such an atmosphere must be protected from Jupiter's corotating plasma in order to be stable. Only the dayside atmosphere is subject to escape, while the <b>cold</b> nightside and <b>poles</b> would serve as a sink for atmospheric gases. However, the scavenging of atmospheric gases is maximum at the eastern elongation and minimum at the western elongation. A stable SO 2 atmosphere on Io shows promise if the volcanic activity is continuous. If the volcanoes stop erupting, the atmosphere will be depleted...|$|R

Was Socialist Realism, the official art of the Soviet Union, simply the dictated ideological product of a totalitarian cultural policy, or were its producers progressive artists, harnessed to a great national tradition and liberated from the constraints of a market-driven art establishment? These are the two <b>Cold</b> War <b>poles</b> of contention that simplify the reality of a diverse and complex art establishment. Through an analysis of Aleksandr Laktionov, a popular and contentious Soviet artist who rose to prominence in the late 1940 s, it is possible to trace the main arguments and controversies that helped to shape the Soviet art world in the post-war years. This project employs archival material such as visitors' books from major exhibitions, stenographic reports of meetings, documents pertaining to the organisation of exhibitions and letters and personal documents in order to reconstruct and examine significant moments in the career of a major Soviet artist, including detailed analyses of several individual works of art. This unique case study of Laktionov's work and its popular and critical reception reveals an art establishment that was structured in the late 1940 s according to privileged lines of patronage and association, and in the 1950 s became the battleground of a struggle for taste. The Soviet public defied attempts to mould and direct their tastes by responding to works of art as diverse and impassioned consumers, and the Soviet artist played an active role in contributing to an evolving definition of Socialist Realism.
