40|$|Abstract. A {{crucial part}} of safety-critical systems {{development}} is identifying how system behaviours lead to accidents. Doing this for complex systems is hard {{because of the need}} to consider the interaction between multiple simultaneous failures and normal system behaviours. Multi-agent simulation provides a way to explore the behaviour that emerges from a model of a system under normal and failure conditions. However, it is easy to generate vast amounts of data from such simulations that can be hard to comprehend and <b>interpret.</b> <b>Machine</b> learning can be applied to help understand the patterns that are implicit in this data. This paper first describes the concept of hazard analysis, and how this can be performed using multi-agent simulation. It then describes how machine learning techniques can be used to extract rules from simulation output. The approach is illustrated using a military system-of-systems case study. ...|$|R

25|$|The 256-element free Boolean algebra {{on three}} {{generators}} is deployed in computer displays based on raster graphics, which use bit blit to manipulate whole regions consisting of pixels, relying on Boolean operations to specify how the source region should {{be combined with}} the destination, typically {{with the help of}} a third region called the mask. Modern video cards offer all 223=256 ternary operations for this purpose, with the choice of operation being a one-byte (8-bit) parameter. The constants SRC = 0xaa or 10101010, DST = 0xcc or 11001100, and MSK = 0xf0 or 11110000 allow Boolean operations such as (SRC^DST) (meaning XOR the source and destination and then AND the result with the mask) to be written directly as a constant denoting a byte calculated at compile time, 0x60 in the (SRC^DST) example, 0x66 if just SRC^DST, etc. At run time the video <b>card</b> <b>interprets</b> the byte as the raster operation indicated by the original expression in a uniform way that requires remarkably little hardware and which takes time completely independent of the complexity of the expression.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Electrostatic {{separators}} {{are used}} in several modern storage rings to generate large distortions of the closed orbit {{as a means of}} avoiding undesirable beam-beam collisions in the arcs. Unlike comparable magnetic elements, there is not a well developed technology to measure the electric field quality of electrostatic separators, so the ultimate field uniformity is largely left up to the conservatism and skill of the designers and fabricators of the devices. Measurements of the electric field integrate over the entire path of the particles, including end effects, and sense the effects of misalignments, warpage and other mechanical errors on individual units. This ability not only helps with quality control, but also to <b>interpret</b> <b>machine</b> studies where the results are sensitive to the nonuniformities of the electric field. In particular, electric field measurements can provide a better estimate of the tuneshift and sextupole moments as a function of beam position in...|$|R
40|$|I {{remember}} {{attending a}} seminar at Edinburgh where {{the intricacies of}} their PL/I abstract machine were explained. The states of these machines are tuples of various kinds of complex trees {{and there is also}} a stack of environments; the transition rules involve much tree traversal to access syntactical control points, handle jumps, and to manage concurrency. I recall not much liking this way of doing operational semantics. It seemed far too complex, burying essential semantical ideas in masses of detail; further, the machine states were too big. The lesson I took from this was that abstract <b>interpreting</b> <b>machines</b> do not scale up well when used as a human-oriented method of specification for real languages (but see below for further comment).

40|$|SIMD {{computers}} {{have proved to}} be a useful and cost effective approach to massively parallel computation. On the other hand, there are algorithms which are very inefficient when directly translated into a data-parallel program. This paper presents a number of simple transformations which are able to reduce this SIMD overhead to a moderate constant factor. In particular, this factor is often much smaller than the factor incurred by the previously used technique of <b>interpreting</b> <b>machine</b> instruction sets. The paper also introduces techniques for reducing the remaining overhead using Markov chain models of control flow. The optimization problems involved turn out to be NP-hard in general but there are many useful heuristics, and closed form optimizations for a probabilistic variant. 1 Introduction Single Instruction Multiple Data computers are a quite effective approach to massively parallel computation.

50|$|Medical {{studies suggest}} a {{relation}} between ICU volume {{and quality of}} care for mechanically ventilated patients. After adjustment for severity of illness, demographic variables, and characteristics of the ICUs (including staffing by intensivists), higher ICU volume {{was significantly associated with}} lower ICU and hospital mortality rates. For example, adjusted ICU mortality (for a patient at average predicted risk for ICU death) was 21.2% in hospitals with 87 to 150 mechanically ventilated patients annually, and 14.5% in hospitals with 401 to 617 mechanically ventilated patients annually. Hospitals with intermediate numbers of patients had outcomes between these extremes.

It is shown that the gradient of the hypervolume is defined by a self-adjusting weighted mean of the individual loss gradients, making it similar to the gradient of a weighted mean loss but without requiring the weights to be defined a priori. This enables an inner boosting-like behavior, where the current model is used to automatically place higher weights on samples with higher losses but without requiring the use of multiple models. Results on a denoising autoencoder show that the new formulation is able to achieve better mean loss than the direct optimization of the mean loss, providing evidence to the conjecture that self-adjusting the weights creates a smoother loss surface...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{proof of concept}} that machine {{learning}} techniques {{can be used to}} predict the properties of CNOHF energetic molecules from their molecular structures. We focus on a small but diverse dataset consisting of 109 molecular structures spread across ten compound classes. Up until now, candidate molecules for energetic materials have been screened using predictions from expensive quantum simulations and thermochemical codes. We present a comprehensive comparison of machine learning models and several molecular featurization methods - sum over bonds, custom descriptors, Coulomb matrices, Bag of Bonds, and fingerprints. The best featurization was sum over bonds (bond counting), and the best model was kernel ridge regression. Despite having a small data set, we obtain acceptable errors and Pearson correlations for the prediction of detonation pressure, detonation velocity, explosive energy, heat of formation, density, and other properties out of sample. By including another dataset with 309 additional molecules in our training we show how the error can be pushed lower, although the convergence with number of molecules is slow.

40|$|There is a {{requirement}} for improved three-dimensional surface characterisation and reduced tool wear when modern computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools are operating at high cutting velocities, spindle speeds and feed rates. For large depths of cut and large material removal rates, {{there is a tendency}} for machines to chatter caused by selfexcited vibration in the machine tools leading to precision errors, poor surface finish quality, tool wear and possible machine damage. This study illustrates a method for improving machine tool performance by understanding and adaptively controlling the machine structural vibration. The first step taken is to measure and <b>interpret</b> <b>machine</b> tool vibration and produce a structural model. As a consequence, appropriate sensors need to be selected and/or designed and then integrated to measure all self-excited vibrations. The vibrations of the machine under investigation need to be clearly understood by analysis of sensor signals and surface finish measurement. The active vibration control system has been implemented on a CNC machine tool and validated under controlled conditions by compensating for machine tool vibrations on time-varying multi-point cutting operations for a vertical milling machine.
