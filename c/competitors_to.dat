5|$|Although {{the title}} is a World Tag Team Championship, three wrestlers have held the {{championship}} by themselves — Samoa Joe, Kurt Angle, and Matt Morgan. Joe held the championship during his entire reign alone; however, Angle held the championship alone for 15 days until Sting won a match involving three other <b>competitors</b> <b>to</b> become Angle's partner, and Morgan held the title after turning on and (kayfabe) injuring his tag team championship partner Hernandez.

5|$|Captain Dibble was the Scottish Grand National {{winner in}} 1992 and vied for {{favouritism}} for the Grand National {{until a few}} days before the race. Scudamore had turned down a host of <b>competitors</b> <b>to</b> take the ride in his 13th National, and the pair were sent off at 9/1. Scudamore saw trainer Martin Pipe waving at him near the water jump to stop. The jockey had never won the National in his previous 12 attempts, and retired from racing a short time later.|$|E
5|$|In the 1903 Tour de France, the {{organisation}} guaranteed {{that the first}} 50 cyclists in the final general classification would earn at least 5 francs per day. In 1904, if not more than 50 cyclists would finish, also cyclists who dropped out during the race would still get 5 francs for the days {{they had been in}} the race. This rule was added to attract cyclists who otherwise would not enter, because the Tour needed enough <b>competitors</b> <b>to</b> remain credible.|$|E
5|$|Rwandans {{have been}} {{competing}} at the Olympic Games since 1984, and the Paralympic Games since 2004. The country sent seven <b>competitors</b> <b>to</b> the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, representing it in athletics, swimming, mountain biking and judo, and 15 <b>competitors</b> <b>to</b> the London Summer Paralympics {{to compete in}} athletics, powerlifting and sitting volleyball.

5|$|Francine Niyonizigiye, Burundi's flag bearer at {{the opening}} ceremony, competed on Burundi's behalf at the Beijing Olympics, in the women's 5000metre races.

During the qualification round, which took place on August 19, Niyonizigiye competed in the sixteen-person second heat. She finished the race in 17minutes, 8.44seconds, finishing in fourteenth place, the last of the finishing athletes, after Russia's Yelena Zadorozhnaya was disqualified. Niyonizigiye finished just under aminute behind thirteenth placing Hungarian Krisztina Papp. The heat itself was led by Ethiopia's Meseret Defar (14minutes 56.32seconds).

5|$|The Olympics {{were then}} halted {{due to the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II. Australia did not send a team to the 1948 Winter Olympics, but has competed at every Winter Olympics since, sending nine athletes to the 1952 Olympics. There were five skiers, two cross-country and three downhill—who either failed to finish or whose results were unknown—three figure skaters and one speed skater. Adrian Swan and Nancy Burley, who finished 10th and 14th in figure skating, {{were the only two}} Australia <b>competitors</b> <b>to</b> place in the top 20, although neither placed in {{the top half of the}} field. Burley and fellow figure skater Gweneth Molony were the first two women to represent Australia at the Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Western {{recreational}} activities {{were introduced to}} Madagascar {{over the past two}} centuries. Rugby union is considered the national sport of Madagascar. Soccer is also popular. Madagascar has produced a world champion in pétanque, a French game similar to lawn bowling, which is widely played in urban areas and throughout the Highlands. School athletics programs typically include soccer, track and field, judo, boxing, women's basketball and women's tennis. Madagascar sent its first <b>competitors</b> <b>to</b> the Olympic Games in 1964 and has also competed in the African Games. Scouting is represented in Madagascar by its own local federation of three scouting clubs. Membership in 2011 was estimated at 14,905.|$|E
5|$|Although {{trained as}} a lawyer, Carmelo began fencing at an early age, {{beginning}} in the 1910s, {{at the behest of}} his father and, much like his father, specialized in épée, while also being proficient at fleuret. In 1918 he came in first place in the former category and second in the latter at a competition, organized by the city of Buenos Aires. In the next two years, he finished at the top in both events and became nationally known. In 1921 the Argentine Fencing Federation was founded and, in 1922, the organization sent him to represent Argentina in the Olimpiados Latinamericanos, a celebration overseen by the International Olympic Committee to celebrate the centenary of Brazil's declaration of independence. His native country won first place in the épée, fleuret and sabre events in the host city of Rio de Janeiro. At the age of 17, {{he was one of the}} youngest <b>competitors</b> <b>to</b> represent his country at these games.|$|E

5|$|Assisting {{communication}} {{across many}} modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The ATM protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a traffic contract with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet {{the conditions of the}} traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are <b>competitors</b> <b>to</b> ATM, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.|$|E
5|$|In {{the cross}} country events, {{the heat of}} 45°C (113°F), caused all but 15 of the 38 <b>competitors</b> <b>to</b> abandon the race. Eight {{finishers}} were taken away on stretchers. One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious. Early leader Wide {{was among those who}} blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital. Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a minute and a half. As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward. An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track, thinking he had reached the finish line. After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, he turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold. Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.|$|E
5|$|Jack Howard {{represented}} the Federated States of Micronesia as its only male track athlete at the Beijing Olympics. He {{competed in the}} men's 100meters races. Born in the island of Weno in the Chuuk Lagoon along with his twin brother John Howard, Jack Howard was born in July 1981 and was 27 {{years old when he}} competed in Beijing. Howard had not previously competed at any Olympic games. Howard competed in heat seven against seven other athletes in the qualification round of the event on August 14. He finished the race in 11.03seconds, ranking seventh in his heat; he placed ahead of Gordon Heather of the Cook Islands (11.41seconds) and immediately behind Monaco's Sebastien Gattuso (10.70seconds) in a heat led by Qatar's Samuel Francis (10.40seconds) and Trinidad and Tobago's Marc Burns (10.46seconds). Overall, 80 competitors took part in the qualification round of the event. Howard ranked 66th. Of the 80 <b>competitors</b> <b>to</b> compete the top 41 qualified for the second round and, therefore, Howard did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
