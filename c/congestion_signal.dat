40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new architecture that en-ables {{a set of}} clients to enforce traffic shaping policies among them through the delegation of <b>congestion</b> <b>signals.</b> When congestion-aware Internet flows share a bottleneck link, they compete for bandwidth and must respond to <b>congestion</b> <b>signals</b> promptly by decreasing their throughput. For clients running real-time applications (e. g., gaming, streaming), this may im-pose strict limitation on their achievable throughput over short time-scales. To that end, this paper {{presents a}}n architecture, whereby a set of TCP connections (we {{refer to them as}} the Stunts) sacrifice/trade their performance on behalf of another TCP connection (we refer to it as the Free) by picking up a delegated subset of the <b>congestion</b> <b>signals</b> and reacting to them in lieu of the Free connection. This gives the Free connection just enough freedom to meet specific throughput requirements as requested by the application running on top, without affecting the level of congestion in the network.

40|$|The self-congestion probing, which {{estimates}} bandwidth {{by controlling}} a temporal congestion of a probing stream, {{is the most}} popular approach in bandwidth measurement. Self-congestion tools are easy to implement, fast to converge and are robust to network dynamics with reasonably good accuracy; however, the current tools only exploit parts of the <b>congestion</b> <b>signals,</b> though the probing stream experiences a rich spectrum of <b>congestion</b> <b>signals.</b> TCP protocols follow the same self-congestion principle on inferring available bandwidth. We propose a unified self-congestion probing framework by bridging the self-congestion probing for available bandwidth measurement and TCP congestion control. The recent progress of TCP congestion control in both theory and experimentation provides new avenues in improving the current self-congestion tools. Based on this unified framework, we design and evaluate a simple available bandwidth probing scheme to utilize the Explicit <b>Congestion</b> Notification <b>signal,</b> namely, ECNProbe. We conduct a measurement study on a Linux-based testbed and evaluate the performance of several available bandwidth measurement tools.

40|$|While {{computer}} networks go towards dealing with varied traffic types with different service requirements, {{there is a}} necessity for modern network control mechanisms that can control the network traffic to meet the users ' service requirements. Optimizing the network utilization by improving the network performance can help to accommodate more users and thus increase operators’ profits. Controlling the congestion at the gateway leads to better performance of the network. Sending <b>congestion</b> <b>signal</b> sooner can be of great benefit to the TCP connection.

40|$|Although delay-based {{congestion}} control protocols such as FAST promise to deliver better performance than traditional TCP Reno, {{they have not}} yet been widely incorporated to the Internet. Several factors have contributed to their lack of deployment. Probably, the main contributing factor is that they are not able to compete fairly against loss-based {{congestion control}} protocols. In fact, the transmission rate in equilibrium of delay-based approaches is always less than their fair share when they share the network with traditional TCP-Reno derivatives, that employ packet losses as their <b>congestion</b> <b>signal.</b> There are also other performance impairments caused by the sensitivity to errors in the measurement of the <b>congestion</b> <b>signal</b> (queuing delay) that reduce the efficiency and the intra-protocol fairness of the algorithms.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a TCP connection is typically dic-tated by what the network can provide rather than what the application would like to achieve.

40|$|Vancouver, Canada, the {{following}} overall considerations should {{be discussed in}} the workshop and included in work toward solution(s). 1. Requirements and Use Case Scope a. The congestion control algorithm should be widely applicable for:- all IRTC applications (RTCWEB, CLUE, AVT, etc.),- across a wide range of media bit rates (few kbps to many Mbps),- all network types (Wi-Fi, 4 G, DSL, HFC, fiber, enterprise, data center), and their corresponding delay, loss and throughput characteristics. b. The congestion control algorithm should balance the twin goals of maximizing throughput and minimizing delay/loss. It should discover when it is powerless to achieve some goals (for example, due to many other flows dominating the delay, loss or throughput characteristics), and adapt its balance toward the achievable goals accordingly. It should also balance stability and responsiveness. c. The congestion control algorithm should detect and react to all implicit <b>congestion</b> <b>signals</b> (e. g. delay/loss) as well as explicit <b>congestion</b> <b>signals</b> from the network (e. g. ECN/PCN) if deployed. Ignoring or misinterpreting any signals degrades effectiveness. Implicit signals should be filtered to distinguish between congestion and noise. Explicit signals should not be required for effective operation, but should be required to be utilized by the algorithm when present [Zhu 12]...|$|R

40|$|Congestion {{on power}} grids seems a {{physical}} reality, a "hard" fact easy to check. Our paper models a different idea: <b>congestion</b> <b>signal</b> may be distorted by transmission system operators (TSOs), which puts the European integrated electricity market at risk. 1 ʻ when the TSOs share the revenue produced by congestion's pricing {{they have an}} incentive in distorting data. 2 ʻ because congestion signals are not physical data but "home made" conventions, TSOs could be able distorting them. 3 ʻ when congestion appears on cross border lines that link several countries with their own regulatory mechanisms, the settlement of this incentive's problem necessitates {{a high degree of}} coordination. Congestion puts undoubtedly the threat of a collapse on interconnected grids. The "capacity constrained situations" have therefore to be avoided. Congestion signalling depends on norms set by TSOs and a signal is given when the power flows attain the "secure" limits set by TSOs. These security norms are not stable and invariable because some flexibility is needed by {{the very nature of the}} power flows and because lines physical capacity limits are not constant. Therefore TSOs are defining the <b>congestion</b> <b>signal</b> on a variable, complex and non transparent constraint and may manipulate it for their own interests. In Nordic countries the "Light Handed Regulation" makes this opportunistic behaviour more likely. We need a more effective congestion regulatory mechanism.

40|$|European Union is {{creating}} an Electricity Single Market since {{the vote of}} a directive by the Energy Council and the European Parliament in 1996. In facts technical keys for opening or locking national electricity markets are still {{owned and operated by}} the national transmission grid monopolies named “Transmission System Operators ” (TSOs). By declaring or not “congestion ” on their borders, they are the TSOs who delimitate the actual size of the European integrated electricity market. The unbundling of these TSOs from the business of generating and selling electricity was thought to protect the European Union from national market opening manipulations.
