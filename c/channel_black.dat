60|$|Surgeon-Major Thomson awoke {{about twelve}} hours {{later with a}} start. He had been {{sleeping}} so heavily {{that he was at}} first unable to remember his whereabouts. His mind moved sluggishly across the brief panorama of his hurried journey--the special train from Victoria to Folkestone; the destroyer which had brought him and a few other soldiers across the <b>Channel,</b> <b>black</b> with darkness, at a pace which made even the promenade deck impossible; the landing at Boulogne, a hive of industry notwithstanding the darkness; the clanking of waggons, the shrieking of locomotives, the jostling of crowds, the occasional flashing of an electric torch. And then the ride in the great automobile through the misty night. He rubbed his eyes and looked around him. A grey morning was breaking. The car had come to a standstill before a white gate, in front of which was stationed a British soldier, with drawn bayonet. Surgeon-Major Thomson pulled himself together and answered the challenge.|$|E

50|$|Carbon black (subtypes are {{acetylene}} black, <b>channel</b> <b>black,</b> furnace black, {{lamp black}} and thermal black) is a material {{produced by the}} incomplete combustion of heavy petroleum products such as FCC tar, coal tar, ethylene cracking tar, and a small amount from vegetable oil. Carbon black {{is a form of}} paracrystalline carbon that has a high surface-area-to-volume ratio, albeit lower than that of activated carbon. It is dissimilar to soot in its much higher surface-area-to-volume ratio and significantly lower (negligible and non-bioavailable) PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) content. However, carbon black is widely used as a model compound for diesel soot for diesel oxidation experiments. Carbon black is mainly used as a reinforcing filler in tires and other rubber products. In plastics, paints, and inks carbon black is used as a color pigment.|$|E

40|$|An {{interesting}} alternativ way for forming complex shaped ceramics is {{the so-called}} hot moulding (low pressure injection moulding). The topic of the paper was the stabilization of channel carbon black in several solvents. A good dispersion in polar and apolar solvents was obtainable by surface modification of <b>channel</b> <b>black</b> with appropriate surfactants. This surface modification could be confirmed by means of iodine adsorption. Considering the possible stabilization of SiC and boron in such solvents, several ways of manufacturing hot slip formulations for the sintered silicon carbide were proposed. A method containing wet homogenization of SiC and boron in water, stabilization of <b>channel</b> <b>black</b> in aqueous solution of a cationic surfactant and subsequent heterocoagulation was used. With optimal batches and processing conditions, sinter densities of 96 to 97 per cent of the theoretical value were achieved...|$|E

40|$|Studies of {{the small}} x {{dynamics}} at HERA energies allow to quantify the range of momentum transfers and energies for which {{the strength of the}} interaction ap-proaches the maximum strength allowed by unitarity in the gluon <b>channel</b> (<b>black</b> disk limit- BDL). Implications for the proton-proton interactions at collider en-ergies (Tevatron, LHC) include a dominance of BDL up to transverse momenta of hadrons (jets) in the final state ∼ few GeV for collision at small impact param-eters, and explanation of the proximity of the impact factor of pp interaction to one at small impact parameters, leading to universality of cross sections at super-high energies. We discuss briefly the theoretical challenges in the applications of pQCD to small x phenomena, the similarity between small x physics and critical phenomena, and new QCD phenomena related to this puzzle. 1. Transverse distribution of partons in a nucleon To ensure effective searches for new particle production at LHC one needs to account properly for the presence of the hard QCD interactions which rapidly increases with energy. The practical way to meet this challenge is to develop a realistic model for the QCD interactions at the LHC en-ergies which would incorporate information about the nucleon structure and small x dynamics revealed in the analyses of the QCD phenomena at HERA. One key element is the information about transverse structure of...|$|E
40|$|Book synopsis: A {{lively and}} {{informed}} {{reflection on the}} experience of black people in Britain. The varied experience of the Caribbean diaspora in Britain, with its difficult and fractured history, is reflected in this distinctive and lively collection. The contributors to Inside Babylon show how employers and police, psychiatrists and welfare services, help to <b>channel</b> <b>black</b> people into residential and occupational ghettoes. Clive Harris, Bob Carter and Shirley Joshi analyse the economic destiny of Afro-Caribbeans in Britain. Going beyond the familiar prisms of race relations and reductionist class analysis they illuminate the radicalizing dynamic of British capitalism in the postwar period. Errol Francis provides a shocking account of the experience of black people at the hands of psychiatrists in Britain. Cecil Gutzmore finds the Notting Hill carnival to be a litmus test of racist formations in both the media and the state, as well as evidence of the resilience of the black community. Amina Mama and Claudette Williams explore the position of women in black communities while Gail Lewis focuses on their characteristic patterns of employment. In a powerful concluding essay Winston James charts the unfolding of a new Afro-Caribbean identity in Britain and debunks the notion that racist structures by themselves create a homogeneous black community. Inside Babylon is a radical and timely indictment which moves beyond over-simplified and misleading stereotypes to identify and explore the impressive struggles of black people of Britain...|$|E
