5|$|In {{addition}} to the other conquests, the Empire established a presence in Visigothic Hispania, when the usurper Athanagild requested assistance in his rebellion against King Agila I. In 552, Justinian dispatched a force of 2,000 men; according to the historian Jordanes, this army was led by the octogenarian Liberius. The Byzantines took Cartagena and other cities on the southeastern coast and founded the new province of Spania before being <b>checked</b> <b>by</b> their former ally Athanagild, who had by now become king. This campaign marked the apogee of Byzantine expansion.|$|E

Padded harnesses are required, each musher must carry an appropriate amount of food, and additional food supplies must be in position at checkpoints.|$|E
5|$|On 7 October 1964, Vulcan B.2 XM601 crashed during {{overshoot}} from an asymmetric power practice approach at Coningsby. The copilot had executed the asymmetric {{power approach}} with two engines producing thrust and two at idle. He was being <b>checked</b> <b>by</b> the Squadron Commander, who was {{unfamiliar with the}} aircraft. When he commenced the overshoot the copilot moved all the throttles to full power. The engines that had been producing power reached full power more quickly than the engines at idle and the resultant asymmetric thrust exceeded the available rudder authority, causing the aircraft to spin and crash. All the crew perished.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{began at}} about 8 a.m. {{with the first}} allied lines attacking the village of Telnitz, which was defended by the 3rd Line Regiment. This sector of the {{battlefield}} witnessed heavy fighting in this early action as several ferocious Allied charges evicted the French from the town and forced them onto {{the other side of}} the Goldbach. The first men of Davout's corps arrived at this time and threw the Allies out of Telnitz before they too were attacked by hussars and re-abandoned the town. Additional Allied attacks out of Telnitz were <b>checked</b> <b>by</b> French artillery.|$|E

5|$|Coalhouse Fort was manned {{during the}} First World War by No. 2 Company, Royal Garrison Artillery, which manned the guns, while the 2nd Company London Electrical Engineers {{operated}} the electric searchlights. A minefield {{was installed in}} the river between Shornemead and Coalhouse forts, with mechanically operated mines in the shallower parts {{of the river and}} remotely detonated mines in the navigable channel. Friendly ships could thus pass freely but the mines could be detonated by a shore-based observer if an enemy ship tried to use the main channel. Coalhouse Fort took on the role of an Examination Battery controlling the river traffic in conjunction with the River Examination Service. Incoming vessels were <b>checked</b> <b>by</b> tugs based alongside the old HMS Champion, moored in midriver, and if any vessel was deemed suspect or refused to stop, the fort was authorised to fire across its bows.|$|E
5|$|Coastal Command sank 27 U-boats in 1942 {{and damaged}} 18 more. Some of these kills were {{shared with the}} Navy. Bomber Command, by contrast, whose {{priority}} garnered them greater resources {{at the expense of}} Coastal Command, failed to destroy a single completed U-boat on the slip until April 1944. Arthur Harris, GOC Bomber Command, deplored the use of aircraft for defensive purposes and insisted the threat would be <b>checked</b> <b>by</b> attacking production. An indication of the effectiveness of air tactics was the fact very few Allied ships were sunk within 600 miles of British waters by late 1942. Between June 1942 to June 1943, 71 enemy submarines were sunk by the command.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to Nazi concentration camps, the Soviet gulags (labour camps) {{led to the}} death of citizens of occupied countries such as Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, as well as German prisoners of war (POWs) and even Soviet citizens who had been or were thought to be supporters of the Nazis. Sixty per cent of Soviet POWs of the Germans died during the war. Richard Overy gives the number of 5.7 million Soviet POWs. Of those, 57 per cent died or were killed, a total of 3.6million. Soviet ex-POWs and repatriated civilians were treated with great suspicion as potential Nazi collaborators, and some of them were sent to the Gulag upon being <b>checked</b> <b>by</b> the NKVD.|$|E

Latour tried to force {{his way around the}} French left with cavalry but was <b>checked</b> <b>by</b> the mounted troops of the Reserve. Finding his horsemen outnumbered near Ötigheim, Latour used his artillery to keep the French cavalry at bay. In the Rhine plain the combat raged until 10 PM. In the evening the Austrians were pushing Desaix back when bad news from the left flank caused Charles to call a halt.|$|E
5|$|Pilcher {{spent his}} early {{career as an}} {{infantry}} officer, first seeing active service on colonial campaigns in Nigeria in the late 1890s followed by field command in the Second Boer War (1899–1902), on which he published a book of lessons learned in 1903. Following the war, he held a number of senior commands in India. However, further promotion was <b>checked</b> <b>by</b> his having come into conflict with his commander-in-chief, who regarded him as unsuited for senior command {{in part because of}} his writings; Pilcher was a keen student of the German army and its operational methods, and an active theorist who published a number of controversial books advocating the adoption of new military techniques as well as an anonymous invasion novel.|$|E

5|$|Pyrrhus' {{advance on}} Argos {{did not go}} {{smoothly}} as his army was constantly harassed by vengeful Spartan troops led by Areus. By setting up ambushes and occupying strategic positions along the Epiriote line of retreat, the Spartans were able to inflict heavy casualties on Pyrrhus' rearguard of Gauls and Molossians. In an attempt to restore the wavering morale of his rear, Pyrrhus sent Ptolemy to assume its command. Pyrrhus hoped {{that the presence of}} his son amongst the troops would stiffen their resolve and enable to him to extricate the remainder of his troops from the narrow pass through which they were passing. Ptolemy's position was attacked by a picked Spartan war band under the command of Evaclus. In the ensuing struggle, Ptolemy was slain by the Spartans causing his remaining troops to rout. The victorious Spartans pursued the fleeing Epiriote rearguard until they were <b>checked</b> <b>by</b> some Epiriote infantry.|$|E
5|$|Samuelsson did {{not make}} his Panthers debut until December 8, 2011, missing the team's first 20 games {{following}} the trade due to a groin complications that had not fully healed in the off-season. In his first month with the team, he suffered another lower-body injury after being <b>checked</b> <b>by</b> Phoenix Coyotes forward Shane Doan during a game on December 20; he missed five games. Upon returning, he scored his first goal as a Panther since the 2003–04 season on January 6, 2012, in a 5–2 loss to the New Jersey Devils. Samuelsson finished the campaign with 14 goals and 31 points over 54 games, split between Vancouver and Florida. His points-per-game ranked fifth on the Panthers.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{men have}} {{resigned}} {{the office of}} governor {{before the end of}} their terms—John J. Crittenden, Beriah Magoffin, John W. Stevenson, Augustus O. Stanley, Happy Chandler, Earle C.

Only Beriah Magoffin resigned under duress. A Confederate sympathizer during the Civil War, Magoffin's power was entirely <b>checked</b> <b>by</b> a hostile, pro-Union legislature. With the state's government in gridlock, Magoffin agreed to resign in exchange for being able to name his successor. Lieutenant Governor Linn Boyd had died in office, and the Speaker of the Senate, John F. Fisk, was not acceptable to Magoffin as a successor. Fisk resigned as Speaker, and the Senate elected Magoffin's choice, James Fisher Robinson as Speaker. Magoffin then resigned, Robinson was elevated to governor, and Fisk was re-elected as Speaker of the Senate.|$|E
