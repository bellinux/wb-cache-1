5|$|Sydney was in Alexandria harbour on 10 June 1940, {{and that}} evening learned of Italy's {{intention}} {{to declare war}} at midnight. By 01:00 on 11 June, all ships in harbour had departed to search for Italian warships in position to attack Alexandria, and secure the sea lines of <b>communication</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern Mediterranean and Aegean.

Within that nominal group there is the Qualifier ‘on oral <b>communication</b> skills <b>in</b> <b>the</b> accountancy workplace’, which in turn, is constituted by another prepositional phrase with the preposition ‘on’ followed by the nominal group ‘oral <b>communication</b> skills <b>in</b> <b>the</b> accountancy workplace’.

The full circumstance ‘in the literature on oral <b>communication</b> skills <b>in</b> <b>the</b> accountancy workplace’ obviously construes circumstantial meaning, providing the location of <b>the</b> “gap” <b>in</b> <b>the</b> research, but within that circumstance, both Qualifiers, ‘on oral communication skills’ and ‘in the accountancy workplace’, provide further circumstantial meaning by way of Matter (what the literature is about: oral communication skills) and Location: place (where the oral communication skills are located: <b>in</b> <b>the</b> accountancy workplace) respectively.|$|R
5|$|After {{the rest}} day, the riders {{were faced with}} the Giro's longest stage, with {{numerous}} high mountain climbs along the course and {{the distinction of being}} the race's queen stage. It was originally scheduled to include the Col d'Izoard, which has been featured numerous times in the Tour de France as an Hors Categorie climb. Race officials later decided to alter the course, staying on the Italian side of the Alps, believing the stretches that were to take place in France were too remote and that radio <b>communication</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area could not be assured. The course as it originally was designed mimicked exactly a course used in the 1949 Giro d'Italia.|$|E
5|$|As president, Quwatli {{continued}} {{to press for}} Syrian independence from France. In a bid to garner American and British support for his government, he declared war against the Axis Powers, aligning Syria with the Allies. Growing countrywide unrest in response to French Mandatory rule led to French military assaults against Damascus and other Syrian cities in May 1945. More French troops were scheduled to land in Syria to aid the authorities, but at Quwatli's request for intervention, British troops invaded Syria from Transjordan, entering Damascus on 1 June. The French military campaign came to an immediate halt as a consequence; the UK and the US had viewed the French military action in Syria as a potential catalyst for further unrest throughout the Middle East and a detriment to British and American lines of <b>communication</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region.|$|E
5|$|Operation Coburg (24 January − 1 March 1968) was an Australian and New Zealand {{military}} action during the Vietnam War. The operation saw heavy fighting between the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) and North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong during the wider fighting around Long Binh and Bien Hoa. American and South Vietnamese intelligence reports had indicated that an imminent communist offensive during the Tet New Year festival was likely, {{and in response}} the Australians and New Zealanders were deployed away from their base in Phuoc Tuy Province to bolster American and South Vietnamese forces defending the Long Binh–Bien Hoa complex north-east of Saigon. 1 ATF deliberately established fire support bases astride the communist lines of <b>communication</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of the village of Trang Bom, expecting that they would attempt to destroy them. The Australians subsequently clashed with the Viet Cong during early patrols in Area of Operations (AO) Columbus, while later Fire Support Base (FSB) Andersen was repeatedly subjected to major ground assaults.|$|E

5|$|Situated along vital air and sea {{lanes of}} <b>communication</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of the}} Mediterranean, Crete was of {{considerable}} strategic importance to both sides and, after {{the conclusion of the}} campaign in Greece, the Allies fully expected that the Germans would attempt an invasion. The 4th Brigade was stationed as a reserve force in the area around Galatas with the 18th Battalion near the newly established general hospital. When the airborne invasion began on 20 May, the battalion quickly dealt with a company of Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) that landed near them. It carried out mopping up operations and patrolled the area for the next two days before assisting the 19th Battalion in an attack on Fallschirmjäger that had established a strong defensive position nearby.|$|E
5|$|The tenth {{stage was}} planned to mimic stage 17 of the 1949 Giro d'Italia, which was won by Italian cycling legend Fausto Coppi {{en route to}} the overall victory. That route {{originally}} included the Col d'Izoard, a climb in France which has been featured in the Tour de France numerous times. Race organizers were forced to alter this stage to cover only the Italian side of the Alps rather than also visit France, as there were concerns over radio <b>communication</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, and the roads stood the risk of landslides. It was subsequently made longer than first planned, with an additional, shorter climb added. Stages 10 and 16, the latter of which went over Monte Petrano and two other first-category climbs, were both called the race's queen stage.|$|E
