After characterising p-phenylacetate film-modified <b>carbon</b> <b>electrodes</b> in several redox systems in vitro, they were found to exhibit an 11 % loss in dopamine oxidation signal over a 40 -day storage period in ambient laboratory conditions, compared to over a 90 % loss at bare <b>carbon</b> <b>electrodes.</b> In addition, by incubating in a synthetic laboratory solution containing the fouling reagents, 1. 0 % (v/v) caproic acid (a lipid), 0. 1 % (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0. 01 % (w/v) cytochrome C (both are protein) and 0. 002 % (w/v) human fibrinopeptide B (a peptide), film-modified <b>carbon</b> <b>electrodes</b> showed a 29 % reduction {{in the limit of}} detection and a 25 % decrease in sensitivity for dopamine over 7 days, compared to undeterminable results arising from a severely degraded surface at bare <b>carbon</b> <b>electrodes.</b> During dopamine detection in vivo, 70 - 95 % of the dopamine oxidation current remained after the first 40 min of the experiment, and at least 50 % over the next 20 min.

25|$|Carbon {{arc lamps}} were started by making contact between two carbon electrodes, {{which were then}} {{separated}} to within a narrow gap.

The presence of edge planes of graphene at regular intervals along {{the walls of the}} bamboo nanotubes resulted in superior electrochemical performance relative to SWNT modified electrodes from two aspects. Firstly, with solution species the peak separation of the oxidation and reduction waves were smaller indicating more rapid rates of electron transfer. Secondly, a greater number of electroactive sites along the walls of the bamboo-carbon nanotubes (BCNTs) resulted in larger current signals and a broader dynamic range for the oxidation of DNA bases. <br /...|$|R

25|$|In 1800 Sir Humphry Davy {{discovered}} the short pulsed electric arcs. Independently a Russian physicist Vasily Petrov {{discovered the}} continuous electric arc in 1802 and subsequently proposed its possible practical applications, including welding. Arc welding was first developed when Nikolai Benardos presented arc welding of metals using a <b>carbon</b> <b>electrode</b> at the International Exposition of Electricity, Paris in 1881, which was patented together with Stanisław Olszewski in 1887. In the same year, French electrical inventor Auguste de Méritens also invented a carbon arc welding method, patented in 1881, which was successfully used for welding {{lead in the}} manufacture of lead-acid batteries. The advances in arc welding continued with the invention of metal electrodes in the late 19th century by a Russian, Nikolai Slavyanov (1888), and an American, C. L. Coffin. Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger released in Britain a coated metal electrode which gave a more stable arc. In 1905 Russian scientist Vladimir Mitkevich proposed the usage of three-phase electric arc for welding. In 1919, alternating current welding was invented by C.J. Holslag but did not become popular for another decade.|$|E
