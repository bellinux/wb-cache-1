40|$|Hansmann’s theory {{explains}} {{the success of}} the traditional (capitalistic) firm in terms <b>of</b> transaction <b>costs,</b> asserting that the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> incurred by capitalist are lower with respect to the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> contracting that other groups of patrons would have to incur for the acquisition of capital, through the instruments available to the market. The relatively low number of worker-owned firms, on the other hand, is mainly explained by the heterogeneity of the interests among the workers in a firm, which would lead to difficulties in taking collective decisions, thus sharply increasing the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> this group of patrons. Although Hansmann’s theory is a step forward with respect to the Ward-Vanek model, it does not fully explain why cooperatives take on the form of "quasi non-profit" firms in countries where they have greater importance, and above all, it does not fully explain their success, which indicates, at least in these cases, that there are none of the problems he emphasizes regarding collective decision-making, or that the "quasi non-profit" feature probably represents the tool for overcoming these difficulties...|$|R

Moreover, the transport sector in Mexico represents 44.7% of the total final consumption of energy, almost 17% more than the world average (28%). Thus, replacing low fuel efficient transport with alternative fuels is regarded as a considerable contribution to reduce 50% of its GHG emissions by the year 2050, as established by the General Law on Climate Change commitments. Therefore, incentives for PHEVs have been created both at regional and federal levels to decrease <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> for the end-consumers.|$|E

40|$|Ownership {{unbundling}} {{and third}} party access are discussed as two options of unbundling {{in both the}} literature and political discussions. Focusing on the South American electricity sector, I contrast static and dynamic impacts <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> unbundling and third party access regimes on customer prices. Substantially different results are found using dynamic rather than static analysis. In particular, negative short term effects <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> unbundling found in static models are approximately cancelled out by subsequent positive impacts in the dynamic model. Third party access seems to allow for similar benefits while avoiding the (restructuring) <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> unbundling.

Part of the airline's lower cost structure includes operation of McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets, which the airline can purchase and refurbish {{for as little}} as $4 million. While the aircraft are less fuel-efficient than newer planes, Allegiant is able to purchase used MD-80s outright for one-tenth the cost of a new Boeing 737 although Allegiant has subsequently purchased used Boeing 757-200s, Airbus A319s and Airbus A320s. (the 757s were acquired for its Hawaii service while the Airbus jets are beginning to replace MD-80 aircraft). [...] Given the low <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> Allegiant is able to operate its aircraft less (seven flight hours per day on average versus 13 hours per day at JetBlue Airways), which helps keep labor costs lower. Overall, Allegiant operates with 35 full-time workers per plane compared to more than 50 at other carriers. Allegiant schedules their crew members so that they always return to their domicile {{at the end of the}} day, thus avoiding the need for hotel rooms which can be a costly expense for airlines.|$|E
