40|$|Passive or {{active current}} {{balancing}} circuits are usually used to mitigate current imbalance in driving multiple light-emitting-diode (LED) strings. Passive current balancing schemes adopting capacitors with high reliability, small size and low cost are {{very popular in}} many applications. However, the high reactive power of the capacitive balancing scheme with variable frequency control will bring high power stress on the VA rating of the main switches which drive this passive current balancing circuit and decrease the overall efficiency. Fixed frequency control does not permit zero-voltage switching (ZVS) under load variations. Hence, this paper proposes a current-source-output LED driver based on LCLC resonant circuit to provide a constant output current regardless of variations in LED parameters. In the LCLC circuit, the number of additional capacitors is scalable {{with the number of}} LED strings for current balancing. Moreover, the input impedance of the improved LCLC circuit is designed to be resistive at the operating frequency to minimize reactive power. The <b>conventional</b> <b>duty</b> cycle control can easily incorporate ZVS. The analysis, implementation and verification are detailed in this paper.

40|$|A {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} that employs passive radio wake-up of the sensor nodes can reduce the energy cost for unnecessary idle listening and communication overhead, extending the network lifetime. A passive wake-up radio is powered by the electromagnetic waves transmitted by a wake-up transmitter rather than a battery on the sensor node. However, this method of powering the wake-up radio results in a short wake-up range, which limits {{the performance of a}} passive wake-up radio sensor network. In this article, we describe our design of a passive wake-up radio sensor node-REACH 2 -Mote-using a high-efficiency, energy-harvesting module and a very low power wake-up circuit to achieve an extended wake-up range. We implemented REACH 2 -Mote in hardware and performed field tests to characterize its performance. The experimental results show that REACH 2 -Mote can achieve a wake-up range of 44 feet. We also modeled REACH 2 -Mote and evaluated its performance through simulations, comparing its performance to that of another passive wake-up radio approach, an active wake-up radio approach, and a <b>conventional</b> <b>duty</b> cycling approach. The simulation results show that REACH 2 -Mote can significantly extend the network lifetime while achieving high packet delivery rate and low latency.

40|$|Although the <b>conventional</b> <b>duty</b> cycle MAC {{protocols}} for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) such as RMAC {{perform well}} {{in terms of}} saving energy and reducing end-to-end delivery latency, they were designed independently and require an extra routing protocol in the network layer to provide path information for the MAC layer. In this paper, we propose a new cross-layer duty cycle MAC protocol with data forwarding supporting a pipeline feature (P-MAC) for WSNs. P-MAC first divides the whole network into many grades around the sink. Each node identifies its grade according to its logical hop distance {{to the sink and}} simultaneously establishes a sleep/wakeup schedule using the grade information. Those nodes in the same grade keep the same schedule, which is staggered with the schedule of the nodes in the adjacent grade. Then a variation of the RTS/CTS handshake mechanism is used to forward data continuously in a pipeline fashion from the higher grade to the lower grade nodes and finally to the sink. No extra routing overhead is needed, thus increasing the network scalability while maintaining the superiority of duty-cycling. The simulation results in OPNET show that P-MAC has better performance than S-MAC and RMAC in terms of packet delivery latency and energy efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{last decade}} {{has been really}} ambitious in new {{research}} and development techniques to reduce energy consumption especially in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Sensor nodes are usually battery-powered and thus have very limited lifetime. Energy efficiency {{has been the most}} important aspect to discuss when talking about wireless body area network (WBAN) in particular, since it is the bottleneck of these networks. Medium access control (MAC) protocols hold the vital position to determine the energy efficiency of a WBAN, which is a key design issue for battery operated sensor nodes. The wake-up radio (WUR) based MAC and physical layer (PHY) have been evaluated in this research work in order to contribute to the energy efficient solutions development. WUR is an on-demand approach in which the node is woken up by the wake-up signal (WUS). A WUS switches a node from sleep mode to wake up mode to start signal transmission and reception. The WUS is transmitted or received by a secondary radio transceiver, which operates on very low power. The energy benefit of using WUR is compared with conventional duty-cycling approach. As the protocol defines the nodes in WUR based network do not waste energy on idle listening and are only awakened when there is a request for communication, therefore, energy consumption is extremely low. The performance of WUR based MAC protocol has been evaluated for both physical layer (PHY) and MAC for transmission of WUS and data. The probabilities of miss detection, false alarm and detection error rates are calculated for PHY and the probabilities of collision and successful data transmission for channel access method Aloha is evaluated. The results are obtained to compute and compare the total energy consumption of WUR based network with duty cycling. The results prove that the WUR based networks have significant potential to improve energy efficiency, in comparison to <b>conventional</b> <b>duty</b> cycling approach especially, in the case of low data-reporting rate applications. The duty cycle approach is better than WUR approach when sufficiently low duty cycle is combined with highly frequent communication between the network nodes...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{impressive}} strides made in international fisheries {{law in the}} sixteen years since the convening of the United Nations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, the state {{of most of the}} world’s fish stocks with which the conference was concerned continues to show little improvement. This is not because of any deficiency in the U. N. Fish Stocks Agreement adopted at the Conference, which as of July 1, 2008 has seventy-one parties, including the United States, the European Community and its twenty-seven member States, Japan, Canada, Russia, Norway, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, in other words most of the major players in international fisheries. The only calls for its revision at the 2006 Review Conference were from non-parties, and these were unconvincing. The standard explanation for the persistent gap between promise and performance has tended to be the slowness of regional fisheries management organizations to implement the Agreement’s solutions, despite the central role they are given by Articles 8 and 13. While there is some truth to this, in part because not all members of these commissions are parties to the Agreement, this Article argues that {{a significant part of the}} explanation is the conspicuous neglect of an essential legal tool in international fisheries discourse: the doctrine of State responsibility. This branch of international law can hold delinquent States accountable to other States for their acts and omissions contrary to their legal obligations. One of the reasons why so many stocks have been overfished to the point of sharply reduced productivity, or even collapse, is that States exerting a risky level of fishing pressure on the stocks have not been systematically visited with any adverse legal consequences before the point of collapse is reached, or for that matter, after. The only consequence they have had to face has been the collapse of the stock itself—a consequence that affects all other States with an interest in the stock, whether they have contributed to causing the collapse or not. In economic terms, States have been largely able to externalize the costs of their risk-taking, leading to levels of risk in the form of fishing pressure that are insufficiently precautionary not just from a biological viewpoint, but also from an economic one. Although there is no shortage of international fisheries documents in which the expression “State responsibility” occurs, it is invariably preceded either by “flag” or, rarely, “coastal” or “port,” and often in the plural, indicating that something other than State responsibility in the sense of public international law was in the drafters’ minds. In the sense in which it is used in these instruments, “responsibility” could easily be replaced by “duty,” “obligation,” or a similar term without a noticeable change in meaning. That is, the obligations here, to the extent that they exist, are primary and substantive, not the secondary duties associated with State responsibility that arise when a primary obligation is breached. It is similarly easy to find rhetorical references in fisheries commissions documents and elsewhere to “responsible fishing States,” and when used in this adjectival form the meaning is even less clear. The origin of this phrase appears to lie in the Cancún Declaration of 1992, where “responsible” seems to be no more than a term of general approbation devoid of any specific meaning. Subsequently, this use has been perpetuated by the soft-law Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. More disturbingly, there are now signs that other State responsibility terms have been appropriated for use in a sense quite foreign to that in which they appear in the International Law Commission (ILC) Draft Articles on State Responsibility. For example, an International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) recommendation otherwise drafted in orthodox legal language, used “counter-measures” where it bears no evident relationship to that concept as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness of a State’s acts as set out in Article 22. Countermeasures in its true meaning was raised not many years ago by Rosemary Rayfuse, as a way for the high seas boarding and inspection provisions in Part VI of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement (a significant departure from the long-established ordinary rule codified in Article 92, paragraph 1 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) that on the high seas the flag State of a vessel has exclusive jurisdiction over it) to be made opposable to non-parties to that treaty. Rayfuse argues that where a State persistently breaches its customary and, where applicable, <b>conventional,</b> <b>duty</b> to cooperate with other States and the institutions established by them in conserving high seas fish stocks, other States specially affected may board and inspect that State’s fishing vessels on the high seas. This would be by way of a proportionate response, satisfying the criteria for “resort to countermeasures” laid down in Article 22 of the ILC’s Draft Articles as a circumstance precluding the wrongfulness of the otherwise unlawful interference with the flag State’s exclusive jurisdiction. Provided the other necessary elements were present, such an argument might well have succeeded as a defense for Canada to the merits of the action brought against it by Spain over its actions on the high seas against the Spanish-flagged Estai in 1995, which was dismissed by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1998 for want of jurisdiction. On the other hand, since countermeasures by their very nature tend to be ad hoc responses to immediate exigencies, States are unlikely to adopt this approach as a preannounced policy, as they would then be admitting in effect their willingness to breach international obligations. The remainder of this Article is divided as follows: Section II considers in the abstract how certain basic State responsibility concepts could apply to internationally managed fisheries, and highlights some of the practical difficulties that may also have contributed to their neglect; Section III—the bulk of the Article—is a case study of how States’ practice in accounting to each other for their catches of southern bluefin tuna (SBT) has gradually evolved a “compliance” focus over the years that owes little to any systematic State responsibility framework; Section IV shows that this focus does not sufficiently discharge the member States’ responsibility to other States potentially able to enter the fishery in pursuance of their UNCLOS Article 116 right to fish on the high seas; and Section V offers some concluding thoughts as to how compliance can be reunited with State responsibility to benefit international fisheries...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the late}} 19 th Century, the {{military}} in Mexico {{has been an important}} instrument of the executive branch of government to maintain political stability. In the 1880 s, President Porfirio Diaz created the basis of a system of civil-military relations based on Presidential control (as opposed to civilian control). Since then, the Mexican armed forces have developed a unique bond with the President, remaining accountable and exclusively subordinated to this branch of power and no one else. Despite the Mexican Revolution {{in the first quarter of}} the 20 th Century and the subsequent process of democratization after 1988, Diaz's basic principle has not been broken. In fact, the military's separation from the political arena after the Mexican Revolution inexorably strengthened its moral capital, gaining the population's approval to participate in areas that surpass its <b>conventional</b> <b>duties.</b> This has made the executive branch become increasingly reliant on the armed forces to make certain policy commitments seem trustworthy, especially in areas where civilian agencies have consistently underperformed, such as the combat of organised crime and ordinary policing. This is definitely a unique characteristic within Latin America, where democratization has rarely been accompanied by an increasing role of the armed forces on internal affairs. By using deductive reasoning and historical narrative, the argument will propose that the rules governing the system of civil-military relations in Mexico are counterintuitive with the idea of democratic consolidation. It will also suggest that the current system of civilian control has become even more vulnerable due to the capacity of the military to resist and even reverse civilian initiatives to improve supervision over their expanding roles. To test these hypotheses, the argument follows closely the military's counterinsurgency policy and its increasing participation in law enforcement institutions...|$|R

50|$|To prevent V-1s {{falling in}} the city and dock area, the guns had to be {{positioned}} at least 10 miles outside the city, integrated into a system ('Antwerp X') of warning stations and observation posts, supported by radar and searchlights. 114th LAA Regiment provided some of the personnel and equipment for No 2 Local Warning (Radar) Troop formed by 80 AA Bde for this purpose. The Antwerp X deployment, including 114th LAA Rgt, took its full form in December 1944, in time for the peak in V-1 attacks that lasted into February 1945. In mid-January, 114th LAA Rgt redeployed some of its guns for AA rather than anti-minelaying <b>duties.</b> <b>Conventional</b> air attacks were rare, except on 1 January 1945, when the Luftwaffe launched Operation Bodenplatte against Allied airfields on support of the Ardennes offensive, and German aircraft approaching the city were heavily engaged by the AA guns.|$|R
40|$|Pollutants {{emissions}} and fuel economy tests for passenger cars differ from region to {{region of the}} world, since different driving condition and vehicle fleet characterize different geographical areas. In particular, the European type approval procedure for passenger cars uses as reference cycle the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), which is nowadays not representative of real driving conditions. Therefore, the European Commission has planned to introduce the Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Test Procedure (WLTP) from September 2017. As a consequence, the CO 2 emissions target should be adapted, since the current 2020 goals are based on NEDC assessment. The European Commission and the Joint Research Centre (JRC) are therefore developing a simulation tool called CO 2 MPAS (CO 2 Module for Passenger and commercial vehicles Simulation) for the correlation of CO 2 emissions from WLTP to NEDC, which {{will be used for}} the type approval of European passenger cars from 2017, avoiding expensive duplicate test campaigns for car manufactures. However, the implementation of CO 2 MPAS has so far involved solely <b>conventional</b> light <b>duty</b> vehicles. Within this context, a research project has been carried out in closed collaboration between Politecnico di Torino and JRC for the development of CO 2 MPAS for Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) and Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). The correlation model is based on a unique simplified physical approach, which should be able to detect the powertrain behavior along the NEDC cycle from the physical measurements along the new driving cycle, estimating with a good accuracy the CO 2 emissions (within ± 3 g/km) ...|$|R
40|$|A DCIP survey with {{different}} timing settings, electrode arrays, cable spreads and waveforms (50 % and 100 % duty cycle waveform) {{were carried out}} over the Liikavaara deposit in northern Sweden. All the measured data were inverted using AarhusInv. Measured data with 100 % duty cycle waveform, which is much faster than the <b>conventional</b> 50 % <b>duty</b> cycle waveform, present significant improvements {{in the quality of}} IP-data. It was also attempted to increase the data quality by separating current and potential cables. Tau and C parameters from time domain IP were compared in different time bases and spreads. These two parameters appear {{to be sensitive to the}} duration of current injections in which; decreasing the time base causes diminished anomalies in Tau and partly in C. Although measurement with separated spreads improved the data quality, it did not have any significant effect on these two parameters. Moreover correlation of sulphide content matched well with the inverted models, which confirms the applicability of the DCIP method in mineral exploration...|$|R
