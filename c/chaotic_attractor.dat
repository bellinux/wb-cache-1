2500|$|An {{easy way}} to {{visualize}} a <b>chaotic</b> <b>attractor</b> is {{to start with a}} point in the basin of attraction of the attractor, and then simply plot its subsequent orbit. Because of the topological transitivity condition, this is likely to produce a picture of the entire final attractor, and indeed both orbits shown in the figure on the right give a picture of the general shape of the Lorenz attractor. [...] This attractor results from a simple three-dimensional model of the Lorenz weather system. The Lorenz attractor is perhaps one of the best-known chaotic system diagrams, probably because it was not only one of the first, but {{it is also one of}} the most complex and as such gives rise to a very interesting pattern, that with a little imagination, looks like the wings of a butterfly.|$|E

50|$|In what {{is perhaps}} Ott's most {{well-known}} contribution, {{he and his colleagues}} Celso Grebogi and James A. Yorke introduced the concept of controlling chaos. In particular, they have shown that dynamics on a <b>chaotic</b> <b>attractor</b> can be controlled by using only small perturbations. The key idea in this work is that embedded within a <b>chaotic</b> <b>attractor</b> there are typically an infinite number of unstable periodic orbits, any one of which can be stabilized by a small control (the O.G.Y. method), and that, by properly choosing which orbit to stabilize, enhanced performance can be achieved. As part of its 50th anniversary celebration, the journal, Physical Review Letters, selected this paper as one of its milestone publications.|$|E

40|$|As {{a unique}} {{paradigm}} for chaos, the various versions of Chua’s circuits and equations {{consists of a}} three-dimensional autonomous system with a three-segment piecewise-linear function which gives rise to three equilibrium points. This paper considers the possibility of simplifying the system configurations of piecewise-linear chaotic systems based on the structures of Chua’s systems. We study {{a new class of}} piecewise-linear three-dimensional autonomous system with a three-segment piecewise-linear function. However, unlike Chua’s systems, the systems we study in this paper have only single equilibrium points. To find <b>chaotic</b> <b>attractors</b> from this class of systems, we use a systematic random-search process to search the parameter space. The searching process consists of three stages. For the first stage, we simply count the number of points on a Poincaré section and find candidates for <b>chaotic</b> <b>attractors.</b> At the second stage, Lyapunov exponents are calculated for selecting <b>chaotic</b> <b>attractors</b> from the candidates. Finally, bifurcation diagrams constructed around the located <b>chaotic</b> <b>attractors</b> are used to find different types of <b>chaotic</b> <b>attractors.</b> Many qualitatively different <b>chaotic</b> <b>attractors</b> of this class of systems had been found and presented in this paper. Another method to simplify the configurations of a piecewise-linear chaotic system is {{to reduce the number of}} segments of the piecewise-linear function. We have developed some chaotic systems with a two-segment piecewise-linear function and which gives rise to two equilibrium points. Many color illustrations of <b>chaotic</b> <b>attractors</b> and bifurcation diagrams are presented. 1...|$|R
