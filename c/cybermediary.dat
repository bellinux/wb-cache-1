40|$|Abstract: The paper {{analyzes}} {{the situation of}} intermediaries and their business models in the Swiss health system. Various intermediary roles are positioned within the value-added chain of the healthcare system. Particular {{attention is paid to}} cost-benefit relationships of intermediation for partners of the intermediary and for the intermediary itself. With regard to the connection between healthcare providers and health insurers, three intermediaries –namely the Trust Centers, Medidata, and H-Net – are featured in greater detail and studied in terms of differences of their business and revenue model. 1 Introduction Intermediation is defined asabrokering service between market partners. I n many business transactions, the handling ofservice exchanges between market participants is supported by intermediaries. These intermediaries may perform avariety offunctions.

40|$|Prior {{research}} has examined entrepreneurial businesses spatially {{located in the}} physical or offline context; however, recent radical information and technological breakthroughs allow entrepreneurs to launch their businesses completely online. The growth of the online business industry has been phenomenal. Predictions for worldwide online sales estimate it to reach $ 2 trillion in 2016. Virtual entrepreneurship refers to the pursuit and exploitation of opportunities via virtual platforms. Web 2. 0 cybermediaries offer web-based platforms that function similarly to traditional intermediaries in a virtual setting and minimize barriers to entry for virtual entrepreneurial firms. The use of such cybermediaries with increasing success suggests an implicit shift in the dominant logic that typically underpins the functioning of entrepreneurial firms operating in the physical world. In this relatively uncharted territory, marked by a focus on profit, cooperation, collaboration and community, three ideal-type institutional logics i. e. Market, Corporation and Community, blend together. It is posited that a Virtual Entrepreneurial Logic guides the norms, behaviors, and practices of entrepreneurial firms operating via these virtual platforms. This raises the question whether the blending of three ideal-type logics leads {{to the existence of}} different antecedents of performance. A business model antecedent addressing the economic dimension, a community antecedent addressing the community dimension and a co-creation antecedent addressing the collaborative dimension of the Virtual Entrepreneurial Logic were therefore empirically examined in this study. Thus, three research questions were investigated to explicate the antecedents. Primary data from 1396 virtual entrepreneurial firms was collected (business model antecedent n= 366, community antecedent n= 732 and co-creation antecedent n= 298) to test the proposed hypotheses. Results provided support for the three antecedents. This study makes important theoretical and practical contributions to understanding the domain of virtual entrepreneurship from a blended logics perspective. Using the theoretical lens provided by institutional logics helps shed light on the pivotal role played by <b>cybermediary</b> platforms in the Web 2. 0 context. The primary role of synergistic effects, cooperative behavior, and collaboration have important implications for virtual entrepreneurship. Findings also contribute to other related streams in entrepreneurship such as microenterprises. The study offers theoretical extensions of prior work on co-creation to virtual small entrepreneurial ventures. From a practical standpoint, insights can help entrepreneurs to better understand and leverage performance drivers in virtual contexts in general and on <b>cybermediary</b> platforms in particular...|$|E
40|$|Internet-based {{information}} and communication technologies (ICTs) have offered opportunities to reconfigure supply chains. A new kind of intermediary has emerged in many industries; the cybermediary—an online intermediary that only operates in the virtual environment. Many new types of online intermediary have emerged with differing business models. As yet, there have been few attempts to describe and categorise their e-business practices or to analyse the roles that they play within their supply chains. This paper seeks to address this deficiency by addressing both the theory and practise of online intermediaries. A two-dimensional framework based on the roles of cybermediaries and their relationships between supplier and buyer in the supply chain is developed from a synthesis of the extant literature. Five roles of cybermediaries are identified: informational, transactional, assurance, logistical and customisation. <b>Cybermediary</b> relationships are characterised in terms of their affiliation to customers and suppliers. Case studies of three online intermediaries are presented to illustrate and test the framework. An analysis of the empirical data from these cases served to demonstrate the utility of the framework in categorising online intermediaries and offering additional understandings of the rapidly evolving world of virtual supply chains...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} common early {{forecasts}} for commerce in the information age was the removal of wholesalers, distributors, and other intermediaries in a firm's value chain. This "disintermediation" offered the prospect of greater efficiency in supply and marketing channels. More recent evidence suggests that such forecasts were shortsighted, and today new "cybermediaries" have lodged themselves in the value chain between goods manufacturers and customers. This paper explains the phenomenon of cybermediation by looking beyond transaction cost economics toward newer theories of consumer economics and several theories drawn from the organization sciences: institutional theory, social exchange theory, social network theory, and theories of organizational knowledge creation. By acknowledging the potential contributions of these diverse theoretical perspectives, researchers may gain greater leverage in their attempts to explain the emergence of <b>cybermediaries</b> in electronic commerce.

The Internet represents a tool for travel agencies but {{can also be a}} powerful weapon against the traditional distribution. The process of breaking the usual distribution channels is known as disintermediation. Nowadays, in the travel industry, the majority of the travel agencies and tour operators have developed into “brick-and-click ” organizations – traditional operators who expanded into the e-commerce area, named <b>cybermediaries.</b> The competition between travel intermediaries is based on the need to reach the clients as directly and fast as possible, and the Internet comes to fulfill this issue.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} a better {{understanding}} of the ways in which the Internet supports the consumer decision process of potential customers in an online car retail environment. The thesis is mainly focused on how this can be done in South Africa. A case study approach was adopted in investigating the case of McCarthy Call-a-Car. Interviews were carried out with McCarthy Call-a-Car employees and documents and the Call-a-Car website, were analysed. It was revealed that Call-a-Car focuses on using the Internet to support customers in the pre-purchase phase only. The purchase and post-purchase phases are carried out offline at its dealership network and Club McCarthy respectively. The findings showed that Call-a-Car views the Internet as a marketing tool that provides convenience to customers searching for product information in the pre-purchase phase. The interviews revealed that due to Call-a-Car's strategy, as well as practical problems of selling online, the customer will still have to visit a dealership to conclude a purchase and for post-purchase support. From this research it appears that there are three main issues arising out of Call-a-Car's usage of the Internet in the customer buying process: firstly, the research revealed that instead of cutting out the middle-man, the Internet has created new types of intermediaries called "cybermediaries" and that Call-a-Car is one such intermediary. Secondly, it was revealed that trust is crucial in the online environment and that Call-a-Car builds trust through branding. Thirdly, the Internet has not affected prices online, despite theoretical estimations that the Internet would induce lower prices. The main recommendations for future research are empirical studies to investigate if the <b>cybermediary</b> model is unique to the car industry and whether this business model could be applied to other look and feel industries such as real estate. Future studies could also investigate the mechanics of trust-building and brand-building in the online environment and finally, studies from the customer perspective considering what Internet tools the customer would like to see online to support them during their buying decision process...|$|E
40|$|European {{publishing}} {{companies are}} quickly digitizing their businesses to achieve cost savings, and increased market reach and penetration. IT is increasingly affecting {{the ways in}} which the whole value chain operates. Interaction and collaboration costs have been slashed. Physical assets are no longer the cornerstone of competitive success and value propositions. This situation became more critical mainly due to continuous increase in consumer expectations, longer demand chain, conventional mechanism for information flow resulting into poor information visibility, and use of traditional demand forecasting methods. All above issues increase marketing and distribution costs significantly resulting into under performance of firms in the hyper-competitive scenario. Electronic markets are still far from reaching a state of maturity resulting in a difficult task to safely predict the possible transformation in the distribution system structure in the IT environment. This research is an attempt to develop a strategic IT enabled demand chain management model for European publishing companies to enhance efficiency for longterm performance and gaining sustainable competitive advantage. Major results of the study are as follow: • Brand management is the most important function of marketing for the present followed by distribution channel management, advertising, sales promotion, logistics, sales administration and management, and demand forecasting and management. • Main objectives behind the growing importance of distribution are higher growth and long-term performance of business, greater market dominance and coverage, sustainable competitive advantage, cost containment, and partnering channel 7 relationships. It is because of the fact that product, price and promotion no more bring long-term competitive advantage. Distribution channel strategy is always a wellstructured system, meant for long-term and based on the philosophy of relationships, which is very difficult to copy by competitors. • Traditionally, advertising was used for brand building and management. But in the prevailing new emerging environment, emphasis is more on sales promotion and trade promotion instead of advertising. In other words, focus of promotion is more on point-of-sale brand building and management. • Information technology (IT) further complicates the whole gamut of distribution. It provides an additional channel of distribution as well as increases the magnitude of competition. It is also a new and powerful information medium for producers, wholesalers and retailers to conduct business among each other enhancing interactivity, productivity, transaction efficiency, and relationships facilitating firms in optimization of resources and containment of total cost. • Marketing intermediaries add two types of values namely, logistical and marketing values addition. Intermediaries closer to the firm add high logistical value and less marketing value. Whereas, intermediaries closer to consumers add high logistical as well as marketing values to prevent stock-out. • Multi-tier distribution system is prevailing in most of the industrial sectors barring publishing industry. In the new environment, there is every possibility of transformation in the distribution channel structure. These changes may be in the form of disintermediation and/or reintermediation. Disintermediation can be partial or complete (cybermediation). Whereas, reintermediation can be in the form of infomediary and intermediary empowerment. • European publishing firms do not prefer <b>cybermediary</b> for mass marketing. Some firms have Internet distribution system but only for niche markets like, institutional markets, highly premium products/brands. In the situation of partial disintermediation, most of the firms would like to prefer C&F agents in the case of publisihing companies. In no case, they have chosen retailers/dealers. The concept of infomediary is not prevailing in Europe at present but consumer respondents prefer to collect information from the Internet and then physically verify books at stores before 8 making purchase decisions. Hence, there is a bright future of infomediary in Europe. Most of the European publishing companies are in the process of integrating their demand chain members (C&F agents and stockiest) on the web for their empowerment. The overwhelming highlights of this system include containment of costs, working methodology, transparency and real-time availability of information regarding order-status, shipment schedules, replies of inquiries, credit status, stockstatus, etc. making them feel significant and committed to achieve predetermined objectives, team spirited, and excited about their work. • Partnering channel relationships is an important issue of demand chain management. It is essential to keep channel members happy, loyal and well motivated for higher growth and long-term performance of business. Furthermore, all publishing firms under study have integrating by negotiation strategy for resolution of channel conflicts. Altogether 21 factors have been identified for partnering relationships. These factors have been grouped in nine key relationship factors (KRF) on the basis of nature and characteristics. Accordingly, 5. 76 is the maximum value assigned to various aspects related to availability of products and minimum value 4. 36 given to zero-defect delivery. Out of nine factors, two factors (prompt information sharing about changes in product profile, sales policy and promotional schemes, and point-topoint information about order status, shipment/delivery schedule and tracking of movement of shipment) are having information components solely. Whereas, the efficiency of remaining seven factors can be significantly improved by the extensive use of information technology. These factors include quick responsiveness for regular availability of products as per normal and unforeseen requirements, no stock-out and fulfillment of delivery commitment, consistency in trade related service quality, prompt logistics system for recovery from defective delivery, reasonable return on investment and infrastructure, fixed and smaller replenishment cycle time, commitment for long-term association, and zero-defect delivery. IT enabled Demand Chain Management Business Model On the basis of above results, a new business model has been proposed for demand chain management taking into consideration existing issues and challenges in the new 9 environment. Value proposition of the model has been redefined in terms of “RESPECT” (Reasonable return, Efficiency, Speed, Economy of Scale, Collaboration, and Trust). For the fulfillment of above value proposition, the requirement of information will be comprehensive and its speedy flow across the demand chain, which also needs interface with firm’s ERP and SCM systems. Hence, proposed business model is an IT enabled demand chain management. The highlights of this model are hyper-responsive, partnering relationships, shared value and knowledge, and value-added service. This model also addresses the scope of disintermediation and reintermediation, prevention of unnecessary stockpiles across the demand chain, and cost reduction. The proposed IT enabled demand chain management solutions are based on certain underlying philosophical principles. It includes minimize the number of layers, adopt pull based push strategy, provide a common view of demand, have business intelligence for optimization, develop multiple supply network, continuous replenishment in small quantity, and information transparency and visibility across the demand chain. The proposed model is being validated for its feasibility, scope for use and successful implementation in the European publishing sector. On the basis of opinion of experts (top corporate executives heading distribution function), various strategic initiatives have been proposed for successful implementation of new demand chain management system. It includes collaborative planning and scheduling, training and education to demand chain members, demand chain partnering relationships, pro-active demand-driven breakthrough culture, vendor managed inventory system, and customer portfolio management. It is uniquely hyper-responsive linkage between major demand chain partners. To transcend this, however, it requires a broad understanding of marketing and distribution, sharing of information between parties and the development of personal rapport between mangers at a number of levels in all organizations of demand chain for real time quick response. Information technology can support internal operations and collaboration between demand chain members. By the use of high-speed data networks and databases, firms can share data with its business partners to better manage the whole value chain. That is why, the effective use of this technology is a key aspect of firm’s success. All information systems are composed of technology that performs three main functions namely, data capture and communication, data storage and retrieval, and data manipulation and reporting. Various IT enabled managerial processes have been proposed for the optimization of the value of the new model. It include order management, demand planning and forecasting system, inventory management system, transportation planning and scheduling system, leveraging relationship system, advance planning and scheduling system, ERP system, and SCM system. For the evaluation and control purposes, a performance scorecard has also been proposed addressing various strategic and functional aspects. Strategic factors include return on assets to firm, return to channel members, order/replenishment cycle time, demand forecast accuracy, profit margin, on-time shipment, inventory turns, cash conversion cycle, sales growth, and marketing and distribution costs. Functional factors deal with frequency of stock-out, defective delivery, real-time information sharing and quality of decision, transparency of system, shared value and customer loyalty, frequency of channel conflict, effectiveness of promotional policies, collaborative planning, scheduling and innovation, resource pooling and risk sharing, and customer support for excellence...|$|E

It does so by considering {{the impact of the}} Web on the various players in an auction and classifying types of auctions. The hypothesized impacts are briefly compared with the case of an established auction firm that moved to the Web and the market domain in which it operates. This is then used to contribute to the electronic markets debate and develop some hypotheses about the way in which Web-based markets that use auction mechanisms may evolve. Trust and quality are identified as key attributes of auctions that may result in a "move to the middle" rather than the establishment of purer market mechanisms.

40|$|This PhD {{submission}} is by publication. It {{is based}} on the premise that marketing is fundamentally changing and evolving as a result of the impact of new technology. The conceptual ideas for the research emanated in 1998 and provided the basis for exploration until 1992. From wide ranging research it was found that company distribution strategies were changing as a result of the utilisation of <b>cybermediaries.</b> The Internet offers a cheaper and more radical marketing channel for smaller companies that can offer direct shipping to customers. In terms of undertaking research it was found that research on the Internet posed many problems that were related to individual skill sets, privacy considerations and the extent of email usage, including defunct email addresses. Company marketing effectiveness on the web depends on web capabilities that were identified and also the degree of co-ordination with designers. Companies also adopted reactive, interactive or passive marketing strategies depending on the time that they were in the Internet. Increasingly companies are also using the Internet for PR purposes. To this extent the accepted marketing paradigm of the four Ps is changing irrevocably. The diverse range of research methodologies, reflecting the post modern age and the limitations of the range of research is discussed. The thesis concludes by discussing how ethical marketing, customer relationship management (CRM), reputation and wireless communication are likely to change marketing strategies even further in the future.

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} {{and analyses}} the emerging Website genre of Resource Centre Sites. RCSs are sites which combine news, rumours and background information {{as well as}} community discussion and commentary on their chosen topic, and frequently serve as a first point of entry for readers interested in {{learning more about the}} field. They also offer spaces for virtual communities of specialists or enthusiasts to emerge, who in the process and as a product of their interaction on these sites collate detailed resource collections and hyperlink directories for their fields of interest. Therefore, Resource Centre Sites significantly involve their users as content contributors and producers, turning them into what is here termed produsers of the site. Aiming to evaluate all the content relevant to their field that is becoming available online, and to coopt or at least link to this information from the news and resources collection that is a central part of the RCS, Resource Centre Site produsers engage in an adaptation of both traditional journalistic gatekeeping methodologies and librarianly resource collection approaches to the Web environment: in the absence of gates to keep online, they have become gatewatchers, observing the publication of news and information in other sources and publicising its existence through their own sites. Their operation is studied here through a number of case studies of major existing Resource Centre Sites from various fields of interest. These sites are analysed both based on their available Web content, and using background information obtained in a series of email interviews with RCS creators. In combination, this offers insights into the operating philosophies of sites and site editors, and provides an opportunity to assess to what extent these ideas have been translated into everyday practice. Chapter 1 provides an overview of past and current theoretical views of the Web in an effort to evaluate their suitability for the current study. Older approaches positing an abstract ideal form of hypertext are rejected in favour of a direct engagement with the World Wide Web as the now dominant mode of hypertextuality. Chapter 2 outlines the principles of gatewatching in contrast to traditional methods of evaluating news and information as they exist in journalistic media and archival institutions, and investigates the effects such gatewatching practices may have on editors and users. Chapter 3 describes the overall characteristics of Resource Centre Sites as a genre of Web publications. It notes the special role site users play in the operation of such sites (in their new role as produsers), and distinguishes the RCS genre from similar Website models such as portals and <b>cybermediaries.</b> Chapter 4 observes the everyday operation of such Websites in practice, using case studies of major existing Resource Centre Sites including Slashdot, MediaChannel and CountingDown, and interviews with their creators. (These interviews are included in full in the Appendix.) This analysis works with both a synchronic view to the variety of topics existing Resource Centre Sites are able to address, and a diachronic view to the evolution of proto-RCSs (such as enthusiast community or online advocacy sites) into fully-featured Resource Centre Sites. Finally, based on this analysis, Chapter 5 is then able to point out some of the implications and effects that increasing use of this media form may have on its users and the network of news and information publications on- and offline, and to indicate the potential for further developments of the site genre...|$|R
