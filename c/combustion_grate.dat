40|$|To avoid extreme {{temperatures}} and reducing conditions along <b>combustion</b> <b>grate</b> surfaces {{reducing the risk}} of grate material deterioration-the configuration and out-placing of air passages through a grate have been investigated by mathematical modeling. In the two-dimensional CFD-simulations of wood-char combustion On top of the grate, the number and width of the air passages through the grate were varied. The different grate configurations were further investigated for different air flux rates and for the recirculation of flue gases to the combustion air. The results of the simulation; show that the maximal temperature in the grate is sensitive to the amount of air fed to the bed and,,at constant air flow rate, to the entering velocity of the combustion air to the fuel bed. The possibility of using the air flow, as a control parameter in modern grate :Furnaces is limited, due to a general wish to reduce the air flow through the grate to reduce nitric oxide emissions. Extreme temperatures in the grate should, therefore, according to the modelin;, be avoided by making sure that the entering velocity of the air to the Fuel bed is sufficiently high. Practically, this can be achieved by reducing the number of passages in the grate, or by introducing flue-gas recycling. However, to avoid areas of reducing conditio as along the grate, the number of passages should not be reduced further than resulting in a maximal distance of 4 - 5 cm between them, when working with pure air...|$|E

The <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> process involves drying, devolatilization, gasification/combustion and char burn-out. Also gasification and pyrolysis are subsets of combustion. Mathematical modeling of <b>combustion</b> on the <b>grate</b> requires determining the flow field and concentrations of gaseous species in a reacting and moving bed, {{taking into account}} various heat transfer mechanisms. Development of an accurate mathematical model of the incineration process {{is limited by the}} lack of measured data for validation.

It is applicable to all kind of combustion systems traditionally used for power generation (pulverized fuel, fluidized bed <b>combustion</b> and <b>grate</b> firing). Co-firing in cement kilns is already a quite widespread solution for valorization of waste materials mostly, as well as for biomass.

40|$|Combustion {{of fixed}} fuel beds in grate {{furnaces}} {{is one of}} the most common techniques within production of heat and power from solid fuels. The grate furnace used to be a working horse for combustion of hard coal, while today the incitement of using renewable fuel sources has turned biomass and municipal waste into dominating fuel types. These fuels are more conveniently managed by the robust grate furnace than by, for example, fluidised bed or suspension boilers. However, the introduction of the, in many cases, complicated and heterogeneous biomass and waste fuels have, while at the same time subjected to increasingly stringent demands on efficiency and emission of harmful substances, given rise to diffuse challenges to the operation and design of grate furnaces. The influence of the heterogeneous fuels and the low air flow rate required for low nitric oxide emissions are, to a large extent, unclear. The outcome is that different furnaces not only rely on diverging strategies of design and operation – they also show a variety of disturbance characteristics. To make way for more efficient use of modern biomass fuels in grate furnaces, by improving the understanding of the combustion situation and disturbance characteristics, the following steps were made in this study: (1) a set of grate furnaces were investigated separating hands-on problems from underlying research oriented questions, (2) three methods for detecting and measuring disturbances in grate furnaces were developed, and (3) the fundamentals behind disturbances in the part of a fuel bed of grate furnace dominated by char conversion were addressed by mathematical modelling. The outcome of the inventory of furnaces is that fuel-bed channelling and grate material deterioration are common – the first causing increased emissions of unburned carbon compounds and nitric oxides, while the latter giving rise to high material costs and operation failures. In some furnaces, the disturbances could be detected by logical reasoning and visual observations while abated by hands-on adjustments to the fuel handling, operation conditions or grate design. The continued study adds two instruments to further improve this category: (1) a method of video recording inside furnaces to detect, quantify and fend off disturbing channelling, and (2) a new method of on-line monitoring of the fuel moisture content to detect disturbing changes in fuel moisture content during operation. Furthermore, a third developed method of analysing the residence time field of the gas flow in a furnace by mathematical modelling provides an opportunity to optimise the furnace chamber for both steady conditions and transient disturbances. The inventory of furnaces also identified some fundamental question marks concerning the conversion of the fuel bed – how channels in the fuel bed arise and how these disturbances may be avoided, also during low combustion air flow, without causing grate-material deterioration. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling of two-dimensional conversion of a fixed char bed was developed and used for investigating these matters, in which it was confirmed that a provoked change of bed porosity may cause process disturbing channelling. An obvious solution to avoid bed-channelling is, therefore, to create an as homogeneous fuel bed as possible. However, the structure of the fuel bed may only to a certain extent be affected; the low cost of the inferior quality fuel is, to a large extent, attributable to the fact that it is heterogeneous and, furthermore, advanced fuel pre-treatments drastically reduce the economical outcome. Thus, the most powerful parameter to avoid disturbances in a heterogeneous fuel bed is to manipulate the distribution of air by means of grate design. Here, a considerable flow resistance across the grate – an effect which may be achieved by reducing the amount and/or size of the air holes in the grate rods – was found to dampen channelling. The CFD modelling, however, indicates that the placing or shaping of these holes, under certain circumstances during the char conversion, may cause thermal and/or carburizing material deterioration – one of the most common disturbances in the inventory of furnaces. Consequently, recommendations for placing of holes along the lower part of a <b>combustion</b> <b>grate,</b> counter-acting the risk of grate material deterioration, could be given from the modelling outcome. These recommendations, which also include recirculation of flue-gases into the combustion air, may in a straight forward manner be applied to the design of future grate furnaces to improve the combustion of heterogeneous fuel beds...|$|E

40|$|When {{rape oil}} is {{chemically}} extracted, rape seed meal, a solid residue remains. Currently, {{it is used}} as animal feed. Several plants {{for the production of}} rape methyl ester (RME, biodiesel) are in operation or under construction. Combustion properties have been studied for rape seed meal produced as a by product to rape-methyl esther (RME, biodiesel). Composition of the material has been measured, using proximate and ultimate analysis. The lower heating value was 18. 2 ± 0, 3 MJ/kg d. w. and the ash content was 7 - 8 percent d. w. The material is rich in nitrogen and sulphur. Concentrations of K, P, Ca and Mg are high in the fuel. Rape seed meal was mixed with bark and pelletised. Bark pellets were also used as a reference fuel. Pellets with 10 and 30 percent rape seed meal were produced. Material with 80 percent rape seed meal and 20 percent planer shavings was also pelletised. Wood had to be added to provide enough friction in the pelletising process, with adapted equipment rape seed meal could probably be easily pelletised). The material was studied using Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), and compared with data from tests with wood powder. The pyrolysis of the rape seed meal has a characteristic temperature of 320 oC. Devolatilisation starts at 150 oC (at a lower temperature than for wood powder), and proceeds within a rather wide temperature range. The probable cause is the difference in organic content, in particular protein content. The result does not suggest that the material will be difficult to ignite. Experiments in a bench-scale fluidised bed (5 kW) showed that pellets containing only bark, and the mixture rape seed meal/wood had a bed agglomeration temperature well over the normal operational bed temperature. For the fuel mixtures rape seed meal and bark, the agglomeration temperature was slightly over the operational temperature. Particle emissions from fluidised bed <b>combustion</b> and <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> were, the latter simulated using a commercial pellet burner, were roughly doubled with fuels containing rape seed meal compared to bark. In the powder burner tests, particle emissions increased with a factor 17 with rape seed meal compared to wood powder. The emitted particles were mainly found in the fine (1 µm) and a fine mode fraction. The particles from <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> of bark contain mostly K, S, Na and Cl apart from oxygen and carbon. When rape seed meal is present, Cl and Na concentrations decrease considerably and the main contents of the particles are K and S (and O and C). The results from the X-ray Diffraction Spectroscopy (XRD) analyses showed the presence of crystalline K 2 SO 4 och KCl. The fine particles (< 1 µm) from powder combustion contain mainly K, P and S. The only identified crystalline phase was K 2 SO 4, suggesting that most phosphorus was in the amorphous phase, i. d. most probably molten. The deposit formation on a cooled probe was studied during the fluidized bed and powder combustion experiments. The fine particles deposited during fluidised bed combustion contained K, Cl and S. When bark was combusted in the fluidised bed, the coarse fraction contained Ca and Si, when rape seed meal in different mixes was combusted this changed to P, K, Ca and Mg. The deposits formed during combustion of rape seed meal in the powder burner were mainly made up of phosphates (Ca-, Mg/K-, Ca/Mg-phosphates) and MgO. Sintered material (slag) from <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> of bark contained mainly Si, Ca, K and Al, probably as silicates. Adding rape seed meal tended to increase P, Ca and Mg while Si and Ca content tended to decrease. Through XRD a number o crystalline phases in the sintered material {{and the rest of the}} bottom ashes could be identified. NO emissions from the combustions tests increased two to four times with rape seed meal compared to typical wood fuels. For the fluidised bed test, SO 2 concentrations were rather high for the rape seed meal pellets (with 20 percent wood), still only about 20 percent of the sulphur in the fuel formed SO 2. For the <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> and powder burner combustion, 60 percent and 70 percent of the sulphur respectively formed SO 2. HCl emissions were low for all tests. The rather high emissions of NOx and SOx mean that the material should be used in large-scale facilities with external SOx and NOx cleaning. In smaller facilities, the material may be used in small amounts mixed with other fuels. The risk of slagging is not very high, and should not rule out <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> of pellets with rape seed meal mixed with other fuels. The risk of corrosion of superheater surfaces during combustion is probably low since the smaller-size particles formed at fluidised bed <b>combustion</b> and <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> contain K 2 SO 4. However, a large fraction of the particles formed in powder burner combustion probably contains low temperature melting K 2 PO 4, making the risk for deposit formation significant. Rape seed meal for powder burner applications should be used with care. The content of phosphorus in the material may be an advantage when mixes of rape seed meal and other fuels are considered. The high affinity between potassium and phosphorus means that more sulphur in the fuel will be available for sulphatising of any KC. (formed from combustion of many forest and agricultural fuels). Use of rape seed meal as a sulphur containing additive could thus be an option. For <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> and fluidised bed combustion, addition of rape seed meal may reduce the risk of slagging and bed agglomeration, respectively. Full scale tests in fluidised beds or grate combustors with problematic biofuels (containing Cl and K) would be useful to test whether ash-reduced operational problems could be reduced through the addition of rape seed meal. Effektiva värmevärdet hos rapsmjöl är 18, 2 +/- 0, 3 MJ/kg TS och askhalten varierar mellan 7 - 8 %. Bränslet har högt N- och S-innehåll, och bränslet är rikt på K, P, Ca och Mg. Partikelemissionerna från fluidbäddseldning och rosterförbränning med rapsmjölsblandningar var ungefär dubbelt så höga som från barkförbränning. Vid pulverförbränning av rapsmjöl ökade partikelemissionerna med en faktor 17 jämfört med träpulver. De höga NOx och SOx emissionerna från rapsmjölsförbränning innebär att materialet bör utnyttjas i storskaliga anläggningar med extern svavel. - eller NO-rening, eller i relativt låga inblandningsgrader i andra bränslen. Mindre anläggningar med enbart cyklonrening är olämpliga på grund av de höga stofthalterna.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of waste (particularly of municipal solid waste) that cannot be minimized, recycled or reused presents a huge international problem. The last 20 years {{is characterized by a}} gradual transition from landfilling of the municipal solid waste (MSW) to incineration. The incineration of MSW under existing legislation and operational boundary conditions is a very complex process with the application of two-stage combustion, minimization of emissions and production of energy (generally heat and electricity). In MSW incinerators, the first stage consists of combustion of heterogeneous waste on a moving grate that transports and mixes the waste during the <b>combustion</b> process. The <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> process involves drying, devolatilization, gasification/combustion and char burn-out. Thus, gasification and pyrolysis are subsets of the combustion problem. Mathematical modeling of <b>combustion</b> on the <b>grate</b> requires the solution of the flow field and concentrations of gaseous species in a reacting and moving bed, taking into account various heat transfer mechanisms. Development of an accurate mathematical model of the incineration process is limited by the lack of measured data for validation. Requirements for specific (in-situ) data essential for the development of an incinerator burning bed model and {{a better understanding of the}} <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> process prompted accurate measurement of concentrations of selected gases within a moving, burning bed of solid waste. For this purpose we have designed and developed a special cube-capsule with insulating refractory ceramic fibres and materials with cooling effects enabling measurements of CO and temperature by an electrochemical sensor, small gas pump and electronics placed inside. This unique self-contained and mechanically/thermally protected probe consisting of measuring and recording electronic components was able to withstand temperatures over 1000 °C for a period longer than two hours. The measurement technique differs from all conventional methods of measurements in that the capsule (casket) can be introduced into the incinerator together with the waste and hence experiences the same conditions on the grate as the waste material. This novel device proved to be convenient for in-situ measurements in moving grate incineration. The capsule with sensor for CO measurement passed through three incinerator furnaces burning MSW and recorded CO concentration and two temperatures on opposing sides of the capsule, saving all data onto a computer memory chip. The cube-capsule was recovered from the incinerator ash pit and the recorded information was downloaded onto an Excel spreadsheet for subsequent analysis. A similar capsule/casket being designed with thermal insulation/cooling could be used for simultaneous measurement of CO, oxygen, CO 2 (or pollutants as HCl) and temperatures to characterize the combustion process of waste. A vibration sensor, detection of casket position on the grate and measurement of temperatures and intake of gas samples from more surface positions will further improve the record of the trajectory/rolling of the capsule, to elucidate the effects of horizontal and vertical distance on the grate within the furnace and the overall history (residence time in various sections) experienced on the grate by waste.

40|$|Biomass <b>combustion</b> in <b>grate</b> fired {{furnaces}} is {{an important}} approach to convert renewable biomass fuel to heat and electricity. It is not only used in the Swedish energy industry but also by {{a great number of}} Swedish households for domestic heating. Burning biomass has the advantage of being CO 2 neutral. However, it suffers from several difficulties, for example, the poor combustion efficiency ? there are considerable amount of emissions of unburned volatile gases and solid fuel particles. The emission of pollutants such as NOx, CO, dioxin, and also particulate matters, etc, damages our environment and has caused great public concern. To meet the stringent legislation on environment protection, efficient and clean biomass combustion furnaces must be developed. To achieve this goal, understanding of the biomass combustion process must be improved by systematic scientific investigations on the processes, and reliable simulation and design tools must be developed. The aims of this thesis work are to study the fundamental details of biomass combustion in grate-fired boilers by using computational methods, and to develop and validate modelling tools to study biomass combustion. The three major aspects of biomass <b>combustion</b> in <b>grate</b> fired boilers have been studied. They are the combustion process in the fuel bed, the volatile combustion process in the free board and the radiation heat transfer process in the free board and between the flames and the fuel bed. Sub-models for these different processes have been developed and validated against available experimental data. A two-zone and a three-zone bed model for biomass combustion are developed based on the functional group concept and an existing coal combustion model. To account for the spatial inhomogeneity of the fuel bed, a detailed quasi two-dimensional bed model considering detailed transport inside each particle has been developed. The two-zone model (for counter-current beds) and the three-zone model as well as the quasi two-dimensional model (for cross-current beds) are applied to simulate the volatile compositions from the bed. The gas phase combustion process in the free board is modelled using Favre averaged Navier-Stokes equations, together with transport equations for enthalpy and mass fractions of different species. Turbulence is taken into account by the two-equation k-epsilon closure. The chemical reactions are modelled using global mechanisms for both the oxidation of volatiles and for the NOx emissions and re-burning. Different NOx models have been investigated. Several different radiation models for the radiation heat transfer process in the free board have been investigated, including the P 1 model and the FVM model. In addition, assumptions of optical thick and optically thin have been examined in different boiler applications. In addition to the model development and validation, an efficient boundary correction method has been developed to remedy the stiffness problem in modelling the various small secondary air jets in large scale boilers. Two large-scale grate-fired district heating boilers, one small-scale household heating boiler and one laboratory scale pellets-fired reactor have been studied within the thesis work. The studies have revealed the important features in grate fired biomass boilers. For example, it was shown that turbulence plays important role in the volatile oxidation process ? the laboratory scale pellet reactor study showed that the turbulence level in the primary combustion zone has a dominant influence on the temperature and species distributions. The study of a large scale 50 MW industry boiler has demonstrated the advantage and potential of the computational methods in future boiler analysis and design. The present thesis work has also shown the complexity of the process and limitations of the models investigated.

40|$|Co-combustion {{of biomass}} or waste {{together}} with a base fuel in a boiler is a simple and economically suitable way to replace fossil fuels by biomass and to utilise waste. Co-combustion in a high-efficiency power station means utilisation of biomass and waste with a higher thermal efficiency than what otherwise had been possible. Due to transport limitations, the additional fuel will only supply a minor part (less than a few hundreds MWfuel) of the energy in a plant.

40|$|Conversion {{of solid}} fuels in fixed beds {{is a common}} method for heat and power production. A {{frequent}} fixed-bed technique in small to medium scale is <b>combustion</b> in <b>grate</b> furnaces. Grate furnaces are widely used in the industrial energy branch and appreciated for their stability and simplicity of control. Also, the fuel flexibility makes the method economically attractive as an energy supplier to district heating systems. With increasing demands on combustion efficiency and fuel flexibility, it has been observed, though, that the fuel bed in grate furnaces often suffers from disturbances causing problems in the fuel bed and in the free-board above it, such as elevated emissions and increased material wear. To reduce these problems {{it is important to}} gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} processes in the fuel bed, both by practical investigations and modelling. An inventory of disturbances in the fuel bed of grate furnaces was carried out, in which interviews with operating personnel and recordings of fuel beds with a video camera, was made. The results show that disturbances in the fuel bed are very common. Most frequent is channelling in the fuel bed and at the bounding walls, which occur naturally at walls of packed beds and in connection with local changes in bed porosity. The inventory shows that a range of practical measures in the operation of grate furnaces amplify this phenomenon. Modelling of combustion in the free-board of a grate furnace and in the fixed fuel bed was performed. The free-board modelling was carried out with a numerical software, using a simplified bed model to describe the inlet conditions from the fuel bed. The results clearly emphasise the practicability of such a combination and effects that are difficult to foresee by measurements and observations are highlighted. A zone in the furnace that is poorly exploited by the combustion process was revealed by the computation, and an alternative design was evaluated. The first steps in creating a bed model that describes the processes in a burning bed of char were also taken. The model was implemented into a commercial software and enriched with model-specific functions. Emphasis was put on describing a two-dimensional flow, including spatial variations in flow conditions and their influence on bed porosity and shrinkage, which enables modelling of channel formation in fixed beds...|$|R

40|$|Residues from {{biochemical}} {{production of}} liquid transport biofuels will probably become available for energy use if more gasoline and diesel is substituted. For processes used in northern Europe they amount to 35 - 65 % of the feedstock energy and despite interest from energy companies, their fuel properties are largely unknown. Combustion-relevant material properties have been characterized and fuel-specific combustion properties determined for powder-, grate- and fluidized bed combustion. Suitable combustion applications have been identified. A techno-economic evaluation of utilization of a selected residue for supplying process heat and electricity to the transport biofuel production, combined with sale of surplus energy has been done. Residues studied are rape-seed meal (RM) from biodiesel production, wheat distillers dried grain with solubles (wheat DDGS) from grain-based ethanol production and hydrolysis residue (HR) from wood-based ethanol production. For RM and wheat DDGS, mixtures with typical forest- and agricultural fuels were also studied. Combustion experiments were {{performed in a}} fluidized (quartz) bed (5 kW), an under-fed pellet burner (12 kW), and in a powder burner (150 kW). The calorific value for HR was higher than for wood, for RM and wheat DDGS it was similar to wood. More char was produced from HR, otherwise TGA results showed that thermal kinetics was similar to wood for all fuels. All pulverized residues had better feeding properties than wood powder. While RM and wheat DDGS ash contents were higher than for most common forest and also for some agricultural fuels, HR mostly had very low contents of ash, alkali, Cl, S and N. RM and DDGS had high concentrations of S, N, K and P compared to most other biomass fuels. RM had higher Ca and Mg concentrations than DDGS. The Cl content of wheat DDGS was similar to wheat straw, while RM had a lower Cl content, similar to wood. Combustion of all pulverized residues was stable with CO emissions not higher than for wood powder. While the bed agglomeration tendency of RM was low and comparable to many forest fuels the wheat DDGS bed agglomeration tendency was high and comparable to wheat straw. The K, P and Si contents of wheat DDGS formed layers of K-phosphates/silicates on the quartz grain particles, with low melting temperatures and therefore sticky, resulting in bed agglomeration. For RM, this effect was mitigated by the considerable Ca and Mg concentrations, making the layers formed less sticky, despite the high K and P concentrations. For basically the same reason, the slag formation tendency of RM was moderate and comparable to many forest fuels while wheat DDGS had a slag formation tendency which was even higher than for typical wheat straw. HR had very low bed agglomeration and slagging tendencies. For RM and wheat DDGS, emissions of NO and SO 2 were generally high, for HR considerably lower. While HCl emissions for RM were low, they were relatively high for fluidized bed combustion of wheat DDGS. Particle emissions from RM and wheat DDGS were generally high. For powder combustion of RM and wheat DDGS, particle emissions were 15 - 20 times higher than for wood. The particle emissions from combustion of HR were generally low. For fluidized bed- and <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> of RM the finer particles (< 1 μm) contained mainly alkali sulfates. RM addition to bark tended to lower the particle Cl concentrations, potentially lowering the risk of high-temperature corrosion. For fluidized bed combustion of wheat DDGS and wheat DDGS-mixtures the finer particles contained mainly K and S. The Cl concentrations of the fine particles in fluidized bed combustion were reduced when wheat DDGS where added to logging residues and wheat straw in fluidized bed <b>combustion.</b> In <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> the Cl- and P-concentrations in the finer particles during combustion of the wheat DDGS-mixtures were considerable higher than during fluidized bed combustion. The fine particles from powder combustion of RM mainly contained P and K, while they mainly contained K, P, Cl, Na and S from wheat DDGS (apart from C and O). A possible use of RM is as a sulfur-containing additive to biomass fuels rich in Cl and K in large-scale fluidized-bed and grate combustors for avoiding ash-related operational problems in fluidized beds and grate combustors originated from high KCl concentrations in the flue gases. Due to its high slagging and bed agglomeration tendencies, {{the best use of}} wheat DDGS may be to mix it with other fuels, preferably with high Ca and Mg contents (e. g. woody biomass fuels), so that only a minor fraction of the total ash-forming elements is contributed by the wheat DDGS. Because of their high N- and S contents, RM and wheat DDGS require applications with flue-gas cleaning, economically viable at large-scale. Powder combustion of RM and wheat DDGS should be used with caution, as potassium phosphate particles have low melting temperatures and could therefore increase the risk of deposit formation. Use of HR in small-scale pellet appliances is an interesting option due to low emissions, low ash content and low slagging tendency. While most large-scale combustion uses of HR would be feasible, the low ash and alkali contents and stable powder combustion of HR may be better exploited in a combined-cycle process, as the alkali content can be kept sufficiently low for use in robustgas turbines, simplifying the gas cleaning. In the techno-economic assessment, residue (HR) was assumed to be combusted on site, to supply process steam and electricity to the liquid biofuel production (wood-based ethanol) with surplus residue either sold as solid fuel or used for additional heat and power generation. With a combined cycle to increase electricity production, a location with a large district heating base load is not needed. As electricity replaced is largely generated with fossil fuels, a combined cycle is significantly more effective as a climate mitigation measure than a steam-cycle only, with about 25 percent greater reduction in CO 2 emissions per litre of ethanol produced. While it is generally accepted that energy use of the residue is important to the process economy and environmental benefits of ligno-cellulosic ethanol production, it can be concluded from this study that the choice of integrated process design has a significant impact on CO 2 emissions.

Polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, kitchen waste, paper, textile, etc. were chosen to simulate the MSW. The effects of temperature, air staging, and moisture on the CO formation and emissions were analysed for both the <b>grate</b> drying bed <b>combustion</b> and the CFB <b>combustion.</b> In the <b>grate</b> drying bed, the low temperatures increased the carbon to CO conversion rate which also increased slightly with the moisture content. Industrial field tests in a commercial grate–CFB incinerator showed that the CO concentration at the grate drying bed exit was very high and decreased along furnace height. The carbon to CO conversion rates were 0 – 20 % for the grate drying bed which exceeded the range of 0. 8 – 16 % measured in a grate drying bed exit of the commercial grate–CFB incinerator tests. In the commercial grate–CFB incinerator tests, at excess air ratios ranging from 1. 5 – 2. 0 or more, the CO emissions decreased to a low and stable level, whose corresponding carbon to CO conversion rates were far lower than 0 – 10 %.

40|$|Waste <b>combustion</b> on a <b>grate</b> {{with energy}} {{recovery}} {{is an important}} pillar of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in the Netherlands. In MSW incinerators fresh waste stacked on a <b>grate</b> enters the <b>combustion</b> chamber, heats up by radiation from the flame above the layer and ignition occurs. Typically, the reaction zone starts {{at the top of}} the waste layer and propagates downwards, producing heat for drying and devolatilization of the fresh waste below it until the ignition front reaches the grate. The control of this process is mainly based on empiricism. MSW is a highly inhomogeneous fuel with continuous fluctuating moisture content, heating value and chemical composition. The resulting process fluctuations may cause process control difficulties, fouling and corrosion issues, extra maintenance, and unplanned stops. In the new concept the fuel layer is ignited by means of preheated air (T > 220 °C) from below without any external ignition source. As a result a combustion front will be formed close to the grate and will propagate upwards. That is why this approach is denoted by upward combustion. Experimental research has been carried out in a batch reactor with height of 4. 55 m, an inner diameter of 200 mm and a fuel layer height up to 1 m. Due to a high quality two-layer insulation adiabatic conditions can be assumed. The primary air can be preheated up to 350 °C, and the secondary air is distributed via nozzles above the waste layer. During the experiments, temperatures along the height of the reactor, gas composition and total weight decrease are continuously monitored. The influence of the primary air speed, fuel moisture and inert content on the combustion characteristics (ignition rate, combustion rate, ignition front speed and temperature of the reaction zone) is evaluated. The upward combustion concept decouples the drying, devolatilization and burnout phase. In this way the moisture and inert content of the waste have almost no influence on the combustion process. In this paper an experimental comparison between conventional and reversed combustion is presente...|$|R
40|$|The Cornia 2 hybrid geothermal/biomass {{power plant}} of Enel Green Power {{represents}} an innovative technology integrating renewable and geothermal energy. The plant {{is located in}} the Larderello geothermal area in Tuscany and uses biomass to superheat the geothermal steam entering the power station from a temperature of 150 - 160 to 370 - 380 Celsius degrees, thus increasing the efficiency of the geothermal cycle and the net electric power output from 12 to 16 MW.  The super-heater boiler is based on reciprocating grate technology and is fed with two kinds of biomass: local virgin biomass wood-chips and low-quality agricultural residues. A numerical model of the biomass combustion on the moving grate is developed through the coupling of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Discrete Element Method (DEM). In particular the eXtended Discrete Element Method (XDEM) [1] is employed to describe the granular behaviour of the two kinds of biomass particles. The peculiar feature of XDEM is that it encompasses chemical and thermodynamic particle properties (temperature profile, species distribution, porosity, diffusivity, etc.) in addition to kinematic (position, velocity and orientation) ones, thus allowing taking into account evaporation, pyrolysis and char oxidation. The CFD model is handled with OpenFOAM®-Extend and solves mass, momentum, species transport end energy equations in the gaseous phase. Hence, the CFD solution provides boundary conditions to the particles within the XDEM treatment whereas particles constitute sources/sinks of mass, momentum, chemical species and energy in the gas phase CFD equations. The results highlight the unsteady behaviour of the biomass <b>combustion</b> on the <b>grate,</b> showing the presence of gas streaks coming out from the bed. The approach is very useful as it provides a full characterisation of both gaseous and particle phases without the need of any a priori hypothesis on the biomass conversion.

The aim {{of this research was}} to develop and evaluate methods for in-situ characterisation of fine and ultrafine particles and to determine their deposition in the human airways. The aim was also to increase knowledge about health and environmentally relevant properties of aerosols from biomass combustion and selected indoor sources. The methods include instrumental techniques such as Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), Electrical Low-Pressure Impactor (ELPI), Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) and Tandem Differential Mobility Analysers (TDMA) based on volatility and hygroscopic growth. Filter samplers and impactors were used for collecting particles on substrates for subsequent chemical analysis. Emissions from local district heating plants (0. 5 - 12 MW), based on moving <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> of woody fuels, were sampled with a dilution system and characterised. Particles from the indoor sources of cigarettes, incense and candles were examined in the laboratory by using an airtight 22 m 3 stainless steel chamber. A set-up to determine respiratory deposition in humans was constructed. It was automatised and uses an electrical mobility spectrometer with an improved inversion algorithm to perform fast measurements of particles of different sizes in the inhaled and exhaled air. It was evaluated on human test-persons. The investigated biomass combustion sources emit high concentrations of fine and ultrafine particles. The chemical composition is dominated by KCl and K 2 SO 4; Zn, Cd and Pb were also quantified. Elemental carbon was identified in particles larger than 150 nm during periods of incomplete combustion. The particle concentration depends on the fuel ash content and the combustion efficiency. The aerosol is essentially internally mixed with hygroscopic growth factors significantly higher than reported for diesel exhaust and environmental tobacco smoke. The particles restructure from agglomerates to a more compact shape upon first exposure to moderately high relative humidity. This results in an increase in effective density and fractal dimension. Hygroscopic growth of these particles reduces the respiratory dose by a factor of 3 - 4 compared to hydrophobic particles of the same size. The biomass combustion particles mainly consist of soluble ash components and need to be treated differently in future health effect assessments compared to particles from incomplete combustion, e. g. from diesel engines, wood stoves and cigarette smoke. Sidestream cigarette and incense smoke are well internally mixed aerosols dominated by organic compounds. Each particle consists of components with a relatively wide range in vapour pressure. The volatile fraction decreases at lower particle concentrations in the chamber and upon ageing, which is attributed to different degrees of evaporation from the particle to the gas phase. Four different particle types were identified in emissions from candles. The feasibility of the ELPI and the APS to assess mass size distributions was investigated. It was found that the measurement quality is dependent on the size distribution of the aerosol. The set-up for respiratory deposition has low inherent particle losses. Determinations of precision, accuracy and sensitivity show that it can be used for field measurements in typical urban and indoor environments. Methods for characterisation of aerosols containing fine and ultrafine particles have been developed, evaluated and applied. The results can be used to improve exposure assessments in toxicological and epidemiological studies and for risk assessments. Papers included in the thesis I.

30|$|Tea {{industry}} in Sri Lanka is significant. Ceylon Tea is popular {{all over the}} world for its quality since {{for a long time and}} Sri Lanka is third largest Tea exporter in the world. In 2013, Tea export has earned about 2  billion US$, which is approximately 14  % of total exports in the country and it is 62  % of total agriculture exports (Sri Lanka Export Development Board 2015). Major contemporary barrier facing in the Tea industry is high energy intensity due to using of inefficient obsolete biomass combustion technologies. In conventional biomass operated systems, 2.4  kg of fuel wood is required to produce 1  kg of “made” tea (Leelaratne 2003) and ninety percent (90  %) of energy requirement is thermal energy and out of that eighty five percent (85  %) comes from biomass which is utilized for drying and withering. Presently various approaches have been implemented to reduce energy consumption for minimizing cost of tea production. Wood log combustors are commonly used in present Tea industries. Then retrofitted wood log combustors by continuous wood chip feeding systems to use wood chips is identified as most viable method to improve the combustion efficiency of existing systems. As wood chips feed from one side of the combustor, it can be considered as a moving packed bed combustion. Then, biomass feeding rate affects to packed bed moving velocity. To understand performance of these systems, it is vital to study thermal fluid flow patterns inside the combustor, which affects to heat transfer to hot air circulations, for temperature controlling of hot air in the tea drying purpose (Rajika and Narayana 2013). In this study, a steady state two-dimensional CFD model was developed for wood chip <b>combustion</b> with moving <b>grate</b> system and a simulation study was accomplished. The CFD model was validated with data from a wood chip combustor, which is used in a Tea factory in Sri Lanka. The CFD model represents the temperature distribution in the packed bed combustor. Although this research focused on a particular combustor, the packed bed combustion model is a generalized model. The whole modelling approach can be used to simulate steady state combustion process. Reactions and thermo-physical properties were evaluated by using existing empirical models, which suits for biomass combustion.|$|R
40|$|Woody biomass <b>combustion</b> {{in moving}} <b>grate</b> {{furnaces}} occurs in two distinct regions: the solid bed {{region and the}} freeboard region above the fuel layer. This thesis reports about the work related {{to the development of}} a model to simulate the biomass bed combustion. The developed model is a 1 -D transient model and it has been applied to study a multidimensional process such as the biomass thermal conversion in moving grate furnaces. This is possible since the physical variable gradients in the direction of the bed height are much higher than those in the direction of the bed length, thus, thermal and mass exchanges in the grate direction can be neglected. Considering these observations, the study of the combustion process in moving grate furnaces can be reduced to the observation of a vertical column of fuel that is moving along the grate inside the furnace and a 1 -D transient system can be used to model the thermal conversion of the biomass fuel inside the combustion chamber. Biomass combustion modeling is central to defining the right strategies for controlling and optimizing the combustion process. Indeed, the quality of the biomass fuels in terms of physical and chemical properties can vary significantly. Thus, it is readily apparent that a detailed understanding on what happens when biomass is burned and, in particular, what changes occur when the fuel characteristics and the operational conditions vary, enables us to make the correct decisions with respect to the optimal design and operational principles of the biomass combustion applications. The process of biomass combustion involves a series of physical and chemical phenomena strictly coupled with each other and, irrespective of the complexity of the combustion technology and fuel characteristics, they can be divided in: initial heating, moisture evaporation, devolatilization of volatile matter ad char formation, heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions and bed shrinkage. While these phenomena proceed, the gases flowing through the packed bed and the biomass particles exchange heat and mass between each other. Under a mathematical point of view the simulation model is a 1 -D system of partial differential equations (PDE’s). To solve this system, the calculation domain and the PDE’s have been discretized to obtain an algebraic system of equations. The calculation domain was divided into a number of non-overlapping control volumes which surround each grid point. In the meshed geometry, obtained with this procedure, all the variables are defined at the grid points. To discretize the diffusion term of the equations a piecewise linear profile for the variables was assumed, whereas for the convective term the upwind scheme was adopted. In this scheme, the internal conditions of the cell in term of concentration, temperature, velocity and density define the output of the calculation node. Once the system has been discretized, the Modified Newton Method was applied to minimize the equation residuals and find the solution vector. To come to the formulation of the simulation program an accurate literature review on biomass combustion modeling and experiments has been done. This part represents a complete outline on the state of the art on biomass combustion modeling and experiments and enabled us to make the right decisions regarding which mathematical formulations to adopt for the simulation of the different phenomena. The last part of the model development was its validation against experimental results. The comparison between the simulation outcomes and the experimental measurements showed good prediction capability of the developed program and allowed its utilization with the aim to study biomass bed <b>combustion</b> on moving <b>grates</b> furnaces. With this purpose a series of six simulations were performed and their results were presented and discussed. The simulations took into account the same kind of woody biomass with two different amounts of moisture and under different operational conditions in terms of inlet air flow rate and temperature. The results have shown that a higher moisture content increases the combustion time since it reduces the bed temperature and slows down the combustion reaction rate; moreover, a reduction of the inlet air flow rate reduces the combustion time in case of reaction limited regime because of the reduction of the cooling effect of the gases that pass through the bed. Finally, the utilization of pre-heated air reduces the duration of the combustion process because the biomass bed at the reaction front is already drier and warmer. This ensures a higher combustion rate. To conclude it has to be considered that, the outcomes of the developed model, in terms of gas temperature, composition and flow rate, are structured to be used as inlet data for a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of the gaseous phase combustion in the chamber above the solid bed, in order to have a comprehensive understanding of the biomass combustion dynamics...|$|R
40|$|This work {{concerns}} log firing in small-scale boilers for house heating, {{which in}} Sweden meets a heat demand of 12 TWh a year. In boilers used for domestic central heating in {{the sizes of}} 10 to 30 kW the predominant <b>combustion</b> technique is <b>grate</b> firing. Prediction of the transient release of combustible gas from the log-fire in such boilers enables an optimised design of the combustion chamber to minimise emissions of unburnt and harmful emissions. The release of gas is governed by the heating of each log of wood. The heat flux to a log is given by {{the design of the}} furnace and by the surrounding logs. Exposure of a log to a heat flux will lead to evaporation of water (drying) and then to thermal degradation (pyrolysis) of the wood into volatiles (about 80 %) and char (about 20 %). Subsequently these constituents will burn. In order to predict the release of gas from a log of wood under combustion conditions, drying and pyrolysis of one log of wood, idealised to a cylinder, are studied. The complex heating situation in a log-fire in a small-scale boiler is simplified to a constant furnace wall temperature. The progress of drying and pyrolysis was monitored from measurements of interior temperature distribution and mass loss. The heat transfer properties of wood and charcoal were investigated. Based on comparison of measured data and simulations, using a numerical model, the applicability of measured thermal properties, the submodel of pyrolysis and the anisotropy of wood permeability are discussed. The results suggest that modelling of drying and pyrolysis of thermally thick wood particles should include: The structural changes during pyrolysis causing growth of pores, formation of cracks and global shrinkage of the sample. A pyrolysis reaction mechanism that accurately predicts initiation of pyrolysis at slow heating rates, such as in the particle's interior. Drying governed by the liquid permeability in the longitudinal fibre direction at moisture contents above the fibre saturation point. Instant, non-thermal equilibrium release of gas from the particle at temperatures above 400 °C (after pyrolysis). Due to the structural changes in conjunction with uncertainties in literature on thermal properties of wood and charcoal, it is recommended to use a simple approach, for instance, of constant thermal diffusivity. The application of {{the results of this study}} to other types of thermally thick wood particles needs data on thermal properties of wood and charcoal coupled to the structural variations in such particles...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{problems}} in small district heating systems is the large load variation that must be handled by the system. If the boiler is designed to cover the needs during the coldest day in winter time in northern Europe it would have to run at loads as low as 10 % of full load during summer time, when heat is needed only for tap water production. Load variations in small networks are quite fast and earlier investigations have shown that existing biomass boilers give rise to large amounts of harmful emissions at fast load variations and at low loads. The problem has been addressed in different ways: Three new boiler concepts have been realized and tested: A prototype of a 500 kW boiler with partitioned primary combustion chamber and supplied with a water heat store. A 10 kW bench scale combustor and a 500 kW prototype boiler based on pulsating combustion. Bench scale boilers to test the influence from applied sound on emissions and a 150 kW prototype boiler with a two-stage secondary vortex combustion chamber. Development of control and regulating equipment: Glow Guard, a control system using infra-red sensors to detect glowing char on the grate, has been constructed and tested. A fast prediction model {{that can be used in}} control systems has been developed. Simulation of the combustion process: Code to simulate pyrolysis/gasification of fuel on the grate has been developed. Combustion of the gas phase inside the combustion chamber has been simulated. The two models have been combined to describe the combustion process inside the primary chamber of a prototype boiler. A fast simulation code based on statistical methods that can predict the environmental performance of boilers has been developed. One of the boiler concepts matches the desired load span from 10 to 100 % of full load with emissions far below the set limits for CO and THC and close to the set limits for NO{sub x}. The other boilers had a bit more narrow load range, one with very low emissions except for NO{sub x} and the other with emissions close to the set limits. The Glow Guard worked as desired and will be a useful tool for control of <b>combustion</b> on the <b>grate.</b> The simulation of the processes inside the combustion chamber matches the experimental results well in terms of velocity and temperature.

40|$|Abstract Combustion {{of biomass}} in {{small-scale}} furnaces {{is widely used}} in many countries and in different applications. Often, the technology used is fixed <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> in small batch furnaces. The efficiency of such furnace is often low which results in a high environmental impact due to the poorly controlled combustion of the wood logs that are largely used as the heat source for baking bread in wood-fired bakery ovens. This work has been undertaken {{in order to develop}} an efficient and environment friendly bakery oven furnace fired by biomass. The work was performed in Mozambique, and a survey was used to evaluate the consumption of wood and the technology used in the process of bread baking in two selected townships. The data collected from the 104 bakeries consisted of the dimensions of the oven, the temperature profiles within the combustion chamber and baking oven and, finally, the baking time. The circulation of hot gases within the baking oven was used to describe and predict the behaviour of the heat exchange {{and the quality of the}} products produced. Bi-dimensional cold flow equipment and a CFD model were used in conjunction to estimate the flow pattern inside the oven, which is one of the key factors in determining the baking efficiency of such ovens. Experiments were conducted in a physical model; various velocities were used to simulate changes in the air flow within the combustion chamber of the bakery ovens. Mathematical modelling was used to describe the flow using a standard k-ω model, which took the effects of the feeding door into account. As much as 60 tons/day of green wood are consumed in the bread baking process in the investigated area. The bread baking process in a semi-direct bakery oven occurs when contact is made between the bread/dough and the flue gases as they exit the combustion chamber. The relationship between the mass of firewood consumed and mass of wheat processed (specific consumption) was found to be 0. 55 in indirect ovens and 0. 90 in semi-direct. The temperature profile in a semi-direct oven beyond the inlet airflow is affected negatively by the feeding door, an effect that is magnified with manual feeding of the dough causing lack of uniformity on the quality of the bread produced. Surrounding air rushes in via the bottom edge of the feeding door when it is opened, whilst hot gases exit rapidly, flowing oven the top edge of the door, and thus affects the overall heat transfer by changing the effective thermal conductivity. Urgent improvement to this system is recommended not only to minimize this phenomenon but also to improve the efficiency of such ovens and the quality of the bread produced therein. Comparisons made between the flow pattern achieved by the bi-dimensional cold flow model and the CFD model show acceptable agreement. The flow pattern inside the baking oven varies with variations in the hot gases leaving the combustion chamber. The increment in velocity directly improves the baking conditions in the temperature range desired by increasing the circulation and effective thermal conductivity of the hot gases within the baking oven...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{removal of}} tar from the raw gas {{produced}} during biomass gasification is necessary before the gas {{can be used}} as a feedstock for synthetic fuels. The currently commercially available technologies for gas cleaning, i. e., scrubber systems, have various disadvantages, such as heat penalties and loss of the energy that is chemically stored within the tars. In addressing these problems in this work, a novel method for secondary tar cleaning is proposed and experimentally validated. This method combines tar cleaning with catalyst regeneration in a system of dual fluidized beds, which is experimentally explored in two reactors systems of identical size: a cold Perspex unit; and a high-temperature steel unit. Fluid dynamics and operation controllability were evaluated in the cold system; the results indicate that solid circulation is controllable and that adequate gas tightness of the loop-seals can be achieved. The knowledge gained from operating the cold system was subsequently used to demonstrate the tar-cleaning method in the hot reactor system. This was done using the raw gas from the Chalmers biomass gasifier, which contained 20 – 30 gtar/Nm 3 tar. The tar-reforming activity, catalyst regeneration, and potential for catalytically adjusting the raw gas were investigated. The results of these experiments indicate that almost all tars can be reformed using a catalyst that consists of nickel oxide supported on an α-Al 2 O 3 matrix (NiO/Al 2 O 3). Promising tar-reforming properties were also observed when the naturally occurring ore ilmenite (FeTiO 3, in its most reduced form) was used; in this set-up, approximately 60 % of the tar fraction was reduced. A clear trend towards enhanced hydrogen production was seen in the reactor system, and this was enhanced with increases in the operating temperature. The accumulation of coke on the catalyst was minimized, as the transported carbon was continuously oxidized to CO 2 in the regenerator, even though as much as 30 gtar/Nm 3 gas were feed into the reformer reactor. Deactivation of the catalysts was not detected during the experiments. A method for the online determination of the moisture content of gas, which was originally developed for measuring the moisture content of the raw gas from a gasifier, was experimentally evaluated using flue gases from biomass <b>combustion</b> in a <b>grate</b> furnace and in a CFB boiler. In the CFB experiments, the moisture-measuring unit was operated in series with an FT-IR cell, to enable comparison with a well-established technique. The proposed method gave highly accurate measurements and a response time that was in seconds, in the absence of significant hysteresis. Possibilities to increase the oxygen distribution and even out both the temperature and the profile of unburned species in a CFB furnace were investigated by the incorporation of a metal oxide (ilmenite) into the bed material. The investigation was conducted in the Chalmers 12 -MWth boiler/gasifier system, and up to 40 wt. % of the ordinary used silica-sand bed material was replaced with ilmenite. Experiments, which initially involved the boiler only and that subsequently also included the gasifier, showed that the amount of unburned spices was lowered when ilmenite was mixed in with the bed material. In addition, the study revealed that more of the combustion reactions were allocated to the furnace when ilmenite was used, in comparison with using silica-sand only, in which case part of the combustion occurred in the cyclone. Given the similarities in process layout between the boiler/gasifier system and the proposed tar-cleaning reactor system, operation with metal oxides in boiler/gasifier system can provide important information related to the scale-up of the tar-cleaning method...|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis describes the fundamentals ofmathematical modeling for the industrial furnaces and boilersand {{presents the results}} from the numerical simulations of sometypical applications in advanced industrial furnaces andboilers. The main objective of this thesis work is to employcomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology as an effectivecomputer simulation tool to study and develop the newcombustion concepts, phenomena and processes in advancedindustrial furnaces and boilers. The applications concern onfrom retrofitted conventional grate boilers to the mostadvanced highly preheated and diluted air combustion (HPDAC) furnaces. In this work, several topics are specially concernedwhen applying CFD technology to combustion cases. These topicsare including grate bed model, NOxmodeling, mixing problem, air staging system, andhighly preheated and diluted air combustion technology. In thiswork, a black-box grate bed model is developed and used inmodeling of grate fired furnaces and boilers. It is based onthe thermodynamic calculations and a set of conservationequations of mass, energy of fuel and air on the grate bed. Oneof benefits of this bed model is simple and feasible to be putinto use in industry. For NOxmodeling, besides the thermal NO and prompt NO,the HCN route fuel NO has been employed to predict the fuel NOemissions in coal/biomass fired furnaces. In addition, based onNH 3 route of fuel NO formation, a SNCR scheme for NOxabatement has been proposed also. For mixingproblem, the concepts of global degree of mixing and individualdegree of mixing have been proposed and used successfully inpractical applications. The new definition of degree of mixingovercomes some shortages of existed mixing parameters, such asthe mixing factor and the degree of non-mixing, which arenon-normalized and may lose physical meaning in some regions ofthe system. A new air staging system has been studied. It isused to improve the secondary or over-fire air configuration,thus to reduce the pollutant emissions and to enhance thecombustion facilities' efficiencies. In this work, the airstaging system has been employed in coal and biomass combustionfor grate fired furnaces/boilers. The performance of the newair staging system has been evaluated and optimized by usingnumerical modeling method together with physical modelingmethod. Results show that the new air staging system has a goodpotential of improving the combustion quality and reducing thepollutant emissions in industrial furnaces and boilers. Recently, the highly preheated and diluted air combustiontechnology has been regarded as the new generation energytechnology for advanced industrial furnaces and boilers. Inthis work, the highly preheated and diluted air combustionphenomena have been studied by using different numericalmodels. A hybrid procedure of both the large eddy simulationusing subgrid-scale stress Smagorinsky model and the Reynoldsstress model with eddy dissipation model has been alsoinvestigated to study the dynamic combustion process under theconditions of highly preheated and diluted air combustion. Results show that HPDAC technology possesses advantages ofsaving energy and low NOxemission, thus it has high potential to be usedfor the next generation of industrial furnaces and boilers. Thelarge eddy simulation using subgrid-scale stress Smagorinskymodel together with Reynolds stress model / eddy dissipationmodel are possible to study the HPDAC dynamic process. Finally,this work shows that numerical modeling method is a verypromising tool to deal with the complicated combustionprocesses even for practical applications in industry.
