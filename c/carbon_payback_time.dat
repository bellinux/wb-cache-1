40|$|Increasing the {{digestibility}} {{of cattle}} rations by feeding grains and whole plant silages from maize {{have been identified}} as effective options to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The effect of ploughing grassland for maize crops have not been taken into account yet. A intensive dairy farm is used as an example to demonstrate the trade offs by this type of land use change when more maize silage is fed to dairy cows. The model DAIRY WISE has been used to calculate the mitigation by the changed ration, the Introductory Carbon Balance Model to calculate the changes in soil organic carbon and nitrogen caused by ploughing grassland for maize crops. The losses of soil carbon and the loss of sequestration potential are much larger than the annual mitigation by feeding more maize. The ecosystem <b>carbon</b> <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> defines the years of mitigation that are needed before the emissions due to land use change are compensated. For ploughing grassland on sandy soils, the <b>carbon</b> <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> is 60 years. A higher global warming potential for methane can reduce the <b>carbon</b> <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> with 30 %. Ploughing clay soils with a higher equilibrium level of soil organic matter increases the payback time by maximally 70 %. The payback times occur only in the case of permanent maize cropping, grass maize rotations cause annual losses of nitrous oxide that are larger than the mitigation by feeding more maize...|$|E

40|$|Much of the {{existing}} UK housing stock has a poor standard of energy performance and the residential sector currently accounts for around 25 % of the country’s carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. The eco-refurbishment of dwellings is a key action if the UK is to meet national targets for reducing carbon emissions, mitigating global warming and alleviating fuel poverty. Older properties {{tend to be the}} hardest to heat and the most difficult to refurbish, and this is particularly true for the UK’s five to six million terraced homes, many of which not only date back to the 19 th century, but they represent early examples of mass urban living, hence they have strong cultural and architectural resonances. It is a significant challenge to the building industry, therefore, to sustainably renovate these buildings whilst maintaining their aesthetic character. This research analysed large amounts of monitoring data provided by the government’s ‘Retrofit for the Future’ programme for a 19 th century, solid wall end-terraced house in Liverpool, England, in order to determine how the key features of the retrofit design would contribute to the improved energy performances of the refurbished houses. The aim of this renovation was to go beyond current UK thermal building regulations and to achieve the more exacting German Passivhaus standard. Analysing two years of extensive monitoring data revealed that the retrofitted house used 60 % less energy and produced 76 % fewer CO 2 emissions than the estimated figures for a pre-refurbished house. Solar thermal panels provided over 61 % of the hot water required in two year of occupancy. During the first year of occupancy the highest indoor air temperature was 26. 5 °C and indoor CO 2 levels exceeded 1000 PPM for 340 hours, or 11 % of the occupied time. Using probabilistic UK future weather data and the dynamic thermal modelling software, DesignBuilder, the thermal performance of the house was simulated under different climate change probabilities with results indicating that the need to minimise over-heating, together with maintaining acceptable internal temperatures, will become increasingly important factors in retrofit design decision making. Finally, long term energy cost savings and carbon payback times for this case study were evaluated. The results of these calculations showed that the most favourable energy bill savings occurred when gas prices were rising – this gave a payback time of less than forty-three years. A <b>carbon</b> <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> of less than eight years means that {{there was no need for}} climate change sensitivity analysis of the model and the measures in the <b>carbon</b> <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> study. In addition, the Cost per Tonne of Carbon Saved (CTS) calculation showed that fabric measures, especially external wall insulation, are the most cost and carbon effective measures in the eco-retrofitted Liverpool terraced house...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to identify the energy balance of Indonesian palm oil biodiesel production, including the stages of land use change, transport and milling and biodiesel processing, and to estimate the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from different production systems, including large and small holder plantations either dependent or independent, located in Kalimantan and in Sumatra. Results show that the accompanied implications of palm oil biodiesel produced in Kalimantan and Sumatra are different: energy input in Sumatra is higher than in Kalimantan, except for transport processes; the input/output ratios are positive in both regions and all production systems. The findings demonstrate that there are considerable differences between the farming systems and the locations in net energy yields (43. 6 to 49. 2 GJ t- 1 biodiesel yr- 1) as well as greenhouse gas emissions (1969. 6 to 5626. 4 kg CO 2 eq t- 1 biodiesel yr- 1). The output to input ratios are positive in all cases. The largest greenhouse gas emissions result from land use change effects, followed by the transesterification, fertilizer production, agricultural production processes, milling and transportation.

40|$|AbstractThe future {{bioenergy}} crop potential {{depends on}} (1) {{changes in the}} food system (food demand, agricultural technology), (2) political stability and investment security, (3) biodiversity conservation, (4) avoidance of long <b>carbon</b> <b>payback</b> <b>times</b> from deforestation, and (5) energy crop yields. Using a biophysical biomass-balance model, we analyze how these factors affect global primary bioenergy potentials in 2050. The model calculates biomass supply and demand balances for eleven world regions, eleven food categories, seven food crop types and two livestock categories, integrating agricultural forecasts and scenarios with a consistent global land use and NPP database. The TREND scenario results in a global primary bioenergy potential of 77 EJ/yr, alternative assumptions on food-system changes result {{in a range of}} 26 – 141 EJ/yr. Exclusion of areas for biodiversity conservation and inaccessible land in failed states reduces the bioenergy potential by up to 45 %. Optimistic assumptions on future energy crop yields increase the potential by up to 48 %, while pessimistic assumptions lower the potential by 26 %. We conclude that the design of sustainable bioenergy crop production policies needs to resolve difficult trade-offs such as food vs. energy supply, renewable energy vs. biodiversity conservation or yield growth vs. reduction of environmental problems of intensive agriculture...|$|R

The joint {{production}} of these crops enhances {{the sustainability of}} ethanol. The objective of this work was comparing a traditional sugarcane ethanol production system (TSES) with a joint production system (JSEB), in which ethanol and biodiesel are produced at the same biorefinery but only ethanol is traded. The comparison is based on ISO 14. 040 : 2006 and ISO 14044 : 2006, and appropriate indicators. Production systems in Cerrado (typical savannah), Cerradao (woody savannah) and pastureland ecosystems were considered. Energy and carbon balances, and land use change impacts were evaluated. The joint system includes 100 % substitution of biodiesel for diesel, which is all consumed in different cropping stages. Data were collected by direct field observation methods, and questionnaires applied to Brazilian facilities. Three sugarcane mills situated in Sao Paulo State and one palm oil refinery located in Para State were surveyed. The information was supplemented by secondary sources. Results demonstrated that fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions decreased, whereas energy efficiency increased when JSEB was compared to TSES. In comparison with TSES, the energy balance of JSEB was 1. 7 greater. In addition, JSEB released 23 % fewer GHG emissions than TSES.

40|$|As {{an energy}} saving measure, {{part of an}} {{integrated}} response to mitigate climate change, the New Zealand Government raised the legal minimum requirements for the thermal performance of new homes. A carbon footprint provides a means to quantify the effect this action has had to reduce the impact our new homes have on the environment. To date however, no study has been conducted to ascertain the carbon footprint of this change. This industry research project addresses this issue by determining the carbon footprint {{of the increase in}} home insulation levels in New Zealand. An investigation was made to quantify the additional embodied energy required to meet the new standard, and the resulting savings in electrical home space heating energy use. A scientific test and control method was employed. A standard timber framed three bedroom house design complying with the new thermal insulation standard was tested against the same design complying with the old standard over an operational life of 50 years. The test was conducted in New Zealand’s three climate zones {{with the aid of a}} computer thermal simulation programme. It was found that double glazed windows make up the bulk of the additional embodied energy and carbon. The benefits of the increase in thermal insulation increased with the colder climate zones which produced the smaller carbon footprint. The heating schedule employed within the home proved to be the most influential factor to both the carbon footprint size and the rate of environmental/carbon payback. It was also found that while current fluctuations in emissions from electricity generation, or even a potential increase in emissions from non-renewable energy sources had little effect on the rate of carbon payback, electricity from all renewable, clean energy sources lengthened <b>carbon</b> <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> six fold. The study showed that carbon payback for the increase in embodied energy could not be reached through heat energy savings within the 50 year operational life of the building if a typical low heating schedule was used powered through electricity generated by all renewable energy sources...|$|E
40|$|While {{buildings}} are often credited as accounting for some 40 % {{of the global}} greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the construction phase is typically assumed to account for only around one tenth of the overall emissions. However, {{the relative importance of}} construction phase emissions is quickly increasing as the energy efficiency of buildings increases. In addition, the significance of construction may actually be much higher when the temporal perspective of the emissions is taken into account. The construction phase carbon spike, i. e. high GHG emissions in a short time associated with the beginning of the building's life cycle, may be high enough to question whether new construction, no matter how energy efficient the {{buildings are}}, can contribute to reaching the greenhouse gas mitigation goals of the near future. Furthermore, the construction of energy efficient buildings causes more GHG emissions than the construction of conventional buildings. On the other hand, renovating the current building stock together with making energy efficiency improvements might lead to a smaller construction phase carbon spike and still to the same reduced energy consumption in the use phase as the new energy efficient buildings. The study uses a new residential development project in Northern Europe to assess the overall life cycle GHG emissions of a new residential area and to evaluate the influence of including the temporal allocation of the life cycle GHG emissions in the assessment. In the study, buildings with different energy efficiency levels are compared with a similar hypothetical area of buildings of the average existing building stock, as well as with a renovation of an area with average buildings from the 1960 s. The GHG emissions are modeled with a hybrid life cycle assessment. The study suggests that the <b>carbon</b> <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> of constructing new residential areas is several decades long even when using very energy efficient buildings compared to utilizing the current building stock. Thus, while increasing the overall energyefficiency is important in the long term, the construction of new energy efficient buildings cannot be used as a means to achieve the short term and medium term climate change mitigation goals as cities and governments often suggest. Furthermore, given the magnitude of the carbon spike from construction and its implications, the climate change mitigation strategies should set reduction targets for the construction phase emissions alongside the ones for the use phase, which currently receives almost all of the attention from policy-makers.

40|$|Nowadays, in the European Union the {{construction}} rate of new buildings {{is very low}} and therefore achieving the EU targets at the energy consumption level of the building sector is only possible through nearly zero energy renovation of the existing building stock. Reducing energy consumption through passive measures is a priority {{but this is not}} enough to achieve the nearly Zero Energy Building (nZEB) level. Therefore, the active systems, namely those that allow harvesting the solar energy to partially replace the use of non-renewable energy, are one of the best solutions to consider. At this level, solar thermal and photovoltaic panels play an important role, mainly in countries with high levels of solar radiation, as in the Southern European countries. Nevertheless, there are still some barriers to overcome for the broader dissemination of the implementation of these systems. One of the most important is that building owners are not fully aware of the life-cycle benefits that systems have at the economic level. As in every new different design approach, the best way to arise awareness is through the analysis of case studies, highlighting the reduced life-cycle costs and potential environmental impacts and other long-term benefits resulting from the integration of these active solutions. Thus, this paper is aimed at assessing the contribution of the solar systems to achieve three levels of energy performance (Basic Renovation, nearly Zero Energy Buildings - nZEB and Zero Energy Buildings - ZEB) in the energy renovation of a multifamily building located in Portugal. From the results, it is possible to conclude that, on an annual basis, and for the Portuguese climate, it is possible to overcome, a large amount of the energy needs for acclimatization and domestic hot water preparation with the integration of these systems.

40|$|Recovering {{heat from}} waste water {{discharged}} from showers to preheat the incoming cold {{water has been}} promoted as a cost effective, energy efficient and low carbon design option which has {{been included in the}} UK’s Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) for demonstrating compliance with the Building Regulation for dwellings. Incentivized by its carbon-cost effectiveness, waste water heat exchangers (WWHX) have been selected and incorporated in a newly constructed Sports Pavilion at the University of Brighton in the UK. This £ 2 m sports development serving several football fields was completed in August 2015 providing eight water and energy efficient shower rooms for students, staff and external organizations. Six of the shower rooms are located on the ground floor and two on the first floor, each fitted with 5 or 6 thermostatically controlled shower units. Inline type of WWHX were installed, each consisted of a copper pipe section wound by an external coil of smaller copper pipe through which the cold water would be warmed before entering the shower mixers. Using the installation at Sport Pavilion as the case study, this research aims to evaluate the environmental and financial sustainability of a vertical waste heat recovery device, over a life cycle of 50 years, with comparison to the normal use of a PVC-u pipe. A heat transfer mathematical model representing the system has been developed to inform the development of the methodology for measuring the in-situ thermal performance of individual and multiple use of showers in each changing room. Adopting a system thinking modelling technique, a quasi-dynamic simulation computer model was established enabling the prediction of annual energy consumptions under different shower usage profiles. Data based on the process map and inventory of a functional unit of WWHX were applied to a proprietary assessment software to establish the relevant outputs for the life cycle environmental impact assessment. Life cycle cost models were developed and industry price book data were applied. The results indicated that the seasonal thermal effectiveness was over 50 % enabling significant energy savings through heat recovery that led to short <b>carbon</b> <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> of less than two years to compensate for the additional greenhouse gas emissions associated with the WWHX. However, the life cycle cost of the WWHX is much higher than using the PVC pipe, even with significant heat recovered under heavy usage, highlighting the need to adopt more economic configurations, such as combining waste water through fewer units, in order to maximize the return on investment and improve the financial viability...|$|E
40|$|Seed-oil based {{biodiesel}} production particularly biodiesel {{production from}} the nonedible oil seed bearing plant - Jatropha curcas L. - {{is a key}} strategic direction outlined in the biofuels strategy of the Government of Ethiopia. The main objective underlying the strategy include substitution of imported diesel oil used in the road transport sector {{while at the same}} time contributing to the local and global greenhouse gasses (GHG) reduction efforts. In this study the environmental benefits and costs of production and use of Jatropha biodiesel in the road transport sector of Ethiopia is assessed using a life cycle analysis (LCA) methodology. The analysis focused on determining the potential environmental impacts and net non-renewable energy saving potential of biodiesel from Jatropha oil-seeds using the following metrics: (i) Net Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction, and (ii) Net Energy Balance (NEB) relative to diesel oil. The study shows that the net GHG emissions reduction potential of Jatropha Methyl Ester (JME) is highly influenced by the magnitude of initial carbon loss occurring in the process of conversion of different land uses to Jatropha plantation, and less so on other unit processes of JME production system analysed. The NEB of JME relative to use of diesel oil per functional unit of one GJ is less sensitive to impacts of land use change and is generally positive. Where no land use change impacts is considered, or where Jatropha is grown on lands with low carbon stock such as grasslands, substitution of diesel oil with JME in Ethiopia can provide GHG emission reduction of about 43 %, and for each MJ of JME produced the nonrenewable energy requirement will be 0, 38 MJ. Production of JME by converting lands with high above ground, below ground and/or soil carbon stocks such as shrub lands or well stocked forest lands will result in net loss of carbon and require ecological <b>carbon</b> <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> of 50 to hundreds of years. The impact of introducing and use of JME-diesel oil blends by Anbassa City Bus Services Enterprise (ACBSE) bus fleets shows that, displacement of diesel oil with JME that have positive GHG reduction potential, will also contribute to the reduction of air pollutants and improvement of ambient air quality in Addis Ababa. Two key recommendations of this research work are that to ensure environmental sustainability of biodiesel production from Jatropha seeds (i) land availability and land suitability assessment for estimating the potential available land for Jatropha (and other oil-seed bearing plants) shall be conducted, and (ii) minimum requirements on GHG reduction and NEB requirements on biodiesel shall be established.

40|$|Via a {{detailed}} analysis and review of the currently available literature, this work aims at clarifying the phenomena, physical and mathematical, underpinning the methodologies and results in forest carbon accounting. The large scale techno-economic models indicate that an increased forest wood removal for bioenergy purposes may cause either a decrease of the forest carbon stock (or a lower increase compared to the BAU) or displacement of wood for products. The calculation of biogenic CO 2 correction factors or <b>carbon</b> debt <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> provides results with a large range of variability {{that depends on the}} many different characteristics and assumptions on both the bioenergy system and the reference fossil system such as: the fossil fuel replaced, efficiency of the biomass utilization, the future growth rate of the forest, the frequency and intensity of biomass harvests, forest management, the initial landscape carbon stock. However, in most cases, the bioenergy scenario causes an actual increase in CO 2 emissions compared to fossil fuels in the short-term (a decade). In the long-term eventually it may generate GHG savings and become carbon neutral (from several decades to centuries). It can be concluded also that the carbon neutrality assumption for forest bioenergy is anachronistic and may be misleading and it is fundamental to integrate all the carbon pools in the analysis (above ground biomass, below ground biomass, dead wood, litter, soil and harvested wood products) and their evolution in the time horizon of the analysis for both the bioenergy scenario and the counterfactual.

40|$|Alternative fuels {{have the}} {{potential}} to mitigate transportation's impact on the environment and enhance energy security. In this work, we investigate two alternative fuels: liquefied natural gas (LNG) as an aviation fuel, and middle distillate fuel derived from woody biomass for use in aviation or road transport. The use of LNG as a supplemental aircraft fuel is considered {{in the context of the}} Lockheed Martin C- 1 30 H and C- 130 J transport aircraft. We estimate the cost of retrofitting these aircraft to use LNG and the savings from reduced fuel expenses. We evaluate the societal impacts of LNG within a cost-benefit framework, taking into account resource consumption, human health impacts related to air quality, and climate damage. We find that aircraft operators can save up to 14 % on fuel expenses (retrofit costs included) by employing LNG retrofits, with a 95 % confidence interval of 2 - 23 %. Society can also benefit by 12 % (3 - 20 %) from LNG use as a result of improved surface air quality, lower resource consumption, and climate neutrality relative to conventional fuel. These results are highly dependent on fuel prices, the quantity and cost of the LNG retrofits, and the frequency and length of missions. Woody biomass harvested from old-growth forests produces a large carbon debt when used as a feedstock for transportation fuel. Managed forests are an attractive alternative for inexpensive biomass production with the potential to reduce this carbon debt. We study the effect of forest management practices on the <b>carbon</b> debt <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> resulting from harvesting woody biomass from managed forests for middle distillate fuel production. We also calculate the breakeven time in terms of radiative forcing, temperature change, and economic damages. We find that biofuels produced over a period of 30 years have higher CO 2 emissions than fossil fuels for 59 years, higher radiative forcing for 42 years, higher temperature change for 48 years, and higher cumulative discounted (1 - 2 %) economic damages for more than 100 years. These damages never break even at discount rates above 2 %. <b>Payback</b> <b>times</b> can be reduced by increasing the age at which biomass is harvested.

PV energy is a relevant player in global electricity market and can have a key-role in sustainable growth...|$|R

500|$|The energy <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> (EPBT) {{of a power}} {{generating}} {{system is}} {{the time required to}} generate as much energy as is consumed during production and lifetime operation of the system. Due to improving production technologies the <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> has been decreasing constantly since the introduction of PV systems in the energy market. In 2000 the energy <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> of PV systems was estimated as 8 to 11 years and in 2006 this was estimated to be 1.5 to 3.5 years for crystalline silicon [...] silicon PV systems and 1–1.5 years for thin film technologies (S. Europe). These figures fell to 0.75–3.5 years in 2013, with an average of about 2 years for crystalline silicon PV and CIS systems.|$|R

30|$|In Fig.  7 a, results {{achieved}} from the baseline scenario {{in terms of}} the annual income and the value for the hydrogen storage capacity are used as reference. It can be easily observed that the annual income increases as the capacity increases, implying a larger hydrogen storage brings in more variable income when the selling price of hydrogen is zero. However, this relatively small amount of annual income increase is not large enough to reduce the <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> down to a feasible value. Although an optimal solution found when the storage is sized as three times large of the reference value can reduce the <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> by 4.3 %, the resulted <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> is still as long as 52.4 years. In Fig. 7 b, a new reference case is selected in order to give better illustration of the sensitivity analysis. For the reference case, the hydrogen price is set as 7.5 €/kg and the resulted <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> is only 1.49 years. Comparing to the {{results achieved}} from the baseline scenario, this reduces the <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> by more than 97 %. The reason for achieving such a very optimistic value is mainly because the high efficiency and the low CAPEX of the AWE can turn hydrogen production into a profitable business. This also means {{there is no need to}} operate the FCCHP anymore, and the hydrogen storage could be considered as unnecessary if the produced hydrogen can be directly injected into the hydrogen infrastructure such as gas networks or hydrogen distribution systems. The reduced use of the FCCHP can also be observed when the hydrogen price drops. For instance, when the selling price of hydrogen is 20 % of the reference value, the total number of hours for the FCCHP working at on status is already reduced to 236, resulting in a <b>payback</b> <b>time</b> of 21.5 years.|$|R
