The solenoid valve is electrically supplied from +54 via fuse 13 and {{is controlled by}} the ECU via its pin 26 and pin 2. The control voltage is pulse width modulated (PWM) at 90 Hz below 2500 RPM and 70 Hz above 2500 RPM. The rationale for this change is to avoid resonance phenomena in the pneumatic hoses.

50|$|During engine {{operations}} the Ignition cassette continuously {{monitors the}} ion currents in the cylinders and sends {{a signal to}} the Trionic ECU, pin 44, in an event of knocking. The logic for this function rests solely in the ignition cassette and is adaptive {{to be able to handle}} disturbing fuel additives. The Trionic ECU is well aware which cylinder that has ignited and could hence cope with the information feed through one pin. The signal to pin 44 and ion current in the combustion chamber is related to each other, when this signal reaches a certain level the ECU interprets this as a knocking event and firstly lowering the ignition advance by 1,5° on this cylinder. If the knocking is repeated the ignition advance is lowered further 1,5 ° up to 12°. In case of the same lowering of the ignition timing advance in all cylinders the ECU adds a small amount of fuel to all cylinders. If knocking occurs when the MAP is over 140 kPa the knocking is regulated by switching both fuel injection matrix and ignition advance matrix. If this is not sufficient the <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> is lowered. This purpose of this procedure is to maintain good performance.

40|$|Noise {{generated}} by fluid power applications {{can be treated}} using bladder-style suppressors, and an optimal operating condition for these devices is sought in this thesis. Bladder-style suppressors employ a compliant nitrogen-charged bladder to create an impedance change within the system, reflecting the noise back to the source and preventing it from propagating downstream. The noise in a hydraulic system is created by a pump, the flow source in a hydraulic system, and can be separated into three categories: fluid-borne noise, structure-borne noise and airborne noise. Fluid-borne noise places addition stress on sealing surfaces, potentially causing leaks. Airborne noise can be uncomfortable, even hazardous depending on the level. Bladder-style suppressors primarily treat fluid-borne noise; however, it {{is seen in the}} literature that fluid-borne noise is the cause of structure-borne and airborne noise. This thesis presents an optimization method for finding the optimal <b>charge</b> <b>pressure</b> for implementation with a given system operating over a broad range of system pressures. The optimization weights suppressor performance by the spectral content of the fluid-borne noise as well as the duty cycle of the system. A single <b>charge</b> <b>pressure</b> works well over a small range of system pressures, though many fluid power applications operate over a larger range of system pressure than the usable range of a suppressor. For systems operating over an extremely broad pressure range, two suppressors <b>charged</b> to different <b>pressures</b> are used to treat the noise in the entire system pressure range. To determine suppressor performance experimental measurements were performed, and models developed, of the transmission loss of this type of device. A multi-microphone method using transfer function relationships between six sensors determines the transmission loss of the suppressor under test. An equivalent fluid model modeling the wave behavior both upstream and downstream, as well as within the suppressor, was created to predict suppressor transmission loss. Optimal configurations are found for a set of system <b>pressures,</b> <b>charge</b> <b>pressures</b> and duty cycles. Analysis of the results shows the time weighting has a more significant impact on the optimum <b>charge</b> <b>pressure</b> than the frequency weighting, as shown by duty cycles considered in this thesis. In addition, all <b>charge</b> <b>pressures</b> selected as optimal for either single suppressor optimizations or double suppressor optimizations, exhibit the highest transmission loss for a single system pressure in the pressure duty cycle for a simulated machine.

To be able to operate such an engine at relevant conditions comparable to a multi cylinder engine, it is desirable to model and control the boundary conditions, e. g. trough simulation of turbo charging. This work was done as a master thesis during the spring of 2012 at Chalmers University of Technology and the aim was to develop an online simulation of a single turbo system for a single cylinder combustion research engine.
