5|$|Geothermal power {{requires}} no fuel (except for pumps), {{and is therefore}} immune to fuel cost fluctuations. However, <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> are significant. Drilling accounts for over half the costs, and exploration of deep resources entails significant risks. A typical well doublet (extraction and injection wells) in Nevada can support 4.5 megawatts (MW) and costs about $10million to drill, with a 20% failure rate.|$|E
50|$|The {{refinery}} {{project is}} being implemented at a <b>capital</b> <b>cost</b> of Rs 270,000 million being funded through {{a mix of}} equity and debt. This represents a <b>capital</b> <b>cost</b> of less than US$10,000 per barrel per day and compares very favourably with the average <b>capital</b> <b>cost</b> of new refineries announced in recent years. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates the average <b>capital</b> <b>cost</b> of new refinery in the OECD nations {{to be in the}} region of US$15,000 to 20,000 per barrel per day. The low <b>capital</b> <b>cost</b> of RPL becomes even more attractive when adjusted for high complexity of the refinery.|$|R

5|$|In total, {{electrical}} plant {{construction and}} well drilling cost about €2–5million perMW of electrical capacity, while the break–even price is 0.04–0.10€ perkW·h. Enhanced geothermal systems {{tend to be}} on the high side of these ranges, with <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> above $4million perMW and break–even above $0.054 perkW·h in 2007. Direct heating applications can use much shallower wells with lower temperatures, so smaller systems with lower costs and risks are feasible. Residential geothermal heat pumps with a capacity of 10kilowatt (kW) are routinely installed for around $1–3,000 perkilowatt. District heating systems may benefit from economies of scale if demand is geographically dense, as in cities and greenhouses, but otherwise piping installation dominates <b>capital</b> <b>costs.</b> The capital cost of one such district heating system in Bavaria was estimated at somewhat over 1million€ perMW. Direct systems of any size are much simpler than electric generators and have lower maintenance costs perkW·h, but they must consume electricity to run pumps and compressors. Some governments subsidize geothermal projects.|$|E
5|$|The Oxford Olympics Study 2016 {{estimates}} the outturn {{cost of the}} Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics at USD 6.8 billion in 2015-dollars and cost overrun at 2% in real terms. This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) operational costs incurred by the organizing committee {{for the purpose of}} staging the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) direct <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> are not included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The Beijing Olympics' cost of USD 6.8 billion compares with costs of USD 4.6 billion for Rio 2016 and USD 15 billion for London 2012. Average cost for the Summer Games since 1960 is USD 5.2 billion.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} began purchasing church run boarding {{schools in the}} 1920s. During this period <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> associated with the schools were assumed by the government, leaving administrative and instructional duties to church officials. The hope was that minimizing facility expenditures would allow church administrators to provide higher quality instruction and support to the students in their care. Although the government was willing to, and did, purchase schools from the churches, many were acquired for free given that the rampant disrepair present in the buildings resulted in their having no economic value. Schools continued to be maintained by churches in instances where they failed {{to reach an agreement}} with government officials with the understanding that the government would provide support for <b>capital</b> <b>costs.</b> The understanding ultimately proved complicated {{due to the lack of}} written agreements outlining the extent and nature of that support or the approvals required to undertake expensive renovations and repairs.|$|E

5|$|The casting {{equipment}} and the metal dies represent large <b>capital</b> <b>costs</b> and this tends to limit the process to high-volume production. Manufacture of parts using die casting is relatively simple, involving only four main steps, which keeps the incremental cost per item low. It is especially suited for a large quantity of small- to medium-sized castings, which is why die casting produces more castings than any other casting process. Die castings are characterized by a very good surface finish (by casting standards) and dimensional consistency.|$|E
40|$|Various studies {{over the}} last decade have {{attempted}} to forecast <b>capital</b> <b>cost</b> of wind power. The main assumption underpinning these models is that cost reductions will accrue indefinitely from technological learning over time. In this paper a regression model is proposed for wind farm <b>capital</b> <b>cost</b> which is based on commodities price and water depth rather than technological learning. With greater simplicity and certainty in the theoretical foundations of such a model, it is possible to gain realistic estimates of wind turbine <b>capital</b> <b>cost.</b> Such pragmatic and well-reasoned output is needed so that wind farm developers can understand their future risk exposure to price fluctuations in <b>capital</b> <b>cost</b> of plant...|$|R

40|$|Shareholders {{expected}} return is normally impacted by informational risk and informational asymmetry, {{on the other}} hand, creates informational risk. Thus, investors demand greater risk premium {{in the case of}} informational asymmetry and in turn corporate expenditures increase. In this study, we determine the relationship between informational asymmetry and <b>capital</b> <b>cost.</b> The study uses information of 109 companies listed in Tehran Securities Exchange over the period of 2005 - 2010 and the results suggest a positive and significant relationship between informational asymmetry and <b>capital</b> <b>cost.</b> In addition, the results from present research indicate that when capital markets are competitive, there is not a significant relationship between informational asymmetry and <b>capital</b> <b>cost.</b> But when markets are partially competitive there is a significant relationship between informational asymmetry and <b>capital</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|R
