40|$|The {{technological}} process of cereals production {{used in the}} production of feed stuff, which includes the following basic steps: grain moistening; binning of moistened grain for redistribution of moisture in the bulk of kernel; steaming of moistened grain; rolling of steamed grain; drying and cooling of flakes – is developed. In the production of flakes from scoured barley and oat grain before feeding to the rolling line film removal from the grain of these crops and the separation of the husks is carried out by one the existing methods: the method of grinding, followed by sifting and eventilation of films from tail fractions or a method of peeling on special machines with a separation of films. Wet-heat treatment of grain, followed by rolling helps to improve taste and palatability of feed, improves the nutritional value of carbohydrate and protein complexes, reduces the exertion of the body to digest food nutrients, allows to inactivate antinutritional substances and free the grain from the pathogenic and other microorganisms. In the duration of rolling process splitting of complex carbohydrates occurs, starch loses its original structure and is easier exposed to enzymes. The dried and cooled flakes have satisfactory flowability, do not set up.

Aim of this pilot study was to compare weight-indexed residual gastric contents volumes (GCV(w)) after 4 vs. 6 [*]h after a light breakfast, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in healthy volunteer children not scheduled for anaesthesia. METHODS: Four vs. 6 [*]h (F(4) /F(6)) of food fasting were simulated in a crossover study. After overnight fasting (baseline), each child ingested a light breakfast (<b>cereal</b> <b>flakes,</b> milk products) on two separate days. Additional clear fluid (7 [*]ml/kg raspberry syrup) was given either after 2 (F(4)) or 4 [*]h (F(6)), followed by half-hourly MRI acquisition for 2 [*]h.

This study investigated the RS 3 formation and cereal coating properties from enzyme-modified corn starches with varying amylose contents, including Hylon VII (70 % amylose), Hylon V (50 % amylose), and common corn (25 % amylose). For RS 3 formation, corn starches were first gelatinized and then hydrolyzed using β-amylase to varying degrees. The resultant hydrolyzed starch was debranched with isoamylase and then exposed to 3 times of temperature cycling at 135 / 133 / 133 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 24 hr to promote RS 3 formation. For cereal coating applications, corn starches were gelatinized and debranched, and then sprayed onto ready-to-eat breakfast <b>cereal</b> <b>flakes.</b> The proportions of amylose and amylopectin long and short chains were affected by the β-amylase treatment and varied with starch type. All three corn starches had increased RS contents after moderate β-amylolysis with Hylon V having the highest RS content at 70. 7 % after 4 hr of β-amylolysis. The RS content {{was positively correlated with}} amylose and amylopectin long chains, but negatively correlated with amylopectin short chains. A starch film of 50 - 130 μm was observed with scanning electron microscopy {{on the surface of the}} cereals coated with Hylon VII.

This study investigated preparation of partially defatted peanut flours by extrusion, screw pressing, and use of the flours in breakfast <b>cereal</b> <b>flakes.</b> Release of oil by wet and dry extrusion was evaluated. Wet extrusion (using an Anderson International Company expander) was tried initially and abandoned in favor of dry extrusion (using an InstaPro International Company extruder). Thus, fewer samples of earlier product were observed. Dry extrusion, followed by screw pressing removed oil for a total recovery of 90. 6 % of the oil in peanut kernels. Press cakes prepared by dry extrusion had higher protein dispersibility index (PDI) than those made using wet extrusion. Trypsin inhibitor was quite stable to heat treatment, only 23 % was inactivated by dry extrusion and 26 % after screw pressing. Press cakes were roasted (166 'C for 8 min) to develop flavor. Press cakes were ground and evaluated as protein supplement in flakes. Corn cones, ground corn of particle size intermediate between meal and flour, were replaced with unroasted partially defatted peanut flour (PDPF) and roasted flour (R-PDPF) at 0 %, 10 %, 20 % and 30 % levels. The mixtures were extruded using a Wenger Manufacturing Company twin-screw extruder to produce collets. The collets were flaked, then roasted at 171 'C for 3 min. Flakes containing 30 % PDPF had 16 % protein. Increasing the peanut flour level decreased the product bulk density and hardness. Lightness and yellowness decreased as the peanut flour content increased. Water absorption (WAI) and water solubility (WSI) indices increased for flakes with addition of peanut flour. Bowl fife, the time for crispiness to disappear after soaking in milk, decreased with addition of peanut flour. Sensory evaluation was conducted for crispiness, color, flavor and overall acceptance using the 9 -point hedonic scale (I = dislike extremely, 9 like extremely). Peanut flavor was also evaluated (I = none, 9 = strong). Untrained sensory panelists (n = 48) evaluated 5 samples of flakes (O%, 10 %, 20 %, 30 % R-PDPF and 30 % PDPF) I min after addition of milk. All flakes were rated acceptable (score > 5. 0). Surprisingly, peanut flavor intensity was the highest for flakes containing 30 % PDPF, rather than the R-PDPF...|$|E
40|$|Most ready-to-eat (RTE) {{breakfast cereals}} ha ve a sol id, porous starch-protein matrix and are {{consumed}} immersed in milk. Changes in the microstructure of cereal during {{the addition of}} liquid prior to consumption are poorly understood. The hypothesis of this work is that the microstructure of R TE breakfast flakes {{is related to the}} physical properties of the flakes and the liquid absorption process during soaking. The overall objective of this thesis was to increase knowledge about the relationship between the microstructure of RTE <b>cereal</b> <b>flakes</b> and their properties (e. g., texture, liquid absorption, etc.) during soaking. To achieve this objective, the following four studies were undertaken using individual flake units: a) proposal of methodology to characterize cross section porosity of RTE breakfast cereals; b) determination of the amount of water and milk absorbed by com flakes (CF) and frosted flakes (FF) using scintillation counting and tritiated water; e) assessment of the rupture force (RF) of CF and quino a flakes (QF) measured directly in water and milk; and d) changes on surface image texture features extracted from gray-scale matrices of CF and FF during soaking in water. Results of an image analysis of chemically fixed CF and QF samples indicate that CF (0. 37) has a higher estimated cross-section porosity that QF (0. 28). The surface liquid adhesion (SLA) concept was defined to quantify the amount of liquid absorbed by the flake at the beginning ofthe soaking process. The SLA increased with higher fat content in milk and was consistently higher for FF when compared to CF. Liquid absorption increased with soaking time and was 50 % higher for CF than for FF under the same liquid conditions. Comparison of individual milk absorption of flakes with conventional soaking experiments using a group of flakes demonstrated that absorption in bulk overestimated the liquid absorbed by individual flakes by ~ 75 %. RF values were higher for QF than for CF under similar conditions and were reduced in three consecutive periods as the soaking time increased. Samples soaked in water exhibited more pronounced changes in microstructure than samples soaked in milk, likely due to the fat content in milk. Analysis of image texture features showed that flake surfaces tended to be more homogenous as soaking time increased. Microstructural examination of flakes using scanning electron microscope (SEM) (showed that the externa} surfaces of CF, FF and QF were quite dense. FF and QF had a more homogeneous and smoother surface than CF, due to a sugar coating. Cross-sections revealed an internal porous structure composed of several air cells of different dimensions. In CF and FF, several large air cells protruded into the surface and became separated by a thin layer, whereas smaller air cells were embedded within a thick, dense so lid matrix. The number of elongated air cells in QF were reduced compared to CF and FF, giving the impression that the QF matrix was formed by stacked layers. Therefore, the microstructure characteristics of flakes and their changes during soaking as a consequence of liquid uptake and reduction of mechanical properties is a key factor in understanding the physical phenomena associated with bowl life.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Analisar a conformidade de rótulos de alimentos para lactentes e crianças de primeira infância, segundo os preceitos da ética e das legislações vigentes. MÉTODOS: Foram analisados 86 rótulos captados por livre acesso, amostragem intencional, distribuídos em: fórmulas infantis para lactentes (n= 11), fórmulas de seguimento para lactentes (n= 5); alimentos de transição (n= 7); alimentos à base de cereais (n= 11), leites e alimentos à base de vegetais (n= 52) e alimentos comuns usualmente empregados na alimentação desse público (n= 13). Foram preenchidos formulários estruturados com itens das Resoluções da Diretoria Colegiada 222 / 02, 977 / 98, 40 / 01, 40 / 02, 259 / 02, 23 / 00 e das Portarias 34 / 98 e 36 / 98 para cada alimento. Aplicaram-se os Testes Qui-Quadrado, Exato de Fisher e de Correlação. RESULTADOS: A freqüência de não conformidades na rotulagem específica foi muito maior que na rotulagem geral. A maior freqüência de não conformidades observada foi a apresentação de ilustrações inadequadas nos alimentos (imagens de lactentes ou crianças com figuras humanizadas). Outras inconformidades foram: a presença de expressões como leite humanizado, baby ou frases que dão falsa idéia de vantagem ou segurança; e a ausência de frases obrigatórias e não conformidade quanto à composição do produto. Alimentos que não tinham como designação de venda nenhuma das características de uso comum nesta faixa etária, ou seja, não eram comercializados como tal, como farinha láctea, flocos de cereais e mingaus, apresentavam frases de advertência não necessárias para aquele tipo de produto. CONCLUSÃO: A rotulagem de alimentos para lactentes e crianças de primeira infância apresenta muitas irregularidades, principalmente no que se refere à rotulagem específica do produto. Essa prática pode repercutir sobre a amamentação. A fiscalização deve ser intensificada, conjuntamente com maiores esclarecimentos às indústrias de alimentos e aos consumidores em geral. OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to analyze label conformity of foods for infants and lactating women according to ethical principles and current regulations. METHODS: A total of 86 labels acquired by free access and intentional sampling were analyzed, distributed as follows: infant formulas (n= 11), follow-on formulas (n= 5), complementary foods (n= 07), cereal products (n= 11), milk and foods containing vegetables (n= 52), and food commonly used to feed this population (n= 13). Structured forms were filled out with items from the Resoluções da Diretoria Colegiada (Graduated Board Resolutions) 222 / 02, 977 / 98, 40 / 01, 40 / 02, 259 / 02, 23 / 00 and of the Portarias (rules) 34 / 98 and 36 / 98 for each food. The chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and correlation test were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The rate of specific label non-conformity was much greater than that of general labeling. The highest rate of non-conformity was observed in the presentation of illustrations of the foods (images of breastfeeding infants or children with humanized images). Other non-conformities were: the presence of words such as humanized milk, baby or phrases that give a false idea of advantage or safety; the absence of mandatory phrases and non-conformity regarding the composition of the food. Foods that did not have as sales designation any of the characteristics of common use in this age group, that is, that were not marketed as such, such as lacteal flour, <b>cereal</b> <b>flakes</b> and paps presented warning phrases that were not necessarily for that kind of product.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} a number of aspects of the <b>cereal</b> <b>flaking</b> process. Little has been written about this commercially important process. Included in the objectives of this work were the prediction of the effect of pellet shape, size and feed rate and roll size and speed of the shape of the flakes produced and the power and forces required, the effect of these operating variables on the formation of multiple flakes (a determinant of system capacity), and the effect of operating variables on the physicochemical properties of the flakes produced. These objectives were met by a combination of a number of computer simulations of the process and experimental production of flakes in a commercial pilot plant. The simulations at least qualitatively predict the effect of the important processing variables on flake shape, power, forces, and the formation of multiple flakes. The models and data also indicate that the process is extremely noisy, exhibiting somewhat unpredictable behavior. It is believed that the deviances between the models and operating data is a consequence of errors in determination of pellet rheology, the models 2 ̆ 7 assumption of a constant temperature process, and the models 2 ̆ 7 inability to describe extensional and viscoelastic flows that are clearly occurring.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of commercial fibre cereals on the rate of gastric emptying, postprandial glucose response and satiety in healthy subjects. Methods Gastric emptying rate (GER) was measured by standardized real time ultrasonography. Twelve healthy subjects were assessed using a randomized crossover blinded trial. The subjects were examined after an 8 hour fast and after assessment of normal fasting blood glucose level. Satiety scores were estimated and blood glucose measurements were taken before and at 0, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 min after the end of the meal. GER was calculated as the percentage change in the antral cross-sectional area 15 and 90 min after ingestion of sour milk with corn <b>flakes</b> (GER 1), <b>cereal</b> bran <b>flakes</b> (GER 2) or wholemeal oat flakes (GER 3). Results The median value was, respectively, 42 % for GER 1, 33 % for GER 2 and 51 % for GER 3. The difference between the GER after ingestion of bran flakes compared to wholemeal oat flakes was statistically significant (p = 0. 023). The postprandial delta blood glucose level was statistically significantly lower at 40 min (p = 0. 045) and 120 min (p = 0. 023) after the <b>cereal</b> bran <b>flakes</b> meal.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Two food-grade sorghum hybrids, ATx 63 I *Tx 436 (non waxy), and B. BON 34, (waxy), were micronized and evaluated for their potential use in ready to eat breakfast cereals (RTE-BC). Whole and decorticated grains were exposed to infra-red burners and flaked between corrugated rollers. Whole B. BON 34 flakes had the lowest density, best flavor, good texture, and the greatest starch gelatinization. Decorticated B. BON 34 flakes were extremely thin and fragile. Based on flake characteristics, whole B. BON 34 and decorticated ATx 631 *Tx 436 flakes were selected for granola preparation. Whole ATx 631 *Tx 436 flakes (27. 4 % amylose) were used for the preparation of a <b>flaked</b> <b>cereal</b> with reduced rate of starch hydrolysis. Granolas were prepared by mixing, baking, and cooling sorghum flakes, wheat bran, sesame and sunflower seeds, raisins, sorghum molasses, oil, fructose and water. A control granola was prepared with rolled oats instead of sorg-hum flakes. All 9 granolas were crispy, sweet, and had a nutty flavor. Decorticated ATx 631 *Tx 436 granola had the hardest texture, and remained crispy in milk for the longest time. Whole B. BON 34 granola was preferred (p< 0. 05, N= 36) by a sensory panel over the decorticated ATx 631 *Tx 436 one. A <b>flaked</b> <b>cereal</b> was prepared by mixing, extruding, flaking, and baking ground, whole ATx 631 *Tx 436 flakes with high amylose starch, mono and diglycerides. sugar, salt, and water. <b>Flaked</b> <b>cereal</b> with the highest amylose content had the slowest rate of hydrolysis and the least starch gelatinization. Acceptable RTE-BC can be produced from food- grade sorghums with different endospen-n types using different technologies. Waxy sorg(hum produced the best flakes for granola preparation. Non-waxy sorghum produced the best <b>flaked</b> <b>cereal</b> with relatively slow rate of hydrolysis...|$|R
40|$|Presented diploma thesis {{was focused}} on study of {{phenolic}} substances in various cereal products. Flours, brans and germs from various <b>cereals,</b> <b>flakes</b> and extruded <b>cereals</b> were chosen as samples. Phenolic substances were analyzed by spectrophotometry, RP-HPLC/UV-VIS and RP-HPLC/PDA/ESI-MS. Studies of saccharide content which were analyzed by spectrophotometry and HPLC/RI was incorporated to this thesis. Differences {{in the content of}} phenolic substances released from glycosides after acid hydrolysis of samples and differences in saccharide content determined after acid and enzymatic hydrolysis of samples were investigated. Simple sensory analysis of extruded cereal products of different flavour (cocoa, honey, chocolate) was carried out too. In analyzed samples the highest content of total phenolics and total flavonoids was measured in wheat germs. Especially in wheat germs and also in buckwheat and oat flakes, maize brans and cereals products Teddy (cereal balls with cocoa) and Ferda (cereal grains with honey) high levels of individual catechins, phenolic acids and flavonoids were determined too. The quantity of phenolic substances increased for several times in samples processed by acid hydrolysis in comparison to non-hydrolyzed samples. The high content of total saccharides, reduced saccharides and individual mono- and disaccharides was found mainly in extruded products. Concentration of monosaccharides increased in acid hydrolyzed samples in spite of disaccharides concentration that was higher only in some of hydrolyzed samples. In several cases final disaccharide concentrations were lower in hydrolyzed samples than in non-hydrolyzed ones...|$|R

The sensory evaluation showed the effectiveness of tocopherols in limiting the development of off-flavour during storage. The analysis of the volatile compounds, focused on the secondary products of the lipid oxidation, showed that the antioxidant activity of tocopherols limited the evolution of the headspace towards a more intense oxidation, notably the further oxidation of hexanal into hexanoic acid (that reached 32...|$|R
