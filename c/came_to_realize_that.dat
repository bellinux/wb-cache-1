5|$|Over {{the years}} Coffin <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> {{many of the}} goods he sold in his {{business}} were produced with slave labor. Through his travels Coffin learned of organizations in Philadelphia and New York City that only sold goods produced with free (non-slave) labor. He began to purchase stock from these organizations and marketed free-labor goods to his fellow abolitionists, though the products provided him with little profit.|$|E
5|$|Musial {{was named}} a vice {{president}} of the St. Louis Cardinals in September 1963, and he remained in that position until after the 1966 season. From February 1964 to January 1967, he also served as President Lyndon Johnson's physical fitness adviser, a part-time position created to promote better fitness among American citizens. Before the 1967 season began, the Cardinals named Musial the team's general manager, and he oversaw the club's World Series championship that year. He won the allegiance of Cardinals players by making fair offers from the outset of player-contract negotiations and creating an in-stadium babysitting service so players' wives could attend games. His longtime business partner Biggie Garagnani died in June 1967, prompting Musial to devote more time to managing his restaurant and other business interests. He <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the detail-oriented desk job was not his forte. He consequently decided to step down as general manager, before even completing a full year on the job.|$|E
5|$|The rate {{of growth}} of the Antarctic scallop is very slow {{compared}} to that of scallops living in warmer seas. It matures at 5 to 7 years old and spawning takes place in late summer. Little is known about the development of the veliger larvae but they may be planktonic for 4 or 5 months. Besides feeding on phytoplankton and small zooplankton, they may absorb dissolved organic matter and consume bacterioplankton. When they settle, metamorphosis takes place and the juveniles attach themselves with byssus threads, often attaching these to the upper valves of scallops, and remain attached for 3 to 5 years. While attached to the adult shell, the juveniles benefit from food particles in the fine detritus thrown up into the water column by movements of the adult. While studying the sizes and growth rates of adults, researchers <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> there were gaps in their records which were due to the fact that, in some years, no juveniles had survived.|$|E

25|$|Alhazen disproved Ptolemy's {{theory of}} vision, {{but did not}} make any {{corresponding}} changes to Aristotle's metaphysics. The scientific revolution ran concurrently to a process where elements of Aristotle's metaphysics such as ethics, teleology and formal causality slowly fell out of favour. Scholars slowly <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the universe itself might well be devoid of both purpose and ethical imperatives. Many of the restrictions described by Aristotle and later favoured by the Catholic Church were thus challenged. This development from a physics infused with goals, ethics, and spirit, toward a physics where these elements do not play an integral role, took centuries.|$|E
25|$|For their part, Frankfurt School theorists quickly <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> a dialectical method {{could only}} be adopted {{if it could be}} applied to itself—that is to say, if they adopted a self-correcting method—a dialectical method that would enable them to correct {{previous}} false dialectical interpretations. Accordingly, critical theory rejected the historicism and materialism of orthodox Marxism. Indeed, the material tensions and class struggles of which Marx spoke were no longer seen by Frankfurt School theorists as having the same revolutionary potential within contemporary Western societies—an observation that indicated that Marx's dialectical interpretations and predictions were either incomplete or incorrect.|$|E
25|$|As Lovell {{designed}} mausoleums, he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> {{there were}} fundamental problems facing above-ground burial. It had been common for centuries for above-ground burial vaults to be tightly sealed, {{to prevent the}} leakage of fluids {{and the spread of}} nauseating odors (both generated by the decomposition of the human body) from vaults. Tightly sealed vaults, however, allowed decomposition gases to build up, causing vaults to violently rupture ("exploding vault syndrome") and scatter partly-decomposed remains inside the mausoleum. Lovell designed a solution, which involved building a ventilation system and drainage system behind the vaults. He applied for a patent, which was granted on October 23, 1917 (patent number 1,244,109).|$|E

25|$|Early in her {{scientific}} career, Doudna {{worked to}} uncover the structure and biological function of RNA enzymes or ribozymes. While in the Szostak lab, Doudna reengineered the self-splicing Group I catalytic intron into a true catalytic ribozyme that would copy RNA templates. Her focus was on engineering ribozymes and understanding their underlaying mechanisms. However, she <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> {{not being able to}} see the molecular mechanisms of ribozymes was a major problem. She went to the lab of Thomas Cech at the University of Colorado Boulder to crystallize and determine the three-dimensional structure of ribozymes. She started this project in the Cech lab in 1991 and finished it at Yale University in 1996. She joined Yale's Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry as an assistant professor in 1994.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Kooman {{first became}} aware of the issue of human {{trafficking}} while he was working for the Christian nonprofit organization Youth With A Mission (YWAM) in southeast Malaysia, where he met child victims of human trafficking, but Kooman later <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> human trafficking is an issue in Canada as well; the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) estimate that between 600 and 800 people are trafficked into Canada every year. Kooman has spoken about the cases in which people have been trafficked into Calgary and Edmonton in order to work in the sex industry, and has posited that sex workers have likely been trafficked into his hometown of Red Deer as well since it is also located along Alberta Highway 2. Kooman continued to work in Malaysia with YWAM for two years, towards the end of which time he visited Singapore, where he attended an international conference on human trafficking, there learning details on the issue that shocked him. The conference focused on the military use of children and the prostitution of children. One of the facts that stuck with Kooman was that there are children aged five and under who are forcibly prostituted daily, and that many of these children end up spending their entire lives as human trafficking victims. Kooman is the director of Raise Their Voice, a creative, justice-driven, nonprofit organisation in Red Deer. The other four members of the organization are his family members.|$|E
25|$|Several {{months into}} the year, Hone {{disappeared}} without a trace and upon his return, it was revealed he had illegally snuck a refugee into the country. Michael fired Hone but later welcomed {{him back to the}} clinic. Hone's nephew Manny (Albert Belz) arrived to stay with Hone but got into trouble with gangs. Whilst defending his nephew, Hone punched a gang member and was shocked when Chris declared the man dead. Hone was arrested on a murder charge but was cleared and began to date his lawyer Caitlin Devereux (Sarah Smuts-Kennedy), who left her husband for him. After the trial in 1995, Hone and Caitlin decided to set up a clinic on the East Coast and the couple departed Ferndale with the assistance of Chris and Carmen (Theresa Healey). 13 years later, Hone returned to the hospital to audit the hospital under the supervision of Martha Riley (Jacque Drew). Chris and TK Samuels (Benjamin Mitchell) soon <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> Hone was seriously mentally unstable following a series of murders and rapes in his clinic in Africa. Hone replaced Chris as the hospital's Chief Executive Officer but quickly tired of the job and began an affair with Tania Jeffries (Faye Smythe). However Hone soon came to realize his fragile mentality and broke it off with Tania and fled to Australia. In 2012 Chris told Henare Ngatai (George Henare) that the two had previously been introduced by Hone.|$|E

Grant later <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> his prediction of one great battle bringing the war to a close would probably not occur. The war would continue, at great cost in casualties and resources, until the Confederacy succumbed or the Union was divided. Grant also learned a valuable personal lesson on preparedness that (mostly) served him well {{for the rest of}} the war.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} an American historic district was as a protective area surrounding more important, individual historic sites. As the field of historic preservation progressed, those involved <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the structures acting as [...] "buffer zones" [...] were actually key elements of the historic integrity of larger, landmark sites. Preservationists came {{to the view that}} districts should be more encompassing, blending together a mesh of structures, streets, open space and landscaping to define the historical character of a historic district.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} the war the Presbyterian {{group in}} the Commons, led by Denzil Holles, William Strode, and Sir Philip Stapleton, was {{slightly}} stronger than the Independents. [...] They proceeded to introduce legislation hostile to the views on religious tolerance held by Vane and Independents in the army. [...] Vane apparently <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the Presbyterian actions posed a threat equal to that of the Episcopalians, and that military action, having sidelined the latter, might also work against the former. [...] There was also mutual distrust between Vane and the Levellers, because Vane held the somewhat aristocratic view that voting rights should be reserved to the propertied gentry. [...] The Independents attempted to negotiate terms favourable to them with Charles, but these were unsuccessful.|$|E
