50|$|Fluid is any {{substance}} that flows; e.g. oil, water, gas, and ice are all examples of fluids. Under extreme pressure and temperature almost anything will become fluid.Fluid exerts pressure and this pressure is {{as a result}} of the density and the height of the fluid column. Most oil companies usually represent density measurement in pounds per gallon (ppg) or kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m3) and pressure measurement in pounds per square inch (psi) or bar or pascal (Pa). Pressure increases as the density of the fluid increases.To find out the amount of pressure a fluid of a known density exerts for each unit of length, the pressure gradient is used.A pressure gradient is defined as the pressure increase per unit of the depth due to its density and it is usually measured in pounds per square inch per foot or bars per meter.It is expressed mathematically as;pressure gradient = fluid density × conversion factor.The <b>conversion</b> <b>factor</b> <b>used</b> to convert density to pressure is 0.052 in English system and 0.0981 in Metric system.|$|E

The use of 31 P-ZTE for skull attenuation increases 18 F activity {{as compared to the}} activity when NoBone-AC is used but also as compared to the activity when CT-AC is used. This reveals an overestimation of 18 F activity by the 31 P-based approach, corresponding to an overestimation of skull density.

40|$|International audienceSince {{the seminal}} work of Zawadzki in the seventies, the {{so-called}} Taylor's "frozen" hypothesis has been regularly used to study the statistical properties of rainfall patterns. This hypothesis yields a drastic simplification in terms of symmetry of the space-time structure-the large-scale advection velocity is the <b>conversion</b> <b>factor</b> <b>used</b> to link the time and space autocorrelation functions (ACFs) of the small-scale variability. This study revisits the frozen hypothesis with a geostatistical model. Using analytical developments and numerical simulations tuned on available case studies from the literature, the role of large- and small-scale rainfall kinematics on {{the properties of the}} space-time ACF and associated fluctuations is investigated. In particular, the merits and limits of the ACF signature classically used to test the frozen hypothesis are examined. The conclusion is twofold. Taylor's hypothesis, understood as the quest for a space-time symmetry in rain field variability, remains important in hydrometeorology four decades after the pioneering work of Zawadzki. The frozen hypothesis, introduced for simplification purposes, appears difficult to check and too constraining. The methods proposed to check the hypothesis rely too directly {{on the use of the}} advection velocity as a space-time conversion factor instead of contemplating the ACF signature more globally. The model proposed that using two characteristic velocities instead of one appears more flexible to fit the ACF behaviors presented in the literature.

The inputs and outputs of major nutrients (only five farms) as well as energy were calculated and mean values are presented. N inputs were five times higher than outputs and reduction in N fertilization can be considered. Total energy inputs were 50. 7 GJ ha(- 1) and outputs 118. 5 GJ ha(- 1) (51. 6 GJ ha(- 1) from fruit).

Thus, energy savings could be obtained without significant yield reduction, mainly through reducing fertilizer inputs (especially N), diminishing pest control applications through proper techniques and improving the farm road network.

40|$|International audienceThe {{vertical}} water flow, {{heat flow}} and transport of the herbicide methabenzthiazuron were monitored for 627 days in lysimeters sampled at a field site {{close to the}} research centre Jülich, Germany. During this period the lysimeters were cropped with winter wheat, winter barley and oat. The models TRACE, MARTHE, ANSWERS and MACRO were applied to the lysimeter data with the scope of upscaling local scale process understanding for regional scale. MARTHE and TRACE solve the 3 -d Richards' equation for variably saturated water flow. MACRO is a 1 -d model based on the Richards' Equation and accounting for preferential flow in the unsaturated zone, while ANSWERS is a regional scale capacity based watershed model. Measurements of soil moisture, evapotranspiration, drainage, soil temperature, pesticide residues and leaching are used for comparison with model results. Although the adopted models differ in terms of model concepts, the use of model performance indices proved a proper simulation of water flow for all models. The heat flow is also well described with ANSWERS, MARTHE and MACRO. Larger deviations were found between model results and measured pesticide transport. An inadequate reproduction of the measured MBT degradation was found for the available model input parameters. A very small amount of MBT leaching, observed in the measurements, was only reproduced with MACRO after strong calibration. In other respects only plant parameters were calibrated.

40|$|Objectives: The routine use of {{prophylactic}} antibiotics in neurosurgery {{has been}} shown to significantly reduce surgical site infection rates. The documentation of non-surgical site, nosocomial infections in neurosurgical patients remains limited, despite this being a stimulus for prolific antibiotic usage. The actual quantum of antibiotic use in neurosurgery and its role in infection control remain both undocumented and controversial. The authors address this issue with a cost-effectiveness study using historical controls. Materials and Methods: Bacteriologically positive body fluid samples were used to quantify infection rates in the year 2006 and compared with those in the year 1997. Itemized drug lists obtained from dedicated neurosurgical intensive care units and wards were used to quantify antibiotic usage and calculate their costs. Results were compared using both historical and internal controls. The monetary <b>conversion</b> <b>factor</b> <b>used</b> was INR 40 =US$ 1. Results: A total of 3114 consecutive elective and emergency neurosurgical procedures were performed during the study period. 329 patients (10. 6 %) were recorded to have bacteriologically positive body fluid samples, and 100, 250 units of antibiotics were consumed costing Rs. 14, 378, 227. 5 ($ 359, 455. 7). On an average, an operated patient received 32. 2 units of antibiotics valued at Rs. 4, 617 ($ 115. 4).

40|$|International audienceA {{method has}} been {{developed}} for estimating the content in foods of the emulsifying additive E 473, sucrose esters of fatty acids. The analytical approach taken to estimate the complex mixtures that comprise this additive involved, selective solvent extraction of the intact esters using a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and ethyl acetate, alkaline hydrolysis of the esters to liberate sucrose, and then GC-MS measurement of the liberated sucrose using GC-MS after acidic hydrolysis to glucose and fructose and then silylation. The method was developed to aid future estimates of intake of this food additive. The method determines the total sucrose esters content of a food sample and does not attempt to discrimination between individual sucrose esters when present as a mixture in a food sample. A single (average) factor is used to convert the liberated sucrose content into sucrose ester content. The method was applied to analysis of 8 different food types (including bakery wares, sugar confectionery, dairy product, margarine, meat pies and a sauce) spiked with 0. 5 to 1 % of a mixture of 3 sucrose esters that spanned the hydrophilic/lipophilic balance (HLB) range 1 - 16.
