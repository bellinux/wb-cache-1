25|$|<b>Celebrex</b> (celecoxib) for arthritis.|$|E
25|$|Any {{increased}} risk of renal and arrhythmia pathologies associated with the class of COX-2 inhibitors, e.g. celecoxib (<b>Celebrex),</b> valdecoxib (Bextra), parecoxib (Dynastat), lumiracoxib, and etoricoxib is not evident, although smaller studies had demonstrated such effects earlier {{with the use of}} celecoxib, valdecoxib and parecoxib.|$|E
25|$|Others include Merck's etoricoxib (Arcoxia), Pfizer’s {{celecoxib}} (<b>Celebrex)</b> and valdecoxib (Bextra). Interestingly, at {{the time}} of its withdrawal, rofecoxib was the only coxib with clinical evidence of its superior gastrointestinal adverse effect profile over conventional NSAIDs. This was largely based on the VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, BYU {{reached a}} legal {{settlement}} with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer over a long-disputed patent claim involving the research behind the successful drug <b>Celebrex.</b> While the settlement amount was not disclosed, Pfizer's quarterly filings initially earmarked at least $450 million (BYU originally sought over $9 billion); {{is expected that}} this and likely future payments will have significant impact on BYU's endowment and research funding.|$|E
25|$|Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen, {{can cause}} flares of {{inflammatory bowel disease}} in approximately 25% of patients. These flares tend to occur within one week after starting regular use of the NSAID. In contrast, acetaminophen (paracetamol) and aspirin appear to be safe. Celecoxib (<b>Celebrex),</b> a cox-2 inhibitor, {{also appears to be}} safe, at least in short-term studies of patients in remission and on medication for their Crohn's disease.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Pfizer {{merged with}} Pharmacia. The merger was again driven {{in part by}} the desire to acquire full rights to a product, this time <b>Celebrex</b> (celecoxib), the COX-2 {{selective}} inhibitor previously jointly marketed by Searle (acquired by Pharmacia) and Pfizer. In the ensuing years, Pfizer carried out a massive restructuring that resulted in numerous site closures and the loss of jobs including Terre Haute, Indiana; Holland, Michigan; Groton, Connecticut; Brooklyn, New York; Sandwich, UK; and Puerto Rico.|$|E
25|$|The {{impetus for}} {{development}} of selective COX-2 inhibitors was the adverse gastrointestinal side-effects of NSAIDs. Soon after {{the discovery of the}} mechanism of action of NSAIDs, strong indications emerged for alternative forms of COX, but little supporting evidence was found. COX enzyme proved to be difficult to purify and was not sequenced until 1988. In 1991 the existence of the COX-2 enzyme was confirmed by being cloned by Dr. Dan Simmons at Brigham Young University. Before the confirmation of COX-2 existence, the Dupont company had developed a compound, DuP-697, that was potent in many anti-inflammatory assays but did not have the ulcerogenic effects of NSAIDs. Once the COX-2 enzyme was identified, Dup-697 became the building-block for synthesis of COX-2 inhibitors. Celecoxib and rofecoxib, the first COX-2 inhibitors to reach market, were based on DuP-697. It took less than eight years to develop and market the first COX-2 inhibitor, with <b>Celebrex</b> (celecoxib) launched in December 1998 and Vioxx (rofecoxib) launched in May 1999.|$|E
2500|$|Controversy arose {{over the}} drug [...] "Celebrex". Brigham Young University (BYU) {{said that a}} {{professor}} of chemistry, Dr. Daniel L. Simmons, discovered an enzyme in the 1990s that would later lead towards the development of <b>Celebrex.</b> BYU was originally seeking 15% royalty on sales, which would equate to $9.7 billion. The court filings show that a research agreement was made with Monsanto, whose pharmaceutical business was later acquired by Pfizer, to develop a better aspirin. The enzyme that Dr. Simmons claims to have discovered would induce pain and inflammation while causing gastrointestinal problems, which <b>Celebrex</b> is used to reduce those issues. A battle ensued, lasting over six years, because BYU claimed that Pfizer did not give him credit or compensation while Pfizer claims it had met all obligations regarding the Monsanto agreement. This culminated in a $450 million amicable settlement without going to trial. Pfizer {{said it would take}} a $450 million charge against first quarter earnings to settle.|$|E
2500|$|Utah DOPL and PCM {{enter into}} The Utah Consent Order in December 2002. The Consent Order {{required}} KwikMed (PCM) {{to design and}} implement an appropriate interactive medical assessment tool {{to be used by}} website users to ensure that each user provides a complete detailed medical history and physical evaluation sufficient to enable PCM's contract physicians to establish a diagnosis and to identify underlying conditions and/or contra-indications to the treatments recommended by those physicians. By the terms of this agreement, PCM was required to secure the DOPL's approval before any additional drugs could be prescribed and dispensed via the website. These medications included the erectile dysfunction medication Viagra and the male pattern hair loss medication Propecia. [...] Although DOPL originally granted approval for PCM to dispense the weight loss drug Xenical and the arthritis medication <b>Celebrex,</b> PCM later asked to have these two removed from its approved list of drugs based on PCM's concern over the safety of these medications. Later, two addition erectile dysfunction medications, Cialis and Levitra, and the smoking cessation medication,Chantix, were added to the list of approved medications for PCM to distribute with a valid prescription.|$|E
50|$|After the {{withdrawal}} of rofecoxib from the market in September 2004, <b>Celebrex</b> enjoyed a robust increase in sales. However, {{the results of the}} APC trial in December of that year raised concerns that <b>Celebrex</b> might carry risks similar to those of rofecoxib, and Pfizer announced a moratorium on direct-to-consumer advertising of <b>Celebrex</b> soon afterwards. After a significant drop, sales of <b>Celebrex</b> have recovered, and reached $2 billion in 2006.|$|E
50|$|Pfizer resumed {{advertising}} <b>Celebrex</b> {{in magazines}} in 2006, and resumed television advertising in April 2007 with an unorthodox, -minute advertisement which extensively discussed {{the adverse effects}} of <b>Celebrex</b> in comparison with other anti-inflammatory drugs. The ad drew criticism from the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, which called the ad's comparisons misleading. Pfizer responded to Public Citizen's concerns with assurances that they are truthfully advertising the risk and benefits of <b>Celebrex</b> as set forth by the FDA.|$|E

50|$|In 1985, Monsanto {{acquired}} G. D. Searle & Company, a {{life sciences}} company {{that focused on}} pharmaceuticals, agriculture and animal health. In 1993, its Searle division filed a patent application for <b>Celebrex,</b> which in 1998 became the first selective COX‑2 inhibitor {{to be approved by}} the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). <b>Celebrex</b> became a blockbuster drug and was often mentioned as a key reason for Pfizer's acquisition of Monsanto's pharmaceutical business in 2002.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{initially}} marketed by Pfizer for arthritis. Celecoxib is available by prescription in capsule form. Despite the American Heart Association warning that people {{at high risk}} for heart disease should only use celecoxib if there are not other possible treatments and that celecoxib costs about five times more than acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen — which are equally effective for pain relief, 11 million prescriptions of <b>celebrex</b> are filled each year. <b>Celebrex</b> was one of Pfizer's [...] "best-selling drugs, amounting to more than $2.5 billion in sales 2012, and was prescribed to 2.4 million" [...] people in 2011. By 2012, 33 million Americans had taken <b>Celebrex.</b> , the cost for a typical month of medication in the United States was more than $200. , the cost for of a generic version of celecoxib was closer to $30.|$|E
50|$|Pfizer markets {{celecoxib}} {{under the}} brand name <b>Celebrex,</b> and it is available as oral capsules containing 50, 100, 200 or 400 mg of celecoxib.|$|E
50|$|In late 2007, Pfizer {{released}} another US television ad for <b>Celebrex,</b> {{which also}} discussed celecoxib's adverse effects {{in comparison with}} those of other anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E
5000|$|FDA advisors have {{recommended}} that Pfizer {{be required to}} place a boxed warning on their non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug <b>Celebrex</b> (celecoxib) for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risks.|$|E
5000|$|Served as lead patent {{counsel for}} Pfizer in a patent {{infringement}} lawsuit against Teva Pharmaceuticals in which Teva attempted {{to bring a}} generic version of <b>Celebrex</b> to market.|$|E
5000|$|Although Pfizer [...] "underwrote much of Dr. Reuben’s {{research}} from 2002 to 2007" [...] and [...] "many of his trials found that <b>Celebrex</b> and Lyrica, Pfizer drugs, were effective against postoperative pain" [...] Pfizer {{was not aware}} of the fraudulent data.|$|E
50|$|Any {{increased}} risk of renal and arrhythmia pathologies associated with the class of COX-2 inhibitors, e.g. celecoxib (<b>Celebrex),</b> valdecoxib (Bextra), parecoxib (Dynastat), lumiracoxib, and etoricoxib is not evident, although smaller studies had demonstrated such effects earlier {{with the use of}} celecoxib, valdecoxib and parecoxib.|$|E
50|$|Celecoxib, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} <b>Celebrex</b> among others, is a COX-2 {{selective}} nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It is used to treat the pain and inflammation of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, acute pain in adults, painful menstruation, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in people two years or older.|$|E
5000|$|The VIGOR (Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research) trial, [...] "which was {{the making}} of Merck's drug rofecoxib (Vioxx)," [...] {{was at the center}} of a dispute about the ethics of medical journals. VIGOR trial,1 was a trial in which over 8000 {{patients}} were randomized to receive either naproxen or rofecoxib (Vioxx), a Cox-2 inhibitor that Merck hoped would have fewer gastrointestinal side effects." [...] Both publications concluded that COX-2 specific NSAIDs were associated with significantly fewer adverse gastrointestinal effects. In the CLASS trial comparing <b>Celebrex</b> 800 mg/day to ibuprofen 2400 mg/day and diclofenac 150 mg/day for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis for six months, <b>Celebrex</b> was associated with significantly fewer upper gastrointestinal complications (0.44% vs. 1.27%, P=0.04), with no significant difference in incidence of cardiovascular events in patients not taking aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis.|$|E
50|$|According to the National Academy of Sciences, Philip Needleman, who {{was vice}} {{president}} of Monsanto in 1989 and president of Searle in 1993 oversaw research into COX-2 {{that led to the}} development of the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib (<b>Celebrex).</b> He became senior executive vice president and chief scientist of Pharmacia from 2000 to 2003. Celecoxib was discovered and developed by G. D. Searle & Company and was approved by the FDA on December 31, 1998. It was co-promoted by Monsanto Company (parent company of Searle) and Pfizer under the brand name <b>Celebrex.</b> Monsanto merged with Pharmacia, from which the Medical Research Division was acquired by Pfizer, giving Pfizer ownership of <b>Celebrex.</b> The drug was at the core of a major patent dispute that was resolved in Searle's favor (later Pfizer) in 2004. In University of Rochester v. G.D. Searle & Co., 358 F.3d 916 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the University of Rochester claimed that United States Pat. No. 6,048,850 (which claimed a method of inhibiting COX-2 in humans using a compound, without actually disclosing what that compound might be) covered drugs such as celecoxib. The court ruled in favor of Searle, holding in essence that the University had claimed a method requiring, yet provided no written description of, a compound that could inhibit COX-2 and therefore the patent was invalid.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999 Monsanto {{sold off}} NutraSweet Co. In December {{of the same}} year, Monsanto agreed to merge with Pharmacia & Upjohn, in a deal valuing the {{transaction}} at $27 billion. The agricultural division became a wholly owned subsidiary of the [...] "new" [...] Pharmacia; Monsanto's medical research division, which included products such as <b>Celebrex.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} the rapid {{widespread}} acceptance of <b>Celebrex</b> and Vioxx by physicians was the publication of two large trials, the Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS) in JAMA, and the Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research (VIGOR). The VIGOR trial was later proven to {{have been based on}} faulty data, and Vioxx was eventually withdrawn from the market.|$|E
50|$|In 1989 left academia for {{industry}} and became {{vice president of}} Monsanto. In 1993 he became president of Searle. There he oversaw research into COX-2 {{that led to the}} development of the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib (<b>Celebrex)</b> which resulted in the 1998 Food and Drug Administration (FDA). He became senior executive vice president and chief scientist of Pharmacia from 2000 to 2003.|$|E
50|$|Others include Merck's etoricoxib (Arcoxia), Pfizer’s {{celecoxib}} (<b>Celebrex)</b> and valdecoxib (Bextra).

50|$|<b>Celebrex</b> (and other {{brand names}} for celecoxib) was {{introduced}} in 1999 and rapidly became the most frequently prescribed new drug in the United States. By October 2000, its US sales exceeded 100 million prescriptions per year for $3 billion, and was still rising. Sales of <b>Celebrex</b> alone reached $3.1 billion in 2001. A Spanish study found that between January 2000 and June 2001, 7% of NSAID prescriptions and 29% of NSAID expenditures were for COX-2 inhibitors. Over {{the period of the}} study, COX-2 inhibitors rose from 10.03% of total NSAIDs prescribed by specialty physicians to 29.79%, and from 1.52% to 10.78% of NSAIDs prescribed by primary care physicians (98.23% of NSAIDs and 94.61% of COX-2 inhibitors were prescribed by primary care physicians). For specialty physicians, rofecoxib and celecoxib were third and fifth most frequently prescribed NSAIDs but first and second in cost, respectively; for primary-care physicians they were ninth and twelfth most frequently prescribed NSAIDs and first and fourth in cost.|$|E
50|$|Commercializing the {{patented}} work of Philippe Pradelles and others, Cayman {{exploited the}} acetylcholinesterase enzyme of electric eels {{to develop a}} range of sensitive enzyme immunoassays for prostaglandins in the late 1980s.The availability of these assays enabled the development of <b>Celebrex</b> by Searle/Monsanto, relying on measurements of Prostaglandin E2 and Thromboxane B2, and of Singulaire by Merck & Co, relying on measurements of unstable Leukotrienes.|$|E
50|$|Daniel L. Simmons is a {{professor}} of chemistry and former director of the Cancer Research Center at Brigham Young University (BYU).
