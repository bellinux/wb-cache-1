25|$|The major {{characters}} of the first season were divided between those {{on the side of}} the law and those involved in drug-related crime. The starring cast comprised characters from both groups. The investigating detail was launched by the actions of Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West), whose insubordinate tendencies and personal problems overshadowed his ability. The detail was led by Lieutenant Cedric Daniels (Lance Reddick) who faced challenges balancing his career aspirations with his desire to produce a good case. Kima Greggs (Sonja Sohn) was a capable lead detective who faced jealousy from colleagues and worry about the dangers of her job from her domestic partner.

25|$|According to {{a report}} written in 2011 by Vanity Fair {{contributing}} editor David Rose, Afghan Wireless's founder Ehsan Bayat had acted as a <b>confidential</b> <b>informant</b> for the American Federal Bureau of Investigation's Joint Terrorism Task Force since 1998. In a joint endeavor with the National Security Agency known as Operation Foxden, the FBI intended to install equipment into Afghan Wireless's infrastructure that would allow American intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on cell phone calls in Afghanistan. While the operation was in its planning stages, President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 13129, which prohibited US citizens from {{doing business with the}} Taliban. In the interests of completing Operation Foxden, the FBI and NSA aided Bayat and his British partners in circumventing the executive order's ban by transferring ownership of Afghan Wireless to a shell company based in Liechtenstein. Before the plan could be put in place, the American Central Intelligence Agency raised objections to Operation Foxden, citing their traditional preeminence over the FBI in conducting foreign intelligence gathering. The operation was finally authorized to move forward on September 8, 2001—but the September 11 attacks just three days later and the subsequent invasion of Afghanistan rendered the project moot.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast, a number of recurring characters were introduced in the pilot. Teila Tuli (credited as Taylor Wily) was introduced as <b>confidential</b> <b>informant</b> and shave ice entrepreneur Kamekona. Lenkov, who initially designed the character from Huggy Bear on Starsky and Hutch, took a liking to the actor following his audition, and was given the role.

In one of the deleted scenes of the pilot from the first season DVD boxset, an alternate ending featured Hesse swimming ashore after McGarrett shot him. Will Yun Lee was cast as Sang Min. The character was originally a one-off, but because the producers were impressed by Yun Lee's performance, he would appear in a further three episodes in the first season. In February 2010, Taryn Manning was cast as McGarrett's sister, Mary Ann, who was originally intended to appear at her father's funeral. However, her scenes were cut. Mary Ann would later be formally introduced in the fourth episode, [...] "Lanakila".|$|E

500|$|The major {{characters}} of the first season were divided between those {{on the side of}} the law and those involved in drug-related crime.

The detail was led by Lieutenant Cedric Daniels (Lance Reddick) who faced challenges balancing his career aspirations with his desire to produce a good case. Kima Greggs (Sonja Sohn) was a capable lead detective who faced jealousy from colleagues and worry about the dangers of her job from her domestic partner.

Rounding out the temporary unit were detectives Lester Freamon (Clarke Peters) and Roland [...] "Prez" [...] Pryzbylewski (Jim True-Frost). Though not initially important players in the operation, Freamon proved a quietly capable and methodical investigator with a knack for noticing tiny but important details, and Prez turned out to be a natural at following paper trails and his persistence when dealing with seemingly unbreakable codes paid off eventually.|$|E

40|$|Heightened {{pleading}} {{standards and}} limits on discovery in private securities fraud actions make <b>confidential</b> <b>informants</b> crucial in many cases. While courts have widely {{recognized the importance}} of <b>confidential</b> <b>informants</b> and the need to protect them from retaliation, they have not applied consistent standards for how informants must be identified in pleadings, and have failed to take into account substantial bodies of relevant caselaw when deciding whether to require that informants’ names be disclosed in discovery. This article offers a framework for when and how <b>confidential</b> <b>informants</b> should be identified, taking into account the competing interests in anonymity and disclosure. It offers a refined standard for identifying informants at the pleading stage that focuses on how the employee came to have the information pleaded, rather than on the employee’s job title or duties. It also proposes use of in camera review of witness statements. At the discovery stage, this article criticizes the use of the attorney work product doctrine as a basis for protecting informant identities. It argues that courts should perform a balancing analysis that directly weighs public policy and privacy interests in favor of informant anonymity against defendants’ legitimate needs for disclosure. This approach is supported by numerous cases protecting the identities of informants and other types of witnesses under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 (c), and also finds support in the many cases construing the formal privilege applicable to government informants. Finally, this article encourages plaintiffs to seek protective orders for informants early in litigation and briefly discusses protection for witness interview notes...|$|R

Unbeknownst to Anderson or Bobrick, their contact with the private corporations company was a confidential source of the FBI working undercover. According to federal prosecutors, the private corrections company — unidentified in the court documents but widely believed to be Cornell Companies — was not implicated in the plot, and had been unaware of the FBI investigation until Anderson's indictment and arrest. The <b>confidential</b> <b>informant</b> in the case was Frank Prewitt, a former commissioner of the Alaska Department of Corrections who took a job with Cornell Companies after it purchased Allvest. Two of the early private prisons venture partners were caught up in the ongoing Alaska political corruption probe leading to blogger and press speculation that Prewitt's service to the federal government may have been the result of a secret plea agreement although no formal charges were placed. He wore a wire to record conversations in meetings with probe targets. Court documents filed on March 22, 2010 in a criminal appeal indicated that Prewitt had been paid $200,000 for his assistance.

6000|$|... [269] [Barry Edward O'Meara (1786-1836) began life as assistant-surgeon to the 62nd Regiment, then {{stationed}} in Sicily and Calabria. In 1815 he was surgeon {{on board the}} Bellerophon, under Captain F. L. Maitland. Napoleon took a fancy {{to him because he}} could speak Italian, and, as his own surgeon Mengeaud would not follow him into exile, requested that O'Meara might accompany him, in the Northumberland, to St. Helena. His position was an ambiguous one. He was to act as Napoleon's medical and, quoad hoc, confidential attendant, but he was not to be subservient to him or dependent on him. At St. Helena Lowe expected him to be something between an intermediary and a spy, and, for a time, O'Meara discharged both functions to the Governor's satisfaction (statements by Dr. O'Meara are quoted by Lowe in his letter to Lord Bathurst [Life of Napoleon, etc., by Sir W. Scott, 1828, p. 763]). As time went on, the surgeon yielded to the glamour of Napoleon's influence, and more and more disliked and resented the necessity of communicating private conversations to Lowe. He [...] "withheld his confidence," [...] with the result that the Governor became suspicious, and treated O'Meara with reprobation and contempt. At length, on July 18, 1818, on a renewed accusation of [...] "irregularities," [...] Lord Bathurst dismissed him from his post, and ordered him to quit St. Helena. He returned to England, and, October 28, 1818, addressed a letter (see Forsyth's Napoleon, etc., iii. 432, 433) to J. W. Croker, the Secretary to the Admiralty, in which he argued against the justice of his dismissal. One sentence which asserted that Lowe had dwelt upon the [...] "benefit which would result to Europe from the death of Napoleon," [...] was seized upon by Croker as calumnious, and in answer to his remonstrance, O'Meara's name was struck off the list of naval surgeons. He published, in 1819, a work entitled Exposition of some of the Transactions that have taken place at St. Helena since the appointment of Sir Hudson Lowe as Governor, which was afterwards expanded into Napoleon in Exile, or a Voice from St. Helena (2 vols., 1822). The latter work made a great sensation, and passed through five editions. It was republished in 1888. O'Meara was able, and generously disposed, but he was not [...] "stiff" [...] (vide infra, 489). [...] "He was," [...] says Lord Rosebery (Napoleon, The Last Phase, 1900, p. 31), [...] "the confidential servant of Napoleon: unknown to Napoleon, he was the confidential agent of Lowe; and behind both their backs he was the <b>confidential</b> <b>informant</b> of the British Government....
