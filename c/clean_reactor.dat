X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy {{was employed to}} determine the surface characteristics of GaAs treated with HCl, HF, and NH 4 OH solutions preceded by a degreasing procedure. The HCl clean left {{the least amount of}} oxygen on the surface. Fluorine contamination resulting from the CF 4 plasma used to <b>clean</b> the <b>reactor</b> was found to be located at the film-substrate interface by Auger electron spectroscopy with argon-ion sputtering. A modified deposition procedure was developed to eliminate the fluorine contamination. Plasma deposition of silicon nitride encapsulating films was found to modify the I-V characteristics of Schottky diodes subsequently formed on GaAs surface. The reverse current of the diodes was slightly reduced. Substrates implanted with Si at 100 keV and a dose of 5 x 10 to the 12 th/sq cm showed a peak electron concentration of 1. 7 x 10 to the 17 th/cu cm at a depth of 0. 1 -micron with 60 percent activation after encapsulation and annealing at 800 C for 7 min...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe use of {{tailored}} voltage waveforms (TVW's) {{to excite}} a plasma for the deposition of thin films of hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (µc-Si:H) {{has been shown}} to be an effective technique to decouple mean ion bombardment energy (IBE) from injected power. In this work, we examine the changes in material properties controlled by this technique through Raman scattering and spectroscopic ellipsometry for films deposited from H 2 -diluted SiH 4, and we examine the electrical properties of such films using temperature dependent conductivity. As the laboratory-scale deposition system used had neither a load lock nor an oxygen filter in the H 2 line, accidental O-doping was observed for the µc-Si:H films. We investigated suppression of this doping by adding varying amounts of SiF 4, and using an SiF 4 /Ar pre-etch step to <b>clean</b> the <b>reactor.</b> This technique is shown to be effective in decreasing the accidental doping of the films, and intrinsic µc-Si:H films are produced with an activation energy of up to 0. 55 eV.

30|$|The ‘cyclic flow’ reactor is {{designed}} to operate very differently than other PBR designs. In addition to the high energy penalty associated with the continuous circulation of large volumes of algae culture, unintended consequences can arise. Fully developed flow in a pipe results in a ‘no slip’ condition at the pipe wall. This provides convenient conditions for algae cells to accumulate {{on the wall of}} the tube. Given time, these cells will colonize and form a biofilm; indeed, biofilm formation has been a major technical hurdle to the deployment and scale up of photobioreactors. To avoid this issue, the culture in the new reactor does not flow continuously. Instead, the tubes in the photo array drain and fill in a cyclic manner multiple times per day. Consequently, the liquid flow is never fully developed and biofilm formation is minimized. In the cyclic flow PBR, biofilm mitigation is additionally controlled by the introduction of gas bubbles in the PET tubes to create multi-dimensional fluid mixing, and through the use of a buoyant pipe pig (one per PET tube) to <b>clean</b> the <b>reactor</b> walls as flow is cycled. Each time the reactor is filled and drained the pipe pigs—which are equipped with rubber gaskets—travel the length of the clear PET tubes, mechanically removing any attached algae (confirmed by visual inspection).|$|R

The treatment considered here is one in which waste would be chemically separated so that long-lived radionuclides can be treated using specific processes appropriate for the nuclide. The technical feasibility of enhancing repository performance by this type of treatment is considered in this report. A joint Westinghouse Hanford-PNL study group developed a concept called the <b>Clean</b> Use of <b>Reactor</b> Energy (CURE), and evaluated the potential of current technology to reduce the long-lived radionuclide content in waste from the nuclear power industry. The CURE process consists of three components: chemical separation of elements that have significant quantities of long-lived radioisotopes in the waste, exposure in a neutron flux to transmute the radioisotopes to stable nuclides, and packaging of radionuclides that cannot be transmuted easily for storage or geologic disposal. 76 refs., 32 figs., 24 tabs...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{membrane}} reactor {{was designed for}} the ozonolysis of refractory organic pollutants in water. The reactor employed a membrane contactor and a membrane separator in a concentric arrangement to affect a uniform ozone distribution along the reactor length, while allowing the simultaneous membrane separation and production of clean water. An alumina capillary membrane contactor and a ZSM- 5 zeolite pervaporation membrane were used in this study. Using potassium hydrogen phthalate as model pollutant, {{the performance of the}} novel {{membrane reactor}} was tested and compared to ozone reaction carried out using the capillary membrane contactor and membrane pervaporation using the ZSM- 5 membrane. The novel membrane reactor consistently outperformed both membrane processes. Forty-seven percent higher TOC degradation was observed compared to ozone reaction using a capillary membrane contactor. This enhancement is due to the increase in the organic pollutant concentration in the reaction zone as a result of water withdrawal by membrane pervaporation.

The experiments were carried out with the <b>reactor</b> <b>clean</b> (without biomass) and containing denitrifying biofilm (Alcaligenes denitrificans) covering the disks. Residence Time Distribution (RTD) experiments were performed by the stimulus-response technique using lithium chloride as tracer. Experiments without biomass revealed the existence of hydraulic dead volumes (around 40 % for hydraulic residence time of 0. 94 and 2 hours) that occur in corners, where stagnant eddies form. When in normal operation, with the disks covered by biofilm and with biogas production, these values decreased significantly. For hydraulic residence time (HRT) of 2 hours a minimum dead volume was observed, being appropriate to run the reactor under this condition, from the hydraulic viewpoint. The Dispersion number decreased with increasing HRT from 0. 94 h on, for both types of experiment, without, and {{in the presence of}} biomass. For this HRT the dispersion number was maximal in both situations.

The design {{is based on}} the Princeton Field-Reversed Configuration Reactor (PFRC) concept for a compact, <b>clean,</b> steady-state fusion <b>reactor</b> for power levels between 1 and 10 MW. Larger power levels can be accommodated using multiple engines. This technology enables missions such as human Mars orbiters, nuclear fusion powered space stations and high power robotic missions to the outer planets. This paper reviews the theory behind the design of compact and clean (aneutronic) fusion-powered rocket engines. The reactor employs a field-reversed magnetic field configuration (FRC) for plasma confinement, a novel radio-frequency (RF) method for plasma heating, and a unique method for control of propellant flow, producing a thrust of 30 N at a specific impulse of 2 × 10 4 s. The FRC has higher β (plasma pressure/magnetic energy density) than other magnetic plasma-confinement devices and a relatively simple linear solenoid magnet layout that permits control of propellant flow parameters. Higher β reduces the mass of the superconducting solenoidal coils needed for achieving the higher plasma temperatures required for aneutronic fusion reactions. Waste heat generated from the plasma’s bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation can be recycled to power the RF heating and other on-board systems. The unique characteristics of this reactor –with non-equilibrium plasma conditions –will produce five-fold lower levels of neutrons than from equilibrium conditions.

40|$|Only {{abstract}} of poster available. Track II: Transportation and BiofuelsGeneration {{of liquid}} fuels from renewable {{sources such as}} biomass has been practiced since early 1900 's. In view of the skyrocketing oil prices and the depleting reserves of natural gas, it has gained further interest. The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis {{is one of the}} main processes considered. It involves the reaction of syngas in presence of a catalyst to produce liquid fuels. Syngas sources are numerous ranging from waste gasification, anaerobic digestion to <b>clean</b> coal. The <b>reactor</b> of choice for gas to liquid conversion is a slurry bubble column. Although, these multiphase reactors offer several advantages including good heat and mass transfer, ease of construction and operation, the absence of moving parts, one of their main disadvantages is the difficulties associated with the scale-up. The latter is due to complex phases' interactions and significant backmixing of phases. In general, the scaling rules are derived from mass and momentum balances resulting in dimensionless hydrodynamic numbers. For a proper scaling these numbers should be kept constant, together with dimensionless geometric numbers in order to ensure both dynamic and geometrical similarity. With the complex nature of the flow in these systems, this becomes very hard to achieve since it may result in the need for matching a large numbers of dimensionless quantities. Hence, different routes to provide a firm scale-up methodology are needed. Controlling the effect of scale using heat exchanging internals by means of reactor compartmentalization is proposed in this study. The details of this methodology can be summarized as follows: •	The large reactor diameter is subdivided into similar, vertical compartments by means of the cooling tubes. •	The compartments are to have a diameter similar to that of a small scale column on which investigations can be (have been) performed. •	The various hydrodynamic parameters within each compartment are to be compared with those measured in a bubble column of the same diameter. Preliminary results show that radial gas holdup profiles inside the compartments exhibited similar behavior as inside a solid wall column, with a close agreement between resulting gas holdup profile inside the single tube bundle compartment and data obtained in 6 inches steel bubble column...|$|R

Clouds influence climate and cool the planet by reflecting incoming sunlight away from Earth’s surface. The extent and brightness of these clouds {{depend on the}} composition and concentration of atmospheric particles, {{the starting point for}} cloud droplet formation. The majority of atmospheric particles originate from a process known as nucleation, whereby low volatility, gaseous precursors react to form stable clusters (~ 1 nm diameter). Sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 or SA) is essential for atmospheric nucleation and in continental regions originates primarily from anthropogenic activities. However, atmospheric nucleation remains difficult to study due to the challenges of measuring incipient particles < 1 nm (cluster containing ~< 4 SA molecules plus water and other stabilizing compounds) and at atmospherically relevant concentrations of 1 part per quadrillion. The purpose of my thesis work is (1) to better understand the technique of chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) for measuring SA and its clusters and (2) to measure and model how various atmospherically relevant basic gases, such as ammonia and amines, affect SA nucleation. The main instrument, the Cluster CIMS, uses nitrate (NO 3 -) to chemically ionize SA vapor and clusters at atmospheric pressure. My measurements and subsequent modeling of the chemical ionization processes show that nitrate is unable to ionize chemically neutral SA clusters, i. e. clusters that contain near equal numbers of acid and base molecules. In contrast, the acetate ion (CH 3 CO 2 ¬-) is capable of ionizing more cluster types, thereby providing more accurate measurements of cluster concentrations. These findings imply that a large fraction of clusters may have gone unobserved in ambient measurements due to inefficient nitrate chemical ionization. To ensure that the Cluster CIMS accurately measures concentrations of larger SA clusters using acetate chemical ionization, I developed a method for comparing cluster concentrations measured by mass spectrometry with particle number concentrations measured by mobility classification/vapor condensation particle counter in the size range around 1 nm where they overlap. I used computational chemistry, particle dynamics, and the diffusing transfer function of a mobility classifier to reconcile these two very different measurement techniques. Comparisons show good agreement between the instruments for ~ 1 nm clusters produced in a sulfuric acid/dimethylamine (DMA) environment. The Cluster CIMS and a diethylene glycol scanning mobility particle sizer were also used to study how ammonia and amines react with SA vapor to form clusters and particles in a very <b>clean</b> flow <b>reactor.</b> Results show that DMA and diamines produce higher cluster and particle concentrations than methylamine and ammonia, which implies that they form less volatile clusters leading to higher nucleation rates. Diamines, including compounds such as cadaverine and putrescine, are a previously unstudied class of atmospherically relevant compounds that originate from industrial and natural sources. I observed that diamines+SA can produce 10 times more particles than DMA. Field measurements of diamines in Lamont, OK from spring, 2013 show gas phase diamine concentrations are equal to or greater than DMA concentrations. Thus, diamines are potent nucleating agents that likely contribute significantly to atmospheric nucleation. Overall, my thesis work improved nucleation instrumentation and increased knowledge on the chemical mechanisms behind atmospheric nucleation...|$|R

40|$|True {{biological}} aerated filters (BAFs) combine two unit {{operations in}} one reactor: {{aerobic biological treatment}} and subsequent biomass separation from the effluent (Stephenson et al., 1993). The submerged media used as support for the microbial biofilms are usually granular in nature and are therefore able to also act as depth filtration media. Therefore BAFs should provide a small footprint alternative to traditional aerobic processes. Indeed, Dillon and Thomas (1990) noted that a "good quality effluent" was possible up to a loading of 4. 1 kgBOD/m 3 /d (9. 1 kgCOD/m 3 /d); with an automated backwash programme influent BOD 5 was reduced by between 90. 3 % and 97. 6 %. Pujol et al. (1992) found an effluent standard of 90 mgCOD/I difficult to achieve for loading rates above 6. 0 kgCOD/m 3 /d. Stensel et al., 1988) achieved 88 % removal of ammonia at a loading rate of 1. 6 kgBOD/m 3 /d and modern BAFs can achieve simultaneous carbonaceous BOD and ammonia removal at loading rates of 2. 5 kgBOD/m 3 /d (Rogalla and Payraudeau, 1987). Despite the impressive loadings rates possible, BAFs require large volumes of water for backwashing {{on a regular basis}} to prevent blockage of the media. Therefore these processes require large volume tanks to hold effluent for backwashing and mudwells for collection of the backwash water. In addition, large pumps and pipework systems are needed to achieve the required backwash flowrates. In depth filters, this problem can be overcome by using continuous filtration systems, e. g. Dynasand (Kramer and Wouters, 1993). These incorporate a media recycle and wash system which allows uninterrupted treatment to occur. In Dynasand, the liquid flow is upwards and the media flow downward. The sand is removed {{from the base of the}} <b>reactors,</b> <b>cleaned</b> and then transported to the top of the bed. Thus the water exiting the filter always see a clean polishing layer of sand. The sand is removed by means of an airlift pump at the base of the reactor. Moving bed systems have been tested on sewage as an alternative to sedimentation (Mixon, 1973). It is possible that the advantages of the moving bed principle could be combined with BAF technology to reduce or eliminate the need for expensive backwashing facilities. Such a system would not be the same as moving bed biofilm reactors described by Rusten (1984) and Hem et al. (1994) which require separate secondary sedimentation tanks. The current paper reports on an investigation into operating a plastic media BAF with media recirculation in order to eliminate backwashing...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogenated nitrile {{butadiene}} rubber (HNBR) {{which is known}} for its excellent elastomeric properties and mechanical retention properties after long time exposure to heat, oil and air is produced by the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrile {{butadiene rubber}} (NBR). Hydrogenation of NBR is carried out preferably in solution via homogeneous catalysis. As yet, it is being commercially produced in a semi-batch process where gaseous hydrogen continuously flows into a batch of reactant polymer. Several catalysts have been exploited successfully for the hydrogenation of NBR in organic solvents, which include palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium complexes. Owing to the drawbacks of batch production (such as time taken for charging and discharging the reactants/products, heating and cooling, <b>reactor</b> <b>clean</b> up), and the huge demand for HNBR, a continuous process is proposed where potential time saving is possible in addition to the high turn over of the product. Numerical investigation of the HNBR production in a plug flow reactor and a continuous stirred tank reactor showed that a reactor with plug flow behavior would be economical and efficient. A static mixer (SM) reactor with open-curve blade internal geometry is designed based on the simulation and hydrodynamic results. The SM reactor was designed with 24 mixing elements, 3. 81 cm ID and 90 cm length. The reactor has a jacket in which steam is used to heat the polymer solution. The hydrodynamics in the SM reactor (open-flat blade structure) with air-water system showed that plug flow could be achieved even under laminar flow conditions (Reh < 20). For a constant mean residence time, the Peclet number was varying such that it is 4. 7 times the number of mixing elements (ne) used in the SM reactor. Empirical correlations were developed for gas hold up (εG) and overall mass transfer coefficient (KLa). The mass transfer experiments showed that high KLa, 4 to 6 times compared to that of the conventional reactors could be achieved in the SM reactor at particular operating conditions. Very important information on the Peclet number, liquid hold were obtained from the hydrodynamic experiments conducted with the actual working fluids (hydrogen, polymer solutions) in the SM reactor. The superficial gas velocity had an adverse effect on both Peclet number and liquid hold up. The viscosity of the polymer solution also had a marginal negative effect on the Peclet number while a positive effect on the liquid hold up. The hydrogenation performance with the homogeneous catalyst OsHCl(CO) (O 2) (PCy 3) 2 was performed in the continuous process with SM reactor. Complete hydrogenation of NBR was possible in a single pass. The effect of mean residence time, catalyst and polymer concentration on the final degree of hydrogenation was studied. The minimum catalyst required to achieve degree of hydrogenation over 97 % was empirically found and an empirical correlation was developed for degree of hydrogenation as a function of operating conditions and parameters. Hydrogenation in the SM reactor is modeled by using plug flow with axial dispersion model that is coupled with the concentrations of carbon-carbon double bond, hydrogen and osmium catalyst. The model involves coupled, non-linear partial differential equations with different dimensionless parameters. The proposed model was verified with the experimental results obtained from the hydrogenation and hydrodynamic experiments. The model could satisfactorily predict the degree of hydrogenation obtained from experimental results at various operating conditions. In general, the designed continuous process with SM reactor performed well and was an effective method of manufacturing HNBR on a continuous basis. The designed system is amicable to the industrial operating conditions and promises to be highly efficient and economic process for production of HNBR...|$|R
