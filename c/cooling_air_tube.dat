Such a design, even in closed loop mode, could draw a quantity of fresh air when an air pressure drop is created by a solar chimney, clothes dryer, fireplace, kitchen or bathroom exhaust vents. It is better to draw in filtered passive <b>cooling</b> <b>tube</b> <b>air</b> than unconditioned outside air.|$|R
50|$|Some {{consider}} {{that it is}} more efficient to pull air through a long tube than to push it with a fan. A solar chimney can use natural convection (warm air rising) to create a vacuum to draw filtered passive <b>cooling</b> <b>tube</b> <b>air</b> through the largest diameter cooling tubes. Natural convection may be slower than using a solar-powered fan. Sharp 90-degree angles should be avoided {{in the construction of the}} tube - two 45-degree bends produce less-turbulent, more efficient air flow. While smooth-wall tubes are more efficient in moving the air, they are less efficient in transferring energy.|$|R

[...] He also embarked on a venture to fit cars with air conditioning equipment, putting the machinery in the trunk and piping the <b>cooled</b> <b>air</b> through <b>tubes</b> in the headliner. This caught the interest of engineers from General Motors, who copied the system in Cadillacs in the late 1940s. [...] "After market" [...] automotive AC units were manufactured in Texas until the 1980s. He also sold some of the first air conditioning units, built by the Curtis Mathes Corporation, an early leader in manufacturing window units. [...] Northrup married Jane Keliher and started a family in Dallas, where he designed and built one of the first single-family houses in the United States with central air conditioning. He founded a company to install air conditioning in residential and commercial buildings. With a Marketing Plan from G F Sweetman (CEO of American Awards Co), he became one of largest suppliers of Curtis Mathes fans and compressors in the nation. He also developed a company to manage, install, update, and clean air filtration systems.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{numerical}} modeling {{was used to}} study the local behavior of flow and energy variables to understand the underlying physics in a Finned Tube Cooler. The cooler under consideration is a single circular-fin <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> <b>tube</b> confined in a duct. The optimizations of fin pitch and fin clearance as predicted by Rangan et al. (2003) have been elucidated based on the underlying physical principles involved. The model was further applied to study the augmentation of heat transfer and suppression of pumping power due to symmetric radial slits on the fin surface. Reversal of heat transfer direction {{is seen in the}} wake of the tube in the case of an unserrated fin. Radial slits reduce this region by aiding mixing of the flow. The heat transfer performance of the fin is enhanced by 5 % by placing symmetric radial slits at the onset of flow separation in comparison against an unserrated heat exchanger. But the pumping power requirements also increase at a similar rate...|$|R

40|$|High {{pressure}} {{turbine nozzle}} guide vane of a gas turbine engine, which operates at gas temperatures in excess of 1700 K, employs various cooling techniques to keep the vane within safe operating limits. Even though {{nozzle guide vane}}s are designed using heat transfer co-relations available in published papers and fundamental data, it is required to test the nozzle guide vane to ascertain the surface metal temperature and verify the adequacy of cooling. Adequacy of cooling is quantified by the term cooling effectiveness expressed and as percentage. Cooling effectiveness {{is a function of}} gas temperature, <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature and surface metal temperature. The objective of the current work was to study the effect of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature on <b>cooling</b> effectiveness. Tests were conducted on a high pressure turbine nozzle guide vane. Gas pressure, gas temperature, <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> pressure was kept constant and the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature was varied as a ratio of gas temperature to <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature and its effect on metal temperature studied.

25|$|The liner {{contains}} the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and <b>cooling,</b> see <b>Air</b> flow paths below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be <b>cooled</b> with <b>air</b> flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> required. Transpiration <b>cooling</b> results in a much more even temperature profile, as the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> is uniformly introduced through pores. Film <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film <b>cooling).</b> Using less <b>air</b> for <b>cooling</b> allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|R
