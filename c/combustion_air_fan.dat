40|$|The act of {{condition}} monitoring {{has actually been}} practiced by plant engineers for generating or estimating, how long {{a part of the}} equipment can continue in service until it needs to be shut down for repair using traditional touch, see and hear methods. The applications of computers, electronic measuring and detecting systems have provided a new approach to {{condition monitoring}}. The analysis of the information provided by the sensor output is done by using established techniques and interpretation of evaluated output, is then used to establish what actions are to be taken. The use of vibration signals is quite common in the field of condition monitoring of rotating machinery. In this paper, an attempt has been made to monitor the condition of a <b>combustion</b> <b>air</b> <b>fan</b> located at Wire Rod Mill Department in Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, India. The fan unit is supported by four Plummer blocks, two at motor end and the other two at fan end.

50|$|Each {{unit had}} two large Forced Draught (FD) Fans. For {{efficiency}} these <b>fans</b> drew warm <b>air</b> from an intake {{at the top}} of the station. This <b>combustion</b> <b>air</b> was passed through the Air Heater which increased its temperature. Dampers were used to control the quantity of air admitted to the furnace and direct some of the air to the Primary Air (PA) Fans.There were also two large Induced <b>Air</b> (ID) <b>Fans</b> on each unit. These drew the hot gases from the Boiler, through the Air Heater where the heat is transferred to the incoming <b>combustion</b> <b>air.</b> The gases were then exhausted up the chimney. The exhaust flow of these fans was also controlled by dampers in the ducting.Working in tandem the Draught plant ensured the boiler was always under a slight vacuum. This created a draw of <b>combustion</b> <b>air</b> into the boiler and an exhaust to the chimney. The exhaust gases could not be allowed to cool below a certain temperature, as there was a risk of the sulfur and nitrogen oxides in the flue gases condensing and forming acids which could have damaged the ID Fans.|$|R

The {{performances}} of centrifugal <b>fans,</b> two primary <b>air</b> <b>fans</b> and two secondary <b>air</b> <b>fans</b> {{were tested in}} BECR load and were compared with design parameters.
