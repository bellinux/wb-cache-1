40|$|The Dolev-Yao {{model is}} a useful and {{well-known}} framework in which to analyze security protocols. However, it models the messages of the protocol {{at a very high}} level and makes extremely strong assumptions about the power of the adversary. The computational model of cryptography, on the other hand, takes a much lower-level view of messages and uses much weaker assumptions. Despite the large differences between these two models, {{we have been able to}} show that there exists a relationship between them. Previous results of ours demonstrate that certain kinds of <b>computational</b> <b>cryptography</b> can result in an equivalence of sorts between the formal and computational adversary. Specifically: 1. We gave an interpretation to the messages of the Dolev [...] Yao model in terms of <b>computational</b> <b>cryptography,</b> 2. We defined a computational security condition, called weak Dolev-Yao non-malleability, that translates the main assumptions of the Dolev-Yao model into the computational setting, and 3. We demonstrated that this condition is satisfied by a standard definition of computational encryption security called plaintext awareness. In this work, we consider this result and strengthen it in four ways: Firstly, we propose a stronger definition of Dolev-Yao non-malleability which ensures security against a more adaptive adversary. Secondly, the definition of plaintext awareness is considered suspect because it relies on a trusted third party called the random oracle. Thus, we show that our new notion of Dolev-Yao non-malleability is satisfied by a weaker and less troublesome definition for computational encryption called chosen-ciphertext security. Thirdly, we propose a new definition of plaintext-awareness that does not use random oracles, and an implementation. This implementation is conceptually simple, and relies only on general assumptions. Specifically, it can be thought of as a `self-referential' variation on a well-known encryption scheme. Lastly, we show how the computational soundness of the Dolev-Yao model can be maintained even as it is extended to include new operators.

40|$|A non-malleable code protects {{messages}} against various {{classes of}} tampering. Informally, a code is non-malleable if the message {{contained in a}} tampered codeword is either the original message, or a completely unrelated one. Although existence of such codes for various rich classes of tampering functions is known, explicit constructions exist only for “compartmentalized” tampering functions: i. e. the codeword is partitioned into a priori fixed blocks and each block can only be tampered independently. The prominent examples of this model are the family of bit-wise independent tampering functions and the split-state model. In this paper, {{for the first time}} we construct explicit non-malleable codes against a natural class of non-compartmentalized tampering functions. We allow the tampering functions to permute the bits of the codeword and (optionally) perturb them by flipping or setting them to 0 or 1.

We provide a generic approach to decide general security properties by showing that any constraint system can be transformed in (possibly several) much simpler constraint systems that are called solved forms. As a consequence, we prove that deciding the existence of key cycles is NPcomplete for a bounded number of sessions.
