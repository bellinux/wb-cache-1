5|$|The {{publicity}} from Sanger's trial generated immense {{enthusiasm for}} the cause, {{and by the end}} of 1917 there were over 30 birth control organizations in the United States.Engelman, p. 92. Sanger was always astute about public relations, and she seized on the publicity of the trial to advance her causes.Kennedy pp. 84, 181.Engelman, pp. 92–93. In her memoirs, Sanger often understated or entirely omitted the contributions of fellow activists. After her trial, she emerged as the movement's most visible leader. Other leaders, such as William J. Robinson, Mary Dennett, and Blanche Ames Ames, could not match Sanger's charisma, <b>charm</b> <b>and</b> fervor.|$|E

5|$|The tale {{was well}} {{received}} by the Scotsman, but The Times Literary Supplement was not entirely enthusiastic:Among the little books that have become as much a manifestation of autumn as falling leaves, one looks first for whatever Miss Beatrix Potter gives...

5|$|When {{casting the}} many {{characters}} of Pride and Prejudice, the producer Sue Birtwistle and director Simon Langton {{were looking for}} actors with wit, <b>charm</b> <b>and</b> charisma, who could also play the Regency period.

Hundreds of actresses between 15 and 28 auditioned, and those with the right presence were screen-tested, performing several prepared scenes in period costumes and makeup in a television studio. Straight offers were made to several established actors.|$|E

5|$|White's Natural History {{was at once}} well {{received}} by contemporary critics and the public, and continued to be admired by a diverse range of nineteenth and twentieth century literary figures including Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas Carlyle, Charles Darwin, John Ruskin, Virginia Woolf, and W.

The book has been enjoyed for its <b>charm</b> <b>and</b> apparent simplicity, and the way that it creates a vision of pre-industrial England.|$|E

He {{was admitted to the}} New Hampshire bar in late 1827 and began to practice in Hillsborough. Pierce lost his first case, but soon proved capable as a lawyer. Despite never being a legal scholar, his memory for names and faces served him well, as did his personal <b>charm</b> <b>and</b> deep voice. In Hillsborough, his law partner was Albert Baker, who had studied law under Pierce and was the brother of Mary Baker Eddy.|$|E
5|$|Cardus's {{approach}} to cricket writing was innovative, turning what {{had previously been}} largely a factual form into vivid description and criticism; he is considered by contemporaries to have influenced every subsequent cricket writer. Although he achieved his largest readership for his cricket reports and books, he considered music criticism as his principal vocation. Without any formal musical training, he was initially influenced by the older generation of critics, in particular Samuel Langford and Ernest Newman, but developed his own individual style of criticism—subjective, romantic and personal, {{in contrast to the}} objective analysis practised by Newman. Cardus's opinions and judgments were often forthright and unsparing, which sometimes caused friction with leading performers. Nevertheless, his personal <b>charm</b> <b>and</b> gregarious manner enabled him to form lasting friendships in the cricketing and musical worlds, with among others Newman, Sir Thomas Beecham and Sir Donald Bradman.|$|E

5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. The {{left side of}} the wheel is normally reserved for options that will continue the conversation in depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard and affect the player's chosen morality. Morality is measured by Paragon (<b>charm)</b> <b>and</b> Renegade (intimidate) points. These points allow the player to develop talents that affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game.|$|E
5|$|In The Greek Myths (1955), Robert Graves views Oenopion as his {{perennial}} Year-King, at {{the stage}} where the king pretends to die {{at the end of}} his term and appoints a substitute, in this case Orion, who actually dies in his place. His blindness is iconotropy from a picture of Odysseus blinding the Cyclops, mixed with a purely Hellenic solar legend: the Sun-hero is captured and blinded by his enemies at dusk, but escapes and regains his sight at dawn, when all beasts flee him. Graves sees the rest of the myth as a syncretism of diverse stories. These include Gilgamesh and the Scorpion-Men, Set becoming a scorpion to kill Horus and the story of Aqhat and Yatpan from Ras Shamra, as well as a conjectural story of how the priestesses of Artemis Opis killed a visitor to their island of Ortygia. He compares Orion's birth from the bull's hide to a West African rainmaking <b>charm</b> <b>and</b> claims that the son of Poseidon should be a rainmaker.|$|E

In March 2010, Lewis was seen advertising his services in The Lady, {{as part of a}} crossover between the society magazine and Coronation Street. Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) sees the advert and books Lewis for a date, forming a love triangle storyline between them and Audrey.

5|$|Lewis' {{presence}} on the Street infuriates Gail, who still holds a grudge {{for the way he}} treated Audrey. Gail hopes Lewis may have left for good when he attends court on charges of fraud. However, Lewis charms the judge with a speech about the way he let Audrey down, and he is sentenced to community service. The animosity between Gail and Lewis, reaches a peak at The Bisto; and as Audrey defends Lewis, a food critic from the Weatherfield Gazette walks in. A show spokesperson told Inside Soap's Katy Moon that Lewis turns on the <b>charm</b> <b>and</b> quickly wins the reviewer over. Audrey's grandson Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), who owns The Bistro, realises Lewis' communication skills could be good for his business and he employs Lewis for a trial period at the restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Morality is {{measured}} by Paragon (<b>charm)</b> <b>and</b> Renegade (intimidate) points. These points affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game. For example, the game features some missions to gain the loyalty of the squad. What the player does during one of these missions will determine whether they gain the loyalty of a squad member, which in turn will unlock a special power and also help in the final battle. Endings range from the entire team surviving to the entire team being killed, Shepard included, and everything in between. Upon completing the game, a New Game Plus option is unlocked, allowing players to replay the game using the same character with which they finished it.|$|E
5|$|Sarah's frankness and {{indifference}} for rank, so admired by Anne earlier in their friendship, was now {{seen to be}} intrusive. Unlike most women of the time—many of whom did not have influence with their own husbands—Sarah had a powerful intimacy with the two most powerful men in the country, Marlborough and Godolphin. Godolphin, though a great friend of Sarah's, had even considered refusing high office after Anne's accession, preferring to live quietly {{and away from the}} political side of Sarah, who was bossy, interfering, and presumed to tell him what to do when Marlborough was away. Sarah, although a woman in a man's world of national and international politics, was always ready to give her advice; express her opinions; antagonize with outspoken censure; and insist on having her say on every possible occasion. However, she had a <b>charm</b> <b>and</b> vivaciousness which was admired by many; and she could easily delight those she met with her wit.|$|E
