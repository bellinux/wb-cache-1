5000|$|As {{with other}} traction-type CVTs, {{transmission}} of torque through the NuVinci CVT involves some relative sliding between the torque-transmitting contact patches. This is because, {{for any given}} contact patch, parts of the ball are going {{in a slightly different}} direction and at slightly different speeds than the disc (this phenomenon of traction-type CVTs is referred to as [...] "contact spin"). [...] "The spin velocity (or drill speed) is defined as the difference in the rotational speed of the driving and driven rollers in a direction perpendicular to the contact patch plane. It is caused by the relative difference in surface speeds of both elements across the contact patch and is a major source of power loss in traction drive CVT’s." [...] In all traction-type CVTs, this relative sliding necessarily occurs between surfaces which are under the very high clamping pressures required to ensure torques are transmitted reliably. This relative sliding under high pressures cause transmission losses (inefficiency). Fallbrook Technology refuse to publish any efficiency data for the NuVinci CVT. However, The NuVinci is a variant on the [...] "Tilting-ball drive" [...] type of continuously variable transmission (CVT), and the efficiency of [...] "Tilting-ball drive" [...] type CVTs is typically in the range of 70% to 89%. However, its geometry does differ significantly from the Kopp type of tilting ball variator in the reference in that the NuVinci has its torque transfer contacts on the outside diameter rather than the inside diameter, which puts the idler (an element that reacts <b>clamping</b> <b>load)</b> in compression rather than tension, and because the idler contact surface is not conformal as in the Kopp design. In general {{because of the way the}} CVT is set up, it is more efficient at a 1:1 ratio compared to maximum overdrive or underdrive positions. Independent test results have shown that at 1:1 it is actually more efficient than comparable bicycle internal gear hubs, while at the ratio extremes it is slightly lower.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this study is, by using finite element analysis (FEA), to characterize the effects of <b>clamping</b> <b>load</b> on the thermal stress distribution in a prototypical planar solid oxide fuel cell (pSOFC) stack with compliant mica-based seal gaskets. A three-dimensional (3 -D) FEA model was constructed for a multiple-cell stack to perform comprehensive thermal stress analyses at steady operation and shutdown stages. The constructed 3 -D FEA model consists of complete components in a practical pSOFC stack, including positive electrode-electrolyte-negative electrode (PEN) assembly, interconnect, nickel mesh, glass-ceramic seals, and compressive mica seals. Five different compressive loads (0. 06, 0. 1, 0. 6, 1, and 6 MPa) were applied in the modeling to clamp the given integrated pSOFC stack. Simulation results indicate that increasing the applied <b>clamping</b> <b>load</b> from 0. 06 to 0. 6 MPa could eliminate bending deformation in the PEN plate and its supporting frame.

The <b>clamp</b> <b>load</b> consistency concern is founded {{in the fact that}} a portion of the input torque used to create <b>clamp</b> <b>load</b> is also used to create threads. The torque used for thread forming may not be consistent due to variations in casting material, hole size and shape due to tooling wear and process variation (thermal and mechanical). There is little data available to understand the magnitude of this concern or to form the basis of potential solutions if the range of <b>clamp</b> <b>load</b> variation is very high (> +/- 30 %). The range of variation that can be expected in as-cast hole size and shape over the full life cycle of a high pressure die casting die was established in previous work completed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, (PNNL).

There were two sets of experiments run. First, a series of cast aluminum nuts were made reflecting the range of shape and size variations to be expected over the life cycle of a die casting die. Taptite thread forming fasteners, (a widely used thread forming fastener suitable for aluminum applications), were driven into the various cored, as-cast nuts at a constant input torque and resulting <b>clamp</b> <b>loads</b> were recorded continuously. The <b>clamp</b> <b>load</b> data was used to determine the range of <b>clamp</b> <b>loads</b> to be expected. The bolts were driven to failure. The <b>clamp</b> <b>load</b> corresponding to the target input of 18. 5 Nm was recorded for each fastener. In a like fashion, a second set of experiments were run with cast magnesium nuts and ALtracs thread forming fasteners, (a widely used thread forming fastener suitable for magnesium applications). Again all <b>clamp</b> <b>loads</b> were recorded and analyzed similarly to the Taptites in aluminum cast nuts. Results from previous work performed on the same test cell for a Battelle project using standard M 8 bolts into standard M 8 nuts were included as a comparator for a standard bolt and nut application. The results for the thread forming fasteners in aluminum cast holes were well within industry expectations of +/- 30 % for out of the box and robustness range testing. The results for the dry and lubed extreme conditions were only slightly higher than industry expectations at +/- 35. 6 %. However, when compared to the actual Battelle results (+/- 40 %) for a standard bolt and nut the tread forming fasteners performed slightly better. The results for the thread forming fasteners in magnesium cast holes were all well within industry expectations of +/- 30 % for all three conditions. The robustness range (. 05 mm larger and smaller holes than the expected wear pattern of a die casting die at full life cycle) results also fell within the industry expectations for standard threaded fasteners. These results were very encouraging. It was concluded that this work showed that <b>clamp</b> <b>load</b> variation with thread forming fasteners is consistent with industry expectations for standard steel bolts and nuts at +/- 30 %. There does not appear to be any significant increase in <b>clamp</b> <b>load</b> variation due to the application of thread forming fasteners in as-cast holes of aluminum or magnesium over the effective life of a die casting mold. The fully implemented potential benefit of thread forming fasteners in as-cast holes of aluminum and magnesium is estimated to be 6 trillion Btu per year for North America.

The handrail clamp uses a stack of disk springs to provide a spring loaded button. This configuration provides consistent clamping force over a range of possible handrail thicknesses.

Calculation of the basic design parameters of work based on their functioning features is fairly relevant. In pallet transfer movement over work positioning there is a mismatch between axes of the basic bushing of a pallet and the clamping locks of positioning. The paper identifies the factors influencing it, and defines the conditions to ensure the trouble-free clamping lock. The circular and rhombic clamping of pallet is simultaneous. Further, a <b>clamping</b> <b>load</b> is calculated from the pallet mass (together with the work-piece) and the geometric parameters of the pallet clamping. The paper reveals three movement stages of the clamping lock in a vertical plane when setting the pallet in work positioning: - a clamping lock free play till it encounters with the location bushing; - a clamping lock play length when the lead-in chamfer contacts the bushing chamfer; - a clamping lock play length over the circular surface of bushing. The study of this process has allowed us to calculate the time of pallet clamping and dynamic loads acting on the clamping lock. These calculations made it possible to calculate the required diameter of the clamping lock. The presented calculations allow a reasonable assigning the main design parameters of work positioning for the pallet automatic lines. </p...|$|E
50|$|Processivity {{refers to}} both speed and {{continuity}} of DNA replication, and high processivity {{is a requirement}} for timely replication. High processivity is in part ensured by ring-shaped proteins referred to as 'clamps' that help replicative polymerases stay associated with the leading and lagging strands. There are other variables as well: from a chemical perspective, strand binding proteins stimulate polymerisation and provide extra thermodynamic energy for the reaction. From a systems perspective, the structure and chemistry of many replisome factors (such as the AAA+ ATPase features of the individual <b>clamp</b> <b>loading</b> sub-units, along with the helical conformation they adopt), and the associations between <b>clamp</b> <b>loading</b> factors and other accessory factors, also increases processivity.|$|R

Even if the part is positioned correctly, the external machining forces and <b>clamping</b> <b>load</b> cause the part to deviate from its position. This deviation depends on the external load and the ﬁxture stiﬀness. In this article, a comprehensive analytical model of a 3 - 2 - 1 ﬁxturing system is proposed, consisting of a kinematic and a mechanical part. The kinematic model relocates the initially misplaced workpiece in the machine reference through the axial advancements of six locators taking all the ﬁxturing elements to be rigid. The repositioned part then shifts again from the corrected position due to the deformation of ﬁxturing elements under clamping and machining forces. The mechanical model calculates this displacement of the part considering the locators and clamps to be elastic. The rigid cuboid baseplate, used to precisely re-locate the workpiece, is also considered elastic at the interface with the locators. Using small displacement hypothesis with zero friction at the contact points, Lagrangian formulation enables us to calculate the rigid body displacement of the workpiece, deformation of each locator, {{as well as the}} stiﬀness matrix and mechanical behavior of the ﬁxturing system.

40|$|PURPOSE: It was {{the aim of}} {{this study}} to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of a luting technique that is said to compensate for misfits of implant-supported prostheses by means of a combined screw retained-luted fixation of the prostheses to the supporting abutments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One three-unit prosthesis was made on cylindric abutments, and one was made on conical abutments. Two more prostheses were made, one on the cylindric and one on the conical abutments, with the luting system. The preload was measured in different fit and misfit situations, with and without the use of the luting system. The preload is a combination of internal preload (positive axial forces), which is a <b>clamping</b> <b>load</b> that keeps the implant-prosthesis components together, and external preload (axial forces and bending moments), which {{is the result of a}} deformation of the implant-prosthesis complex during fixation caused by prosthesis misfit. The external preload on the supporting abutments after screw tightening the prostheses was used as an indicator for the quality of fit of the prostheses. RESULTS: The axial forces were lower and the bending moments were higher in cases of misfit in comparison with the optimal fit situation. The luting system generally did not decrease the registered external preload. Except for one test condition, even higher bending moments were registered on the supporting abutments when the luting system was used. CONCLUSION: For the prostheses evaluated in this study, the luting system was not effective in reducing the external preload on the supporting implants caused by prosthesis misfit. Although the luting system could compensate for visual misfit, it failed to really improve the load conditions of the supporting implants. status: publishe...|$|E
