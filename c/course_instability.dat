The expectations from a Kraepelinian approach were that as systematic research into psychiatric health increased; diagnostic categories would be refined and targeted reliable treatments would be developed. However this reductionist approach to diagnostic categorization has led to disorders with high comorbidity, life <b>course</b> <b>instability,</b> poor treatment efficacy and poor diagnostic agreement. In addition the findings from psychopathological research have led to an increasing body of evidence suggesting overlaps between normal and maladaptive personality and interrelatedness across disorders. These findings have been further supported by genetic and developmental studies which have constantly pointed towards greater interrelatedness then the diagnostic categories can offer. These consistently disconformity findings, alongside the successful shift to a continuous rather than categorical approach in other areas of research, such as regarding ASD, led to consideration of alternative approach’s.|$|E

This paper discusses the course stability and yaw motion of ships traveling under steady wind condition in an analytical way. A course stability criterion and approximate formulas of yaw motion in steady wind including aero/hydro-dynamic force derivatives on the ship are derived. To confirm the reliability of the criterion and the formulas, the investigation results are introduced for the Pure Car Carrier (PCC) in steady wind. The results reveal that the <b>course</b> <b>instability</b> appears in head and following wind directions is mainly caused by the influence of aerodynamic derivatives with respect to the yaw restoring forces. However, the <b>course</b> <b>instability</b> can be easily improved by using a steering control. In the range from head wind to beam wind, the yaw oscillation appears where the period is relatively long and the damping is small. The analytical formulas newly derived are useful for {{a better understanding of the}} ship maneuvering behavior in steady wind. ...|$|E

The external forces predicted in such a way were used as the base for calculation of manoeuverability by means of computer programs. A new system for prediction of the coordinates of the centre of gravity of the ship during a measuring run was developed. The investigations have shown, that a containership tends to a <b>course</b> <b>instability,</b> and that the course stability makes worse in the case of decreasing speed.

This increased cancer risk is thought to result from the cellular damage induced by the inflammatory field. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the pattern and time <b>course</b> of genomic <b>instability</b> occurring in UC-related neoplasia. Sites of cancer, dysplasia, and nondysplasia from 14 UC colectomy cases containing cancer were analyzed for chromosomal alterations by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and for microsatellite instability using a series of 10 microsatellite markers. Clonal chromosomal alterations were present in 85 % of cancer sites, 86 % of dysplasia sites, and 36 % of nondysplasia sites. Losses of chromosome 18 or 18 q and chromosome 5 or 5 q were common in cancer and dysplasia and were occasionally detected in nondysplasia. High-level microsatellite instability was detected in the cancer and dysplasia of two cases. Samples that demonstrated high-level microsatellite instability were unlikely to have chromosomal alterations demonstrable by CGH. These studies suggest that the predominant type of genomic instability in UC-related neoplasia is associated with chromosomal alterations and that this type of genomic instability frequently occurs before the development of histologically defined dysplasia...|$|R

An attempt is also made in the article to reassert the importance of library history as a credible field of research through a case study of South Africa's largest academic library.

The present experiments {{were designed to}} begin to describe the developmental time <b>course</b> of this <b>instability</b> in children 2 ̆ 7 s bimanual coordination. In Experiment 1, six age groups of 4 -, 6 -, 7 -, 8 -, 10 -year-old children and adults produced unimanual dominant, unimanual nondominant, and bimanual circles. All tasks were performed at the preferred rate, size, and mode of coordination. Overall, children produced larger circles with longer durations than adults. Children were less stable in coordination. They spent more time in an intermediate phase of coordination, had a higher standard deviation in between-hand relative phase, and produced more transitions between stable coordination patterns than adults. The greatest differences in coordination occurred between four- and six-year old children. In Experiment 2, the same subjects were used. Bimanual circles were produced at increasing rates. Circle shape deteriorated as speed increased. Overall, the number of transitions decreased as speed increased. This result was most evident in the 4 -year-old children. Descriptive analysis indicated that attention and speed are potential variables to explain the less stable coordination at age four. ...|$|R

This article mainly deals with the design of an electronic three wheeled-robot capable of tracking a black line by means of infrared sensors and also capable of moving through a given trajectory by control of limit switches at a relatively high speed. The method consists first in developing a program written in Basic language under Microcode plus environment and loading it into the microcontroller to control the robot. Various PWM techniques were adopted in the programming to handle the turning left, right, the moving forward and backward. In addition, necessary hardware involving 6 V DC motor, limit switches, infrared sensors, 6 V battery and others have been assembled on a PIC 16 F 877 microprocessor board and put in a case, shaped as a vehicle. H bridge motor control and PWM were used to control the DC motors. The implementation is finally successful.

40|$|Assessment {{practices}} {{are part of}} the work of writing program administration (WPA), and the WPA function can take several forms. While some scholars champion certain constructions of WPA - be they collective, collaborative, post-masculinist, distributed, and so on - Stories that Shape: The Work of Writing Program Administration argues that what is most crucial isn’t that a program implements a particular construction, but that the specific construction in play suits the specific context of the program in which it is located. And because programs change - because the larger field of rhetoric and composition changes - the work of WPA, and the construction of the position of a writing program administrator, must change accordingly and appropriately. Stories that Shape outlines the history of URI’s Department of Writing and Rhetoric, starting with its housing in the English department, moving through the development of its major, and up through its existence as a stand-alone department that offers a bachelor of arts, situating these changes in a historical and local context. It then {{tells the story of the}} WPA work that two committees undertook. The first was the round of outcomes-based assessment of general education writing courses that the Assessment Committee orchestrated. The second outlines the changes that the First-Year Writing Committee made to the general education learning outcomes and to the department’s most frequently offered course, WRT 104 : Writing to Inform and Explain. These stories illustrate the department’s collaborative, distributive WPA model. Further, they demonstrate the ways that WPA work is formative, generative, and rhetorical, capable of creating change at the department, program, and classroom level. Nationally (and locally), the majority of general education courses (including writing) are taught by instructors off the tenure-track. This includes per-course instructors and graduate teaching assistants, a population whose professional identity is often in flux or under scrutiny. Gaining a sense of what the teaching majority values and believes about teaching writing is essential for anyone doing WPA work. Through anonymous surveys and semi-structured interviews with per-course instructors and graduate teaching assistants, Stories that Shape explores three issues that should be of interest to writing program administrators and those responsible for WPA work. Research participants were asked to outline their own teaching objectives (as they relate or do not relate to the department’s general education learning objectives); to define teachability (what they value in textbooks and teaching resources); and to reflect on the value of teaching disciplinary terms and concepts in first-year, general education <b>courses.</b> These <b>instabilities</b> can be perspectives that writing program administrators, compositions, and writing scholars use to understand the field - broadly and generally - and they can be perspectives that enable them to ask how, why, and whether or not a program or department - locally and specifically - can, should, or even wants to change...|$|R
30|$|The {{finding that}} {{patients}} with bipolar disorder type II experienced more instability for depressive symptoms compared with patients with bipolar disorder type I {{is in line with}} findings from other studies including a study from our group suggesting that bipolar disorder type II is not simply a less serious subtype of bipolar disorder (Bopp et al. 2010; Judd et al. 2003; Joffe et al. 2004; Kupka et al. 2007; Vinberg et al. 2017). During the last decades there has been an increased shift from a focus on awareness of the impact of inter-episodic mood instability (MacQueen et al. 2003; Harrison et al. 2016), and a substantial proportion of patients with bipolar disorder experience subsyndromal mood swings on a daily basis even though they overall seem to be in remission. Mood instability is associated with poor prognostic factors including impaired functioning, increased risk of hospitalization, high risk of relapse, and comorbid substance use disorder (Bopp et al. 2010; Judd et al. 2003; Joffe et al. 2004; Kupka et al. 2007; Strejilevich et al. 2013; Patel et al. 2015; O’Donnell et al. 2018; Gershon and Eidelman 2015). The patients in the present study had a mean illness duration of 18.0  years (SD 10.1) and several prior depressive and manic episodes. Studies investigating whether differences in mood instability between bipolar disorder type I and bipolar disorder type II are intrinsic to bipolar disorder or a consequence of illness progression have not been conducted. However, illness duration was included as a possible confounder in the statistical analyses in the present study and did not alter the estimates. Smartphone-based monitoring of mood and mood instability in high-risk groups such as the adolescent and emerging adult offspring of parents with bipolar disorder may be a fruitful new direction of early identification and characterization of the prospective <b>course</b> of mood <b>instability</b> (Duffy et al. 2018; Kessing et al. 2017).|$|R

The typical routes by which individuals and families access insurance coverage are frequently threatened in times of change, and alternative, affordable sources of coverage are often difficult to come by. This dissertation examines the linkages between life <b>course</b> transitions and <b>instability</b> in health insurance coverage in the late 1990 s and early 2000 s. The three substantive chapters consider {{the extent to which}} divorce, job loss, and the transition to adulthood threaten the stability and continuity {{of health insurance}}, and how these linkages can be modified through changes in public policy. In Chapter 2, “Divorce and Women’s Risk of Health Insurance Loss,” I document that many women experience a significant risk of health insurance loss in the months following divorce, and that overall coverage rates remain depressed {{for more than two years}} after divorce. Chapter 3, “Job Loss and Health Insurance in the Great Recession: Did the COBRA Subsidy Work?,” considers the difficulty of maintaining insurance coverage following job loss, and evaluates the effects of temporary policy change which reduced the price of purchasing COBRA through a former employer. Although workers with access to the subsidy purchased COBRA at moderately higher rates, many still experienced gaps in coverage after job loss. In Chapter 4, “Health Insurance in Young Adulthood: Less Instability Since the Affordable Care Act?,” I assess changes in the level and stability in health insurance coverage of young adults following the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of parental dependent coverage up to age 26. I find that the policy change increased overall coverage rates for young adults primarily by filling gaps in coverage for those with higher-SES parents, rather than increasing coverage for the chronically uninsured. Looking forward, the full implementation of the Affordable Care Act in January 2014 may both enable greater access to health insurance for low-income individuals and families who currently face chronic barriers to coverage and enhance the security of health insurance over the life course...|$|R
40|$|In {{an earlier}} post, I argued that {{leadership}} scholars have much devoted {{much of their}} attention to developing theories of leadership that address the question "What is leadership?" but less attention to the more basic question "What is leadership for?" In this essay, I offer some thoughts on the latter question that draws and expands on ideas I have expressed previously about leadership in complex systems. As argued by the late historian Tony Judt (2010), we have entered an age of insecurity. The effects of anthropogenic climate change, which are yet to be fully realised, will further heighten these insecurities. Of <b>course,</b> insecurity, <b>instability,</b> and uncertainty have always been with us. However, it has been some time since they have had such a marked existential edge. In this context, it is incumbent on all of us, not just experts and authorities, to take the wider view of the state we are in, where we are going, and where {{we would like to}} be. This, I think, is the social and existential context in which the question "What is leadership for?" ought to be asked and answered. Here is a provisional answer to this question, and it is an answer with two parts. First, it is to ensure that the social systems of which we are members (e. g., organisations, communities) have the adaptive and/or transformative capacity to stay connected with the social-ecological systems in which they are nested and dependent (e. g., economies, environments). Second, it is to ensure that the behaviour of our social systems enhances these social-ecological systems. Let me say a few words about the assumptions and reasoning that undergirds this answer. Historically, we have thought very little about our biophysical environments, which have been stable for millennia, providing what Rockström et al. (2009) call a "safe operating space for humanity. " By contrast, we have thought a great deal about our economies, which are frequently volatile and personally experienced as such. However, evidence is mounting that the environmental stability on which our civilizations - which includes our economies - depend can no longer be assumed to continue indefinitely. If the search for economic stability was a preoccupation of the twentieth century, the search for climate stability will likely become a preoccupation of the twenty-first. Although the full reality of what it will be like coping with volatility in two major (and linked) social-ecological systems is not yet known, life in this environment will test the adaptive and transformative capacity of our organisations and communities. These challenges will, by extension, also test leadership in these organisations and communities. In this context, questions about leadership style and leadership development will likely be as prominent as they are today. However important these questions are, their answers are most instructive when one understands, first, what leadership is for. Questions of style are subsidiary to those of substance. On the face of it, the question "What is leadership for?" admits no simple answers because there are as many answers to this question as there are groups, teams, organisations, and institutions in which leadership is exercised. However, I am less interested in the specific purposes of leadership in specific groups than I am in the basic or fundamental purpose of leadership {{in the context of the}} looming challenges outlined above.   Read the full article > Photo Credit: VinothChandar via Compfight c...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a Neurodevelopmental Disorder that onsets {{during the}} {{childhood}} and persists into adulthood in {{two-thirds of the}} cases. The comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders such as Bipolar Disorder (BD) and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) can influence the developmental trajectory. The presence of mood symptoms may complicate the diagnosis of adult ADHD. On the other hand, psychiatric comorbidity may disguise ADHD clinical picture {{making it difficult to}} have an appropriate diagnosis. A failure to distinguish or correctly identify the coexistence of BD, BPD, and ADHD can result in treatment and therapeutic mistakes; it can also be {{one of the reasons for}} the underachievement of therapeutic and outcome targets in several patients. Aims of the study: The main purpose is to examine clinical differences and similarities in mood symptoms, illness course, temperamental and clinical associated features in a BD sample grouped on the basis of the presence/absence of ADHD diagnosis and BPD features. The secondary objective is the identification of clinical features useful to differentiate ADHD from BPD patients. Material and Methods: 374 patients meeting the DSM-IV criteria for BD were consecutively recruited in the inpatient and outpatient settings of the Psychiatry Unit (UO 1) of Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria of Pisa over a period of about 1 year. The sample includes 184 female (48. 1 %) and 194 male subjects (51. 9 %). All the patients were evaluated with the SCID I for the assessment of Axis I psychiatric disorders and the BPD module of SCID II. Data regarding the diagnosis of BD were recorded by means of SIMD, semi-structured interview allowing the systematic collection of information regarding the current episode, the course and family history. ADHD has been confirmed with the DIVA 2. 0, a semi-structured interview for the diagnosis of ADHD according to DSM-IV, whereas BPD diagnosis was confirmed throughout the DIB. The functioning and the severity of the illness were evaluated with GAF and CGI scales respectively. Statistical analyses: For comparison between groups, we used chi-square test for categorical variables and Student’s t-test for continuous variables, using p<. 05. Two stepwise forward logistic regression models were then used to identify DSM-IV BPD criteria and BD clinical variables predicting the diagnosis of ADHD with p<. 05. Results: The study population included 374 patients suffering for BD (BD-I 52. 7 %, BD-II 47. 3 %); 180 were females (48. 1 %) and 194 males (51. 9 %), with a mean age of 45. 57 years (SD 15. 06, range 18 - 79). Comorbid ADHD and BPD rated 7. 8 % and 19. 5 % respectively. The three-group comparison showed that female gender was prominent in the BPD group. ADHD and BPD patients were younger, more frequently never married or divorced and unemployed comparing to BD patients. With respect to the clinical features of BD, BD-II was more frequent in BPD patients, which presented a clinical profile similar to ADHD, clearly differentiated from BD patients as shown by the earlier age at onset of BD, high rates of comorbid Cyclothymic Disorder, similar rates of rapid cycling, similar rates in the mean number of previous depressive, manic and mixed episodes, comparable severity and functional impairment. ADHD and BPD also showed similar comorbidity pattern with alcohol and substance abuse disorders as well as similar temperamental profiles: indeed all the affective temperaments reached mean scores higher than BD patients. Some differences in the clinical profiles emerged: BPD presented higher mean number of previous suicide attempts, more frequently atypical features and higher comorbidity rates with anxiety (namely panic and generalized anxiety disorders) and eating disorders. By the contrary ADHD reported a higher number of hypomanic episodes. Noteworthy, the 41. 4 % of ADHD patients met the criteria for a BPD diagnosis too. The regression analyses confirmed that the presence of more hypomanic episodes and male gender predicted the ADHD diagnosis, whereas atypical features and suicidality were associated to BPD. Therefore, a two-group comparison was performed concerning DSM-IV BPD criteria: no differences emerged for 4 out of the 9 criteria (emotional instability, difficulty in controlling rage, transient paranoia/dissociation and with less extent impulsivity). In comparison with ADHD, BPD reported more frequently frantic efforts to avoid real or imaged abandonment, unstable and intense relationships, identity disturbance, recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures or threats and chronic feelings of emptiness. The regression analysis, involving also the gender among the independent variables, showed that ADHD diagnosis was actually not predicted only by female gender, recurrent suicidal behaviors, self-injury and chronic feelings of emptiness. Limitations: Low number of ADHD patients. Retrospective, non-blind design, may affect the ADHD diagnosis with recall bias. Selection bias in treatment-seeking patients in a third level university center. Discussion: In our clinical sample, BPD and ADHD patients showed few clinical differences. BPD patients were more frequently females with prevalently depressive course and showed more atypical features, higher rate of suicide attempts, and a different pattern of comorbidities with higher rates of anxiety and eating disorders. ADHD patients were more frequently males with a prevalently hypomanic course. However, most of the bipolar clinical variables considered such as BD-II subtype, very high rate of Cyclothymic Disorder, early age at onset, number of different polarity mood episodes, rapid cycling, severity of the illness and its impact on functioning, temperamental features and familial load for mood disorders resulted similar in patients with comorbid ADHD and BPD and different from other BD patients. Moreover, about half of the ADHD subsample had an adjunctive BPD diagnosis. This overlap supports the hypothesis that ADHD and BPD might be related each other and represent distinct clinical BD phenotypes. Alternatively, a shared factor may influence the similarities in temperamental and course characteristics. In a more hypothetical vein, we submit that affective lability disposition might represent the mediating core characteristic in the complex pattern of mood, anxiety, and impulsive disorders that ADHD and BPD patients report in developmental age. Anxious-sensitive symptomatology and hostile-impulsive-addictive behavior, rather than being considered independent comorbidities, might represent features related to such affective lability diathesis, largely pinpointed by common familial traits. Some differences however can be detected in the context of this instability diathesis as BPD patients showed a prominent depressive-anxious <b>course,</b> whereas affective <b>instability</b> in ADHD may assume more a hypomanic-colored course. Anyway, in this perspective cyclothymic-type mood instability may represent a neurodevelopmental condition shared by other disorders of the same nature such as ADHD, autistic spectrum disorder, Tourette’s plus syndrome and cognitive disability. Further prospective longitudinal study on high risk populations are necessary to better define the possible relationships among BD, ADHD and BPD and other neurodevelopmental disorders...|$|R
