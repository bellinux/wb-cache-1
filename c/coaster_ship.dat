50|$|In April 28, 1952 PEPUSKA was dissolved. Pelni (now as a company, not a foundation) {{was founded}} {{at the same}} day, with the same fleet. To bring more power, Indonesian Eximbank {{provided}} funding to buy 45 new <b>coaster</b> <b>ships</b> from Western Europe countries, and while waiting these new ships being produced, rent various ships from many countries. Pelni also used ships looted from Japan in World War 2. These strategy was proven successful, as KPM suffered from declining market share and strike workers led by Sukarno's leftist doctrine. KPM discontinued it's Indonesian operation in December 3, 1957.|$|R

50|$|With {{construction}} of the new Pittsburgh International Airport underway in the late 1980s, a reroute of PA 60 (renumbered I-376 in 2009) was needed for access. After the park's 1989 season, Pennsylvania Department of Transportation bought the park. Dismantling of the park began the following year. The amusements and other artifacts were sold at auction. The Mad Mouse was moved to Lakemont Park in Altoona, Pennsylvania but was sold and removed in 2003. The Galaxi <b>coaster</b> was <b>shipped</b> to Lubbock, Texas.

In each level Mr. Do seeks to avoid the coaster cars and other dangerous objects and {{reach the end of}} the course to advance to the next level. The EXTRA motif reappears though in a less controllable manner based on the timing with which the course is completed.|$|R

Møller bought {{a large share of}} the stocks intending to merge the yard with Odense Steel Shipyard, but it was later bought by A/S Carl Nielsen. Under the leadership of former Ø.K.-director Per Glente the yard expanded reaching a peak in the period 1988-1992 when the Royal Danish Navy ordered four new Ocean Patrol Vessels. Efforts were made to sell similar ships to South Africa and other countries, but after the production of two <b>Coasters</b> no more <b>ships</b> were ordered before the company was declared bankrupt in 1999. A series of attempts were made to keep production on site but in 2001 the site at Frederiksø in Svendborg was ultimately closed.|$|R
2500|$|In the Second World War, Kriegsmarine E-boats and U-boats {{attacked}} British coastal shipping both by torpedo and by minelaying. Most <b>coasters</b> {{were slow}} <b>ships</b> built for economy, and thus easy targets. They were therefore organised into convoys, {{but at first}} these had few escorts and scant Defensively Equipped Merchant Ship armament. Gasfire sailed in FN and FS series convoys, which stood for [...] "Forth North" [...] and [...] "Forth South". FN convoys assembled off Southend-on-Sea and sailed to Methil on the Firth of Forth; FS convoys did the reverse. From January to October 1940 Gasfire made up to three round trips a month between Beckton and the Tyne, leaving each FN convoy and joining each FS convoy off the Tyne Estuary.|$|R
50|$|The American Adventure, {{built on}} {{an area of}} Country Park which had been subject to deep seam and {{opencast}} coal mining, was originally opened in June 1987 with an Old West and Cowboys vs. Native Americans theme. A theme park called Britannia Park had been opened on the site in 1985 but closed after just 10 weeks, insolvent, and its founder Peter Kellard was later imprisoned for fraud. Derbyshire County Council purchased the site in 1986 and sold it to Granada, who in June 1987 opened the American Adventure, heralded as Britain's Major New Theme Park. Initial attractions at the American Adventure included the two-drop log flume, the runaway mine train, the Buffalo Stampede roller <b>coaster,</b> a pirate <b>ship,</b> and a Ferris wheel.|$|R
