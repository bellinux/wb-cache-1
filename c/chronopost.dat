40|$|On July 3, 2003, in the <b>Chronopost</b> judgment, the European Court of Justice (2 ̆ 2 ECJ 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 the Court 2 ̆ 2) {{defined the}} {{conditions}} under which a public undertaking, enjoying a legal monopoly for the provision of services of general interest, can provide services to its subsidiaries without infringing Article 87 (1) of the EC Treaty. The impact of this judgment on European Community (2 ̆ 2 EC 2 ̆ 2) state aid policy and public services is potentially large, in both legal and practical terms. The ruling casts light on the real dilemma underlying the application of state aid rules to the circumstances of the case: how to allow public companies, entrusted with a network enabling them to provide a given service to all users, to operate in competitive markets while, at the same time, preventing these public operators from unduly exploiting the specific advantages of their position as network operators, in terms of economies of scale/scope, on the downstream competitive markets. This article deals with the principles defined by the ECJ in the <b>Chronopost</b> ruling...|$|E
30|$|We {{should also}} mention other {{measures}} which combat CO 2 emissions. The “CO 2 charter” {{brought in by}} the MEEDDAT in 2007 {{in order to meet}} the country’s undertakings under the Kyoto protocol, i.e. not to emit more greenhouse gases in 2012 than in 1990. It had been signed by 10 road haulage companies in 2008 (including <b>Chronopost,</b> Geodis and Dentressangle), but has been signed by many more companies since the abandonment of the carbon tax, as though road haulage firms felt that they ought to choose their manner of participating in carbon emissions reductions themselves.|$|E
30|$|With {{regards to}} freight, wesuggest a {{different}} conclusion. If some conditions are met (seebelow), consultations are useful, and a necessary basis for an urbanfreightpolicy.In Paris and Ile de France, {{there were many}} positive outcomes resulting from the consultations, {{and some of them}} have directly influenced urban freight policies [21], resulting in some interesting developments. Two main successes so far can be identified. (1) The global reorganization of on-street delivery bays has led to more numerous, better protected and better designed delivery bays available to delivery vehicles. (2) Nearly a dozen city logistics experiments have been conducted in Paris, with strong support coming from the Paris Freight Charter’s partners. The impacts of these projects are quite significant, although only at the level of each experiment. For example, a new organisation of <b>Chronopost</b> (an express carrier) for its delivery operations in the central districts of Paris has saved diesel powered vehicles 41, 000  km and reduced CO 2 emissions by 23 tons per year, a decrease of 60 % compared to the previous situation 8 [26]. Other propositions or decisions resulting from the freight consultations have not yet resulted in effective policies. These include, for example, the protection of land parcels for logistics activities or the promotion of cleaner vehicles through environmental standards. The obstacles, as we mentioned above, came from the fact that Paris, as a single municipality, was not able to enforce the measures or to deal with regional logistics activities in a coherent way.|$|E
40|$|The author {{highlights}} the balancing act {{both on the}} regulatory {{as well as on}} the institutional level between state aid control and the liberalization of public services. He focuses on partially liberalized markets and tackling cross-subsidisation where Member States infringe the competitive neutrality of the privatisation process by various funding schemes. These are all subject to three criteria linked to the private investor test. Once partially liberalized, sectors traditionally shaped by public service obligations are prone to state intervention owing to the special needs they fulfil. Starting from the premise that the concept of universal services is designed to combine public policy objectives with a fully competitive market, the author allocates the role of state aid control as both a specific mandate avoiding selective distortions through the granting of state resources imputable to the State and as a regulatory mandate to maintain a level playing field for all undertakings in the Internal Market. The jurisprudence of Community Courts – e. g. UFEX, <b>Chronopost</b> and Laboratoires Boiron - is faced with the demarcation of the European Commission's powers and the determination of the nature and extent of judicial review. Its analysis focuses on cost calculation and allocation in search of crosssubsidisation of liberalised market segments by using state resources originally designed to compensate for public service obligations. He closes with the assumption that, because of the narrow confines of aleatory references made to the Courts, preference should be given to a best practice approach to cost allocation standard...|$|E
