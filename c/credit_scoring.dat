25|$|In Norway, <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> {{services}} {{are provided by}} three <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> agencies: Dun & Bradstreet, Experian and Lindorff Decision. <b>Credit</b> <b>scoring</b> is based on publicly available information such as demographic data, tax returns, taxable income and any Betalingsanmerkning (non-payment records) that might be registered on the credit-scored individual. Upon being scored, an individual will receive a notice (written or by e-mail) from the scoring agency stating who performed the credit score {{as well as any}} information provided in the score. In addition, many credit institutions use custom scorecards based on any number of parameters. Credit scores range between 300 and 900.|$|E
25|$|In Austria, <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> is {{done as a}} blacklist. Consumers who did not {{pay bills}} {{end up on the}} blacklists that are held by {{different}} credit bureaus. Having an entry on the black list may result in the denial of contracts. Certain enterprises including telecom carriers use the list on a regular basis.

All <b>credit</b> <b>scores</b> must be subject to availability. The credit bureaus all have their own credit scores: Equifax's ScorePower ( [...] FICO score from Equifax [...] ), Equifax <b>Credit</b> <b>Score,</b> Experian's PLUS <b>score,</b> and TransUnion's <b>credit</b> <b>score,</b> and each also sells the VantageScore <b>credit</b> <b>score.</b> In addition, many large lenders, including the major credit card issuers, have developed their own proprietary scoring models.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} an emerging financial education program, financial coaching. This study investigated whether participants improved their <b>credit</b> <b>scores</b> after participating in a financial coaching program. Four hypotheses were examined: (1) Financial coaching improves the <b>credit</b> <b>scores</b> of its participants. (2) Financial coaching has a greater impact on improving <b>credit</b> <b>scores</b> for women compared to men. (3) Financial coaching has a greater impact on improving <b>credit</b> <b>scores</b> for younger participants compared to the older ones. (4) Financial coaching has a greater impact on improving <b>credit</b> <b>scores</b> for minorities compared to non-minorities. For hypothesis 1, a paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare the last <b>credit</b> <b>score</b> and the first <b>credit</b> <b>score</b> at each site, both separately and collectively. For hypotheses 2 – 4, a hierarchical regression analysis was conducted on the total of all six sites collectively and evaluated on each site separately. First score, gender (hypothesis 2), age (hypothesis 3), and race (hypothesis 4) were entered into the regression to predict the last score. For hypotheses 1, for five of the six sites, there was no significant difference between the first and last <b>credit</b> <b>scores</b> for participants. When all six sites were combined, there was a significant difference between the first and last <b>credit</b> <b>scores.</b> For hypotheses 2, there was no gender difference in average <b>credit</b> <b>scores.</b> However, when comparing the average increase in <b>credit</b> <b>scores,</b> the females had a slightly higher increase than males. For hypothesis 3, older participants’ average <b>credit</b> <b>scores</b> increased more than that of the younger ones’ scores. For hypotheses 4, there was no race difference in average <b>credit</b> <b>scores.</b> However, when comparing the ranges in average <b>credit</b> <b>scores</b> between African-Americans and Caucasians, African-Americans’ range did improve slightly more than the range of Caucasians.

50|$|If a {{borrower}} has poor {{to moderate}} credit history, MMI probably {{is much less}} expensive with an FHA insured loan than with a conventional loan regardless of LTV - sometimes as little as one-ninth as much depending on the borrower's <b>credit</b> <b>score,</b> LTV, loan size, and approval status. Conventional mortgage insurance rates increase as <b>credit</b> <b>scores</b> decrease, whereas FHA mortgage insurance rates do not vary with <b>credit</b> <b>score.</b> Conventional mortgage premiums spike dramatically if the borrower's <b>credit</b> <b>score</b> is lower than 620.

50|$|In {{reviewing}} {{a credit}} report, the <b>credit</b> <b>score</b> is considered. The <b>credit</b> <b>score</b> is {{an indicator of}} how well a borrower manages debt. Using a mathematical model, the data regarding each item on the credit report is used to produce a number between 350 and 850, known as the <b>credit</b> <b>score.</b> Higher scores represent those with less risk. When lenders refer to a representative <b>credit</b> <b>score,</b> they are referring to the median score. When multiple borrowers are involved typically the borrower with lowest median score {{is the one that}} is considered the representative <b>credit</b> <b>score.</b> Other loan programs may consider the person that earns the most money, also known as the primary wage earner, that has the representative <b>credit</b> <b>score.</b> On many loan programs there are minimum score guidelines.|$|R

25|$|Sweden has {{a system}} for <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> that aims to find people {{with a history of}} neglect to pay bills or, most commonly, taxes. Anyone who does not pay their debts on time, and fails to make {{payments}} after a reminder, will have their case forwarded to the Swedish Enforcement Authority which is a national authority for collecting debts. The mere appearance of a company, or government office, as a debtor to this authority will result in a record among private credit bureaus; however, this does not apply to individuals as debtors. This record is called a Betalningsanmärkning (non-payment record) and by law can be stored for three years for an individual and five years for a company. This kind of nonpayment record will make it very difficult to get a loan, rent an apartment, get telephone subscriptions, rent a car or get a job where you handle cash. The banks, also use income and asset figures in connection with loan assessments.|$|E

Further, mortgage, auto, and student loan inquiries do not count at all in a FICO score if they are less than 30 days old. While all credit inquiries are recorded and displayed on personal credit reports for two years, they have no effect after the first year because FICO's scoring system ignores them after 12 months.

TITLE: <b>CREDIT</b> <b>SCORE</b> ANALYSIS MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Dwight R. Sanders A person’s <b>credit</b> <b>score</b> defines their <b>credit</b> and lending ability throughout their life. Building a <b>credit</b> <b>score</b> {{takes time and}} multiple steps. However, there are {{not a lot of}} studies done that help define the effects different variables have on <b>credit</b> <b>scores</b> and the effects different variables have on interest rates. This study explores the effects of age, income, and debt to income ratio have on a person’s <b>credit</b> <b>score.</b> It explores the effects <b>credit</b> <b>score,</b> amount of the loan, term of the loan and loan type (agriculture, real-estate, and consumer) have on the interest rate a lender offers a customer. This report will be helpful for those who are trying to improve their <b>credit</b> <b>score</b> as well as for lenders who want to know what influences interest rates. Using the results, consumers can focus on the main factors that influence their <b>credit</b> <b>score.</b> By doing so, they can work on those areas to improve their score. Also, professional banks can focus on the main variables that impact the interest rates they offer. This shows the lending field what actually determines the consumer interest rates...|$|R
