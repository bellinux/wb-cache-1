Through {{the set up}} of a {{calculation}} model on film cooling in the primary zone of an annular combustor, a parametrical study was made {{on the relationship of}} film cooling effectiveness and wall temperature with configuration parameters such as <b>cooling</b> <b>slot</b> height and TBC thickness. Through parametrical study, {{it can be seen that}} with all the parameters kept the same and even the resulting effectiveness of the outer liner slightly greater due to a slightly higher blow ratio, the outer liner temperatures are considerably higher than the inner liner temperatures. The calculation shows, with cooling effectiveness, there are optimum values of coolant injection angle and film <b>cooling</b> <b>slot</b> height, while there is a monotonous tendency for the relationship of cooling effectiveness with other parameters such as tapered angle on nugget lip, starting edge angle at nugget-slot exit and lip thickness. The study demonstrates that the higher the TBC thickness, the lower the highest value of base metal temperatures, but when the TBC thickens, it becomes heavier, and the possibility of TBC spallation gets greater...|$|E

To {{improve the}} cooling {{efficiency}} of turbine blade, a multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) system involving aerodynamics, heat transfer and structures has been developed. In this system, a MDO procedure for a turbine blade with complicate internal structure is performed. The structural size of rib turbulators, partitions and trailing edge <b>cooling</b> <b>slots,</b> which serve as design variables, {{is used for}} parametric modeling of three dimensional turbine blade. Conjugate heat transfer analysis is employed to get {{the temperature of the}} blade. The temperature in the blade body obtained from former coupled analysis is specified as boundary conditions for structural analysis. Meanwhile, a combined algorithm of multi-island genetic algorithm (MIGA) and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) is applied for optimization in specified space. While the flow rate of cooling air remains unchanged, the maximum and average temperatures of the blade decrease under the condition of meeting the strength requirement. The result shows that the cooling efficiency of turbine blade is improved, and the system exhibits higher stability, feasibility and efficiency for engineering applications...|$|R
40|$|As the {{research}} into the improvement of gas turbine performance progresses, the combustor- turbine interface becomes of increasing importance. In new engine designs components come closer together {{and the study of}} the combustor and turbine interactions can prove to be valuable for the improvement of the aerothermal performance of the vane. This thesis presents an experimental and numerical investigation of the aerodynamic and heat transfer aspect of the interactions between the combustor and the nozzle guide vane. In the gas turbine studied the trailing edge of the combustor transition duct wall is found upstream of every second vane. In the experimental measurements carried out in a purpose-built high speed experimental facility, the wake of this wall is shown to increase the aerodynamic loss of the vane. On the other hand, the wall alters secondary flow structures and has a protective effect on the heat transfer in the leading edge-endwall junction, a region that has proven to be detrimental to component life. The effect of different clocking positions of the vane relative to the combustor wall are tested experimentally and shown to alter the aerodynamic field and the heat transfer to the vane. The experimental methods and processing techniques adopted in this work are utilized to highlight the differences between the different cases studied. A new concept of using the combustor wall to shield the nozzle guide vane leading edge is introduced, followed by a proposed design that is numerically analysed, including a new cooling system. This uses continuous <b>cooling</b> <b>slots</b> on the upstream combustor wall to cool the vane leading edge. Coolant to the endwalls is provided from continuous slots on the combustor-turbine interface. The reduction of secondary flow through the removal of the horseshoe vortex in the new design results in improved cooling of the endwalls, with a higher average adiabatic effectiveness than in the original case, using the same coolant mass flow rate. The vane surface and suction side are also successfully cooled using less air than that required for a showerhead. The new vane is tested in the experimental facility. The improved aerodynamic and thermal performance of the shielded vane is demonstrated under engine-representative inlet conditions. The new design is shown to have a lower average total pressure loss than the original vane for all inlet conditions. The heat transfer on the vane surface is overall reduced for all inlet conditions and the peak heat transfer on the vane leading edge-endwall junction is moved further upstream, to a region that can be effectively cooled from the upstream <b>cooling</b> <b>slots</b> on the combustor wall trailing edge and the endwalls. </p...|$|R
40|$|Partially open {{cavities}} are {{encountered in}} various engineering {{systems such as}} electronic cooling devices and cooling for gas turbine blades, instead of conventional film <b>cooling</b> <b>slots.</b> Flow is to be imparted over the partially open cavity where it induces a shear layer and a shear driven vortex within the cavity, which is subjected to cooling effect at its wall. Depending on the opening ratio, heat and mass transfer occur between the main flow and the trapped vortex through the shear layer. In the present study, RANS simulations of such flow have been conducted for circular and square cavities to investigate the effect of opening ratio on the heat and mass transfer characteristics. The simulations were established on a rigorous numerical approach and proper validation with LDV measurements of turbulent flow in circular cavity. Based on the hydraulic diameter of the cavity, opening ratios ranging from 0. 2 to 1. 0 were investigated for a Reynolds number of 3 × 105. Generally, the maximum Nusselt number (Nu) was achieved at higher opening ratios for both circular and rectangle cavities.

40|$|Both {{computational}} {{and experimental}} {{results are presented}} for studying the three-dimensional flow in an annular gas turbine combustor. The computational approach attempts to strike a reasonable balance to handle the competing aspects of the complicated physical and chemical interactions of the flow, and the requirements in resolving the three-dimensional geometrical constraints of the combustor contours, film <b>cooling</b> <b>slots,</b> and circular dilution holes. The algorithm employs non-orthogonal curvilinear coordinates, second-order accurate discretizations, multigrid iterative solution procedure, the standard k-ε turbulence model, and a combustion model comprising of an assumed probability density function and the conserved scalar variable formulation. To assess {{the performance of the}} numerical algorithm, three different annular combustor flows with in-house experimental measurements are investigated. Overall, it is found that good theory/data agreement of the characteristic temperature pattern in the exit plane can be obtained. The influence of changing the dilution hole arrangements on the combustor performance is well predicted. The complicated mixing process can be better understood with more detailed information supplied by the numerical simulation. It is concluded that for the normal operating condition where the physical process is likely to be dominant, the performance of a gas turbine combustor can be predicted by the present methodology. © 1989...|$|R

40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of gas turbine combustors is a crucial but uncertain part of an engine development process. Combustion within a gas turbine is a complex interaction of, among other things, fluid dynamics, heat and mass transfer and chemical kinetics. At present, the design process relies upon a wealth of experimental data and correlations. The proper use of this information requires experienced combustion engineers and even for them the design process is very time consuming. Some major engine manufacturers have attempted to address the above problem by developing one dimensional computer programs based on the above test and empirical data to assist combustor designers. Such programs are usually proprietary. The present work, based on this approach has yielded DEPTH, a combustor design program. DEPTH (Design and Evaluation of Pressure, Temperature and Heat transfer in combustors) is developed in Fortran- 77 to assist in preliminary design and evaluation of conventional gas turbine combustion chambers. DEPTH {{can be used to}} carry out a preliminary design along with prediction of the <b>cooling</b> <b>slots</b> for a given metal temperature limit or to evaluate heat transfer and temperatures for an existing combustion chamber. Analysis of performance parameters such as efficiency, stability and NOx based on stirred reactor theories is also coupled. DEPTH is made sufficiently interactive/user-friendly such that no prior expertise is required as far as computer operation is concerned. The range of variables such as operating conditions, geometry, hardware, fuel type can all be effectively examined and their contribution towards the combustor performance studied. Such comprehensive study should provide ample opportunity for the designer to make the right decisions. It should also be an effective study aid. Returns in terms of higher thermal efficiencies is an incentive to go for combined cycles and cogeneration. In such cases, opting for higher cycle pressures together with a second or reheat combustor promise higher thermal efficiencies and exhaust temperatures and hence such designs are likely to be of interest. The concepts that are needed for understanding a double or reheat combustor are also addressed using the programme. A specific application of the programme is demonstrated through the design of a double combustor...|$|R

50|$|The 512 MB {{version of}} the GeForce 7800 GTX was {{released}} on November 14, 2005. The card features more than simply an increased frame buffer from 256 MB to 512 MB. The card features a much improved core clock speed of 550 MHz vs. 430 MHz (27.9% increase) and fast 1.1 ns GDDR3 memory clocked at 1.7 GHz vs. 1.2 GHz (41.7% increase), {{when compared to the}} original version. Like ATI's X1800 XT, the addition of another 256 MB of memory, and to a lesser extent, the increased clock speeds, have raised the heat and power output significantly. To combat this, the GeForce 7800 GTX 512 sports a much larger yet quieter dual <b>slot</b> <b>cooling</b> solution when compared to the original 256 MB version.|$|R
40|$|The large {{viscous drag}} of {{hypersonic}} vehicles {{is a major}} obstacle to the successful development of vehicles for prolonged atmospheric travel at high Mach numbers. On such vehicles, this skin-friction drag can be of similar magnitude {{to that of the}} inviscid drag on the body. To improve the vehicle’s performance, the net thrust of the propulsion system has to be enhanced, either by increasing the thrust force or by reducing the vehicle drag. Here, reductions in viscous drag can offer a large margin for improvement of the net thrust level. One of the methods for the reduction of supersonic skin friction is the injection of low-density gas into the boundary layer (film cooling). In a recent development, film <b>cooling</b> by <b>slot</b> injection of hydrogen was combined with its combustion within the boundary layer. Analysis and experiments indicated substantial reductions of supersonic skin-friction drag. This paper provides further evidence for substantial skin-friction reductions by presenting shock-tunnel data of direct drag measurements in a circular supersonic combustion chamber with and without pressure gradients and with and without combustion of hydrogen in the boundary layer. The measurements are compared with theories, and the influence of entropy layers and combustor size is investigated. Measurements show a reduction of viscous drag of up to 77 %...|$|R
