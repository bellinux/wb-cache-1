50|$|The {{standard}} conveyor uses {{a specially}} designed plastic crescent top chain. The chain actually runs on its side (on its link plates), with the crescent plate attached {{to the other side}} plate by means of a snap pin. This gives the chain a very small bending radius and allows the conveyor to make the tight corners found in most conveyor belt sushi restaurants. Further, the horizontal layout means that there is no return side of the chain, which not only eliminates <b>chain</b> <b>sag</b> and sliding with the roller, but allows for a much shallower design.|$|E
25|$|The fourth {{match was}} a Double Dog Collar match between The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobs and Jerry Sags) and Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge). Rock was {{connected}} to Sags, and Grunge {{was connected to}} Knobs. All four fought to the outside, and used several weapons on each other. Grunge performed a bulldog on Knobs on a steel chair. Rock performed a somersault legdrop on Sags and performed an axe handle to him through a table. All four eventually return to the ring, where The Public Enemy had the advantage. Rock went to the top turnbuckle, but <b>Sags</b> pulled the <b>chain,</b> and Rock fell onto the table. Knobs repeatedly attacked Grunge with the <b>chain.</b> <b>Sags</b> then hit an axe handle with the chain on Rock, who was on a table. Knobs hanged Grunge with the chain over the top rope as The Nasty Boys delivered a clothesline to Rock with the <b>chain.</b> <b>Sags</b> hit Rock with the chain, and pinned him for The Nasty Boys to win.|$|R
60|$|Getting on {{his hands}} and knees, he crawled along the bottom of the pile. The logs were not numerous, since some had been used, and when Charnock reached the end he {{crouched}} in the snow and looked about. Nobody was there and his ears were not of much use because the crash of ice drowned every other sound. This made silence needless, and he tried to get between the logs and the water, but found it dangerous. The <b>chain</b> had <b>sagged</b> with the strain, and the lowest tier was scarcely a foot from the bank, along which the ice-floes rasped.|$|R
60|$|In {{one place}} {{there was a}} public {{building}} which was fenced about with a thick, rusty <b>chain,</b> which <b>sagged</b> from post to post in a succession of low swings. The pavement, here, was made of heavy blocks of stone. In {{the glare of the}} moon a party of barefooted children were swinging on those chains and having a noisy good time. They were not the first ones who have done that; even their great-great-grandfathers had not been the first to do it when they were children. The strokes of the bare feet had worn grooves inches deep in the stone flags; it had taken many generations of swinging children to accomplish that.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{describe}} a new visual illusion first {{discovered in a}} natural setting. A cyclist riding beside a pair of <b>sagging</b> <b>chains</b> that connect fence posts appears to {{move up and down}} with the chains. In this illusion, a static shape (the chains) affects the perception of a moving shape (the bicycle), and this influence involves assimilation (averaging) rather than opposition (differentiation). These features distinguish the illusion from illusions of motion capture and induced motion. The authors take this bicycle illusion into the laboratory and report 4 findings: Naïve viewers experience the illusion when discriminating horizontal from sinusoidal motion of a disc in the context of stationary curved lines; the illusion shifts from motion assimilation to motion opposition as the visual size of the display is increased; the assimilation and opposition illusions are dissociated by variations in luminance contrast of the stationary lines and the moving disc; and the illusion does not occur when simply comparing two stationary objects at different locations along the curved lines. The bicycle illusion provides a unique opportunity for studying the interactions between shape and motion perception...|$|R
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of}} an unglycosylated T cell antigen receptor (TCR) beta chain {{has recently been}} determined to 1. 7 A resolution. To investigate whether this soluble beta chain (murine V beta 8. 2 J beta 2. 1 C beta 1) retains superantigen (SAG) -binding activity, we measured its affinity for various bacterial SAGs {{in the absence of}} MHC class II molecules. Dissociation constants (KDs) were determined using two independent techniques: surface plasmon resonance detection and sedimentation equilibrium. Specific binding was demonstrated to staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) B, C 1, C 2, and C 3 and to streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPEA), consistent with the known proliferative effects of these SAGs on T cells expressing V beta 8. 2. In contrast, SEA, which does not stimulate V beta 8. 2 -bearing cells, does not bind the recombinant beta chain. Binding of the beta <b>chain</b> to <b>SAGs</b> was characterized by extremely fast dissociation rates (> 0. 1 s- 1), similar to those reported for certain leukocyte adhesion molecules. Whereas the beta chain bound SEC 1, 2, and 3 with KDs of 0. 9 - 2. 5 microM, the corresponding value for SEB was approximately 140 microM. The much weaker binding to SEB than to SEC 1, 2, or 3 was surprising, especially since SEB was found to actually be 3 - to 10 -fold more effective, on a molar basis, than the other toxins in stimulating the parental T cell hybridoma. We interpret these results in terms of the ability of SEC to activate T cells independently of MHC, in contrast to SEB. We have also measured SE binding to the glycosylated form of the beta chain and found that carbohydrate apparently does not contribute to recognition, even though the N-linked glycosylation sites at V beta 8. 2 residues Asn 24 and Asn 74 are at or near the putative SAG-binding site. This result, along with the structural basis for the V beta specificity of SEs, are discussed in relation to the crystal structure of the unglycosylated beta chain...|$|R
