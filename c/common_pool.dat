5|$|Metropolitan Norway {{is divided}} into 27 police {{district}}s. Each district is further subdivided into local police stations and rural police districts, the latter led by a sheriff. Each police district is headquartered at a main police station and is led by a chief of police. Police districts hold a <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> of resources and personnel and have a common administration and budget. Each also has a joint operations center which also acts as an emergency call center for 112. Many of the larger districts have their own execution and enforcement authority, while this in integrated in the smaller districts. The size of the police districts varies, from Oslo with 2,500 employees and covering a population of 570,000 to Eastern Finnmark which has 160 employees and 30,000 residents.|$|E
5|$|Development of Lae as a port, on {{the other}} hand, was envisaged from the start; but when the town was captured, the port was blocked by sunken barges and debris. The only {{discharge}} facilities were two rickety jetties unable to hold trucks. The first cargo was delivered by LST, and brought ashore over the beach by DUKWs, LCMs and lighters. Australian and American DUKWs were operated as a <b>common</b> <b>pool.</b> Initially, the US Navy would only allow the LSTs to arrive at night, {{and they had to}} shove off before daybreak. Only in November did it allow them to operate in daylight. Sunken Japanese barges were cleared away by a 150-ton floating crane. American engineers then installed a floating dock, which was towed to Lae in sections. It opened on 20 October, and a Type C1 ship, the Cape Kreig, discharged there that day. A new dock was completed on 23 November, although it was used to unload the Liberty ship Fremont Older on 15 November. A fuel jetty was built, along with a bulk petroleum storage facility, and the first tanker discharged there on 20 November. A 4-inch pipeline was run through to Nadzab.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{payments}} are connected with marriage. Amobr, or commutation-fee, was a fee payable to the woman's lord on {{the loss of}} her virginity, whether on marriage or otherwise. Cowyll, or maiden-fee, was a payment due to the woman from her husband on the morning after the marriage, marking her transition from virgin to married woman. Dowry (agweddi) was the amount of the <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> of property owned by the couple which was due to the woman if the couple separated before the end of seven years. The total of the agweddi depended on the woman's status by birth, regardless of the actual size of the <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> of property. If the marriage broke up after the end of 7 years, the woman was entitled to half the <b>common</b> <b>pool.</b> The portion that was immediately accessible during the marriage, consisting usually of linens, dishes, and other domestic items, was known as argyvrau.|$|E
25|$|A third {{commonly}} used experiment used to demonstrate strong reciprocity preferences {{is the public}} goods game. In a public goods game, some number of participants are placed in a group.

In this game, for anyone trying to maximize their payoff, the rational nash equilibrium strategy is to not contribute anything. However, in a 2001 study, Fischbacher observed average contributions of 33.5%.|$|E

30|$|We {{performed}} panel regressions {{to properly}} account {{the heterogeneity of}} the data. Three regression models were tested to determine which of the model was applicable to use as trade policy model. The <b>common</b> <b>pooled</b> regression assumed that the regressors are non-stochastic or if stochastic are uncorrelated with the error term. It is also presumed that the error term satisfies the usual classical assumptions (Gujarati 2011). The results of the <b>common</b> <b>pooled</b> regression show that the accountability (ND) and FTA are significantly related to trade growth while the predictability (ER) is not significantly related to trade growth. The fixed effect model is estimated to cross-check the heterogeneity that may exist among the 255 observations. This model allows each country to have its individual intercept value. The term fixed effect {{is caused by the}} fact that while the intercept may differ across countries, the intercept does not vary over time that is it time invariant. This process is done by introducing differential intercept dummies. The dummies for the countries and the time are represented as D 2 –D 15 and T 16 –T 32, respectively. The exchange rate that represents predictability transparency exerts positive result and statistical significance on trade growth at 1 %, while the FTA exerts a negative result and statistical significance on trade growth at 5 %.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} understanding intellectual sharing/pooling arrangements {{and the construction of}} cultural commons arrangements. We argue that an adaptation of the approach pioneered by Elinor Ostrom and collaborators to commons arrangements in the natural environment may provide a template for the examination of constructed commons in the cultural environment. We thus argue in favor of an approach to understanding the institutional features of <b>commons</b> and <b>pooling</b> arrangements through case studies {{from a wide range of}} disciplines. Such an approach promises to lead to a better understanding of how participants in <b>commons</b> and <b>pooling</b> arrangements structure their interactions in relation to the environment(s) within which they are embedded and with which they share interdependent relationships. We propose a framework for evaluating the contours of different pooling arrangements with an eye toward developing an understanding of the structural differences across arrangements and industries as well as the underlying contextual reasons for such differences. Among other things, we argue that a theoretical approach to cultural constructed commons should consider rules pertaining to membership criteria, contribution and use of pooled resources, internal licensing conditions, management of external relationships, and institutional form along with the degree of collaboration among members, sharing of human capital, degrees of integration among participants, and whether there is a specified purpose to the arrangement.

25|$|The {{relatively}} small number of processors in early systems, allowed them to easily use a shared memory architecture, which allows processors to access a <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> of memory. In the early days a common approach was the use of uniform memory access (UMA), in which access time to a memory location was similar between processors. The use of non-uniform memory access (NUMA) allowed a processor to access its own local memory faster than other memory locations, while cache-only memory architectures (COMA) allowed for the local memory of each processor to be used as cache, thus requiring coordination as memory values changed.|$|E
25|$|Another {{application}} of strong reciprocity is in allocating {{property rights and}} ownership structure. Joint ownership of property can be {{very similar to the}} public goods game, where owners can independently contribute to the <b>common</b> <b>pool,</b> which then returns on the investment and is evenly distributed to all parties. This ownership structure is subject to the tragedy of the commons, in which if all the parties are self-interested, no one will invest. Alternatively, property could be allocated in an owner and employee relationship, in which an employee is hired by the owner and paid a specific wage for a specific level of investment. Experimental studies show that participants generally prefer joint ownership, and do better under joint ownership than in the owner employee organization.|$|E

Relevant examples for our line of reasoning are natural resources (i.e., the landscape water, biodiversity, traditional or wild landraces and so forth); also collective reputation in case this is connected to the production area (see above). When the reputation of the products is related to the place of origin, it acts as a CPR and requires collective management at local level.|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{insurance}} theory {{assumes that}} the parties involved assign subjective probabilities of losses. Here, we demonstrate that mutually beneficial risk-sharing is possible without the assignment of a probability - it is enough that the sharing parties presume that they {{are faced with the}} same probability.

An insurance industry with policies paid ex ante usually emerges first when considerable actuarial information is available.

2500|$|Strategic factors also {{matter in}} commons dilemmas. One often-studied {{strategic}} {{factor is the}} order in which people take harvests from the resource. In simultaneous play, all people harvest at the same time, whereas in sequential play people harvest from the pool according to a predetermined sequence– first, second, third, etc. There is a clear order effect in the latter games: the harvests of those who come first– the leaders– are higher than the harvest of those coming later– the followers. The interpretation of this effect is that the first players feel entitled to take more. With sequential play, individuals adopt a first come-first served rule, whereas with simultaneous play people may adopt an equality rule. Another strategic factor is the ability to build up reputations. Research [...] found that people take less from the <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> in public situations than in anonymous private situations.

[...] However, the unfortunate loss of HMS Dasher in March 1943 freed up a squadron's-worth of Swordfish aircraft and in June, just after Empire MacAlpine entered service, it was announced that No.836 Naval Air Squadron (NAS) was to relocate from Machrihanish to Belfast in Northern Ireland with nine aircraft as a core for the MAC ships, in addition to providing a <b>common</b> <b>pool</b> for the escort carriers.
