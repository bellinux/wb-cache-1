5|$|One type of {{piezoelectric}} transducer is the Langevin type, {{named after a}} transducer used by Paul Langevin in early sonar research. This is good for longitudinal modes of vibration. It {{can also be used}} on resonators with other modes of vibration if the motion can be mechanically converted into a longitudinal motion. The transducer consists of a layer of piezoelectric material sandwiched transversally into a <b>coupling</b> <b>rod</b> or resonator.|$|E
25|$|The {{piston rods}} {{connected}} {{to a pair of}} grasshopper beams (one for each cylinder) mounted above the boiler. A connecting rod near the piston end of the walking beams drove the rear axle's wheels, where it also {{connected to a}} <b>coupling</b> <b>rod</b> to drive the front wheels.|$|E
25|$|The {{eccentric}} crank (UK: return crank) (1) is rigidly {{attached to the}} con-rod pin connected to the main drive wheel. Note {{that this is the}} only suitable attachment point on any of the drive wheels that is not fouled by the passage of the <b>coupling</b> <b>rod</b> or the connecting rod. The {{eccentric crank}} is of a length such that the pin attachment to the eccentric rod (2) is 90 degrees out of phase with the lead motion.|$|E
50|$|Locomotion No 1 was {{the first}} {{locomotive}} to employ <b>coupling</b> <b>rods</b> rather than chains. In the 1930s reliable roller bearing <b>coupling</b> <b>rods</b> were developed.|$|R
25|$|No {{significant}} modifications {{were made to}} the design. The tank vent was found to restrict the driver's vision and was moved further forward from 80059. Initially built with fluted <b>coupling</b> <b>rods,</b> these caused problems on other classes and from 80079 plain section <b>coupling</b> <b>rods</b> were substituted.|$|R

500|$|Due to poorer quality track {{than was}} the norm in its native England, the {{locomotive}} had much trouble with derailment; the C's engineers added a leading truck (an assembly consisting of an unpowered axle with smaller diameter wheels that {{was connected to the}} frame and pushed in front of the locomotive) to help guide the engine into curves. [...] The leading truck's mechanism necessitated the removal of the <b>coupling</b> <b>rod</b> between the two main axles, leaving only the rear axle powered. Effectively, the John Bull became a 4-2-0 (a locomotive with two unpowered axles, one powered main axle, and no trailing axles). Later, the C also added a pilot ("cowcatcher") to the lead truck. [...] The cowcatcher is an angled assembly designed to deflect animals and debris off of the railroad track in front of the locomotive. To protect the locomotive's crew from the weather, the C also added walls and a roof (a cab) {{to the rear of the}} locomotive where the controls were located. C workshop crews also added safety features such as a bell and headlight.|$|E
2500|$|Construction {{was shared}} between the LSWR's Nine Elms Locomotive Works, London and Dübs and Company of Glasgow. Twenty were built at Nine Elms and 30 by Dübs. These were {{constructed}} between 1899 and 1900 and supplied with six wheel tenders. A second batch was ordered, and 15 more were constructed at Nine Elms, while a final, solitary example was constructed at Dübs and Company for the Glasgow Exhibition of 1901. Detail improvements on this final batch were a wider cab and revised wheel splasher that hid the 'throw' of the <b>coupling</b> <b>rod,</b> with cross-water tubes fitted into the firebox. This {{was an attempt}} to increase the heat surface area of the water, which was achieved, though at a cost in boiler complexity. This batch was also fitted with the Drummond [...] "watercart" [...] eight-wheel tender for longer running, whilst the previous was retrofitted with the design.|$|E
2500|$|SCOA-P wheels were {{developed}} in the late 1940s by the Steel Company of Australia Ltd (the P in the acronym standing for F. C. Paynter, who patented the design) in response to Victorian Railways experiencing fatigue problems with conventional spoked wheels. Stronger Boxpok type 'B' wheels had been installed {{on a number of}} VR locomotive classes in the late 1940s, but they had the disadvantage of being relatively heavy and also restricted maintenance access to axleboxes, underslung springs, and in some cases boiler washout plugs. Boxpok wheels were proposed for the forthcoming Victorian Railways R class 4-6-4, which had a relatively heavy [...] axle load, but it had been discovered that the use of a Boxpok wheel would make <b>coupling</b> <b>rod</b> pin removal difficult. The SCOA-P wheel was developed to allow the strength of the Boxpok design but also provide the maintenance access of a conventional spoked wheel.|$|E

50|$|On diesel and {{electric}} locomotives, the driving wheels may be directly {{driven by the}} traction motors. <b>Coupling</b> <b>rods</b> are not usually used, and it is quite common for each axle {{to have its own}} motor. Jackshaft drive and <b>coupling</b> <b>rods</b> were used in the past (e.g. in the Swiss Crocodile locomotive) but their use is now confined to shunting locomotives.|$|R
50|$|Two motors were {{mounted in}} each bogie frame. The motors drove large cogwheels via {{spring-loaded}} sprockets on each side, and the cogwheels drove a jackshaft. The crank pins of the jackshafts drove - via a <b>coupling</b> <b>rod</b> - the crank pins {{of the two}} outer drive axles of the bogie. The inner side of this <b>coupling</b> <b>rod</b> contained a pin, which drove the crank pins of the two inner drive axles via a second <b>coupling</b> <b>rod.</b> Because {{of the position of}} the motors, and therefore also the jackshaft, the coupling rods were offset slightly relative to the drive axles. From a maintenance point of view this kind of drive was cheaper than a complex split <b>coupling</b> <b>rod,</b> but during service it was considerably more bumpy. For this reason primarily, the locomotive was not used for high speed operation.|$|E

50|$|The two motors were {{mounted in}} half height in the {{locomotive}} frame. Those two motors drove big cogwheels over sprockets spring-loaded on both sides. Each {{of those big}} cogwheels drove a jackshaft. The two jackshafts drove a shared slit <b>coupling</b> <b>rod</b> which drove - over a vertical crosshead - the crank pin of the center drive-axle. Side rods connected to the slit <b>coupling</b> <b>rod</b> transmitted the force to the outer drive-wheels.This drive concept was later used at the Ae 3/6 II.|$|E
50|$|Two motors were {{mounted in}} each bogie frame. They were located between {{the second and}} third drive-axle. The motors drove big cogwheels in the {{jackshaft}} over spring-loaded sprockets. The crank pin of the jackshaft drove over inclined connecting rod a pin mounted on the triangle-shaped <b>coupling</b> <b>rod</b> which connected the first and the second drive-axle. This pin was located close to the crank pin of the first drive-axle. A second <b>coupling</b> <b>rod</b> connected the second and the third drive-axles. This drive is known as Winterthurer Schrägstangenantrieb (Winterthur drive with inclined connecting rod).|$|E

50|$|The <b>coupling</b> <b>rod's</b> off-center {{attachment}} to the crank pin of the driving wheel inevitably creates an eccentric movement and vibration when in motion. To compensate for this, the driving wheels of an inside-frame locomotive always had built-in counterweights to offset the angular momentum of the <b>coupling</b> <b>rods,</b> {{as shown in the}} figures above. On outside-frame locomotives, the counterweight could be on the driving wheel itself, or it could be on the crank outside the frame, as shown in the adjacent figure.|$|R
2500|$|The B class {{locomotives}} {{were easily}} recognisable by {{their use of}} external frames and bearings, and <b>coupling</b> <b>rods</b> mounted outside the frames, earning them the nickname [...] "overarmers".|$|R
50|$|A {{difficulty}} with <b>coupling</b> <b>rod</b> drive from a jackshaft {{is the need}} to allow for vertical suspension movement of the axles. Several mechanical arrangements have been used to allow this.|$|E
50|$|The {{two-cylinder}} {{wet steam}} engine {{was on the}} outside. The cylinders set horizontally and drive the <b>coupling</b> <b>rod</b> on the first axle. The steam chests were, like the Stephenson valve gear, on the inside.|$|E
50|$|These {{locomotives}} were articulated, {{with one}} large traction motor {{on each of}} the two bogies at each end. The jackshaft was thus placed above and between the driving wheels. To maximise the length of its drive rod and reduce its angulation, this was connected near to the furthest driven axle. The <b>coupling</b> <b>rod</b> between those axles was 'triangular', with an additional bearing mounted on its top edge, taking the thrust of the jackshaft drive rod. Unlike most connecting rods, this allows it to be mounted in the same plane as the <b>coupling</b> <b>rod</b> bearings. This reduces the overhung lengths of the crankpins and their bending loads.|$|E
50|$|The locomotive's {{mechanical}} transmission {{consisted of a}} single, frame-mounted traction motor powering a jackshaft drive via a reduction gear; the jackshaft drove all three driving axles via connecting <b>rod</b> and <b>coupling</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Apart {{from the}} Drummond tubes, the {{locomotives}} {{differed from the}} Class 8-L1 in a few particulars. Their <b>coupling</b> <b>rods</b> were [...] "H" [...] section instead of rectangular, while their crank pins were slightly larger.|$|R
50|$|A 2-6-2 {{high-pressure}} locomotive of 1927, designed by Buchli. This used a three-cylinder motor {{to drive the}} wheels through a 1:2.5 reduction gearbox, then conventional <b>coupling</b> <b>rods.</b> This motor had poppet valves and uniflow admission.|$|R
50|$|A <b>coupling</b> <b>rod</b> or {{side rod}} connects the driving wheels of a locomotive. Steam {{locomotives}} in particular usually have them, but some diesel and electric locomotives, especially older ones and shunters, also have them. The coupling rods transfer {{the power to}} all driving wheels.|$|E

50|$|Two motors were {{mounted in}} both bogie frames. Those two motors drove big cogwheels over both-side {{spring-loaded}} sprockets. The big cogwheels drove a jackshaft. The jackshaft drove a slit <b>coupling</b> <b>rod</b> which drove - over a vertical crosshead - the crank pins {{of the two}} drive-axles of the bogie.|$|E
50|$|Initially, <b>coupling</b> <b>rods</b> {{were made}} of steel. As {{technology}} progressed and better materials became available, the connecting rods were manufactured of lighter and stronger alloys, which in turn permitted smaller counterweights and also reduced hammering.|$|R
50|$|Between the 1950s and 1960s the frames, {{wheels and}} <b>coupling</b> <b>rods</b> of several Class 835 {{locomotives}} {{were used in}} building 40 Class E.321 and 20 Class E.322 electric shunting locomotives, and 29 Class D.234 diesel-hydraulic shunters.|$|R
50|$|By the 1950s the SLNCR's {{locomotive}} livery was unlined black. Brasswork {{was also}} painted black but the borders and lettering of the locomotive nameplate were picked out in red. <b>Coupling</b> <b>rods</b> and buffer beams were also painted red.|$|R
