50|$|Modern Chinese knives {{are sold}} under three general classifications {{throughout}} China: Caidao (slicers), <b>choppers</b> and Gudao (cleavers). The general distinction {{lies in the}} thickness of the blade. <b>Choppers</b> are the most common all-purpose Chinese knife. <b>Choppers</b> have thicker blades than slicers but are not as thick and heavy as cleavers. <b>Choppers</b> are used for slicing, chopping and mincing meat, vegetables and herbs. <b>Choppers</b> are suitable for chopping through thin soft bones such as fish and poultry. Slicers, referred to as Caidao (vegetable knives) by the Chinese have the thinnest and sharpest blades. Slicers may have the same shape as <b>choppers</b> or they may have less width and appear similar to Japanese Nakiri knives. Slicers are used for cutting vegetables, mincing herbs and slicing thin strips of meat for stir frying. The thin blade makes slicers unsuitable for chopping any bones. Cleavers, which are referred to as bone <b>choppers</b> by the Chinese have thick heavy blades. In Chinese homes, cleavers are typically used for chopping up pork ribs or for preparing hard-shelled seafood such as lobsters.|$|R

5|$|Torque {{generated}} by the drive causes the induction motor to run at synchronous speed less the slip. If the load drives the motor faster than synchronous speed, the motor acts as a generator, converting mechanical power back to electrical power. This power is returned to the drive's DC link element (capacitor or reactor). A DC-link-connected electronic power switch or braking DC <b>chopper</b> controls dissipation of this power as heat {{in a set of}} resistors. Cooling fans may be used to prevent resistor overheating.|$|E
