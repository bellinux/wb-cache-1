The Do 17P-1 was powered by two BMW 132N radial engines {{with a maximum}} performance of 865PS (853hp, 636kW) each. The machine was fitted with several radio variations. The FuG IIIaU radio (Funkgerät), the PeilG V direction finder (PeilG - Peilgerät) and the FuBI 1 radio blind-landing device (FuBI - Funkblindlandegerät). The crew of three <b>communicated</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> other via the EiV intercom (EiV -Eigenverständigungsanlage). The P-1 was equipped with either Rb 20/30 and Rb 50/30 or Rb 20/18 and Rb 50/18 cameras. The P-1/trop was fitted with filters and protection for the cameras. The cameras were controlled remotely by the crew from the cockpit.|$|E

2500|$|The ancient Chamorro {{society had}} four classes: chamorri (chiefs), matua (upper class), achaot (middle class), and mana'chang (lower class). The matua {{were located in}} the coastal villages, which meant they had the best access to fishing grounds, whereas the mana'chang were located in the {{interior}} of the island. Matua and mana'chang rarely <b>communicated</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> other, and matua often used achaot as intermediaries. There were also [...] "makåhna" [...] (similar to shamans), skilled in healing and medicine. Belief in spirits of ancient Chamorros called [...] "Taotao mo'na" [...] still persists as a remnant of pre-European culture. Their society was organized along matrilineal clans.|$|E
2500|$|During the 20th century, liberal ideas spread {{even further}} as liberal democracies found {{themselves}} on the winning side in both world wars. Historian Martin Conway argues: [...] "Liberalism, liberal values and liberal institutions formed {{an integral part of}} that process of European consolidation. Fifteen {{years after the end of}} the Second World War, the liberal and democratic identity of Western Europe had been reinforced on almost all sides by the definition of the West as a place of freedom. Set against the oppression in the Communist East, by the slow development of a greater understanding of the moral horror of Nazism, and by the engagement of intellectuals and others with the new states (and social and political systems) emerging in the non-European world to the South". As a consequence, liberal values were acquiring a wider currency, transcending the limited contours of liberal parties and electorates, thus becoming part of how West Europeans recognize and <b>communicated</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> other.|$|E

So that no communication could possibly have passed between his wife and himself from the first moment that he believed her dead {{on the night of the}} fire, to the day of his wedding.

60|$|Passing at once, therefore, {{to the one}} {{consideration}} of any importance, I endeavored {{to find out whether}} Mr. Gracedieu and Mrs. Tenbruggen had met, or had <b>communicated</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> other in any way, during the long period of separation that had taken place between the Minister and myself. If he had been so unlucky as to offend her, she was beyond all doubt an enemy to be dreaded. Apart, however, from a misfortune of this kind, she would rank, in my opinion, with the other harmless objects of Mr. Gracedieu's distrust.|$|E

The only doubt seemed {{to be about the}} safety of those tubs which had been left under the church gallery-stairs, and after a short discussion {{at the corner of the}} mill, it was agreed that these should be removed before it got lighter, and hidden in the middle of a double hedge bordering the adjoining field. However, before anything could be carried into effect, the footsteps of many men were heard coming down the lane from the highway.|$|E
60|$|Although {{there was}} a good deal of bad feeling between the Indians and the whites at that time, they still traded and <b>communicated</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> other; and when, in the course of time, it became known in New Amsterdam that {{there was a}} white woman held as a {{prisoner}} in this Indian camp, there was every reason to suppose that this woman was the young wife who had been left on the seacoast by the survivors of the wreck. Consequently some of the men who had been her fellow-passengers came over to the Indian camp, which was not far from where Middletown now stands. Here, as they had expected, they found Penelope, and demanded that the Indians should give her up.|$|E

Some fine old engravings from the grand landscapes of Claude (part of a collection of prints possessed by Miss Ladd's father) hung on the walls. The carpet was in harmony with the curtains; and the furniture was of light-colored wood, which helped the general effect of subdued brightness that made the charm of the room.

It rained in torrents {{during the night}} of the 13th and the fore part of the day of the 14th. The roads were intolerable, and in some places on Sherman's line, where the land was low, they were covered more than a foot deep with water. But the troops never murmured. By nine o'clock Crocker, of McPherson's corps, who was now in advance, came upon the enemy's pickets and speedily drove them in upon the main body. They were outside of the intrenchments in a strong position, and proved to be the troops that had been driven out of Raymond. Johnston had been reinforced; during the night by Georgia and South Carolina regiments, so that his force amounted to eleven thousand men, and he was expecting still more.|$|E
60|$|No {{sooner had}} Lucy's solemn tones ceased than I {{passed through the}} crowd of weeping and still {{kneeling}} blacks, and entered my sister's room. Grace was reclining in an easy chair; her eyes closed, her hands clasped together, but lying on her knees, and her whole attitude and air proclaiming a momentary but total abstraction of the spirit. I do not think she heard my footstep at all, and I stood at her side an instant, uncertain whether {{to let her know}} of my presence, or not. At this instant I caught the eye of Lucy, who seemed intent on the wish to speak to me. Grace had three or four small rooms that <b>communicated</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> other, in her part of the dwelling; and into one of these, which served as a sort of boudoir, though the name was then unknown in America, I followed the dear girl, whose speaking but sad look had bidden me do so.|$|E
6000|$|Frances smiled, but averted her face, while Sarah moved, {{with the}} grace of an {{offended}} Juno, from the apartment. Her own room, however, afforded her but little relief, and in passing through the long gallery that <b>communicated</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> of the chambers of the building, she noticed the door of Singleton's room to be open. The wounded youth seemed sleeping, and was alone. She had ventured lightly into the apartment, and busied herself {{for a few minutes}} in arranging the tables, and the nourishment provided for the patient, hardly conscious of what she was doing, and possibly dreaming that these little feminine offices were performed for another. Her natural bloom was heightened by the insinuation of the surgeon, nor was the luster of her eye in any degree diminished. The sound of the approaching footsteps of Sitgreaves hastened her retreat down a private stairway, to the side of her sister. The sisters then sought the fresh air on the piazza; and as they pursued their walk, arm in arm, the following dialogue took place:-- ...|$|E

6000|$|Two salons, one {{looking to}} the front of the house, and the other to the back, <b>communicated</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> other by folding-doors, which were now wide open. Santerre, the Marquis, Denot, Agatha, and the other republican officer, were in the back room; the unfortunate wretches doomed to die were {{collected}} on the gravel before the windows of the front room; the carabineers who were to fire on them stood in a double file on the broad area before the front door, and above the steps. Santerre, on being addressed by the sergeant, stalked into the front room to give the order; his altered face plainly shewed the strong passion which was at work within his heart. As he passed from one room to the other, he threw his cap upon the ground, and trampled on it; then clenched his fist, and bit his lip till the blood ran. The fatal word [...] "Fire" [...] was on his tongue; but, without intending it, he looked through the window, and his eyes fell on the wretched creatures who were expecting death, and he was unable to give the command. He sank back upon a chair, and hiding his face in both his hands, he said to the sergeant, in a low voice: ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the mean}} time, the watch and ward held over Mary was more strict and {{rigorous}} than ever, her keepers being resolved to double their vigilance, while George and William, {{on the other}} hand, resolved to redouble their exertions to find some means to circumvent it. William, who was only a boy of seventeen, and who remained within the castle, acted his part in a very sagacious and admirable manner. He was silent, and assumed a thoughtless and unconcerned manner in his general deportment, which put every one off their guard in respect to him. George, who was at Kinross, held frequent communications with the Hamilton lords, encouraging them to hope for Mary's escape, and leading them to continue in combination, and {{to be ready to}} act at a moment's warning. They <b>communicated</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> other, too, by secret means, across the lake, and with Mary in her solitary tower.

60|$|There {{were still}} {{four hours of}} {{daylight}} after they had finished their meal, so they went out with Dias to explore one of the numerous burying- grounds round the village. It consisted of sunken chambers. In these were bones, with remains of the mats in which the bodies had been clothed. These wrappings resembled small sacks, and they remarked that the people must have been of very small size, or they could never have been packed away in them. With them had been buried many of the implements of their trade. One or two had apparently not been opened. Here were knitting utensils, toilet articles, implements for weaving, spools of thread, needles of bone and bronze. With {{the body of a}} girl had been placed a kind of work-box, containing the articles that she had used, and the mummy of a parrot, some beads, and fragments of an ornament of silver. Dias told them that all these tombs were made long before the coming of the Incas. He said that round the heads of the men and boys were wound the slings they had used in life, while a piece of cotton flock was wrapped round the heads of the women. Many of the graves <b>communicated</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> other by very narrow passages; the purpose of these was not clear, but probably they were made to enable the spirits of the dead to meet and hold communion with each other.|$|E
