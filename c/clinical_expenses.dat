The losses due to mastitis in monetary terms were estimated to be INR 1390 per lactation, among which around 49 % was owing to loss of value from milk and 37 % on account of veterinary expenses. Higher losses were observed in crossbred cows due to their high production potential that was affected during mastitis period. The cost of treating an animal was estimated to be INR 509 which includes cost of medicine (31. 10 %) and services (5. 47 %).

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} report is to identify and quantify the cost drivers of three district hospitals in the Western Cape, namely Knysna Hospital, Oudtshoorn Hospital and Mossel Bay Hospital, and to simultaneously measure value-driven performance indicators. An environmental scan identified various driving forces that would significantly affect change in the healthcare industry such as the brain drain of health professionals, consumerism and cost containment and efficiency initiatives. The Department of Health’s understanding of the eighth Batho Pele principle of value for money is generally understood as providing quality health care within prescribed cost limits. An attempt is made to establish {{the effect of the}} quadruple burden of disease (the HIV/AIDS pandemic, persistent infectious diseases, injury arising from violence and road traffic collisions and emerging chronic conditions) on hospital expenditure in the Eden District. Research identified Mossel Bay as a high TB burden area known as a TB “hotspot” and it is a recognized immigration transit point en route to Cape Town. The population analyses revealed that Mossel Bay is the growth point of the Eden District, showing extraordinary growth of 25 % between 2007 and 2009. Personnel costs: This study revealed that personnel costs are responsible for {{the overwhelming majority of the}} total expenditure of the district hospitals. Staff numbers, occupation specific dispensation (OSD) implementation and annual wage negotiations are the cost drivers of personnel costs. This study also found a clear correlation between an over-expenditure in personnel expenses and over-expenditure in the total expenditure of all three hospitals. Health care costs: Expenditure on blood products is considered a major cost driver of <b>clinical</b> <b>expenses.</b> Laboratory expenditure is clearly the largest cost driver for <b>clinical</b> <b>expenses</b> at all three hospitals. Together with laboratory expenses, medicine and medical supplies are the cost drivers for <b>clinical</b> <b>expenses.</b> Costs not related to health care: The three most significant administrative expenses are communication, stationery and printing as well as travel and subsistence allowances. The cost driver for subsistence and travel expenses is the number of vehicles followed by the preference of vehicle, which in turn determines the daily tariff and the kilometre tariff. This study revealed that Knysna Municipality has the cheapest electricity cost of the three towns. It is clear that cost and consumption of electricity and water are the two variables that affect municipal service expenditure the most. Equity: When the district hospital expenditure is combined with the primary health care expenditure in the three sub-districts, the figures show that Oudtshoorn is spending 3 % more than its equitable share of the total budget at a higher cost of R 978 per capita, in excess of R 100 above the district average. Efficiency: The cost per patient day equivalent (PDE) per economic classification for all three hospitals is less than the average cost per PDE of the district hospitals in the Western Cape. The cost/PDE of Oudtshoorn Hospital is considerably higher than that of Knysna and Mossel Bay in all economic classifications, with the single exception of the agency cost of Mossel Bay Hospital. The cost of health care always reflects a combination of price, quantity and value, and it is impossible to consider individual cost drivers in isolation. Several cost-saving initiatives and managerial control measures are recommended...|$|E

40|$|Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a {{heterogeneous}} syndrome with several causative factors. Autoimmune mechanisms {{are involved in}} pathogenesis of 4 - 30 % of POF cases. The present review focuses {{on the role of}} autoimmunity in the pathophysiology of POF. The evidences for an autoimmune etiology are: demonstration of ovarian autoantibodies, the presence of lymphocytic oophoritis, and association with other autoimmune disorders. Several ovarian antigenic targets have been identified in POF patients. The oocyte seems to be the most often targeted cell. Lymphocytic oophoritis is widely present in POF associated adrenal insufficiency. Addisons ۥ disease {{is one of the most}} common autoimmune disorders associated with POF. Early detection of this potentially life threatening disease was recommended in several studies. The gold standard for detecting autoimmune POF is ovarian biopsy. This procedure is not recommended due to unknown <b>clinical</b> value, <b>expense,</b> and risks. Several immunoassays have been proposed as substitute diagnostic tools. Nevertheless, ther...|$|R

40|$|Taking {{the course}} of {{clinical}} practice is important for students under training of the physical therapy and the occupational therapy. Because the hospital affiliated with Gunma University has no course for clinical practice of rehabilitation, students educated under rehabilitation in our college are obliged to take their training course both {{in public and private}} institutions. However, institutions with rehabilitaion are few in Gunma prefecture. Then, students must get the institutions outside the prefecture far from out college. In the cource of the <b>clinical</b> practice, living <b>expense</b> of students runs-up when their training course does outside the prefecture. The living expense is about twice (about 260, 000 Japanese yen) outside the prefecture than inside. Moreover, the students who could not settle their apartment in public survice outside the prefecture are obliged to pay far great expense. Students suffer from both their big living expense and quite a distant from our college at the clinical training in rehabilitaion. This prevents students from thier effective education progress on rehabilitaioin. The reasones as mentioned above, it will be said that the hospital affiliated with Gunma University should pay, as possible as, the effort to settle {{the course of}} clinical parctice for rehabilitaition...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundRemote {{monitoring}} (RM) {{of cardiac}} implantable electronic devices {{has been demonstrated}} to improve outpatient clinic workflow and patient management. However, few data {{are available on the}} socioeconomic impact of RM. ObjectiveThe aim {{of this study was to}} assess the costs and benefits of RM compared with standard care (SC). MethodsWe used 12 -month patient data from the Health Economics Evaluation Registry for Remote Follow-up (TARIFF) study (N = 209; RM: n = 102 (48. 81 %); SC: n = 107 (51. 19 %)). Cost comparison was made from 2 perspectives: the health care system (HCS) and patients. The use of health care resources was defined on the basis of hospital <b>clinical</b> folders. Out-of-pocket <b>expenses</b> were reported directly by patients. ResultsHCS perspective: The overall mean annual cost per patient in the SC group (€ 1044. 89 ± € 1990. 47) was significantly higher than in the RM group (€ 482. 87 ± € 2488. 10) (P <. 0001), with a reduction of 53. 87 % being achieved in the RM group. The primary driver of cost reduction was the cost of cardiovascular hospitalizations (SC: €` 886. 67 ± € 1979. 13 vs RM: € 432. 34 ± € 2488. 10; P =. 0030). Patient and caregiver perspective: The annual cost incurred by patients was significantly higher in the SC group than in the RM group (SC: € 169. 49 ± € 189. 50 vs RM: € 56. 87 ± € 80. 22; P <. 0001). Patients’ quality-adjusted life-years were not significantly different between the groups. Provider perspective: The total number of inhospital device follow-up visits was reduced by 58. 78 % in the RM group. ConclusionRM of patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) is cost saving from the perspectives of the HCS, patients, and caregivers. Introducing appropriate reimbursements will make RM sustainable even for the provider, i. e. the hospitals which provide the service and encourage widespread adoption of RM...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Clopidogrel is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} and prevention of peripheral vascular, cerebrovascular, and coronary artery diseases. This clinical trial was designed to demonstrate that clopidogrel napadisilate (CN) is not inferior to clopidogrel bisulfate (CB) with respect to its effectiveness in inhibiting platelet aggregation. Methods: This 4 week multi-center, prospective, open-label, randomized trial was conducted at five clinical centers in South Korea. Patients were randomized into the 75 mg CN group or the 75 mg CB group. Platelet aggregation was assessed by the VerifyNow assay. The primary outcome was the difference of the percentage P 2 Y(12) inhibition and the secondary outcome was the baseline and change in P 2 Y(12) reaction units (PRU). Results: There {{was no significant difference}} in the percentage P 2 Y(12) inhibition (CN vs. CB, 34. 92 +/- 21. 33 % vs. 30. 43 +/- 17. 90 %, p = 0. 203). The mean difference of the percentage P 2 Y(12) inhibition between groups was 4. 49 %, their two-sided 95 % confidence interval was - 2. 45 % to 11. 44 %, and the lower bound (- 2. 45 %) was greater than the acceptable non-inferiority margin of - 9. 0 %. The baseline PRU was 96. 67 +/- 76. 76 in the CN group and 216. 95 +/- 68. 86 in the CB group (p = 0. 121), and the change in the PRU was - 3. 32 +/- 51. 71 in the CN group and 10. 52 +/- 43. 31 in the CB group (p = 0. 106). Four subjects experienced AEs (6. 3 %, 5 events) in the CN group and 7 subjects (11. 11 %, 13 events) in the CB group without statistical significance (p = 0. 364). With respect to serious adverse events, 2 events were reported in 2 subjects, 1 in each group. Conclusion: Clopidogrel napadisilate was not inferior to clopidogrel bisulfate in terms of antiplatelet efficacy and tolerability, and there were no clinically significant adverse events.
