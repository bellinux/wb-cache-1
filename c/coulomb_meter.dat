The next experiment tried was the <b>Coulomb</b> <b>meter</b> experiment. Second Half. Determination of the value of e [the particle or unit of electricity]. Then radioactivity was studied.

50|$|Polarization density also {{describes}} how a material responds to an applied electric field {{as well as}} the way the material changes the electric field, and can be used to calculate the forces that result from those interactions. It can be compared to magnetization, which is the measure of the corresponding response of a material to a magnetic field in magnetism. The SI unit of measure is <b>coulombs</b> per square <b>meter,</b> and polarization density is represented by a vector P.|$|R
40|$|For close {{proximity}} flying {{on the order}} of 10 – 100 <b>meters,</b> <b>Coulomb</b> thrusting presents a promising alternative to other methods of propulsion. This clean and fuel-efficient propulsion method is being investigated for use in formation flying and virtual structures. In the latter application, the individual spacecraft assume fixed positions relative to each other through the use of Coulomb forces. In the work presented here, an analytical and numerical analysis is performed on such virtual structures. In the analytical portion, the constant, open-loop charges necessary to maintain a Hill-frame-static formation are determined for the cases of linear two- and three-spacecraft formations and for the case of equilateral triangular formations with spacecraft of equal mass. In addition, analysis is provided for the N-craft case so that the inter-craft charge products can be determined for any static formation. In the numerical portion, a genetic algorithm is employed to support the analytical results by determining formation geometries and charging schemes such that the formation craft remain static in the Hill frame in the absence of perturbation. The results of the numerical analysis include examples of static two-craft through nine-craft formations, including several formations that display a broader range of configurations than considered in previous works...|$|R
