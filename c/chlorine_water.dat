50|$|The name {{given to}} water {{attained}} {{from around the}} Osenberge, know {{to be one of}} the purest sources of spring water in all of Germany.

50|$|PoCl2 dissolves in dilute {{hydrochloric}} acid {{to give a}} pink solution, which autoxidises to Po(IV). PoCl2 is rapidly oxidised by hydrogen peroxide or <b>chlorine</b> <b>water.</b> Addition of potassium hydroxide to the pink solution results in a dark brown precipitate - possibly hydrated PoO or Po(OH)2 - which is rapidly oxidised to Po(IV). With dilute nitric acid, PoCl2 forms a dark red solution followed by a flaky white precipitate of unknown composition.|$|E
50|$|STCs for nonpotable {{pool water}} use are often made of plastic. Pool water is mildly {{corrosive}} due to <b>chlorine.</b> <b>Water</b> {{is circulated through}} the panels using the existing pool filter or supplemental pump. In mild environments, unglazed plastic collectors are more efficient as a direct system. In cold or windy environments evacuated tubes or flat plates in an indirect configuration are {{used in conjunction with}} a heat exchanger. This reduces corrosion. A fairly simple differential temperature controller is used to direct the water to the panels or heat exchanger either by turning a valve or operating the pump. Once the pool water has reached the required temperature, a diverter valve is used to return water directly to the pool without heating. Many systems are configured as drainback systems where the water drains into the pool when the water pump is switched off.|$|E

50|$|This type of {{urticaria}} is also termed rare, and occurs upon {{contact with}} water. The response is not temperature-dependent {{and the skin}} appears similar to cholinergic form of the disease. The appearance of hives is within one to 15 minutes of contact with the water, and can last from 10 minutes to two hours. This kind of hives {{do not seem to}} be stimulated by histamine discharge like the other physical hives. Most researchers believe this condition is actually skin sensitivity to additives in the water, such as <b>chlorine.</b> <b>Water</b> urticaria is diagnosed by dabbing tap water and distilled water to the skin and observing the gradual response. Aquagenic urticaria is treated with capsaicin (Zostrix) administered to the chafed skin. This is the same treatment used for shingles. Antihistamines are of questionable benefit in this instance, since histamine is not the causative factor.|$|E

50|$|Other {{components}} of the works included a Carr's disintegrator which crushed glass to add to filter vats of fine damped sand through which chlorine gas was passed, then <b>chlorine</b> <b>water</b> was added from above to dissolve out the gold. Eight precipitating vats, each about 3m in diameter by 1m deep, were used to precipitate gold from solutions. The precipitate was burnt in a reverberatory furnace, leaving the ash and gold to be smelted, or sometimes the gold was redissolved and precipitated, after which it was smelted. With the advance of cyanide treatment technology, introduced commercially to Charters Towers by the Australian Gold Recovery Company in 1892, the low cost of handling and treating sands and slimes and the utter simplicity of the new process, meant that the chlorination works, once so prosperous, became redundant and were shut down. The Forrest-McArthur cyanidation process of treating mill tailings was perfected by 1895. In 1899 there were 96 cyaniding plants in Charters Towers. That was the year of peak gold production - 319,572 fine ozs.|$|E

Results were as follows :　 1 Fibers treated with saturated <b>chlorine</b> <b>water,</b> even within ten minutes at room temperature, were well dyed with basic dye (Chrysoidine). According to elementary analysis, chlorine atom was found in the reacted fiber (0. 93 %), but it was decreased to 0. 32 % by boiling for 30 minutes in 5 % KOH solution, afterwhich the dyeability was lost. The colour of well dyed fiber was orange and that of hard dyed one was light-orange. It was supposed that a small amount of hydrochloric acid had penetrated into the fiber and made a salt with Chrysoidine. 　 2 A dyeability of fibers treated with chlorine gas was decreased to half the one which was treated with saturated <b>chlorine</b> <b>water.</b> 　It was further decreased on the fiber treated with dried chlorine gas. The colour of the fiber was light yellow and Cl atom was found in it (0. 18 %). lts dyeability was lost after boiling for 20 minutes in 5 % KOH solution, thereafter it was unable to confirm the existence of Chlorine in the fiber even by flame reaction...|$|E
