Bob Ayling's management faced strike action by <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> over a £1 billion cost-cutting drive to return BA to profitability in 1997; this was the last time BA <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> would strike until 2009, although staff morale has reportedly been unstable since that incident. In an effort to increase interaction between management, employees, and the unions, various conferences and workshops have taken place, often with thousands in attendance.|$|E
5|$|During {{its final}} flight, the {{aircraft}} was carrying 144 passengers, two pilots, and four <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> members {{from at least}} 18 countries—mostly Germany and Spain. The count was confused by the multiple citizenship status of some people on board.|$|E
5|$|The Hong Kong-route {{was officially}} opened on 5 August 1949. Braathens SAFE had then moved its {{operative}} base from Gardermoen to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The company stationed technical employees in Rome, Karachi, Bangkok and Hong Kong, {{as well as}} having an agreement with KLM. The planes would stop each night and crew and passengers would stay at a hotel. <b>Cabin</b> <b>crew</b> had no training, and learned the job as they worked. Chicken {{was the most common}} lunch meal, and the <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> had to purchase this fresh each day, usually observing the slaughter to ensure its freshness. In 1949, sixty-seven flights were made to Hong Kong, as well as two to Tokyo, to Venezuela and one to Johannesburg.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Boeing {{introduced}} overhead crew rests as {{an option}} on the 777. Located above the main cabin and connected via staircases, the forward flight crew rest contains two seats and two bunks, while the aft <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> rest features multiple bunks. The Signature Interior has since been adapted for other Boeing wide-body and narrow-body aircraft, including 737NG, 747-400, 757-300, and newer 767 models, including all 767-400ER models. The 747-8 and 767-400ER have also adopted the larger, more rounded windows of the original 777.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, British Airways {{took over}} British Midland International (BMI) which {{gave them a}} {{monopoly}} on UK mainland flights from Heathrow. In order for the deal to be completed, the European Union Competition Commissioner decreed that BA {{would have to give}} up 14 of BMI's landing slots at Heathrow to comply with EU competition regulations. 12 of these slots were set aside for domestic usage, which were bought by Virgin Atlantic after they outbid Aer Lingus for the required British domestic operating licence. Virgin announced that they would set up Virgin Atlantic Little Red as a subsidiary to use these slots to cover domestic UK mainland routes as Aer Lingus already provided competition for BA on flights to Northern Ireland from Heathrow. Little Red was later revealed to be operated on a wet-lease by Aer Lingus whereby the planes would be operated by Aer Lingus but would bear Virgin Atlantic livery. The pilots would be employed by Aer Lingus, with <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> supplied by McGinley Aviation. The <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> would wear Virgin Little Red uniforms and had training from Virgin, despite the fact that airline had not previously operated narrow-body aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Keč hijacked the {{aircraft}} with 122 passengers and {{a crew of}} six in mid-air after leaving Bardufoss. The aircraft landed as scheduled at Bodø, where all women, children and seniors were let off, along {{with two of the}} <b>cabin</b> <b>crew.</b> The aircraft then departed Bodø with 77 passengers and a crew of four. It was diverted to Gardermoen, where Keč made his demands. He surrendered at about 21:00, seven hours after take-off from Bardufoss, after some of his demands had been met. He was sentenced to four years prison for the incident.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 2016, Jet Airways flight 9W7083 from Bhopal to Mumbai {{was held}} up by {{a large group of}} {{passengers}} headed for a marriage in Mumbai. There were allegations from other passengers that the wedding party was politically connected and attempted to coerce the <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> to disembark passengers, so that additional members of their party could be accommodated. The airline claimed it was a technical glitch in their booking system which led to overbooking.|$|E
5|$|The 'Best' and 'Back' {{service was}} highly criticized by analysts and customers. Braathens SAFE {{had a strong}} image, and unlike SAS, that was branded as 'The Businessman's Airline', Braathens SAFE {{was seen as the}} people's airline. It also drew {{goodwill}} from being Norwegian-owned, and that it displayed the Flag of Norway on the tailplane. Prior to the rebranding, no airline in Norway had ever operated a two-class service on domestic flights—including SAS. Professor of Sociology Per Morten Schiefloe commented that the introduction of segregation of passengers offended passengers. Customers who previously had been paying full price, became more aware of the savings on using 'Back' tickets. At the same time, people who wanted to travel with discounted tickets felt that they got better service and were not treated as second-rate customers with SAS. This caused Braathens to lose customers at both ends. The rebranding itself not only cost money to initiate, but also increased operating expenses, because <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> needed to move the curtain depending on the number of passengers on each class. Planes were sometimes delayed for hours, particularly {{in the beginning of the}} service, due to the increased work load on the handling and <b>cabin</b> <b>crew.</b>|$|E

5|$|Flight 2801 was a {{chartered}} flight {{flown by}} Vnukovo Airlines {{on behalf of}} Arktikugol, which operated mines at the two company towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden in Svalbard. The aircraft was a Tupolev Tu-154M, with registration RA-85621, serial number 86A 742 and date of manufacture 14 January 1987. The flight consisted of a crew of eleven, including a cockpit crew of four (two aircraft pilots, one engineer and one navigator), a <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> of five and two technicians. The pilot in command (PiC) had previously landed at Svalbard Airport; the first officer had not and was the piloting pilot.|$|E
5|$|JALways {{became a}} wholly owned {{subsidiary}} of Japan Airlines on March 9, 2001 through {{an exchange of}} shares. The change in ownership enabled JAL to consolidate and improve management and operational efficiency in the JAL Group's international passenger operations, part of the JAL Medium Term Corporate Plan 2000-2002. The airline introduced new uniforms for its <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> on April 1, 2005, and retired its last McDonnell Douglas DC-10 on October 31. JALways became an affiliate member of Oneworld on April 1, 2007, together with four of its sister airlines, in the alliance's biggest expansion in its young history.|$|E
5|$|The airline was {{established}} on October 5, 1990, as Japan Air Charter Co., Ltd. (JAZ), an 80 percent-owned low-cost charter subsidiary of Japan Airlines (JAL), to operate leisure flights to Asia-Pacific resort destinations from regional airports in Japan; {{in response to}} a Ministry of Transport policy. JAZ obtained its aircraft from JAL; its cockpit crews were American contract pilots based in Hawaii and its cabin crews were hired and based in Bangkok, where it operates a <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> training centre. JAZ obtained license to operate non-scheduled services on February 22, 1991 and operated its first charter flight from Fukuoka to Honolulu with a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 on July 1. The airline celebrated its 100,000th passenger on July 9, 1993, in a ceremony held in Sendai.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Braathens SAFE bought 15% of DNL. It also applied, {{though the}} sister company Braathens Helikopter, for {{concessions}} for helicopter services from Stavanger to offshore oil platforms. As a reaction, the incumbent, Helikopter Service, applied for Braathens SAFEs West Coast routes. At this point, SAS bought 15% of Helikopter Service. In 1984, Braathens SAFE introduced services to Farsund Airport, using wet leased F-27s from Busy Bee. The same arrangement {{was used to}} connect Haugesund to Bergen and Stavanger. In Haugesund, this was in competition with Norving. Busy Bee-operated planes were also used on routes from Sandefjord in competition with Norsk Flytjeneste. The same year, the <b>cabin</b> <b>crew</b> had a 14-day strike, halting all flights. It {{was caused by the}} company paying lower wages than SAS and Busy Bee. In 1985, a new booking system was introduced, that allowed overbooking. This gave increased revenue, but the company had to start compensating rejected passengers with a full refund and a free seat on the next flight. On 16 December 1985, the airline's administration moved into the a new building, the Diamond, located at Fornebu. The frequent flyer program Bracard was launched in September 1985. It was a cooperation with Inter Nor Hotels, and gave special privileges to travelers that made 25 full-price trips per year with Braathens.|$|E
