In 2006 Etisalat started a major restructuring program {{that resulted in the}} de-merger of many of its non-core business units [...] operating under the telecom's centralized and direct management; core services were consolidated and streamlined, reflecting the company's shift from a technology-driven telecom to a <b>customer-focused</b> services provider. As part of the program, Etisalat launched a re-branding campaign, releasing a new corporate logo and identity in May 2006. The restructuring culminated in the incorporation of Etisalat Services Holding LLC, which as of 2008 oversees the operation of Etisalat's non-telecom business units with huge success stories. On 27 March 2016 Saleh Al Abdooli has been appointed the Group CEO, extending his responsibility to international operations.|$|E

40|$|Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) has {{a growing}} {{potential}} in Saudi Arabia, due to {{widespread use of}} the internet and the maturity of the Information Technology (IT) infrastructure. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to assess the quality of E-Commerce websites in Saudi Arabia, using a proposed evaluation instrument. To achieve this aim, six E-Commerce websites were selected for evaluation and then categorized into three categories: domestic, regional and international. Each category consisted of two E-Commerce websites, with the international website category considered as a benchmark. The six websites were evaluated by sixty participants (n= 60) with good web design experience, following a set of guidelines offered by the evaluation instrument. The evaluation instrument described six key evaluation factors: appearance, content, organization, interaction, <b>customer-focus</b> and assurance. Each factor was evaluated by several indicators using a five-point scale ranging from not applicable (0) to very strong (4). To unify the views of all evaluators, a technique was introduced which would show the way in which each indicator was assessed based on several checklists (questions). The results therein revealed that international websites were of higher quality than regional and domestic websites with regard to all aspects of web evaluation. In addition, the quality of regional websites outweighed that of domestic websites with regard to appearance, content, organization, <b>customer-focus</b> and assurance, but not interaction...|$|R

40|$|More {{and more}} {{corporations}} {{throughout the world}} are adding value to their core corporate offerings through services. The trend is pervading almost all industries, is customer demand-driven, and perceived by corporations as sharpening their competitive edges. Modern corporations are increasingly offering fuller market packages or "bundles" of <b>customer-focussed</b> combinations of goods, services, support, self-service, and knowledge. But services are beginning to dominate. This movement is termed the "servitization of business" by authors Sandra Vandermerwe and Juan Rada, and is clearly a powerful new feature of total market strategy being adopted by the best companies. It is leading to new relationships between them and their customers. Giving many real-life examples, the authors assess the main motives driving corporations to servitization, and point out that its cumulative effects are changing the competitive dynamics in which managers will have to operate. The special challenge for top managers is how to blend services into the overall strategies of the company. ...|$|R

All three, loyalty, quality and satisfaction are significant factors that show how effective the customer service of an organization is. When customer service is effective then customer retention/ retention of product is considered. This study was carried out to investigate on the effectiveness of customer service in the retention of GSM SIM packs using a comparative analysis. Data were collected through the use of questionnaire administered to a determined sample size of users of the three major GSM service providers. Data were analyzed and the four hypotheses were tested using correlation and ANOVA. This study shows that with effective customer service, customer loyalty and customer satisfaction and customer retention can be achieved.

40|$|Customer {{satisfaction}} and service quality {{have so far}} been evaluated mostly from a local perspective although the quality element has been firmly established in academic library management {{for at least a}} decade. Critics of inter-institutional comparisons often object that different preconditions are not considered adequately. Examples from a joint user satisfaction survey conducted by 15 German university libraries in 2001 suggest that comparative data are a suitable means to identify cases of “best practice” and can effectively initialize processes of <b>customer-focussed</b> improvement. Furthermore, if compared with corresponding statistical data or performance measures, satisfaction ratings can reveal possible structural strengths and deficits relative to other libraries. On the other hand, follow-up telephone interviews with participating libraries showed that the survey results substantially challenged the institutions’ internal communication and public relations organisation, and underlined that even in a well-developed culture of assessment the need for professional mediation and coordination of comparative analyses may not be underestimated...|$|R

I develop a novel data set to measure aspects of {{corporate culture}} and use a regression discontinuity strategy to demonstrate stronger shareholder governance significantly changes aspects of culture. I find greater results-orientation but less <b>customer-focus,</b> integrity, and collaboration. Consistent with a positive link between governance and value, shareholders initially realize financial gains: increases in sales, profitability, and payout occur. However, over time, I find intangible assets associated with customer satisfaction and employee integrity deteriorate, which partly reverses the gains from greater results-orientation. These {{findings are consistent with}} a model of multitasking where stronger governance incentivizes managers to concentrate on easy-to-observe benchmarks {{at the expense of the}} harder-to-measure intangibles, even though such actions are not in the firm's best long-term interest.

Across these complementary research designs, I consistently find strong support for the economic importance of a corporate culture channel...|$|R
40|$|The latest {{paradigm}} shift in government, termed Transformational Government, puts the citizen in {{the centre of}} attention. Including citizens {{in the design of}} online one-stop portals can help governmental organisations to become more customer focussed. This study describes the initial efforts of an Australian state government to develop an information architecture to structure the content of their future one-stop portal. Hereby, card sorting exercises have been conducted and analysed, utilising contemporary approaches found in academic and non-scientific literature. This paper describes the findings of the card sorting exercises in this particular case and discusses the suitability of the applied approaches in general. These are distinguished into non-statistical, statistical, and hybrid approaches. Thus, on the one hand, this paper contributes to academia by describing the application of different card sorting approaches and discussing their strengths and weaknesses. On the other hand, this paper contributes to practice by explaining the approach that has been taken by the authors’ research partner in order to develop a <b>customer-focussed</b> governmental one-stop portal. Thus, they provide decision support for practitioners with regard to different analysis methods {{that can be used to}} complement recent approaches in Transformational Government...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{telecommunications}} industry, there are vast management methods invested {{in order to}} provide a competitive edge and loyalty amongst customers. Customer satisfaction remains the primary goal as a happy customer ensures sustainable profitability and overall business success. Customer experience encompasses the customers’ interaction with a company’s service and/or process. Due to the growing realisation that <b>customer-focus</b> should form a large part of a business strategy, the concept of customer experience emerged as a performance management tool and means to improve business processes. However, many companies still fail to measure and improve business processes based on customer experience. This project shows how Business Process Re-engineering and Customer Experience can couple to bring about impacting change to a cellular network provider by providing customers with what they want. Five processes are analysed so as {{to find out what it}} is that customers require within these processes. A Quality Function Deployment model is used to perform calculations that reveal the cell phone repairs process as the one to give the most profitable return after process re-design. A conceptual repairs process model will thus reconcile customer requirements and the given business processes. Thesis (B Eng.

40|$|Increasing the {{participation}} of New Zealanders and overseas visitors in recreation and tourism activities in public conservation areas is a priority task for the Department of Conservation (DOC). DOC has recognised that as an organisation charged with the management of over one-third of New Zealand’s land area, it needs to become more <b>customer-focussed</b> in its provision of recreation opportunities and visitor experiences. Maintaining and growing public participation in DOC-managed areas requires a broad understanding of the nature, interests, preferences and motivations of visitors, and an in-depth understanding of their recreation patterns, trends and constraints. To help anticipate future requirements, DOC commissioned a programme of research to review existing literature on tourism and recreation research, focussing on visitor demand for, participation at, and segmentation at public conservation areas, both in New Zealand and Australia. The programme has a specific focus on literature pertaining to outdoor recreation, nature-based tourism, ecotourism and heritage tourism.

40|$|Reduction of {{frictional}} losses and NVH (Noise, Vibration, and Harshness) refinement constitute the key <b>customer-focussed</b> aims in {{internal combustion engine}} development. Numerical predictive tools have progressively become {{an important part of}} achieving these aims. However, the interactions and sometimes the conflicting requirements of the aforementioned objectives call for the inclusion of many phenomena in realistic models of practical significance. These phenomena occur at varying physics of scale, from micro-scale tribological conjunctions to small scale vibrations and onto large scale inertial dynamics. At the same time, the inclusion of many disciplines for a cohesive analysis will be required, such as rigid body dynamics and elastodynamics, as well as tribology. While the inclusion of such a multi-disciplinary approach is deemed essential, the use of analytical rather than numerical models, as far as possible, would render realistic predictions within the usual tight industrial timescales. This article presents an experimentally validated model of the engine piston assembly, which is based on the multi-physics, multi-scale nature of the interacting components. Furthermore, it provides predictions of some current development trends in engines such as the high output power to weight ratio and offset crankshaft. The emphasis of this article is on the integration of the kinetic reactions arising from the tribological conjunction of the dynamics of engine subsystems, piston, and crankshaft...|$|R
