25|$|The {{experience}} in northern Ireland gave Barkas {{the idea that}} every theatre of war is naturally patterned. When an army unit goes {{against the grain of}} the pattern, he reasoned, it becomes conspicuous; to hide, it has to go with the pattern. He developed a simple illustration of this point, by dropping a <b>collar</b> <b>stud</b> on a carpet. When it fell on a plain area, it was easy to see; when in a patterned area, it had to be searched for.|$|E

60|$|After {{the first}} start, the rapidity of his {{collapse}} was appalling. The seclusion of the first-class carriage {{to which his}} ticket entitled him, and which his somewhat peculiar toilet certainly rendered advisable, was suddenly immensely distasteful. He bought Tit-bits and Ally Sloper at the bookstall, squeezed his way into a crowded third-class compartment, and joined in a noisy game of nap with half a dozen roistering young clerks, who were full of jokes about his crumpled dinner clothes. Arrived in London, he had the utmost difficulty to refrain from buying a red and yellow tie displayed in the station lavatory where he washed and shaved, and the necessity for purchasing a <b>collar</b> <b>stud</b> left {{him for a few}} moments in imminent peril of acquiring a large brass-stemmed production with a sham diamond head. He hastened to his rooms, scarcely daring to look about him, turned over the clothes in his wardrobe with a curious dissatisfaction, and dressed himself hastily in as offensive a combination of garments as he could lay his hands upon. He bought some common Virginian cigarettes and {{made his way to the}} offices of Messrs. Waddington and Forbes.|$|E
50|$|Tuberculous {{lymphadenitis}} is {{popularly known}} as <b>collar</b> <b>stud</b> abscess, due to its proximity to the collar bone and superficial resemblance to a <b>collar</b> <b>stud,</b> although {{this is just one}} of the five stages of the disease. The characteristic morphological element is the tuberculous granuloma (caseating tubercule): giant multinucleated cells (Langhans cells), surrounded by epithelioid cells aggregates, T cell lymphocytes and few fibroblasts. Granulomatous tubercules evolve to central caseous necrosis and tend to become confluent, replacing the lymphoid tissue.|$|E

60|$|The {{revolt of}} Matter against Man (which I believe to exist) {{has now been}} reduced to a {{singular}} condition. It is the small things rather than the large things which make war against us and, I may add, beat us. The bones of the last mammoth have long ago decayed, a mighty wreck; the tempests no longer devour our navies, nor the mountains with hearts of fire heap hell over our cities. But we are engaged in a bitter and eternal war with small things; chiefly with microbes and with <b>collar</b> <b>studs.</b> The stud with which I was engaged (on fierce and equal terms) as I made the above reflections, was one which I was trying to introduce into my shirt collar when a loud knock came at the door.|$|R

50|$|Similarly to Cieszynian folk costume, {{jewellery}} is {{a replica}} of ornaments from times of the Renaissance and the Reformation. Because of its being a trade rout and having fertile soil, Cieszyn was rather a rich city. Fashion was being modified in accordance to European markets thanks to trips of the last descendants of the Piast dynasty in Cieszyn on {{the turn of the}} 16th and 17th century. Cieszyn was the biggest centre of jewellery trade in the region. Ornaments were made of silver, gold, and some alloys. Metalwork techniques were filigree and casting. Male costumes were decorated only with metal buttons (knefle). A set of jewellery of a wealthy woman consisted of a <b>collar</b> <b>stud,</b> orpant, hoczki and belt.|$|E

50|$|<b>Stud</b> <b>collars,</b> {{also called}} wolf collars, {{protection}} collars, or spiked collars {{depending on the}} attachments, are collars fitted with metal studs, dulled points, or sharp points that traditionally prevented another animal from biting the dog's neck. Commonly, spikes are hand-set and tightly riveted for extra security. This type of collar dates back to ancient Greece, when dogs protecting livestock were given nail-studded collars {{to protect them from}} wolves or other predators. In modern societies, <b>stud</b> <b>collars</b> are more commonly considered a fashion accessory.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: My garment {{is geared}} towards the full-figured woman. Whether petite or plus size I {{wanted to create}} a garment for women with true curves. Through {{personal}} experience, I have found that many trendy clothes never fit my curves quite right. It’s frustrating seeing a trend that speaks to you, going in and trying it on, and having it not fit your body. There is a real lack of fashionable clothing for full-figured women, and I {{wanted to create a}} garment that helped fill that void. Process: During the development stage I started with my fabric selection, specifically I have been drawn to the color cobalt blue and decided to feature it in this design. I saw the fabric and it reminded me of the galaxy with the gold sparkle representing the stars with the aurora borealis mixed in. I wanted to make a garment that was a little edgy as well as ethereal to capture the essence of outer space. Via research I incorporated the current trends of the Peter Pan <b>collar,</b> <b>stud</b> trim, and flare skirt. Techniques: The dress was created through draping, which is manipulating fabric on a dress form to create patterns. The draping was then trued to create the final paper patterns. A sample was created, fitted on my model and changes were made to the pattern. When constructing the final fully lined garment I used a straight stitch on all the seams and added boning in the bodice for structure, as well as a denim inner lining for further bust support. Materials: 100 percent cotton exterior, 100 percent polyester lining, bronze stud trim, invisible zipper, thread...|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the early}} 20th century, most shirt collars were {{turned up in}} some manner. Men and women alike wore tall, stiff collars (as much as three inches tall), not unlike a taller version of a {{clerical}} collar, made either of starched linen, cotton, or lace. The writer H. G. Wells remarked in his 1902 book Kipps that these [...] "made the neck quite sore and left a red mark under the ears." [...] Between the late 19th and mid-20th centuries, men's collars were often detachable from their shirts, connected only by two removable <b>collar</b> <b>studs</b> (one in front and one in back). Detachable collars were very stiff, and either stood straight up (as in a Hamilton collar) or were pressed over at an ironed-in, starched crease (as in a Fremont collar). After World War II, mass-production gradually phased out detachable collars from ordinary dress shirts. Occasionally, one can still find detachable collar formal shirts, designed to be worn with a tuxedo or evening dress.|$|R

2500|$|The shirt {{required}} for white tie is very specific. It {{should have a}} detachable wing collar and be fastened with shirt studs instead of buttons on the front. The studs are normally mother of pearl set in gold or silver, but black onyx inlay is also permissible. The cufflinks should match the studs. The shirt front has panels made of different material {{from the rest of}} the shirt which are the only parts seen under the waistcoat. The shape of the panels, one on each side, is either rectangular, or the older U-shape (designed to sit under the older 1920s U-shaped waistcoats, now largely replaced by the more modern V-shape). The material for the panels is either layers of thick plain cotton that is heavily starched (this type is often called a boiled front shirt as the shirt needs to be put in boiling water to remove the starch before cleaning), or marcella (piqué) cotton. [...] Marcella is more common, but a little less formal, though still appropriate, since it was originally designed to be used on formal evening shirts, as the ribbing can pick up more starch and create an even stiffer front. Traditionally, collarless shirts with a detachable wing collar fastened on with <b>collar</b> <b>studs</b> have been used, but all-in-one designs are occasionally seen, though this is considered incorrect and to give a poor appearance by many. Cuffs are single, and heavily starched (if the front is marcella, the cuffs usually match).|$|R

40|$|Companion dogs face unique welfare challenges, {{mostly because}} they live {{embedded}} within the human community, {{in a private}} sector not readily amenable to the enforcement of welfare standards. In Australia, anyone can purchase a pet dog. There is no requirement for dog owners to demonstrate a minimum level of competence in identifying {{the needs of the}} animal, or that they have the training and resources necessary to provide appropriate housing, nutrition, health care and quality of life. This does not necessarily lead to poor welfare. Many dog owners are well informed about the needs of their canine companions and highly committed to ensuring that these needs are met. The provision of dog goods, ranging from comfortable beds and colourful toys through to diamond <b>studded</b> <b>collars</b> and expensive food treats, is identified as a growth area by economists 1.

5000|$|Later, Wolverine invited {{his team}} to Japan for his wedding to Mariko, which Yukio joined subsequently. Viper and the Silver Samurai {{poisoned}} the X-Men during a dinner that Logan hosted for them. Logan, tasting the poison, warned Ororo and knocked the cup from her hand before she could drink it. While the others were recuperating from the attack, Storm, Wolverine, Rogue (who had been largely unaffected), and Yukio went after Viper and the Silver Samurai to stop his plot to assassinate Mariko, who was his half-sister. Yukio posed as a decoy, disguising herself as Mariko to lead them away from her. During their altercation with Viper and Silver Samurai, Storm found her powers inexplicably going out of control, endangering her life. Yukio knocked Storm into the nearby bay, enabling them {{to escape from the}} Silver Samurai. (These events had actually been brought about and influenced by the mutant villain Mastermind, who was conducting a revenge campaign against the X-Men at the time. He was also responsible for the subsequent halting of Wolverine's and Mariko's wedding).
