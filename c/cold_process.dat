25|$|A cold-process soapmaker first {{looks up}} the {{saponification}} value for each unique fat on an oil specification sheet. Oil specification sheets contain laboratory test results for each fat, including the precise saponification {{value of the}} fat. The saponification value for a specific fat varies by season and by specimen species. This value {{is used to calculate}} the exact amount of sodium hydroxide to react with the fat to form soap. The saponification value must be converted into an equivalent sodium hydroxide value for use in <b>cold</b> <b>process</b> soapmaking. Excess unreacted lye in the soap results in a very high pH and can burn or irritate skin, whereas not enough lye leaves the soap greasy. Most soap makers formulate their recipes with a 2â€“5% deficit of lye, to account for the unknown deviation of saponification value between their oil batch and laboratory averages.|$|E

2500|$|The {{industrial}} production of soap involves continuous processes, such as continuous addition {{of fat and}} removal of product. Smaller-scale production involves the traditional batch processes. The three variations are the <b>cold</b> <b>process,</b> wherein the reaction takes place substantially at room temperature; the semi-boiled or [...] "hot process," [...] wherein the reaction takes place near the boiling point; and the fully boiled process, wherein the reactants are boiled at least once and the glycerol is recovered. There are several types of semi-boiled hot process methods, the most common being DBHP (Double Boiler Hot Process) and CPHP (Crock Pot Hot Process). Most soapmakers, however, continue to prefer the <b>cold</b> <b>process</b> method. The <b>cold</b> <b>process</b> and hot process (semi-boiled) are the simplest, and are typically used by small artisans and hobbyists producing handmade decorative soaps. The glycerol remains in the soap and the reaction continues for many days after the soap is poured into molds. The glycerol is left during the hot-process method, but at the high temperature employed, the reaction is practically completed in the kettle, before the soap is poured into molds. This simple and quick process is employed in small factories all over the world.|$|E

Research limitations/implications: There were four different designs in billet. One was a cylinder without decompression cavity, and the others were the cylinders with truncate-cone, point-cone and semispherical decompression cavity respectively, with different shapes but almost the same volumes. Practical implications: Through the simulation analysis, the influence of decompression cavity with the same volumes but different shapes on the load needed in process, the change of workpiece features, and the strengthened effects on workpieces in both open type and closed type <b>cold</b> hobbing <b>processes,</b> would be explored.

2500|$|Handmade soap {{from the}} <b>cold</b> <b>process</b> also differs from industrially made soap in that {{an excess of}} fat is used, beyond that needed to consume the alkali (in a cold-pour process, this excess fat is called [...] "superfatting"), and the {{glycerol}} left in acts as a moisturizing agent. However, the glycerine also makes the soap softer and less resistant to becoming [...] "mushy" [...] if left wet. Since {{it is better to}} add too much oil and have left-over fat, than to add too much lye and have left-over lye, soap produced from the hot process also contains left-over glycerol and its concomitant pros and cons. Further addition of glycerol and processing of this soap produces glycerin soap. Superfatted soap is more skin-friendly than one without extra fat. However, if too much fat is added, it can leave a [...] "greasy" [...] feel to the skin. Sometimes, an emollient additive, such as jojoba oil or shea butter, is added [...] "at trace" [...] (i.e., {{the point at which the}} saponification process is sufficiently advanced that the soap has begun to thicken in the <b>cold</b> <b>process</b> method) in the belief that nearly all the lye will be spent and it will escape saponification and remain intact. In the case of hot-process soap, an emollient may be added after the initial oils have saponified so they remain unreacted in the finished soap. Superfatting can also be accomplished through a process known as [...] "lye discount" [...] in which the soap maker uses less alkali than required instead of adding extra fats.|$|E

Developing a more complete understanding of fluxes, storage, and transformations of water and energy in cold land areas is a critical focus of the NASA Earth Science Enterprise Research Strategy, the NASA Global Water and Energy Cycle (GWEC) Initiative, the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX), and the GEWEX Americas Prediction Project (GAPP). The movement of water and energy through cold regions in turn plays a large role in ecological activity and biogeochemical cycles. Quantitative understanding of <b>cold</b> land <b>processes</b> over large areas will require synergistic advancements in 1) understanding how <b>cold</b> land <b>processes,</b> most comprehensively understood at local or hillslope scales, extend to larger scales, 2) improved representation of <b>cold</b> land <b>processes</b> in coupled and uncoupled land-surface models, and 3) a breakthrough in large-scale observation of hydrologic properties, including snow characteristics, soil moisture, the extent of frozen soils, and the transition between frozen and thawed soil conditions.
