40|$|Managed <b>care</b> and performance-based <b>contracting</b> {{in state}} child welfare systems have {{appeared}} {{as a consequence of}} the increased attention that federal and state policymakers are paying to system performance and service costs. This study reports findings from a longitudinal natural experiment that examined the effects of a performance-based, managed <b>care</b> <b>contracting</b> mechanism on foster care outcomes. Multivariate analyses identified market-based disparities in some of the outcomes experienced by foster children: controlling for child, family, and caseworker characteristics, children served by agencies with performance-based, managed <b>care</b> <b>contracts</b> were less likely to be reunified and more likely to enter kinship foster homes, when compared to children served by agencies reimbursed through fee-for-service contracts. Analyses also suggested that there were few other variables consistently associated with foster care outcomes. These results call into question the evidentiary basis for the diffusion of managed <b>care</b> and performance-based <b>contracting</b> in the child welfare sector, and suggest that state child welfare systems ensure that foster care placement decisions are influenced more by child and family needs than by financial considerations. In addition, they suggest that managed <b>care</b> and performance-based <b>contracts</b> should include specific financial incentives for family reunification. ...|$|R

40|$|Life care {{communities}} offer {{long term}} {{care to the}} elderly {{in the context of}} a residential community. Residents move into a life care community while still relatively young (though typically past age 65), initially occupying an independent living unit situated in a living complex similar to a retirement community. Later, when a resident requires more intensive care, she moves to an on-site nursing facility. In this paper we present an economic analysis of the life care industry. Our model includes a detailed specification of elderly couples' utility, a description of elderly morbidity and mortality experiences, and a formulation of the life <b>care</b> <b>contract.</b> Our results suggest that life care can offer considerable benefits to the elderly; in particular, we calculate that - based on the contractual terms which will be offered by a profit-maximizing life care operator - moving into a life care facility provides an elderly couple of age 65 with an expected surplus of $ 20, 000 to $ 80, 000 as compared with the alternative of remaining in their own home and utilizing (when necessary) a stand-alone nursing home. We also show that introducing into the model the risk of operator bankruptcy, which historically has been significant, substantially alters the equilibrium life <b>care</b> <b>contract,</b> and generates contractual terms which are quite close to those observed in practice.

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of 3, 000 urban hospitals, this article {{examines}} the contributions of selected hospital characteristics to variations in hospital technical efficiencies, while it accounts for multiple products and inputs, and controls for local environmental variations. Four hospital characteristics are examined: hospital size, membership in a multihospital system, ownership, and payer mix (managed <b>care</b> <b>contracts,</b> percent Medicare, and percent Medicaid). Ownership and percent Medicare are consistently found to be related significantly to hospital efficiency. Within the ownership variable, government hospitals tend to be more efficient and for-profit hospitals less efficient than other hospitals. Higher percentages of Medicare payment are negatively related to efficiency. While not consistently significant across all five of the MSA size categories in which the analyses are conducted, possession of managed <b>care</b> <b>contracts,</b> membership in a multihospital system, and size all are consistently related positively to hospital technical efficiency. These variables are also all significant when the hospitals are examined in a combined analysis. Percent Medicaid was not significant in any of the analyses.

40|$|Background: Competition on the {{insurance}} market assumes that insurance organizations differ {{in what they}} offer, that the consumers of insurance products perceive differences, and that information about differences is available in a transparent way. With the introduction of {{the insurance}} reform in The Netherlands efforts have been made to measure consumer evaluations of health insurance plans and to provide this information to consumers. Methods: In the summer of 2005, questionnaires were sent to ± 31 000 insured (net response rate 45 %). The questionnaire was based on a combination of the CAHPS (developed in the United States) and the QUOTE (developed in The Netherlands). Multilevel analysis was used to correct for case-mix differences between insurance organizations. Results: People’s experiences with health <b>care</b> (<b>contracted</b> by their health insurance organization) did not correlate between respondents with the same insurance organization. However, their experience with service levels of their insurance organization did cluster (ICC up to 9 % for ease of access by telephone). In our presentation, we will relate this to the aims of the health insurance reform and to the importance that consumers attach to different aspects of their insurer’s performance. Conclusions: Currently consumers mainly perceive differences in service levels and premiums and not in the quality of <b>care</b> <b>contracted.</b> Consumers expect that in the future the insurance law will affect premiums and service but less so the purchasing activities of insurers and the quality of <b>care</b> they <b>contract.</b> (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies have}} found that even limited prevention-related {{interventions}} can affect health behaviors such as substance use and risky sex. Substance abuse treatment providers are ideal candidates to provide these services, but typically have little or no financial incentive to do so. The {{purpose of this study was}} therefore to explore why some substance abuse treatment units have added new prevention and outreach services. Based on an ecological framework of organizational strategy, three categories of predictors were tested: (1) environmental, (2) unit-level, and (3) unit leadership. Results A lagged cross-sectional logistic model of 450 outpatient substance abuse treatment units revealed that local per capita income, mental health center affiliation, and clinical supervisors' graduate degrees were positively associated with likelihood of adding prevention-related education and outreach services. Managed <b>care</b> <b>contracts</b> and methadone treatment were negatively associated with addition of these services. No hospital-affiliated agencies added prevention and outreach services during the study period. Conclusion Findings supported the study's ecological perspective on organizational strategy, with factors at environmental, unit, and unit leadership levels associated with additions of prevention and outreach services. Among the significant predictors, ties to managed care payers and unit leadership graduate education emerge as potential leverage points for public policy. In the current sample, units with managed <b>care</b> <b>contracts</b> were less likely to add prevention and outreach services. This is not surprising, given managed care's emphasis on cost control. However, the association with this payment source suggests that public managed care programs might affects prevention and outreach differently through revised incentives. Specifically, government payers could explicitly compensate substance abuse treatment units in managed <b>care</b> <b>contracts</b> for prevention and outreach. The effects of supervisor graduate education on likelihood of adding new prevention and outreach programs suggests that leaders' education can affect organizational strategy. Foundation and government officials may encourage prevention and outreach by funding curricular enhancements to graduate degree programs demonstrating the importance of public goods. Overall, these findings suggest that both money and professional education affect substance abuse treatment unit additions of prevention and outreach services, as well as other factors less amenable to policy intervention. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop and}} test a model, based on {{resource}} dependence theory, that identifies the organizational and environmental characteristics associated with nursing home participation in managed care. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING: Data for statistical analysis {{derived from a}} survey of Directors of Nursing {{in a sample of}} nursing homes in eight states (n = 308). These data were merged with data from the On-line Survey Certification and Reporting System, the Medicare Managed Care State/County Data File, and the 1995 Area Resource File. STUDY DESIGN: Since the dependent variable is dichotomous, the logistic procedure was used to fit the regression. The analysis was weighted using SUDAAN. FINDINGS: Participation in a provider network, higher proportions of resident care covered by Medicare, providing IV therapy, greater availability of RNs and physical therapists, and Medicare HMO market penetration are associated with a greater likelihood of having a managed <b>care</b> <b>contract.</b> CONCLUSION: As more Medicare recipients enroll in HMOs, nursing home involvement in managed care is likely to increase. Interorganizational linkages enhance the likelihood of managed care participation.

40|$|A {{community}} {{nurse is}} required to have excellent interpersonal, teaching, collaborative and clinical skills {{in order to develop}} effective individualised client care contracts. Using a descriptive qualitative design data was collected from two focus groups of fourteen community nurses to explore the issues surrounding negotiating and contracting client care contracts from the perspective of community nurses. Thematic analysis revealed three themes: ‘assessment of needs’, ‘education towards enablement’, and ‘negotiation’. ‘Assessment of needs’ identified that community nurses assess both the client’s requirements for health care as well as the ability of the nurse to provide that care. ‘Education towards enablement’ described that education of the client is a common strategy used by community nurses to establish realistic goals of health care as part of developing an ongoing care plan. The final theme, ‘negotiation’, involved an informed agreement between the client and the community nurse which forms the origin of the <b>care</b> <b>contract</b> that will direct the partnership between the client and the nurse. Of importance for community nurses is that development of successful person-centred care contracts requires skillful negotiation of care that strikes the balance between the needs of the client and the ability of the nurse to meet those needs...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Exploration of the {{societal}} health economic effects occurring {{during the first}} year after implementation of Computerised Patient Records (CPRs) at Primary Health Care (PHC) centres. DESIGN: Comparative case studies of practice processes and their consequences one year after CPR implementation, using the constant comparison method. Application of transaction-cost analyses at a societal level on the results. SETTING: Two urban PHC centres under a managed <b>care</b> <b>contract</b> in OstergÃ¶tland county, Sweden. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Central implementation issues. First-year societal direct normal costs, direct unexpected costs, and indirect costs. Societal benefits. RESULTS: The total societal effect of the CPR implementation was a cost of nearly 250, 000 SEK (USD 37, 000) per GP team. About 20 % of the effect consisted of direct unexpected costs, accured from the reduction of practitioners' leisure time. The main issues in the implementation process were medical informatics knowledge and computer skills, adaptation of the human-computer interaction design to practice routines, and information access through the CPR. CONCLUSIONS: The societal costs exceed the benefits {{during the first year}} after CPR implementation at the observed PHC centres. Early investments in requirements engineering and staff training may increase the efficiency. Exploitation of the CPR for disease prevention and clinical quality improvement is necessary to defend the investment in societal terms.
