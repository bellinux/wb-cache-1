40|$|With {{access to}} {{inexpensive}} credit, states can finance wars without overburdening their constituents, and face relatively small short-term costs compared to states with poor credit access. As {{a result of}} these economic benefits, states with lower <b>credit</b> <b>costs</b> {{will be more likely to}} win their wars, ceteris paribus. However, lower borrowing costs provide states domestic political benefits, which I argue are more important for democracies than nondemocracies. Since expensive credit forces states to rely on its citizens for revenue, governments that are more sensitive to their citizens ’ preferences are at a disadvantage. In sum, I argue that democracies are more sensitive to <b>credit</b> <b>costs</b> than authoritarian regimes. To test this theory, this article analyzes a data set of wars using logistic regressions and matching techniques, and examines the case of the Chaco War. The results demonstrate that the costs of borrowing have a substantial effect on war outcomes, and that these costs are more important for democracies than nondemocracies...|$|E

Private agents do not internalize the effect of their borrowing on economy-wide <b>credit</b> <b>costs</b> and thus would like to borrow more than the socially efficient level.

40|$|Abstract: Financial {{capability}} requires understanding {{measures of}} consumer <b>credit</b> <b>cost</b> {{and using them}} appropriately in credit judgements and decisions. In three studies, UK adults’ understanding and use of <b>credit</b> <b>cost</b> and duration information were investigated from a bounded rationality perspective. Study 1, part of a representative survey of UK adults (N = 1000), found that when presented with annual percentage rate (APR) participants significantly overestimated the total cost (TC) of a 12 -month loan. In Study 2, loan duration and APR were varied in an independent groups experiment (N = 242). Bank customers’ TC estimates were sensitive to both loan duration and APR but TC was again substantially overestimated. Study 3 was an independent groups experiment investigating the effect of APR and TC information on credit decisions (N = 241). APR often influenced decisions between loans varying in duration and monthly repayment, but this effect was moderated by TC information. It was concluded that: (1) people generally misunderstand the relation between APR and TC; and (2) although APR information can have a large effect on credit decisions, its effect is either attenuated or amplified by TC information. The findings are interpreted {{in terms of a}} ‘take the best APR’ heuristic and a dual mental account model of instalment credit.

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} {{on the nature of}} the monetary policy trans-mission mechanism by combining traditional monetary vector autore-gression (VAR) analysis with high frequency identification (HFI) of monetary policy shocks. We show that the shocks identified using HFI surprises as external instruments produce responses in output and inflation consistent with those obtained in the standard monetary VAR analysis. We also find, however, that monetary policy responses typically produce “modest ” movements in short rates that lead to “large ” movements in <b>credit</b> <b>costs</b> and economic activity. The large movements in <b>credit</b> <b>costs</b> are mainly due to the reaction of both term premia and credit spreads that are typically absent from the base-line model of monetary transmission.

40|$|The {{first two}} {{chapters}} of my dissertation study {{the impact of}} private external debt on the economy, both theoretically and empirically. The third chapter is focused on an econometric method that is of central interest in empirical macroeconomics-impulse response functions. The first chapter analyzes {{the effects of a}} shift from sovereign to private sector borrowing on <b>credit</b> <b>costs,</b> default frequencies, aggregate debt levels and country welfare, using a theoretical model with decentralized borrowing and centralized default. Relative to a model with centralized borrowing, decentralized borrowing drives up aggregate <b>credit</b> <b>costs</b> and sovereign default risk, and reduces aggregate welfare. Private agents do not internalize the effect of their borrowing on economy-wide <b>credit</b> <b>costs</b> and tend to overborrow. Depending on the severity of default penalties, decentralized borrowing may lead to either {{too much or too little}} debt in equilibrium. The second chapter empirically studies the effects of firms' foreign debt and other characteristics on firm performance in financial crisis. Using Korean firm-level data on publicly-listed and privately-held firms together with firm exit data, we find strong evidence of the balance-sheet effect for small firms at both the intensive and extensive margins. During the financial crisis, small firms with more short-term foreign debt are more likely to go bankrupt, and experience larger declines in sales conditional on survival. The extensive margin accounts for a large fraction of small firms' adjustment during the crisis. The third chapter studies whether the choice of different methods of constructing impulse response functions leads to different conclusions about the responses of monetary policy. The impulse response confidence intervals based on local projections (LPs) tend to be less accurate and wider than those based on standard vector autoregressive (VAR) models. The accuracy of joint intervals can be more erratic in practice than typical pointwise confidence intervals. For a standard model of monetary policy, the use of LP estimates or joint intervals does not overturn the substantive findings of VAR studies based on pointwise intervals...|$|E

A major {{study conducted by}} the Young Foundation and funded by the Economic and Social Research Council investigating the use of high <b>cost</b> <b>credit</b> in Wales. The research was carried out throughout 2015 with the final report - Credit where credit’s due? Understanding experiences of high <b>cost</b> <b>credit</b> in Wales – published in May 2016. An estimated 12 million people across the UK lack access to affordable credit, something the majority take for granted in everyday life. The alternatives for many are high cost lenders – payday loans, doorstep lenders, or expensive rent-to-own stores on the high street. This financial exclusion is harmful to individuals and families, our communities and the wider economy. Objectives: We set out to understand the scale of the issue, pathways into and journeys through high <b>cost</b> <b>credit,</b> and the impact this has. We aimed to identify opportunities and offer suggestions for new and improved products, services and ways of engaging consumers – and to outline what might work as alternatives to high <b>cost</b> <b>credit.</b> Key Findings: •	Six per cent of the Welsh population have used one or more of rent-to-own stores, home credit and payday loans in the last year. •	Customers come {{from all walks of life}} but are most likely to be young families. •	Reasons for using high <b>cost</b> <b>credit</b> range from paying for Christmas or buying new items for the home, to simply paying the bills and making ends meet. For most, these represent essential purchases. •	The majority of people turn straight to high <b>cost</b> <b>credit</b> without considering different types of credit or comparing offers between lenders. •	High <b>cost</b> <b>credit</b> customers are typically extremely aware of their income and outgoings, often using ‘jam jar’ and other informal money management solutions. •	Many see high <b>cost</b> <b>credit</b> options as being ‘for people like me’ and one of a very limited set of financial options. •	The majority of high <b>cost</b> <b>credit</b> customers live in communities where these types of borrowing are normal. •	Home credit providers especially are in a strong position to encourage repeat borrowing. •	Customer perceptions of payday loans still firmly reflect the pre-cap market. •	By contrast, rent-to-own and home credit have largely slipped through the net of negative publicity. •	Regulating all forms of high <b>cost</b> <b>credit</b> out of existence is not the answer. •	There is a clear need for market growth in the affordable credit market...|$|R

Currently, the accounts in arrears between enterprises have become a very serious problem, due to the imperfect internal management mechanism and lack of effective credit sale risk management system.
