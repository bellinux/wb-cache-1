50|$|A {{darknet market}} or <b>cryptomarket</b> is a {{commercial}} website {{on the web}} that operates via darknets such as Tor or I2P. They function primarily as black markets, selling or brokering transactions involving drugs, cyber-arms, weapons, counterfeit currency, stolen credit card details, forged documents, unlicensed pharmaceuticals, steroids, and other illicit goods {{as well as the}} sale of legal products. In December 2014, a study by Gareth Owen from the University of Portsmouth suggested the second most popular sites on Tor were darknet markets.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundIn {{spite of}} globalizing {{processes}} ‘offline’ retail drug markets remain localized and – {{in recent decades}} – typically ‘closed’, in which dealers sell primarily to known customers. We characterize drug cryptomarkets as ‘anonymous open’ marketplaces that allow the diffusion of drugs across locales. Where <b>cryptomarket</b> customers make stock-sourcing purchases for offline distribution, the <b>cryptomarket</b> may indirectly serve drug users who are not themselves <b>cryptomarket</b> customers, thereby increasing the drug diffusing capacity of these marketplaces. Our research aimed to identify wholesale activity on the first major <b>cryptomarket,</b> Silk Road 1. MethodsData were collected 13 – 15 September 2013. A bespoke web crawler downloaded content from the first major drug <b>cryptomarket,</b> Silk Road 1. This generated data on 1031 vendors and 10, 927 drug listings. We estimated monthly revenues to ascertain {{the relative importance of}} wholesale priced listings. ResultsWholesale-level revenue generation (sales for listings priced over USD $ 1000. 00) accounted for {{about a quarter of the}} revenue generation on SR 1 overall. Ecstasy-type drugs dominated wholesale activity on this marketplace, but we also identified substantial wholesale transactions for benzodiazepines and prescription stimulants. Less important, but still generating wholesale revenue, were cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin. Although vendors on the marketplace were located in 41 countries, wholesale activity was confined to only a quarter of these, with China, the Netherlands, Canada and Belgium prominent. ConclusionsThe <b>cryptomarket</b> may function in part as a virtual broker, linking wholesalers with offline retail-level distributors. For drugs like ecstasy, these marketplaces may link vendors in producer countries directly with retail level suppliers. Wholesale activity on cryptomarkets may serve to increase the diffusion of new drugs – and wider range of drugs – in offline drug markets, thereby indirectly serving drug users who are not <b>cryptomarket</b> customers themselves. Cryptomarkets provide researchers and policy makers with a rich source of drug monitoring information. Further research should ascertain whether their virtual location may reduce the violence associated with middle market drug activity. We caution that conflict may instead manifest in other ways, including threats, fraud, and blackmail...|$|E

Unintended side effects of targeting <b>cryptomarkets</b> [...] Chapter 8. Conclusions and future directions. The development of <b>cryptomarkets</b> is a new criminological phenomenon. <b>Cryptomarkets</b> are defined as a platform that operates on an encrypted part of the Internet and enables its users to anonymously communicate and conduct illicit transactions. This research analyses <b>cryptomarkets</b> through current Australian drug policy. The findings of this research reveal that different organisations such as law enforcement agencies and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare have different perspectives and priorities when exploring the operations of <b>cryptomarkets.</b> These agencies often have contradictory views when analysing drug-related issues through current Australian drug policy, as they have different agendas on how those issues should be addressed. From the perspective of law enforcement agencies, {{it is necessary to}} disrupt the infrastructure of <b>cryptomarkets</b> and prevent people from conducting illicit transactions. However, {{from the perspective of the}} Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, disrupting <b>cryptomarkets</b> would have negative consequences for the Australian Government and Australian communities. In conclusion, this research argues that although <b>cryptomarkets</b> are a transformative platform that enables individuals to conduct illicit transactions, they should not be disrupted because they offer a less violent alternative to conventional drug distribution networks.

40|$|<b>Cryptomarkets</b> – online, {{anonymous}} marketplaces for illicit {{goods and}} services that mostly specialise in drugs – account for a small but rapidly growing share of the illicit drug market in many countries. Policy responses so far are generally {{based on the assumption}} that their rise will only increase drug harms. In this contribution for debate, we question this assumption. We use existing theory on the effects of drug markets on various forms of harm, alongside emerging evidence on the operation of <b>cryptomarkets,</b> to assess anticipated harms and benefits. We suggest it is likely that <b>cryptomarkets</b> will increase both the amount and the range of substances that are sold. But we argue that the effects on harms will depend on whether <b>cryptomarkets</b> also increase the quality and safety of products that are sold, provide information to consumers that they can use to reduce the level of harm for each unit of consumption, and reduce transactional conflict involved in drug purchasing...|$|R

40|$|Background: The recent {{proliferation}} of cryptomarkets {{and the associated}} emergence of a sub-field {{of research on the}} anonymous web have outpaced the development of an ethical consensus regarding research methods and dissemination amongst scholars working in this unique online space. The peculiar characteristics of <b>cryptomarket</b> research, which often involves encryption, illegal activity, large-scale data collection, and geographical separation from research participants, challenge conventional ethical frameworks. A further complicating factor for reaching ethical consensus is the confluence of scholars drawn from a variety of academic disciplines, each with their own particular norms, practices and perspectives. This paper is intended to stimulate awareness and debate, and to prompt further reflection amongst scholars studying these fascinating online phenomena. The paper explores tensions and addresses some of the more prominent and pressing ethical questions, including public vs. private online spaces, anonymity, data sharing and ownership, risks and threats to research subjects and researchers. Also discussed is how best to balance the potential harms of <b>cryptomarket</b> research against benefits to the public. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Background Cryptomarkets are digital {{platforms}} {{that use}} anonymising software (e. g. Tor) and cryptocurrencies (e. g. Bitcoin) to facilitate trade {{of goods and}} services, most notably illicit drugs. Cryptomarkets may reduce systemic violence compared with in-person drug trading because no face-to-face contact is required and disputes can be resolved through a neutral third party. In this paper, we describe the purchasing behaviour of <b>cryptomarket</b> users and then compare the self-reported experiences of threats, violence and other drug-market concerns when obtaining drugs from cryptomarkets with obtaining drugs through friends, known dealers and strangers. Methods The Global Drug Survey was completed in late 2014 by a self-selected sample who reported accessing drugs through cryptomarkets in the last 12 months (N =  3794). Results Their median age was 22 years and 82 % were male. The drug types most commonly obtained through cryptomarkets were MDMA/Ecstasy (55 %), cannabis (43 %) and LSD (35 %). <b>Cryptomarket</b> users reported using a median of 2 sources in addition to cryptomarkets to access drugs, the most common being in-person friendships (74 %), in-person dealers (57 %) and open markets/strangers (26 %). When asked to nominate the main source they would use if cryptomarkets were unavailable, 49 % nominated friends, 34 % known dealers and 4 % strangers. ‘Threats to personal safety’ (3 %) and ‘experiencing physical violence’ (1 %) were less often reported when using cryptomarkets compared with sourcing through friends (14 %; 6 %), known dealers (24 %; 10 %) or strangers (35 %; 15 %). Concerns about drug impurities and law enforcement were reported more often when using the alternative source, while loss of money, waiting too long and not receiving the product were more often reported when using cryptomarkets. Conclusion Cryptomarkets are associated with substantially less threats and violence than alternative market types used by <b>cryptomarket</b> customers, even though {{a large majority of}} these alternatives were closed networks where violence should be relatively less common...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores {{activism}} enacted through Silk Road, a nowdefunct <b>cryptomarket</b> where {{illicit drugs}} {{were sold in}} the darkweb. Drawing on a digital ethnography of Silk Road, we developthe notion of constructive activism to extend the lexicon ofconcepts available to discuss forms of online activism. Monitoringof the <b>cryptomarket</b> took place between June 2011 and its closurein October 2013. Just {{before and after the}} closure of themarketplace we conducted anonymous online interviews with 17 people who reported buying drugs on Silk Road (1. 0).

Forparticipants Silk Road was not just a market for trading drugs: itfacilitated a shared experience of personal freedom within alibertarian philosophical framework, where open discussionsabout stigmatized behaviours were encouraged and supported. Tensions between public activism against drug prohibition andthe need to hide one’s identity as a drug user from public scrutinywere partially resolved through community actions thatinternalized these politics, rather than engaging in forms of onlineactivism that are intended to have real-world political effects.

40|$|<b>Cryptomarkets</b> are online marketplaces {{that are}} part of the Dark Web and mainly devoted to the sale of illicit drugs. They combine tools to ensure {{anonymity}} of participants with the delivery of products by mail to enable the development of illicit drug trafficking. Using data collected on eight <b>cryptomarkets,</b> this study provides an overview of the Canadian illicit drug market. It seeks to inform about the most prevalent illicit drugs vendors offer for sale and preferred destination countries. Moreover, the research gives an insight into the structure and organisation of distribution networks existing online. In particular, we provide information about how vendors are diversifying and replicating across marketplaces. We inform on the number of listings each vendor manages, the number of <b>cryptomarkets</b> they are active on and the products they offer. This research demonstrates the importance of online marketplaces in the context of illicit drug trafficking. It shows how the analysis of data available online may elicit knowledge on criminal activities. Such knowledge is mandatory to design efficient policy for monitoring or repressive purposes against anonymous marketplaces. Nevertheless, trafficking on Dark Net markets is difficult to analyse based only on digital data. A more holistic approach for investigating this crime problem should be developed. This should rely on a combined use and interpretation of digital and physical data within a single collaborative intelligence model...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The popularization of {{anonymous}} markets such as Silk Road is challenging current drug policy and {{may provide a}} new context for old issues, such as adulteration of heroin with fentanyl derivatives. The aims of this paper are to report the presence of ocfentanil, a novel, potent, non-controlled fentanyl analog, in samples sold as heroin in the hidden web, and to summarize the effects reported by users. METHODS: In 2015, four samples allegedly bought as heroin in <b>cryptomarkets</b> of the hidden web were sent to Energy Control for analysis. Energy Control is a Spanish harm reduction NGO that offers anonymous drug checking {{with the purpose of}} adapting counselling to the specific substances present in the drug and monitor the drug market. Identification was performed by GC/MS and LC/MS/MS. We contacted the submitters of the samples and performed an Internet search to retrieve additional information. RESULTS: One sample contained ocfentanil, caffeine and heroin. Three samples contained the aforementioned substances plus paracetamol. Two out of the four contacted users reported distinct short acting, opioid-like effects. No fora discussion could be found about the effects of ocfentanil, neither web pages nor individuals advertising the substance. CONCLUSION: We report the presence of a new substance detected in the hidden web as an adulterant of heroin, ocfentanil. It has short acting opioid-like effects, roughly the same potency as fentanyl, and can be injected, snorted or smoked. Severe side effects have been associated with its use, including one death. No discussion about this substance could be found in the Internet, which suggests this substance has not been sold as such. Available data about purities of drugs purchased in <b>cryptomarkets</b> suggest that adulteration is not a severe problem and this agrees with users' perceptions. However, this study suggests that adulteration is a real threat not only at the street level, but also for users that buy substances in <b>cryptomarkets,</b> and suggest the need for harm reduction initiatives in this setting...|$|R
40|$|Background The continual {{diversification}} of new psychoactive substances (NPS) circumventing legislation creates {{a public health}} and law enforcement challenge, and one particularly challenged by availability on Hidden Web cryptomarkets.

An internal site search was conducted on two cryptomarkets popular with NPS vendors and hosting fora; Alphabay and Valhalla, using the search terms of 40 popular NPS in the seven categories of stimulant/cathinone; GABA activating; hallucinogen, dissociative, cannabinoid, opioid and other/unspecified/uncategorised NPS. 852 identified threads relating to the discussion of these NPS were generated. Following exclusion of duplicates, 138 threads remained. The Empirical Phenomenological Psychological method of data analysis was applied. Four themes and 32 categories emerged. Results 120 vendors selling NPS were visible on Alphabay, and 21 on Valhalla. Themes were ‘NPS Cryptomarkets and Crypto-community interest in NPS’ ‘Motives for NPS use’ ‘Indigenous Crypto Community Harm Reduction’ and ‘Cryptomarket Characteristics underpinning NPS trafficking’, with two higher levels of abstraction centring on ‘NPS vendor reputation’ and ‘NPS transactioning for personal use’. NPS <b>cryptomarket</b> characteristics centred on generation of trust, honesty and excellent service.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a {{proliferation}} of online illicit markets where participants can purchase and sell a wide range of goods and services such as drugs, hacking services, and stolen financial information.

30|$|As {{drug markets}} move online, they become reconfigured once more. The most {{significant}} change is that {{suppliers and customers}} do not meet face to face (in most cases). Transactions are made online using digital currencies, and the drugs are sent in the post (Hillebrand et al. 2010). This means that controlling and building a local custom base becomes less important for suppliers as drugs can be delivered to people across large geographical distances, from a single fixed location. <b>Cryptomarkets</b> anonymise stakeholder activity through the TOR browser which bounces digital communications through various relays across the world. Online drug markets are generally less violent as distributors identities can be concealed (Aldridge and Décary-Hétu 2014).|$|R
30|$|The {{anonymity}} {{of the internet}} creates new problems for distributors as it allows others {{to compete in the}} virtual space without fear of violent reprisals. In this environment, distributors compete for customers by providing a superior service (at least as their customers see it) and building their brand (Aspers 2011; Aldridge and Décary-Hétu 2014). Websites on the clear net are different from <b>cryptomarkets</b> as they do not usually have the same ranking systems in place. Instead, suppliers rely on written feedback on user forums to build positive reputations. Those with greater resources can employ well known respected actors in their field to promote their goods. In this respect, the illicit market begins to resemble the licit one; the major difference is that these sites are illegal and cannot go to the courts for dispute adjudication. This creates further issues if customers do not pay for their goods or competitors copy and counterfeit their brand.|$|R

40|$|This chapter explores {{transnational}} online policing and {{the global}} digital divides that remain wedded to national governance theories, regulatory structures and surveillance practices, largely emanating from the Global North (Carrington, Hogg, and Sozzo 2016).

This chapter demonstrates how the ensuing transnational ‘information feudalism’ (Drahos and Braithwaite 2002) also produces a form of transnational legal feudalism that reflects power disparities between other English-speaking nations that are commonly viewed {{as part of the}} Global North in other areas of criminological inquiry (Milivojevic, Segrave and Pickering 2016), yet are played out in distinct ways through US extraterritorial policing and online surveillance.

The article also analyses the implications Silk Road has for drug consumers and law enforcement, as well as the potential changes to drug distribution networks that are likely to occur if Silk Road and other cryptomarkets continue to assume a greater share of the global trade in illicit drugs.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of large-scale cooperation in humans poses a major puzzle {{for the social}} and behavioural sciences. Reputation formation—individuals’ ability to share information about others’ deeds and misdeeds—has been found to promote cooperation. However, these findings are mostly based on small-scale laboratory and field experiments or on data gathered from online markets embedded in functioning legal systems. Using a unique data set of transactions in a <b>cryptomarket</b> for illegal drugs, we analyse the effect of buyers’ ratings of finished transactions on sellers’ business success. Cryptomarkets are online marketplaces in the so-called Dark Web, {{which can only be}} accessed by means of encryption software that conceals users’ identities and locations. The encryption technology makes it virtually impossible for law enforcement to intervene in these market exchanges. We find that sellers with a better rating history charge higher prices and sell their merchandise faster than sellers with no or a bad rating history. Our results demonstrate how reputation creates real incentives for cooperative behaviour at a large scale, in the absence of law enforcement and among anonymous actors with doubtful intentions. Our results thus challenge the institutional and social embeddedness of actors as necessary preconditions for the {{emergence of}} social order in markets...|$|E
30|$|Organised {{crime is}} a market-based {{activity}} in which buyers and sellers interact to purchase and distribute illicit goods and services. Illicit drug markets have been variously characterised as being open, semi-open, or closed. In open markets, distributors usually operate from a fixed location, such as a street corner, and sell openly to most people wishing to buy their goods. In closed markets, distributors will only sell to trusted individuals who have been previously vetted. Semi-open markets fall somewhere between the two and relate to spaces such as nightclubs, bars or <b>cryptomarkets.</b> Before the emergence of ICT, transactions were made face to face through spoken communication. In this respect, {{it was important for}} drug dealers to be in an area where customers knew they would be. This mode of working was significantly risky as being in a fixed location made dealers easy targets for the police. With the advent of the mobile phone, distributors could be more mobile and arrange transactions in advance leading to a more closed networked economy (May and Hough 2004; Wainwright 2016).|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cryptomarkets are digital {{platforms}} {{that use}} anonymising software (e. g. Tor) and cryptocurrencies (e. g. Bitcoin) to facilitate peer-to-peer (P 2 P) trade {{of goods and}} services. Their emergence has facilitated access {{to a wide range}} of high-quality psychoactive substances, according to surveys of users. In this paper, we ask the question 2 ̆ 7 How does changing access to drugs through cryptomarkets affect the drug use and harm trajectories of their users? 2 ̆ 7 METHODS: We conducted a digital ethnography spanning 2012 - 2014, a period that included the seizure of the original Silk Road marketplace and forum by law enforcement. Using encrypted online chat, we interviewed 17 people who reported using Silk Road to purchase illicit drugs. The interviews were in-depth and unstructured, and also involved the use of life history timelines to trace trajectories. Transcripts were analysed thematically using NVivo. RESULTS: For some, Silk Road facilitated initiation into drug use or a return to drug use after cessation. Typically, participants reported experiencing a glut of drug consumption in their first months using Silk Road, described by one participant as akin to 2 ̆ 7 kids in a candy store 2 ̆ 7. There was evidence that very high availability reduced the need for drug hoarding which helped some respondents to moderate use and feel more in control of purchases made online. <b>Cryptomarket</b> access also appeared to affect solitary and social drug users differently. Most participants described using other cryptomarkets after the closure of Silk Road, albeit with less confidence. CONCLUSION: In the context of high levels of drug access, supply and diversity occurring within a community regulated environment online, the impacts of cryptomarkets upon drug use trajectories are complex, often posing new challenges for self-control, yet not always leading to harmful outcomes. A major policy challenge is how to provide support for harm reduction in these highly volatile settings...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, Internet has been {{established}} as a place for drug markets to expand into a new reality and develop according to new business opportunities. Silk Road {{is one of many}} cryptomarkets that have succeeded online, offering a wide selection of drugs on global level. This thesis deals with the structural aspect of Silk Road and how it is organized, with theories of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari as a theoretical perspective to catch the complexity. Data has been collected through observations of Silk Road 2. 0, the second edition of the Silk Road market concept. More than a thousand screen shots have been captured and hundreds of pages with forum conversations printed to give a complete understanding of the market structure. The online environment has made huge changes in the structure of drug markets, where new opportunities have been offered and restrictions created. As a facilitator of communication without hardly any spatial or timely limits, the Internet has become a place to establish connections around the world. Cryptomarkets are deriving advantages from this new context and have established themselves as a meeting point for entrepreneurs, consumers, and other people wanting drug related information. Markets such as Silk Road are offering an anonymous marketplace and forum where people can stay without being connected to their physical self. This might lead to a more socially equal market, but one cannot ignore existence of online restrictions and risks. The lack of face-to-face contact challenges Silk Road when it comes to trust and security – how can anything be secure when the participants are unidentifiable? Silk Road solves this insecurity by introducing a feedback system and encouraging social interaction to increase the trust level. Leaving feedback has left the consumers with a major power to affect the market; bad comments and rumors are hurtful for the vendors, who in return offer the buyers great customer service to avoid negative feedback. Silk Road s forum is also important because of how the vivid interaction leads to a closer community bond that heightens the level of trust. The closeness among the participants is also increased by similar motivations and goals, which steers the market in a specific direction following the participants lead. But it is still the administrator that enforces rules and delegates roles. Silk Road might seem as a free market, but after a closer look one discovers restrictions and formal boundaries. The restrictions, though, are not involuntarily enforced, but rather desired by the participants {{in order to keep the}} market more stable. Morally decisions such as banning the sale of weapons are taken collectively and forum hierarchies are revealing the level of experience – all to induce trust into the market. Additionally, formal rules are an attempt of creating order, which does increase the trust, but it also seems to leave the participants with a false security. Role divisions are not as formal as they might seem, especially since all the participants can interact in multiple activities crisscrossing their appointed tasks. This is where Deleuze and Guattari s rhizome theory becomes particularly useful. According to their theory, social structures are based on a multitude of connecting nodes and other unnatural attempts to create order. Silk Road s rules and role divisions are accepted as organizing elements in the market, but it is also important to look beyond them to see the chaos that really exists. Nothing is as simple as ordering structures such as binary opposites and hierarchical structures; they need to be placed in a larger rhizomatic structure to see the many connections. Also, this opens up for acceptance of elements from the general society as important influences on Silk Road s structure. Cryptomarkets would not exist without the development of networked technologies and constraints set by law enforcement agencies. Media also has an impact on creating the <b>cryptomarket</b> reality adding to the participants experience and influence on the market structure. Silk Road is also tightly connected to the physical world through drug supplies and postal services. The structure of Silk Road is a complex rhizome, where elements of hierarchical settings and role divisions are important for its totality. But so is also the interplay between different connections both inside and outside the online market. Silk Road is a place for entrepreneurs to enter a structured environment and act as a collective group, while still keeping their individuality. Therefore, the complex structure of Silk Road resembles a controlled entrepreneurial market, where chaos and multiplicity lingers under the seemingly formal structure...|$|E
