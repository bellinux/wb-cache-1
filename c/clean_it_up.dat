5|$|Leterrier had {{to direct}} four units {{with a broken}} foot. Filming began on July 9, 2007. Shooting {{primarily}} took place in Toronto, because mayor David Miller is a Hulk fan and promised to be very helpful to the crew when closing Yonge Street for four nights in September to shoot Hulk and Blonsky's climactic fight. Despite messing up the street with explosives and overturned burning vehicles, the crew would <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> within twenty minutes so business could continue as normal each day. The first action sequence shot was the Culver University battle, which was filmed at the University of Toronto and Morningside Park. The filmmakers built a glass wall over a walkway at the University for when the soldiers trap Banner inside to smoke him out. There was also shooting in the Financial District. A factory in Hamilton, Ontario, which was due for demolition, was {{the interior of the}} Brazilian factory. The site's underground floors were used for Ross' military command center. The crew also shot part of the Hulk and Blonsky's fight on a backlot in Hamilton. Other Canadian locations included CFB Trenton and a glacier in Bella Coola, British Columbia. Afterwards, there was a week-long shoot in New York City and two weeks in Rio de Janeiro. While there, the crew shot at Rocinha, Lapa, Tijuca Forest and Santa Teresa. Filming concluded in November after eighty-eight days of filming.|$|E
5|$|Social worker Elena Rosas (Charise Castro Smith) {{is found}} shot {{dead in a}} motel. When Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) looks through her autopsy scan, she notices Elena had brain surgery and gets a shock when she realizes that Elena {{was one of her}} {{patients}} as she used to be a neurosurgeon, however she cannot remember her, just the procedure. Megan speaks with Elena's father Armando (Tony Plana), who remembers Megan from the surgery, and tells her that Elena saw Megan as a role model, due to Elena's mother early death. After speaking with Elena's boss Jeremy Nicholls (Edoardo Ballerini), he states that he cannot understand why Elena was in a motel, as she had no appointments near that location. Traces of breast milk are found on Elena's shirt, showing she was near a baby when she died, which leads them to Holly Bennett (Yaya DaCosta), one of Elena's clients. She reveals that her baby nearly got taken away due to her drug addicted boyfriend, and that whilst Elena was visiting her baby vomited on her, but left in a hurry before she could <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> Megan and Detective Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) visit Armando to ask if Elena was in a relationship; hence why she was in a motel. They find out that it is Jeremy, but he says that Elena ended their relationship hours before she died.|$|E
25|$|The North Brooklyn Boat Club has {{led many}} {{projects}} related to nearby bodies of water. It has hosted free public canoe trips on the East River and Newtown Creek; boat building and restoration, performed weekly water quality testing; performed mycoremediation on Newtown Creek in order to <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> from pollutants; and formed a Newtown Creek Armada to clean the polluted Newtown Creek. The club has also participated in environmental activities, such as gardening and composting; creating an environmental education center (Ed Shed) hosting birdwatching tours; performed wildlife monitoring; created a Living Dock for local fauna; and mapped balloons in the area.|$|E

25|$|As a pilot project, the Trillium Line {{system was}} {{built at the}} cost of $21 million, {{relatively}} little compared with {{the hundreds of millions of}} dollars usually required to build a new transit line. It runs on an existing Canadian Pacific Railway track (Ellwood and Prescott subdivisions,) so the only construction work necessary was to build the stations themselves and the passing tracks necessary to allow trains to operate in both directions. The downside to this, however, is that much ground pollution remains from the track’s previous use. This will become a liability one day when the city has to pay to <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> which it has thus far avoided by not digging into the ground under the tracks.|$|E
25|$|For this episode, Shin Bora, Heo Young-ji and Block B's Park Kyung {{appeared}} as special panelists. In between announcements of each girl's ranking {{during the first}} elimination, {{events leading up to}} the elimination are shown. Just after arriving at the dorms, the girls are taken to get flu shot. Weeks after, they are weighed and do a series of exercises with the help of trainer Ray Yang. Some girls are put on a strict diet in order to lose weight. The trainees are also tricked into participating in a 'hidden camera'. The first is a consideration test to see who will help a staff struggling with two heavy packs of water bottles. The second is a puddle of coke which was spilled {{on the floor of a}} waiting room to see if they will <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> The third is a $30,000 camera which a staff pretends to break during a fake interview. The staff tells each trainee that she might get fired, and some girls take responsibility, pretending it was them who broke it. The 97 trainees choose the 'top visual'. Pledis Entertainment's Zhou Jieqiong takes first place while Jung Chae-yeon, Kim Do-yeon, Kim Se-jeong, Kim Ji-sung, Seo Hye-lin, Park Si-yeon, Kwon Eun-bean, Ki Heui-hyeon (Cathy), Lee Su-hyun, and Jeon So-mi takes 2nd to 11th place respectively. Jang Keun-suk then announces the top 20 trainees and finally the 61st and last trainee, Happy Face Entertainment's Hwang A-young, who was saved from elimination.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Illustrated Daily News {{was founded}} in 1923 by Cornelius Vanderbilt IV, who wished {{to start his own}} {{newspaper}} chain. The young Vanderbilt had served as a news reporter in New York for four years, but had no experience running a paper. Believing the best newspaper was a democratic one, he offered voting rights to those who would pay $5 for a year's subscription to his newspaper. [...] Repudiating the legendary adage of William Henry Vanderbilt, [...] "The public be damned," [...] Vanderbilt announced that the paper's philosophy would be [...] "The public be served." [...] Vanderbilt ignored attempts by the newspaper moguls who dominated Los Angeles journalism, William Randolph Hearst and Harry Chandler, to warn him off. Denied advertising in other newspapers, Vanderbilt attempted to gain publicity for his paper by having trucks drive through the streets bearing the paper's banner, and [...] hiring boys to chalk the paper's name on sidewalks, much to the annoyance of landowners who had to <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 2008, while 343 Industries {{was still}} in formation, Microsoft {{approached}} Starlight Runner Entertainment to help assemble the [...] "Halo bible". [...] Starlight Runner is a New York-based company that specializes in creating and producing transmedia franchises. Their job was to examine all content of the Halo universe, <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> and make it coherent and understandable for the people involved {{with the creation of}} Halo games and media. Frank O'Connor, a content manager at Bungie, assisted the team with the creation of the [...] "Halo bible" [...] before moving to 343 Industries to become Halo franchise development director. Unlike the original trilogy, the story for Halo 4 was designed {{to be part of a}} multi-game arc from the beginning. In addition, 343 Industries aimed for [...] "a more complete connectivity between all of their future media than before"; relating Halo 4s story to the Forerunner Saga and Kilo-Five Trilogy novels as well as using terminals in Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary to introduce background knowledge on the Forerunners.|$|E
500|$|During {{the shoot}} {{of the first}} part of [...] "End of Nights", Kindler loaned his car for a car chase sequence. A later scene {{involved}} having the car shot at by snipers. To prevent damage to the car, the bullet holes were made from visual effects. In [...] "Pavor Nocturnus", the crew had to make the Sanctuary set ruined in a post-apocalyptic state. Set designer Bridget McGuire made the set look [...] "horrible" [...] overnight, but then had to <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> for the last scene. They also [...] "completely trashed" [...] the street sets in the studio. [...] "Next Tuesday" [...] was considered a bottle episode as it was largely filmed in one set, a water tank some 14 feet deep and 70 feet long, in a studio. The episode was filmed over five 13-hour days, not including a two-day break midway through, becoming the fastest time filming a Sanctuary episode. Wood directed the episode from the water rather than dry land. The following episode [...] "Penance" [...] was largely filmed at a constructed city set some three and a half blocks in size, which was previously used in the superhero film Watchmen.|$|E

2500|$|In the US {{there has}} been a {{mechanism}} for taxing polluting industries to form a Superfund to remediate abandoned sites, or to litigate to force corporations to remediate their contaminated sites. Other countries have other mechanisms and commonly sites are rezoned to [...] "higher" [...] uses such as high density housing, to give the land a higher value so that after deducting cleanup costs there is still an incentive for a developer to purchase the land, <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> redevelop it and sell it on, often as apartments (home units).|$|E
2500|$|Charles Jenkins {{wrote in}} his book The Reluctant Communist that Abshier had {{difficulty}} conversing in Korean but was fascinated by words and would spend hours studying high-level vocabulary from newspapers. Jenkins reported that the four were moved into a one-room house in Mangyongdae-guyok in June 1965, where they lived together {{for several years and}} were forced to read and memorize passages by Kim Il Sung. Jenkins asserted that Dresnok would bully Abshier at this time, for example, by making a mess and then demanding that Abshier <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> Abshier was sympathetically characterized by Jenkins as [...] "a simple, sweet, good-hearted soul who {{was more than a little}} dumb and easy to take advantage of." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{graffiti}} became {{associated with}} crime, many {{demanded that the}} government take a more serious stance toward it, particularly after the popularization of the Fixing Broken Windows philosophy in 1982. By the 1980s, increased police surveillance and implementation of increased security measures (razor wire, guard dogs) combined with continuous efforts to <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> led to the weakening of the New York's graffiti subculture. As a result of subways being harder to paint, more writers went into the streets, which is now, along with commuter trains and box cars, the most prevalent form of writing. [...] But the streets became more dangerous due to the burgeoning crack epidemic, legislation was underway to make penalties for graffiti artists more severe, and restrictions on paint sale and display made obtaining materials difficult.|$|E
2500|$|Voiced by Bill Oddie, Grimbling is a [...] "dirty old man" [...] {{who often}} {{appears as a}} groundsman, butler, or some similar profession. Due to the {{limitations}} of an audio-only medium, {{the true nature of}} Grimbling is never revealed, but he is greeted with universal revulsion by all bar the audience. He memorably introduces himself in the 25th anniversary episode [...] "I am Grimbling, but don't worry, I'll <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> later." [...] In the same episode, Cleese asks him [...] "Aren't you a little past it, old man?" [...] with the response, [...] "No, I'm a little dirty old man". In the [...] "Robin Hood" [...] sketch in the 3rd series, Grimbling is in the employ of the Sheriff of Nottingham (Garden), who tells him, [...] "You have done well, Grimbling; take this tennis racquet for your services".|$|E
2500|$|The Protocols is a {{fabricated}} document {{purporting to}} be factual. Textual {{evidence shows that}} it could not have been produced prior to 1901. It is notable that the title of Sergei Nilus's widely distributed edition contains the dates [...] "1902–1903", and {{it is likely that the}} document was actually written at this time in Russia, despite Nilus' attempt to cover this up by inserting French-sounding words into his edition. Cesare G. De Michelis argues that it was manufactured in the months after a Russian Zionist congress in September 1902, and that it was originally a parody of Jewish idealism meant for internal circulation among antisemites until it was decided to <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and publish it as if it were real. Self-contradictions in various testimonies show that the individuals involved—including the text's initial publisher, Pavel Krushevan—purposefully obscured the origins of the text and lied about it in the decades afterwards.|$|E

2500|$|Butler’s field {{research}} in Maryland also influenced her writing of Kindred. She {{traveled to the}} Eastern Shore to Talbot County where she wandered a bit with little money and spent some time at the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore and the Maryland Historical Society. She also went {{on a tour of}} Mount Vernon, the home of America's first president, George Washington. This was the closest she could get to a plantation. On this tour, guides referred to the slaves as [...] "servants" [...] and avoided referring {{to the fact that the}} visitors were touring an old slave plantation. Butler also spent time reading emancipatory narratives, one of them being the slave narrative of Fredrick Douglass. Some of the facts she learned from these narratives were so grim that she realized that, in order to get people to read Kindred, she could not come close to presenting slavery as it was but had to <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} on All Things Considered, Yale University history professor Beverly Gage, {{who is writing a}} biography of Hoover, stated that the film accurately conveys that Hoover came to the FBI as a reformer seeking [...] "to <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> to professionalize it," [...] and to introduce scientific methods to its investigation, eventually including such practices as fingerprinting and bloodtyping. She praises DiCaprio for conveying the tempo of Hoover's speech. However, she notes that the film's central narrative device in which Hoover dictates his memoirs to FBI agents chosen as writers, is fictitious: [...] "He didn't ever have the sort of formal situation that you see in the movie where he was dictating a memoir to a series of young agents, and that that is the official record of the FBI." [...] Historian Aaron J. Stockham of the Waterford School, whose dissertation was on the relationship of the FBI and the US Congress during the Hoover years, wrote on the History News Network of George Mason University, [...] "J. Edgar portrays Hoover as the man who successfully integrated scientific processes into law enforcement investigations.... There is no doubt, from the historical record, that Hoover was instrumental in creating the FBI's scientific reputation." [...] Stockham notes that Hoover probably did not write the FBI–King suicide letter to Martin Luther King, Jr., as the film portrays: [...] "While such a letter was written, Hoover almost certainly delegated it to others within the Bureau." ...|$|E
