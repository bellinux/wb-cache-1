5|$|The {{growth in}} <b>computer</b> <b>crime</b> during the 1980s and 1990s caused law {{enforcement}} agencies to begin establishing specialized groups, usually at the national level, to handle {{the technical aspects of}} investigations. For example, in 1984 the FBI launched a Computer Analysis and Response Team and the following year a <b>computer</b> <b>crime</b> department was set up within the British Metropolitan Police fraud squad. As well as being law enforcement professionals, many of the early members of these groups were also computer hobbyists and became responsible for the field's initial research and direction.|$|E
5|$|In the UK {{the same}} laws {{covering}} <b>computer</b> <b>crime</b> can also affect forensic investigators. The 1990 computer misuse act legislates against unauthorised access to computer material; {{this is a}} particular concern for civil investigators who have more limitations than law enforcement.|$|E
5|$|Digital {{forensics}} (sometimes {{known as}} digital forensic science) is {{a branch of}} forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to <b>computer</b> <b>crime.</b> The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, {{and it was not}} until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.|$|E
40|$|Computer and {{communications}} networks have greatly enhanced the effectiveness and efficiencies of organizations.

In order to better under stand the nature of <b>computer</b> <b>crimes,</b> a comprehensive taxonomy of <b>computer</b> <b>crimes</b> is devel oped in this paper.

5|$|Convicted {{computer}} {{criminals are}} people who are caught and convicted of computer crimes such as breaking into computers or computer networks. <b>Computer</b> <b>crime</b> can be broadly defined as criminal activity involving information technology infrastructure, including illegal access (unauthorized access), illegal interception (by technical means of non-public transmissions of computer data to, from or within a computer system), data interference (unauthorized damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration or suppression of computer data), systems interference (interfering with the functioning of a computer system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or suppressing computer data), misuse of devices, forgery (or identity theft) and electronic fraud.|$|E
5|$|During the Article 32 hearing, the prosecution, led by Captain Ashden Fein, {{presented}} 300,000 {{pages of}} documents in evidence, including chat logs and classified material. The court heard from two Army investigators, Special Agent David Shaver, head of the digital forensics and research branch of the Army's <b>Computer</b> <b>Crime</b> Investigative Unit (CCIU); and Mark Johnson, a digital forensics contractor from ManTech International, {{who works for the}} CCIU. They testified that they had found 100,000 State Department cables on a workplace computer Manning had used between November 2009 and May 2010; 400,000 military reports from Iraq and 91,000 from Afghanistan on an SD card found in her basement room in her aunt's home in Potomac, Maryland; and 10,000 cables on her personal MacBook Pro and storage devices that they said had not been passed to WikiLeaks because a file was corrupted. They also recovered 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on Manning's MacBook hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Julian Assange. Two of the chat handles, which used the Berlin Chaos Computer Club's domain (ccc.de), were associated with the names Julian Assange and Nathaniel Frank.|$|E

Law enforcement has often pursued the authors of other malware, particularly viruses. However, few spyware developers have been prosecuted, and many operate openly as strictly legitimate businesses, though some have faced lawsuits.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1980s <b>crimes</b> {{involving}} <b>computers</b> were {{dealt with}} using existing laws. The first <b>computer</b> <b>crimes</b> were {{recognized in the}} 1978 Florida <b>Computer</b> <b>Crimes</b> Act, which included legislation against the unauthorized modification or deletion of data on a computer system. Over {{the next few years}} the range of <b>computer</b> <b>crimes</b> being committed increased, and laws were passed to deal with issues of copyright, privacy/harassment (e.g., cyber bullying, cyber stalking, and online predators) and child pornography. It was not until the 1980s that federal laws began to incorporate computer offences. Canada was the first country to pass legislation in 1983. This was followed by the US Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 1986, Australian amendments to their crimes acts in 1989 and the British Computer Misuse Act in 1990.|$|R

500|$|Since 2000, in {{response}} to the need for standardization, various bodies and agencies have published guidelines for digital forensics. The Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence (SWGDE) produced a 2002 paper, [...] "Best practices for Computer Forensics", this was followed, in 2005, by the publication of an ISO standard (ISO 17025, General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories). A European lead international treaty, the Convention on Cybercrime, came into force in 2004 with the aim of reconciling national <b>computer</b> <b>crime</b> laws, investigative techniques and international co-operation. The treaty has been signed by 43 nations (including the US, Canada, Japan, South Africa, UK and other European nations) and ratified by 16.|$|E

2500|$|When law {{enforcement}} agencies began making <b>computer</b> <b>crime</b> arrests in the 1990s, they would often ask judges for no knock search warrants, in order to deny their targets time to delete incriminating evidence from computers or storage media. In more extreme circumstances where it was likely that the targets could get advance notice of arriving police, judges would grant [...] "power-off" [...] warrants, allowing utilities {{to turn off the}} electricity to the location of the raid shortly beforehand, further forestalling any efforts to destroy evidence before it could be seized. These methods were effective against criminals who produced and distributed pirated software and movies, the primary large-scale <b>computer</b> <b>crime</b> of the era.|$|E
