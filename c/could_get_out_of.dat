5|$|On February 12, 2007, Bennett {{proposed}} using {{tax money}} to pay for a new $500 million arena in Renton, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. After failing to reach a deal {{by the end of the}} legislative session, Bennett gave up his attempt in April 2007. On November 2, 2007 the team announced it would move to Oklahoma City as soon as it <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> its Key Arena lease. Seattle's mayor, Greg Nickels, maintained a stance that the Sonics were expected to stay in Seattle until their lease expired in 2010 and said the city did not intend to make it easy for Bennett to move the team early. Over concerns the city would accept a buyout of the lease, a grassroots group filed a citywide initiative that sought to prevent the city from accepting such an offer from Bennett's group. The Seattle City Council later unanimously passed an ordinance modeled after the initiative.|$|E

25|$|The {{third wave}} also {{encountered}} severe flak, losing 6 aircraft. The troop carriers still made an accurate drop, placing 94 of 132 sticks on {{or close to}} the drop zone, {{but part of the}} DZ was covered by pre-registered German machine gun and mortar fire that inflicted heavy casualties before many troops <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their chutes. Among the killed were two of the three battalion commanders and the executive officer (XO) of the 3rd Battalion, 506th PIR.|$|E

25|$|By February, Berthold <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed. Eight days later, in mid month, {{he volunteered}} {{to return to}} command of Jagdgruppe 7. On 1 March, he {{reported}} to the medical office of Flieger-Ersatz-Abteilung 5 (Replacement Detachment 5) in Hannover. He was passed to return to command of Jagstaffel 18, but denied permission to fly. On 6 March, with his arm in a sling, he rejoined his old squadron at its new duty station. Within two days, on 8 March, Berthold had arranged for Hans-Joachim Buddecke's transfer into the unit to lead it in the air. Two days later, Buddecke was killed in action by Flight Lieutenant Arthur Whealy of the Royal Naval Air Service flying Sopwith Camel s/n B7220.|$|E
25|$|A Texas Historical Marker {{notes that}} in the 1870s Hardin hid out in the {{vicinity}} of Pilgrim, Texas. After the Bell County shootings, Hardin found refuge with his cousins, the Clements, who were then living in Gonzales in south Texas. They suggested he could make money by driving cattle to Kansas as a cowboy. Thinking he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Texas long enough for his pursuers to lose interest, Hardin worked with his cousins, rustling cattle for Jake Johnson and Columbus Carol. Hardin writes that he was made trail boss for the herd. In February 1871, while the herd was being collected for the drive to Kansas, a freedman, Bob King, attempted to cut a beef cow out of the herd. When he refused to obey Hardin's demand to stop, Hardin hit him over the head with his pistol. That same month, Hardin may have wounded three Mexicans in an argument over a Three-card Monte card game, pistol-whipping one man over the head, shooting one man in the arm, and shooting the third man in the lung.|$|E
25|$|In {{northern}} Italy, meanwhile, Catinat {{marched on}} Rivoli (with reinforcements from the Rhine and Catalan fronts), forcing the Duke of Savoy {{to abandon the}} siege and bombardment of Pinerolo (25 September – 1 October) before withdrawing to protect his rear. The resultant Battle of Marsaglia on 4 October 1693 ended in a resounding French victory. Turin now lay open to attack but further manpower and supply difficulties prevented Catinat from exploiting his gain, and all the French <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their victory was renewed breathing-space to restock {{what was left of}} Pinerolo. Elsewhere, Noailles secured the valuable sea port of Rosas in Catalonia on 9 June before withdrawing into Roussillon. When his opponent, Medina-Sidonia, abandoned plans to besiege Bellver, both sides entered winter quarters. Meanwhile, the French navy achieved victory in its final fleet action of the war. On 27 June Tourville's combined Brest and Toulon squadrons ambushed the Smyrna convoy (a fleet of between 200–400 Allied merchant vessels travelling under escort to the Mediterranean) as it rounded Cape St. Vincent. The Allies lost approximately 90 merchantmen with a value of some 30 million livres.|$|E

500|$|Fred Frith was a classically-trained violinist {{who turned}} to playing blues guitar while still at school. In 1967 {{he went to}} Cambridge University where he and fellow student, Tim Hodgkinson formed Henry Cow. While at University, Frith read John Cage's , which changed his {{attitude}} to music completely. He realised that [...] "sound, in and of itself, can {{be as important as}} ... melody and harmony and rhythm." [...] This changed his approach to the guitar, [...] "just to see what I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it", and initiated a long period of experimentation that continued throughout Frith's musical career.|$|E
500|$|Kawachi {{was laid}} down at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 1 April 1909.

On 3 October 1912, the ship was present when the battleship [...] had a fire that was started by a sailor in the forward magazine. It was flooded before the fire <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control and Kawachi sent over fire-fighting teams to assist Mikasas crew in case they were needed. When World War I began in August 1914, Kawachi was at Yokosuka.|$|E
500|$|The Colton Crossing was {{the site}} of one of the more notable frog wars in American {{railroad}} history. In the summer of 1882, tensions reached their boiling point when construction of tracks for the California Southern reached Colton, California. In an attempt to forcibly prevent the California Southern Railroad crews from completing construction, the Southern Pacific (SP) parked and then slowly moved a locomotive and gondola along the SP track at the location of the planned crossing. In addition, the SP hired armed men, including the famous Virgil Earp, to guard the tracks. Before the violence <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hand, Governor Robert Waterman [...] ordered San Bernardino County Sheriff J.B. Burkhart to enforce the state court order. Waterman personally ordered Earp and the crowd to comply with the court order. Earp backed down and told the SP engineer to move the locomotive. The crossing was built, ending the Southern Pacific's monopoly in Southern California.|$|E

500|$|The Conservatives {{did well}} in Atlantic Canada, gaining two seats in Newfoundland and nine in Nova Scotia, and {{sweeping}} Prince Edward Island's four seats. However, in Quebec, they gained only five seats as the province returned 62Liberals. The Tories gained 29seats in Ontario. Howe was defeated by Fisher, and told the media that some strange disease was sweeping the country, but as for him, {{he was going to}} bed. The Liberals still led by a narrow margin as the returns began to come in from Manitoba, and St. Laurent told Liberal minister Pickersgill that he hoped that the Tories would get at least one more seat than the Liberals so they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> an appalling situation. As the Tories forged ahead in Western Canada, Diefenbaker flew from Prince Albert to Regina to deliver a television address and shouted to Grosart as yet another cabinet minister was defeated, [...] "Allister, how does the architect feel?" [...] Late that evening, St. Laurent went to the Château Frontenac hotel for a televised speech, delivered before fifty supporters.|$|E
500|$|In late 1977, {{while in}} {{rehearsal}} {{for their next}} album, and {{just days before the}} band was set to enter the studio, Osbourne abruptly quit the band. Iommi called vocalist Dave Walker, a longtime friend of the band, who had previously been a member of Fleetwood Mac and Savoy Brown, and informed him that Osbourne had left the band. Walker, who was at that time fronting a band called Mistress, flew to Birmingham from California in late 1977 to write material and rehearse with Black Sabbath. On 8 January 1978, Black Sabbath made their only live performance with Walker on vocals, playing an early version of the song [...] "Junior's Eyes" [...] on the BBC Television programme [...] "Look! Hear!" [...] Walker later recalled that while in Birmingham he had bumped into Osbourne in a pub and {{came to the conclusion that}} Osbourne was not fully committed to leaving Black Sabbath. [...] "The last Sabbath albums were just very depressing for me", Osbourne said. [...] "I was doing it for the sake of what we <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the record company, just to get fat on beer and put a record out." [...] Walker has said that he wrote a lot of lyrics during his brief time in the band but none of them were ever used. If any recordings of this version of the band other than the [...] "Look! Hear!" [...] footage still exist, Walker says that he is not aware of them.|$|E

Siniora warned his supporters that the situation <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control. Lebanon's Army commander Gen.

Some women thought that they would gain freedoms denied to them in Japan and Korea. A quote from a Korean picture bride named Mrs. K embodies the mindset of many picture brides traveling to Hawaii, [...] "Hawaii's a free place, everybody living well. Hawaii had freedom, so if you like talk, you can talk, if you like work, you can work." [...] With the influx of women becoming picture brides, some women followed the trend as the thing to do. As one Japanese picture bride, Motome Yoshimura, explained, [...] "I wanted to come to the United States because everyone else was coming. So I joined the crowd." ...|$|E
2500|$|On lap 48, Senna pitted {{without giving}} up the lead. Like Mansell, Patrese was having {{problems}} with the gearbox in his Williams, and when it selected neutral midway through Turn Seven, it caused him to spin out of second place.

Piquet and Mika Häkkinen (making his F1 debut) barely managed to avoid him as they passed, but before Patrese <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the car, Moreno, in the second Benetton, went straight across the bow of the Williams, removing the nose of Patrese's car and the right front wheel of the Benetton. Neither driver was injured.

[...] Later on, Bradshaw was knocked {{out of the game}} when he took a knee-hit to the head by linebacker Monte Johnson. [...] A few plays later, Oakland recovered their fourth fumble of the day with 1:31 left in the game. [...] The Raiders then drove to the Pittsburgh 24-yard line, where they faced third down and 2 yards to go with 18 seconds left on the clock. They opted to have George Blanda kick a 41-yard field goal (his longest of the season and last of his NFL career) to pull the deficit to 6 points. Then Hubbard recovered the ensuing onside kick with 9 seconds remaining to give Oakland one last attempt to win the game. Cliff Branch then caught a 37-yard reception, but he was stopped at the Pittsburgh 15-yard line by Mel Blount before he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bounds and the clock ran out.
