5|$|In 1997, the Desert Inn {{underwent}} a $200 million renovation and expansion by Steelman Partners, {{giving it a}} new Mediterranean-looking exterior with white stucco and red <b>clay</b> <b>tile</b> roofs. The room count was reduced to 715 to provide more luxurious accommodations. The nine-story Palm Tower was completed, the lagoon-style pool was added, and notable changes {{were made to the}} Grand Lobby Atrium, Starlight Lounge, Villas Del Lago, and new golf shop and country club. The seven-story lobby, fully built in marble, was also {{a major part of the}} renovation.|$|E
25|$|The {{inner wing}} {{normally}} {{consisted of a}} living room, a kitchen and a wooden-floored central hall. More rooms may be attached to this. Poorer farmers would not have any outer wing. Floor heating (온돌, ondol) {{has been used in}} Korea since prehistoric times. The main building materials are wood, <b>clay,</b> <b>tile,</b> stone, and thatch. Because wood and clay were the most common materials used in the past not many old buildings have survived into present times.|$|E
25|$|Beyond {{the stone}} steps is the {{building}} complex, which was {{centered on a}} yard. The buildings had characteristic French <b>clay</b> <b>tile</b> roofing, the better to provide insulation and ventilation, and bitumen flooring. Continuous site improvements to accommodate {{the high number of}} migrants were carried out, including the installation of planked walls as room dividers by the late 1850s. By 1865, transportation needs led to the construction of a railway, cutting the Immigration Depot into two. Walls were constructed along the track.|$|E
50|$|The mosque is {{decorated}} with Japanese and English china <b>clay</b> <b>tiles</b> and used both methods of the Chinitikri application. One approach uses solid colour, cut <b>clay</b> <b>tiles</b> and form patterns through the placement of these coloured tiles in white plaster. The domes and the exterior surface are covered with different coloured star shaped China <b>clay</b> <b>tiles.</b> The upper portion of the eastern façade also incorporates a crescent motif.|$|R

25|$|The group {{commissioned}} architect Sumner P. Hunt of Hunt & Burns {{to design}} the new facility, which was designed in an Italian style with plaster facing and Italian <b>clay</b> <b>tile</b> roofing. The new facilities consisted of multiple structures covering a site 160 × 450 feet, surrounding a 65 × 120 foot patio area. The new facilities included a new 1,300-seat auditorium {{at the rear of}} the property facing 8th Street. The two-story structure facing Wilshire Boulevard houses the group's clubhouse, including a large lounge, art salon, and dining room. The dining room opens to a tile-roofed colonnade walkway and fountain.|$|E
25|$|A {{flue liner}} is a {{secondary}} barrier in a chimney {{that protects the}} masonry from the acidic products of combustion, helps prevent flue gas from entering the house, and reduces {{the size of an}} oversized flue. Newly built chimneys have been required by building codes to have a flue liner in many locations since the 1950s. Chimneys built without a liner can usually have a liner added, but the type of liner needs to match the type of appliance it is servicing. Flue liners may be <b>clay</b> <b>tile,</b> metal, concrete tiles, or poured in place concrete.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{building was}} designed by John Nunn and architect J.C. Berry. The 1-story concrete and brick building has a modified rectangular layout with a flat roof. [...] It features a flared tower over the gas station, and two canopies, one facing Route 66 and one facing Highway 83 over {{the front of the}} gas station office. In the rear, a second, shorter tower contained the restaurant. The main buildings were built of structural <b>clay</b> <b>tile</b> with terra-cotta glazed brick. The two towers are clad in stucco with decorative green and gold glazed terra-cotta tiles and cast concrete stepped forms. Designed {{to attract the attention of}} the passing motorists, the towers also feature geometric detailing, curvilinear massing, and are outlined with neon lighting added additional character and uniqueness to the building's design.|$|E

500|$|Warburton has two {{churches of}} note. St Werburgh's (...) is a timber framed church and a GradeI Listed Building, {{one of six}} in Trafford. Of the 29 timber framed churches that survive in England and Wales, St Werbugh's {{is one of the}} oldest. The church dates to at least the 14th century, and may be built on the site of an earlier Saxon chapel. It is rarely used for worship but is {{accessible}} to visitors. The church features an early-17th-century font, a Jacobean pulpit, and a 1645 altar. Nearby are the remains of the old village cross, complete with stocks whose wooden restraints are modern, though the supporting pillars are much older. The other church in Warburton, also dedicated to St Werburgh, was built in 1883 by John Douglas and is a GradeII Listed Building. The church is made of red sandstone with a <b>clay</b> <b>tile</b> roof.|$|E

However, {{this is the only}} liner which does not meet Underwriters Laboratories 1777 {{approval}} and frequently have problems such as cracked tiles and improper installation. Clay tiles are usually about [...] long, various sizes and shapes, and are installed in new construction as the chimney is built. A refractory cement is used between each tile.|$|E
2500|$|Located at {{the mouth}} of the Singapore River, the Empress Place Building's {{imposing}} Neo-Palladian exterior with timber-louvred windows and pitched <b>clay</b> <b>tile</b> roofs caught the attention of immigrants and visitors sailing into Singapore harbour.

2500|$|A {{small part}} of the {{southwest}} of the county (Sewardstone), is the only settlement outside Greater London to be covered by a postcode district of the London post town (...) [...] To the north of the green belt, with the exception of major towns such as Colchester, Chelmsford and Southend-on-Sea the county is rural, with many small towns, villages and hamlets largely built in the traditional materials of timber and brick, with <b>clay</b> <b>tile</b> or thatched roofs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second major}} repair effort {{involved}} the Stone House. [...] The 2011 Virginia earthquake struck {{the city on}} August 23, 2011, followed by Hurricane Irene on August 26–28. Some tombstones were toppled by the earthquake, and some trees fell over during the storm (damaging the stone angel in the Memorial Grove), but surprisingly little other damage occurred. Major leaks in the Stone House occurred during the hurricane, however, and a post-storm investigation revealed that the <b>clay</b> <b>tile</b> roof needed major repair. Further investigation showed that the leaks had rotted eaves and roof joists. The project, expected to cost $75,000, was completed on November 7, 2011, at a total cost of $129,500.|$|E
2500|$|The city, {{especially}} the historic center, has maintained its Spanish colonial layout, with narrow cobblestone streets, roofs covered in red <b>clay</b> <b>tile</b> and wrought iron balconies with flowers. The facades {{of the buildings}} vary from Baroque to Neoclassical and Moorish, painted in various colors. Milk delivery from local dairy farms still use canisters on donkeys, and farmers typically still use horses and donkeys for hauling wood and farmed goods within their own properties [...] The city subdivides into three sections {{but the majority of}} the population lives in the central section near the city center. Many of the surrounding hills have lost their native trees, in part due to cutting firewood and logging operations which feed the local manufacturing and construction industries.|$|E
2500|$|Shophouses are {{typically}} built with pitched roofs covered with orange <b>clay</b> roof <b>tiles.</b> Again, this marks an important {{shift away from}} the use of more organic coconut frond thatch (called [...] "attap") in traditional architecture. The added cost of <b>clay</b> <b>tiles</b> was borne due to their greater durability and especially their resistance to fire.|$|R

2500|$|The {{historic}} and architecturally significant buildings of Rockwell Field form the southeastern quadrant {{of what is}} today the Naval Air Station, North Island (NAS North Island). The buildings were designed in the Mission Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival Styles. The Kahn-designed Mission Revival Field Officers Quarters (later married officers quarters) are reinforced concrete-framed, in-filled with hollow terra cotta tile and finished in buff color stucco. Kahn's Mission Revival hangars (Buildings 501, 502 and 503 from 1918) are similar in materials with red <b>clay</b> <b>tile,</b> gabled roofs. They were built to the same plan: a rectangle, 135 feet by 70 feet, with 30 feet clear to the ceiling. A low, flat-roofed, lean-to {{on the east side}} of each contained offices. Located on the bluff edge at the North Island end of the Coronado-North Island causeway, the Army-Navy Gate House/Meter Room (Building 505, 1918; later Meter House) functioned as the gatehouse for both Rockwell Field and NAS San Diego. This group of buildings reflects the War Department's plan to create buildings that would be appropriate for Southern California, and illustrates Kahn's [...] "Spanish military" [...] design implemented at Rockwell Field.|$|E
50|$|This barn {{plan was}} {{promoted}} by the Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station. The <b>clay</b> <b>tile</b> used for the silo is unusual, because the United States government considered cement safer than tile. The government eventually paid many farmers to demolish their <b>clay</b> <b>tile</b> silos {{and replace them with}} cement, but the owners of this barn refused. Both the <b>clay</b> <b>tile</b> and the main barn components were shipped on the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway north from Fort Dodge and Albert Lea to the Eden Prairie area.|$|E

40|$|Roof coverings, {{particularly}} barrel tiles, {{have experienced}} significant damage {{over the last}} few years from storms, even weaker storms such as Category 1 Hurricane Wilma in 2005. Efforts have been made to ban mortar-set attachments in southern Florida in favor of adhesive sets. Moreover, some homeowners have generalized the poor performance of <b>clay</b> or concrete <b>tiles</b> in favor of one or the other. This study aims to address whether there is a significant difference in the uplift capacity and impact resistance of field and ridge <b>tiles</b> of <b>clay</b> and concrete with either mortar-set or adhesive-set attachments. The detailed experimental study revealed the strongest system to be concrete tiles with mortar, both for uplift capacity and impact resistance. Although concrete tiles bond to mortar much better than <b>clay</b> <b>tiles,</b> <b>clay</b> <b>tiles</b> adhere better to the foam adhesive. Concrete tiles were also shown to perform better than <b>clay</b> <b>tiles</b> when impacted by a traveling projectile. Test results do not support the ban on the use of mortar for hip and ridge tiles. It is suggested that any such ban on mortar should be limited to <b>clay</b> <b>tiles</b> only. The study also showed cyclic testing to more accurately represent the uplift capacity of tiles for real hurricane conditions. In contrast, the monotonic testing used by tile manufacturers across the industry was found to overestimate the uplift capacity of tiles by as much as 40 %. PublishedN/...|$|R
