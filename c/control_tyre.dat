25|$|Major format {{changes were}} made for 1999, with the {{incorporation}} of the endurance races into the championship. Control tyres {{were used for the}} first time, with Bridgestone selected as the supplier. The series was also renamed from the 'Australian Touring Car Championship' to the 'Shell Championship Series', by virtue of Shell's sponsorship of the category. Reverse-grid races were introduced for multiple rounds in 2000 before being confined to just the Canberra round for 2001. Also in 2001, compulsory pit stops were introduced at certain rounds and the Top Ten Shootout was used at all rounds. The <b>control</b> <b>tyre</b> supplier changed from Bridgestone to Dunlop in 2002 and the series name was changed to the 'V8 Supercar Championship Series' after Shell discontinued their sponsorship.|$|E

50|$|The {{cars had}} independent, double {{wishbone}} suspension {{in front and}} rear. Wheels were 18 inches in diameter. Slick Goodyear <b>control</b> <b>tyres</b> were 12 inches wide in front and 14 inches in rear.|$|R
50|$|All {{entrants}} in {{the series}} had to use <b>control</b> <b>tyres</b> from a single supplier. Since 1982, these were manufactured by Avon Tyres, which from the 2009 season onwards were re-branded as Cooper Tires, as Cooper became the championship's official title sponsor.|$|R
50|$|From 2008, the {{championship}} followed the Superbike World Championship in appointing Pirelli {{as the single}} <b>control</b> <b>tyre</b> supplier.|$|E

5000|$|... 2004 was {{the first}} season all bikes had to use control tyres, {{provided}} by Pirelli. Partly because of the <b>control</b> <b>tyre</b> rule, no factory bikes were entered by Japanese manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|The cars use 18-inch control wheels, {{produced}} by Rimstock and supplied by Racer Industries, and <b>control</b> <b>tyres</b> from Dunlop. The slick tyre {{is available in}} both hard and soft compounds, with teams required to use either or both compounds in each race, depending on the event. A grooved wet tyre is used in damp conditions.|$|R
50|$|The Privateers' Team Cup {{was open}} top Level 2 teams {{competing}} with <b>control</b> <b>tyres.</b> Points were awarded {{on the same}} basis as for the actual Championship however competitors were required to nominate eight rounds at which they would compete and only their best six results from those rounds would be retained towards the Cup award. Two-driver teams were permitted to pool their points into a combined score.|$|R
50|$|The cars use 'American Racer' <b>control</b> <b>tyres</b> on {{the outside}} rear. The cars are also {{restricted}} in what dampers can be used, to control costs. Cars can reach speeds of 80-90 mph around a quarter-mile oval, so most cars use large roof mounted aerofoils, {{similar to those found}} on American sprint cars, to create downforce on the corners and provide some extra cornering grip. Wings are not compulsory, and the benefit is not proven.|$|R
50|$|The {{motorcycles}} must {{be based}} on an air-cooled 2-valve Ducati twin-cylinder engine produced since 1992. The machines are allowed limited modifications. Most modifications are for safety reasons. The <b>control</b> <b>tyre,</b> which changed to a Dunlop Alpha 13 for the 2016 season, with Dunlop Wets also allowed.|$|E
50|$|While still {{following}} long-term plans to abandon class structures within V8 Supercar, a class was instigated for the 1998 Tickford 500 and FAI 1000 Classic endurance races allowing smaller teams to save considerable budget by running a Dunlop <b>control</b> <b>tyre,</b> indicated here by CT. Most teams, particularly the professional teams, preferred to race with freedom of tyre choice, {{indicated by the}} class OC.|$|E
50|$|Teams {{are allowed}} to use Formula Three chassis built after 1980 but before 2005. This allows teams to enter with cheaper equipment. The series uses a <b>control</b> <b>tyre</b> which all drivers must use. The tyres are {{supplied}} by Avon Tyres, whose parent company supply tyres to the British Formula 3 Championship. Engines will be 2 litre (2000cc) restricted engines also built between 1981 and 2005.|$|E
50|$|Hembery {{was born}} in Yeovil. His first job {{was working in the}} tyre {{industry}} for 20 years, working in research and development and later working in a commercial role. He was first employed by Pirelli in 1992. Hembery has worked as the CEO of Pirelli Asia Pacific and currently works in the supply of <b>controlling</b> <b>tyres</b> in the World Rally Championship since 2008 and has also become involved in Pirelli's operation in Formula One since the company supplied tyres to F1 teams {{at the start of the}} 2011 season.|$|R
50|$|AUSCAR: down spec-ed cars, {{closer to}} {{production}} specification with a <b>control</b> road <b>tyre,</b> The category comprised the Holden Commodore and Ford Falcon. After 1990/91, engines were restricted to 5.0L V8's.|$|R
50|$|The Moto2 class {{replaced}} the 250cc class for 2010. The original intention was for Moto2 bikes to run alongside the existing 250cc machinery, however the entry list consisted of Moto2 machines only. The new class aimed to be economical, with {{measures such as}} limiting electronics (which will be supplied only by FIM sanctioned producers), the ban of carbon-fibre brakes {{and the use of}} steel brakes only; however, there are no chassis limitations. All Moto2 bikes use a mandatory 600 cc Honda engine, which are prepared by Honda's European specialized tuner Ten Kate, and produces power of about 150 bhp. <b>Control</b> <b>tyres</b> for the new series were provided by Dunlop only, despite early intentions of leaving tyre specifications free.|$|R
50|$|The 2011 {{championship}} was {{run through}} New Era, {{but the majority}} of races were held with Hottrax Racing. The <b>control</b> <b>tyre</b> also changed to a Dunlop Sportsmax Qualifier, moving away from Pirelli for the first time. The finale at Oulton Park saw Class B rider Philip Wilcock take two wins and the championship by four points from Ron Jolley, who fell from a 20 second lead in the final race. Class A was won by Appleby 36 points above veteran Andy Challis.|$|E
50|$|Supersport {{regulations}} are much tighter than in Superbikes. The chassis of a supersport machine must remain largely as standard, while engine tuning is possible but tightly regulated. For instance, the displacement capacity, {{bore and stroke}} must remain at the homologated size. Modifying the bore and stroke to reach class limits is not allowed. As in World Superbike, a <b>control</b> <b>tyre</b> is used, although World Supersport regulations dictate that the tyres must be road legal and therefore slicks are not allowed.|$|E
50|$|To be {{eligible}} for World Supersport, a motorcycle must have a four stroke engine of between 400 and 600 cc for four cylinder, 500 and 675 cubic centimetres for triples and between 600 and 750 cc for twins and must satisfy the FIM homologation requirements.World Supersport regulations are much tighter than in World Superbike.

50|$|Tincknell then scored an {{emotional}} win at Silverstone from a double pole position. It {{was the first}} time the 21-year-old from Devon has scored maximum points in the championship and was also a landmark victory for the Carlin team that runs his Volkswagen-powered Dallara - it was the squad’s first-ever success in a non-reversed-grid race on the series’ <b>control</b> Hankook <b>tyres.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Beetle Challenge is a UK-based circuit racing {{championship}} for classic air-cooled Volkswagen Beetles. The general {{concept is}} to take any Beetle, of any age or model from the 40s through to 1303s, and with minimal restrictions, allowing parts from various years to be interchanged, {{and of course the}} cars being prepared to the MSA safety requirements (cage, restraints, fire system etc.) Essentially the cars must be air-cooled Beetles (any age and parts can be swapped between years and models), with a 15-inch x 6-inch max wheel size with a <b>control</b> <b>tyre.</b> Engines must be based on a Type 1 engine case, with no electronic fuel injection or ignition and no forced induction, with an unlimited capacity. Other regulations apply.|$|E
40|$|In {{assessing}} and <b>controlling</b> vehicle dynamics, <b>tyre</b> {{forces are}} the most important variables as they are the only point of interaction with the road. Estimating tyre forces is difficult for their nonlinear characteristics and most vehicle dynamics controllers are therefore based on indirect measurements as yaw rate. With the invention of tyre force sensors, direct measurement of tyre forces is possible. In this work, a tyre force based lateral vehicle dynamics controller is proposed. The controller, applying an independent steering correction, <b>controls</b> the lateral <b>tyre</b> forces so to better distribute the force on the four tyres. This is obtained equating the tyre utilization coefficients. The proposed controller is tested in a simulation environment using CarSim and Simulink...|$|R
50|$|The {{argument}} is {{made that the}} Ahab/Jezebel marriage was an affair of state that would only have occurred after Omri, Ahab's father, was firmly in control of his kingdom, and Ithobaal, Jezebel's father, was firmly in <b>control</b> of <b>Tyre</b> and Sidon. Omri and Ithobaal were both usurpers; neither was the member of a royal family before they took the throne, {{and so it is}} not reasonable that, before they became kings, an Israelite general would seek out a priest of Astarte in the kingdom of Tyre and Sidon to get a wife for his young son Ahab.|$|R

50|$|Pirelli is {{the only}} allowed tyre brand in the FIM World Superbike Championship since 2007 (along with its support classes, such as the Supersport World Championship).Pirelli has also been awarded the {{contract}} for the <b>control</b> <b>tyre</b> supply in the British Superbike Championship from 2008 until at least 2010.Pirelli were also the official tyre supplier of the World Rally Championship from 2008 to 2010, until the company withdrew to focus on its Formula 1 commitments. Pirelli returned to the championship in 2014, however they only supply tyres for a few private teams as Michelin is the major tyre supplier. Pirelli was also supplied Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series from 2008 until at least 2010 before replaced by Continental AG in 2011.
