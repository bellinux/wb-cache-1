50|$|Before the 1960s and 1970s, the {{prevailing}} interpretation of hadrosaurids like Edmontosaurus {{was that they}} were aquatic and fed on aquatic plants. An example of this is William Morris's 1970 interpretation of an edmontosaur skull with nonbony beak remnants. He proposed that the animal had a diet much like that of some modern ducks, filtering plants and aquatic invertebrates like mollusks and crustaceans from the water and discharging water via V-shaped furrows along the inner face of the upper beak. This interpretation of the beak has been rejected, as the furrows and ridges are more like those of herbivorous turtle beaks than the flexible structures seen in filter-feeding birds. Between the mid-1980s and {{the first decade of the}} 2000s, {{the prevailing}} interpretation of how hadrosaurids processed their food followed the model put forward in 1984 by David B. Weishampel. He proposed that the structure of the skull permitted motion between bones that resulted in backward and forward motion of the lower jaw, and outward bowing of the tooth-bearing bones of the upper jaw when the mouth was closed. The teeth of the upper jaw would grind against the teeth of the lower jaw like rasps, processing plant material trapped between them. Such a motion would parallel the effects of mastication in mammals, although accomplishing the effects in a completely different way. Work in the early 2000s has challenged the Weishampel model. A study published in 2008 by Casey Holliday and Lawrence Witmer found that ornithopods like Edmontosaurus lacked the types of skull joints seen in those modern animals that are known to have kinetic skulls (skulls that permit motion between their constituent bones), such as squamates and birds. They proposed that joints that had been interpreted as permitting movement in dinosaur skulls were actually cartilaginous growth zones. An important piece of evidence for Weishampel's model is the orientation of scratches on the teeth, showing the direction of jaw action. Other movements could produce similar scratches though, such as movement of the bones of the two halves of the lower jaw. Not all models have been scrutinized under present techniques. Vincent Williams and colleagues (2009) published additional work on hadrosaurid tooth microwear. They found four classes of scratches on Edmontosaurus teeth. The most common class was interpreted as resulting from an oblique motion, not a simple up-down or front-back motion, which is consistent with the Weishampel model. This motion is thought to have been the primary motion for grinding food. Two scratch classes were interpreted as resulting from forward or backward movement of the jaws. The other class was variable and probably resulted from opening the jaws. The combination of movements is more complex than had been previously predicted.Weishampel developed his model with the aid of a computer simulation.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the changes in the chewing rhythm before and after mandibular ramus {{osteotomy}} in patients with prognathism with and without asymmetry. Patients and Methods: We divided 12 men and 22 women with mandibular prognathism into groups on the basis of symmetry and osteotomy procedure. The duration of the <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle</b> was recorded preoperatively and postoperatively. The duration of the <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle</b> and coefficient of variation were compared between groups, and the differences were analyzed statistically. Results: No significant differences in each of 3 phases of the <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle</b> and total duration were found between groups on the basis of symmetry or osteotomy procedure. However, there were significant differences between the preoperative and postoperative coefficients of variation for the undeviated side in the asymmetry group (P =. 0037) and in the group undergoing sagittal split ramus osteotomy (P =. 0166).

The endpoints for each cow at both locations were calculated per day and included eating and rumination times, number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> related to eating and rumination, number of regurgitated cuds and number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> per cud. Air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, barometric pressure and precipitation were recorded.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Eating and {{rumination}} {{variables were}} recorded in 300 healthy lactating dairy cows of 3 different breeds (100 Brown Swiss, 100 Holstein-Friesian, 100 Swiss Fleckvieh cows). Eating and rumination variables were monitored during a 24 -h period using an automated system that recorded jaw movements via a pressure sensor integrated into the noseband of a halter. Phases of eating and rumination were reliably identified in the recordings based on typical patterns seen in previous studies. The variables analysed included duration of eating and rumination, number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> during eating and rumination, number of regurgitated cuds and number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> per cud. RESULTS: The cows ate {{for an average of}} 265 [*]±[*] 54 min and chewed 17, 077 [*]±[*] 3646 times per day. The duration of rumination was 441 [*]±[*] 71 min, there were 578 [*]±[*] 94 cuds per day and 55 [*]±[*] 10 <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> per cud. There were significant correlations (P[*]<[*] 0. 01) between duration of eating and number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> during eating (r[*]=[*] 0. 94), between duration of rumination and number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> per regurgitated cud (r[*]=[*] 0. 56) and between duration of rumination and number of regurgitated cuds per day (r[*]=[*] 0. 53).

The component of the <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle</b> that most influenced the increase in functional area was the lateral one.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the measurement reproducibility for a procedure evaluating the mastication process and to estimate the smallest detectable differences of 3 D kinematic and surface electromyography (sEMG) variables. Kinematics of mandible movements and sEMG activity of the masticatory muscles were obtained over two sessions with four conditions: two food textures (biscuit and bread) of two sizes (small and large). Twelve healthy adults (mean age 29. 1 years) completed the study. The second to the fifth <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle</b> of 5 bites were used for analyses. The reproducibility per outcome variable was calculated with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and a Bland-Altman analysis was applied to determine the standard error of measurement relative error of measurement and smallest detectable differences of all variables. ICCs ranged from 0. 71 to 0. 98 for all outcome variables. The outcome variables consisted of four bite and fourteen <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle</b> variables. The relative standard error of measurement of the bite variables was up to 17. 3 % for 'time-to-swallow', 'time-to-transport' and 'number of chewing cycles', but ranged from 31. 5 % to 57. 0 % for 'change of chewing side'. The relative standard error of measurement ranged from 4. 1 % to 24. 7 % for <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle</b> variables and was smaller for kinematic variables than sEMG variables. In general, measurements obtained with 3 D kinematics and sEMG are reproducible techniques to assess the mastication process. The duration of the <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle</b> and frequency of chewing were the best reproducible measurements. Change of chewing side could not be reproduced. The published measurement error and smallest detectable differences will aid the interpretation of the results of future clinical studies using the same study variables...|$|E
40|$|No general {{agreement}} exists regarding {{the effect that}} bolus size has on masticatory movement, probably because both the size and texture of food change during mastication. In this experiment, in order to clarify the effect of bolus size on masticatory movement, a food that does not change in size and texture – chewing gum – was chosen, {{and the relationship between}} bolus size and the <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle</b> was analyzed. Ten healthy subjects in their twenties were asked to chew pieces of softened chewing gum of four different sizes. For ten cycles, beginning with the fifth cycle of mastication, gape and masticatory width were calculated for the spatial parameter of the <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle,</b> and cycle time was calculated as the temporal parameter. The relationship between these parameters and the bolus size was investigated. As the bolus size increased, the spatial and temporal parameters increased. In addition, there was a positive correlation between the bolus size and each parameter. The influence of the bolus size was as follows: gape, r = 0. 91; masticatory width, r = 0. 79; and cycle time, r = 0. 74 (all, P < 0. 001). From these results it was concluded that the shape of the <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle</b> was altered {{by the size of the}} food bolus, and that the changes in sensory input from the peripheries greatly affected the masticatory movement...|$|E
40|$|Eating and {{rumination}} {{activities were}} evaluated in 10 Brown Swiss cows over 10 days, and the coefficients of variation (CV) {{were calculated for}} the investigated variables.

40|$|Background Eating and {{rumination}} {{variables were}} recorded in ten healthy cows over 5 days (group A) to generate reference intervals for comparison with the same variables recorded in ten cows in advanced pregnancy from ten days prepartum to ten days postpartum (group B). A pressure sensor integrated into the noseband of a halter recorded individual chewing movements. The endpoints calculated {{on a daily basis}} for each cow included duration of eating and rumination, number of eating and rumination phases, number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> during eating and rumination, number of regurgitated cuds and number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> per cud. Results The following reference intervals were established in the cows of group A: duration of eating, 212 to 394 min; number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> during eating 13 ` 101 to 26 ` 515; number of eating phases 10 to 24; duration of rumination 304 to 471 min; number of regurgitated cuds 366 to 611; number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> per cud 53 to 57; and number of rumination phases 9 to 18. In the cows of group B, duration of eating was 186 min and below the normal range ten days prepartum and decreased to 114 min on the day of calving, after which time it increased significantly to 266 min by day 10. The number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> during eating had the same profile as duration of eating. Duration of rumination was in the normal range except for the day of parturition. It varied from 329 to 391 min prepartum, decreased significantly to 214 min on the day of parturition and then more than doubled by day 10. The number of regurgitated cuds had a profile similar to the duration of rumination. The number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> per cud was lowest on the day before and the day of parturition and ranged from 45 to 61. Conclusions This study showed that eating and rumination variables decrease from ten days before parturition to a minimum on the day of parturition, after which time they increase...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{quantify}} swallowing threshold {{parameters of}} subjects with a moderate shortened dental arch dentition (SDA: missing molar teeth, but premolar teeth in occluding position and uninterrupted anterior regions) compared to subjects {{with a complete}} dental arch dentition (CDA). METHODS: Fourteen females with SDA (3 - 4 occlusal premolar units) and 14 females with CDA were instructed to chew silicone test 'food' (cubic particles with a total volume of 3 cm(3)). They spit it out the moment they felt the urge to swallow and the pulverized particles were collected. Swallowing threshold parameters were number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles,</b> time until 'swallowing', and median particle size of the pulverized particles as determined by sieving the food. Chewing tests were performed twice and outcomes were averaged. RESULTS: The number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> until 'swallowing' of subjects with SDA was approximately 1. 7 times (p< 0. 005) that of the controls and this took approximately 1. 6 times more time (p< 0. 01). The median particle size until 'swallowing' {{did not differ significantly}} between the groups, but demonstrated large individual differences. Regression analyses indicated that the ratio of median particle size until 'swallowing' of SDA and CDA becomes progressively unfavourable for SDA with increasing numbers of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with SDA pulverized test 'food' particles to sizes comparable to subjects with CDA, but chewed longer with more <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> until 'swallowing'. Higher numbers of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> were associated with increasing difference between SDA and CDA regarding the median particle size until 'swallowing'. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Compared to subjects with CDA, subjects with moderate SDA pulverize test food particles to comparable size by chewing longer before "swallowing". Therefore, overloading the digestive system by swallowing courser food particles is unlikely in SDA. Consequently, replacement of absent molars just to optimize chewing function is not advised...|$|R
40|$|This study characterises the jaw {{movements}} of the brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, from an analysis of microwear on the premolar and molar teeth. From 10 skulls of T. vulpecula, micrographs of tooth replicas which exhibitied progressive degrees of dental wear were examined for the location of wear facets and the orientation of striae on them. These data were transferred to transparencies overlying occlusal photographs of the jaws. Two movements, a vertical sectorial movement in the premolars segment and an anteromedial shearing and grinding stroke in the molar segment, were inferred. The directions of wear striations {{with respect to the}} sagittal plane supported the concept that the mandible rotates around the contralateral condyle from the working side. No evidence of balancing contact facets were found on the teeth of the contralateral side, in agreement with an anisognathous jaw movement. Videoradiographic observations of the <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle</b> of one brush-tailed possum confirmed that puncture crushing is employed early in the <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle,</b> followed by an anisognathous labiolingual transit of the mandibular molars.

The physical characteristics of the foods were quantified from force-deformation experiments. The flow rates of the saliva as obtained without stimulation, with Parafilm stimulation, and with chewing on the various foods were significantly correlated. An increase in <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle</b> duration, number of chewing cycles until swallowing, and time until swallowing was observed {{as a function of}} the volume of the food. More chewing cycles were required for Melba toast than for an equal volume of cake or cheese. This may be caused by the low water and fat percentage of the Melba toast. The number of chewing cycles and the time until swallowing significantly decreased when the Melba toast was buttered. The decrease may be caused by facilitation in bolus formation and lubrication of the food due to buttering the toast.

MethodsDentate participants (dentate-group) and edentulous patients with mandibular two-implant overdentures (IOD-group) were recruited. First, the dentate-group chewed three different types of two-coloured gum (gum 1 –gum 3) for 5, 10, 20, 30 and 50 <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles.</b> Subsequently the number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> with the highest intra- and inter-rater agreement was determined visually by applying a scale (SA) and opto-electronically (ViewGum©, Bland–Altman analysis).

Secondly, the dentate-group and the IOD-group were compared. ResultsThe dentate-group comprised 20 participants (10 female, 30. 3 ± 6. 7 years); the IOD-group 15 participants (10 female, 74. 6 ± 8. 3 years). Intra-rater and inter-rater agreement (SA) was very high at 20 <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> (95. 00 – 98. 75 %). Gums 1 – 3 showed different colour-mixing characteristics as a function of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles,</b> gum 1 showed a logarithmic association; gum 2 and gum 3 demonstrated more linear behaviours. However, the number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> could be predicted in all specimens from VOH (all p< 0. 0001, mixed linear regression models).

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to describe age- and consistency-related changes in the temporal characteristics of chewing in typically developing {{children between the ages of}} 4 and 35 months and adults using high-resolution optically based motion capture technology. Method: Data were collected from 60 participants (48 children, 12 adults) across 5 age ranges (beginners, 7 months, 12 months, 35 months, and adults); each age group included 12 participants. Three different food consistencies were trialed as appropriate. The data were analyzed to assess changes in chewing rate, chewing sequence duration, and estimated number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles.</b> Results: The results revealed both age- and consistency-related changes in chewing rate, sequence duration, and estimated number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles,</b> with consistency differences affecting masticatory timing in children as young as 7 months of age. Chewing rate varied as a function of age and consistency, and chewing sequence duration was shorter for adults than for children regardless of consistency type. In addition, the results from the estimated number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> measure suggest that chewing effectiveness increased with age; this measure was also dependent on consistency type.

We quantified masticatory performance, maximum voluntary bite force, muscle activity and <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle</b> duration before and after treatment. Masticatory performance and bite force of patients were compared with the results obtained for an age- and gender-matched group of subjects without TMD complaints. Furthermore, we determined possible changes in anamnestic and clinical scores from questionnaires (mandibular function impairment questionnaire; MFIQ), pain scores and clinical outcome measures. Maximum bite force significantly increased, although the values after treatment were still significantly {{lower than those of}} the subjects without TMD complaints. The corresponding electromyography values did not show significant change after treatment. The masticatory performance of the patients remained unaltered; patients chewed significantly less efficient than controls. The average duration of chewing cycles significantly decreased after treatment. We observed a significant improvement in MFIQ scores. During the clenching and chewing tasks, the visual analogue scale scores were significantly higher than before these tasks.

40|$|The {{relationships}} between muscle tensions, jaw motions, bite and joint forces, and craniofacial morphology {{are not fully}} understood. Three-dimensional (3 -D) computer models are able to combine anatomical and functional data to examine these complex relationships. In this paper we describe {{the construction of a}} 3 -D dynamic model using the anatomical (skeletal and muscle form) and the functional (muscle activation patterns) features of an individual pig. It is hypothesized that the model would produce functional jaw movements similar to those recordable in vivo. Anatomical data were obtained by CT scanning (skeletal elements) and MR imaging (muscles). Functional data (muscle activities) of the same animal were obtained during chewing by bipolar intramuscular electrodes in six masticatory muscles and combined with previously published EMG data. The model was driven by the functional data to predict the jaw motions and forces within the masticatory system. The study showed that it is feasible to reconstruct the complex 3 -D gross anatomy of an individual's masticatory system in vivo. Anatomical data derived from the 3 -D reconstructions were in agreement with published standards. The model produced jaw motions, alternating in chewing side, typical for the pig. The amplitude of the jaw excursions and the timing of the different phases within the <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle</b> were also in agreement with previously published data.

The aims of this study were to test the validity of ViewGum - a novel image analysis software for the evaluation of boli derived from a two-colour mixing ability test - and to establish a baseline graph for the representation of the masticatory efficiency in a healthy population. Image analysis demonstrated significant hue variation decrease as the number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> increased, indicating a higher degree of colour mixture. Standard deviation of hue (SDHue) was significantly different between all <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles.</b> Regression of the log-transformed values of the medians of SDHue on the number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> showed a high statistically significant correlation (r² = 0. 94, P < 0. 01). ViewGum eliminates drawbacks of previous two-colour chewing gum test methods by the simplicity of its application. The newly developed ViewGum software provides speed, ease of use and immediate extraction of clinically useful conclusions to the already established method of chewing efficiency evaluation and is a valid adjunct for the evaluation of masticatory efficiency with two-colour chewing gum...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{findings}} on the relation among the chewing pattern, the maximal biting force, the alveolar bone mineral content and the elbow muscles strength were discussed. The number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle</b> was significantly correlated to the occlusal contact area, maximal biting force and the alveolar bone mineral content. This may suggest {{that the number of}} mechanical stimulation from the chewing accelerate the remodeling of alveolar bone, which lead to the increase of the occlusal contact area, the maximal bite force and the alveolar bone density. The clenching of teeth increased the isometric strength of limb muscles via the soleus H-reflex. Using the occlusal sprint was worn in tooth crowding subject, the clenching of teeth increased the isometric strength of elbow muscles. This may interpret that the sprint has an effect of increasing occlusal contact area and to increase the elbow H-reflex. Further investigations must be directed toward the effect of the chewing and the tooth clenching on the physiology of oro-maxillary complex and body muscle function...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{complexity}} of human oral functional movements {{has not been}} studied in detail quantitatively, and only recently have studies begun to evaluate whether such movements contain sex-specific characteristics. Therefore, {{the purposes of this}} study were: (1) to quantify in detail the jaw movements and associated masticatory electromyographic activity occurring during gum chewing, and (2) to explore these data for evidence of sex specificity. Fourteen male and 17 female subjects participated in the study. Approximately 11 right- and 11 left-sided chewing cycles and associated masticatory electromyographic activity were sampled from each subject. The samples were quantified into 165 variables per <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle,</b> averaged to create a single multivariate vector for each subject, and then analyzed by a step-wise discriminant analysis. With a combination of 6 variables, a jackknifed cross-validation test found the probability of correct classification to be 93. 5 %. These findings support the hypothesis that masticatory jaw movements contain sex-specific features...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In equine {{dentistry}} periodontal diseases, especially periapical inflammation, {{are frequently}} occurring problems. Anachoresis {{is believed to}} be the most common cause for the development of such disorders. Nevertheless, there is still no substantiated explanation why settlement of pathogen microorganisms occurs in equine periodontal tissues. It is expected that excessive strains and stresses occurring in the periodontal ligament (PDL) during the horse’s <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle</b> might be a predisposing factor. In this study this assumption was examined by finite element (FE) analyses on virtual 3 -D models of equine maxillary and mandibular cheek teeth, established on the basis of μCT datasets. Calculations were conducted both under conditions of closing and power stroke. Results Results showed a uniform distribution of low stresses and strain energy density (SED) during closing stroke, whereas during power stroke an occurrence of high stresses and SED could be observed in the PDL near the alveolar crest and in periapical regions. Conclusion The concentration of forces during power stroke in these specific areas of the PDL may cause local tissue necrosis and inflammation and thus establish a suitable environment for the settlement of microorganisms. </p...|$|E
40|$|The type of {{attachment}} {{that is used}} in implant-supported mandibular overdentures may influence the retention and stability of the prosthesis and, thus, masticatory function. In this within- subject cross- over clinical trial, we examined the hypothesis that greater retention and stability of the overdenture improve the masticatory function. Eighteen edentulous subjects received 2 oral implants, a new overdenture, and, successively, 3 different suprastructure modalities: magnet, ball, and bar- clip. Masticatory performance, masticatory efficiency, and swallowing threshold were measured. The masticatory function significantly improved after implant treatment {{with each of the}} 3 attachments. We observed small differences in masticatory function among the 3 attachment types: slightly better masticatory performance with ball and bar- clip than with magnet attachments. The number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> until swallowing hardly decreased after implant treatment. We conclude that significantly better masticatory performance, combined with a slightly smaller number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> after implant treatment, results in smaller food particles being swallowed...|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} with mitochondrial disease, fatigue and muscle problems {{are the most}} common complaints. They also experience these complaints during mastication. To measure endurance of continuous mastication in {{patients with}} mitochondrial diseases, the 6 -min mastication test (6 MMT) was developed. This study included the collection of normal data for the 6 MMT in a healthy population (children and adults). During 6 min of continuous mastication on a <b>chew</b> tube <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> per minute, total amount of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> and the difference between minute 1 (M 1) and minute 6 (M 2) were collected in 271 healthy participants (5 - 80 years old). These results were compared with those of nine paediatric and 25 adult patients with a mitochondrial disease. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were collected directly after the test and after 5 min. A qualitative rating was made on masticatory movements. The reproducibility of the 6 MMT in the healthy population with an interval of approximately 2 weeks was good. The inter-rater reliability for the observations was excellent. The patient group demonstrated lower total amount of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> or had greater differences between M 1 and M 6. The 6 MMT is a reliable and objective test to assess endurance of continuous chewing. It demonstrates the ability of healthy children and adults to chew during 6 min with a highly stable frequency of mastication movements. The test may give an explanation for the masticatory problems in patient groups, who are complaining of pain and fatigue during mastication...|$|R
50|$|Stereotyped {{behavior}} can also refer to normal behaviors that show low variation. For example, mammalian <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> or fish capturing prey using suction feeding. Highly stereotyped movements {{may be due}} to mechanical constraint (such as the skull of a viper or fish, in which bones are mechanically linked), tight neural control (as in mammalian chewing), or both. The degree of stereotyping may vary markedly between closely related species engaging in the same behavior.|$|R
40|$|Mastication was {{evaluated}} {{in patients with}} bulbar myasthenia gravis and {{compared with that of}} patients with ocular myasthenia gravis, patients in remission who previously suffered from bulbar symptoms, and healthy controls. Bulbar myasthenia gravis may impair mastication due to weakness of the masticatory muscles. The aim {{of the study was to}} objectively evaluate the influence of myasthenia gravis on mastication. The subjects chewed a piece of breakfast cake and chewed 1 min on a piece of chewing gum. Surface EMG of the masseter muscle, temporalis muscle and jaw opener muscles was recorded. Statistical analysis revealed that bulbar patients produced significantly less EMG activity in the closing phase of a <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle</b> in both experiments. The EMG of the masseter muscle expressed as percentage of the maximum EMG during maximal clenching showed significantly higher values in the bulbar group than in the other groups. This was not found for the temporalis muscle. It was suggested that bulbar patients use a strategy of limited effort to produce a bolus that can be swallowed. The ocular patients and the patients in remission showed no subclinical impairments in muscle function during chewing...|$|E
40|$|After {{complete}} denture insertion, edentulous patients usually present transitory difficulties. This {{is one of}} the most critical stages of prosthetic treatment and it is strongly related to the prostheses acceptance. The aim of this study was to evaluate potential changes in the mandibular movement pattern related to insertion of the {{complete denture}} during the functional adaptation period. The kinesiograph instrument K 6 -I (Myotronics Research Inc., Seattle, WA) was used to evaluate eight edentulous patients that received conventional complete denture treatment. Recordings of opening and closure movement limits, movement velocity, postural rest position, <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle</b> and limits of eccentric movements were performed. Each patient was evaluated in four different stages: with the old dentures, immediately after insertion of the new dentures, and 30 days and 6 months after insertion of the dentures. The results showed that there were no remarkable changes in the mandibular motion patterns after insertion of the new dentures. It was suggested that the problems related to the process of utilization of new dentures are not strictly associated to the mandibular movement. Therefore, functional adaptation after denture insertion is not directly related to functional changes, but to the quality of the dentures and to individual features...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{feasibility}} of the Mastication Observation and Evaluation (MOE) instrument, dynamic ultrasound and 3 D kinematic measurements to describe mastication in children with spastic cerebral palsy and typically developing children. Masticatory movements during five trials of eating a biscuit were assessed in 8 children with cerebral palsy, spastic type (mean age 9. 08 years) and 14 typically developing children (mean age 9. 01 years). Differences between trials were tested (t-test) and the mastication of individual children with cerebral palsy was analyzed. MOE scores ranged from 17 to 31 (median 24) for the children with cerebral palsy and from 28 to 32 (median 31) for the typically developing children. There was an increased <b>chewing</b> <b>cycle</b> duration, a smaller left-right and up-down tongue displacement and larger anterior mandible movements for the trials (n= 40) of cerebral palsy children (p< 0. 000 for all comparisons) compared to the trials of typically developing children (n= 70). The MOE captures differences in mastication between individual children with cerebral palsy. The MOE items 'jaw movement' and 'fluency and coordination' showed the most similarity with the objective measurements. Objective measurements of dynamic ultrasound and 3 D kinematics complemented data from the MOE instrument...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the relationship between the flow rate of saliva and characteristics of the food. Therefore, we determined the rate of saliva secretion in 16 healthy subjects in rest and while chewing natural and artificial foods (toast with and without margarine, three sizes of breakfast cake, and Parafilm). We also determined the chewing rate, number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> until swallowing, and time until swallowing. The physical characteristics of the foods were quantified from force-deformation experiments. The results showed that the average at which mechanical failure occurred (yield force) was 1. 86 ± 0. 24 N for the breakfast cake and 16. 3 ± 1. 3 N for the melba toast. The flow rates obtained without stimulation and with Parafilm were significantly lower (P < 0. 001) than the flow rates obtained from chewing food. No differences in flow rate occurred between the natural foods. The flow rates of the saliva as obtained without stimulation, with Parafilm stimulation, and with chewing on the various foods were significantly correlated (P < 0. 05). There were no significant differences in chewing rate among the foods. The number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> and the time until swallowing significantly depended on the type or volume of the food...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to compare the}} main {{objective}} parameters of mastication among individuals with different body mass indexes. One hundred and sixty participants matched for gender and age were divided in the following groups according to their body mass index (BMI) : Obese group (30 ≤ BMI b 35), Overweight group (25 ≤ BMI b 30), normal range group (18. 5 ≤ BMI b 25) and underweight group (17 ≤ BMI b 18. 5). Each group was composed by forty subjects. The maximum bite force, the masticatory performance, chewing rate and three variables related to swallowing (number of <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles,</b> <b>chewing</b> time, and median particle size) were assessed in all groups. The oral conditions, including the number of teeth, number of occlusal units and salivary flow (unstimulated and stimulated) were also evaluated. Regardless of the BMI, males had a larger bite force and better masticatory and swallowing performances than females. They also chewed faster than females. Individuals of the obese group had the largest median particles sizes (both after 20 <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> {{and at the moment}} of swallowing), which indicates a less good masticatory performance. The median particle sizes were negatively correlated with the number of teeth and number of occlusal units in the obese group. We did not observe large differences in masticatory performance and swallowing variables among the four weight groups, although there was a tendency that individuals of the obese group swallowed larger particles. The results of this study do not support the existence of an “obese chewing style”...|$|R
40|$|Different {{studies have}} indicated, in open bite patients, that {{masticatory}} muscles tend {{to generate a}} small maximum bite force and to show a reduced cross-sectional area with a lower EMG activity. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the kinematics parameters of the <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> and the activation of masseters and anterior temporalis muscles of patients with anterior dental open bite malocclusion. There have been no previous reports evaluating both kinematic values and EMG activity of patients with anterior open bite during chewing. Fifty-two young patients (23 boys and 29 girls; mean age ± SD 11. 5 ± 1. 2 and 10. 2 ± 1. 6 years, respectively) with anterior open bite malocclusion and 21 subjects with normal occlusion were selected for the study. Kinematics parameters and surface electromyography (EMG) were simultaneously recorded during chewing a hard bolus with a kinesiograph K 7 -I Myotronics-Usa. The results showed a statistically significant difference between the open bite patients and the control group for a narrower chewing pattern, a shorter total and closing duration of the chewing pattern, a lower peak of both the anterior temporalis and the masseter of the bolus side. In this study, it has been observed that open bite patients, lacking the inputs from the anterior guidance, that are considered important information for establishing the motor scheme of the chewing pattern, show narrower chewing pattern, shorter lasting <b>chewing</b> <b>cycles</b> and lower muscular activation with respect to the control grou...|$|R
