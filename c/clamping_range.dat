The increase in net outward current during prolonged (5 - 20 s) step depolarizations (range - 70 to + 5 mV) following the application of TTX is time dependent, being maximal immediately following depolarization, and declining thereafter towards a steady value. To eliminate the possibility that this time-dependent current was due to inadequate voltage control of these multicellular preparations early during square clamp pulses, we also used slowly depolarizing voltage <b>clamp</b> ramps (<b>range</b> 5 - 100 mV/s) to ensure control of membrane potential.

Transcatheter technique is a viable alternative with promising results for inoperable patients. Sutureless bioprostheses have shown benefits in high-risk patients, such as reduction of aortic clamping and cardiopulmonary bypass, decreasing risks and adverse effects. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of this study was}} to experimentally evaluate the implantation of a novel balloon-expandable aortic valve with sutureless bioprosthesis in sheep and report the early clinical application. METHODS: The bioprosthesis is made of a metal frame and bovine pericardium leaflets, encapsulated in a catheter. The animals underwent left thoracotomy and the cardiopulmonary bypass was established. The sutureless bioprosthesis was deployed to the aortic valve, with 1 / 3 of the structure on the left ventricular face. Cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic clamping and deployment times were recorded. Echocardiograms were performed before, during and after the surgery. The bioprosthesis was initially implanted in an 85 year-old patient with aortic stenosis and high risk for conventional surgery, EuroSCORE 40 and multiple comorbidities. RESULTS: The sutureless bioprosthesis was rapidly deployed (50 - 170 seconds; average= 95 seconds). The aortic <b>clamping</b> time <b>ranged</b> from 6 - 10 minutes, average of 7 minutes; the mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 71 minutes.

40|$|Abstract Introduction: Optimal {{surgical}} {{management for}} acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) remains unclear. The in-hospital mortality rate is still high (15 %), and the intraoperative bleeding {{is an independent}} risk factor for hospital mortality. Objective: The aim of our study was describe a new method for aortic anastomosis in the repair of AAAD and report the hospital mortality and bleeding complications. Methods: Between January 2008 and November 2014, 24 patients, 16 male, median age 62 years, underwent surgical treatment of AAAD. The surgical technique consisted of intussusception of a Dacron tube in the dissected aorta, which is anastomosed with a first line of 2 - 0 polyester everting mattress suture and a second line of 3 - 0 polypropylene running suture placed at the outermost side. Open distal anastomosis was performed with bilateral selective antegrade cerebral perfusion in 13 (54. 1 %) patients. Results: Cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic <b>clamping</b> time <b>ranged</b> from 75 to 135 min (mean= 85 min) and 60 to 100 min (mean= 67 min), respectively. The systemic circulatory arrest ranged from 29 to 60 min (mean= 44. 5 min). One (4. 1 %) patient required reoperation for bleeding, due {{to the use of}} preoperative clopidogrel. The postoperative bleeding was 382 - 1270 ml (mean= 654 ml). We used an average of 4. 2 units of red blood cells/patient.

We characterized the transport activity and regulation by pH(i) of full-length AE 3 and the cardiac isoform, AE 3 c, {{both of which}} are expressed in the heart. AE 3 c is an N-terminal variant of AE 3. We also characterized AE 1, AE 2 and a deletion construct (AE 3 tr) coding for the common region of AE 3 and AE 3 c. AE proteins were expressed by transient transfection of HEK- 293 cells, and transport activity was monitored by following changes of intracellular pH or intracellular chloride concentration associated with anion exchange. Transport activities, measured as proton flux (mM H(+). min(- 1)), were as follows: AE 1, 24; AE 2, 32; full-length AE 3, 9; AE 3 c, 4 and AE 3 tr, 4. The wide range of transport activities is not explained by variation of cell surface processing since approx. 30 % of each isoform was expressed on the cell surface. pH(i) was <b>clamped</b> at a <b>range</b> of values from 6. 0 - 9. 0 to examine regulation of AE proteins by pH(i).

40|$|Based on the AFM-bending experiments, a {{molecular}} dynamics (MD) bending simulation model is established which could accurately {{account for the}} full spectrum of the mechanical properties of NWs in a double <b>clamped</b> beam configuration, <b>ranging</b> from elasticity to plasticity and failure. It is found that, loading rate exerts significant influence to the mechanical behaviours of nanowires (NWs). Specifically, a loading rate lower than 10 m/s is found reasonable for a homogonous bending deformation. Both loading rate and potential between the tip and the NW are found {{to play an important role}} in the adhesive phenomenon. The force versus displacement (F-d) curve from MD simulation is highly consistent in shapes with that from experiments. Symmetrical F-d curves during loading and unloading processes are observed, which reveal the linear-elastic and non-elastic bending deformation of NWs. The typical bending induced tensile-compressive features are observed. Meanwhile, the simulation results are excellently fitted by the classical Euler-Bernoulli beam theory with axial effect. It is concluded that, axial tensile force becomes crucial in bending deformation when the beam size is down to nanoscale for double clamped NWs. In addition, we find shorter NWs will have an earlier yielding and a larger yielding force. Mechanical properties (Young’s modulus & yield strength) obtained from both bending and tensile deformations are found comparable with each other. Specifically, the modulus is essentially similar under these two loading methods, while the yield strength during bending is observed larger than that during tension...|$|R
40|$|The lack of {{intraoperative}} {{haptic feedback}} limits {{the benefits that}} are associated with robotic minimally invasive surgery. The development of mathematical models to implement force information in surgical robots requires biological data describing the relationship between mechanical loading and consequential tissue damage. In this dissertation we aimed to quantify this relationship for aortic clamping, a procedure that is often crucial during surgery. We have shown that in vivo clamping of mouse thoracic aorta results in damage on both the functional and morphological level, which partly persists up to one month after the initial clamping injury. To investigate if implementation of patient-specific information is necessary in the developed models, we examined whether or not age and pathology influence the relation between clamping force and tissue injury. We observed a trend towards impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation in aging mice, Probably this difference in response would become significant when mice older than 40 weeks would be included in the study. Given the high prevalence of atherosclerosis in patients who need surgery, we also studied the effect of aortic clamping in a mouse model displaying atherosclerotic lesions (LDLR knockout mice fed western diet). We could not find a consistent genotype-based difference in response to arterial clamping at intima level. However, investigation of effects located in the tunica media showed that atherosclerotic arteries have a higher osteopontin score (synthetic smooth muscle cells) compared to wildtype vessels. Quantification of curvature showed more flattening of the innermost elastic membrane in response to clamping in atherosclerotic samples compared to wildtype segments. While flattening did occur in both genotypes, no recovery was observed in LDLR-/- arteries. These conclusions suggest that atherosclerotic arteries are more prone to medial damage, especially in the lighter <b>clamping</b> load <b>range.</b> Additionally, we observed a consistent rise in inflammatory cells (CD 45) after clamping. Interestingly, wildtype inflammation scores were higher than LDLR-/- levels in the intima, while media analysis showed an opposite pattern. We can conclude that in vivo clamping of arteries results in damage to the vessel wall, even when utilizing low clamp loads. While the comorbid factor aging did not affect the results significantly, atherosclerotic arteries respond differently to mechanical injury compared to healthy vessels. These results suggest that mathematical models to be implemented in surgical robots should account for possible pathology at the tissue of interest. This would improve safety during and after minimally invasive surgery. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Wire bonding {{as one of}} the {{dominant}} interconnection technologies is gradually predominated by copper wire as a result of higher performance with lower cost than gold wire. Heat affected zone (HAZ) was formed due to the thermal conductivity during wire melting and free air ball (FAB) solidifying for ball bonding. The influence of the grain growth and recrystallization accompanied with HAZ formation would make the HAZ properties significantly different from that of thermally stable zone. However, it is still unclear how the material properties change with the HAZ. In the present study, mechanical properties of HAZ affected by different electronic flame-off (EFO) parameters were investigated. The length of HAZ was identified {{based on the results of}} micro-Vicker hardness as well as the grain size change from SEM micrographs. A patent-pending design of silicon clamp, which was fabricated with lithography and deep reactiveion etching (DRIE), was used to conduct the tensile test of HAZ. Deflection test was employed to accurately measure the Young's modulus of the HAZ using the nano-indenter tip. The beam length was controlled by the silicon <b>clamps</b> in the <b>range</b> of the length of HAZ 10 m to make sure the Young's modulus was taken from the HAZ.

40|$|Postnatal {{inhibitory}} neuron development affects mammalian brain function, {{and failure}} of this maturation process may underlie pathological {{conditions such as}} epilepsy, schizophrenia and depression. Furthermore, understanding how physiological properties of inhibitory neurons change throughout development is critical to understanding the role(s) these cells play in cortical processing. One subset of inhibitory neurons that may be affected during postnatal development is somatostatin-expressing cells. A subset of these cells is labeled with green-fluorescent protein (GFP) {{in a line of}} mice known as the GIN line. Here, we studied how intrinsic electrophysiological properties of these cells changed in the somatosensory cortex of GIN mice between postnatal ages P 11 to P 32 +. GIN cells were targeted for whole-cell current <b>clamp</b> recordings and <b>ranges</b> of positive and negative current steps were presented to each cell. The results showed that as the neocortical circuitry matured during this critical time period, multiple intrinsic and firing properties of GIN inhibitory neurons, {{as well as those of}} excitatory (regular-spiking [RS]) cells, were altered. Furthermore, these changes were such that the output of GIN cells, but not RS cells, increased over this developmental period. We quantified changes in excitability by examining the input-output relationship of both GIN and RS cells. We found that the firing frequency of GIN cells increased with age, while the rheobase current remained constant across development. This created a multiplicative increase in the input-output relationship in the GIN cells, leading to increases in gain with age. The input-output relationship of the RS cells, on the other hand, showed primarily an additive shift with age, but no substantial change in gain. These results suggest that as the neocortex matures, inhibition coming from GIN cells may become more influential in the circuit and play a greater role in the modulation of neocortical activity...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to establish the basis for altered membrane excitability during the inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism in central mammalian neurons. Perforated whole-cell patch clamp and fluorimetric techniques were combined to examine changes in membrane currents, intracellular calcium ([Ca 2 +]i) and mitochondrial potential (ΔΨm) in neurons dissociated from the CA 1 subfield of the hippocampus of young rats. On application of the mitochondrial inhibitor NaCN, or the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), the membrane potential hyperpolarized and membrane conductance increased. Under voltage clamp, an outward current was seen. The reversal potential of the current at − 83 mV and its dependence on extracellular [K+] confirmed that this was a K+ conductance. Simultaneous recordings of [Ca 2 +]i and current showed a striking correlation between a rise in [Ca 2 +]i and the developed outward current. Flash photolysis of the caged Ca 2 + chelator, diazo- 2, reversed both the rise in [Ca 2 +]i and the outward current. The current was reduced by 80 % by charybdotoxin, was attenuated by 10 mm TEA+ but was unaffected by apamin or by the KATP channel blocker tolbutamide (400 μm− 1 mm). These data suggest strongly that the current is carried by Ca 2 +-dependent K+ channels. Simultaneous recordings of membrane current, ΔΨm and [Ca 2 +]i revealed the sequence of events in response to impaired mitochondrial function (CN, FCCP or anoxia) : ΔΨm depolarized, followed rapidly by an increase in [Ca 2 +]i followed in turn by the outward current. [Ca 2 +]i and membrane current recovered only after mitochondrial repolarization. The rise in [Ca 2 +]i appeared to result from an increased Ca 2 + influx through voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels. It was dependent on extracellular Ca 2 + and was much reduced by methoxyverapamil (D 600). The rate of Mn 2 + quench of fura- 2 fluorescence was increased by the inhibitors, and the inhibitors induced a small inward current when K+ channels were blocked that preceded the rise in [Ca 2 +]i. However, the increase in [Ca 2 +]i showed no obvious dependence on membrane potential in cells <b>clamped</b> at a <b>range</b> of holding potentials from − 90 to − 45 mV. Thus, removal of oxygen, uncoupling mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation or inhibition of respiration, all lead to mitochondrial depolarization, an increased Ca 2 + influx through (voltage-gated) channels, even at hyperpolarized membrane potentials, raising [Ca 2 +]i which in turn drives an increased K+ conductance that modulates membrane excitability...|$|R
