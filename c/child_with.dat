40|$|Background: The spoken {{language}} difficulties of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> moderate or severe to {{profound hearing loss}} are mainly related to limited auditory speech perception. However, degraded or filtered auditory input as evidenced in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> cochlear implants (CIs) may result in less efficient or slower language processing as well. To {{provide insight into the}} underlying nature of the {{spoken language}} difficulties in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> CIs, linguistic profiles of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> CIs are compared with those of hard-of-hearing (HoH) <b>children</b> <b>with</b> conventional hearing aids and <b>children</b> <b>with</b> specific language impairment (SLI). Aims: To examine differences in linguistic abilities and profiles of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> CIs as compared <b>with</b> HoH <b>children</b> and <b>children</b> <b>with</b> SLI, and whether the spoken language difficulties of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> CIs mainly lie in limited auditory perception or in language processing problems. Methods & Procedure: Differences in linguistic abilities and differential linguistic profiles of 47 <b>children</b> <b>with</b> CI, 66 HoH <b>children</b> <b>with</b> moderate to severe hearing loss, and 127 <b>children</b> <b>with</b> SLI are compared, divided into two age cohorts. Standardized Dutch tests were administered. Factor analyses and cluster analyses were conducted to find homogeneous linguistic profiles of the children. Outcomes & Results: The <b>children</b> <b>with</b> CIs were outperformed by their HoH peers and peers with SLI on most linguistic abilities. Concerning the linguistic profiles, the largest group of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> CIs and HoH children shared similar profiles. The profiles observed for most of the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> SLI were different from those of their peers with hearing loss in both age cohorts. Conclusions & Implications: Results suggest that the underlying nature of spoken language problems in most <b>children</b> <b>with</b> CIs manifests in limited auditory perception instead of language processing difficulties. However, {{there appears to be a}} subgroup of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> CIs whose linguistic profiles resemble those of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> SLI...|$|R

40|$|Reading {{comprehension}} and three aspects of working memory—general, visuospatial and phonological—was assessed in 41 <b>children</b> <b>with</b> hearing loss: 23 with cochlear implants and 18 with hearing aids. Performance on these tests was compared {{between the two}} groups of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> hearing loss and also related to that of 55 <b>children</b> <b>with</b> typical hearing. All children were between 6 and 14 years of age. The <b>children</b> <b>with</b> hearing aids performed significantly more poorly on the reading comprehension test than the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> typical hearing but this difference was not significant between the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> cochlear implants and the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> typical hearing. In the group of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> cochlear implants, the results from the reading test and the results from all three working memory tests correlated significantly, whereas in the group of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> hearing aids there was no correlation between the reading test and the visual working memory test.

Twenty-five percent of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> cerebral malaria, and 4 % of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> mild malaria had an elevated serum creatinine above 62 mumol/l. Increased urinary protein excretion was frequent: 53 % of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> cerebral malaria had a glomerulo-tubular pattern of protein excretion, and 46 % a tubular pattern. Median albuminuria was 68 mg/l in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> cerebral malaria, 18 mg/l in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> mild malaria, and 9 mg/l in febrile <b>children</b> <b>with</b> other diseases (P < 0. 0001).

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Health Professions, Dept. of Communication Sciences and DisordersChildren {{learn new}} words {{through a process}} termed fast-mapping, which {{involves}} pairing novel words and objects after minimal exposure (Carey & Bartlett, 1978). There have been studies conducted to understand the fast-mapping processes in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> typical development (TD); however, this phenomenon has received less attention for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In addition, no studies were found that investigated the eye-gaze patterns and fast-mapping abilities of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD and TD. Furthermore, research involving visual search tasks has suggested that <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD demonstrate superior visual search skills when compared to <b>children</b> <b>with</b> TD (O’Riordan, Plaisted, Driver, & Baron-Cohen, 2001). The {{purpose of this study}} was two-fold: (1) to compare the eye-gaze patterns of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD and TD in relation to fast-mapping; and (2) to compare the visual search abilities of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD and TD. Ten <b>children</b> diagnosed <b>with</b> ASD and twenty <b>children</b> <b>with</b> TD, ages 5 - 7 participated. Participants were matched on nonverbal intelligence and receptive vocabulary skills. The Tobii 1750 eye-tracking system was used to capture eye-tracking measures. Overall, the results of Study 1 revealed that <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD were able to fast-map novel images and text at a similar rate to <b>children</b> <b>with</b> TD, despite having fewer fixations and shorter total fixation duration on novel stimuli. Study 2 revealed that <b>children</b> <b>with</b> ASD had similar visual search patterns as compared to <b>children</b> <b>with</b> TD. <b>Children</b> <b>with</b> ASD demonstrated more errors when locating targets but exhibited similar reaction times compared to <b>children</b> <b>with</b> TD.
