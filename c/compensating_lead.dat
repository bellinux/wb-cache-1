40|$|High-stakes multidistrict litigations saddle the {{transferee}} {{judges who}} manage {{them with an}} odd juxtaposition of power and impotence. On one hand, judges appoint and compensate lead lawyers (who effectively replace parties’ chosen counsel) and promote settlement with scant appellate scrutiny or legislative oversight. But on the other, without the arsenal class certification once afforded, judges are relatively powerless to police the private settlements they encourage. Of course, this power shortage is of little concern since parties consent to settle. Or do they? Contrary to conventional wisdom, this Article introduces new empirical data revealing that judges appoint an overwhelming number of repeat players to leadership positions, which may complicate genuine consent through inadequate representation. Repeat players’ financial, reputational, and reciprocity concerns can govern their interactions {{with one another and}} opposing counsel, often trumping fidelity to their clients. Systemic pathologies can result: dictatorial attorney hierarchies that fail to adequately represent the spectrum of claimants’ diverse interests, repeat players trading in influence to increase their fees, collusive private deals that lack a viable monitor, and malleable procedural norms that undermine predictability. Current judicial practices feed these pathologies. First, when judges appoint lead lawyers early in the litigation based on cooperative tendencies, experience, and financial resources, they often select repeat players. But most conflicts do not arise until discovery and repeat players have few self-interested reasons to dissent or derail the lucrative settlements they negotiate. Second, because steering committees are a relatively new phenomenon and transferee judges have no formal powers beyond those in the Federal Rules, judges have pieced together various doctrines to justify <b>compensating</b> <b>lead</b> lawyers. The erratic fee awards that result lack coherent limits. So, judges then permit lead lawyers to circumvent their rulings and the doctrinal inconsistencies by contracting with the defendant to embed fee provisions in global settlements — a well recognized form of self-dealing. Yet, when those settlements ignite concern, judges lack the formal tools to review them. These pathologies need not persist. Appointing cognitively diverse attorneys who represent heterogeneous clients, permitting third-party financing, encouraging objections and dissent from non-lead counsel, and selecting permanent leadership after conflicts develop can expand the pool of qualified applicants and promote adequate representation. Compensating these lead lawyers on a quantum-meruit basis could then smooth doctrinal inconsistencies, align these fee awards with other attorneys’ fees, and impose dependable outer limits. Finally, because quantum meruit demands that judges assess the benefit lead lawyers’ conferred on the plaintiffs and the results they achieved, it equips judges with a private-law basis for assessing nonclass settlements and harnesses their review to a very powerful carrot: attorneys’ fees...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The present paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a low cost, highly accurate low capacitance measurement system that can be used over a range of 0 – 400 pF with a resolution of 1 pF. The range of capacitance may be easily altered by a simple resistance or capacitance variation of the measurement circuit. This capacitance measurement system uses quad two-input NAND Schmitt trigger circuit CD 4093 B with hysteresis for the measurement and this system is integrated with PIC 18 F 2550 microcontroller for data acquisition purpose. The microcontroller interacts with software developed in the PC end through USB architecture and an attractive graphical user interface (GUI) based system is developed in the PC end to provide the user with real time, online display of capacitance under measurement. The system uses a differential mode of capacitance measurement, with reference to a trimmer capacitance, that effectively <b>compensates</b> <b>lead</b> capacitances, a notorious error encountered in usual low capacitance measurements. The hysteresis provided in the Schmitt-trigger circuits enable reliable operation of the system by greatly minimizing the possibility of false triggering because of stray interferences, usually regarded as another source of significant error. The real life testing of the proposed system showed that our measurements could produce highly accurate capacitance measurements, when compared to cutting edge, high end digital capacitance meters.

40|$|Local {{conservation}} efforts are often related to benefits at higher governmental levels. On the one hand, these efforts are strongly connected to local land-use decisions. On the other hand, {{activities such as}} sustainable water management or biodiversity conservation are associated with regional, national or even global public goods. Therefore spatial externalities or spillovers exist that if not adequately <b>compensated</b> <b>lead</b> to an underprovision of the public goods and services concerned. This article investigates intergovernmental fiscal transfers as an innovative instrument to compensate local jurisdictions for the ecological goods and services they provide across local boundaries. From a public finance perspective, fiscal transfers are a suitable instrument to internalise spatial externalities. However, most federal states pre-dominantly use this feature for social and economic public functions rather than ecological public functions. This article investigates {{the case of the}} ICMS-E that has first been intro-duced by a few states in Brazil during the 1990 s. Part of the revenue of this value-added tax is redistributed to the local level based on ecological indicators. In this way, the state level uses fiscal transfers to compensate municipalities for the existence of protected areas and other ecological services provided within their territory. The Brazilian experience illustrates that such fiscal transfers can represent both a compensation for land-use restrictions to be born and an incentive to appreciate and engage in more conservation activities at the local level.

The process of enquiry {{is embedded in}} a post modernistic ecosystemic perspective to elicit common themes {{in the health care}} workers’ (HCW) experiences of a Needle stick injury (NSI). Themes that emerged related mainly to the participants experience after having had a NSI. In the HCW environment HIV/AIDS is very well known disease. It is ironic that the HCW system at large is in denial regarding the dangers which the HCW’s face on a day to day basis working in a ‘mine field’ where every patient is a potential life threat to the HCW. From an ecosystemic stance one can clearly see the ecological principle at play. The HCW system seems to be stuck in a negative feedback process as the status quo is maintained by the defence/coping mechanisms. Adaptation seems to be limited. This inability to <b>compensate</b> <b>leads</b> to the disillusionment of the HCW who has to use ‘acceptable’ defence/coping mechanisms to deal with the trauma of being threatened by HIV/AIDS. The researcher found it constructive to use psychodynamic language, as defence mechanisms are psychodynamic concepts, to describe the process of the HCW system. As Keeney (1983) said that we are not surrounded, in a world of opposition, but rather in a realm of both/and dichotomies. The one cannot exit without, nor be discarded for, the other. Therefore, it could be suggested that an understanding of both systems and psychodynamic concepts may be a helpful tool in understanding and describing the processes of human interaction within an ecosystemic framework.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Insulin {{resistance}} in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue almost invariably occurs during obesity. To compensate, the insulin-producing β-cell increases insulin production by expanding cellular mass. The {{inability of the}} β-cell to fully <b>compensate</b> <b>leads</b> to hyperglycemia and ultimately type 2 diabetes. The enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) catalyzes the spermidine-dependent posttranslational modification of Lys 50 of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 A (eIF 5 A) to form hypusine (Hyp). Studies have demonstrated this modification of eIF 5 A to contribute to cellular proliferation in cancerous cells, but {{its role in the}} physiologic proliferation of islet β-cells is unknown. I hypothesized eIF 5 A-Hyp to be required for the proliferation of islet β cells during the early phase of insulin resistance, allowing the β-cell to respond to the increased demand for insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, deletion of DHS was induced post-developmentally in β-cells by crossing Dhs-fl/fl mice with MIP 1 -CreERT mice, and animals were fed for 1 or 4 weeks with a 60 % kcal from fat diet (HFD) or normal chow diet (NCD, 16 % kcal from fat diet). NCD-fed and HFD-fed animals had normal glucose homeostasis after one week feeding, regardless of genotype. However, after 4 weeks of HFD, KO mice had significantly worse glucose intolerance compared to control mice. eIF 5 A-Hyp levels increased in β-cells of control animals and as expected remained low in the KO mice. β-cell proliferation was significantly increased after 1 week of HFD as measured by PCNA staining, however KO mice showed no increase. Cyclin D 2 protein, but not mRNA, was increased in control animals fed a HFD; this protein increase was not observed in KO animals. Furthermore, polyribosomal profile of isolated islets of 1 week HFD-fed mice showed the Ccnd 2 mRNA bound to the monoribosome fractions in the KO animals compared to the controls, resulting in changes of global translation. Interestingly, Ccnd 1 polyribosome to monoribosome ratio showed no changes in translation compared to Ccnd 2.

For the degradation of the electrodes, which dominates the decrease of the performance and the change of the operation behavior, two different degradations processes are known: the agglomeration of the platinum catalyst and the degradation of the PTFE. The degradation of the PTFE leads to a lower hydrophobic character of the electrodes and influences the transport mechanisms resulting in a higher sensibility for the water balance. This degradation process can be partially compensated by changing of the operations conditions. However, the agglomeration of the catalysts cannot be <b>compensated</b> and <b>leads</b> to an irreversible decrease of the electrochemical performance. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the life time of the electrodes by selecting carefully the operation conditions minimizing the degradation processes, especially the agglomeration of the platinum based catalyst.

To further our understanding of dosage compensation in female heterogametic taxa and to resolve its status in the lepidopterans, we assessed the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella. As P. interpunctella lacks a complete reference genome, we conducted de novo transcriptome assembly combined with orthologous genomic location prediction from the related silkworm genome, Bombyx mori, to compare Z-linked and autosomal gene expression levels for each sex. We demonstrate that P. interpunctella lacks complete Z chromosome dosage compensation, female Z-linked genes having just over half the expression level of males and autosomal genes.

Two methodological approaches are used: switching regression and Markov-switching method. Although both approaches have different drawbacks which <b>compensate,</b> still both <b>lead</b> to the conclusion that inflation targeting represented a real switch in developing countries.

This is usually related to increases in hydrological fluxes as precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (E), and river discharge (R). It is under debate, however, whether such observed or reconstructed flux changes are real and on what scales. Large-scale increase or decrease of the flux deficit (P-E-R), i. e. flux changes that do not <b>compensate,</b> would <b>lead</b> to acceleration or deceleration of water storage anomalies potentially visible in GRACE data. In agreement with earlier studies, we do find such accelerations in global maps of gridded GRACE water storage anomalies over 2003 - 2012. However, these have been generally associated with interannual and decadal climate variability. Yet, we show that even after carefully isolating and removing the contribution of El Nino that partially masks long-term changes, using a new method, accelerations of up to 12 mm/yr 2 remain in regions such as Australia, Turkey, and Northern India. We repeat our analysis with flux fields from two global atmospheric reanalyses that include land surface models (ERA-Interim, MERRA-Land). While agreeing well with GRACE on shorter time scales, they fall short in displaying long-term trends corresponding to GRACE accelerations. We hypothesize {{that this may be}} due to time-varying biases in the reanalysis fluxes as noticed in other studies. We conclude that even though its data record is short, GRACE provides new information that should be used to constrain future reanalyses towards a better representation of long-term water cycle evolution...|$|R
40|$|Long-baseline {{interferometry}} detects fringes {{created by}} superposition of two beams of light collected by two telescopes pointing into a common direction. The external path difference generated by pointing {{away from the}} zenith is commonly compensated by adding a variable optical path length (delay) through air for one beam such that the optical path difference between the beams remains close to zero near the detector. The ABCD formula assigns a (wrapped) phase to the amplitudes A to D of an interference pattern shifted by multiples of 90 degrees in phase. We study the interplay between a wide band pass of the optics and the dispersion of {{the air in the}} <b>compensating</b> delay, which <b>leads</b> to small deviations between the ABCD phase and the reduced, monochromatic group-delay representation of the wave packets. In essence, this adds dispersion to the effects that have been discussed for evacuated interferometers (telescopes in space) before [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 22 (2005) 2774].

40|$|We have {{successfully}} grown (1 -x) Pb(Mg 1 / 3 -Nb 1 / 3) O 3 -xPbTiO 3 (PMN-PT) thin films with x = 0. 3, 0. 35 and 0. 4 by pulsed laser deposition. X-ray-diffraction studies {{reveal that the}} PMN-PT films grown on La 0. 5 Sr 0. 5 CoO 3 /LaAlO 3 substrates form epitaxial heterostructures. Composition control and remedial measures to <b>compensate</b> for the <b>lead</b> and magnesium losses due to re-evaporation are demonstrated. As a common feature, the as-grown PMN-PT thin films exhibit a self-poling behavior. Their dielectric constants measured at room temperature vary from 1500 to 2500, depending on the PMN to PT ratios. The pyroelectric coefficient of the films varies from 160 to 300 μC/m 2 K. The piezoelectric coefficient d 33 is around 27 pm/V in the as-grown 70 / 30 films. A comparison of these values with the bulk PMN-PT of same compositions implies that the much-reduced piezoelectric properties in the PMN-PT films are primarily due to a substrate-clamping effect.
