At a funeral home, Franks' body is cremated and the {{diamonds}} are {{passed on to}} another smuggler, Shady Tree.

King contemplated but ultimately decided against the proposal on the grounds that he felt uneasy with politics and considered himself better suited for his morally unambiguous role as an activist.|$|E

5|$|That night, Nicholas–now on {{the verge}} of insanity–hears Elizabeth calling him. He follows her ghostly voice down to her tomb. Elizabeth rises from her <b>coffin</b> <b>and</b> pursues Nicholas into the torture chamber, where he falls down a flight of stairs.

5|$|Unlike Hartnell's grave, {{the grave}} of Private William Braine was largely intact. When he was exhumed, the survey team saw signs that his burial had been hasty. His arms, body, and head had not been {{positioned}} carefully in the <b>coffin,</b> <b>and</b> one of his undershirts had been put on backwards. The coffin seemed too small for him; its lid had pressed down on his nose. A large copper plaque with his name and other personal data punched into it adorned his coffin lid.|$|E
5|$|After Speers' {{retirement}} in 1957, John Middaugh was minister from 1958 to 1968. Middaugh {{was a regular}} panelist for ten years on the weekly television program To Promote Goodwill, an interfaith discussion of social and religious issues produced by WBAL-TV and broadcast worldwide on the Voice of America. He {{was also in the}} forefront {{of the civil rights movement}} in the early 1960s. Along with William Sloan <b>Coffin</b> <b>and</b> dozens of other clergymen and civil rights activists, Middaugh was arrested in a clash with police at Baltimore's Gwynn Oak Amusement Park in July 1963 over efforts to desegregate the popular attraction.|$|E
5|$|Beattie and {{his team}} had noticed that someone else had {{attempted}} to exhume Hartnell. In the effort, a pickaxe had damaged the wooden lid of his <b>coffin,</b> <b>and</b> the coffin plaque was missing. Research in Edmonton later showed that Sir Edward Belcher, commander {{of one of the}} Franklin rescue expeditions, had ordered the exhumation of Hartnell in October 1852, but was thwarted by the permafrost. A month later, Edward A. Inglefield, commander of another rescue expedition, succeeded with the exhumation and removed the coffin plaque.|$|E

50|$|The modern {{use of this}} {{material}} {{may be said to}} have started then, but the use of fibrous plaster was known and practiced by the Egyptians long before the Christian era; for ancient <b>coffins</b> <b>and</b> mummies still preserved prove that linen stiffened with plaster was used for decorating <b>coffins</b> <b>and</b> making masks. Cennino Cennini, writing in 1437, says that fine linen soaked in glue and plaster and laid on wood was used for forming grounds for painting.|$|R

5|$|By {{the age of}} fifteen, Coffin {{was helping}} his family assist {{escaping}} slaves by taking food {{to those who were}} hiding on his family's farm. As the repressive Fugitive Slave Act became more rigorously enforced, the Coffin family began to assist slaves in greater secrecy, doing most of their illegal activities at night. Scrutiny of the abolitionists only worsened {{with the passage of the}} 1804 Black Laws. By the early 1820s Quakers in North Carolina were being openly persecuted for the assistance they were suspected of providing to runaway slaves. In 1821 <b>Coffin</b> <b>and</b> his cousin, Vestal, established a Sunday School to teach slaves to read the Bible, but the plan was short-lived; slaveholders soon forced the school to close.|$|E
5|$|In 1842 {{the leaders}} of the Society of Friends, the Quaker group to which Coffin belonged, advised their members to cease {{membership}} in abolitionist societies and end activities assisting runaway slaves. The leaders insisted that legal emancipation was the best course of action. Coffin continued to {{take an active role in}} assisting escaping slaves and the following year the Quaker society expelled him from membership. <b>Coffin</b> <b>and</b> other Quakers who supported his activities separated and formed the Antislavery Friends; the two rival groups remained separate until a reunification occurred in 1851.|$|E
5|$|In one of {{the more}} famous events of the {{underground}} railroad, Eliza Harris, a slave from Kentucky, crossed the Ohio River one winter's night when it froze over. She was aided in her escape by Levi Coffin of Fountain City, and eventually escaped to Ontario after being guided by Hoosiers from safe house to safe house through Indiana. Her story was the inspiration for the book Uncle Tom's Cabin. <b>Coffin</b> <b>and</b> his wife would help as many as two thousand slaves escape the South.|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} to make a single, definitive description of the folkloric vampire, though there are several elements common to many European legends. Vampires were usually reported as bloated in appearance, and ruddy, purplish, or dark in colour; these characteristics were often attributed to the recent drinking of blood. Blood was often seen seeping from the mouth and nose when one was seen in its shroud or <b>coffin</b> <b>and</b> its left eye was often open. It would be clad in the linen shroud it was buried in, and its teeth, hair, and nails may have grown somewhat, though in general fangs were not a feature. Although vampires were generally described as undead, some folktales spoke of them as living beings.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{under the}} streets of Sunnydale, The Master (Mark Metcalf), an ancient and {{powerful}} vampire king, is woken by lesser vampires from a long sleep {{to prepare for the}} Harvest. He sends Luke (Brian Thompson) to fetch young blood. Willow's new acquaintance takes her to a crypt in a cemetery, where they are joined by Darla and Jesse, whom she has bitten. Buffy and Xander arrive. Buffy kills Willow's vampire. Xander and Willow help the weakened Jesse to flee. Luke takes Darla's place in the fight so she can help catch the kids. Luke throws Buffy in a stone <b>coffin</b> <b>and</b> is about to move in for the kill.|$|E
5|$|Nelson's {{body was}} {{unloaded}} from the Victory at the Nore. It was conveyed upriver in Commander Grey's yacht Chatham to Greenwich {{and placed in}} a lead <b>coffin,</b> <b>and</b> that in another wooden one, made from the mast of L'Orient which had been salvaged after the Battle of the Nile. He lay in state in the Painted Hall at Greenwich for three days, before being taken upriver aboard a barge, accompanied by Lord Hood, chief mourner Sir Peter Parker, and the Prince of Wales. The Prince of Wales at first announced his intention of attending the funeral as chief mourner, but later attended in a private capacity with his brothers when his father George III reminded him that it was against protocol for the Heir to the Throne to attend the funerals of anyone except members of the Royal Family. The coffin was taken into the Admiralty for the night, attended by Nelson's chaplain, Alexander Scott. The next day, 9 January, a funeral procession consisting of 32 admirals, over a hundred captains, and an escort of 10,000 soldiers took the coffin from the Admiralty to St Paul's Cathedral. After a four-hour service he was interred in the crypt within a sarcophagus originally carved for Cardinal Wolsey. The sailors charged with folding the flag draping Nelson's <b>coffin</b> <b>and</b> placing it in the grave instead tore it into fragments, with each taking a piece as a memento.|$|E

5000|$|Work {{has been}} going on to {{carefully}} remove the <b>coffins</b> <b>and</b> the storage jars to KV10, which has adequate space for a conservation team to conduct a thorough examination and analysis of the <b>coffins</b> <b>and</b> jars in a proper, scientific manner. A pulley system was devised to facilitate the safe removal of the <b>coffins</b> <b>and</b> jars from the shaft. Grass buckets and bubblewrap were used to lift the jars out from the place where they were packed away for 3000 years. The removal of jars began on 2 March 2006 and most jars have been relocated safely along with one large sealed alabaster jar, which contained small pots packed in mud. Twelve of the storage jars have thus far been examined. Contents include natron, wood, seeds, shells, carbon, assorted pottery, small animal bones, papyrus fragments, mud trays, mud seals, and pieces of twine or rope. [...] Egyptologist Salima Ikram is supervising the removal and examination of the contents.|$|R
