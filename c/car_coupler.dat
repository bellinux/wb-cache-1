His brother, Louis Davidson Ricketts, {{achieved}} prominence as a mining engineer and in finance in New Mexico. Ricketts first arrived at RPI in 1871, at only fifteen years of age. During his junior year, {{he was a member}} of the editorial board which produced one of the more irreverent volumes of the Transit, the school yearbook. Immediately following his graduation in 1875, Ricketts was appointed as Assistant in Mathematics and Astronomy at RPI. He served as an assistant engineer for the Troy and Boston Railroad Company during the summers of 1876 and 1877, and was later elected a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Ricketts was promoted to Assistant Professor in 1882 and in 1884 became the William H. Hart Professor of Rational & Technical Mechanics, the first endowed chair at the Institute. Between 1881 and 1883 Ricketts obtained patents for the invention of an electromagnetic station indicator and a railway-car electrical circuit coupler, and in later years he was vice-president of the Trojan <b>Car</b> <b>Coupler</b> Company. He did research on testing materials, and in 1885 the English journal, Iron, reprinted an article by Ricketts from Van Nostrand’s Engineering Magazine on [...] "Physical Tests of Malleable Cast Iron, with Ten Tables." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The coupler is used {{to connect}} the vehicles, and to {{transfer}} and ease longitudinal force and impact force generated by the train running or shunting operation; hence it plays a vital role on vehicle-running safety. The parts of coupler are shaped by casting forming, with some forming error. The process of unlock, full open and lock, (three postures operation) are realized through the motion collision of these components. The forming error will influence the accuracy of coupler motion. However, there is no established theory or techniques to support the research towards {{the reliability of the}} motion. By making use of RecurDyn, simulation software for the 13 type coupler, authors carried out multi-body kinematics and dynamics modeling and simulation analysis, and predicted the up-lifter rod max not extract angle when the coupler is unlock with forming error. Meanwhile, authors established a basis process which contains construction and analysis of contact impact mechanism model, simulation geometry modeling, multi-body kinematics dynamics model and simulation analysis. All the efforts lead to one conclusion: the max up-lifter rod not extract angle is 25. 5 °,when the coupler is unlock. The outcome provides a simulation analysis method for predicting the motion veracity of railway freight <b>car</b> <b>coupler</b> with the features of space mechanism...|$|E
40|$|<b>Car</b> <b>coupler</b> {{forces have}} a {{significant}} effect on the longitudinal train dynamics and stability. Because the coupler inertia is relatively small in comparison with the car inertia; the high stiffness associated with the coupler components can lead to high frequencies that adversely impact the computational efficiency of train models. The objective of this investigation is to study the effect of the coupler inertia on the train dynamics and on the computational efficiency as measured by the simulation time. To this end, two different models are developed for the car couplers; one model, called the inertial coupler model, includes the effect of the coupler inertia, while in the other model, called the noninertial model, the effect of the coupler inertia is neglected. Both inertial and noninertial coupler models used in this investigation are assumed to have the same coupler kinematic degrees of freedom that capture geometric nonlinearities and allow for the relative translation of the draft gears and end of car cushioning (EOC) devices as well as the relative rotation of the coupler shank. In both models, the coupler kinematic equations are expressed in terms of the car body and coupler coordinates. Both the inertial and noninertial models used in this study lead to a system of differential and algebraic equations that are solved simultaneously in order to determine the coordinates of the cars and couplers. In the case of the inertial model, the coupler kinematics is described using the absolute Cartesian coordinates, and the algebraic equations describe the kinematic constraints imposed on the motion of the system. In this case of the inertial model, the constraint equations are satisfied at the position, velocity, and acceleration levels. In the case of the noninertial model, the equations of motion are developed using the relative joint coordinates, thereby eliminating systematically the algebraic equations that represent the kinematic constraints. A quasistatic force analysis is used to determine a set of coupler nonlinear force algebraic equations for a given car configuration. These nonlinear force algebraic equations are solved iteratively to determine the coupler noninertial coordinates which enter into the formulation of the equations of motion of the train cars. The results obtained in this study showed that the neglect of the coupler inertia eliminates high frequency oscillations that can negatively impact the computational efficiency. The effect of these high frequencies that are attributed to the coupler inertia on the simulation time is examined using frequency and eigenvalue analyses. While the neglect of the coupler inertia leads, as demonstrated in this investigation, to a much more efficient model, the results obtained using the inertial and noninertial coupler models show good agreement, demonstrating that the coupler inertia can be neglected without having an adverse effect on the accuracy of the solutio...|$|E
