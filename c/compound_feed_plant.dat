By rising commodity prices and energy costs for electric and thermal energy the <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> <b>plants</b> {{are forced to}} improve their processes. Significant savings are expected in the material changing refining stages. This paper, at first, gives an overview about the characteristics in the <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> production, followed by the analysis of high energy consumption.

40|$|The term {{traceability}} {{refers to}} recording of flow of products along {{the food chain}} from production to consumption with inclusion of all intermediate applications involved in processing/packaging stages. The aim for establishing traceability in the food chain is to provide the timely identification and recall of batches of product from the market when a risk threatens the health of consumers. Since <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> products are basic inputs in livestock and poultry production, ICT-based feed traceability systems {{can be considered as}} a initial step in food traceability management. These systems are simply information recording systems that are designed to trace and track the flow and characteristics of animal feed along the feed supply chain. This paper describes the architecture and some functional properties of a feed traceability system called as the â€œfeedTRaceâ€, focusing particularly on <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> and integrated poultry meat industries. The feedTRace aims to improve <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> supply chain management, to increase feed safety and quality control, and to gain marketing competencies with traceable products in <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> industry. The system is currently under beta stage, and is tested in two high capacity <b>feed</b> milling <b>plants</b> and an integrated broiler company located in Adana province of Turkey. <b>compound</b> <b>feeds,</b> feed traceability, traceability systems, food safety, Agricultural and Food Policy, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies, Teaching/Communication/Extension/Profession,...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} predict the true metabolizable energy (TMEn) of <b>compounded</b> starter <b>feeds</b> of broiler chickens trough their chemical composition using precision-feeding method of Sibbald in male boilers. In the first, eight <b>compounded</b> <b>feed</b> samples provided from eight <b>feed</b> <b>plants</b> and their chemical composition determined in laboratory. Results of chemical composition showed that average values of dry matter, crude protein, ether extract, crude ash, crude fiber, calcium and phosphorus were 90. 47, 20. 99, 2. 79, 2. 88, 6. 69, 1. 08 and 0. 49 percent, respectively with coefficient of variation between 2. 01 to 13. 29 percent. The average value of TMEn in <b>compounded</b> starter <b>feeds</b> was also obtained 3006 Kcal/kg with variation from 2884 to 3275 Kcal/kg and differences between them were significant. The variation between metabolizability values in the <b>compounded</b> <b>feeds</b> was 0. 7 to 0. 8 percent and differences between their values were not significant. The average value of dry matter true metabolizability in starter feeds was obtained as 54 percent and those having higher crude fiber, showed lower dry matter true metabolizability. The TME and TMEn values of <b>compounded</b> starter <b>feeds</b> showed a negative correlation as 0. 38 and 0. 59 percent with crude ash of feeds, so that the feeds containing higher crude ash had lower TME and TMEn values. Regression analysis showed that we can predict the TMEn value of broiler <b>compounded</b> starter <b>feeds</b> via regression equations from crude ash, crude protein, calcium and phosphorus contents of feeds from their crude ash, crude protein, calcium and phosphorus with R 2 value as 0. 67 (P= 0. 002) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the occurrence and levels of deoxynivalenol (DON), fumonisins B 1 and B 2 (FBs), and zearalenone (ZEN) contaminants in animal feeds used in Korea in 2012. Contamination with DON was observed in 91. 33 % and 53. 33 % in <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> and feed ingredients, respectively. Among <b>compound</b> <b>feeds,</b> poultry layer feed (laying) exhibited the highest contaminant level of 1. 492 mg/kg. FBs contaminants were present in <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> and feed ingredients at 93. 33 % and 83. 33 %, respectively. Most poultry broiler (early) feeds were highly contaminated with FBs, and one of these feeds detected the level as 12. 823 mg/kg as the highest level. The levels of ZEN in <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> and feed ingredients were 71. 33 % and 47 %, respectively.

40|$|International audienceA {{sandwich}} ELISA {{was developed}} {{for the detection of}} bovine meat and bone meal (BMBM) in feed, based on polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against the synthetic N-terminal amino acid sequence 1 - 9 (YLDHWLGAP) of bovine osteocalcin. To set up a sandwich ELISA pair, a commercial mouse monoclonal capture antibody binding to a highly conserved epitope in the mid-fragment of the peptide was employed. It is shown that the bone marker osteocalcin is immunologically well detectable in BMBM extracts obtained by a simple EDTA based procedure even in a sample heated up to 145 oC. Furthermore a genus-specific restriction of the major specificity to cattle and horse was possible. The observed bi-specificity is consistent with theoretical predictions. The assay sensitivity with bovine osteocalcin of 1 ng was sufficient to enable the detection of 0. 1 % BMBM in <b>compound</b> <b>plant</b> <b>feed</b> or fish meal, for which no cross reaction was observed. In general the quantification of osteocalcin in extracts is possible using a standard curve procedure with pure bovine osteocalcin...|$|R
40|$|Feeding {{dairy cattle}} with safe <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> helps farmers to ensure food safety. However, several {{ingredients}} {{often used in}} <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> production can be contaminated with aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1), which may result into milk contaminated with aflatoxin M 1. Given the number of ingredients and their amounts used {{in the production of}} <b>compound</b> <b>feed,</b> it is very costly to check every batch of ingredients for AFB 1 contamination. Which is the reason, why a risk-based approach is taken in the latest years. This study aimed to estimate the probability of AFB 1 contamination of <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> for dairy cattle, and to limit this contamination, by optimisation of the <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> formulation, using a modelling approach. The modelling approach comprised integrating a linear optimisation programming model to a Monte Carlo simulation model. This model was applied to the case of producing <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> for dairy cattle in the Netherlands, using national monitoring data on AFB 1 contamination in feed materials collected in the period 2000 - 2010.

40|$|There {{are small}} number of tables that show {{digestibility}} and energy contents of <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> produced by feed factory in different regions of Turkey. Thus, in this paper, four different <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> types (dairy cattle, beef cattle, calf and lamb growing <b>feeds),</b> totalling 78 <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> were analysed to determine their feeding value, dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM) digestibility and energy content (digestible energy (DE), metabolisable energy (ME) and net energy for lactation (NEL). As {{a result of this}} study, the crude fiber (CF) levels were higher than standard values in calf and lamb <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> and beef cattle compound feeds; however, in the dairy cattle and calf and lamb <b>compound</b> <b>feeds,</b> the crude protein (CP) values were lower than standard values. These findings are considered highly important for the region’s animal feeding.

40|$|<b>Compounded</b> <b>feeds</b> {{have been}} one of the {{essential}} requisites in the development of aquaculture. Rearing of larvae in the hatchery, postal larval rearing in the nursery until they become stockable size and their subsequent culture in grow-out ponds require appropriate and nutritionally balanced <b>compounded</b> <b>feeds.</b> <b>Compounded</b> <b>feeds</b> have many advantages. By understanding the nutritional requirements of the candidate species of culture, nutritionally well balanced feeds could be formulated using low-cost feedstuffs available in the concerned region. These feeds could be prepared in large quantities with good shelf life and can be used off the shelf wherever and whenever required. Preparation of <b>compounded</b> <b>feed</b> does not require extensive area and highly skilled man power. High efficiency of the feed could be achieved by judicious manipulation of feed ingredients and can be made economically feasible.

40|$|BackgroundIn the {{nutrition}} literature, {{there are several}} reports {{on the use of}} artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple linear regression (MLR) approaches for predicting feed composition and nutritive value, while the use of support vector machines (SVM) method as a new alternative approach to MLR and ANN models is still not fully investigated. MethodsThe MLR, ANN, and SVM models were developed to predict metabolizable energy (ME) content of <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> for pigs based on the German energy evaluation system from analyzed contents of crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), crude fiber (CF), and starch. A total of 290 datasets from standardized digestibility studies with <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> was provided from several institutions and published papers, and ME was calculated thereon. Accuracy and precision of developed models were evaluated, given their produced prediction values. ResultsThe results revealed that the developed ANN [R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 95; root mean square error (RMSE) [*]=[*] 0. 19 [*]MJ/kg of dry matter] and SVM (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 95; RMSE[*]=[*] 0. 21 [*]MJ/kg of dry matter) models produced better prediction values in estimating ME in <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> than those produced by conventional MLR (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 89; RMSE[*]=[*] 0. 27 [*]MJ/kg of dry matter). ConclusionThe developed ANN and SVM models produced better prediction values in estimating ME in <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> than those produced by conventional MLR; however, there were not obvious differences between performance of ANN and SVM models. Thus, SVM model may also be considered as a promising tool for modeling the relationship between chemical composition and ME of <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> for pigs. To provide the readers and nutritionist with the easy and rapid tool, an Excel® calculator, namely, SVM_ME_pig, was created to predict the metabolizable energy values in <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> for pigs using developed support vector machine model...|$|R

Four diets {{made up of}} 6 kg DM/day forage (Italian ryegrass (R), meadow hay (M), mixture of corn silage (C) and R or alfalfa (A) and R) and 3 kg DM/d of a <b>compound</b> <b>feed,</b> were offered in equal portions at 8. 00 and 16. 00 h to four dry, non-pregnant Friesian cows. Diets and cows were arranged in a 4 × 4 Latin Square design having experimental periods of 21 days. In each period, starting from the afternoon meal of day 11, the <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> was gradually substituted in three 1 kg increments with the same <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> supplemented with anionic salts. Interactions between type of forage and concentrate were significant for urinary pH values. Urine pH decreased at an increasing rate after anionic feed supplementation at different rates for the different of basal forage diets, with the lowest value for R and the highest for A diet. The 1 and 2 kg levels of substitutions elevated urinary C 1 and urea concentrations, but not Na and K concentrations or urine volume: thus the osmolality increased from 266 to 334 mOsm/kg. The highest level of anionic feed supplementation (3 kg) sharply changed urine output patterns with increased urine volumes from 3. 14 to 4. 63 1 / 6 h and lowered urinary Cl and urea concentrations resulting in reduced urine osmolality from 334 to 277 mOsm/kg. The anionic <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> caused a marked increase of the Ca concentration in urine, from 0. 96 to 4. 30 mmol/l, while P levels were not affected. Overall the anionic supplementation caused a progressive increase in urinary output of Cl and Ca (577 - 1085 and 2. 50 - 15. 53 mmol/ 6 h, respectively), while only {{the highest level of}} anionic <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> resulted in significant increases in urea, Na and K outputs.
