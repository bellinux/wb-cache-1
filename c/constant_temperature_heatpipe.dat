40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of <b>constant</b> <b>temperatures</b> (12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 degrees C) and diel {{fluctuating}} temperatures (15 +/- 2, 18 +/- 2 and 21 +/- 2 C) on growth, proximate body composition and oxygen consumption of juvenile sea cucumbers (oxygen consumption was not measured at 12 and 24 C). Growth of juveniles varied at different <b>constant</b> <b>temperatures</b> (P < 0. 05) and the maximum specific growth rate (SGR) was 1. 48 % day(- 1) at 16 - 18 degrees C. SGR was significantly decreased at 24 C {{in comparison with the}} other four <b>constant</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Compared to the corresponding <b>constant</b> <b>temperatures,</b> growth rate increased at the fluctuating temperatures with mean <b>temperature</b> below the <b>constant</b> <b>temperature</b> optimum for growth (18 C) and decreased at the fluctuating temperatures with mean temperature above 18 C. Body crude lipid content increased with the increase in final body weight, both at the <b>constant</b> <b>temperatures</b> and fluctuating temperatures. Crude lipid contents under the fluctuating temperatures were lower than those under the corresponding <b>constant</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Under fluctuating temperatures, oxygen consumption rates increased, but not significantly, compared to those in the corresponding <b>constant</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The fluctuating temperature mode, derived from this research, could be applied to the large-scale culture of sea cucumber.

40|$|A set {{of closed}} form {{equations}} for the preliminary evaluation {{and design of}} a heatpipe -cooled leading edge is presented. The set of equations can provide a leading-edge designer with a quick evaluation of the feasibility of using heat-pipe cooling. The heat pipes can be embedded in a metallic or composite structure. The maximum heat flux, total integrated heat load, and thermal properties of the structure and heat-pipe container are required input. The heat-pipe operating temperature, maximum surface <b>temperature,</b> <b>heatpipe</b> length, and heat pipe-spacing can be estimated. Results using the design equations compared well with those from a 3 -D finite element analysis for both a large and small radius leading edge.
