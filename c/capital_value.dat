The study is based on a cross-section of 708 commercial property assets. Incorporating a range of potential confounding factors such as unexpired lease term, vacancy rate and tenant credit risk, we use hedonic regression procedures to estimate the effect of EPC rating on rental and <b>capital</b> <b>values.</b> The study finds no evidence of a significant relationship between environmental and/or energy performance and rental and <b>capital</b> <b>values.</b> A small subset of 24 BREEAM-rated assets is also tested for significant price effects but a statistically significant effect is only confirmed for equivalent yields. Similarly, {{there was no evidence that}} the EPC rating had any effect on Market Rent or Market Value with only minor effects of EPC ratings on equivalent yields.

GIS is a {{technology}} which is {{ideally suited to}} analysis of the market values of properties, since such values are based upon spatial comparisons {{as well as individual}} property attributes. Great Britain now has a new mechanism of local taxation. the council tax, which is based upon the <b>capital</b> <b>values</b> of properties. Central to the implementation of this tax has been the potentially controversial assignment of properties to valuation 'bands'.

Data for Derby suggest that using <b>capital</b> <b>values</b> to determine rates would correct the anomalies in rateable values which at present exist between individual properties in different areas of a town.

He promised: [...] "If I do not make as good yarn, as they do in England, I will have nothing for my services, but will throw the whole of what I have attempted over the bridge." [...] In 1790, he signed a contract with Brown to replicate the British designs. Their deal provided Slater the funds to build the water frames and associated machinery, with a half share in their <b>capital</b> <b>value</b> and the profits derived from them. By December, the shop was operational with ten to twelve workers. By 1791, Slater had some machinery in operation, despite shortages of tools and skilled mechanics.

2500|$|Now {{that more}} {{is known about}} the trends in {{empirical}} measures of profitability, the debate focuses more on the underlying concepts. Simon Mohun states that the rate of profit is [...] "most easily measured as the proportion of net output not returned as wages to the aggregate fixed capital stock" [...] and that it is this rate of profit that is [...] "generally used in empirical work". If the growth of the gross profit component of value-added (P) is statistically compared with the growth of the estimated fixed capital stock plus inventory holdings (C), it is certainly true that almost all measures will show that the ratio P/C does drop over time. The real value of the physical capital stock appears to grow faster in real terms than the real value of the operating surplus associated with that physical stock, in the long run. The same effect persists even when various different depreciation techniques are used. The data trend is analogous to a rising tendency of the capital coefficient, where in the course of time more and more capital is required to obtain each additional increase in output. The profit rate rises again, only after a major crisis or a war which destroys a sufficiently large amount of <b>capital</b> <b>value,</b> raises the rate of surplus value, and clears the way for new production techniques.|$|E
