50|$|Over {{time the}} PRR {{installed}} <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> {{over much of}} its eastern system from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, New York to Washington. This system was then inherited by Conrail and Amtrak and various commuter agencies running on former PRR territory such as SEPTA and New Jersey Transit. Because all trains running in <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> territory had to be equipped with <b>cab</b> <b>signals,</b> most locomotives of the aforementioned roads were equipped with <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> equipment. Due {{to the effect of}} interoperability lock in, the 4-aspect PRR <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> system has become a de facto standard and almost all new <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> installations have been of this type or a compatible type.|$|R
5000|$|Finally, the <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> are {{considered}} a completely independent system that transmits a continuous stream of codes through the rails instead of via wireless transmission. Any fault in the ACSES overlay will not affect the <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> system and moreover a <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> failure will not affect the ACSES system. Without <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> ACSES will continue to enforce positive stops at absolute signals, all permanent and temporary speed restrictions and a positive stop at any signal {{at the entrance to}} <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> without fixed wayside signal territory that is not displaying [...] "Clear to Next Interlocking." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cab</b> <b>signals</b> are {{presented}} to the locomotive {{by means of a}} <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> display unit. The earliest CDUs consisted of miniature signals of the type visible along the track, back lit by light bulbs. These could be found in both color light and position light varieties depending on the railroad's native signaling system. Modern CDUs on passenger trains are often integrated with the speedometer, as <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> now serve a speed control function. On trains equipped with automatic train control functionality failure to properly acknowledge a restrictive <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> change results in a 'penalty brake application', as does failure to observe the <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> speed limit.|$|R
50|$|Speed {{restrictions}} {{required by}} the signal system are provided by the legacy Pulse code <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> system, {{which has been in}} service on various railroads since the 1930s. The <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> codes are fed into the ACSES cab display unit, which then enforces the more restrictive of the two speeds. The on-board ACSES unit is backward compatible and can function where only the <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> is present without the ACSES overlay as well of situations where ACSES is available without <b>cab</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{case of a}} <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> {{failure or}} the need to {{disregard}} them, the <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> may be cut out by the operator with permission from Center Tower.|$|R
50|$|In 1923 US&S {{developed}} the first inductive train control system. (See also pulse code <b>cab</b> <b>signaling.)</b> The company developed coded track circuits, supporting bi-directional <b>cab</b> <b>signalling,</b> in 1934.|$|R
50|$|All <b>cab</b> <b>signalling</b> systems {{must have}} a {{continuous}} in-cab indication to inform the driver of track condition ahead; however, these fall into two main categories. Intermittent <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> are updated at discrete points along the rail line and between these points the display will reflect information from the last update. Continuous <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> receive a continuous flow {{of information about the}} state of the track ahead and can have the cab indication change at any time to reflect any updates. The majority of <b>cab</b> <b>signalling</b> systems, including those that use coded track circuits, are continuous.|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} {{considered}} to equip {{some of the}} newer engines with <b>cab</b> <b>signalling,</b> {{to allow them to}} run on <b>cab</b> <b>signalling</b> only-routes. This was tentatively done on the 11512 «Horgen».|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cab</b> <b>Signaling</b> <b>Signals</b> - Where <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> is {{employed}} without fixed trackside automatic signals, special signal aspects are required at absolute signals. These include {{some sort of}} absolute block [...] "Super Clear" [...] signal that allows passage to the next interlocking with a fixed signal and also the [...] "Cab Speed" [...] signal that informs the engineer to proceed under direction of <b>cab</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pulse code <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> {{is a form}} of <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> {{technology}} {{developed in}} the United States by the Union Switch and Signal corporation for the Pennsylvania Railroad in the 1920s. The 4-aspect system widely adopted by the PRR and its successor railroads has become the dominant railroad <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> system in North America with versions of the technology also being adopted in Europe and rapid transit systems. In its home territory on former PRR successor Conrail owned lines and on railroads operating under the NORAC Rulebook it is known simply as <b>Cab</b> <b>Signaling</b> System or CSS.|$|R
50|$|The Hudson, Harlem and New Haven {{lines and}} the New Canaan branch and all {{passenger}} rolling stock is equipped with <b>cab</b> <b>signalling,</b> which displays the appropriate block signal in the engineer’s cab. All rolling stock is equipped with Automatic Train Control (ATC), which enforces the speed dictated by the <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> by a penalty brake application should the engineer fail to obey it. There are no intermediate wayside signals between interlockings: operation is solely by <b>cab</b> <b>signal.</b> Wayside signals remain at interlockings. These are a special type of signal, a go or a stop signal. They do not convey information about traffic in the blocks ahead - the <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> conveys block information.|$|R
50|$|A <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> (車内信号, shanai shingō) is {{a device}} {{displaying}} a signal in a train cab. The Yamanote Line, Keihin-Tōhoku Line, Shinkansen and some rapid transit lines use <b>cab</b> <b>signalling.</b> For example, on the Yamanote line there are lamps around the speedometer; the lamp {{corresponding to the}} current maximum speed is lit. On the Shinkansen, <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> were introduced because {{it is difficult to}} see track-side signals at high speed.|$|R
50|$|There are 5 <b>cab</b> <b>signals,</b> each {{corresponding}} to a speed. The <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> are displayed to the operator via {{a series of}} 5 lamps above the speedometer, red for Stop, yellow/red for 20 mph, yellow for 30 mph, yellow/green for 40 mph and green for 65 mph. These lamps correspond to the same <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> in use by various northeastern railroads. Even when the Automatic Train Operation System is not in use, the <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> speed control function is still enabled and if an operator goes above the permitted speed, the power is cut and the brakes are applied until the speed is back within the limit.|$|R
5000|$|PATCO {{trains are}} governed by a Pulse code <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> system which transmits signal codes to the trains via the running rails. Wayside signals are located only at {{interlockings}} and consist of two lamps on a single signal head, one lunar white, the other red. There are three typical signal indications, Red for [...] "Stop", Lunar for [...] "proceed under <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> on main route" [...] and flashing lunar for [...] "proceed under <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> on diverging route".|$|R
25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1920s, the PRR {{installed}} Pulse code <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> along certain tracks used by high-speed passenger trains. Information traveled through the rails using track circuits, {{was picked up by}} a sensor on the locomotive, and displayed in the engineer's cab. PRR ultimately installed <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> on its New York-Washington, Philadelphia-Pittsburgh, and Pittsburgh-Indianapolis lines (the latter which was later downgraded by PC and ultimately abandoned by Conrail). PRR also experimented with <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> without wayside signals, an approach later expanded by Conrail (Conemaugh line) and Norfolk Southern Railway (Cleveland line). <b>Cab</b> <b>signals</b> were subsequently adopted by several other U.S. railroads, especially on passenger lines. This technology, advanced for its time, is still used by Amtrak.|$|R
50|$|The variant KLUB-P (КЛУБ-П) is {{restricted}} to <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> without track safety equipment. It is only used in category-II trains (including special cars and shunting movements). The variant KLUB-UP (КЛУБ-УП) is allowed for category-I trains (including passenger transport) where it replaces the <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> of ALSN.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cab</b> <b>signalling</b> in the United States {{was driven}} by a 1922 ruling by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) that {{required}} 49 railways to install some form of automatic train control in one full passenger division by 1925. [...] While several large railways, including the Santa Fe and New York Central, fulfilled the requirement by installing intermittent inductive train stop devices, the PRR saw an opportunity to improve operational efficiency and installed the first continuous <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> systems, eventually settling on pulse code <b>cab</b> <b>signalling</b> technology supplied by Union Switch and Signal.|$|R
50|$|Some {{locomotives}} {{are equipped}} to display <b>cab</b> <b>signals.</b> These can display signal indications through patterns of {{lights in the}} locomotive cab, or in simple systems merely produce an audible sound to warn the driver of a restrictive aspect. Occasionally, <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> are used by themselves, but more commonly {{they are used to}} supplement signals placed at lineside. <b>Cab</b> <b>signalling</b> is particularly useful on high speed railways. In the absence of lineside signals, fixed markers may be provided at those places where signals would otherwise exist, to mark the limit of a movement authority.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the wreck, all {{locomotives}} operating on the Northeast Corridor are now required to have automatic <b>cab</b> <b>signalling</b> with an automatic train stop feature. Although common on passenger trains up until that time, <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> combined with train stop and speed control had never been installed on freight locomotives due to potential train handling issues at high speed. Conrail subsequently developed a device called a locomotive speed limiter (LSL), a computerized device that is designed to monitor and control the rate of deceleration for restrictive signals in conjunction with <b>cab</b> <b>signals.</b> All freight locomotives operated on the Northeast Corridor must now be equipped with an operating LSL which also limits top speed to 50 mph. Previously, freight locomotives were only required to have automatic <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> without an automatic train stop feature.|$|R

3000|$|<b>Cab</b> <b>signaling</b> A more {{significant}} {{difference is the}} extensive use of <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> and enforced signal systems, such as ETMS and ATS in Europe.

50|$|All tramlines run on {{standard}} gauge track {{and use the}} same overhead voltage, 750 V DC. But there are three different <b>cab</b> <b>signalling</b> systems, one for Lidingöbanan, one for Tvärbanan Alvik-Sickla and a third for Tvärbanan Solna-Alvik. This makes rolling stock incompatible. The other tramlines (Nockeby and City/Djurgården) have no <b>cab</b> <b>signalling</b> requirement.|$|R

50|$|While {{train speed}} {{optimization}} needs some technical infrastructure, {{it is more}} of an operational concept than a technical installation. One can relatively easily implement train speed optimization using for instance <b>cab</b> <b>signalling</b> (e.g. using ETCS), but the presence of a <b>cab</b> <b>signalling</b> system {{does not necessarily mean that}} it uses train speed optimization.

50|$|For {{its next}} installation, on the Northern Central line between Baltimore, MD and Harrisburg, PA in 1926 (1927?), the PRR tested another {{variation}} of <b>cab</b> <b>signals</b> which dropped the loop signal and switched to 100 Hz for the track signal. The pivotal change was that now {{it would come}} on above Restricting merely as a carrier and 1.25 to 3 Hz on-off pulsing of it would {{be used as a}} code to convey the aspects. The presence of the carrier alone was not meaningful, no pulsing would still mean a Restricting aspect. This new system allowed four signal aspects: Restricting; Approach; Approach (next signal at) Medium (speed); and Clear. Initially the <b>cab</b> <b>signaling</b> system only acted as a form of automatic train stop where the engineer would have to acknowledge any drop in the <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> to a more restrictive aspect to prevent the brakes from automatically applying. Later, passenger engines were upgraded with speed control which enforced the rulebook speed associated with each <b>cab</b> <b>signal</b> (Clear = No Restriction, Approach Medium = 45 mph, Approach = 30 mph, Restricting = 20 mph).|$|R
50|$|<b>Cab</b> <b>signalling</b> is {{a system}} that {{communicates}} signalling information into the train cab (driving position). The simplest systems 'repeat' the trackside signal aspect, while more sophisticated systems also display the maximum permitted speed and dynamic information for the route ahead, based on the distance in front which is clear and the braking characteristics of the train. In modern systems, a train protection system is usually overlaid on top of the <b>cab</b> <b>signalling</b> system and will automatically apply the brakes and bring the train to a stand if the driver fails to control the speed of the train in accordance with the system demands. <b>Cab</b> <b>signalling</b> systems range from simple coded track circuits, to transponders that communicate with the cab, and communication-based train control systems.|$|R
