500|$|Shoe polish {{is applied}} to the shoe using a rag, cloth, or brush. Shoe polish is not a <b>cleaning</b> <b>product,</b> and {{therefore}} the footwear should be both clean and dry before application. A vigorous rubbing action to apply the polish evenly on the boot, followed by further buffing with a clean dry cloth or brush, usually provides good results. Another technique, known as spit-polishing or bull polishing, involves gently rubbing polish into the leather with a cloth and a drop of water or spit. This achieves the mirror-like, high-gloss finish sometimes known as a spit shine or bull which is especially valued in military organizations. Despite the term, saliva is less commonly used as the vehicle or diluent with polish than is water. [...] Polishes containing carnauba wax {{can be used as a}} protective coating to extend the life and look of a leather shoe.|$|E

40|$|A {{growing number}} of studies have {{identified}} cleaners as a group at risk for adverse health effects of the skin and the respiratory tract. Chemical substances present in <b>cleaning</b> <b>products</b> could be responsible for these effects. Currently, only limited information is available about irritant and health hazardous chemical substances found in <b>cleaning</b> <b>products.</b> We hypothesized that chemical substances present in <b>cleaning</b> <b>products</b> are known health hazardous substances that might be involved in adverse health effects of the skin and the respiratory tract. We performed a systematic review of <b>cleaning</b> <b>products</b> used in the Swiss cleaning sector. We surveyed Swiss professional cleaning companies (n = 1476) to identify the most used products (n = 105) for inclusion. Safety data sheets (SDSs) were reviewed and hazardous substances present in <b>cleaning</b> <b>products</b> were tabulated with current European and global harmonized system hazard labels. Professional <b>cleaning</b> <b>products</b> are mixtures of substances (arithmetic mean 3. 5 +/- 2. 8), and more than 132 different chemical substances were identified in 105 products. The main groups of chemicals were fragrances, glycol ethers, surfactants, solvents; and to a lesser extent, phosphates, salts, detergents, pH-stabilizers, acids, and bases. Up to 75 % of products contained irritant (Xi), 64 % harmful (Xn) and 28 % corrosive (C) labeled substances. Hazards for eyes (59 %) and skin (50 %), and hazards by ingestion (60 %) were the most reported. <b>Cleaning</b> <b>products</b> potentially give rise to simultaneous exposures to different chemical substances. As professional cleaners represent a large workforce, and <b>cleaning</b> <b>products</b> are widely used, it is a major public health issue to better understand these exposures.
