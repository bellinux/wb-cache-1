40|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{classify}} the sediment on their degree of maturity. Compositional maturity is a reflection of intensity of weathering and a function of labile grains, unstable/stable rock fragments and stable quartz arenites. The main aim {{of this study is to}} investigate maturity and area of deposition and attempt to shed light on source area paleo-weathering conditions. Twenty one samples of shales and sandstones units were collected from a depth precisely between 1160 to 11, 480 m at a well in western Niger Delta, grinded, pulverized and sieved with less than 75 μm. About 10 g was packed and sent to Acme analytical Laboratory LTD., Vancouver, Canada. From the results, various plots and indexes inferring maturity and area of deposition were utilized. Using the A-K-F ternary plots of Englund and Jørgensen (1973), the depositional environment is transition zone. The silicate weathering indexes CIA, CIW and PIA values ranges from 45 - 65, on average indicates low to moderate weathering in the source area with extreme weathering of some sand fraction. Various calculated values of the weathering indices: <b>Chemical</b> <b>Index</b> of Alteration (CIA), Plagioclase Index of Alteration (PIA), <b>Chemical</b> <b>Index</b> of Weathering (CIW) and scatter plots of formulated ratios of Al/Na, K/Na, and Rb/K vs <b>chemical</b> <b>index</b> of alteration (CIA) were plotted.

The profiles show diagnostic geochemical signatures that are uniform across the Corumbataí Formation samples in the studied region and can be correlated from mine to mine, i. e. : 1) the constant MgO/K 2 O ratio and the variation of other oxides, which allow the identification of three main groups of samples; 2) similar groups of <b>chemical</b> <b>index</b> of weathering (CIW) and <b>chemical</b> <b>index</b> of alteration (CIA); 3) the immobile character of REE, Th, and Sc. The erosion/denudation processes were apparently the same among the studied profiles, allowing the identification of a similar weathering pattern among the mines, despite its location within the stratigraphic column. Mineralogical and geochemical data here reported suggest a dominant felsic source, but intermediate or mixed sources cannot be discarded.

Three linear regression models are proposed, which respectively relate drug therapeutic similarity, chemical similarity and their combination to {{the relevance of the}} targets {{on the basis of a}} protein-protein interaction network. Typically, the model integrating both drug therapeutic similarity and chemical similarity, drugCIPHER-MS, achieved an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0. 988 in the training set and 0. 935 in the test set.

The <b>chemical</b> <b>index</b> of alteration, the plagioclase index of alteration, and the <b>chemical</b> <b>index</b> of weathering show an increasing trend from parent rock to the paleosol and indicate a moderate trend of weathering.

The enology {{characteristics were}} studied by three yeast strains of pure and mixed cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae QM, ZYFJQ and Hanseniaspora uvarum YQY with Cabernet sauvignon grape,respectively, while the commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae RC 212 was {{made as a}} control, in order to screen excellent yeast strains or the combination of those for the original wine. <b>Chemical</b> <b>indices</b> of the wines by three stiains were analyzed including ethanol, total acidity, volatile acidity and residual reducing sugar. Flavor compounds in wines and in must were extracted by dichloromethane and identified by GC–MS. The {{results showed that the}} <b>chemical</b> <b>indices</b> of the wine from selected strains could satisfy with the demand of Chinese national standard, and the volatiles were mainly the 2 -phenylethanol, which shaped the main characteristics of wine aroma components. yeast strain QM and YQY got the best balance between acetate and alcohols. The best volatiles of wine was obtained from the mixed fermentations than from the pure or from the control ones. ndigenous yeast strains from grape played an important role on the types and amounts of flavor compounds in mixed culture fermentation. The yeasts could have potential applications to the original winemaking...|$|R
