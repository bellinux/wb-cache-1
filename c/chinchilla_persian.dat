50|$|The Burmilla is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} cat which {{originated in the}} United Kingdom in 1981. It is a cross between the <b>Chinchilla</b> <b>Persian</b> and Burmese breeds. Standards were produced in 1984, and the breed gained championship status in the United Kingdom in the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|The Burmilla was {{originally}} created accidentally in the United Kingdom. Two cats, a <b>Chinchilla</b> <b>Persian</b> named Sanquist, and Faberg√© {{which was a}} Brown tortie burmese were both awaiting a partner of their own breed in different rooms. One night the cleaner left the door open. The two cats bred, producing four kittens born in 1981. Thus, a new breed was born.|$|E
5000|$|His {{name means}} [...] "tree peony", but also [...] "wild boar meat", {{perhaps because he}} was the biggest and fattest cat in the story, {{weighing}} 13 kilograms. He really adored his owner Yayoi, got along with her parents-in-law, but at the same time, despised her husband Yukihiko (him and him alone) just as much and bullied him every time he could. He dated Molly even though he was castrated. He was a <b>Chinchilla</b> <b>Persian</b> cat.|$|E
5000|$|A {{modifying factor}} {{has also been}} {{hypothesized}} in shaded silver and <b>chinchilla</b> <b>Persians</b> whose fur turns pale golden in adulthood, due to low levels of phaeomelanin production. These cats resemble shaded or tipped goldens, but are genetically shaded or tipped silvers. This is probably related to the phenomenon known as [...] "tarnishing" [...] in silvers.|$|R
50|$|SPECTRE {{is headed}} by the supervillain Ernst Stavro Blofeld who usually appears {{accompanied}} by a <b>Chinchilla</b> Silver <b>Persian</b> cat in the films, {{but not in the}} books. In both the films and the novels, Emilio Largo is the second in command. It is stated in the novel that if something were to happen to Blofeld, Largo would assume command. Largo appears in the novel Thunderball, the film version and its remake, Never Say Never Again, where he is renamed Maximilian Largo and is said to be Romanian rather than Italian.|$|R
50|$|Pet {{insurance}} {{data from}} Sweden puts the median lifespan of cats from the <b>Persian</b> group (<b>Persians,</b> <b>Chinchilla,</b> Himalayan and Exotic) at just above 12.5 years. 76% {{of this group}} lived to 10 years or more and 52% lived to 12.5 years or more. Veterinary clinic data from England shows an average lifespan of 12-17 years, with a median of 14.1.|$|R
5000|$|Despite this set-back, Jeannie Johnson {{continued}} {{by getting}} the [...] "Sterling" [...] accepted by the International Cat Exhibitors (ICE) for championship status in 1998. The breed had its own registry under the International Sterling Society. However, not many breeders of <b>chinchilla</b> <b>Persian</b> elected to switch over from the existing Persian standard to the new Sterling standard. Mrs Johnson died in 2006 before she could get wider buy-in for the breed. Due to lack of support, this Sterling breed does not exist anymore.|$|E
6000|$|... "There he is! That is my Silvio. He {{stands on}} {{his hind legs}} and rattles the door handle {{when he wants to}} come into a room." [...] She opened the door, {{speaking}} to the cat as though he were a baby: [...] "Did him want his movver? Come then; but he must stay with her!" [...] She lifted the cat, and came back with him in her arms. He was certainly a magnificent animal. A <b>chinchilla</b> grey <b>Persian</b> with long silky hair; a really lordly animal with a haughty bearing despite his gentleness; and with great paws which spread out as he placed them on the ground. Whilst she was fondling him, he suddenly gave a wriggle like an eel and slipped out of her arms. He ran across the room and stood opposite a low table on which stood the mummy of an animal, and began to mew and snarl. Miss Trelawny was after him in an instant and lifted him in her arms, kicking and struggling and wriggling to get away; but not biting or scratching, for evidently he loved his beautiful mistress. He ceased to make a noise the moment he was in her arms; in a whisper she admonished him: ...|$|R
40|$|Feline endometrial adenocarcinomas are {{uncommon}} {{malignant neoplasms}} {{that have been}} poorly characterized to date. In this study, we describe a uterine adenocarcinoma in a Persian cat with feline leukemia virus infection. At the time of presentation, the cat, a female <b>Persian</b> <b>chinchilla,</b> was 2 years old. The cat underwent surgical ovariohystectomy. A cross-section of the uterine wall revealed a thickened uterine horn. The cat tested positive for feline leukemia virus as detected by polymerase chain reaction. Histopathological examination revealed uterine adenocarcinoma that had metastasized to the omentum, resulting in thickening {{and the formation of}} inflammatory lesions. Based on the histopathological findings, this case was diagnosed as a uterine adenocarcinoma with abdominal metastasis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a uterine adenocarcinoma with feline leukemia virus infection...|$|R
50|$|In GCCF (Governing Council of the Cat Fancy), the Burmilla is {{considered}} part of the Asian cat breed. It is accepted in FIFe as the Burmilla. Only the Shaded and Tipped Silver varieties have been recognised in FIFe, CCCA, ACF and CFA as the Burmilla. As of late 2011 the Golden Shaded and Tipped Burmilla is also recognised within FIFe. One governing body in Australia has used the name Australian Tiffanie, however, there is not international acceptance and standardisation for this breed - Tiffany has been used to describe many different breeds having the appearance from Ragdoll to Birman and may contain any of these breeds and more. Many Australian Tiffanies in Australia contain more than three-quarters <b>Persian</b> <b>Chinchilla</b> and retain the appearance and temperament of the Old Fashioned Chinchilla. The name's use is declining in favour due to the lax standards for the breed name, the lack of unique identity and varied genetic makeup.|$|R
