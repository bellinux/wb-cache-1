5|$|The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man was {{primarily}} developed by Universal Creative, {{the research and}} development division of Universal Parks & Resorts. Scott Trowbridge, who now works for Walt Disney Imagineering, was the ride's producer. Thierry Coup, who has since worked on Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey and , was the Director and production designer. Trowbridge and Coup helped develop the initial storyboards for the attraction. They travelled to Massachusetts several times to meet with the animation directors, Jeff Kleiser and Diana Walczak, and their team at Kleiser-Walczak Construction Co. (now Synthespian Studios) who provided all the stereoscopic animation and <b>custom</b> <b>software</b> for squinching. Coup produced the film alongside Patrick Mooney and Mark Rhodes. Trowbridge is given writing credits alongside Ross Osterman and Scott Peterson. Peter Lehman provided the soundtrack with Soundelux.|$|E

25|$|In {{computer}} programming, BASIC is {{a family}} of high-level programming languages. The original BASIC was invented in 1963 by John George Kemeny and Thomas Eugene Kurtz at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire to provide computer access to non-science students. At the time, nearly all use of computers required writing <b>custom</b> <b>software,</b> which was something only scientists and mathematicians tended {{to be able to}} do. The language and its variants became widespread on microcomputers in the late 1970s and 1980s.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s, the Commodore 64 {{was used}} to run {{bulletin}} board systems using software packages such as Bizarre 64, Blue Board, C-Net, Color 64, CMBBS, C-Base, DMBBS, Image BBS, EBBS, and The Deadlock Deluxe BBS Construction Kit, often with sysop-made modifications. These boards sometimes were used to distribute cracked software. As late as December 2013, there were 25 such Bulletin Board Systems in operation, reachable via the Telnet protocol. There were major commercial online services, such as Compunet (UK), CompuServe (US later bought by America Online), The Source (US) and Minitel (France) among many others. These services usually required <b>custom</b> <b>software</b> which was often bundled with a modem and included free online time as they were billed by the minute. Quantum Link (or Q-Link) was a US and Canadian online service for Commodore 64 and 128 personal computers that operated from November 5, 1985, to November 1, 1994. It was operated by Quantum Computer Services of Vienna, Virginia, which in October 1991 {{changed its name to}} America Online, and continued to operate its AOL service for the IBM PC compatible and Apple Macintosh. Q-Link was {{a modified version of the}} PlayNET system, which Control Video Corporation (CVC, later renamed Quantum Computer Services) licensed.|$|E
500|$|The ROM hacking entailed assembly-level {{changes to}} the game code. Young equated the process to {{teaching}} someone another language by slowly altering their DNA bit by bit, through trial and error. Some of the technical changes included proportional fonts, graphics hacks, and <b>custom</b> <b>software.</b> The game was coded {{in such a way}} that there was not enough system memory available to display the requisite onscreen text. Since Japanese characters all occupy the same amount of space (monospaced), the team had to custom-code the new English characters to fit properly. Tomato said that [...] "no text display routine wound up untouched", such that the fixes for variable width fonts were useless until the team manually made room for the characters. Graphics hacks included the new intro screen and images imported from the English EarthBound, so as to preserve continuity of features. For example, an octopus statue pun from Mother 2 was converted to a pencil statue in the EarthBound English localization and was changed accordingly in the Mother 3 localization. The team also built <b>custom</b> <b>software</b> to aid in the translation, such as a cross-assembler and tools for handling the script and patching. Members of the hacking team included Tomato, Jeffman, byuu, and sblur, among others.|$|E
500|$|Molyneux {{said that}} might have been [...] "insanely ambitious" [...] with regard to the {{standards}} they set themselves for the graphics, because the system requirements were high and much of the <b>custom</b> <b>software</b> needed to be written. One such program was a terrain-editing tool named Leadhead. He stated that they went from [...] "bizarre ideas", to [...] "the best game I have ever seen". The villagers' artificial intelligence had to be restricted by giving some control to the Village Centre as there was no limit on the number of villagers. Molyneux said of the creature's artificial intelligence, [...] "part of the game itself learns from everything you do and tailors itself to you", and described the creature as [...] "an astonishing piece of work". He also commented that the last months of development were [...] "the hardest any of us has ever had to work", and that [...] "without the right team, this game never would have happened." [...] The models for the trees, bushes, and other landscape features were created in 3D Studio Max, and initial graphics development was done in 2D using Adobe Photoshop. Later development was done using other <b>custom</b> <b>software.</b> Clan multiplayer, where multiple players play as one god, was developed in a rush; its interface had to be developed in two weeks. Black & Whites online community was handled by two servers in London, where the clan creatures were stored to minimise the possibility of cheating.|$|E

500|$|B√©dard wrote Fez in Microsoft Visual C# Express and XNA Game Studio Express. He coded {{the level}} editor {{and the game}} engine, Trixel, which {{converts}} 2D tiles ("triles") into four-sided 3D voxels ("trixels"). Fish made 2D pixel art in Photoshop for {{each side of the}} trixel, which B√©dard's <b>custom</b> <b>software</b> compiled into 3D game assets. Fish would then design levels in the level editor by extruding surfaces, a process he found [...] "overwhelming" [...] but akin to playing with Lego blocks. In their workflow, Fish first proposed ideas that B√©dard would implement. The two would then discuss and fine-tune the addition‚Äîthey worked well together.|$|E
500|$|Machinima has {{advantages}} and disadvantages when compared to other styles of filmmaking. Its relative simplicity over traditional frame-based animation limits control and range of expression. Its real-time nature favors speed, cost saving, and flexibility over the higher quality of pre-rendered computer animation. Virtual acting is less expensive, dangerous, and physically restricted than live action. Machinima can be filmed by relying on in-game artificial intelligence (AI) or by controlling characters and cameras through digital puppetry. [...] Scenes can be precisely scripted, and can be manipulated during post-production using video editing techniques. Editing, <b>custom</b> <b>software,</b> and creative cinematography may address technical limitations. Game companies have provided software for and have encouraged machinima, but the widespread use of digital assets from copyrighted games has resulted in complex, unresolved legal issues.|$|E
500|$|On later Android devices, where {{a number}} of factors (including carrier practices, and <b>custom</b> <b>software</b> {{provided}} by device manufacturers that sit atop Android, such as HTC Sense and Samsung TouchWiz) led to fragmentation regarding the availability of newer versions of the OS for certain devices, the development and use of custom ROMs (which are usually based on the [...] "stock" [...] version of Android) have ultimately become an important, yet controversial aspect of the Android ecosystem. In August 2012, a group of users released an unofficial port of a later version of Android, 4.1 [...] "Jelly Bean", for the Dream as a proof of concept. However, the port lacked key functionality, and had severe performance issues due to the phone's relatively weak hardware in comparison to the modern devices that 4.1 was designed for.|$|E

500|$|Fish created pixel art in Photoshop {{for each}} tiled side ("trile") of the 3D trixel that B√©dard's <b>custom</b> <b>software</b> {{compiled}} into 3D game assets, which Fish would extrude as surfaces in Fezzer to build levels. Fish found the level design process [...] "overwhelming", and B√©dard {{has said he}} was relieved {{that it was not}} his job. Fish compared his design process to playing with Lego blocks, and planned the more involved levels in graph paper to first visualize the 2D views before building the levels in the 3D software. The levels and puzzles were not preordained in a design document, and many of the drafts levels scrapped in 2008 resurfaced to be used later in the production process. So as to fit the rotation mechanic, the levels were made tall instead of wide, and {{the first part of the}} game was designed to acclimate the player to 2D controls before introducing the 3D element. As they worked, Fish first proposed ideas that B√©dard would implement. The two would then discuss and fine-tune the addition‚Äîthey worked well together.|$|E
500|$|Machinima creators {{have used}} {{different}} methods to handle limited character expression. The most typical ways that amateur-style machinima gets around limitations of expression include {{taking advantage of}} speech bubbles seen above players' heads when speaking, relying on the visual matching between a character's voice and appearance, and finding methods available within the game itself. Garry's Mod and Source Filmmaker include the ability to manipulate characters and objects in real-time, though the former relies on community addons {{to take advantage of}} certain engine features, and the latter renders scenes using non-real-time effects. In the Halo video game series, helmets completely cover the characters' faces. To prevent confusion, Rooster Teeth's characters move slightly when speaking, a convention shared with anime. Some machinima creators use <b>custom</b> <b>software.</b> For example, Strange Company uses Take Over GL Face Skins to add more facial expressions to their characters filmed in BioWare's 2002 role-playing video game Neverwinter Nights. Similarly, Atussa Simon used a [...] "library of faces" [...] for characters in The Battle of Xerxes. In some cases, some game companies may provide such software; examples include Epic Games' Impersonator for Unreal Tournament 2004 and Valve Corporation's Faceposer for Source games. Another solution is to blend in non-machinima elements, as nGame did by inserting painted characters with more expressive faces into its 1999 film Berlin Assassins. It may be possible to point the camera elsewhere or employ other creative cinematography or acting. For example, Tristan Pope combined creative character and camera positioning with video editing to suggest sexual actions in his controversial film Not Just Another Love Story.|$|E
