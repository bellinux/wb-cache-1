Despite Cabell's declaration to a relative that, [...] "I <b>consider</b> <b>my</b> life dedicated to my mother's ease", Breckinridge continued his studies. John Breckinridge died intestate, complicating {{the settlement of}} his estate and creating financial difficulties for Cabell, who had been receiving support from his father. Desperate, he appealed to Alfred Grayson, his sister Letitia's husband and son of Senator William Grayson, for assistance.|$|E
500|$|Teenage {{and adult}} fans have shown {{interest}} in clothing with {{images from the}} show; Erin Comella, brand manager for My Little Pony, said that these fans are [...] "literally dressed in the brand". Hasbro has been providing its licensed clothing vendors such as Hot Topic with My Little Pony-themed shirts and other apparel for all genders and multiple age groups. In part of the older fanbase, Hasbro has come to <b>consider</b> <b>My</b> Little Pony as a [...] "lifestyle" [...] brand, and , has arranged over 200 licenses across fifteen categories of products. According to Julie Duffy, Hasbro's vice president of global brand publicity, while their primary market is the young demographic, [...] " [...] found ways to strike the right balance by working with licensees to offer [...] adult fans exciting merchandise geared just for them". Though Hasbro has not revealed how much of My Little Pony product sales are bolstered by the brony fandom, Caitlin Dewey of The Washington Post suggests that the continued success of the franchise four years after its introduction is tied in part to bronies' interest in the show and products, and Hasbro's williness to market products towards the adult audience.|$|E

Hitler suddenly turned around, went to a small table from which he took a water glass and furiously smashed it on the floor.

Days later, Ljungberg agreed to terminate his contract only after one year into the four-year deal for a sum of £6 million. Ljungberg stated afterward, [...] "I gave my all at West Ham and enjoyed my time there but the decision is the best for the both of us.

2500|$|During his day of solo {{flying around}} the Moon, Collins never felt lonely. Although {{it has been}} said that [...] "not since Adam has any human known such solitude", Collins felt very much a part of the mission. In his {{autobiography}} he wrote that [...] "this venture has been structured for three men, and I <b>consider</b> <b>my</b> third to be as necessary as either of the other two". During the 48 minutes of each orbit that he was out of radio contact with Earth, the feeling he reported was not loneliness, but rather [...] "awareness, anticipation, satisfaction, confidence, almost exultation".|$|E

2500|$|O'Brien {{insisted on}} {{representing}} himself {{at his trial}} and argued that the Act was unconstitutional. He explained to the jury that he burned the draft card publicly to persuade others to oppose the war, [...] "so that other people would reevaluate their positions with Selective Service, with the armed forces, and reevaluate {{their place in the}} culture of today, to hopefully <b>consider</b> <b>my</b> position". O'Brien was convicted and sentenced to the maximum of six years, as a [...] "youth offender" [...] under the now-repealed Youth Corrections Act, which submitted him to the custody of the Attorney General [...] "for supervision and treatment".|$|E
2500|$|His final film, My Learned Friend in 1943 {{has been}} {{described}} as a masterpiece of black comedy and has been cited as paving the way for the future Ealing comedy films Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949) and The Ladykillers (1955). [...] Due to ailing health, My Learned Friend was Hay's final film. The plot of the film was Hay in the role of an incompetent barrister being haunted by a serial killer and an ex-client (Mervyn Johns) who seeks to kill him. Many <b>consider</b> <b>My</b> Learned Friend to be among Hay's greatest films as well as a masterpiece of black comedy.|$|E
2500|$|O'Brien {{argued that}} the four words ("knowingly destroys, knowingly mutilates") added to the draft card law were unconstitutional, that they were an {{abridgment}} {{of the freedom of}} speech. He {{argued that the}} amendment served no valid purpose because the Selective Service Act already required draft registrants to carry their card on their persons at all times, thus any form of destruction was already a violation. He explained that he burned the draft card publicly as a form of symbolic speech to persuade others to oppose the war, [...] "so that other people would reevaluate their positions with Selective Service, with the armed forces, and reevaluate their place in the culture of today, to hopefully <b>consider</b> <b>my</b> position." [...] On January 24, 1968, the Supreme Court determined that the 1965 amendment was constitutional as enacted and as applied, and that it did not distinguish between public or private destruction or mutilation of the draft card. They determined that there was nothing necessarily expressive in the burning of a draft card. Chief Justice Earl Warren said, [...] "we cannot accept the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled 'speech' whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea." [...] O'Brien's previous sentence of six years was upheld.|$|E
