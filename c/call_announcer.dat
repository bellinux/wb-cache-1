The scoring was not affected and Daisy corrected herself as Mariangel left the stage.|$|R

5000|$|The New York Times has {{described}} John Sterling as [...] "frequently awful and laughable", often miscalling plays or not describing a play accurately - blaming confusion {{on the field}} or other reasons.

The New York Daily News was also critical of Sterling's domineering of the booth, whereas most teams employ a two-man booth where duties are shared, Sterling does 100% of all play-by-play with his partner, Suzyn Waldman limited to ancillary commentary.|$|R

50|$|Following the colt's {{win in the}} Gotham Stakes, owner/breeder David Lanzman sold a 50% {{interest}} in I Want Revenge to IEAH Stables. In his next outing, on the same Aqueduct track, I Want Revenge gave what the track <b>announcer</b> <b>called</b> a remarkable performance in winning the Grade I Wood Memorial Stakes. The colt overcame a miscue at the starting gate that left him four lengths back {{of the field and}} then after he caught up, got trapped between horses. Heading for home, he was severely bumped as he moved between horses but burst through and pulled away to win by 1½ lengths.|$|R
50|$|The main {{commentator}}, also <b>called</b> the play-by-play <b>announcer</b> or commentator in North America, or lap-by-lap commentator in {{the case}} of motorsports coverage, is the primary speaker on the broadcast. They are valued for their articulateness and for their ability to describe each play or event of an often fast-moving sporting event. Because of their skills, some commentators like Al Michaels in the U.S., David Coleman in the UK and Bruce McAvaney in Australia may have careers in which they call several different sports at one time or another. Other main commentators may, however, only call one sport.|$|R

50|$|David's Jets duties took {{precedence}} over his Westwood One duties, requiring a substitute when the Jets would play on Monday night {{or in the}} playoffs. One prime example of this came on Conference Championship weekend in 1999. At the time, CBS would send the Monday night crew to cover the NFC Championship Game, which featured Falcons and the Vikings in Minneapolis. However, the Jets had also advanced to championship weekend and were {{to take on the}} Broncos in Denver later that afternoon. David followed the Jets' broadcast team to Denver while John Rooney, one of the network's secondary <b>announcers,</b> <b>called</b> the NFC title game alongside Matt Millen.|$|R
