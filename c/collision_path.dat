An extension of this approach to the spatio-temporal domain is also considered and we demonstrate its advantage for the detection of aircrafts on a <b>collision</b> <b>path.</b> We evaluated our approach for the detection of both small rotorcraft and larger fixed-wing aircrafts in challenging video sequences.

We also show that our spatio-temporal approach improves the detection accuracy with respect to conventional singleframe approaches. ...|$|E
