50|$|The {{crest of}} St. Macartan's College, {{as seen in}} the front hall of the school, was {{designed}} by the artist Richard J. King, for the centenary celebrations of 1940. It is modelled on the front panels of the <b>circular</b> <b>boss</b> of the Cross of Clogher,the 14th-century treasure, now on loan from the Diocese of Clogher to Monaghan County Museum. The panels contain the interlaced letters DEUS (God), and, underneath, the motto of the College, Fortis et Fidelis.|$|E
50|$|Chuckmucks vary in {{size and}} decoration, with the <b>circular</b> <b>boss</b> in {{the centre of the}} flap, which {{operates}} as a hook to keep the purse closed, sometimes being decorated by a semi-precious stone such as coral or turquoise. Other decorations on the mounts are in silver, brass or iron with geometric patterns, floral designs, Tibetan motifs, or in the animal style. The steel striker is occasionally engraved: with two dragons or Chinese characters. The University of Washington database contains a collection of fire steels including early chuckmucks on plates 45-48 from several countries.|$|E
50|$|The {{valve gear}} {{is used to}} operate the inlet and outlet valves of {{reciprocating}} steam locomotives. It uses a rocking sector whose motion is driven via a link from a crankpin between the coupling and connecting rods. The ends of this link are circular and offset from the pivots. On these <b>circular</b> <b>bosses</b> the sector is oscillated by a second link from the rod to an extension {{to the rear of}} the sector.|$|R

5000|$|Palazzo Pazzi (Palazzo Pazzi-Quaratesi): The main {{seat of the}} family, at canto Pazzi, where Borgo degli Albizi crosses via del Proconsolo, was {{commissioned}} by Jacopo de' Pazzi, and built circa 1462-72 to designs by Giuliano da Maiano. Above its traditionally rusticated ground floor of the yellow-ochre sandstone, it had a then-novel stuccoed first and second floor, with delicate designs in the windows influenced by Brunelleschi. The central court is surrounded on three sides by round-headed arcading, with <b>circular</b> <b>bosses</b> in the spandrels.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>circular</b> <b>boss</b> of {{roughened}} bone on {{the skull}} table {{is one of}} the most unusual features of Aegisuchus. As in most crocodilians, the rough-surfaced region was probably covered in a thick skin that tightly adhered to the skull. Surrounding the boss, the smooth-surfaced region bears several deep parallel channels for blood vessels, suggesting that thicker, more complex skin tissue covered this region. Vascularization is not seen in any other crocodilian, and may have been unique to Aegisuchus. Given that the blood vessel channels run into the braincase, the vascularized tissue may have served a thermoregulatory role by heating blood going to the brain and eyes. The central boss may have been used in mating displays, appearing as an eyespot. Modern crocodilians raise their heads out of the water as a social signal in mating displays; as a close relative of crocodilians, Aegisuchus likely had similar mating rituals.|$|E
50|$|TLV mirrors are circular. At their centers is a <b>circular</b> <b>boss</b> inset on {{a square}} panel. According to Schuyler Camman, {{the design of}} TLV mirrors was cosmologically significant. The V shapes served to give the inner square the {{appearance}} of being placed {{in the middle of}} a cross. This forms an illustration of the Chinese idea of the five directions - North, South, West, East and Center. The central square represents China as the ‘Middle Kingdom.’ The area in between the central square and the circle represented the ‘Four Seas.’ During the Han Dynasty the ‘Four Seas’ represented territories outside China, and did not literally refer to water. The central square within the round mirror likely alludes to the ancient Chinese idea that heaven was round and earth was square. The Ts represented the concept of the ‘Four Gates of the Middle Kingdom,’ an idea present in Chinese literature. They could have also represented the idea of the four inner gates of the Han place of sacrifice, or the gates of the imperial tombs built during the Han period. The Ls possibly symbolized the marshes and swamps beyond the ‘Four Seas,’ at the ends of the earth. The bending of the Ls could possibly have served to create a rotating effect which symbolized the four seasons, which were very closely related to the cardinal directions. The nine nipples in the central square likely represented the ‘nine regions of the earth as discussed by Cammann as having come from the Shiji. The eight nipples outside of the central square were most likely a representations of the Eight Pillars, mountains that held up the canopy of heaven. The area between the inner round border and the outer rim of the mirror was often filled with swirls that represented the clouds in heaven.|$|E

50|$|Along its whole length, the object's {{surface is}} {{subdivided}} and decorated by horizontal bands or ribs and by rows of symbols. In total, there are 154 bands and symbol rows. The symbols are mostly <b>circular</b> <b>bosses</b> enclosed {{by up to}} seven concentric circles, as known from all other specimens. There are three sets of unusual special motifs: small horizontal ovals resembling eyes (row 92, also known from Schifferstadt and Berlin), small eight-spoked wheels (row 120) and miniature cones (rows 127 and 105). The latter are unique to the Ezesldorf-Buch cone and appear to represent {{the shape of a}} gold 'hat'. The tip of the cone is embellished with a ten-point star. The area where the cone joins the cap-like area is embellished with a 30 mm wide band of vertical grooving, as is the case on the Berlin example.|$|R
50|$|The Imperial Dalek {{shares a}} skirt design with the Necros Dalek. In other respects it {{features}} many differences {{when compared with}} previous variants. It has a stepped fender incorporating a recessed bottom section and integrally moulded collars and slats with no shoulder mesh. There are <b>circular</b> <b>bosses</b> around the appendage ball joints, a hexagonal panel on the chest area, a re-modelled eye and eye discs, a mirrored eye lens with a small gold pupil, flush dome lights and a notched, funnel-like appendage instead of a plunger. The dome has a slightly larger diameter with a sharper angle where the bevelled section meets the curved upper part. The neck bin has a mirrored gold finish and is detailed with a fine circular-section gold mesh overlay, replacing the usual diamond section design. The props are painted predominantly light cream with gold hemisphere, slats, arm, 'plunger', gun, eye discs and light covers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} was programmed by David V. Robinson and constructed by Jesse Russell and Daniel Grumbly. The building is rendered primarily {{in both the}} Federal and Greek-Revival styles, but retains elements of the Georgian period that architectural historian Clay Lancaster noted as [...] "Georgian Survival." [...] The exterior of the building is designed primarily in the Federal style which is accomplished by the emphasis that has been placed upon the central bay of the symmetrically aligned building. The building displays no brick belt course that would be characteristic of the previous Georgian style, nor does it utilize the temple form of the later Greek Revival period. The pedimented gable over the central bay is a distinct characteristic of the Georgian period of architecture. The building's carved limestone lintels above its facade windows and door feature <b>circular</b> <b>bosses</b> on both ends which are characteristic of the Greek Revival period. The interior radiates from a central hallway that traverses three floors. The plan is nearly symmetrical on all floors. Robinson, Russell and Grumbly possibly used the pattern books of Asher Benjamin and John Haviland to create a plan and details for the academy building, {{as many of the}} details align in form with the designs featured in Benjamin and Haviland's pattern books.|$|R
50|$|The cross face bears a cross with {{circular}} {{rings in}} its angles, surrounding a <b>circular</b> central <b>boss</b> {{decorated with a}} keywork design. The arms and shaft are decorated {{with a variety of}} complex interlaced knotwork designs. The upper quadrants held a pair of angels, but have suffered some damage, the right-hand figure being almost completely lost. A similar four-winged angel {{can be found on the}} nearby Glamis 2 stone. The lower left-hand quadrant shows a cloaked warrior armed with a small square buckler and spear, and the lower right-hand quadrant depicts a stag and hunting hounds.|$|R
50|$|The brilliantly modeled ducks-head {{handle on}} the Keshcarrigan bowl is an early {{masterpiece}} of the style, comparable to the best continental work of the period such as the bird-finials on the Torrs Chamfrein horns, the stylistic identity of both heads representing ducks, and both having empty slots for studs in the eyes. The Torrs style originated in Britain in the middle or {{second half of the}} third century BC. The Keshcarrigan cup is on stylistic grounds be contemporary with the Torrs pieces, with the “crimped” pattern {{on the rim of the}} Keshcarrigan bowl perhaps comparable with similar techniques used on the <b>circular</b> Wandsworth <b>boss</b> and the terminal circular insignias on the Witham Shield. The bowl seems to have close affinities to pottery bowls of identical profile from Brittany, which have a similar “crimped” pattern on their inner rims. Being lathe-spun the age of the bowl suggests a comparatively late date at variance with the stylistic evidence. The bowl is of importance in showing the Torrs style is recorded in both Britain and Ireland.|$|R
6000|$|The {{northern}} temple {{is quite}} plain: the middle one is simply painted red, and encircled with {{a row of}} black heads, with goggle eyes and numerous teeth, on a white ground; {{it is said to}} have been originally dedicated to the evil spirits of the Lepcha creed. The southern, which contains the library, is the largest and best, and is of an irregular square shape. The inside walls and floors are plastered with clay, and painted with allegorical representations of Boodh, etc. From the vestibule the principal apartment is entered by broad folding-doors, studded with <b>circular</b> copper <b>bosses,</b> and turning on iron hinges. It is lighted by latticed windows, sometimes protected outside by a bamboo screen. Owing to the great thickness of the walls (three to four feet), a very feeble light is admitted. In the principal temple, called [...] "Dugang," [...] six hexagonal wooden columns, narrowed above, with peculiar broad transverse capitals, exquisitely gilded and painted, support the cross-beams of the roof, which are likewise beautifully ornamented. Sometimes a curly-maned gilt lion is placed over a column, and it is always furnished with a black bushy tail: squares, diamonds, dragons, and groups of flowers, vermilion, green, gold, azure, and white, are dispersed with great artistic taste over all the beams; the heavier masses of colour being separated by fine white lines.|$|R
