40|$|Complex <b>common</b> <b>names</b> such as Indian {{elephant}} {{or green}} tea denote {{a certain type}} of entity, viz. kinds. Moreover, those kinds are always subkinds of the kind denoted by their head noun. Establishing such subkinds is essentially the task of classifying modifiers that are a defining trait of endocentrically structured complex <b>common</b> <b>names.</b> Examining complex <b>common</b> <b>names</b> of different lexico-syntactic types(NN compounds, N+N syntagmas, NP/PP syntagmas, A+N syntagmas) and from different languages (particularly English, German and French) it can be shown that complex <b>common</b> <b>names</b> are subject to language- independent formal and semantic constraints. In particular, complex <b>common</b> <b>names</b> qualify as name-like expressions in that they tend to be deficient in terms of formal complexity and semantic compositionality...|$|R
