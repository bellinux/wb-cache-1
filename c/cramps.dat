30|$|Those with <b>cramping</b> or near <b>cramping</b> {{are more}} likely to have a prior history of muscle <b>cramping</b> during an ultramarathon and greater muscle damage during the event than those without <b>cramping.</b> Hydration status, intake rate of sodium in {{supplements}} and serum sodium concentration do not differ between those with and without <b>cramping.</b>|$|R
30|$|The key {{findings}} of this study are that (1) <b>cramping</b> and near <b>cramping</b> were common in this 161 -km ultramarathon; (2) the most commonly involved muscles were the calf, quadriceps, and hamstrings; (3) those with <b>cramping</b> or near <b>cramping</b> {{were more likely to have}} a prior history of muscle <b>cramping</b> during an ultramarathon and greater muscle damage during the race than those without cramping; and (4) hydration status, intake rate of sodium in supplements, and serum sodium concentration did not differ between those with <b>cramping</b> and those without <b>cramping.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{effect on}} sexual desire is varied, with {{increase}} or decrease in some but with no effect in most. Combined oral contraceptives {{reduce the risk of}} ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer and do not change the risk of breast cancer.

5|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect of {{metformin}} is gastrointestinal irritation, including diarrhea, <b>cramps,</b> nausea, vomiting, and increased flatulence; metformin is more {{commonly associated with}} gastrointestinal side effects than most other antidiabetic drugs. The most serious potential side effect of metformin use is lactic acidosis; this complication is very rare, {{and the vast majority}} of these cases seem to be related to comorbid conditions, such as impaired liver or kidney function, rather than to the metformin itself.|$|E
5|$|These {{symptoms}} may {{be severe}} enough to warrant hospitalisation. Treatment is supportive; antispasmodic medicines may lessen colicky abdominal <b>cramps,</b> and activated charcoal may be administered early on to bind residual toxin.

Once gastric contents are emptied, metoclopramide {{may be used in}} cases of recurrent vomiting.|$|E
25|$|Writer's <b>cramp</b> and musician’s <b>cramp</b> is a task-specific dystonia, {{meaning that}} it only occurs when {{performing}} certain tasks.

5|$|With the {{transition}} to hard courts after Wimbledon, Raonic made {{the quarterfinals of the}} Canadian Open, losing to Monfils, before falling to Murray for the fifth time in 2016 in the Cincinnati Masters semifinal. Raonic was the fifth seed at the US Open, but lost in the second round to Ryan Harrison, partly due to debilitating <b>cramps.</b> In September, <b>cramps</b> were cited as the reason for Raonic to miss Canada's Davis Cup tie against Chile. Later that month, Raonic failed to defend his title at the St. Petersburg Open, falling in his opening match to Youzhny. Raonic withdrew from the China Open prior to his semifinal match due to an ankle injury sustained in the quarterfinal. With the result, Raonic qualified for the ATP World Tour Finals for the second time. Raonic suffered another injury, a quadriceps tear, during his quarterfinal match against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the Paris Masters and withdrew before his scheduled semifinal against Murray.|$|E
5|$|Albert {{was seriously}} ill with stomach <b>cramps</b> in August 1859.

As the horses continued to gallop toward a stationary wagon waiting at a railway crossing, Albert jumped for his life from the carriage. One of the horses was killed in the collision, and Albert was badly shaken, though his only physical injuries were cuts and bruises. He told his brother and eldest daughter that he sensed his time had come.|$|E
30|$|Runners {{developing}} muscle <b>cramping</b> {{during the}} ultramarathon were distinguished from those without <b>cramping</b> by more commonly having a prior history of muscle <b>cramping</b> during an ultramarathon and having higher post-race blood CK and BUN concentrations. A prior history of muscle <b>cramping</b> {{has previously been}} found to be a characteristic of those developing <b>cramping</b> during endurance events [5, 6], so this finding is not surprising. However, as far as we are aware, higher blood CK and BUN concentrations among those with <b>cramping</b> are new findings. While numerous factors account for variability in post-race blood CK concentrations, our interpretation of the finding that those with <b>cramping</b> had a higher blood CK relates to an association of muscle injury with relative exercise demand. In other words, we presume that the higher CK concentrations indicate that the group with <b>cramping</b> was placing greater demands on their muscles during the race relative to their current state of training than those without <b>cramping.</b> This provides additional support to the prior observation that those developing muscle <b>cramping</b> are racing at a relatively higher intensity than those without <b>cramping</b> [5, 6, 14] and that <b>cramping</b> in this environment may be due to muscle overload and fatigue rather than a fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance.|$|R
30|$|The {{questionnaire}} {{also asked}} {{whether or not}} the runner had experienced muscle <b>cramping</b> during prior ultramarathons and if they had had muscle <b>cramping</b> during this event, with answer options of yes, no, and “almost, but was able to control any full-blown cramping” (subsequently referred to as “near cramping”). The answer option of near <b>cramping</b> was included because we are aware that runners sometimes sense impending muscle <b>cramping</b> that can be aborted with various interventions, such as altering gait pattern. Those with <b>cramping</b> or near <b>cramping</b> were asked which muscle groups were involved and in which of the four course segments they experienced the <b>cramping.</b>|$|R
30|$|From this work, we {{conclude}} that muscle <b>cramping</b> and near <b>cramping</b> are common in a 161 -km ultramarathon, largely involve the most active muscles, and tend to occur after the early segment of the race. Compared with those not having <b>cramping,</b> those with <b>cramping</b> or near <b>cramping</b> {{are more likely to}} have a prior history of muscle <b>cramping</b> during an ultramarathon, and evidence suggests that they are placing greater demands on their muscles during the race relative to their current state of training. Hydration status, intake rate of sodium in supplements, and serum sodium concentration do not differ between those with and without <b>cramping.</b> Of the two main theories for the pathophysiology of exercise-associated muscle <b>cramping,</b> the present findings support a muscle fatigue basis for muscle <b>cramping</b> during ultra-endurance exercise over the theory based on hyperexcitability of motor neuron axon terminals due to an electrolyte or fluid imbalance.|$|R
5|$|Aspirin is an {{effective}} analgesic for acute pain, but is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen for the alleviation of pain because aspirin {{is more likely to}} cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle <b>cramps,</b> bloating, gastric distension, or acute skin irritation. As with other NSAIDs, combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone. Effervescent formulations of aspirin, such as Alka-Seltzer or Blowfish, relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets, which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines. Topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain.|$|E

The <b>Cramps,</b> whose core members were from Sacramento, California by way of Akron, had debuted at CBGB in November 1976, opening for the Dead Boys. They were soon playing regularly at Max's Kansas City. The Misfits formed in nearby New Jersey. Still developing what would become their signature B movie–inspired style, later dubbed horror punk, they made their first appearance at CBGB in April 1977.|$|E

The Heat would win Game 2, but that would be their only win of the series, as the Spurs would win Games 3, 4, and 5 to win the Championship, their first since 2007 and the fifth and final title of Duncan's career. Kawhi Leonard was named Finals MVP, becoming the third-youngest Finals MVP after Duncan and Magic Johnson.|$|E
30|$|Prior {{studies of}} muscle <b>cramping</b> {{associated}} with endurance activities up to ~ 18  h {{have shown a}} higher likelihood of <b>cramping</b> among those with a prior history of <b>cramping</b> [5, 6] and those racing at a relatively higher intensity [5, 6, 14]. Muscle <b>cramping</b> has not been related to serum sodium concentration [5, 15 – 17]. The {{purpose of this study}} was to learn about muscle <b>cramping</b> during an ultramarathon lasting up to 30  h, including the prevalence, muscle groups involved, distance at which <b>cramping</b> tends to occur, characteristics of those who have muscle <b>cramping,</b> and whether muscle <b>cramping</b> is related to weight change, sodium supplementation, post-race serum sodium, or extent of muscle injury as defined by serum creatine kinase (CK) concentration. It was anticipated that this new information would offer additional insight into the underlying pathophysiology of exercise-associated muscle <b>cramping</b> in this environment. Based on prior findings from endurance events [2 – 6, 8, 15 – 18], we hypothesized that muscle <b>cramping</b> would be common and more likely among those with a prior history of muscle <b>cramping</b> and is unrelated to hydration status, intake rate of sodium in supplements, or post-race serum sodium concentration.|$|R
30|$|The present {{findings}} offer {{some insight into}} the underlying pathophysiology of exercise-associated muscle <b>cramping.</b> Key findings in this regard were that (1) the <b>cramping</b> involved muscle groups under high demand during the activity; (2) <b>cramping</b> appeared most prevalent, though not statistically different, after the early portion of the race; (3) those with <b>cramping</b> had higher blood CK concentrations than those without cramping; and (4) <b>cramping</b> was not related to serum sodium concentration or hydration status. Considering the two main theories for the pathophysiology of exercise-associated muscle <b>cramping,</b> these findings seem most consistent with muscle fatigue as an underlying mechanism for muscle <b>cramping</b> in this environment rather than an electrolyte or fluid balance issue.|$|R

5|$|At Cincinnati, Murray became {{only one}} of two players, {{alongside}} Rafael Nadal, to defeat Roger Federer in 2006, breaking the Swiss star's 55 match winning streak on hard courts. He lost two rounds later to Andy Roddick, but broke into the top 20 for the first time. In the final two Masters events in Madrid and Paris, Murray exited both tournaments at the last-16 stage ending his season, with losses to Novak Djokovic and Dominik Hrbatý. When the tour reached San Jose, California; Murray defeated a top ten player for the first time, Andy Roddick. Murray went on to claim the SAP Open title defeating world No. 11 Lleyton Hewitt. Murray was a finalist at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic. Playing doubles with his brother in Bangkok the pair reached the final. After the French Open, where Murray was injured again, he revealed that his bones hadn't fully grown, causing him to suffer from <b>cramps</b> and back problems.|$|E
30|$|Runners {{developing}} muscle <b>cramping</b> {{during the}} ultramarathon {{did not have}} a statistically different post-race serum sodium compared with those without <b>cramping,</b> but the statistical effect was close to significant (p[*]=[*] 0.055). To further investigate whether a low serum sodium (below the reference range for normal of 135 – 145  mmol/L) might be linked to a higher incidence of <b>cramping,</b> we performed additional analyses. The serum sodium concentration among those with <b>cramping,</b> near <b>cramping,</b> and no <b>cramping</b> during the final segment of the race was compared and found to not be different. We also compared the proportion of runners with serum sodium concentrations below normal among those with <b>cramping</b> or near <b>cramping</b> and those without <b>cramping</b> during the final segment of the race and found no difference between groups. These analyses were performed under the presumption that the serum sodium concentration at the finish would relate best to any symptoms during the final segment of the race. Given the findings from these analyses, we conclude that <b>cramping</b> is not related to serum sodium concentration in this environment, a conclusion that supports prior studies of runners and triathletes [5, 15 – 17].|$|R

5|$|Cucurbitacin is a plant steroid {{present in}} wild Cucurbita {{and in each}} member of the family Cucurbitaceae. Poisonous to mammals, it is found in {{quantities}} sufficient to discourage herbivores. It makes wild Cucurbita and most ornamental gourds, with the exception of an occasional C.fraterna and C.sororia, bitter to taste. Ingesting too much cucurbitacin can cause stomach <b>cramps,</b> diarrhea and even collapse. This bitterness is especially prevalent in wild Cucurbita; in parts of Mexico the flesh of the fruits is rubbed on a woman's breast to wean children. While the process of domestication has largely removed the bitterness from cultivated varieties, there are occasional reports of cucurbitacin causing illness in humans. Cucurbitacin is also used as a lure in insect traps.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test at Trent Bridge, Hassett hit 115 in a rain-affected {{match that}} ended in a draw. Over the next month, he {{struggled}} in the county matches, scoring only 30 runs in total.

In the Second Test at Lord’s, Hassett made 104, top-scoring in Australia’s 346 despite being hindered by a bandaged right arm and <b>cramps.</b> England took a 26-run first innings lead, but Australia replied with 368. Hassett’s bowlers reduced England to 3/12 but they hung on to deny Australia victory. The Third Test was another wet affair. Hassett made 26 as Australia scored 318 and took a 42-run first innings lead, but they then collapsed to be 8/35. Australia was saved from defeat by the rain, which meant that less than 14 hours of play was possible.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{dietary fat}} {{contains}} mostly long-chain triglycerides (LCT). Medium-chain triglycerides are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones {{per unit of}} energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and {{a greater proportion of}} protein and carbohydrate, leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes. The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil. Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal <b>cramps,</b> diarrhoea and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant. The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by insurance companies.|$|E
