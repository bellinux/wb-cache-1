5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the hurricane in coastal Florida, it became apparent that well-constructed buildings with shutters had suffered practically no damage from winds that caused serious structural problems to lesser buildings. Buildings with well-constructed frames, and those made of steel, concrete, brick, or stone were largely immune to the winds, and the use of shutters prevented damage to windows and the interior of the buildings. <b>Coming</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> heels of the 1926 Miami hurricane where a similar pattern had been noticed, one lasting result of the 1928 storm was improved building codes.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} Gaalipata turned Ganesh {{into one of}} the most sought-after actors in Kannada cinema. He was already <b>coming</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of major {{commercial}} successes Mungaru Male (2006), Cheluvina Chittara (2007), and moderate successes Hudugaata (2007) and Krishna (2007). Yogaraj Bhat had delivered his two consecutive films that emerged as massive commercial successes, the other being Mungaru Male. Ganesh was seen in the film wearing a chain around the neck with a razor blade as the pendant. It became a trend among male fans. The film also proved to as a major break for Diganth who would go on to collaborate with Bhat frequently— Manasaare (2009), Pancharangi (2010) and Parapancha (2015). The nickname 'Doodh Peda' (an Indian sweet), by which Ganesh addresses to him as, in the film, came to be attached with his name in the media along with a tag of 'Chocolate Hero'. The film also proved to be a launchpad in the careers of actresses Neethu and Bhavana Rao.|$|E

5|$|As {{foreseen}} by Secretary Laird, {{fallout from}} the incursion was quick in <b>coming</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> campuses of America's universities, as protests erupted against {{what was perceived as}} an expansion of the conflict into yet another country. On 4 May the unrest escalated to violence when Ohio National Guardsmen shot and killed four unarmed students (two of whom were not protesters) during the Kent State shootings. Two days later, at the University at Buffalo, police wounded four more demonstrators. On 15 May city and state police killed two and wounded twelve at Jackson State College (now Jackson State University) in Jackson, Mississippi. Earlier, on 8 May 100,000 protesters had gathered in Washington and another 150,000 in San Francisco on only ten days notice. Nationwide, 30 ROTC buildings went up in flames or were bombed while 26 schools witnessed violent clashes between students and police. National Guard units were mobilized on 21 campuses in 16 states. The student strike spread nationwide, involving more than four million students and 450 universities, colleges and high schools in mostly peaceful protests and walkouts.|$|E
5|$|Heading into Memorial Day Weekend, United {{wrapped up}} May {{with the opening}} match of their two-game West Coast road trip on 29 May at Jeld-Wen Field {{to take on the}} Portland Timbers. The Timbers, who held a 5–3–2 record prior to the match had won every single match at home during MLS play. United {{successfully}} ended that home streak with a 3–2 victory over the Timbers, thanks to goals from Perry Kitchen, his first professional goal in his career, as well as Chris Pontius and Josh Wolff. In the match, Kitchen opened the scoring for United with a 13th-minute half-volley thanks to a redirected header from Dejan Jakovic. While United were able to hold the 1–0 lead well into the second half of play, a chain of contentious decisions from center official Geoff Gamble, but primarily linesmen Eric Proctor. It was only the second MLS match that Gamble officiated, with his first <b>coming</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> previous weekend. In the 67th minute of play, United conceded a penalty kick to the Timbers. United goalkeeper, Bill Hamid initially saved Timbers striker Kenny Cooper's first penalty shot, only for the shot to be retaken. Proctor flagged for a retaking of the kick claiming that Hamid stepping off his line before the kick was taken, an infraction of the rules. The contrasting argument from Hamid, as well as other United players, was that Cooper stutter-stepped before taking the ball, which is illegal in the Laws of the Game. Nevertheless, it was ruled that a second retake would be taken, again by Cooper. Hamid consecutively saved the shot, only for Proctor to again rule that Hamid repeated the same original infraction. The ruling caused Hamid to storm over to Proctor in disdain for his decision, consequently earning Hamid a yellow card for dissent. For the third shot on the mark, Timbers captain Jack Jewsbury took the shot and buried it in the bottom left-hand post, leveling the score at 1–1. The stalemate was tentative, as Diego Chara of the Timbers conceded a penalty in the box when he mistimed a slide tackle on Pontius, leading to a handball. Pontius scored his second penalty of the season, and his second consecutive in league play to give United the 2–1 advantage. A quarter of an hour later, Wolff notched a goal, extending United's lead in the 85th minute. The Timbers' Jorge Perlaza scored a consolation goal in the 88th minute of play, but it would fail to be enough.|$|E

25|$|In 1971, Georg Kretschmar {{proposed}} {{a connection between}} the Christian custom of praying towards the east and a practice of the earliest Christians in Jerusalem of praying towards the Mount of Olives, situated to the east of the city and seen as the locus of key eschatological events and of the Second Coming of Christ. In this view, the localization of the Second <b>Coming</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mount of Olives was abandoned after the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 and the eastward direction of Christian prayer became general. The theory of Christian prayer towards the Mount of Olives has been rejected by Stefan Heid, but is defended by Uwe Michael Lang. On the other hand, Lang says that it was at that time a practice even among many Jews to pray eastward.|$|E
