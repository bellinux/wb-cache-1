25|$|The general {{military}} {{character of}} the <b>country</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of extreme difficulty. Immediately {{at the front of}} the hills the plain is covered with the Great Saul Forest, for an average width of ten or twelve miles; the masses of the mountains are immense, their sides steep, and covered with impenetrable jungle. The trenches in these ridges are generally water-courses, and rather chasms or gulfs than any thing that deserves the name of a valley. The roads are very insecure, and invariably pathways over mountains, or the beds of rivers, the usual means of transport throughout the country being by hill porters. Notwithstanding this general description, spaces comparatively open and hollow, and elevated tracts of tolerably level land, are to be met with, but so completely detached as to contribute but little to facilitate intercourse.|$|E

While on Larry King Live, Tracy recounts the entire plot of the film Teen Wolf (1985). Tracy reveals {{that he was to}} appear in the movie Rush Hour, but was {{replaced}} by Hong Kong actor Jackie Chan. Liz lies to Kenneth that her phone has a recording of her deceased grandmother singing a lullaby, to which later Kenneth makes her sing the song and his realization that she was singing the song [...] "99 Luftballons", a protest song from German singer Nena.|$|E
500|$|Ed Park {{singled out}} the author's prose for praise, proclaiming that [...] "entence for sentence, few authors equal Gibson's {{gift for the}} terse yet poetic description, the quotable simile – people and {{products}} are nailed down with a beautiful precision approximating the platonic ideal of the catalog". Matt Thorne noted that while he found Gibson's tendency towards hyper-specificity initially irritating, [...] "there's hypnotic quality to the relentless cataloguing". The author's prose was also extolled by Clay Evans of the Daily Camera, and by Benjamin Lytal in The New York Sun, who declared that [...] "the real news, in Spook <b>Country,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> much of the flair that Mr. Gibson once brought to descriptions of cyberspace seems to fit perfectly, now, {{on all kinds of}} things." [...] In The Seattle Times, Nisi Shawl gushed that [...] "ven without the high cool quotient of the novel's contents, the pleasure of Gibson's prose would be enough inducement for most of us to immerse ourselves in this book...." [...] Simon Cooper of The Book Show agreed with the commendations of Gibson's prose, but felt the plot and characterization let the book down: ...|$|E

2500|$|The Japanese popular {{reaction}} to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal found expression in demands for the mitigation of the sentences of war criminals and agitation for parole. Shortly after the San Francisco Peace Treaty came into effect in April 1952, a movement demanding the release of B- and C-class war criminals began, emphasizing the [...] "unfairness of the war crimes tribunals" [...] and the [...] "misery and hardship of the families of war criminals". The movement quickly garnered the support of more than ten million Japanese. In {{the face of this}} surge of public opinion, the government commented that [...] "public sentiment in our <b>country</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the war criminals are not criminals. Rather, they gather great sympathy as victims of the war, and the number of people concerned about the war crimes tribunal system itself is steadily increasing." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{international}} {{coordination of}} environmental protection is particularly difficult with regard to developing countries.

5000|$|One of {{the reasons}} drug prices are much higher in the US {{compared}} to other industrialized <b>countries</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. lacks a national healthcare system that directly negotiates with the pharmaceutical industry.

5000|$|Another sign of {{the close}} {{cooperation}} between both <b>countries</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Sir Leonard Hooper, GCHQ director in the late 1960s, wrote to his NSA counterpart regarding the two large dishes.

6000|$|... "If that is so," [...] Nancy objected, [...] "then all {{the other}} {{elements}} of our lives are sadly out of tune with it. Even the most felicitous union of the sexes demands sacrifice, an adjustment of wills, {{and these are the}} very things we balk at; and the trouble with our entire class in this <b>country</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we won't acknowledge any responsibility, there's no sacrifice in our eminence, we have no sense of the whole." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{greatest}} problem concerning {{health care}} technology for developing <b>countries</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they <b>are</b> {{dependent upon the}} industrialized world for technology.

"Well, {{religion}} has produced {{some of our}} finest buildings," [...] said Theodora; [...] "there is no question of that; {{and as long as}} they are adapted to what takes place in them they are admirable. The fault I find in modern churches in this <b>country</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> there is little relation between the ceremonies and the structure.

In Germany, the real destinies {{of the country are}} decided in secret. There are counsellors there, too, earnest and wise counsellors, but no one knows their varying views. All that one learns is the result, spoken through the lips of the Kaiser, spoken once and for all." ...|$|E

6000|$|The only {{probable}} case of mimicry in this <b>country</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the moth, Diaphora mendica, whose female only is white, while the larva is of protective colours, and therefore almost certainly edible.

The white colour of the female Diaphora, although it must be very conspicuous at night, may, therefore, have been acquired in order to resemble the uneatable Spilosoma, and thus gain some protection.[104] ...|$|E
6000|$|Also {{his opinion}} was that 'the best thing {{possible}} {{for this country}} is wholesale emigration,' of course of those whom the Colonies will accept.

60|$|Beaver, in days of yore, was {{the staple}} fur of the country; but, alas! the silk hat has given it its death-blow, {{and the star}} of the beaver has now {{probably}} set for ever--that is to say, with regard to men; probably the animals themselves fancy that their lucky star has just risen. The most profitable fur in the <b>country</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the marten. It somewhat resembles the Russian sable, and generally maintains a steady price. These animals, moreover, are very numerous throughout most part of the Company's territories, particularly in Mackenzie River, whence great numbers are annually sent to England.|$|E
