40|$|Chemotaxis of {{dendritic}} cells (DCs) and monocytes {{is a key}} step in {{the initiation}} of an adequate immune response. Formyl peptide receptor (FPR) and FPR-like receptor (FPRL) 1, two G protein-coupled receptors belonging to the FPR family, play {{an essential role in}} host defense mechanisms against bacterial infection and in the regulation of inflammatory reactions. FPRL 2, the third member of this structural family of chemoattractant receptors, is characterized by its specific expression on monocytes and DCs. Here, we present the isolation from a spleen extract and the functional characterization of F 2 L, a novel <b>chemoattractant</b> <b>peptide</b> acting specifically through FPRL 2. F 2 L is an acetylated amino-terminal peptide derived from the cleavage of the human heme-binding protein, an intracellular tetrapyrolle-binding protein. The peptide binds and activates FPRL 2 in the low nanomolar range, which triggers intracellular calcium release, inhibition of cAMP accumulation, and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 mitogen-activated protein kinases through the G(i) class of heterotrimeric G proteins. When tested on monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs, F 2 L promotes calcium mobilization and chemotaxis. Therefore, F 2 L appears as a new natural <b>chemoattractant</b> <b>peptide</b> for DCs and monocytes, and the first potent and specific agonist of FPRL 2.

Oscillation frequencies increased with increasing concentration of the first stimulus. In contrast, neutrophils pretreated with the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase inhibitor (17 -hydroxy) wortmannin displayed shape oscillations with the first stimulation, and the frequencies were independent of agonist type and dose. We demonstrate that oscillations in filamentous actin, which may be critical for neutrophil motility, can be induced in untreated cells by natural <b>peptide</b> <b>chemoattractants...</b>|$|R
40|$|Increased {{transient}} receptor potential canonical type 3 (TRPC 3) channels {{have been}} observed in patients with essential hypertension. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that increased monocyte migration is associated with increased TRPC 3 expression. Monocyte migration assay was performed in a microchemotaxis chamber using <b>chemoattractants</b> formylated <b>peptide</b> Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a). Proteins were identified by immunoblotting and quantitative in-cell Western assay. The effects of TRP channel-inhibitor 2 –aminoethoxydiphenylborane (2 -APB) and small interfering RNA knockdown of TRPC 3 were investigated. We observed an increased fMLP-induced migration of monocytes from hypertensive patients compared with normotensive control subjects (246614 % vs 151610 %). The TNF-ainduced migration of monocytes in patients with essential hypertension was also significantly increased compared to normotensive control subjects (221620 % vs 138618 %). In the presence of 2 -APB or after siRNA knockdown of TRPC 3 the fMLP-induced monocyte migration was significantly blocked. The fMLP-induced changes of cytosolic calcium were significantly increased in monocytes from hypertensive patients compared to normotensive control subjects. The fMLPinduced monocyte migration was significantly reduced {{in the presence of}} inhibitors of tyrosine kinase and phosphoinositide 3 -kinase. We conclude that increased monocyte migration in patients with essential hypertension is associated wit...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that viral infections may precipitate or worsen attacks of bronchial asthma. Furthermore, in symptomatic atopic subjects, the local accumulation of basophils {{and the production of}} a basophil chemotactic factor have been reported. We have investigated the effect of cell-free supernates from viral stimulated cultures of human mononuclear cells on the in vitro migration of human basophils. Our results show the presence of a factor in these culture supernates that enhances the migration of basophils toward two separate <b>chemoattractants,</b> a <b>peptide</b> from C 5 and a lymphokine. The enhancing activity, while affecting basophil migration, did not change the response of monocytes. The enhancing activity resembled viral-induced interferon when (a) pH 2 stability, (b) heat resistance, (c) trypsin sensitivity, and (d) species-specificity were compared. Finally, the enhancing activity for basophil chemotaxis and the interferon titer were highly correlated in preparations with a 10 (4) -fold difference in interferon specific activity. Our studies show that viral-induced interferon can augment the in vitro chemotactic response of basophils. Because mediators present in basophils may be involved in the pathogenesis of immediate hypersensitivity, the modulation of basophil movement by interferon suggests a possible mechanism for the association between viral infections and atopic disorders...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionRANTES (Regulated upon Activation, Normal T cells Expressed and Secreted) is {{a potent}} <b>chemoattractant</b> <b>peptide</b> that {{has been shown to}} {{play a crucial role in}} inflammation. Aim of workThe aim of this study was to measure serum RANTES {{concentration}} and it clarifies the effect of its functional promoter polymorphisms on the risk and activity of Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients and methodsSerum level of RANTES was measured using ELIZA in 47 patients with RA and 15 healthy controls. They also were genotyped for RANTES- 403 G/A and - 28 C/G using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). ResultsA significant increase in serum RANTES level was observed between the RA groups, especially active patients, and controls with positive correlations with parameters of the disease activity. As regards to RANTES (- 403 G/A) polymorphism, individuals with A allele were at significant positive risk for RA but G allele were at negative risk for RA. It is noteworthy that this polymorphism was also associated with activity of the disease. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in genotype and allele frequencies of the RANTES- 28 C/G polymorphisms when the active RA, inactive RA, and control groups were compared. ConclusionHigh serum RANTES level in patients with RA especially active ones confirmed its role in RA pathogenesis. Its interesting association with parameters of disease activity may enable rheumatologists to define RA patients who are at risk of developing activity within short periods of time. G- 403 A polymorphism is associated with the development and activity of RA in Egyptians. However, further larger scale population studies are necessary to clarify the role of this polymorphism in RA. If this will be proven, therapeutic antagonists to RANTES may lead to the development of effective alternative treatment for RA, particularly in patients carrying the RANTES- 403 A allele...|$|E
40|$|In many broadcast-spawning marine organisms, oocytes release {{chemicals}} that guide conspecific spermatozoa towards them through chemotaxis. In the sea urchin Lytechinus pictus, the <b>chemoattractant</b> <b>peptide</b> speract triggers a train of fluctuations of intracellular Ca(2 +) {{concentration in the}} sperm flagella. Each transient Ca(2 +) elevation leads to a momentary increase in flagellar bending asymmetry, known as a chemotactic turn. Furthermore, chemotaxis requires a precise spatiotemporal coordination between the Ca(2 +) -dependent turns and the form of chemoattractant gradient. Spermatozoa that perform Ca(2 +) -dependent turns while swimming down the chemoattractant gradient, and conversely suppress turning events while swimming up the gradient, successfully approach {{the center of the}} gradient. Previous experiments in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus sea urchin spermatozoa showed that niflumic acid (NFA), an inhibitor of several ion channels, drastically altered the speract-induced Ca(2 +) fluctuations and swimming patterns. In this study, mathematical modeling of the speract-dependent Ca(2 +) signaling pathway suggests that NFA, by potentially affecting hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, Ca(2 +) -regulated Cl(-) channels and/or Ca(2 +) -regulated K(+) channels, may alter the temporal organization of Ca(2 +) fluctuations, and therefore disrupt chemotaxis. We used a novel automated method for analyzing sperm behavior and we identified that NFA does indeed disrupt chemotactic responses of L. pictus spermatozoa, although the temporal coordination between the Ca(2 +) -dependent turns and the form of chemoattractant gradient is unaltered. Instead, NFA disrupts sperm chemotaxis by altering the arc length traveled during each chemotactic turning event. This alteration in the chemotactic turn trajectory disorientates spermatozoa at the termination of the turning event. We conclude that NFA disrupts chemotaxis without affecting how the spermatozoa decode environmental cues.

40|$|TRPM 2 (transient {{receptor}} potential melastatin 2) is a Ca 2 +-permeable cation channel gated by ADPR (ADP-ribose) {{from the}} cytosolic side. To test whether endogenous concentrations of intracellular ADPR are sufficient for TRPM 2 gating in neutrophil granulocytes, we devised an HPLC method to determine ADPR contents in HClO 4 cell extracts. The reversed-phase ion-pair HPLC method with an Mg 2 +-containing isocratic eluent allows baseline resolution of one ADPR peak. Intracellular ADPR concentrations were approx.   5  μM in granulocytes and not significantly altered by stimulation with the <b>chemoattractant</b> <b>peptide</b> fMLP (N-formylmethionyl-leucylphenylalanine). We furthermore determined intracellular concentrations of cADPR (cyclic ADPR) with a cyclase assay involving enzymatic conversion of cADPR into NAD+ and fluorimetric determination of NAD+. Intracellular cADPR concentrations were approx.   0. 2  μM and not altered by fMLP. In patch–clamp experiments, ADPR (0. 1 – 100  μM) was dialysed into granulocytes to analyse {{its effects on}} whole-cell currents characteristic for TRPM 2, {{in the presence of}} a low (< 10  nM) or a high (1  μM) intracellular Ca 2 + concentration. TRPM 2 currents were significantly larger at high than at low [Ca 2 +] (e. g. − 225 ± 27. 1 versus − 7 ± 2. 0 pA/pF at 5  μM ADPR), but no currents at all were observed in the absence of ADPR (ADPR concentration ≤ 0. 3  μM). cADPR (0. 1, 0. 3 and 10  μM) was without effect even in the presence of subthreshold ADPR (0. 1  μM). We conclude that ADPR enables an effective regulation of TRPM 2 by cytosolic Ca 2 +. Thus ADPR and Ca 2 + in concert behave as a messenger system for agonist-induced influx of Ca 2 + through TRPM 2 in granulocytes...|$|E
40|$|When human {{neutrophils}} become desensitized to formyl <b>peptide</b> <b>chemoattractants,</b> the receptors (FPR) {{for these}} peptides are {{converted to a}} high affinity, GTP-insensitive form {{that is associated with}} the Triton X- 1 00 - insoluble membrane skeleton from surface membrane domains.

Todetermine the molecular basis for FPR interaction with the membrane skeleton, neutrophil subcellular fractions were screened for molecules that could bind photoaffinity-radioiodinated FPR solubilized in Triton X- 1 00. These receptors showed a propensity to bind to a 41 - to 43 -kDa proteinband on nitrocelluloseoverlays of SOS-PAGE-separated cytosol and plasma membrane fractions of neutrophils.

40|$|Three {{independent}} experimental approaches {{support the}} hypothesis that rifampin competes for receptors on polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMLs) with small <b>peptide</b> <b>chemoattractants,</b> e. g., N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (FMLP), but not with serum-derived chemoattractants (C 5 a). First, rifampin inhibited chemotaxis induced with FMLP but reversed the immobilization of PMLs that occurred at high FMLP concentrations. Second, rifampin competed with radiolabeled FMLP for binding sites on PMLs and displaced already-bound radiolabeled FMLP. Third, rifampin blocked and reversed the bipolar shape changes induced in PMLs by FMLP. These effects occurred at concentrations attained during rifampin therapy and were not due to rifampin toxicity. In contrast, no effect of rifampin was observed on serum-derived chemoattractants (C 5 a) in any of the three systems. The evidence suggests, therefore, that rifampin is a ligand for FMLP-type receptors on PMLs...|$|R
40|$|Signal {{transduction}} via receptors for N-formylmethionyl <b>peptide</b> <b>chemoattractants</b> (FPR) {{on human}} neutrophils {{is a highly}} regulated process which involves participation of cytoskeletal elements. Evidence exists suggesting that the cytoskeleton and/or the membrane skeleton controls the distributJon of FPR in {{the plane of the}} plasma membrane, thus controlling the accessibility of FPR to different proteins in functionally distinct domains. In desensitized cells, FPR are restricted todomains which are depleted of G proteins but enriched in cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and fodrin. Thus, the G protein signal transduction partners of FPR become inaccessible to the agonist-occupied receptor, preventing cell activation. The mechanism of interaction of FPR with the membrane skeleton is poorly understood but evidence is accumulating that suggests a direct binding of FPR (and other receptors) to cytoskeletal proteins such as actin...|$|R
