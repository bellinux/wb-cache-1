As a result, he enrolled in the recently created four-year joint Juris Doctor/Master of Business Administration program coordinated between Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School. He readily adapted to the business school's pragmatic, data-driven <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>method</b> of teaching. Living in a Belmont, Massachusetts house with Ann and their two children, his social experience differed from most of his classmates'. He was nonideological and did not involve himself in the political issues of the day. He graduated in 1975 cum laude from the law school, in the top third of that class, and was named a Baker Scholar for graduating {{in the top five}} percent of his business school class.|$|E

Williams utilized the <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>method</b> of teaching, using real life examples to facilitate discussion among his students. While serving as a professor at Harvard Business School, Williams received honors and awards for his teaching and served {{on a number of}} corporate boards. Williams was also the author or co-author of hundreds of cases as well as numerous articles and several books, including Basic Business Finance: Text and Cases, which he co-authored with fellow Harvard Business School professors Pearson Hunt and Gordon Donaldson. Basic Business Finance {{is considered one of the}} seminal textbooks in the fields of business and finance and was adopted for use in more than 300 colleges and universities. In 1951, Williams authored the book, Cumulative Voting for Directors, a study of cumulative voting by stockholders to elect corporate directors. Two years later, he co-authored the textbook Case Problems in Finance with Harvard Business School colleague Pearson Hunt. Williams also authored and co-authored cases illustrating financial policies of banks and corporations, including Chase Manhattan Bank, First Pennsylvania Corporation and General Motors.|$|E
30|$|Welch et al. (2011) {{develop a}} {{typology}} of theorizing modes in <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>methods.</b> Based {{on the two}} dimensions “contextualization” and “causal explanation”, they differentiate in their typology between inductive theory-building (Eisenhardt), interpretive sensemaking (Stake), natural experiment (Yin), and contextualised explanation (Ragin/Bhaskar). The typology is used to analyze 199 <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> from three highly ranked journals over a 10 -year period for whether the theorizing modes are exercised {{in the practice of}} publishing <b>case</b> <b>studies.</b> As a result, the authors identify a strong emphasis on the exploratory function of <b>case</b> <b>studies,</b> neglecting the richness of <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>methods</b> to challenge, refine, verify, and test theories (Welch et al. 2011 : 755). In addition, <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>methods</b> are not consistently related to theory contribution: “By scrutinising the linguistic elements of texts, we found that case researchers were not always clear and consistent {{in the way that they}} wrote up their theorising purpose and process” (Welch et al. 2011 : 756).|$|R

40|$|Aim. This {{paper is}} an {{evaluation}} of the use of <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>methods,</b> drawing on three research studies conducted by the authors in end-of-life care and bereavement. Background. <b>Case</b> <b>study</b> <b>methods</b> have their origins in social anthropology and draw on the principles of naturalistic inquiry. They have been used in a number of disciplines, including qualitative sociology, management science, education and organizational psychology for the understanding and evaluation of complex social systems. They are an appropriate research design for examining processes and outcomes in dynamic healthcare organizations, where it is important to obtain multiple perspectives. Method. We explore issues in <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research design, recruitment and data collection drawing on three studies conducted between 2000 and 2005 in six community hospitals, five adult hospice bereavement services and eight childhood bereavement services in the United Kingdom. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected using interviews, focus groups, observations, documentary analysis, standardized measures and questionnaires. Discussion. The process of <b>case</b> <b>study</b> design is described, including building upon a clear rationale for the selection of cases, collection of data, preparation of single case reports, cross-case analysis and interpretation. In a critical discussion of recruitment, we recommend identification of a key contact person at each site to facilitate access and minimize misunderstanding, disruption to clinical services and 'gate-keeping'. Three principal methods of data collection: interviews, observation and documentary data analysis form the foundation of the rich data set necessary to explore cases in their situational contexts. Conclusion. <b>Case</b> <b>study</b> <b>methods</b> may be empowering for participants because they value their experiences and reveal how their work contributes to teamwork within organizations. They can therefore be both affirming and challenging, as they may expose both conflicts and tensions...|$|R
