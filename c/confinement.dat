40|$|English title: Effect {{of scrap}} tire bead {{addition}} on shear behavior of sand English journal title: Journal of PLA University of Science and Technology(Natural Science Edition), 2009; 10 (5) : 483 - 487 To enhance the shear strength {{and reduce the}} unit weight of sandy fill materials, disposed scrap tire bead was added to sand. The tire bead presented relatively high friction and low unit weight, {{which led to the}} formation of reinforced low density mixtures. Direct shear and triaxial compression tests were conducted to observe the effects of scrap tire bead additions and <b>confinements</b> on the shear behaviour of the sand. Stress-strain relations were observed and simulated. It was found that peak shear strength decreased along with increased bead addition, whereas <b>confinements</b> enhanced the peak shear strengths of materials. Peak deviators or peak stress ratios were influenced by bead additions more clearly under high <b>confinements</b> than under low <b>confinements.</b> Poisson’s ratios were associated with the bead additions and the principal stresses. Tire bead additions of 10 - 20 % enhanced sand shear strength under <b>confinements</b> equal to or less than 200 kPa. The stress-strain relationship of the mixtures can be modelled by using Duncan-Chang elastic nonlinear constitutive law. Deng, An, Feng, Jin-rong / 邓安, 冯金荣[URL]...|$|R

Heating systems produce CO and NO 2 due to incomplete combustion which produces concentrations greater than those allowed by Colombian legislation (Decreto 948, 1995), and international countries such as the USA(National Organization for Security and Health NIOSH, 1994) and Brazil (NR- 15, 1978), which represent some of the largest livestock development industries in the world. Among these gases, ammonia is the pollutant most often found in air inside animal <b>confinements</b> which deteriorates the health and productivity of animals and people. Hence, the study of ammonia has attracted the attention of researchers for years in various different countries. The objective of this work was to discover important aspects which {{must be taken into account}} in animal <b>confinements,</b> such as permissible ammonia concentrations.

5|$|A later model {{suggested}} that <b>confinement</b> {{resulted from a}} co-rotational eccentricity resonance (CER). The model {{takes into account the}} finite mass of the Adams ring, which is necessary to move the resonance closer to the ring. A byproduct of this theory is a mass estimate for the Adams ring—about 0.002 of the mass of Galatea. A third theory proposed in 1986 requires an additional moon orbiting inside the ring; the arcs in this case are trapped in its stable Lagrangian points. However Voyager 2s observations placed strict constraints on the size and mass of any undiscovered moons, making such a theory unlikely. Some other more complicated theories hold that a number of moonlets are trapped in co-rotational resonances with Galatea, providing <b>confinement</b> of the arcs and simultaneously serving as sources of the dust.|$|E
