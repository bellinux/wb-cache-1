Research studies which aim to establish the existence of a causal link between possessing <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> and the act of committing child sexual abuse are examined, as is the argument that criminalizing the possession of <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> reduces the market for such material.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{was the first to}} analyze the {{relationship}} among psychological characteristics, personality, and the types of images preferred or collected by self-reported consumers of Internet <b>child</b> <b>pornography.</b> This study had 4 specific aims: (1) to explore the personality differences between self-reported consumers and non-consumers of Internet <b>child</b> <b>pornography,</b> (2) to examine whether the self-reported male and female consumers of Internet <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> exhibit different personality characteristics and traits from the non-consumers, (3) to assess the types of images preferred by the self-reported consumers of Internet <b>child</b> <b>pornography,</b> and (4) {{to determine whether or not}} there was a predictive relationship between the personality characteristics and the types of images preferred by the self-reported <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> consumers. This study was conducted electronically using an Internet-based survey, which targeted respondents from the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. By targeting current permanent residents from these countries, the study ensured the respondents were from countries where the possession, distribution, and production of Internet <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> was illegal. Results suggested the self-reported <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> users in this sample were more trusting (less suspicious) and compliant (less oppositional) whereas the respondents who did not self-report <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> use were more suspicious (less trusting) and oppositional (less compliant). Second, the male consumers of <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> were less likely to make moral decisions based on social values (e. g., societal norms, laws) compared to the female consumers of Internet-child pornography. Third, those individuals who engaged in more Internet <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> behaviors were more social, unconventional, and followed a different moral compass (i. e., do not make decisions based on moral beliefs). Finally, with regard to image content, the results suggested the self-reported <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> users in this sample might prefer different types of <b>child</b> <b>pornography.</b> Overall, Internet-based research designs assessing the relationship between psychology constructs and Internet <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> use was possible, but this type of research was not without limitations. ...|$|R

United States' law enforcement officials were able to boast in the late 1970 s that the traffic in <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> had virtually been eliminated. The advent of the Internet in the 1980 s made vast quantities of <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> instantly available {{in the privacy of}} the viewer's home. Today, <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> largely exists because of the opportunities provided by the Internet. Internet <b>Child</b> <b>Pornography</b> provides a comprehensive overview of the issue by describing the problem of <b>child</b> <b>pornography,</b> examining the impact of the Internet, and presenting a profile of users. With this foundation in place, the authors then address responses to <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> and shed light on the complexities of dealing with criminal activities that are perpetrated largely online-for example, the fact that people behave differently in online environments than they do in other areas of their lives. The book examines prevention efforts designed to reduce access to <b>child</b> <b>pornography,</b> law enforcement responses designed to catch known offenders, and treatment responses designed to reduce reoffending. There is no doubt that <b>child</b> <b>pornography</b> on the Internet is a serious and escalating problem. Some estimates are that up to 20 percent of pornography on the Internet involves depictions of minors, 90 percent of whom appear to be under the age of 12 years.
