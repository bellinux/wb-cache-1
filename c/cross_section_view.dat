50|$|Electrically {{connecting}} the failing pin to a ground pin produced the electric current path {{shown in figure}} 2. This electrical path strongly suggests that the current is somehow flowing through all the ground nets though a conductive path located {{very close to the}} wirebond pads from the top down view of the package. Based on electrical and layout analysis of the package, it can be inferred that current is either flowing through the wirebond pads or that the wirebonds are somehow touching a conductive structure at the specified location. After obtaining similar SSM results on the two units under test, further destructive analysis focused around the small potential short region, and it showed that the failing pin wirebond is touching the bottom of one of the stacked dice at the specific XY position highlighted by SSM analysis.
