40|$|North Atlantic Tracks are trans-Atlantic routes {{across the}} busiest oceanic {{airspace}} in the world. This study analyzes and compares current flight-plan routes to wind-optimal routes for trans-Atlantic flights. The historical flight track data recorded by EUROCONTROL’s Central Flow Management Unit is merged {{with data from}} FAA’s Enhanced Traffic Management System to provide an accurate flight movement database containing the highest available flight path resolution in both systems. The combined database is adopted for airspace simulation integrated with aircraft fuel burn to simulate traffic within the Organized Track System (OTS).

The passenger is advised however, that airline no. 1 operates the flight from say Chicago to Amsterdam, and airline no. 2 operates the continuing flight (on a different airplane, sometimes from another terminal) to Düsseldorf.

40|$|At a {{time when}} the EU {{attempts}} to reduce the negative impact of transport on the environment, meeting demand for long distance travel becomes more and more problematic. To address this problem, the EU and several national governments have opted for a revitalization of European railways and the development of new lines for high-speed trains (HSTs) with the hope that mode substitution "from air to rail" will allow to meet demand for long distance travel at a lower environmental cost. At the same time, the liberalization of air transport has led to a dramatic (quantitative and geographical) development of air services and to their increasing affordability, particularly with the boom of low-cost airlines (LCAs). Yet, the latter are changing the terms of competition and complementarity between HSTs and air services. In this context, the aim of our communication is twofold: 1. On the whole, to check the spectacular dynamic of airline services (number of routes and flights) against the growth and the spatial expansion of European HST services (min. 250 kph). 2. On a selection of <b>city-pairs</b> served by both air and HST services, to show that the volume of air supply often decreases in case of HST competition, but not systematically nor definitively because of the re-cent boom of the LCAs. To achieve this, we will use the results of our PhD on the global dynamic of air services, updating them for the very last years (first objective) thanks to the databases of OAG 1991 - 2010 (describing the scheduled world air supply in an exhaustive and disaggregated way). For the second objective, we will use the OAG datasets, the maps and timetables published by Thomas Cook and additional data from the rail operators. We will thus identify the European <b>city-pairs</b> connected by HSTs fully or mainly moving on HST lines. For these <b>city-pairs,</b> we will analyse the evolution of the volume of air service in terms of number of flights and seats.

50|$|Users access an airline’s {{inventory}} {{through an}} availability display. It contains all offered flights {{for a particular}} <b>city-pair</b> with their available seats in the different booking classes. This display contains flights which are operated by the airline itself as well as code share flights which are operated in co-operation with another airline. If the city pair is not one on which the airline offers service, it may display a connection using its own flights or display the flights of other airlines. The availability of seats of other airlines is updated through standard industry interfaces. Depending {{on the type of}} co-operation, it supports access to the last seat (last seat availability) in real-time. Reservations for individual passengers or groups are stored in a so-called passenger name record (PNR). Among other data, the PNR contains personal information such as name, contact information or special services requests (SSRs) e.g. for a vegetarian meal, as well as the flights (segments) and issued tickets. Some reservation systems also allow to store customer data in profiles to avoid data re-entry each time a new reservation is made for a known passenger. In addition, most systems have interfaces to CRM systems or customer loyalty applications (aka frequent traveller systems). Before a flight departs, the so-called passenger name list (PNL) is handed over to the departure control system that is used to check-in passengers and baggage. Reservation data such as the number of booked passengers and special service requests is also transferred to flight operations systems, crew management and catering systems. Once a flight has departed, the reservation system is updated with a list of the checked-in passengers (e.g. passengers who had a reservation but did not check in (no shows) and passengers who checked in, but did not have a reservation (go shows)). Finally, data needed for revenue accounting and reporting is handed over to administrative systems.|$|E
40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} for estimating {{the size of}} the market for a <b>city-pair</b> route at an airport from both the demand and supply sides of air transportation. The average airport access cost, average passenger delay cost, and average airline operating cost all either increase or decrease with an increase in the market size of a <b>city-pair</b> route at an airport, so the optimum market size can be determined from trade-offs among these costs. A nonlinear mathematical programming problem is formulated to determine the optimal number of passengers, the local service area of a <b>city-pair</b> market and to perform sensitivity analyses. The results show that long-haul services ought to be concentrated in one large airport, while short-haul services might be dispersed among many small airports. Improvements in the technology of the airport access mode or increases in the average income of the cities served can expand the market size and service area, but at a declining expansion rate. In metropolitan areas with high population density, airlines can operate more efficiently and distribute air services among more airports. <b>City-pair</b> markets with stable passenger demand, or markets served by airlines with efficient scheduling technology are shown to exhibit high cost efficiencies. ...|$|E
40|$|High average fares {{in many of}} the <b>city–pair</b> markets {{involving}} the hub airports of major airlines have been a recurrent subject of public concern and policy debate during the past two decades. In recent years, these markets also have served as main entry points for many new, low-fare airlines. However, new entrants have reported highly aggressive responses by hubbing incumbents, prompting the Department of Transportation (DOT) to propose criteria for identifying and taking enforcement action against unfair, exclusionary practices. Trends in fares and competition at hub airports, the competitive concerns expressed by new entrants, and DOT’s enforcement proposal are considered in this chapter. COMPETITION IN <b>CITY-PAIR</b> MARKETS GENERALLY Airlines compete for passengers at the <b>city-pair</b> level. There are thousands of combinations of origin and destination (O&D) points that constitute the markets for air transportation; in these markets, rivalry and entry activity are most important. In some, such as Los Angeles–San Francisco, thousands of passengers travel each day in both directions. In others, only a handful fly each year.

40|$|Using {{evidence}} from an original dataset {{of more than}} 12 million fares, this study sheds light on two issues relating to the pricing behaviour of the main European airlines: 1) {{the extent to which}} an airline’s dominant position at the origin airport, at the route and the <b>city-pair</b> level affects the airlines’ market power; 2) whether fares follow a monotonic time path consistent with the pursuing of an inter-temporal price discrimination strategy. Our estimates reveal that enjoying a dominant position within a route is conducive to higher fares, possibly because of the limited size of many “natural monopoly” routes that facilitate the incumbent’s engagement in a limit pricing strategy. On the contrary, a larger share within a <b>city-pair</b> does not seem to facilitate the exercise of market power, thereby suggesting the existence of a large degree of substitutability between the routes in a <b>city-pair.</b> on-line pricing; price discrimination; dispersion; yield management. ...|$|E

40|$|The Quebec City - Windsor {{corridor}} is {{the busiest}} {{and most important}} trade and transportation corridor in Canada. The transportation sector is the second largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emission category in the country. Governments around the world, including Canada, are considering increased mode share by rail {{as a way to}} reduce transportation emissions. To understand whether freight mode shift is a realistic means to reduce transportation emissions, an analytical model is needed that can predict the effect of government policy on mode split. This thesis provides background on the freight transportation-GHG nexus in Canada and describes the development, implementation, reasoning behind, and results of, a Stated Preference shipper carrier choice survey for the Quebec City - Windsor corridor conducted during the fall of 2005. It then describes how the resulting carrier choice models are used to estimate the potential to displace truck traffic to rail (premium-intermodal) under current conditions, as well as to test the effectiveness of different possible future policy or service offering scenarios. The results show that premium-intermodal has the potential to capture a substantial share of traffic between the main destinations in the Quebec City - Windsor Corridor. However, its ability to contribute significantly to reducing CO 2 emissions is limited. According to the analyses conducted, potential reductions are considered to be in the range of nil to 0. 413 Mt [...] -a fraction of what the federal government was hoping to be able to achieve through "further public-private collaboration to promote the use of intermodal freight opportunities and to increase the use of low-emission vehicles and modes" (Government of Canada 2002).
