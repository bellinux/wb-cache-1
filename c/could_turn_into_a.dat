5|$|The {{game was}} {{considered}} for development by WayForward Technologies {{as far back}} as 1997. An archived version of the company's official website showcases a very different approach to the game, which was at the time considered for development on PC or PlayStation, in full 3D with traditionally animated characters moving before a 3D background. Shantae was presented as a troubled genie born without magic powers, who had to save the world from the Jins, powerful beings once sealed who escaped {{at the beginning of the}} game and planned to drain all magic from the world. Back then, her magic was capable, as envisioned by Erin Bozon, the original creator of the character, to summon animals, but transformation was already planned as Shantae <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> harpy. Her dances could also launch attacks and she had different outfits with different characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea about}} the men with the inborn ability to leave their bodies in a spirit form, has also been {{recorded}} in Slovene and Croat traditions. The spirit <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bull, dog, bore, or some other animal. He intercepted bringers of bad weather, and fought with them to save the crops of his village. The men with this ability were designated by various names, such as vedomec in Tolmin, mogut in Turopolje, vremenjak in Lika and Sinj, legromant or nagromant in southern Dalmatia and the area around Dubrovnik, višćun in Dalmatia, and štrigun in Istria. A vedomec fought against another vedomec, a mogut against another mogut, and so on, and the winner would take bad weather to the region of his defeated foe. All these men were marked by some peculiarity connected with their birth. There were also supernatural beings, such as obilnjaks and brgants in Slovenia, and kombals in Međimurje, who clashed with each other during thunderstorms over the plenty of their territories.|$|E
5|$|Scholar-officials and gentry also {{distinguished}} {{themselves through}} their intellectual pursuits. While {{some such as}} Shen Kuo (1031–1095) and Su Song (1020–1101) dabbled in every known field of science, study, and statecraft, Song elites were generally most interested in the leisurely pursuits of composing and reciting poetry, art collecting and antiquarianism. Yet even this pursuit <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> scholarly one. It was the official, historian, poet, and essayist Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) who compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze which pioneered ideas in early epigraphy and archeology. Shen Kuo even took an interdisciplinary approach to archeological study, in order to aid his work in astronomy, mathematics, and recording ancient musical measures. The scholar-official and historian Zeng Gong (1019–1083) reclaimed last chapters of the ancient Zhan Guo Ce, proofreading and editing the version that would become the accepted modern version. The ideal official and gentry scholars were also expected to employ these intellectual pursuits {{for the good of}} the community, such as writing local histories or gazetteers. In the case of Shen Kuo and Su Song, their pursuits in academic fields such as classifying pharmaceuticals and improving calendrical science through court work in astronomy fit this ideal.|$|E

25|$|The 16th century Swedish writer Olaus Magnus {{says that}} the Livonian werewolves were {{initiated}} by draining a cup of specially prepared beer and repeating a set formula. Ralston in his Songs of the Russian People gives the form of incantation still familiar in Russia. In Italy, France and Germany, {{it was said that}} a man or woman <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> werewolf if he or she, on a certain Wednesday or Friday, slept outside on a summer night with the full moon shining directly on his or her face.|$|E

500|$|On July 30, 2011, Davis {{was traded}} with pitcher Tommy Hunter to the Baltimore Orioles for {{reliever}} Koji Uehara. Davis became expendable because the Rangers felt Moreland {{was a better}} option at first base; Rangers' general manager Jon Daniels said {{the day of the}} trade that he knew there was a possibility Davis <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> high-impact offensive player and [...] "If he does, we'll live with it." [...] Opinions differ as to Davis's inability to hold a consistent starting role with the Rangers; while one popular theory is that it was because of his many strikeouts and low batting average, Orioles' manager Buck Showalter believes it was due to the presence of Moreland and Adrián Beltré in Texas. Davis said, [...] "I'm glad to get the opportunity to come here", citing his desire to play every day.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} half of the war, {{political}} opposition within the Royalist senior leadership against Rupert continued to grow. Rupert's personality during the war had made him both friends and enemies. He enjoyed a [...] "frank and generous disposition", showed a [...] "quickness of... intellect", was prepared to face grave dangers, and could be thorough and patient when necessary. However, he lacked the social gifts of a courtier, and his humour <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> [...] "sardonic wit and a contemptuous manner": with a hasty temper, he was too quick to say who he respected, and who he disliked. The result was that, while Rupert could inspire great loyalty in some, especially his men, he also made many enemies at the Royal court. When he took Bristol, he also slighted the Marquess of Hertford, the lethargic but politically significant Royalist leader of the South-West. Most critically, Rupert fell out with George Digby, a favourite of both the King and the Queen. Digby was a classic courtier and Rupert fell to arguing with him repeatedly in meetings. The result was that towards the end of the war Rupert's position at court was increasingly undermined by his enemies.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was highly}} rated by most reviewers, though the combat system had detractors. Dillard of Nintendo Life {{felt that the}} gameplay {{was as good as}} that of Secret of Mana and it had [...] "a much more strategic feel to it". The 1UP.com and Cubed3 reviews also brought up the day and time system as interesting additions, though the 1UP.com reviewer felt that the combat was not [...] "quite as tight" [...] as in Secret of Mana. The Next Generation preview, while acknowledging that several flaws in the Secret of Mana combat system had been corrected and praising the boss battles, felt that the computer-controlled characters showed no sense of tactics, resulting in a free-for-all. A review by JeuxVideo.com also noted several improvements in the combat system over the prior game, but felt that battles <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> chaotic mass of attacks and numbers. Parsons of RPGamer also called out the Ring system as being flawed, as he found it frustrating that the menu could not be brought up while a character was performing an action, making boss battles hectic and difficult. The JeuxVideo.com reviewer also took issue with this restriction.|$|E

500|$|Old Slavic mythology knew of men {{who were}} born out of {{relationships}} between women and dragons. These men were endowed with prodigious strength and exceptional abilities. They <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> dragon and fly, which they usually did in crisis situations, like battles. Two such heroes are recorded in the Serbian epic poetry: Sekula Banović and Zmaj Ognjeni Vuk ("Fiery Dragon" [...] Vuk). Both were late-medieval nobles and warriors, to whom mythical attributes were attached in the poetry. Their transformation into a dragon is described in three ways: the hero dresses his [...] "dragon shirt"; he spreads his hidden wings; or he lets his soul out from his body {{in the form of}} a winged snake. The transformation may not be explicitly stated, but implied by a statement which indicates that the hero flies. Russian epic hero Volkh Vseslavevich is described as a son of a dragon; in folk poems, he transforms into a falkon, aurochs, wolf, and some other animals. In a couple of Serbian and Bulgarian folk poems, Saint Nicholas suddenly falls asleep, and while he sleeps, he saves ships from a storm.|$|E
500|$|Audioslave's history {{dates back}} to October 18, 2000, when Rage Against the Machine's lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha {{announced}} he was leaving the band, citing a breakdown in its [...] "decision-making process". Rage Against the Machine broke up {{as a result of}} de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed [...] "it <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario." [...] Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him [...] "the angel at the crossroads" [...] because [...] "if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today." ...|$|E
500|$|Nathin Rabin of The A.V. Club, {{who gave}} the episode a B+ grade, said it was [...] "long on pathos and awkwardness but short on laughs", but {{described}} it as [...] "a very satisfying way to end a very satisfying season". Although Rabin said the final scene with Jim and Pam was filmed and handled artfully, he also {{expressed concern that the}} subplot <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> cliched device, and said [...] "part of me felt it was a rather pat, heavy-handed way of ending the season on a dramatic note." [...] Will Leitch of New York magazine expressed concern about the dangers of television shows adding a pregnancy subplot, but said of the episode, [...] "For now, we’ll bask in the happiness of two main characters who have waited a long time for it." [...] Leitch, who called Holly the show's [...] "most beloved guest star", also complimented the way the episode handled Michael and Holly's brief reunion: [...] "The couple and the producers seem to have come to the same conclusion about this relationship: Holly (Amy Ryan) can’t actually stay with Michael (Steve Carell), so let’s just enjoy her while she’s here." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN complimented the episode but said it [...] "doesn't really reach that high", which he said was disappointing following a string of eventful episodes. He praised the Holly character and the way Jim and Dwight worked so well together during the volleyball game, and although he said the final scene was a nice moment between Jim and Pam, he also said the twist was [...] "predictable and telegraphed".|$|E

2500|$|Originally {{the game}} was to be more open world based, with the {{possibility}} that each NPC <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Thing at any moment completely randomized. Curtis also hoped the player {{could get to the}} end of the game with many, perhaps all, of the NPCs still alive. However, this kind of open-endedness proved impossible to implement, with Curtis, pointing out [...] "it was of course very naïve as it caused huge problems with the squad command menu and dynamically balancing the encounters and resources required for the NPC." [...] Ultimately, NPC characters were scripted to change into Things at specific points, irrespective of the player's actions. This led to a much criticized aspect of the game; the player can test an NPC to find he is human only for him to change into a Thing mere second later. Programmer Diarmid Campbell explains ...|$|E

[...] He moved to [...] Sudan in 2007, where he vocally denounced abuses by increasingly fragmented armed groups as well as access constraints caused by the Sudanese Government, and called for more funding also in response to floods that hit the city of Kassala. In 2008 he was posted to Chad, calling for more international attention amidst conflict between Chadian and pro-Sudanese forces which displaced {{more than half a million}} people, and with the events culminating in the battle of N'Djamena of February 2008, after which he worked in Cameroon following the refugee crisis caused by war and asking for solid international support for the refugees and for reconstruction efforts, warning that a humanitarian crisis <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> humanitarian catastrophe in the absence of a robust response.|$|E
2500|$|In his [...] "curious little autobiography" [...] called The Wonders of Free Grace, as Manifested in the Life of James Weller, Minister of the Gospel, Bethel Chapel, Robertsbridge (1844), Weller {{described}} his concerns at {{the running of}} the Burwash chapel, and in 1842 he had the opportunity to establish his own chapel when a friend, James Caffyn, offered him a house on the High Street in Robertsbridge which he <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> place of worship. [...] This included a lease for 50 years and an annual maintenance fund of £10. [...] The first stone of the chapel, [...] "half hidden behind a shop and a cottage", was laid on 1 November 1842. [...] Weller officially left the chapel at Burwash in January 1843, and Bethel Strict Baptist Chapel opened on 17 January 1843. [...] Weller noted that he preached to a very large congregation, but that he [...] "was sorely tried the whole of the day with [...] own debts and those of the chapel". [...] It was common in Sussex for chapels to be built for the benefit of particular preachers rather than because the local populace demanded one, and in the chapel's early years many members of the congregation were drawn from the chapel at Burwash rather than from Robertsbridge village.|$|E

In response the interim Interior Minister said an arrest warrant would be issued for him while his immunity was removed. On 13 April, Bakiyev said he would resign should his security and that of his family and entourage be guaranteed. He said [...] "In what case would I resign?

Also, I need to know that my own security and the security of members of my family and those close to me will be assured."
