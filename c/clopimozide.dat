50|$|<b>Clopimozide</b> (R-29,764) is {{a typical}} {{antipsychotic}} drug of the diphenylbutylpiperidine class. It is very potent and has an extremely long duration of action, lasting at least one week with a single dose. It was developed by Janssen Pharmaceutica but was never marketed.|$|E
40|$|Antischizophrenic {{neuroleptic}} drugs of the diphenylbutylpiperidine class, {{which includes}} pimozide, fluspirilene, penfluridol, and <b>clopimozide,</b> inhibit [3 H]nitrendipine binding with IC 50 values of 13 - 30 nM. This inhibition involves receptors for the verapamil/prenylamine class of calcium channel antagonists. These diphenylbutylpiperidines also inhibit potassium-induced calcium-dependent contractions of rat vas deferens at concentrations of 40 - 350 nM. Other phenothiazine and butyrophenone neuroleptics lack such potent calcium-antagonist actions. Diphenylbutylpiperidines also differ from other neuroleptics {{in their ability}} to relieve negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as emotional withdrawal, as well as the positive symptoms which respond to all neuroleptics. We suggest that these unique antischizophrenic actions are related to a blockade by diphenylbutylpiperidines of voltage-operated calcium channels...|$|E
