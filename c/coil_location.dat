40|$|SUMMARY: Stimulating brain {{areas with}} {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation (TMS) while concurrently and noninvasively recording brain activity changes through functional MRI enables a new range of investigations about causal interregional interactions in the human brain. However, standard head-coil arrangements for current methods for concurrent TMS-functional MRI somewhat restrict the cortical brain regions that can be targeted with TMS because space in typical MR head coils is limited. Another limitation for concurrent TMS-functional MRI approaches concerns the estimation of the precise stimulation site, which can limit {{the interpretation of the}} activity changes induced by TMS and increase the variability of the stimulation effects. Here, we present a novel approach using flexible MR receiver coils, allowing for stimulation of {{a large part of the}} cortex including more lateral areas. Furthermore, we present a fast and economical method to determine the precise location of the stimulation coil during scanning. This point-based registration method can accurately compute, during scanning, where TMS pulses are delivered. We validated this approach by stimulating medial (M 1) and more lateral (dorsal part of the supramarginal gyrus) brain areas concurrently with functional MRI. Activation close to but not directly at the stimulated location and in distal areas connected to the targeted site was observed. This study provides a proof of concept that TMS of medial and lateral brain areas is feasible without significantly compromising brain coverage and that one can precisely determine the exact <b>coil</b> <b>location</b> inside the bore to verify targeting of brain areas...|$|E

Without careful design, strong resonances during steady state operation can wear these components {{to the point of}} failure, leading to an unsafe situation that may force a plant to shut down. The purpose of this research is to further the understanding of the vibrations induced in a helical coil subject to steady fluid flow. A helical coil steam generator, such as that found in most integral pressurized water reactors, appears to eliminate many flow-induced vibration concerns when compared to traditional steam generators; however this has yet to be clearly demonstrated experimentally. The objective of this work is to develop a method of characterizing the motion of a helical coil in an annulus subject to external axial-flow of water. This is accomplished by observing the motion of a helical coil mounted to an inner opaque cylinder through an outer glass tube using a high speed video camera. A mirrored image-pair is used to observe this structure from two perspectives simultaneously, allowing for three-dimensional characterization of the coil motion. The experimental facility is described in detail. The method developed herein for identifying specific points on the coil from images and mapping them to the <b>coil</b> <b>location</b> using the law of refraction is described.

40|$|Vessel {{selective}} arterial spin labelling (ASL) is {{a magnetic}} resonance imaging technique which permits the visualisation and assessment of the perfusion territory of {{a specific set of}} feeding arteries. It is of clinical importance in both acute and chronic cerebrovascular disease, and the mapping of blood supplied to tumours. Continuous ASL is capable of providing the highest signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio of the various ASL methods. However on clinical systems it suffers from high hardware demands, and the control of systematic errors decreases perfusion sensitivity. A separate labelling coil avoids these problems, enabling high labelling efficiency and subsequent high SNR, and vessel specificity can be localised to one carotid artery. However this relies on the careful and accurate positioning of the labelling coil over the common carotid arteries in the neck. It is proposed to combine parallel transmission (multiple transmit coils, each transmitting with different amplitudes and phases) to spatially tailor the labelling field, removing the reliance on <b>coil</b> <b>location</b> for optimal labelling efficiency, and enabling robust vessel selective labelling {{with a high degree of}} specificity. Presented is the application of parallel transmission methods to continuous ASL, requiring the development of an ASL labelling coil array, and a two channel transmitter system.

A perfusion phantom with distinct vascular territories was constructed for sequence testing and development. Phantom and in-vivo testing of parallel transmit CASL using a 3 D-GRASE acquisition showed an improvement of up to 35 % in vessel specificity when compared with using a single labelling coil, whilst retaining the high labelling efficiency and associated SNR of separate coil CASL methods...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prevalence and {{characteristics}} of ipsilateral upper limb motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were compared in healthy subjects and patients with acute stroke. METHODS: Sixteen healthy subjects and 25 patients with acute stroke underwent focal TMS at maximum stimulator output over motor and premotor cortices. If present, MEPs evoked in muscles ipsilateral to TMS were analyzed for latency, amplitude, shape, and center of gravity (ie, preferential <b>coil</b> <b>location</b> to elicit them). In stroke patients, possible relationships between early ipsilateral responses and functional outcome at 6 months were sought. RESULTS: With relaxed or slightly contracting target muscle, maximal TMS over the motor cortex failed to elicit ipsilateral MEPs in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) or biceps of any of 16 normal subjects. In 5 of 8 healthy subjects tested, ipsilateral MEPs with latencies longer than contralateral MEPs were evoked in FDI muscle (in biceps, 6 of 8 subjects) during strong (> 50 % maximum) contraction of the target muscle. In 15 of 25 stroke patients, ipsilateral MEPs in the unaffected relaxed FDI (in biceps, 6 of 25 stroke patients) were evoked by stimulation of premotor areas of the affected hemisphere. Their latencies were shorter than those that MEPs evoked in the same muscle by stimulation of the motor cortex of the contralateral unaffected hemisphere. Such responses were never obtained in normal subjects and were mostly observed in patients with subcortical infarcts. Patients harboring these responses had slightly better bimanual dexterity after 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Ipsilateral MEPs obtained in healthy individuals and stroke patients have different characteristics and probably different origins. In the former, they are probably conveyed via corticoreticulospinal or corticopropriospinal pathways, whereas in the latter, early ipsilateral MEPs could originate in hyperexcitable premotor areas.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{evidence}} indicates subject-specific gyral folding patterns and white matter anisotropy uniquely shape electric fields generated by TMS. Current methods for predicting the brain regions influenced by TMS involve projecting the TMS coil position or {{center of gravity}} onto realistic head models derived from structural and functional imaging data. Similarly, spherical models {{have been used to}} estimate electric field distributions generated by TMS pulses delivered from a particular <b>coil</b> <b>location</b> and position. In the present paper we inspect differences between electric field computations estimated using the finite element method (FEM) and projection-based approaches described above. We then more specifically examined an approach for estimating cortical excitation volumes based on individualistic FEM simulations of electric fields. We evaluated this approach by performing neurophysiological recordings during MR-navigated motormapping experiments. We recorded motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in response to single pulse TMS using two different coil orientations (45 ° and 90 ° to midline) at 25 different locations (5 × 5 grid, 1 cm spacing) centered on the hotspot of the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle in left motor cortex. We observed that motor excitability maps varied within and between subjects as a function of TMS coil position and orientation. For each coil position and orientation tested, simulations of the TMS-induced electric field were computed using individualistic FEM models and compared to MEP amplitudes obtained during our motormapping experiments. We found FEM simulations of electric field strength, which take into account subject-specific gyral geometry and tissue conductivity anisotropy, significantly correlated with physiologically observed MEP amplitudes (rmax= 0. 91, p= 1. 8 × 10 - 5 rmean= 0. 81, p= 0. 01). These observations validate the implementation of individualistic FEM models to account for variations in gyral folding patterns and tissue conductivity anisotropy, which should help improve the targeting accuracy of TMS in the mapping or modulation of human brain circuits...|$|E
40|$|In a tokamak, the {{accurate}} {{estimation of the}} plasma boundary is essential to maximise the fusion performance and is also {{the first line of}} defence for the physical integrity of the device. In particular, the first wall components might get severely damaged if over-exposed to a high plasma thermal load. The most common approach to calculate the plasma geometry and related parameters is based in a large set of different types of magnetic sensors. Using this information, real-time plasma equilibrium codes infer a flux map and calculate the shape and geometry of the plasma boundary and its distance to a known reference (e. g. first wall). These are inputs to one or more controllers capable of acting on the shape and trajectory based in pre-defined requests. Depending on the device, the error of the estimated boundary distance must usually be less than 1 centimetre, which translates into very small errors on the magnetic measurement itself. Moreover, asymmetries in the plasma generated and surrounding magnetic fields can produce local shape deformations potentially leading to an unstable control of the plasma geometry. The JET tokamak was recently upgraded to a new and less thermally robust all-metal wall, also known as the ITER-like wall. Currently the shape controller system uses the output of a single reconstruction algorithm to drive the plasma geometry and the protection systems have no input from the plasma boundary reconstruction. These choices are historical and were due to architectural, hardware and processing power limitations. Taking advantage of new multi-core systems and of the already proved robustness of the JET real-time network, this paper proposes a distributed architecture for the real-time identification of faults in the magnetic measurements of the JET tokamak. Besides detecting simple faults, such as short-circuits and open-loops, the system compares the expected measurement at the <b>coil</b> <b>location</b> and the real measurement, producing a confidence valu-. Several magnetic reconstructions, using sensors from multiple toroidally distributed locations, can run in parallel, allowing for a voting or averaging scheme selection.

Sources considered so far include the displacements and tilts (but not the deformations, yet) {{of the four}} circular coils featured in the simple CNT stellarator. The flux surfaces were measured {{by means of an}} electron beam and phosphor rod, and were computed by means of a Biot-Savart field-line tracing code. If the ideal <b>coil</b> <b>locations</b> and orientations are used in the computation, agreement with measurements is poor. Discrepancies are ascribed to errors in the positioning and orientation of the in-vessel interlocked coils. To that end, an iterative numerical method was developed. A Newton-Raphson algorithm searches for the coils' displacements and tilts that minimize the discrepancy between the measured and computed flux surfaces. This method was verified by misplacing and tilting the coils in a numerical model of CNT, calculating the flux surfaces that they generated, and testing the algorithm's ability to deduce the coils' displacements and tilts.

40|$|Stroke due to subarachnoid {{haemorrhage}} from ruptured cerebral aneurysms {{is one of}} the highest causes of death and economic burden in our society. Aneurysms can be treated by placing coils in the aneurysm to alter the local hemodynamics and lower the wall shear stresses to make the aneurysmal flow inactive. Although velocity measurements have been previously made in models of cerebral aneurysms, no specific information is available for the stress distribution inside lateral aneurysms. A three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was used to investigate the hemodynamics of a pear shaped lateral cerebral aneurysm partially blocked with coils. Stress distribution for different <b>coil</b> <b>locations</b> inside the aneurysm was investigated by using uni-directional Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{practical}} magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scheme for the latest rotating radiofrequency coil (RRFC) design at 9. 4 T. The new prototype RRFC was integrated with an optical sensor to facilitate recording of its angular positions relative to the sequence timing. In imaging, the RRFC was used together with radial k-space trajectories. To recover the image, the radial spokes were grouped according to the <b>coil</b> <b>locations.</b> Using an Eigen-decomposition approach, an array of location-dependent sensitivity maps was extracted from the central regions of the segmented k-space, enabling parallel-imaging techniques for image recovery in a straightforward manner. When the RRFC angular velocity is carefully designed and accurately controlled according to the sequence timing, the encoding by means of varying RRFC sensitivity maps can be accurately calibrated for a faithful image recovery. Approximations were made to counteract the variations of the RRFC angular velocity, providing successful image reconstruction at 9. 4 T.

The approach is based on first calculating an optimal current density map, which is then used to allocate coils for the second stage of the optimization process. Having stated the coil domain, required magnetic field strength and constraint of current density, a set of superconducting magnet coil arrangements can be computed. Low- and high-field magnet coils achieving field strengths of 1, 3, 7 and 11. 75. T are provided for the cylindrical compact designs, 1. T for the asymmetric coil arrangement and 1. T for the open double-doughnut configuration magnet.

T, the maximum fields are located on coils with the smallest radii, whereas at low-field, this is not the case. This becomes a critical observation for high-field applications, as the superconducting magnet design freedom is restricted by inherent peak field limits on superconductors. To reduce the peak field experienced by any coil, the domain has to be made longer, resulting in physically large magnets. Our findings also suggest that at low-field, reverse current coils can be employed to shorten the length of the magnet. When the field strengths is greater than 3.

40|$|Gradient coil {{temperature}} {{is an important}} concern {{in the design and}} construction of MRI scanners. Closely spaced gradient coil windings cause temperature hot spots within the system as a result of Ohmic heating associated with large current being driven through resistive material, and can strongly affect the performance of the coils. In this paper, a model is presented for predicting the spatial temperature distribution of a gradient <b>coil,</b> including the <b>location</b> and extent of temperature hot spots. Subsequently, a method is described for designing gradient coils with improved temperature distributions and reduced hot spot temperatures. Maximum temperature represents a non-linear constraint and a relaxed fixed point iteration routine is proposed to adjust coil windings iteratively to minimise this coil feature. Several examples are considered that assume different thermal material properties and cooling mechanisms for the gradient system. Coil winding solutions are obtained for all cases considered that display a considerable drop in hot spot temperature (> 20 %) when compared to standard minimum power gradient coils with equivalent gradient homogeneity, efficiency and inductance. The method is semi-analytical in nature and can be adapted easily to consider other non-linear constraints in the design of gradient coils or similar systems...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we report}} the crystal {{structure}} at ≈ 4 -Å resolution of a selectively proteolyzed bovine fibrinogen. This key component in hemostasis is an elongated 340 -kDa glycoprotein in the plasma that upon activation by thrombin self-assembles {{to form the}} fibrin clot. The crystals are unusual because they {{are made up of}} end-to-end bonded molecules that form flexible filaments. We have visualized the entire coiled-coil region of the molecule, which has a planar sigmoidal shape. The primary polymerization receptor pockets at the ends of the molecule face the same way throughout the end-to-end bonded filaments, and based on this conformation, we have developed an improved model of the two-stranded protofibril that is the basic building block in fibrin. Near the middle of the coiled-coil region, the plasmin-sensitive segment is a hinge about which the molecule adopts different conformations. This segment also includes the boundary between the three- and four-stranded portions of the coiled <b>coil,</b> indicating the <b>location</b> on the backbone that anchors the extended flexible Aα arm. We suggest that a flexible branch point in the molecule may help accommodate variability {{in the structure of the}} fibrin clot...|$|R

Surakarta: Industrial Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Sebelas Maret University, Juli 2007. PT. Tomoko Daya Perkasa {{is one of}} {{the company}} in a {{metallizing}} industry. The most often material handling equipment using by production division is handlifter. It can be seen at frequency usage of highest material handling appliance for the handlifter. The prime situation from material handling problems, early from less fluent of material intake in floor and in rewindingslitting machine. This matter because of handlifter cannot conducting of material intake which is in form of <b>coil</b> at <b>location</b> in floor and in rewinding machine directly. Other problem at the of conducting of material intake that is in rewinding machine, operator have to use appliance assist. At material intake in floor also there are additional constraint, besides operator have to use the appliance assist, the operator also have to push material to part of lifter. The aim of this research is to overcome constraint that occured in process of material intake using assist previous handling material, so that process material handling can more productive [...] The method is being used in is anthropometry approach. Anthropometry approach is needed to to determine material handling appliance dimension. This research also assess productivity from material handling appliance, use result from material handling simulation model. Simulation model meant as information from material handling condition after conducted redesigning. This research is conducted at material handling operator in PT. Tomoko Daya Perkasa counted 6 people. The result of this research indicate that redesigning material handling appliance assist by using anthropometry approach can reduce processing time become 48. 873, 6 second. Besides that also make improve an productivity index value, that is for the index of material productivity occured improvement equal to 22...|$|R
