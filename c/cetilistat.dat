50|$|<b>Cetilistat</b> is a {{synthetic}} lipase inhibitor. Instead {{of having a}} β-lactone structure {{like most of the}} lipase inhibitors, it has a bicyclic benzoxazinone ring. It is also a lipophilic compound but differs in the hydro- and lipophilic side chain. The structure and more information about <b>Cetilistat</b> is shown in the table on the right.|$|E
50|$|Other {{drugs in}} {{clinical}} trials as of October 2009 include <b>Cetilistat</b> and TM38837.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cetilistat,</b> a new lipase inhibitor, is an {{experimental}} drug for obesity. In October 2016 {{the drug was}} still in clinical trials.Cetilistat was developed to overcome the adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract of orlistat. It has a different structure but similar inhibition activity to the gastrointestinal lipase. However <b>cetilistat</b> interacts differently with the fat micelles from digested food, therefore it has less side effects and better tolerability.|$|E
50|$|A {{published}} phase 2 trial found <b>cetilistat</b> {{significantly reduced}} weight with and was better tolerated than orlistat.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cetilistat</b> has a bicyclic {{structure}} but {{lacks the}} β-lactone ring. It acts {{in a similar}} way as a typical lipase inhibitor that has the β-lactone structure.|$|E
5000|$|The weight-loss pills {{manufactured}} by the Geneherbs Biotechnology Co. (...) {{were found to}} contain unauthorized drugs. The pills product called the Wellslim Plus+ contains <b>cetilistat,</b> a lipase inhibitor designed to treat obesity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cetilistat</b> {{is a drug}} {{designed}} to treat obesity. It acts {{in the same way}} as the older drug orlistat (Xenical) by inhibiting pancreatic lipase, an enzyme that breaks down triglycerides in the intestine. Without this enzyme, triglycerides from the diet are prevented from being hydrolyzed into absorbable free fatty acids and are excreted undigested.|$|E
50|$|In human trials, <b>cetilistat</b> {{was shown}} to produce similar weight loss to orlistat, but also {{produced}} similar side effects such as oily, loose stools, fecal incontinence, frequent bowel movements, and flatulence. It {{is likely that the}} same precautions would apply in that absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and other fat-soluble nutrients may be inhibited, requiring vitamin supplements to be used to avoid deficiencies.|$|E
50|$|Other lipase inhibitors {{have been}} recognized, e.g. from {{different}} plant products. These include alkaloids, carotenoids, glycosides, polyphenols, polysaccharides, saponins and terpenoids. However, {{none of these}} have been used clinically as lipase inhibitors. More active lipase inhibitors are the lipophilic compounds from microbial sources.Lipase inhibitors from microbial source {{can be divided into}} two classes based on their structure. Those who have a β-lactone ring are lipstatin, valilactone, percyquinin, panclicin A-E, ebelactone A and B, vibralactone and esterastin. Those who do not have a β-lactone ring are (E)-4-amino styryl acetate, ε-polylysine and caulerpenyne.Lipase inhibitors have also been made synthetically, e.g. <b>cetilistat,</b> based on the structure of triglycerides and other natural lipase substrates. However, the synthetic lipase inhibitors differ in structure and some of them lack the β-lactone ring.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Obesity is {{a chronic}} disease {{and a major}} health problem which require long term {{treatment}} in developed and affluent society of developing countries. Pharmacotherapies for obesity have to be given for a long duration with lifestyle modifications. Anti-obesity drugs acts through various targets in the body which reduce the food intake, decrease absorption and increase metabolism. Many drugs were approved and {{used in the past}} but were removed or abandoned in the later stages due to the various adverse drug reactions associated with the drugs. At present orlistat is the only approved drugs but it’s also associated with steatorrhoea and other side effects. Lorcaserin and the combination of phentermine and topiramate have shown to reduce greater weight loss and fewer side effects than orlistat. There are new combinations from existing drugs are in various phase of clinical trials like bupropion/naltrexone, bupropion/zonisamide and pramlintide/metreleptin. Many single agents like tesofensine, liraglutide, <b>cetilistat,</b> etc are in various phases of clinical trials and have shown promis...|$|E
40|$|Obese {{patients}} have worse outcomes during acute pancreatitis (AP). Previous animal models of AP have found worse outcomes in obese rodents {{who may have}} a baseline proinflammatory state. Our aim was to study the role of acute lipolytic generation of fatty acids on local severity and systemic complications of AP. Human postpancreatitis necrotic collections were analyzed for unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) and saturated fatty acids. A model of biliary AP was designed to replicate the human variables by intraductal injection of the triglyceride glyceryl trilinoleate alone or with the chemically distinct lipase inhibitors orlistat or <b>cetilistat.</b> Parameters of AP etiology and outcomes of local and systemic severity were measured. Patients with postpancreatitis necrotic collections were obese, and 13 of 15 had biliary AP. Postpancreatitis necrotic collections were enriched in UFAs. Intraductal glyceryl trilinoleate {{with or without the}} lipase inhibitors resulted in oil red O–positive areas, resembling intrapancreatic fat. Both lipase inhibitors reduced the glyceryl trilinoleate–induced increase in serum lipase, UFAs, pancreatic necrosis, serum inflammatory markers, systemic injury, and mortality but not serum alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, or amylase. We conclude that UFAs are enriched in human necrotic collections and acute UFA generation via lipolysis worsens pancreatic necrosis, systemic inflammation, and injury associated with severe AP. Inhibition of lipolysis reduces UFA generation and improves these outcomes of AP without interfering with its induction...|$|E
