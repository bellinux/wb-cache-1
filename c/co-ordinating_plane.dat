40|$|The thesis {{presents}} a spatial curve, called Hippopede of Eudoxus, {{which has the}} shape of a figure eight curved in space and occurs at the intersection of a sphere and a cylinder. A cylinder touches a sphere on the inner side and the axis of the cylinder pierces the sphere twice. The aim of the thesis is to examine the hippopede and its properties. We will describe in detail the projections of hippopede of Eudoxus on the <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>planes.</b> The conclusion offers possibilities of using the curve in primary school. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{low and high}} cycle fatigue {{behaviour}} of ten structural materials is analysed in terms of strain-life, stress-life and cyclic stress-strain curves. Push-pull, strain-controlled fatigue tests are performed and then the experimental data are processed according to the Standards in force as well as following a recent procedure proposed by the authors which ensures the compatibility conditions are satisfied. As a result, a three dimensional representation of the experimental data in a stress-strain-life diagram can be drawn. The stress-life, strain-life and cyclic stress-strain curves are the projection of a unique three-dimensional curve onto the <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>planes...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{middle school}} and high school, {{students}} become acquainted with transformational geometry, and geometry in the <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>plane.</b> This paper addresses some of the reasons students encounter difficulty involving transformational geometry and ways to help students better understand transformational geometry. The discussion moves into the benefits of implementing games into the math classroom and some essential features of quality math games. This paper culminates with a discussion on the creation and design of my transformational game Identity, how Identity can help with students’ understanding and facility with transformational geometry, and a reflection on the game-creating process...|$|R
6000|$|Before we {{deal with}} this, we shall {{introduce}} the following incidental consideration. Up to the present we have only considered events taking place along the embankment, which had mathematically to assume the function of a straight line. In the manner indicated in Section 2 we can imagine this reference-body supplemented laterally and in a vertical direction {{by means of a}} framework of rods, so that an event which takes place anywhere can be localised with reference to this framework. Fig. 2 Similarly, we can imagine the train travelling with the velocity v to be continued across the whole of space, so that every event, no matter how far off it may be, could also be localised with respect to the second framework. Without committing any fundamental error, we can disregard the fact that in reality these frameworks would continually interfere with each other, owing to the impenetrability of solid bodies. In every such framework we imagine three surfaces perpendicular to each other marked out, and designated as [...] " [...] <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>planes</b> [...] " [...] (" [...] co-ordinate system [...] "). A co-ordinate system K then corresponds to the embankment, and a co-ordinate system K' to the train. An event, wherever it may have taken place, would be fixed in space with respect to K by the three perpendiculars x, y, z on the <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>planes,</b> and with regard to time by a time value t. Relative to K1, the same event would be fixed in respect of space and time by corresponding values x1, y1, z1, t1, which of course are not identical with x, y, z, t. It has already been set forth in detail how these magnitudes are to be regarded as results of physical measurements.|$|R
40|$|A convex {{corner is}} a compact convex down-set of full {{dimension}} in R n +. Convex corners arise in graph theory, for instance as stable set polytopes of graphs. They are also natural objects {{of study in}} geometry, as they correspond to 1 -unconditional norms in an obvious way. In this paper, we study a parameter of convex corners, which we call the content, that {{is related to the}} volume. This parameter has appeared before, either implicitly or in special cases, both in geometry and in combinatorics, and a major aim of the paper is to expose connections between work in these two areas. We define the content (S) of a convex corner S in R n + recursively by (S) = max x 2 S n X i= 1 x i (S i); where S i is the projection of S on to the i th <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>plane,</b> and (f 0 g) = 1 for the zerodimensional convex corner f 0 g. As part of his proof of Saint-Raymond's Inequality [...] Vol(S) Vol(S ffi) 1 =n! [...] Meyer [20] effectively showed that (S) n!Vol(S) for any convex corner S. Sidorenko [25 [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Free {{vibration}} of a clamped visco-elastic {{rectangular plate}} having bi-direction exponentially varying thickness has been analysed {{on the basis}} of classical plate theory. For visco-elastic materials, basic elastic and viscous elements are combined. We have assumed the Kelvin model for visco-elasticity, which is a combination of elastic and viscous elements connected in parallel. Here, the elastic element is constituted by a spring and the viscous one is a da-shpot. An approximate but quite convenient frequency equation is derived by using the Rayleigh-Ritz technique. Logarithmic decrement, time period and deflection (at two different instant of time) for the first two modes of vibration and for various values of the taper constants and aspect ratio are calculated. Comparison studies have been carried out with bi-linearly thick-ness variation to establish the accuracy and versatility of the method.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the paper}} the {{sequential}} nonlinear mapping {{has been investigated}} in order to reveal its features. The method was investigated by a plenty of experiments using various sorts of data. For illustrations there are presented results using “marginal ” data: the first data gives the smallest mapping error, and the other data gives the largest one. The sequential nonlinear mapping has been investigated according ability to differ the data groups (clustering) when at the beginning the number of groups is taken {{to be less than}} really exists. It was showed that the sequential nonlinear mapping differs the groups of data well even though the number of them is taken to be less by one than really exists. The experiments show that the factor for correction <b>co-ordinates</b> on the <b>plane</b> for the sequential nonlinear mapping can be taken in the range from 0. 25 to 0. 75. Mapping errors depend on both the sort of initial conditions and the nature of data. Key words: sequential nonlinear mapping, mapping error, initial conditions. 1...|$|R

Primarily developed for real-time airborne computations, {{it uses a}} unique computing technique which is especially suitable for solving the trigonometric relationships involved in <b>plane</b> <b>co-ordinate</b> rotation and conversion from rectangular to polar form. It comprises a special serial arithmetic unit having three shift registers, three adders/subtractors, Look-Up table and special interconnections. Using a prescribed sequence of conditional additions or subtractions the CORDIC arithmetic unit can be controlled to solve either of the following equations: 				Y’=K (Ycos λ+ Xsin λ) 				X’=K (Xcos λ - Ysin λ); where K is a constant In this project: •	A CORDIC-based processor for sine/cosine calculation was designed using VHDL programming in Xilinx ISE 10. 1. The CORDIC module was tested for its functionality and correctness by test-bench analysis. Subsequently, FPGA implementation of the CORDIC core followed by ChipScopePro analysis of the output logic waveforms was performed. •	Using this CORDIC core a DCT processor was designed to calculate the 8 -point 1 D DCT. The functionality and operational correctness of this processor was tested, first on the test-bench and then via ChipScopePro analysis, post FPGA implementation. The output obtained in both the cases was compared with the actual values to test for consistency {{and the percentage of}} accuracy was established. Power consumption and FPGA resource utilization were observed. The results obtained were discussed. ...|$|R
