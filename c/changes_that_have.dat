5|$|Understanding the <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> {{occurred}} during an organism's evolution can reveal the genes needed to construct {{parts of the}} body, genes which {{may be involved in}} human genetic disorders. For example, the Mexican tetra is an albino cavefish that lost its eyesight during evolution. Breeding together different populations of this blind fish produced some offspring with functional eyes, since different mutations had occurred in the isolated populations that had evolved in different caves. This helped identify genes required for vision and pigmentation.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 8, Money, {{describes}} the internal debate at CBC regarding how {{to cover a}} $70 million loss in advertising revenue from the 2008-2009 recession with the government unwilling to cover the deficit or allow CBC to incur debt. Ultimately, they decided on cutting 400 jobs, {{reducing the number of}} episodes ordered, and selling excess real estate. Chapter 9, The Plan, addresses CBC's adaption to new technology and the consolidation of the Canadian telecommunications industry. Stursberg details his struggles with the new CBC president Hubert Lacroix, who did not endorse Stursberg's strategy of providing popular content and initiated a new strategic planning process. In the final chapter Stursberg notes the <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> occurred since his departure and predicts the demise of CBC Sports as it loses NHL rights to CTV/TSN.|$|E

5|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote sensing. Satellite {{synthetic aperture}} radar images of a geographic feature are taken on separate days, and <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> taken place between radar images taken on the separate days are recorded as fringes similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry. The technique can monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in structural engineering, in particular for the monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. Fig20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.|$|E

25|$|The genetic {{history of}} Europe {{encompasses}} {{the history of}} the patterns of genetic diversity among the human populations of the European continent. The history reflects the patterns of demographic and ethnic <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> occurred in Europe throughout time. The primary data comes from sequences of mitochondrial, Y-chromosome and autosomal DNA (including single-nucleotide polymorphisms), from modern populations and, where available, from ancient DNA.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 2,750 {{years of}} its existence, the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture was fairly stable and static; however, there were changes that took place.

However, details of bone shape change throughout life, with bones becoming heavier and more deeply sculptured under the influence of androgens, and HRT does prevent such changes from progressing further.|$|E
