50|$|The {{body of a}} <b>coil</b> <b>car</b> {{consists}} of a trough or series of troughs. Most commonly these run lengthwise, but there are transverse variants as well; in either case they may be lined with wood or other material to cushion the load. The coils are set on their sides in the trough, and stops may be applied across the trough to keep the coils from shifting.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Coil</b> <b>cars</b> (also {{referred}} to as [...] "steel coil cars" [...] or [...] "coil steel cars") are a specialized type of rolling stock designed for the transport of coils (i.e., rolls) of sheet metal, particularly steel. They are considered a subtype of the gondola car, though they bear little resemblance to a typical gondola.|$|R
50|$|Some DIY {{car audio}} hobbyists use choke <b>coils</b> with <b>car</b> audio systems (specifically in the wiring for a subwoofer, to remove high {{frequencies}} from the amplified signal).|$|R
50|$|Petrol engines use spark {{ignition}} and high voltage current for the spark may {{be provided by}} a magneto or an ignition <b>coil.</b> In modern <b>car</b> engines the ignition timing is managed by an electronic Engine Control Unit.|$|R
50|$|Many modern {{car engines}} have {{multiple}} ignition coils (one for {{each pair of}} cylinders) built into a coil pack, {{eliminating the need for}} a distributor and <b>coil</b> wire. Some <b>car</b> engines use a small ignition coil mounted on top of each spark plug, eliminating the need for spark plug wires entirely.|$|R

50|$|This class {{includes}} many topics, specially the classical theory of electromagnetism. In {{addition to the}} basic concepts of electromagnetism, a vast variety of interesting topics are covered in this course: lightning, pacemakers, electric shock treatment, electrocardiograms, metal detectors, musical instruments, magnetic levitation, bullet trains, electric motors, radios, TV, <b>car</b> <b>coils,</b> superconductivity, aurora borealis, rainbows, radio telescopes, interferometers, particle accelerators (a.k.a. atom smashers or colliders), mass spectrometers, red sunsets, blue skies, haloes around Sun and Moon, color perception, Doppler effect, Big-Bang cosmology.|$|R
40|$|The Corona Discharge is an {{phenomena}} {{brought on}} by the ionization of a fluid such as air surrounding a conductor that is electrically charged with high tension and high frequency. Previous studies show how the energy of that electrical discharge can be used for the ignition of a petrol engine, as an alternative for the most used currently, the spark ignition system. That project consists on the design and execution of a control (software and external hardware) with the Arduino Uno microcontroller, which may allow emitting the necessary voltage to generate the Corona Discharge in an ignition <b>coil</b> of a <b>car,</b> from reading the current that goes through it...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To reduce {{noise and}} make the {{structure}} of the car more rational, we established modal test system of car's body-in-white in this paper. Car body-in-white was mounted on rigid platform with four <b>coil</b> springs. The <b>car</b> was excited by an electromagnetic exciter. The method of single-point excitation and multi-point collecting vibration was used in this test. Excitation point was chosen in the bearing beam. Signals picked up by the acceleration sensors were processed in the software of Mescope. With this system, different modal frequencies and modal characteristics of the car are acquired. The results show that modal parameters are effective and reliable and those parameters can be basis for the designer to improve {{the structure of the}} car. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Bluebird {{was also}} made in South Africa (Pretoria) 1978 to 1980 {{as well and}} was called the Datsun 1600J Deluxe,1800j deluxe or 1800J SSS Sedan which had the twin carb set up and a five speed gearbox. A station wagon version with a 1600 cc engine was also made. The cars had the L16 or L18 engines.After a while the cars model name changed to the Datsun Stanza. The cars were all rear wheel drives with solid axle and <b>coil</b> springs. These <b>cars</b> were the last models to have the name Datsun as the later models all had the name Nissan due to the global name change. This car was very popular as it {{reminded}} people of the Datsun P510 models made in 1969 to 1973 in South Africa.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike {{the first}} Escort (which was {{developed}} by Ford of Britain), the second generation was developed jointly between the UK and Ford of Germany. Codenamed [...] "Brenda" [...] during its development, it used the same mechanical components as the Mark I. The 940cc engine was still offered in Italy where the smaller engine attracted tax advantages, but in the other larger European markets in Europe it was unavailable. The estate and van versions used the same panelwork as the Mark I, but with the Mark II front end and interior. The car used a revised underbody, which had been introduced as a running change during {{the last six months}} production of the Mark I. Rear suspension still sat on leaf springs though some contemporaries such as the Hillman Avenger had moved on to <b>coil</b> springs. The <b>car</b> came in for criticism for its lack of oddments space, with a glove compartment only available on higher end models, and its stalk-mounted horn.|$|R
40|$|PARALLEL BEAM NEUTRON COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY RECONSTRUCTION WITH VARIOUS FILTERS. This paper {{presents}} a simple calculation using the MatLab application code for five different filter functions {{to obtain the}} best image quality for parallel beam neutron computed tomography. Shepp-Logan, Ramachandran-Lakshminarayanan, Cosine, Hamming and Hann Filter and without filter were used for a cross-section of a <b>car</b> <b>coil</b> ignitor reconstruction. The reconstruction was also done by varying the number of projections namely 180, 90, 45 and 12. The quality of the image can be determined by viewing the image directly or by using grey level curve to show the signal to noise image. The good images were determined by their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) value. The high SNR values {{were obtained from the}} images which were reconstructed by using hamming and Hann filter. On the other hand the lowest SNR was obtained when the image was reconstructed without any filter. The number of the projections were also influenced the image quality, the more the projection number is used the better the image quality is obtained...|$|R
50|$|The car {{required}} {{modifications to}} accept the new engine. Additional air-intakes were let into {{the sides of the}} car ahead of the rear wheels. The overall length rose by 17 in and the wheelbase rose by 230 mm. Overall width increased by 20 mm due to the addition of larger wheel arches added to clear wider tires, which were 185/70 VR14s at the front and 205/70 VR14s at the rear. The front suspension was unchanged from the original but at the rear suspension was now by lateral links, trailing arms, and <b>coil</b> springs. The <b>car</b> also received ventilated disk brakes and 5-lug wheels. The first prototype used a modified production chassis, while subsequent prototypes used a chassis made of tubular steel. The engine was mounted longitudinally behind the driver and drove the wheels through a Porsche 5-speed transaxle. Due to the output shaft being offset 5 in to the right the half-shafts were of unequal lengths. Top speed for the car was reported to have been 232 kph mph.|$|R
5000|$|An {{ignition}} coil (also called a spark coil) is an induction coil in an automobile's ignition system that transforms the battery's low voltage {{to the thousands}} of volts needed to create an electric spark in the spark plugs to ignite the fuel. Some coils have an internal resistor, while others rely on a resistor wire or an external resistor to limit the current flowing into the <b>coil</b> from the <b>car's</b> 12-volt supply. The wire that goes from the {{ignition coil}} to the distributor and the high voltage wires that go from the distributor to each of the spark plugs are called spark plug wires or high tension leads. Originally, every ignition coil system required mechanical contact breaker points and a capacitor (condenser). More recent electronic ignition systems use a power transistor to provide pulses to the ignition coil. A modern passenger automobile may use one ignition coil for each engine cylinder (or pair of cylinders), eliminating fault-prone spark plug cables and a distributor to route the high voltage pulses.|$|R
25|$|The {{control of}} the time machine is the same in all three films. The {{operator}} is seated inside the DeLorean (except the first time, when a remote control is used), and turns on the time circuits, activating a unit containing multiple fourteen- and seven-segment displays that show the destination (red), present (green), and last-departed (yellow) dates and times. After entering a target date, the operator accelerates the car to , which activates the flux capacitor. As it accelerates, several coils around the body glow blue/white while a burst of light appears in front of it. Surrounded by electrical current similar to a Tesla <b>coil,</b> the whole <b>car</b> vanishes {{in a flash of}} white/blue light seconds later, leaving a pair of fiery tire tracks. A digital speedometer is attached to the dashboard so that the operator can accurately gauge the car's speed. Various proposals have been brought forth in the past by fans of the movie franchise for why the car has to be moving at 88mph to achieve temporal displacement, but actually the production crew chose the velocity simply because they liked how it looked on the speedometer.|$|R
