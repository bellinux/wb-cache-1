In the end the Senate approved a smaller cutback, citing a 24% spike in Amtrak ridership after an oil shock during the summer, but the North Coast Hiawatha remained on the <b>chopping</b> <b>block.</b> In late September the Railway Labor Executives' Association, along with Senator John Melcher (D-Montana) and Representative Pat Williams (D-Montana), sued the U.S. Department of Transportation to prevent the discontinuance of the service, then scheduled for October 1. A federal judge temporarily restrained Amtrak from ending the service, but the last North Coast Hiawathas ran on October 6, 1979, arriving in Chicago on the 7th and Seattle on the 8th.|$|E
25|$|According {{to local}} tradition, the church became barracks during the American Revolution and was, {{like most other}} Anglican churches in Virginia, {{abandoned}} after either the Revolution or Episcopal Church's disestablishment circa 1794. American soldiers reportedly slaughtered animals in the courtyard and used the communion table as a <b>chopping</b> <b>block,</b> although its surface was later restored. By the War of 1812, the church had fallen into ruin and an “American patrol” used the baptismal fort as a drinking bowl, {{so that it was}} carried away and found on a nearby farm. They also allegedly made unspecified repairs to the brick walls.|$|E
25|$|The communion {{table is}} the oldest {{in the state and}} is of {{undoubtedly}} an original feature of this church. It is a walnut table with dimension of 65 inches × 30”. It has baluster-like, robust legs and a bottom rail on all four sides. The molding of the edge of the upper rail is a reversed S (cyma reversa). Reportedly it was used as a <b>chopping</b> <b>block</b> by an American patrol during the War of 1812, and it shows a documented disregard of the sacerdotal nature of communion tables in early American churches cited by Upton as including: use as a desk for in-church schools, use as a hat table, instances of their being “pushed around carelessly,” going so far that stray dogs stole the communion bread and even urinated on the table legs. Hence, regulations were passed that the table in each church must be located on the east wall and that a protective rail be erected around it. The use of any church as a school, in particular, is puzzling because most colonial vestries scrupulously avoided using the church even for parish business, meeting in a separate vestry house close by a church or in the room formed by bell towers such as at St. Peter’s, New Kent County. The vestry house for this church remained as a ruin just outside the west wall until 1820.|$|E

2500|$|No one {{was really}} safe from {{scrutiny}} or the <b>chopping</b> <b>block,</b> ultimately not even Robespierre himself. This omnipresent sense of fear inspired many of lesser means to flee France, often without much preparation and therefore no money or helpful belongings. Those who left France were a heterogeneous bunch socioeconomically and professionally, although {{the vast majority}} of migrants were men. While these people came from diverse financial backgrounds, they all more or less suffered the same poverty while traveling. In his thesis [...] "'La Généreuse Nation!' Britain and the French Emigration 1792-1802", Callum Whittaker recounts that while leaving France one aristocrat [...] "disguised herself as a sailor, and hid for a day in the hold of a ship underneath a pile of ropes". [...] Also, captains and sailors saw {{this as an opportunity to}} earn a little on the side, and so they levied taxes on the emigrants, leaving them on the shores of another nation with nothing. Yet still, thousands chose this path of discomfort and destitution because it at least provided the promise of peace.|$|E
