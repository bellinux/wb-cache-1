5|$|Philosophical behaviorism {{has fallen}} out of favor since {{the latter half of}} the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of <b>cognitivism.</b> Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several {{perceived}} problems. For example, behaviorism could be said to be counter-intuitive when it maintains that someone is talking about behavior in the event that a person is experiencing a painful headache.|$|E

Through the influence of Dreyfus's critique and neurophysiological alternative, Merleau-Ponty became associated with neurophysiological, connectionist accounts of cognition.|$|E

25|$|Because {{ethology}} {{is considered}} a topic of biology, ethologists have been concerned particularly with the evolution of behaviour and the understanding of behaviour {{in terms of the}} theory of natural selection. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals influenced many ethologists. He pursued his interest in behaviour by encouraging his protégé George Romanes, who investigated animal learning and intelligence using an anthropomorphic method, anecdotal <b>cognitivism,</b> that did not gain scientific support.|$|E
25|$|CTR as {{pedagogy}} {{has been}} almost universally employed by schools {{since its inception in}} the late nineteenth century, and until the 1960s, its limitations and ineffectiveness received little criticism. However, the 1966 Dartmouth Conference reflected an influx of new scholarly ideas about composition studies that introduced the ideas of process over product and the notion that teachers should serve as guides in the composition process rather than dictatorial authority figures. Since then, the main elements of composition pedagogy have been defined and explored by countless scholars, and the concepts associated with CTR have been replaced by a wealth of pedagogical approaches to the field of rhetoric and composition. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the field of rhetoric and composition saw a process revolution, fueled by two distinct pedagogies: expressivism, both moderate and radical, and <b>cognitivism.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} thought {{is central to}} {{psychology}} and related fields. Cognitive psychology studies cognition, the mental processes' underlying behavior. It uses information processing {{as a framework for}} understanding the mind. Perception, learning, problem solving, memory, attention, language and emotion are all well researched areas as well. Cognitive psychology is associated with a school of thought known as <b>cognitivism,</b> whose adherents argue for an information processing model of mental function, informed by positivism and experimental psychology. Techniques and models from cognitive psychology are widely applied and form the mainstay of psychological theories in many areas of both research and applied psychology. Largely focusing {{on the development of the}} human mind through the life span, developmental psychology seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age. This may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or moral development. Psychologists have developed intelligence tests and the concept of intelligence quotient in order to assess the relative intelligence of human beings and study its distribution among population.|$|E

2500|$|The {{pedagogy}} of <b>cognitivism</b> {{prevalent in}} the early 1970s and early 1980s also promotes the idea of process over product, {{but it is a}} more scientific approach to composition studies and is opposed to moderate expressivism in many ways. Abstractly speaking, cognitivists believe that thinking exists in the mind apart from language and are concerned with understanding how language—or writing—is developed from mental processes of the mind. Cognitivists are primarily concerned with the goals of a writer, the decisions made during the writing process by the mind. Andrea Lunsford addresses the importance of understanding the cognitive mental faculties involved during composition, claiming {{that the best way to}} facilitate the writing process is through workshops and discussion rather than lecture-based instruction. [...] Researchers like cognitivist Sondra Perl conduct extensive studies of the composing process and the stages through which a writer goes in order to better understand how to teach writing. Cognitivists Linda Flower and John Hayes see an exigency in composition studies to understand how and why a writer makes the choices they do during the writing process. Their research led them to claim that writing is a non-linear, hierarchal, goal-driven process. In addition, they concentrate their study of composition on the protocol of the writing process, including planning, translating, embedding, and reviewing. While like expressivists in their greater concern with the process of writing than with the final product, distinguishing them from the essay-driven pedagogy of current-traditional rhetoric, <b>cognitivism</b> proposes a more scientific approach by studying universal cognitive faculties of the mind in order to better understand the composition process.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike <b>cognitivism,</b> social constructionism, or the “social turn” in {{composition}} pedagogy, which evolved the 1980s, is distinguished by {{the belief that}} language and the mind are inseparable, as an individual needs language in order to even think. Social constructionist theories also promote the idea that writing is inherently political in nature and that writers are each {{a part of a}} particular community of dialogue, or discourse community, with an assumed set of principles and a distinct language of its own. Patricia Bizzell directly attacks the early cognitivist contention that writing can be understood as distinct sets of mental processes, criticizing “inner-directed” theorists like Flowers and Hayes for focusing too much on the individual writer’s language and learning processes and overlooking the importance of society and discourse communities {{in composition}}; on the other hand, “outer-directed” theorists like Bizzell recognize the extent to which thinking and language are conditioned by the social context and intended audience being addressed by the writer. Writing, Bizzell claims, “takes place within a community,” and in order to improve composition, teachers should “explain what the community’s conventions are." [...] Social constructionist James Porter notes the “intertextuality” of all writing as interdependent, based on the principle that all speech and writing evolves from presumed meaning and accepted evidence as defined by each “discourse community,” which Porter defines as “a group of individuals bound by a common interest who communicate through approved channels and whose discourse is regulated.” Joseph Harris agrees with Porter, maintaining that writing is community-driven and noting that the purpose in writing is drawn from “being part of some ongoing discourse.” However, Harris qualifies his argument by noting that, while writers act not as isolated individuals but as members of discourse communities with certain language, practices, and beliefs, the notion that academic or other discourse communities are “discursive utopias” existing without conflict is irrational. David Bartholomae suggests that students must be assimilated to a specialized discourse in order to write; he writes that students “have to invent the university by assembling and mimicking its language,” learning the “requirements of [...] convention,” and understanding the “history of a discipline” in order to successfully write and communicate within that discipline. Suggesting an existing conflict between academics and writers, Peter Elbow argues that writing students should not be exposed to the dialogic discourse of academia, as it can be intimidating and ineffective; instead, Elbow suggests that students read and study each other’s writings {{in the early stages of}} composition, in order to facilitate a sense of monologic freedom by focusing on the students’ own unique voices.|$|E

50|$|Studies {{of how we}} know {{in ethics}} divide into <b>cognitivism</b> and non-cognitivism; {{this is similar to}} the {{contrast}} between descriptivists and non-descriptivists.

This is also largely a reductionist goal, with the belief that individual components of mental function (the 'cognitive architecture') can be identified and meaningfully understood. The second is the belief that cognition consists of discrete, internal mental states (representations or symbols) whose manipulation can be described in terms of rules or algorithms..|$|E
50|$|Leahey {{said that}} {{cognitive}} scientists {{believe in a}} revolution because it provides them with an origin myth which constitutes a beginning that will help in legitimizing their science.

The change from behaviorism to <b>cognitivism</b> was gradual. Rather a slowly evolving science which took the origins of behaviorism and built on it.
