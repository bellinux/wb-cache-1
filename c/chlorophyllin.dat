These additives can impart, to deepen or renew the colour of the product, if it has been lost while processing. They also improve the taste of the product and facilitate its identification.

Presently, more and more conscious con­sumers are demanding products to be coloured with natural pigments or any pigment added to the final product. Artificial pigments are considered to be harmful and undesirable so food manufacturers focus on the use of natural colour substances. 16 natural pigments are presently permitted to be used.

40|$|International audienceCoupled to {{increasing}} consumer demand, food manufacturers have moved towards increased usage of approved natural colours. There {{is a legal}} requirement for governments to monitor the consumption of all food additives in the EU to ensure the ADIs are not exceeded, especially by young children. Validated analytical methods are needed to fulfil this requirement. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review the available literature on methods of extraction for approved natural colours in food and drink. Available analytical methods for the determination of EU-permitted natural food colour additives in foods and beverages have been critically assessed for their fitness for purpose in terms of their the key extraction and analysis procedures, selectivity (range) and sensitivity, especially with regard to maximum permitted levels, and their applicability for use in surveillance and in an enforcement role. The advantages and disadvantages of available analytical methods for each of nine designated chemical classes (groups) of natural colours in different food and beverage matrices are given. Other important factors such as technical requirements, cost, transferability and applicability are given due consideration. Gaps in the knowledge and levels of validation are identified and recommendations made on further research to develop suitable methods. The nine designated natural colour classes covered are: 1.

Sodium copper <b>chlorophyllin</b> complex is being used therapeutically as a component in anti-aging cosmeceuticals, and {{has been shown to}} have anti-hyaluronidase activity. In this study we evaluated various commercial lots of sodium copper <b>chlorophyllin</b> complex to identify the primary small molecule constituents, and to test various sodium copper <b>chlorophyllin</b> complexes and their small molecule analog compounds for hyaluronidase inhibitory activity in vitro. Ascorbate analogs were tested in combination with copper <b>chlorophyllin</b> complexes for potential additive or synergistic activity. Materials and methods: For hyaluronidase activity assays, dilutions of test materials were evaluated for hydrolytic activity of hyaluronidase by precipitation of non-digested hyaluronate by measuring related turbidity at 595 nm. High-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy was used to analyze and identify the primary small molecule constituents in various old and new commercial lots of sodium copper <b>chlorophyllin</b> complex. Results: The most active small molecule component of sodium copper <b>chlorophyllin</b> complex was disodium copper isochlorin e 4, followed by oxidized disodium copper isochlorin e 4. Sodium copper <b>chlorophyllin</b> complex and copper isochlorin e 4 disodium salt had hyaluronidase inhibitory activity down to 10 µg/mL. The oxidized form of copper isochlorin e 4 disodium salt had substantial hyaluronidase inhibitory activity at 100 µg/mL but not at 10 µg/mL. Ascorbate derivatives did not enhance the hyaluronidase inhibitory activity of sodium copper <b>chlorophyllin.</b> Copper isochlorin e 4 analogs were always the dominant components of the small molecule content of the commercial lots tested; oxidized copper isochlorin e 4 was found in increased concentrations in older compared to newer lots tested.

Patients and methods: Following a previously published 12 -day clinical assessment model, skin biopsy samples from the forearms of four healthy females with signs of photoaged skin were obtained and samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for key biomarkers of aging skin after each subject was treated with a test material consisting of a gel containing a liposomal dispersion of sodium copper <b>chlorophyllin</b> complex 0. 05 %, a positive control of tretinoin cream 0. 025 %, and an untreated negative control. Results: There was a statistically significantly greater amount of fibrillin/amyloid P and epidermal mucins found for skin treated with the test material containing 0. 05 % sodium copper <b>chlorophyllin</b> complex and the reference control tretinoin 0. 025 % cream compared to the negative control (untreated site).

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThe {{antimutagenic}} {{activity of}} <b>chlorophyllin</b> and hematin was investigated with the Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98 and TA 100 {{by means of}} the Amestest. Benzo(a) pyrene, the food pyrolysate 2 -amino- 1 -methyl- 6 - phenylimidazo [4, 5]pyridine or PhIP and 2 - aminoanthracene were used as mutagens in most experiments. These agents exert mutagenic activity only in the presence of mamalian metabolic activation. In all experiments the mutagenic activity of the three chemicals could be abolished by the presence of 2 mg of <b>chlorophyllin</b> or 0, 5 mg of hematin per selection plate. Considering the results of experiments in which <b>chlorophyllin</b> and hematin were added at several different times after the addition of the metabolic activation system it was concluded that the formed mutagenic metabolites were trapped and inactivated by these porfyrines. The antimutagenic activities of these porfyrines decreased when the porfyrine ring was destroyed as appeared from experiments with biliverdin and bilirubin. Due to its low solubility the antimutagenic activity of chlorophyll is not or nearly not demonstrable. The antimutagenic activity of <b>chlorophyllin</b> or hematin on substances that are mutagenic in the absence of metabolic activation such as MNNG, furazolidone, dimetridazole, epichlorohydrin and 2 -chloroethanol is lower or absent...|$|E
