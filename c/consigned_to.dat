5|$|The series {{attracted}} {{criticism for}} making generalizations about sexual identity, namely that homosexual men are inherently more fashionable and stylish than heterosexuals. Among those making this critique were Tom Shales in the Washington Post ("stereotypes on parade"), Richard Goldstein in Village Voice ("Haven't fags always been <b>consigned</b> <b>to</b> {{the role of}} body servant?") and United States Congressman Barney Frank speaking to the New York Post.|$|E
5|$|Williams was <b>consigned</b> <b>to</b> {{a six-month}} {{hospital}} leave and numerous surgical operations {{due to the}} injuries sustained during the battle.

5|$|But in the {{following}} seven months, Cairano records successive advances and balances for trophies in full production mode that does not affect his other works, whereas Tamagnino only realises two Caesars and seventeen leonine busts. The creation of leonine busts was considered repetitive and could be <b>consigned</b> <b>to</b> low calibre stonecutters, and Tamagnino was paid {{much less than the}} average payment received by Cairano for artefacts of the same type.|$|E

5|$|Coatbridge {{also had}} a notorious {{reputation}} for air pollution and the worst excesses of industry. By {{the time of the}} 1920s however, coal seams were exhausted and the iron industry in Coatbridge was in rapid decline. After the Great Depression the Gartsherrie ironwork was the last remaining iron works in the town. One publication has commented that in modern-day Coatbridge 'coal, iron and steel have all been <b>consigned</b> <b>to</b> the heritage scrap heap'.|$|E
5|$|Films {{released}} {{during the}} dump months {{have not always}} been <b>consigned</b> <b>to</b> cinematic oblivion. Some, like Tremors and Office Space, have become cult classics. Starting with Cloverfield, some 21st-century dump-months releases have managed to exceed $100 million on box office receipts. The similar success of low-budget horror films like The Devil Inside and Mama in the early 2010s has prompted studios to release films in that genre at times of the year other than Halloween and the dump months.|$|E
5|$|The Sirens and Ulysses {{was painted}} using an {{experimental}} technique, which {{caused it to}} begin to deteriorate {{as soon as it}} was complete. It was shown in a major London exhibition of Etty's work in 1849 and at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester, but was then considered in too poor a condition for continued public display and was placed in the gallery's archives. Restoration began on the work in 2003, and in 2010 the painting went on display in the Manchester Art Gallery, over 150 years after being <b>consigned</b> <b>to</b> storage.|$|E

5|$|The Inclosure Act {{separated}} Gateshead Fell into Wrekenton and Sheriff Hill (collectively High Fell) plus Low Fell. Commissioners {{were appointed}} to settle claims in land and to apportion Gateshead Fell accordingly. Plans were laid for the requisition {{and construction of}} wells (including Carter's Well; located on Durham Road and accompanied today by a commemorative Gateshead blue plaque), quarries, drains, roads, watering places and other essential requirements. Progress was slow, with the last allotment disputes not settled until 1822, {{but by the time}} of completion, Gateshead Fell was entirely enclosed and effectively <b>consigned</b> <b>to</b> history. The divisions of Gateshead Fell have remained more or less settled, so that the villages created by enclosure have survived, almost entirely intact, to the present day.|$|E
5|$|The United States Cabinet has had 22 African-American {{appointed}} officers. The US Census Bureau defines African Americans {{as citizens}} or {{residents of the}} United States who have origins {{in any of the}} black populations of Africa. The term is generally used for Americans with at least partial ancestry in any of the original peoples of sub-Saharan Africa. During the founding of the federal government, African Americans were <b>consigned</b> <b>to</b> a status of second-class citizenship or enslaved. No African American ever held a Cabinet position before the Civil Rights Movement or the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and labor unions.|$|E
5|$|There are {{variants}} {{within this}} tradition. Some versions give {{the credit for}} finding the child to Queen Kirupanci of Chandragiri. Others omit mention of the king of Chandragiri altogether, and omit reference to the Koovagam temple. Instead they focus on the demon Kuttacuran and an apparently impossible boon granted {{to him that he}} will be killed by a person having only a head and who was born from water. Vishnu, incarnated as Krishna, informs the gods that Aravan will kill this demon. With this in mind, the head of Aravan is <b>consigned</b> <b>to</b> the river and is transformed into a child called Kuttan ("born from water"), who kills the demon.|$|E

5000|$|Confiscation (from the Latin confiscare [...] "to <b>consign</b> <b>to</b> the fiscus, i.e. {{transfer}} to the treasury") is a legal form of seizure by a government or other public authority.

5|$|In 1952, McNicoll was {{appointed}} {{chairman of the}} planning committee for the British nuclear tests on the Montebello Islands, {{off the coast of}} Western Australia. Later that year, he was made commanding officer of the heavy cruiser , a post he held for the next two years. As commander of Australia, McNicoll also served as Chief Staff Officer to the Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet. HMAS Australia was near the end of its naval service and had been relegated to training duties from 1950. As such, the cruiser was primarily <b>consigned</b> <b>to</b> Australian waters, though a brief trip to New Zealand did occur in October 1953. McNicoll {{was appointed}} a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1954 New Year Honours List for his involvement in the British atomic program; he was presented with the decoration three months later by Queen Elizabeth II in a ceremony at Government House, Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} Positivists in Brazil was Lieutenant-colonel Benjamim Constant, a professor in the Military Academy. Although admired to the point of veneration by the young cadets, he was completely unknown to the public. Constant and other Positivist instructors inculcated students with his ideology. Gradually <b>consigned</b> <b>to</b> the background of the Academy's curriculum were military exercises and military studies of Antoine-Henri Jomini and Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz, replaced by a focus on political discussions and readings from Auguste Comte and Pierre Lafitte. The cadets soon became insubordinate political agitators. Even so, Positivists still expected to make a peaceful transition to their fantasy of a republican dictatorship and Constant, who had also taught the emperor's grandsons, met with Pedro II and tried to convince him join their cause. Unsurprisingly, given Pedro II's character, this proposal was steadfastly refused, and Constant began to believe that there was no remaining alternative to a coup d'Ã©tat.|$|E
5|$|McAloney was {{presented}} with his Albert Medal by the acting Governor-General of Australia, William Vanneck, 5th Baron Huntingfield, in a ceremony at Parliament House, Melbourne on 31 May 1938. McAloney recovered sufficiently from his injuries {{to return to his}} duties with the RAAF, and in September was attached to No.1 Aircraft Depot for a period of three months. During this time he was promoted to leading aircraftman, before returning to service with No.1 Squadron. He was formally transferred to No.1 Aircraft Depot from August 1939, and was advanced to corporal on 1 September that year. With the outbreak of the Second World War, McAloney received a rapid series of promotions over the following eighteen months, first to sergeant in April 1940, flight sergeant in March 1941, and finally to warrant officer in February 1942. He was primarily <b>consigned</b> <b>to</b> engine repair and engineering staff work in Australia during the conflict. After making sergeant, he became No.1 Aircraft Depot's non-commissioned officer in charge of overhaul and test work on the Rolls-Royce Kestrel engine. His duties were expanded with his March 1941 promotion to include the overhaul, inspection and testing of both the Kestrel and Rolls-Royce Merlin aircraft engines.|$|E

Raast traveled to New York City {{to meet with the}} Huertista agent Abraham Ratner and Marquard and Company, Importers to purchase twenty machine guns to add to the stockpile already warehoused in the city. Raast then met with the president of Gans Steamship Line who would transport the contraband for him but could not legally <b>consign</b> the weapons <b>to</b> a port in Mexico, however, he would <b>consign</b> <b>to</b> a port in Odessa, Russia.|$|R
5000|$|Their second release, {{entitled}} <b>Consign</b> <b>to</b> Oblivion, {{was influenced}} by the culture of the Maya civilization, which can be noticed on songs in the [...] "A New Age Dawns" [...] series. [...] "A New Age Dawns" [...] refers to the time system of the Mayan people, which extends up to 2012, and makes no reference of what may happen past said year. <b>Consign</b> <b>to</b> Oblivion was composed with film scores as a basis, with Hans Zimmer and Danny Elfman cited as major inspirations. The album features guest singing by Roy Khan (from Kamelot) on the song [...] "Trois Vierges". Epica also joined Kamelot as a support band on parts of their tour for promotion of The Black Halo album, to which Simons had contributed her vocals on the track [...] "The Haunting (Somewhere in Time)".Two singles were released from the album, [...] "Solitary Ground" [...] and [...] "Quietus".|$|R
