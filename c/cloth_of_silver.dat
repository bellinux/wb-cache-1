5|$|In April 1553 Dudley was {{commanded}} by the King to release <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> and gold and velvet for {{the marriage of}} his nephew Lord Guildford to Lady Jane Grey, which was celebrated on 25 May. In June, Jehan de Scheyfve reported that Dudley himself would marry Margaret Clifford, a granddaughter of Mary Tudor, Queen of France, and cousin of Lady Jane, {{and that he would}} be made Lieutenant-Governor of the North. Dudley had even reserved a number of items from the wardrobe at Westminster for the marriage, including jewels, silver and gilt cups, a hair-brush, velvet dog-collars, and a pair of pictures of Diana and Actaeon. However, Edward VI died on 6 July 1553, having named Lady Jane Grey as his heir.|$|E

60|$|Then all {{the people}} arose and shouted, so that their voices sounded like the storm upon the Cornish coast, when the dark waves run upon the shore and leap and break, surging amid the rocks; so, amid the roaring and the surging of the people, and the waving of scarfs and kerchiefs, the King and Queen came to their place, and, getting down from their horses, mounted the broad stairs {{that led to the}} raised platform, and there took their seats on two thrones bedecked with purple silks and <b>cloths</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> and <b>of</b> gold.|$|R
5000|$|Mrs. Fulhame's {{work began}} with her {{interest}} in finding way <b>of</b> staining <b>cloth</b> with heavy metals {{under the influence of}} light. She originally considered calling her work An Essay on the Art <b>of</b> making <b>Cloths</b> <b>of</b> Gold, <b>Silver,</b> and other Metals, by chymical processes, but considering the [...] "imperfect state of the art", decided to select a title reflecting the broader implications of her experiments. [...] "The possibility <b>of</b> making <b>cloths</b> <b>of</b> gold, <b>silver,</b> and other metals, by chymical processes, occurred to me in the year 1780: the project being mentioned to Doctor Fulhame, and some friends, was deemed improbable. However, after some time, I had the satisfaction of realizing the idea, in some degree, by experiment." ...|$|R
5000|$|The general lines {{permitted}} to their métier were set out under Charles IX, in 1570, as: [...] "Wholesale merchants, drapers and jewelers, in such way that under this status of wholesaler (estat de grossier) {{have been included}} at all times the merchants <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> gold, <b>of</b> <b>silver,</b> <b>of</b> silk... tapestries, jewellery, spiced goods, textiles, hammered copper, silk thread, hardware and the like, {{of which it is}} not {{permitted to}} have any manufacture whatsoever, but only to sell, buy, display, bedeck and beautify all kinds of merchandise" ...|$|R

60|$|Sakr-el-Bahr alone, {{a solitary}} figure, resplendent in caftan and turban that were of <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver,</b> leaned upon the bulwarks of the {{larboard}} {{quarter of the}} poop-deck, and looked moodily back upon the receding city of Algiers which by now {{was no more than}} an agglomeration of white cubes piled up the hillside in the morning sunshine.|$|E
60|$|She {{appeared}} {{above me}} {{in a great}} effulgence that emanated from herself {{as if she were}} grown luminous. Her robe was of <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> and of a dazzling sheen, and it hung closely to her lissom, virginal form, defining every line and curve of it; and by the chaste beauty of her I was moved to purest ecstasy of awe and worship.|$|E
50|$|Even {{before he}} was {{admitted}} to the Mercers' Company in 1507, Lok had already supplied <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> gold and <b>silver</b> to Henry VIII. During the course of his visits as a mercer to the annual markets in Antwerp and Bergen op Zoom in the Low Countries, he collected intelligence which he passed on to the King and his chief minister, Thomas Cromwell.|$|R
60|$|Ever since grey dawn, in {{the lower}} of the two islands, just above where we are standing, there has been great clamour, {{and the sound of}} many workmen. The great {{pavilion}} brought there yester eve is being raised, and carpenters are busy nailing tiers of seats, while ’prentices from London town are there with many-coloured stuffs and silks and <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> gold and <b>silver.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{was about}} a month after this that Mary passed from the Tower through the city of London in a grand triumphal {{procession}} to be crowned. The royal chariot, covered with <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> golden tissue, was drawn by six horses most splendidly caparisoned. Elizabeth, who had aided her sister, so far as she could, in the struggle, was admitted to share the triumph. She had a carriage drawn by six horses too, with <b>cloth</b> and decorations <b>of</b> <b>silver.</b> They proceeded in this manner, attended and followed by a great cavalcade of nobles and soldiery, to Westminster Abbey, where Mary took her seat with great formality upon her father's throne.|$|R
6000|$|How {{magnificent}} {{were the}} surroundings {{of the great}} Duke, it would be wearisome to tell. The retainers {{in the court of}} the hotel looked, as James said, as if honest steel and good cloth were reckoned as churls, and as if this were the very land of Cockaigne, as Sir Richard Whittington had dreamt it. Neither he nor St. Andrew himself would know their own saltire made in <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver,</b> 'the very metal to tarnish!' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{favourite}} Earl was now apparelled all in white, {{his shoes}} being of white velvet; his under-stocks (or stockings) of knit silk; his upper stocks of white velvet, lined with <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver,</b> which was {{shown at the}} slashed part of the middle thigh; his doublet of <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver,</b> the close jerkin of white velvet, embroidered with silver and seed-pearl, his girdle and the scabbard of his sword of white velvet with golden buckles; his poniard and sword hilted and mounted with gold; and over all a rich, loose robe of white satin, with a border of golden embroidery a foot in breadth. The collar of the Garter, and the azure garter itself around his knee, completed the appointments of the Earl of Leicester; which were so well matched by his fair stature, graceful gesture, fine proportion of body, and handsome countenance, that at that moment he was admitted by all who saw him as the goodliest person whom they had ever looked upon. Sussex and the other nobles were also richly attired, but in point of splendour and gracefulness of mien Leicester far exceeded them all.|$|E
6000|$|Eleven o'clock had struck; {{the last}} auditor {{had entered the}} church; the deep tones of the organ began to swell through the sacred pile, yet still the {{archbishop}} came not! The heart of the princess beat quicker and quicker with vague apprehension; when a valet, dressed in <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver,</b> trimmed with crimson velvet, approached her carriage precipitately. [...] "Madame," [...] said he, [...] "the archbishop is in the church; he entered by the portal of the cloister; he {{is already in the}} sanctuary; the ceremony is about to commence!" ...|$|E
50|$|Special cloths (not {{necessarily}} made of linen) {{cover the}} altar in many Christian churches during services and celebrations, {{and are often}} left on the altar {{when it is not}} in use. At the turn of the 20th century the Roman Catholic Church considered only linen or hemp to be acceptable as material for altar cloths, although in earlier centuries silk or <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> gold or <b>silver</b> were used. The Anglican Communion had similar rules in that period.|$|R
60|$|At {{the head}} of the cavalcade went twenty-four sumpter-mules, laden with coffers and other baggage under draperies {{embroidered}} with Cesare's arms--prominent among which would be the red bull, the emblem of his house, and the three-pointed flame, his own particular device. Behind these came another twenty-four mules, caparisoned in the king's colours of scarlet and gold, to be followed in their turn by sixteen beautiful chargers led by hand, similarly caparisoned, and their bridles and stirrups <b>of</b> solid <b>silver.</b> Next came eighteen pages on horseback, sixteen of whom were in scarlet and yellow, whilst the remaining two were in <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> gold. These were followed by a posse of lacqueys in the same liveries and two mules laden with coffers draped with <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> gold, which contained the gifts of which Cesare was the bearer. Behind these rode the duke's thirty gentlemen, in <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> gold and <b>silver,</b> and amongst them came the duke himself.|$|R
50|$|The later orle {{retained}} its padded, roll-like, appearance, but {{was made of}} fine woven material, silk or velvet, often incorporating bands <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> gold or <b>silver.</b> The orles <b>of</b> richer knights and nobles were decorated with jewels. In the manuscript depicting the life of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick the earl is described at a tournament wearing a bascinet decorated with a “chapellet rich of perle and precious stones”. The orle is relatively often represented on English sculptural tomb effigies, usually of alabaster, {{during the first half}} of the 15th century. However, it is very rarely shown on contemporary two-dimensional memorial brasses, which also depict men wearing bascinets.|$|R
6000|$|All of {{the fifty}} sat upon coal-black horses, with saddles {{of silver and}} {{housings}} of silk and velvet embroidered with gold. In {{the midst of all}} the five-and-seventy there rode a youth in <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> embroidered in pearls. In his hand he bore something wrapped in a white napkin, and that was the present for the king such as no other king could give. So said the Demon: [...] "Take it to the royal palace, and tell his majesty that it is from the Tailor of Tailors, the Master of Masters, and One Greater than a King." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{stepped in}} at an open window, {{and there he}} found himself in a {{beautiful}} room, hung with <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> and blue, and with chairs and tables of white and gold; dozens and scores of waxlights shone like so many stars, and lit every crack and cranny as bright as day, and there {{at one end of the}} room upon a couch, with her eyelids closed and fast asleep, lay the prettiest princess that ever the sun shone upon. The soldier stood and looked and looked at her, and looked and looked at her, until his heart melted within him like soft butter, and then he kissed her.|$|E
60|$|Truth to tell, the {{sometime}} Cornish gentleman {{was difficult}} to discern in him as he sat there still wearing the caftan of <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> over his white tunic and a turban of the same material swathed about his steel headpiece that ended in a spike. Idly he swung his brown sinewy legs, naked from knee to ankle, with the inscrutable calm of the fatalist upon his swarthy hawk face with its light agate eyes and black forked beard; and those callous seamen who had assembled there to jeer and mock him were stricken silent by the intrepidity and stoicism of his bearing {{in the face of}} death.|$|E
60|$|Her godmother {{only just}} touched {{her with her}} wand, and, at the same instant, her clothes were turned into <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> gold and <b>silver,</b> all beset with jewels. This done, she gave her a pair of glass slippers, the prettiest in the whole world. Being thus decked out, she got up into her coach; but her godmother, above all things, {{commanded}} her not to stay till after midnight, telling her, at the same time, that if she stayed one moment longer, the coach would be a pumpkin again, her horses mice, her coachman a rat, her footmen lizards, and her clothes become {{just as they were}} before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou shalt have thy desire," [...] {{said the}} Demon. Thereupon he smote his hands {{together}} like a clap of thunder, and instantly {{the walls of the}} room clove asunder, and there came out four-and-twenty handsome youths, clad in <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> gold and <b>silver.</b> After these four-and-twenty there came another one who was the chief of them all, and before whom, splendid as they were, the four-and-twenty paled like stars in daylight. [...] "Go to the king's palace," [...] said the Demon to that one, [...] "and deliver this message: The Tailor of Tailors, the Master of Masters, and One Greater than a King asks for his daughter to wife." ...|$|R
5000|$|Used {{to cover}} the church tabernacle, {{particularly}} in the Roman Catholic tradition but in some others as well, when the Eucharist is actually stored in it. The veil is used to remind worshipers that the (usually metal) tabernacle cabinet echoes the tabernacle tent of the Hebrew Scriptures, and it signals that the tabernacle is actually in use. It may be of any liturgical color, but is most often white (always appropriate for the Eucharist), <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> gold or <b>silver</b> (which may substitute for any liturgical color aside from violet), or the liturgical color of the day (red, green or violet). It may be simple, unadorned linen or silk, {{or it may be}} fringed or otherwise decorated. It is often designed to match the vestments of the celebrants.|$|R
60|$|Matteo and I {{went to the}} Countess. She had surpassed herself this night. Her {{dress was}} of <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver,</b> shimmering and sparkling. In her hair were {{diamonds}} shining like fireflies in the night; her arms, her neck, her fingers glittered with costly gems. I {{had never seen her}} look so beautiful, nor so magnificent. Let them say what they liked, Checco and Matteo and the rest of them, but she was born to be a queen. How strange that this offspring of the rough Condottiere and the lewd woman should have a majesty such as one imagines of a mighty empress descended from countless kings.|$|E
60|$|That {{night they}} took up their inn in Melton Mowbray, in Leicestershire, {{and the next}} night they lodged at Kettering, in Northamptonshire; and the next at Bedford Town; and the next at St. Albans, in Hertfordshire. This place they left {{not long after the}} middle of the night, and {{traveling}} fast through the tender dawning of the summer day, when the dews lay shining on the meadows and faint mists hung in the dales, when the birds sang their sweetest and the cobwebs beneath the hedges glimmered like fairy <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver,</b> they came at last to the towers and walls of famous London Town, while the morn was still young and all golden toward the east.|$|E
60|$|So {{the king}} and his {{minister}} disguised themselves as foreign merchants, and went that evening to the palace where the young man lived. A servant dressed in clothes of gold and silver cloth stood at the door, and called to them {{to come in and}} be made welcome. He led them in, and to a chamber lit with perfumed lamps of gold. Then six black slaves took them in charge and led them to a bath of white marble. They were bathed in perfumed water and dried with towels of fine linen. When they came forth they were clad in clothes of <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver,</b> stiff with gold and jewels. Then twelve handsome white slaves led them through a vast and splendid hall to a banqueting-room.|$|E
60|$|He led the {{way down}} a long pathway between the trees, and Selim followed. By-and-by, far away, they saw the light of torches; and {{when they came to}} what they saw, lo and behold! there was the sea-shore, and a boat with four-and-twenty oarsmen, each dressed in <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> gold and <b>silver</b> more splendidly than a prince. And there were four-and-twenty black slaves, {{carrying}} each a torch of spice-wood, so that all the air was filled with sweet smells. The old man {{led the way}}, and Selim, following, entered the boat; and there was a seat for him made soft with satin cushions embroidered with gold and precious stones and stuffed with down, and Selim wondered whether he was not dreaming.|$|R
50|$|The Anglo-Catholic {{manual of}} rites and ceremonies Ritual Notes {{described}} tablernacles as generally {{made of wood}} (they could however be <b>of</b> gold, <b>silver</b> or even iron; if of iron this should be enclosed in gilt-wood, wrought metal or carved stone). If the material be metal {{there should be an}} inner lining of poplar or cedar wood and in any case a lining also of white silk or <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> gold or <b>silver.</b> The tabernacle should be securely fixed to the altar or gradine, but away from the wall so that the conopaeum (a veil used to cover it when it contains the blessed sacrament) can completely surround it. The veil may be white or varying in liturgical colour. There may be a second tabernacle but not more in the same church but if so only one should be used at any time. A lamp should remain lit nearby when the tabernacle is in use.|$|R
5000|$|The {{excess of}} apparel and the superfluity of {{unnecessary}} foreign wares thereto belonging now of late years is grown by sufferance {{to such an}} extremity that the manifest decay of the whole realm generally is like to follow (by bringing into the realm such superfluities <b>of</b> silks, <b>cloths</b> <b>of</b> gold, <b>silver,</b> and other most vain devices of so great cost for the quantity thereof as of necessity the moneys and treasure of the realm is and must be yearly conveyed {{out of the same}} to answer the said excess) but also particularly the wasting and undoing of a great number of young gentlemen, otherwise serviceable, and others seeking by show of apparel to be esteemed as gentlemen, who, allured by the vain show of those things, do not only consume themselves, their goods, and lands which their parents left unto them, but also run into such debts and shifts as they cannot live out of danger of laws without attempting unlawful acts, whereby they are not any ways serviceable to their country as otherwise they might be Statute issued at Greenwich, 15 June 1574, by order of Elizabeth I ...|$|R
60|$|The smoking haunch {{now stood}} upon the table; a napkin, white as snow, was, with due reverence, tucked under the chin of the Abbot by the Refectioner; and nought was wanting to {{commence}} the repast, save {{the presence of}} Sir Piercie Shafton, who at length appeared, glittering like the sun, in a carnation-velvet doublet, slashed and puffed out with <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver,</b> his hat of the newest block, surrounded by a hatband of goldsmith's work, while around his neck he wore a collar of gold, set with rubies and topazes so rich, that it vindicated his anxiety {{for the safety of}} his baggage from being founded upon his love of mere finery. This gorgeous collar or chain, resembling those worn by the knights of the highest orders of chivalry, fell down on his breast, and terminated in a medallion.|$|E
6000|$|The {{hatred of}} the Jews moved Herod Agrippa to put to death James the son of Zebedee, the first Apostle to drink of his Master's Cup; and he would {{likewise}} have slain Peter, had not the Angel delivered that Saint out of prison, in answer to the prayers of the Church. The pride of Herod {{had come to a}} height. He celebrated games at Cæsarea in honour of the emperor, and in the midst came forth in a robe of <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver,</b> to give audience to an embassy from Tyre and Zidon. At his speech, the people shouted, [...] "It is the voice of a god, not the voice of a man!" [...] But while Herod listened and took the glory to himself, he felt a deadly stroke, which made him cry, [...] "Your god is dying!" [...] and in five days he was dead. His son, Agrippa, was too young to take the government, and a Roman procurator was appointed.|$|E
6000|$|Clorinda {{took off}} her {{beautiful}} helmet, and her surcoat of <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> <b>silver,</b> and laid aside all her haughty arms, and dressed herself (hapless omen!) in black armour without polish, the better to conceal herself from the enemy. Her faithful servant, the good old eunuch Arsetes, who had attended her from infancy, and was now following her {{about as well as}} he could with his accustomed zeal, anxiously noticed what she was doing, and guessing it was for some desperate enterprise, entreated her, by his white hairs and all the love he had shewn her, to give it up. Finding his prayers to no purpose, he requested with great emotion that she would give ear to certain matters in her family history, which he at length felt it his duty to disclose. [...] "It would then," [...] he said, [...] "be for herself to judge, whether she would persist in the enterprise or renounce it." [...] Clorinda, at this, looked at the good man, and listened with attention.|$|E
6000|$|... "To hear is to obey," [...] {{said the}} Genie. As he spoke he smote his hands together, and {{instantly}} there appeared twenty musicians, dressed in <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> gold and <b>silver.</b> With them they brought hautboys and fiddles, big and little, and flageolets and drums and horns, {{and this and}} that to make music with. Again the Genie smote his hands together, and instantly there appeared fifty servants dressed in silks and satins and spangled with jewels, who began to spread a table with fine linen embroidered with gold, and to set plates <b>of</b> gold and <b>silver</b> upon it. The Genie smote his hands together a third time, and in answer there came six servants. They led Jacob Stuck into another room, where there was a bath of musk and rose-water. They bathed him in the bath and dressed him in clothes like an emperor, and when he came out again his face shone, and he was as handsome as a picture.|$|R
60|$|The Fleming gave {{orders to}} the servant, and they speedily had a snow-white <b>cloth</b> <b>of</b> the finest damask on the table, and placed on it a service <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> dishes.|$|R
