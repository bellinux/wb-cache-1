50|$|Venetian plaster is a {{wall and}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>finish</b> {{consisting}} of plaster mixed with marble dust, applied with a spatula or trowel in thin, multiple layers, which are then burnished to create a smooth surface with the illusion of depth and texture. Venetian plaster techniques include marmorino, scagliola, and sgraffito. When left un-burnished, Venetian plaster has a matte finish that is rough and stone-like to the touch. Un-burnished Venetian plaster is also very brittle and damages rather easily.|$|E

40|$|This Digest {{attempts}} to outline the principles involved in approaching {{the problem of}} dripping in curling rinks, and to discuss some of the methods {{that might lead to}} a solution. The analysis suggests that some means of introducing heat into the building is probably the most generally applicable and effective condensation control, particularly in the colder areas in Canada. In conjunction with heating, a roof deck having some thermal insulation value should be used for reasons of heat economy and to provide maximum ceiling surface temperatures. Ceiling finishes having water- absorbing characteristics offer considerable advantages over finishes incapable of taking up moisture. Wood roof decking is an ideal <b>ceiling</b> <b>finish</b> as it not only provides thermal insulation but is also capable of absorbing water.

5000|$|A tin {{ceiling is}} an {{architectural}} element, {{consisting of a}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>finished</b> with plates of tin with designs pressed into them, that was very popular in Victorian buildings in North America in the late 19th and early 20th century. They were also popular in Australia where they were commonly known as pressed metal ceilings or Wunderlich ceilings (after the main Australian manufacturer Wunderlich). They were also used in South Africa.|$|R
50|$|The wall or <b>ceiling</b> <b>finishing</b> {{process begins}} with wood laths. These are narrow strips of wood, or split boards, nailed {{horizontally}} across the wall studs or ceiling joists. Each wall frame {{is covered in}} lath, tacked at the studs. The lath is typically about one inch (2.5 cm) wide by four feet (1.22 meters) long by 1/4 in thick. Each horizontal course of lath is spaced about 3/8 in away from its neighboring courses.|$|R

Between the passenger area and the baggage room is the original ticket office containing the large bay window.|$|R
50|$|The Steiner {{tunnel test}} {{is a widely}} used method of testing {{building}} interior wall and <b>ceiling</b> <b>finishes</b> {{for their ability to}} support and propagate fire, and for their tendency to emit smoke. The test was developed in 1944 by Al Steiner of Underwriters Laboratories, and has been incorporated as a reference into North American standards for materials testing as tests ASTME84, NFPA255, UL723 and ULCS102. These standards are in widespread use for the regulation and selection of materials for interior building construction throughout North America.|$|R
50|$|Engineered {{components}} {{are commonly used}} to form floor, ceiling and roof structures in place of solid wood. I-joists (closed-web trusses) are often made from laminated woods, most often chipped poplar wood, in panels as thin as 1 cm, glued between horizontally laminated members of less than 4 cm by 4 cm (two-by-twos), to span distances {{of as much as}} 9 m. Open web trussed joists and rafters are often formed of 4 cm by 9 cm (two-by-four) wood members to provide support for floors, roofing systems and <b>ceiling</b> <b>finishes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Morrisville Christian Church, {{also known}} as Morrisville Church of Christ, is a {{historic}} church located at Morrisville, Wake County, North Carolina. It was built in 1872-1873, and is a one-story, three-bay by four bay, vernacular front-gable church. It has a projecting front gable and prominent three-stage corner bell tower, which contains the main entrance, protected by a front-gabled portico. The church retains its original wood flooring, wall and <b>ceiling</b> <b>finishes,</b> and floor plan. The United Church of Christ sold the building to the Town of Morrisville in 1976 and it houses a community center.|$|R
50|$|Wiring and piping {{installed}} behind traditional plaster or wallboard ceilings {{is extremely}} difficult to modify once the <b>finished</b> <b>ceiling</b> is in place. Wires must either be fished through hollow spaces in the walls behind the <b>finished</b> <b>ceiling,</b> or the ceiling must be demolished in order for wiring or piping changes to be made.|$|R
50|$|Inside, the harmoniously {{designed}} nave has an open roof trussed <b>ceiling,</b> <b>finished</b> {{with white}} sheeting, and whitewashed walls. Three old bricks {{from the mother}} church in Bryndum are built into {{the wall behind the}} pulpit. The floor is laid with red tiles. A white altar table of pine stands beside the east wall. The font takes the form of an intersected cylinder consisting of four blocks of Bornholm granite. Seen from above, the blocks form a cross. The pulpit, which resembles a normal speaking podium, rises only slightly above the floor. Like the altar, the pulpit and the pews are made of pine.|$|R

40|$|The {{vibrational}} {{characteristics of}} two specimens (FG board and FG plus CRC board), which are selected for ceiling materials in a concert hall, were measured. The vibration was generated through an omni-loudspeaker and an impact hammer, measuring the acceleration levels at the two-pipe crossed {{position on the}} reflectors. Results indicate that FG board shows higher vibration level than FG plus CRC board. In addition, impact hammer and onmi-loudspeaker show similar results in vibration responses: From the vibration acceleration levels at midpoint of the reflectors, the frequency band of the first mode for FG plus CRC board is lower than FG board. The results {{can be used for}} designing the <b>ceiling</b> <b>finishing</b> of concert halls...|$|R
50|$|The {{verandah}} ceilings to {{the upper}} level are raked, with timber boarding with exposed eaves rafters; the western and eastern ends of the <b>ceilings</b> are <b>finished</b> with triangular panels with vertical battens. The verandahs have ripple iron ceilings to the ground floor.|$|R
50|$|The edifice's {{interior}} {{has been}} almost completely stripped of all wall and <b>ceiling</b> <b>finishes,</b> wiring, trim, cabinetry, and fixtures. Some lath-and-plaster and interior trim remain, but the ceilings and walls have been stripped down to the wooden studs. The first-floor schoolroom was converted into a large gathering area and basketball court, resulting in the original ceiling being removed and the rafters being exposed. Some of the original tongue-and-groove maple flooring still remains in this room. The interior stairway that originally allowed access between the schoolroom and the basement was later rendered unusable when the schoolroom floor was extended over it to allow more for playing basketball; also, a loft was constructed over the bathrooms. Two windows were added {{on either side of}} an existing attic vent to provide additional light.|$|R
50|$|In {{determining}} the specific {{magnitude of the}} factors, more deterministic loads (like dead loads, {{the weight of the}} structure and permanent attachments like walls, floor treatments, <b>ceiling</b> <b>finishes)</b> are given lower factors (for example 1.4) than highly variable loads like earthquake, wind, or live (occupancy) loads (1.6). Impact loads are typically given higher factors still (say 2.0) in order to account for both their unpredictable magnitudes and the dynamic nature of the loading vs. the static nature of most models. While arguably not philosophically superior to permissible or allowable stress design, it does have the potential to produce a more consistently designed structure as each element is intended to have the same probability of failure. In practical terms this normally results in a more efficient structure, and as such, {{it can be argued that}} LSD is superior from a practical engineering viewpoint.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{is divided into}} two spaces. The front space houses the chapel, whose walls and <b>ceiling</b> are <b>finished</b> in varnished tongue-and-groove boards. The rear of the building is unfinished, and has always served as an equipment storage area; it is accessed via the sliding door on the south, and via an inside door.|$|R
50|$|On the interior, {{the three}} houses feature 2,000 {{square feet of}} living space, {{similarly}} arranged in all three.

50|$|The {{interior}} of the building is an open hall with a small separated kitchen area in the southwest corner. The <b>ceiling</b> is <b>finished</b> in tin, a replacement (at unknown date) for the original plaster ceiling. The floor is narrow hardwood, and the walls are lined with beadboard wainscoting. There is a raised platform in the northeast corner, which once held a wood stove.|$|R
25|$|Between 2002 and 2003, the {{courthouse}} underwent a major restoration that involved, not only electrical, mechanical and plumbing improvements {{as well as}} necessary accessibility enhancements such as the installation of an elevator, but also the correction of many architecturally insensitive modifications undergone previously. These included restoring the balcony and original furnishings in the courtroom and faux wood and metal <b>ceiling</b> <b>finishes</b> throughout the building. Exterior improvements included repairs to doors, windows and masonry, a new metal shingle roof, sheet metal repairs to cornices, and renovation of the clock tower. These renovations were performed {{at a cost of}} $2.8 million supported by a THC grant of $2.3 million with the remainder supported by local funding. The grant was administered as part of the THC's Texas Historic Courthouse Preservation Program, created to support counties preserve their current and former historic courthouses after the state's historic courthouses were included in the 1998 listing of most endangered historic places by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.|$|R
