5|$|Although <b>condoms</b> {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} sexual transmission of HIV, several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing <b>condoms,</b> and <b>condoms</b> are not typically available at bars {{and other social}} locations where {{they could have a}} significant impact on HIV prevention. Many people oppose <b>condoms</b> because they believe that <b>condoms</b> make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using <b>condoms</b> more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E
5|$|Globally, <b>condoms</b> are {{the most}} common method of birth control. Male <b>condoms</b> are put on a man's erect penis and {{physically}} block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner. Modern <b>condoms</b> are most often made from latex, but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane, or lamb's intestine. Female <b>condoms</b> are also available, most often made of nitrile, latex or polyurethane. Male <b>condoms</b> have the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use, and have few adverse effects. Making <b>condoms</b> available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual activity or its frequency. In Japan about 80% of couples who are using birth control use <b>condoms,</b> while in Germany this number is about 25%, and in the United States it is 18%.|$|E

The current study integrated past research by evaluating these factors in a large, ethnically diverse university sample {{of women and}} men (N = 665). The role of gender on <b>condom</b> use and sexuality variables was assessed across ethnic groups. Hierarchical linear regressions were then calculated to explain levels of <b>condom</b> use selfefficacy using the hypothesized sexual predictors in nonvirgin, sexually active, and recent <b>condom</b> use subsamples. Predictors explained 18 – 45 % of variance in <b>condom</b> use self-efficacy. Findings suggest that a few key variables accounted for the majority of variance in <b>condom</b> use self-efficacy: <b>condom</b> use attitudes, <b>condom</b> use barriers, satisfaction with sexual communication, anticipated number of sexual partners, one-time sexual encounters, and ethnic identity.

Although <b>condoms</b> had become commonplace in the 1930s, feminists in the movement felt that birth control should be the woman's prerogative, and they continued to push for development of a contraceptive that was under the woman's control, a campaign which ultimately led to the birth control pill decades later. To increase the availability of high-quality contraceptives, birth control advocates established the Holland–Rantos company to manufacture contraceptives– primarily diaphragms, which were Sanger's recommended method. By the 1930s, the diaphragm with spermicidal jelly had become the most commonly prescribed form of contraception; in 1938, female contraceptives accounted for 85 percent of annual contraceptive sales.|$|E

Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women.

40|$|Introduction: Oral {{pre-exposure}} prophylaxis (PrEP) is a promising new prevention approach for those {{most at risk}} of HIV infection. However, there are concerns that behavioural disinhibition, specifically reductions in <b>condom</b> use, might limit PrEP’s protective effect. This study uses the case of female sex workers (FSWs) in Johannesburg, South Africa, to assess whether decreased levels of <b>condom</b> use following the introduction of PrEP may limit HIV risk reduction. Methods: We developed a static model of HIV risk and compared HIV-risk estimates {{before and after the}} introduction of PrEP to determine the maximum tolerated reductions in <b>condom</b> use with regular partners and clients for HIV risk not to change. The model incorporated the effects of increased STI exposure owing to decreased <b>condom</b> use. Noting that <b>condom</b> use with regular partners is generally low, we also estimated the change in <b>condom</b> use tolerated with clients only, to still achieve 50 and 90 % risk reduction on PrEP. The model was parameterized using data from Hillbrow, Johannesburg. Sensitivity analyses were performed to ascertain the robustness of our results. Results: Reductions in <b>condom</b> use could be tolerated by FSWs with lower baseline <b>condom</b> use (65 %). For scenarios where 75 % PrEP effectiveness is attained, 50 % HIV-risk reduction on PrEP would be possible even with 100 % reduction in <b>condom</b> use from consistent <b>condom</b> use as high as 70 % with clients. Increased exposure to STIs through reductions in <b>condom</b> use had limited effect on the reductions in <b>condom</b> use tolerated for HIV risk not to increase on PrEP. Conclusions: PrEP is likely to be of benefit in reducing HIV risk, even if reductions in <b>condom</b> use do occur. Efforts to promote consistent <b>condom</b> use will be critical for FSWs with high initial levels of <b>condom</b> use, but with challenges in adhering to PrEP...|$|R

40|$|Background : Feminization of the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} {{has been}} a prominent phenomenon in sub-Saharan Africa. Inconsistent <b>condom</b> use among young people {{is one of the}} major risk factors in the continued propagation of the epidemic. Therefore, it is of importance to increase knowledge of gender aspects of <b>condom</b> use among young people. Objective : To investigate whether gender differences regarding individual and social factors determine the association between <b>condom</b> efficacy and inconsistent <b>condom</b> use with a new sex partner, among Ugandan university students. Design : In 2010, 1954 Ugandan students participated in a cross-sectional survey, conducted at Mbarara University of Science and Technology in southwestern Uganda. A self-administered questionnaire assessed socio-demographic factors, alcohol consumption, sexual behaviors (including <b>condom</b> use and <b>condom</b> efficacy), and peer norms. The data were stratified by sex and examined by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results : A total of 1, 179 (60. 3 %) students reported having had their sexual debut. Of these, 231 (37. 4 %) males and 209 (49. 2 %) females reported inconsistent <b>condom</b> use with a new sex partner. Students with low <b>condom</b> efficacy had a higher risk of inconsistent <b>condom</b> use with a new sex partner, even after adjusting for the potential confounders. A synergistic effect was observed between being a female and low <b>condom</b> efficacy with inconsistent <b>condom</b> use. Conclusion : The association between inconsistent <b>condom</b> use and low <b>condom</b> efficacy was found among both males and females, but females were found to be at a higher risk of inconsistent <b>condom</b> use compared to their male counterparts. Therefore, gender power relations should be addressed in policies and interventions aiming at increasing <b>condom</b> use among young people in sub-Saharan settings. Programs could be designed with intervention strategies that focus on interactive and participatory educational activities and youth-friendly counseling of young people, which in turn may improve their interpersonal communication and <b>condom</b> negotiation skills with their partners...|$|R

One-hundred and eleven sexually active undergraduate participants (92 female, and 19 male) responded to measures designed to test these constructs. Attitudes toward <b>condom</b> use explained a large proportion of the variance accounted for in <b>condom</b> use. Theory of reasoned action variables (attitude, subjective norm, and intentions), perceived behavioural control over <b>condom</b> use, and an interaction of the public performance factor (of the Self-Monitoring Scale) x past <b>condom</b> use variability each obtained support as predictors of actual <b>condom</b> use. A trend toward greater discrepancy between attitudes toward <b>condom</b> use and <b>condom</b> use behaviour was observed for participants who reported greater variability in their past <b>condom</b> use, and those who scored higher on the public performance sub-scale of the Self Monitoring scale. Finally, path analysis supported the theory of planned behaviour as a model to predict <b>condom</b> use over the revised model which included the public performance x variability interaction.
