Simultaneous distillation-extraction apparatus was modified by Muchalal from the basic Likens-Nickerson's design. Steam distillation and benzena as an extraction solvent {{was used in}} this system. The isolation was continuously carried out for 3 hours which maximum water temperature In the Liebig condenser was 8 °C.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2000 The global {{distribution}} of {{persistent organic pollutants}} has initiated considerable effort towards understanding long range atmospheric transport and partitioning of these potentially damaging compounds. Apparent latitude dependent concentration gradients of organic pollutants in otherwise pristine environments {{has given rise to}} a global fractionation model, coined the <b>cold</b> <b>finger</b> effect. According to the <b>cold</b> <b>finger</b> theory, semi-volatile persistent organic pollutant will show a preference for partitioning from the atmosphere to the ground and vegetation at northern latitudes. Here we present a study of hexachlorobenzene in spruce needle samples across Alaska, which offers a large range of climates, from its southern coastal rain forests to the northern arctic. The large variation in climate across Alaska should result in a measurable latitude dependent concentration gradient for HCB, if the <b>cold</b> <b>finger</b> effect is being realized. Spruce needle samples were extracted, cleaned, and analyzed by GC/MS. According to principle component regression analysis, HCB concentrations in all the spruce needle samples across Alaska show a strong positive correlation with lipid content of the needles. The HCB concentrations also show two distinct latitude trends. The spruce needle samples taken from the coast to approximately 63 ° north show relatively high HCB concentrations and a possible negative correlation with latitude. The samples between 63 ° and 68 ° north show a definite positive correlation between HCB concentration and latitude, which is consistent with the <b>cold</b> <b>finger</b> effect...|$|R

Important parameters affecting wax deposition such as experimental duration, speed of rotation, <b>cold</b> <b>finger</b> temperature, and inhibitor concentration were investigated.

These results demonstrate that <b>cold</b> <b>finger</b> temperature and experimental duration could be the main factors affecting wax deposit formation. The minimum amount of wax deposit obtained could reduce the chances of blocked pipelines; however, crude oil production increased.
