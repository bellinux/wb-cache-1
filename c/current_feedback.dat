50|$|The <b>current</b> <b>feedback</b> {{operational}} amplifier (CFOA or CFA) {{is a type}} of electronic amplifier whose inverting input is sensitive to current, rather than to voltage as in a conventional voltage-feedback {{operational amplifier}} (VFA). The CFA was invented by David Nelson at Comlinear Corporation, and first sold in 1982 as a hybrid amplifier, the CLC103. An early patent covering a CFA is , David Nelson and Kenneth Saller (filed in 1983). The integrated circuit CFAs were introduced in 1987 by both Comlinear and Elantec (designer Bill Gross). They are usually produced with the same pin arrangements as VFAs, allowing the two types to be interchanged without rewiring when the circuit design allows. In simple configurations, such as linear amplifiers, a CFA can be used in place of a VFA with no circuit modifications, but in other cases, such as integrators, a different circuit design is required. The classic four-resistor differential amplifier configuration also works with a CFA, but the common-mode rejection ratio is poorer than that from a VFA.|$|E

5000|$|Loudspeakers {{present a}} {{reactive}} load to an amplifier (capacitance, inductance and resistance). This impedance may vary in value with signal frequency and amplitude. This variable loading affects the amplifier's performance both because the amplifier has nonzero output impedance (it cannot keep its output voltage perfectly constant when the speaker load varies) {{and because the}} phase of the speaker load can change the stability margin of the amplifier. The influence of the speaker impedance is different between tube amplifiers and transistor amplifiers. The reason is that tube amplifiers normally use output transformers, and cannot use much negative feedback due to phase problems in transformer circuits. Notable exceptions are various [...] "OTL" [...] (output-transformerless) tube amplifiers, pioneered by Julius Futterman in the 1950s, or somewhat rarer tube amplifiers that replace the impedance matching transformer with additional (often, though not necessarily, transistorized) circuitry in order to eliminate parasitics and musically unrelated magnetic distortions.

50|$|At resting potential, {{both the}} voltage gated sodium and {{potassium}} channels are closed {{but as the}} cell membrane becomes depolarized the voltage gated sodium channels begin to open up and the neuron begins to depolarize, creating a <b>current</b> <b>feedback</b> loop known as the Hodgkin cycle. However, potassium ions naturally {{move out of the}} cell and if the original depolarization event was not significant enough then the neuron does not generate an action potential. If all the sodium channels are open, however, then the neuron becomes ten times more permeable to sodium than potassium, quickly depolarizing the cell to a peak of +40 mV. At this level the sodium channels begin to close and voltage gated potassium channels begin to open. This combination of closed sodium channels and open potassium channels leads to the neuron re-polarizing and becoming negative again. The neuron continues to re-polarize until the cell reaches ~ -75 mV, which is the equilibrium potential of potassium ions. This is {{the point at which the}} neuron is hyperpolarized, between -70 mV and -75 mV. After hyperpolarization the potassium channels close and the natural permeability of the neuron to sodium and potassium allows the neuron to return to its resting potential of -70 mV. During the refractory period, which is after hyper-polarization but before the neuron has returned to its resting potential the neuron is capable of triggering an action potential due to the sodium channels ability to be opened, however, because the neuron is more negative it becomes more difficult to reach the action potential threshold.|$|E

A detailed theoret-ical analysis, based on the concept of harmonic impedance, estab-lishes the suitability of inductor <b>current</b> <b>feedback</b> versus output <b>current</b> <b>feedback</b> with respect to inverter power quality. Experi-mental results, obtained from a purpose-built 500 -W, three-level, half-bridge inverter with an – – output filter, verify the ef-ficacy of inductor current as the feedback variable, yielding an output current total harmonic distortion (THD) some 29 % lower than that achieved using output <b>current</b> <b>feedback.</b> A feed-forward grid voltage disturbance rejection scheme is proposed as a means to further reduce the level of low-order current harmonic distortion.
