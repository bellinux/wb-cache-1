5|$|Apoptosis is a {{controlled}} {{process in which}} the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of <b>caspase</b> activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.|$|E
5|$|HTT is {{expressed}} in all mammalian cells. The highest concentrations {{are found in the}} brain and testes, with moderate amounts in the liver, heart, and lungs. The function of HTT in humans is unclear. It interacts with proteins which are involved in transcription, cell signaling, and intracellular transporting. In animals genetically modified to exhibit HD, several functions of HTT have been found. In these animals, HTT is important for embryonic development, as its absence is related to embryonic death. <b>Caspase,</b> an enzyme which plays a role in catalyzing apoptosis, is thought to be activated by the mutated gene through damaging the ubiquitin-protease system. It also acts as an anti-apoptotic agent preventing programmed cell death and controls the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein which protects neurons and regulates their creation during neurogenesis. HTT also facilitates vesicular transport and synaptic transmission and controls neuronal gene transcription. If the expression of HTT is increased and more HTT produced, brain cell survival is improved and the effects of mHTT are reduced, whereas when the expression of HTT is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more typical of the presence of mHTT. In humans the disruption of the normal gene does not cause the disease. It is thought that the disease is not caused by inadequate production of HTT, but by a gain of toxic function of mHTT.|$|E
25|$|Researchers decided {{upon the}} {{nomenclature}} of the <b>caspase</b> in 1996. In many instances, a particular <b>caspase</b> {{had been identified}} simultaneously {{by more than one}} laboratory, who would each give the protein a different name. For example, <b>caspase</b> 3 was variously known as CPP32, apopain and Yama. Caspases, therefore, were numbered in the order in which they were identified. ICE was, therefore, renamed as <b>caspase</b> 1. ICE was the first mammalian <b>caspase</b> to be characterised because of its similarity to the nematode death gene ced-3, but it appears that the principal role of this enzyme is to mediate inflammation rather than cell death.|$|E
30|$|<b>Caspases</b> {{are found}} {{practically}} in all organisms from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. At least 12 of the <b>caspases</b> {{have been identified}} (<b>caspases</b> 1 through 10, 13, and 14). <b>Caspases</b> share similarities in amino acid sequence, structure, and substrate specificity, and are subdivided in to two subfamilies based on their functionality: <b>caspases</b> involved in inflammation (<b>caspases</b> 1, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, and 14) and apoptosis-related <b>caspases</b> (<b>caspases</b> 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10). Among the identified <b>caspases,</b> activation of caspase- 3 is a key event integrating upstream signals into final execution of cell death [4].|$|R
25|$|Initiator <b>caspases</b> auto-proteolytically cleave whereas Executioner <b>caspases</b> are cleaved by {{initiator}} <b>caspases.</b> This hierarchy allows an amplifying {{chain reaction}} or cascade for degrading cellular components, during controlled cell death.|$|R

25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown {{substantial}} interplay between the apoptosis and necroptosis pathways. At multiple stages of their respective signalling cascades, the two pathways can regulate each other. The best characterized example of this co-regulation {{is the ability of}} <b>caspase</b> 8 to inhibit the formation of the necrosome by cleaving RIPK1. Conversely, <b>caspase</b> 8 inhibition of necroptosis can be bypassed by the necroptotic machinery through the anti-apoptotic protein cFLIP which inactivates <b>caspase</b> 8 through formation of a heterodimer.|$|E
25|$|Apoptotic {{cell death}} is {{characterized}} by a proteolytic <b>caspase</b> cascade that emanates from either an extrinsic or an intrinsic pathway. The extrinsic pathway is initiated by membrane bound death receptors, leading to activation of <b>caspase</b> 8, whereas the intrinsic pathway is triggered by DNA damaging drugs and UV radiation, leading to mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent activation of <b>caspase</b> 9. PLSCRs are supposed {{to play an important role}} in both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic responses that are linked to each other via the activation of <b>caspase</b> 8. Activated <b>caspase</b> 8 causes the cleavage of the amino terminal portion of the cytosolic protein Bid to generate t-Bid that is translocated into mitochondria during apoptosis. hPLSCR1 and its mitochondrial counterpart hPLSCR3 are phosphorylated by PKCδ during PKC-δ-induced apoptosis. While the consequence of hPLSCR1 phosphorylation and its mechanism of action during cellular apoptotic response remain unclear, phosphorylated hPLSCR3 is thought to facilitate mitochondrial targeting of t-Bid that is an essential requirement in <b>caspase</b> 8-mediated apoptosis. The active t-Bid fragment is shown to localize to mitochondria through a positive interaction with cardiolipin. This activated t-Bid induces activation of Bax and Bak proteins to form cytochrome c channels that facilitate the release of cytochrome c during apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Intrinsic apoptopic pathway: During {{times of}} {{cellular}} stress, mitochondrial cytochrome c is {{released into the}} cytosol. This molecule binds an adaptor protein (APAF-1), which recruits initiator Caspase-9 (via CARD-CARD interactions). This leads {{to the formation of}} a <b>Caspase</b> activating multiprotein complex called the Apoptosome. Once activated, initiator caspases such as <b>Caspase</b> 9 will cleave and activate other executioner caspases. This leads to degradation of cellular components for apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Once {{initiator}} <b>caspases</b> are activated, {{they produce}} a chain reaction, activating several other executioner <b>caspases.</b> Executioner <b>caspases</b> degrade over 600 cellular components {{in order to}} induce the morphological changes for apoptosis.|$|R
50|$|<b>Caspases</b> (cysteine-aspartic acid proteases) cleave at very {{specific}} amino acid residues. There {{are two types}} of caspases: initiators and effectors. Initiator <b>caspases</b> cleave inactive forms of effector <b>caspases.</b> This activates the effectors that in turn cleave other proteins resulting in apoptotic initiation.|$|R
40|$|Decision-making {{between life}} and death {{is one of the most}} {{important}} tasks of cells to maintain their genetic integrity. While the surviving mechanism is driven by Beclin 1 -dependent autophagy, the suicide processes are controlled by caspases-mediated apoptosis. Interestingly, both these processes share regulators such as Bcl 2 and influence each other through feedback loops. The physiological relevance of the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis is still unclear. To gain system level insights, we have developed a mathematical model of the autophagy–apoptosis crosstalk. Our analysis reveals that a combination of Bcl 2 -dependent regulation and feedback loops between Beclin 1 and <b>caspases</b> robustly enforces a sequential activation of cellular responses depending upon the intensity and duration of stress levels. The amplifying loops for <b>caspases</b> activation involving Beclin 1 -dependent inhibition of <b>caspases</b> and cleavage of Beclin 1 by <b>caspases</b> (Beclin 1 <b>caspases</b> Beclin 1; <b>caspases</b> - cleaved Beclin 1 - <b>caspases)</b> not only make the system bistable but also help to switch off autophagy at high stress levels. The presence of an additional positive feedback loop between Bcl 2 and <b>caspases</b> helps to maintain the <b>caspases</b> activation by making the switch irreversible.

25|$|Cell {{suicide is}} an {{effective}} means of stemming the spread of a pathogen throughout an organism. In apoptotic responses to infection, the contents of an infected cell (including the pathogen) are contained and engulfed by phagocytosis. Some pathogens, such as human cytomegalovirus, express <b>caspase</b> inhibitors that arrest the apoptotic machinery of the host cell. The caspase-independence of necroptosis allows the cell to bypass <b>caspase</b> activation, decreasing the time during which the pathogen can inhabit the cell.|$|E
25|$|In apoptosis, {{extrinsic}} signaling via cell surface receptors or intrinsic signaling by {{release of}} cytochrome c from mitochondria leads to <b>caspase</b> activation. Proteolytic {{degradation of the}} cell’s interior culminates with the packaging of the cell’s remains into apoptotic bodies, which are degraded and recycled by phagocytosis. Unlike in apoptosis, necrosis and necroptosis do not involve <b>caspase</b> activation. Necrotic cell death culminates in leakage of cell contents into the extracellular space, {{in contrast to the}} organized disposal of cellular contents into apoptotic bodies.|$|E
25|$|The {{characterization}} of the caspases allowed the development of <b>caspase</b> inhibitors, {{which can be used}} to determine whether a cellular process involves active caspases. Using these inhibitors it was discovered that cells can die while displaying a morphology similar to apoptosis without <b>caspase</b> activation. Later studies linked this phenomenon to the release of AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) from the mitochondria and its translocation into the nucleus mediated by its NLS (nuclear localization signal). Inside the mitochondria, AIF is anchored to the inner membrane. In order to be released, the protein is cleaved by a calcium-dependent calpain protease.|$|E
40|$|Apoptosis of retinal {{capillary}} cells begins {{early in}} dia-betes and likely {{contributes to the}} capillary obliteration that is an important feature of diabetic retinopathy. <b>Caspases</b> are proteolytic enzymes that are closely in-volved in the induction and execution phases of apopto-sis, but {{their role in the}} development of diabetic retinopathy has not been studied previously. Our study focused on the measurement of activities of multiple <b>caspases</b> in retinas of mice at different durations of diabetes.

25|$|H. Robert Horvitz {{initially}} {{established the}} importance of caspases in apoptosis {{and found that the}} ced-3 gene is required for the cell death that took place during the development of the nematode C. elegans. Horvitz and his colleague Junying Yuan found in 1993 that the protein encoded by the ced-3 gene is cysteine protease with similar properties to the mammalian interleukin-1-beta converting enzyme (ICE) (now known as <b>caspase</b> 1). At the time, ICE was the only known <b>caspase.</b> Other mammalian caspases were subsequently identified, in addition to caspases in organisms such as fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.|$|E
25|$|Death {{effector}} domain (DED) : allows protein–protein binding by homotypic interactions (DED-DED). <b>Caspase</b> proteases trigger apoptosis via proteolytic cascades.

25|$|These caspases {{have the}} ability to induce direct pyroptosis when {{lipopolysaccharide}} (LPS) molecules (found in the cell wall of gram negative bacteria) are found in the cytoplasm of the host cell. For example, <b>Caspase</b> 4 acts as a receptor and is proteolytically activated, without the need of an inflammasome complex or Caspase-1 activation.|$|E
5000|$|Metacaspases {{are members}} of the C14 class of {{cysteine}} proteases and thus related to <b>caspases,</b> orthocaspases and paracaspases. [...] The metacaspases are Arginine/Lysine-specific, in contrast to <b>caspases,</b> which are Aspartate-specific.|$|R
40|$|Resistance toward {{cytotoxic}} {{drugs is}} one of the primary causes for therapeutic failure in cancer therapy. DNA repair mechanisms as well as deficient <b>caspases</b> activation {{play a critical role in}} apoptosis resistance of tumor cells toward anticancer drug treatment. Here, we discovered that deficient <b>caspases</b> activation in apoptosis-resistant cancer cells depends on DNA-ligase IV and DNA-protein kinase (DNA-PK), playing crucial roles in the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which is the predominant pathway for DNA double-strand break repair (DNA-DSB-repair) in mammalian cells. DNA-PK(�/�) as well as DNA-ligase IV (�/�) cancer cells were apoptosis resistant and deficient in activation of caspase- 3, caspase- 9, and caspase- 8 and in cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase after doxorubicin treatment. Inhibition of NHEJ by knocking out DNA-PK or DNA-ligase IV restored <b>caspases</b> activation and apoptosis sensitivity after doxorubicin treatment. In addition, inhibition of <b>caspases</b> activation prevented doxorubicin-induced apoptosis but could not prevent doxorubicin-induced DNA damage, indicating that induction of DNA damage is independent of <b>caspases</b> activation. However, <b>caspases</b> activation depends on induction of DNA damage left unrepaired by NHEJ-DNA-DSB-repair. We conclude that DNA damage left unrepaired by DNA-ligase IV or DNA-PK might be the initiator for <b>caspases</b> activation by doxorubicin in cancer cells. Failure in <b>caspases</b> activation using doxorubicin depends on loss of DNA damage and is due to higher rates of NHEJ-DNA-DBS-repair...|$|R
40|$|The {{destruction}} of cellular targets during apoptosis {{is carried out}} by <b>caspases,</b> which are negatively regulated by the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP); however, death effector domain (DED) <b>caspases</b> of the extrinsic pathway are refractory to the IAP family.

25|$|HK2 is {{believed}} to maintain the mitochondrial membrane potential by keeping ADP levels high. It also prevents apoptosis in several ways: it reduces mitochondrial ROS levels, and it prevents apoptosis-causing protein Bax from creating a channel with VDAC.

25|$|A cancer cell can die {{in three}} ways: apoptosis, {{necrosis}} and autophagy. Excessive ROS can induce apoptosis through both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. In the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, ROS are generated by Fas ligand as an upstream event for Fas activation via phosphorylation, which {{is necessary for}} subsequent recruitment of Fas-associated protein with death domain and <b>caspase</b> 8 as well as apoptosis induction. In the intrinsic pathway, ROS function to facilitate cytochrome c release by activating pore-stabilizing proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) as well as inhibiting pore-destabilizing proteins (Bcl-2-associated X protein, Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer). The intrinsic pathway {{is also known as}} the <b>caspase</b> cascade and is induced through mitochondrial damage which triggers the release of cytochrome c. DNA damage, oxidative stress, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential lead to the release of the pro-apoptotic proteins mentioned above stimulating apoptosis. Mitochondrial damage is closely linked to apoptosis and since mitochondria are easily targeted there is potential for cancer therapy.|$|E

While survivin has been shown as mentioned above to bind to only the active forms of these <b>caspases,</b> it is likely here that survivin inhibits the active forms of the <b>caspases</b> resulting from cleaving and activating more of its own proforms.

25|$|Many viruses encode {{proteins}} that can inhibit apoptosis. Several viruses encode viral homologs of Bcl-2. These homologs can inhibit proapoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK, which {{are essential for}} the activation of apoptosis. Examples of viral Bcl-2 proteins include the Epstein-Barr virus BHRF1 protein and the adenovirus E1B 19K protein. Some viruses express <b>caspase</b> inhibitors that inhibit <b>caspase</b> activity and {{an example is the}} CrmA protein of cowpox viruses. Whilst a number of viruses can block the effects of TNF and Fas. For example, the M-T2 protein of myxoma viruses can bind TNF preventing it from binding the TNF receptor and inducing a response. Furthermore, many viruses express p53 inhibitors that can bind p53 and inhibit its transcriptional transactivation activity. As a consequence, p53 cannot induce apoptosis, since it cannot induce the expression of proapoptotic proteins. The adenovirus E1B-55K protein and the hepatitis B virus HBx protein are examples of viral {{proteins that}} can perform such a function.|$|E
25|$|Mitochondriate {{eukaryotic}} cells live poised {{between life}} and death, because mitochondria still retain their repertoire of molecules that can trigger cell suicide. It is not clear why apoptotic machinery is maintained in the extant unicellular organisms. This process has now been evolved to happen only when programmed. to cells (such as feedback from neighbors, stress or DNA damage), mitochondria release <b>caspase</b> activators that trigger the cell-death-inducing biochemical cascade.

The proapoptotic homodimers are required to make the mitochondrial membrane permeable {{for the release of}} <b>caspase</b> activators such as cytochrome c and SMAC.
