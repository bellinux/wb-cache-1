As such, the bird <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> common in its local habitat.|$|E
5|$|The {{house today}} appears an {{assemblage}} of several architectural styles popular during the Victorian era. While the overall design and air <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> Italianate, also present in the same entrance facade are examples of high Victorian Gothic, such as an Italianate seigneurial tower confused in design with a campanile tower. This tower complete with a glazed loggia is crowned by a French-style mansard roof with oversized chimneys masquerading as Renaissance ornament. The centrepiece of the same facade is a porte-cochère designed in a heavy neoclassical style.|$|E
5|$|By many general {{criteria}} of mutual intelligibility, the Continental Scandinavian languages {{could very well}} be considered dialects of a common Scandinavian language. However, because of several hundred years of sometimes quite intense rivalry between Denmark and Sweden, including a long series of wars from the 16th to 18th centuries, and the nationalist ideas that emerged during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the languages have separate orthographies, dictionaries, grammars, and regulatory bodies. Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are thus from a linguistic perspective more accurately described as a dialect continuum of Scandinavian (North Germanic), and some of the dialects, such as those on the border between Norway and Sweden, especially parts of Bohuslän, Dalsland, western Värmland, western Dalarna, Härjedalen, Jämtland and Scania, <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> intermediate dialects of the national standard languages.|$|E

5|$|Carl (Martin Sheen's character) {{represents}} {{the working class}} in the film: he is the union leader for the maintenance workers at Bluestar. He constantly attacks big business, money, mandatory drug screening, greedy manufacturers, and anything that he sees {{as a threat to}} his union. The conflict between Gekko's relentless pursuit of wealth and Carl Fox's leftward leanings form the basis of the film's subtext. This subtext <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> the concept of the two fathers battling for control over the morals of the son, a concept Stone had also used in Platoon. In Wall Street the hard-working Carl Fox and the cutthroat businessman Gordon Gekko represent the fathers. The producers of the film use Carl as their voice in the film, a voice of reason amid the creative destruction brought about by Gekko's unrestrained personal philosophy.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Ireland declared neutrality. There were a total of 56 Irish ships at {{the outbreak}} of World War II; 15 more were purchased or leased in the conflict, and 16 were lost. Up to then most Irish-registered ships had been flying the red ensign of the United Kingdom Merchant Navy. All were required by UK law to fly the Red Ensign, but some, such as the Wexford Steamship Company ships, had always travelled under the tricolour. With {{the outbreak of}} hostilities, choices were forced. The Irish government ordered all Irish ships to fly the tricolour. Some British ships were on the Irish register, such as the whalers which were Scottish-owned (Christian Salvesen Shipping) but Irish-registered in order {{to take advantage of the}} Irish whale quota. The six whale catchers and the two factory ships were pressed into British naval service, after their owners transferred them to the British registry. Some ships which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> British also choose the Tricolour. Kerrymore, which was registered as belonging to R McGowan of Tralee, was actually owned by Kelly Colliers of Belfast. Most of the crew had addresses in loyalist areas of Belfast. For six years they sailed under the tricolour.|$|E

5000|$|Despite its {{commonly}} being {{attributed to}} this book, {{it was not}} until his Principles of Biology of 1864 that Spencer coined the phrase [...] "survival of the fittest", which he would later apply to economics and biology. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>describe</b> <b>as</b> a key tenet of so-called Social Darwinism, though Spencer and his book were not an advocate thereof.|$|R

25|$|Early Internet forums <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> a web {{version of}} an {{electronic}} mailing list or newsgroup (such as exist on Usenet); allowing people to post messages and comment on other messages.

25|$|On {{election}} day, {{results for}} the party <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> mixed.

5000|$|He has {{a history}} of co-operating with the Moroccan {{government}} when they make crackdowns on the Salafi movement in the country and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>describe</b> <b>as</b> part of a trend of political quietism in Islam. He said during his trial, [...] "We are preachers, not revolutionaries. It is not our job to judge others, which is a prerogative of the Sultan and his delegates". At the same time, he has also <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> [...] "the most hard-line Salafist" [...] in this trend and is known as a supporter of al-Qaeda.|$|R
50|$|As {{with many}} of C. J. Cherryh's novels, this series <b>could</b> <b>be</b> best <b>described</b> <b>as</b> anthropological science fiction, {{focusing}} on the interface between our human customs and understandings and that of an alien race whose motivations, thoughts and even feelings are diametrically opposed to our own. Broadly speaking, the series <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> space opera, especially {{the second and third}} story arcs. It also contains elements of political thriller, with the complex racial and cultural interplay between humans and atevi, and between ship crew and colonist.|$|R
25|$|Distinctions may be {{made between}} {{particular}} kinds of names simply by using the suffix -onym, from the Greek ὄνομα (ónoma) 'name'.

25|$|However, {{after the}} Treaty of Maastricht, Parliament gained {{a much bigger}} role. Maastricht brought in the codecision procedure, which gave it equal {{legislative}} power with the Council on Community matters. Hence, with the greater powers of the supranational institutions and the operation of Qualified Majority Voting in the Council, the Community pillar <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> a far more federal method of decision making.|$|E
25|$|Something New is a {{political}} party in England, founded in October 2014. The party is primarily based {{on the concept of}} an open-source manifesto, which means that it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> a party of the radical centre, as it combines ideas from the left and right of politics. It could also be described as syncretic. As such, Something New has no fixed ideology and instead believes in evidence-based policy creation.|$|E
25|$|Other Jacobite {{recruits}} <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> adventurers– desperate men who saw {{the cause}} {{as a solution to}} their (usually financial) problems. Although small in number and varying from unemployed weavers looking for excitement to impoverished gentry like William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock who served Charles as a colonel and became a general after the Battle of Falkirk, they contributed significantly to the daring that brought the Jacobites a prospect of success in their campaigns. However, other such mercenaries often became spies and informers.|$|E
