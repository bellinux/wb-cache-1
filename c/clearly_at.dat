5|$|The known {{expansion}} {{rate of the}} Homunculus Nebula provides an unusual geometric method for measuring its distance. Assuming that the two lobes of the nebula are symmetrical, the projection of the nebula onto the sky depends on its distance. Values of 2,300, 2,250 and 2,300parsecs have been derived for the Homunculus, and Eta Carinae is <b>clearly</b> <b>at</b> the same distance.|$|E
25|$|In the old days, {{relaying}} moves required {{another person}} copying the moves {{of the players}} into a large board behind the players, which was then transmitted via radio or telegram. Advancements of camera allow for zooming <b>clearly</b> <b>at</b> the players' board, although relaying moves still {{had to be done}} manually. Recently, DGT chess board captures the piece movements and allows for moves to be relayed instantaneously, eliminating the need for manual relay, but due to price (around $3000 per board), it has been limited to only a few tournaments.|$|E
25|$|The objectivist poets were a loose-knit {{group of}} second-generation Modernists who {{emerged in the}} 1930s. They were mainly American and were {{influenced}} by, amongst others, Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams. The basic tenets of objectivist poetics as defined by Louis Zukofsky were to treat the poem as an object, and to emphasise sincerity, intelligence, and the poet's ability to look <b>clearly</b> <b>at</b> the world. While {{the name of the}} group is similar to Ayn Rand's school of philosophy, the two movements are not affiliated in any way, and are, in fact, radically different.|$|E

25|$|The cricket {{broadcasts}} {{take precedence}} over on-the-hour news bulletins, but not the Shipping Forecast, carried since its move to long wave in 1978 because that can be received <b>clearly</b> <b>at</b> sea. The station is the UK's national broadcaster in times of national emergency such as war, due to the wide coverage of the Droitwich signal: if all other radio stations were forced to close, it would carry on broadcasting. It has been claimed that the commanders of nuclear-armed submarines believing that Britain had suffered nuclear attack were required to check if they could still receive Radio 4 on 198 long wave, and if they could not they would open sealed orders that might authorise a retaliatory strike.|$|E
25|$|Monovision {{is the use}} of single-vision lenses (one {{focal point}} per lens) to focus an eye (typically the {{dominant}} one) for distance vision and the other for near work. The brain then learns to use this setup to see <b>clearly</b> <b>at</b> all distances. A technique called modified monovision uses multifocal lenses and also specializes one eye for distance and the other for near, thus gaining the benefits of both systems. Alternatively, a person may simply wear reading glasses over their distance contact lenses. Care is advised for persons with a previous history of strabismus and those with significant phorias, who are at risk of eye misalignment under monovision. Studies have shown no adverse effect to driving performance in adapted monovision contact lens wearers.|$|E
25|$|Though image {{intensification}} technology {{employed by}} different manufacturers varies, from the tactical {{point of view}} a night vision system is an optical device that enables vision at low light. The US government itself has recognized the fact that technology itself makes little difference as long as an operator can see <b>clearly</b> <b>at</b> night. Consequently, the United States bases export regulations not on the generations, but on a calculated factor called figure of merit (FOM). The method of FOM calculation {{and its implications for}} export are briefly described in a National Defense University document called “The NATO Response Force” authored by Jeffrey P. Bialos, the Executive Director of the Transatlantic Security and Industry Program at the Johns Hopkins University and Stuart L. Koehl, a Fellow at the Center for Transatlantic Relations of the same university.|$|E

25|$|The women deacons {{are also}} {{mentioned}} in a {{passage of the}} Council of Nicea in 325 which implies their hierarchal, consecrated or ordained status; then more <b>clearly</b> <b>at</b> the Council of Chalcedon of 451 which decreed that women should not be ordained deacons until they were 40 years old. The oldest ordination rite for deaconesses {{is found in the}} 5th-century Apostolic Constitutions. It describes the laying on of hands on the woman by the bishop with the calling down of the Holy Spirit for the ministry of the diaconate. A full version of the rite, with rubrics and prayers, has been found in the Barberini Codex of 780 AD. This liturgical manual provides an ordination rite for women as deacons which is virtually identical to the ordination rite for men as deacons. Other ancient manuscripts confirm the same rite. A careful study of the rite has persuaded most modern scholars that the rite was fully a sacrament in present-day terms.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, modernism in English {{remained}} {{in the role of}} an avant garde movement, depending on little presses and magazines and a small but dedicated readership. The key group to emerge during this time were the Objectivist poets, consisting of Louis Zukofsky, George Oppen, Charles Reznikoff, Carl Rakosi, Basil Bunting and Lorine Niedecker. The Objectivists were admirers of Stein, Pound and Williams and Pound actively promoted their work. Thanks to his influence, Zukofsky was asked to edit a special Objectivist issue of the Chicago-based journal Poetry in 1931 to launch the group. The basic tenets of Objectivist poetics were to treat the poem as an object and to emphasise sincerity, intelligence, and the poet's ability to look <b>clearly</b> <b>at</b> the world, and in this they can be viewed as direct descendants of the Imagists. Continuing a tradition established in Paris, Zukofsky, Reznikoff, and Oppen went on to form the Objectivist Press to publish books by themselves and by Williams. In his later work, Zukofsky developed his view of the poem as object to include experimenting with mathematical models for creating poems, producing effects similar {{to the creation of a}} Bach fugue or a piece of serial music.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that {{the course of the}} River Wear, prior to the last Ice Age, was much as it is now as far as Chester-le-Street. This can be {{established}} as a result of boreholes, of which there have been many in the Wear valley due to coal mining. However, northwards from Chester-le-Street, the Wear may have originally followed the current route of the lower River Team. The last glaciation reached its peak about 18,500 years ago, from which time it also began a progressive retreat, leaving a wide variety of glacial deposits in its wake, filling existing river valleys with silt, sand and other glacial till. At about 14,000 years ago, retreat of the ice paused for maybe 500 years at the city of Durham. This can be established by the types of glacial deposits in the vicinity of Durham City. The confluence of the River Browney was pushed from Gilesgate (the abandoned river valley still exists in Pelaw Woods), several miles south to Sunderland Bridge (Croxdale). At Chester-le-Street, when glacial boulder clay was deposited blocking its northerly course, the River Wear was diverted eastwards towards Sunderland where it was forced to cut a new, shallower valley. The gorge cut by the river through the Permian Magnesian Limestone can be seen most <b>clearly</b> <b>at</b> Ford Quarry. In the 17th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica (1990), reference is made to a pre-Ice Age course of the River Wear outfalling at Hartlepool.|$|E

500|$|... : The Winchester (or Parker) Chronicle is {{the oldest}} {{manuscript}} of the Chronicle that survives. It was begun at Old Minster, Winchester, {{towards the end of}} Alfred's reign. The manuscript begins with a genealogy of Alfred, and the first chronicle entry is for the year 60 BC. The section containing the Chronicle takes up folios 1–32. Unlike the other manuscripts, [...] is of early enough composition to show entries dating back to the late 9th century in the hands of different scribes as the entries were made. The first scribe's hand is dateable to the late 9th or very early 10th century; his entries cease in late 891, and the following entries were made at intervals throughout the 10th century by several scribes. The eighth scribe wrote the annals for the years 925–955, and was <b>clearly</b> <b>at</b> Winchester when he wrote them since he adds some material related to events there; he also uses ceaster, or [...] "city", to mean Winchester. The manuscript becomes independent of the other recensions after the entry for 975. The book, which also had a copy of the Laws of Alfred and Ine bound in after the entry for 924, was transferred to Canterbury some time in the early 11th century, as evidenced by a list of books that Archbishop Parker gave to Corpus Christi. While at Canterbury, some interpolations were made; this required some erasures in the manuscript. The additional entries appear to have been taken from a version of the manuscript from which [...] descends. The last entry in the vernacular is for 1070. After this comes the Latin Acta Lanfranci, which covers church events from 1070–1093. This is followed by a list of popes and the Archbishops of Canterbury to whom they sent the pallium. The manuscript was acquired by Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury (1559–1575) and master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, following the dissolution of the monasteries, and bequeathed to the college on his death. It now forms part of the Parker Library.|$|E

500|$|Taylor summoned Khánh to his office, but the Vietnamese leader sent Thi, Kỳ, Thiệu and Admiral Chung Tấn Cang, the {{commander}} of the Republic of Vietnam Navy, instead. Taylor asked the four to sit down and then said [...] "Do all of you understand English?" [...] The ambassador then angrily denounced the officers. According to Stanley Karnow, Taylor [...] "launched into a tirade, scolding them as if he were still superintendent of West Point and they a group of cadets caught cheating". He said [...] "I told you all <b>clearly</b> <b>at</b> General Westmoreland's dinner we Americans were tired of coups. Apparently I wasted my words." [...] He decried the removal of the HNC as [...] "totally illegal", and said it had [...] "destroyed the government-making process", and that [...] "I made it clear that all the military plans I know you would like to carry out are dependent on government stability", something he felt had been lost with the dismissal of the HNC. He said [...] "...you have made a real mess. We cannot carry you forever if you do things like this." [...] Taylor believed the HNC to be {{an essential part of the}} government, because as an American, he believed civilian legitimacy was a must. For him, the HNC was a necessary step in a progression towards an elected civilian legislature, which he regarded as critical for national and military morale. The historian Mark Moyar regarded Taylor's intervention as unnecessary, and noted that there had been many instances of fierce fighting in Vietnamese history despite the complete absence of democracy throughout the nation's history. Taylor also reminded them of an earlier meeting where he had discussed an American plan to expand the war, increase funding for the South Vietnamese military, and to go on the offensive against the communists at the request of Khánh. Taylor said the Americans would not be able to help Saigon pursue their desired military strategy if the political machinations did not stop. Taylor said that if the military did not transfer some powers or advisory capacity back to the HNC or another civilian institution, aid would be withheld, and some planned military operations against the Ho Chi Minh trail—which was being used to infiltrate communists into the south—would be suspended.|$|E

Receiving no guidance from Richmond in response to his urgent requests, he unilaterally decided to strip his defenses from the Howlett Line, which was bottling up Butler's army in Bermuda Hundred, making the divisions of Maj. Gens. Robert Hoke and Bushrod Johnson available for the new Petersburg defensive line. Butler might have used this opportunity to move his army between Petersburg and Richmond, which would have doomed the Confederate capital, but he once again failed to act.|$|E
2500|$|For cubic graphs, biconnectivity and bridgelessness are equivalent.

If the vertices of a graph G are expanded to form a cubic graph, which is then circularly embedded, and [...] the expansions are undone by contracting the added edges, the result will be a circular embedding of G itself. Therefore, if the cycle double cover conjecture is true, every biconnected graph has a circular embedding. That is, the cycle double cover conjecture is equivalent to {{the circular}} embedding conjecture, even though a cycle double cover and a circular embedding are not always the same thing.|$|E
