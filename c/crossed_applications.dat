40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} <b>cross</b> <b>applications</b> in civil protection order proceedings in New South Wales (NSW) (known as Apprehended Domestic Violence Orders, ADVOs). A <b>cross</b> <b>application</b> takes place when one person in an existing or former intimate relationship, usually the woman, applies for an ADVO and sometime afterwards the defendant in that originating application, usually the man, seeks an ADVO against the first person. The focus on <b>cross</b> <b>applications</b> provides a means to investigate the nature of men’s and women’s competing allegations about domestic violence, and to explore {{the way in which}} professionals working within the ADVO system approach, and seek to unravel, these competing claims. This thesis draws on the extensive debate within the sociological literature about ‘what is domestic violence’ and whether domestic violence is gendered in its perpetration. This debate has been paid scant attention in the legal literature. This thesis {{examines the}} assumptions underpinning the legal definitions and understandings of domestic violence in the civil protection order system, with reference to these theoretical debates about ‘what is domestic violence’ and ‘what counts as domestic violence’. To do so it draws on empirical work: semi-structured in-depth interviews with women involved in <b>cross</b> <b>applications</b> and key professionals working in the field, documentary analysis of court files, and observations of court proceedings. The key contribution of this thesis to this literature is threefold: (1) it explores the question of gender perpetration through the investigation of official data (a data source little explored in debates about gender and domestic violence), (2) it combines qualitative and quantitative methods in a single study, and (3) it extends questions about the gendered perpetration of domestic violence to the legal arena (in particular the prime legal arena that responds to domestic violence in NSW, the ADVO system, a system ostensibly designed to better respond to domestic violence). This thesis found that, like other studies in this field, the analysis of quantitative data alone reveals few differences between the types of violence men and women are alleged to use against their intimate partners. However when supplemented by qualitative data differences started to emerge particularly for men who lodged their application second in time. This qualitative analysis reveals not only that male second applicants appeared to make claims of a different nature, but that some men appeared to use the ADVO process to undermine women’s claims for legal protection. The differences that emerged between men and women’s alleged experiences of domestic violence resonated with feminist understandings of domestic violence that highlight its function of control and the repetitive, cumulative environment in which violence is perpetrated by men against women. While the study focussed on <b>cross</b> <b>applications,</b> its findings reveal a number of issues of concern for the ADVO system more broadly: its focus on incidents, the poor quality of complaint narratives, the brevity of court proceedings and the emphasis on settlement. These features undermine the progressive potential of the ADVO legislation to capture more than single incidents of largely physical violence. This was further {{compounded by the fact that}} while the professionals interviewed articulated broad definitions of domestic violence, this tended to be lost when responding to practice-orientated questions (here professionals returned to incident-based definitions). Perhaps more significantly the defining feature of domestic violence as a mechanism of control is not articulated in the NSW legislation, and hence (not unsurprisingly) was generally not articulated in the complaint narratives examined in this thesis. Yet control was the dominant way in which the women interviewed described their relationship with their former partner. The failure of complaint narratives to reflect the dimension of control, combined with the failure of key professionals to give sufficient emphasis to control in their practice under the ADVO legislation, an absence highlighted through the focus on <b>cross</b> <b>applications,</b> is an issue of concern for the ADVO system generally. This is important given the growing recognition in the research literature of the fundamental nature of control to the experience of domestic violence, particularly women’s experiences of domestic violence...|$|R

They wanted an {{evaluation}} of HTML 5 <b>cross</b> platform <b>applications</b> which studied HTML 5 features as well as JavaScript libraries and frameworks.

These types ofapplications are called <b>cross</b> platform <b>applications</b> and can be developed with specic tools.

40|$|In-network data {{aggregation}} is a promising communication mechanism to reduce bandwidth requirements of applications in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Many aggregation schemes have been proposed, often with varying features. Most aggregation schemes are tailored to specific application scenarios and for specific aggregation operations.

An application centric view of aggregation does also not {{tap into the}} potential of <b>cross</b> <b>application</b> aggregation. Generic modeling may help to unlock this potential. We outline a generic modeling approach to enable improved comparability of aggregation schemes and facilitate joint optimization for different applications of aggregation schemes for VANETs.

40|$|Much {{research}} {{has examined the}} use of awareness tools for enhancing coordination. However, the proposed tools tend to either make people aware of one information source in great detail or {{a variety of sources}} with very little detail. We refer to this problem as the detail-variety trade-off. Another problem with awareness tools is that they are not interchangeable. Specifically, users of these tools have only limited ability to route awareness information to different types of awareness tools that might better suit their work styles. We believe these two problems are primarily software engineering problems to which we present a solution called CASS (<b>Cross</b> <b>Application</b> Subscription Services), for obtaining awareness information from diverse sources and routing it to a variety of awareness tools.

40|$|Abstract—Mobile {{application}} development {{is becoming more}} challenging with diverse platforms and their software development kits. In {{order to reduce the}} cost of development and reach out to maximum users across several platforms, developers are migrating to <b>cross</b> platform <b>application</b> development tools. In this paper, we provide several decision criteria beyond the portability concerns for choosing suitable cross platform tool for {{application development}}. The desirable requirements in a cross platform framework are identified. A general architecture for <b>cross</b> platform <b>application</b> development is discussed. Then a survey of several write once run anywhere tools (PhoneGap, Titanium, Sencha Touch) are provided along with a classification and comparison among the tools. To examine the performance in terms of CPU, memory usage, power consumption, Android test applications are developed using such tools. It is found that PhoneGap consumes less memory, CPU and power since it does not included dedicated UI components. Finally the paper summarizes the contributions and concludes with some future directions. Keywords-mobile development; cross platform tools; PhoneGap; Titanium; Android. I...|$|R

In this pa-per we discuss the use of annotations on visualization dash-boards, with a special focus on business intelligence (BI) anal-ysis.

We focus particularly on novel annotation aspects, such as multi-target annotations, annotation transparency across charts and data dimension lev-els, as well as annotation properties such as lifetime and va-lidity. Moreover, our prototype is built on a data layer shared among different data-sources and BI <b>applications,</b> allowing <b>cross</b> <b>application</b> annotations.
