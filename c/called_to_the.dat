5|$|Gray's Inn's {{internal}} records {{date from}} 1569, {{at which point}} there were four types of member; {{those who had not}} yet been <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bar, Utter Barristers, Ancients and Readers. Utter Barristers were those who had been <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bar but were still studying, Ancients were those who were <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bar and were allowed to practise and Readers were those who had been <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bar, were allowed to practise and now played a part in educating law students at the Inns of Chancery and at Gray's Inn itself. At the time Gray's Inn was the odd one out amongst the Inns; the others did not recognise Ancients as a degree of barrister and had Benchers roughly corresponding to the Readers used at Gray's Inn (although the positions were not identical).|$|E

5|$|Birkett {{received}} his education at Barrow-in-Furness Grammar School. He was a Methodist preacher and a draper before attending Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1907, to study theology, history and law.

5000|$|<b>Call</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Post -- During each pregame show, a solo trumpeter plays <b>Call</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Post into a {{microphone}} {{to be heard}} throughout the stadium. This is a reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city of Louisville's long history with horse racing as <b>the</b> <b>Call</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Post tune is customarily played by a bugler just minutes before a horse race. There is usually a second playing of this, occurring just {{before the start of}} the second half of the football game by the same trumpeter that played it during pregame. This year, for the first time in CMB history the trumpet player that plays <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> post is a freshman.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{swapping}} {{two variables}} in object-oriented languages such as C++ may involve one <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> class constructor and destructor for the temporary variable, and three <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> copy constructor. Some classes may allocate memory in the constructor and deallocate {{it in the}} destructor, thus creating expensive <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> system. Copy constructors for classes containing a lot of data, e.g. in an array, may even need <b>to</b> copy <b>the</b> data manually.|$|R

5|$|Dissatisfied {{with the}} law, Jinnah briefly {{embarked}} on a stage career with a Shakespearean company, but resigned after receiving a stern letter from his father. In 1895, at age 19, he became the youngest Indian to be <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bar in England. Although he returned to Karachi, he remained there {{only a short time}} before moving to Bombay.|$|E
5|$|Having {{returned}} to active military duty, Middleton {{was assigned to}} a training regiment at Camp Wheeler, Georgia where he was quickly promoted to colonel on 1 February, and oversaw the combat training of thousands of recruits. After less than two months, {{he was given a}} rapid succession of assignments, including to Camp Gordon, Georgia and Camp Blanding, Florida. While at Blanding he was <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> War Department in Washington, where he was given an assignment to be a staff officer in London, but this rapidly changed when he was subsequently <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> War College, and met a classmate from Command and General Staff School, Brigadier General Mark Clark, who told him that he was being assigned to the Forty-fifth Infantry Division at Fort Devens, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|His Oxford {{experiences}} {{made him}} a socialist and he joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation shortly after it was formed in 1932 during his summer vacation. He helped form an overseas branch of the CCF at Oxford that year. He was <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bar in England, {{and was the first}} Canadian to win the Arden scholarship. When Jolliffe permanently returned from Oxford, he worked as the CCF's Ontario organizer and was <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bar in Ontario and practised law in Toronto from 1938 onwards.|$|E

5|$|In 1733 the {{requirements}} for {{a call to the}} Bar were significantly revised in a joint meeting between the Benchers of Inner Temple and Gray's Inn, revisions accepted by Lincoln's Inn and Middle Temple, although they were not represented. It is not recorded what these changes were, but after a further discussion in 1762 the Inns adopted a rule that any student with a Master of Arts or Bachelor of Laws degree from the universities of Oxford or Cambridge could be <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bar after three years as a student, and any other student could be called after five years. An attempt was made to increase the quality of legal education at Gray's Inn; in 1753 a barrister, Danby Pickering, was employed to lecture there, although this agreement ended in 1761 when he was <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bar.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that search SVP is {{equivalent}} to optimization SVP. However, the former reduction from search SVP to optimization SVP by Kannan needs polynomial times <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> oracle that solves the optimization SVP. In this paper, a new rank-preserving reduction is presented with only one <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> optimization SVP oracle. It is obvious that the new reduction needs the least calls, and improves Kannan's classical result. What's more, the idea also leads a similar direct reduction from search CVP to optimization CVP with only one <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> oracle...|$|R

Beilhart's conviction that faith-healing was the remedy for illness put him in disfavor with the sanitarium officials and he was asked to resign.|$|E

5|$|After {{attending}} Salisbury Boys' School, Milton High School in Bulawayo and Diocesan College, Rondebosch, Beadle studied {{law at the}} University of Cape Town. He {{completed his}} Bachelor of Laws degree in 1928, then continued his studies in England as a Rhodes Scholar at The Queen's College, Oxford. There he played rugby and tennis for the college, boxed for the university and qualified as a pilot with the Oxford University Air Squadron. He graduated with a second-class Bachelor of Civil Law degree in 1930, and soon after was <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English bar. He briefly read in London chambers before commencing practice in Bulawayo in 1931. In 1934 he married Leonie Barry, a farmer's daughter from Barrydale in the Cape of Good Hope; they had two daughters.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} {{military}} in 1917, Diefenbaker returned to Saskatchewan where he resumed his work as an articling student in law.

5|$|As a {{manufacturing}} center, Pittsburgh also became an arena for intense labor strife. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, Pittsburgh workers protested and had massive demonstrations that erupted into widespread violence, {{known as the}} Pittsburgh Railway Riots. Militia and federal troops were <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city to suppress the strike. Forty men died, most of them workers, and more than 40 buildings were burned down, including the Union Depot of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Strikers also burned and destroyed rolling stock: more than 100 train engines and 1000 railcars were destroyed. It was the city with the most violence of any affected by the strikes.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a middle-class}} family, Coke was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, before leaving {{to study at}} the Inner Temple, where he was <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bar on 20 April 1578. As a {{barrister}} he took part in several notable cases, including Slade's Case, before earning enough political favour to be elected to Parliament, where he served first as Solicitor General and then as Speaker of the House of Commons. Following a promotion to Attorney General he led the prosecution in several notable cases, including those against Robert Devereux, Sir Walter Raleigh, and the Gunpowder Plot conspirators. As a reward for his services he was first knighted and then made Chief Justice of the Common Pleas.|$|E
