25|$|Monterey's noise {{pollution}} has been mapped {{to define the}} principal sources of noise and to ascertain {{the areas of the}} population exposed to significant levels. Principal sources are the Monterey Regional Airport, State Route 1 and major arterial streets such as Munras Avenue, Fremont Street, Del Monte Boulevard, and Camino Aguajito. While most of Monterey is a quiet residential city, a moderate {{number of people in the}} northern part of the city are exposed to aircraft noise at levels in excess of 60dB on the <b>Community</b> <b>Noise</b> Equivalent Level (CNEL) scale. The most intense source is State Route 1: all residents exposed to levels greater than 65 CNEL—about 1600 people—live near State Route 1 or one of the principal arterial streets.|$|E
25|$|State Route 85 roughly {{marks the}} {{northern}} {{boundary of the}} town, although a few pockets of homes to its North are included. Highway 9 (Los Gatos-Saratoga Road) from the coast terminates at Highway 17. Downtown Los Gatos, the area on and around Santa Cruz Avenue and Main Street, {{is located in the}} southwest quadrant of town. A left exit on northbound Highway 17 becomes the south end of South Santa Cruz Avenue, leading into downtown. The area around Los Gatos Boulevard, east of Highway 17, is much more typically suburban than downtown, with medium-sized shopping centers clustered at major intersections of the multilane boulevard. Although the town has generally a quiet setting, its principal noise generators are State Route 17 and Los Gatos Boulevard. Sound levels within one hundred and fifty feet of Los Gatos Boulevard exceed 60 CNEL (<b>Community</b> <b>Noise</b> Equivalent Level), a generally unacceptable range for residential living.|$|E

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of mixed source noises {{has been considered}} as an important and urgent problem to be solved for the environmental noise study. In order to contribute to this problem a series of the Simulated Domestic Living Room experiments were carried out both at the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research and Muroran Institute of Technology. In Experiment I (ISVR) and Experiment Ⅲ (Muroran) the dose-response relations of separately reproduced aircraft, railroad, and road traffic noises were investigated. Whereas in Experiment Ⅱ (ISVR) and Experiment Ⅳ, aircraft and road traffic noises were systematically combined and the dose-response relations of the mixed source noises were investigated. The findings are summarized as follows : ① The Simulated Domestic Living Room procedure is validated to a satisfactory extent through four independent experiments carried out in two different countries. ② L_ is proven useful to the {{evaluation of}} annoyance due to the same noise source.

40|$|Detecting {{communities}} in large-scale networks is a challenging task when each vertex may belong to multiple communities, {{as is often}} the case in social networks. The multiple memberships of vertices and thus the strong overlaps among communities render many detection algorithms invalid. We develop a Partial Community Merger Algorithm (PCMA) for detecting communities with significant overlaps as well as slightly overlapping and disjoint ones. It is a bottom-up approach based on properly reassembling partial information of communities revealed in ego networks of vertices to reconstruct complete <b>communities.</b> <b>Noise</b> control and merger order are the two key issues in implementing this idea. We propose a novel similarity measure between two merged communities that can suppress noise and an efficient algorithm that recursively merges the most similar pair of communities. The validity and accuracy of PCMA is tested against two benchmarks and compared to four existing algorithms. It is the most efficient one with linear complexity and it outperforms the compared algorithms when vertices have multiple memberships. PCMA is applied to two huge online social networks, Friendster and Sina Weibo. Millions of communities are detected and they are of higher qualities than the corresponding metadata groups. We find that the latter should not be regarded as the ground-truth of structural communities. The significant overlapping pattern found in the detected communities confirms the need of new algorithms, such as PCMA, to handle multiple memberships of vertices in social networks...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{literature}} on noise annoyance emphasizes that acoustical factors cannot totally explain the annoyance felt by a population exposed to <b>community</b> <b>noises,</b> {{and that some}} non-acoustical factors {{have an effect on}} annoyance. This research paper deals with the annoyance caused by combined noises coming from road traffic and an industrial site. This type of combination has been very little studied to date. An. in situ study was conducted in an area of a French town exposed to these two noise sources. To investigate the annoyance caused by these combined noises, the work involved both a mapping of the industrial and road traffic noises present in the survey area and a questionnaire designed to evaluate the noise annoyance experienced by residents and to identify the factors that probably influence noise annoyance. The results highlight the link between the noise levels measured and the annoyance felt by the respondents. They also show that certain non-acoustical factors have an impact on annoyance felt. Indeed, the results highlight a positive correlation between fear of industrial sites and the annoyance expressed. They also show correlations between some items to evaluate noise sensitivity and the annoyance expressed. No significant correlation has been found between annoyance and the other non-acoustical factors such as age, sex and length of residence. Finally, several total annoyance models were tested for this noise combination. Two of them, namely the strongest component model and a proposed perceptual version of the mixed model, were able to better predict total annoyance than the other tested models...|$|R
50|$|Urban areas {{typically}} exhibit diurnal noise patterns where {{background noise}} is higher during the daytime and lower at night, where {{the noise floor}} directly correlates to urban activity (e.g., automobile traffic, airplane traffic, construction, and so on). During the day, when the noise floor is higher, a typical handgun muzzle blast may propagate {{as much as a}} mile. During the night, when the noise floor is lower, a typical handgun muzzle blast may propagate as much as 2 miles. Therefore, a co-located array of microphones or a distributed array of acoustic sensors that hear a muzzle blast at different times can contribute to calculating the location of the origin of the discharge provided that each microphone/sensor can specify to within a millisecond when it detected the impulse. Using this information, it is possible to discriminate between gunfire and normal <b>community</b> <b>noises</b> by placing acoustic sensors at wide distances so that only extremely loud sounds (i.e., gunfire) can reach several sensors; this has been termed a ‘spatial filter’ in the first patent issued to ShotSpotter, Inc.Infrared detection systems have a similar advantage at night because the sensor does not have to contend with any solar contributions to the background signal. At night, the signature of the gunshot will not be partially hidden within the background of solar IR contributions. Most flash suppressors are designed to minimize the visible signature of the gunfire. Flash suppressors break up the expanding gases into focused cones, thereby minimizing the blossoming effect of the exploding gasses. These focused cones contain more of the signature in a smaller volume. The added signal strength helps to increase detection range.|$|R

5000|$|... {{there are}} three levels of {{regulation}} for stationary sound sources. The most basic is the general one associated with noise disturbance. (See Noise Disturbance below.) It is a very broad subjective immission control that has evolved from earlier disturbance of the peace provisions. Subjectivity can lead to arbitrary enforcement. The next level of regulation is less broad; it is an objective immission control that uses specific levels of sound {{considered to be a}} noise disturbance. Arbitrary enforcement is reduced. (See Maximum Permissible Sound Levels below.) In both cases, however, the person creating the sound may not be aware that his actions are in violation.
