50|$|<b>Contingent</b> <b>valuation</b> is a survey-based {{economic}} {{technique for}} the valuation of non-market resources, such as environmental preservation or {{the impact of}} contamination. While these resources do give people utility, certain aspects {{of them do not}} have a market price as they are not directly sold - for example, people receive benefit from a beautiful view of a mountain, but it would be tough to value using price-based models. <b>Contingent</b> <b>valuation</b> surveys are one technique which is used to measure these aspects. <b>Contingent</b> <b>valuation</b> {{is often referred to as}} a stated preference model, in contrast to a price-based revealed preference model. Both models are utility-based. Typically the survey asks how much money people would be willing to pay (or willing to accept) to maintain the existence of (or be compensated for the loss of) an environmental feature, such as biodiversity.|$|E

50|$|If the <b>contingent</b> <b>valuation</b> {{method is}} used to elicit {{willingness}} to pay for two government policies independently (the parts) {{the sum of the}} independently estimated willingness to pay amounts may be different from the willingness to pay elicited for both projects (the whole). This result is troubling if the projects are geographically related, for example, different wilderness areas (McFadden, 1994). This result does not violate the nonsatiation axiom of consumer theory if projects are perfect substitutes (Carson and Mitchell, 1995).

50|$|Calculating {{the true}} social {{marginal}} cost {{can be a}} lot easier than measuring the social marginal benefit. Because of the uncertainty involved with calculating benefits, problems may arise e.g., should a dollar amount be put on time based on average wages, <b>contingent</b> <b>valuations</b> or revealed preferences? One of the big problems today is putting a value on a life. While some might say that a life is priceless, economists usually state the value to be somewhere between three and ten million dollars. Another problem is that because the current generation will often be paying for most of the costs while future generations will be reaping most of the benefit, whether current and future benefits ought to be weighed differently.|$|R

50|$|The effect {{suggests}} the <b>contingent</b> <b>valuation</b> method {{is not an}} unbiased approach to measuring policy impacts for cost-benefit analysis of environmental, and other government, policies. Few government policies are independent of any other governmental policy. Most policies involve either substitute or complementary relationships with others at either the same or different intergovernmental level. For example, the protection of coastal water quality is a goal of both state and multiple federal agencies. The Clean Water Act, wetlands protection programs, and fisheries management plans all address coastal water quality. These policies may be substitutes or complements for each other. These relationships complicate {{the application of the}} <b>contingent</b> <b>valuation</b> method. The resulting problems that may be encountered have been called the part-whole bias and sequencing and nesting (see below).|$|E
50|$|The method rose to high {{prominence}} in the 1980s when government agencies were given the power to sue for damage to environmental resources which they were trustees over. Following Ohio v Department of the Interior, the types of damages which {{they were able to}} recover included non-use or existence values. Existence values are unable to be assessed through market pricing mechanisms, so <b>contingent</b> <b>valuation</b> surveys were suggested to assess them. During this time, the EPA convened an important conference with an aim to recommend guidelines for survey design. The Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound was the first case where <b>contingent</b> <b>valuation</b> surveys were used in a quantitative assessment of damages. Use of the technique has spread from there.|$|E

To demonstrate the potential of this method, we use it to value American-style options on the average price (or Asian options).
