Although the announcement had the general support of the Opposition leader Dr Keith Rowley, he expressed disappointment that the government was [...] "only going halfway" [...] by planning to adopt the CCJ for criminal appeals only while retaining the Privy Council for civil matters and cautioned that the move may not be legally possible under the relevant treaties. He said the opposition People's National Movement was fully supportive of adopting the CCJ as a final appeals court on all matters, both civil and criminal. It has been observed however that there is a precedent for the partial abolition of appeals to the Privy Council with Canada ending criminal appeals to the court in 1933 and civil appeals in 1949.|$|E

40|$|Making commitments, e. g., through {{promises}} and threats, enables {{a player to}} exploit the strengths of his own strategic position {{as well as the}} weaknesses of that of his opponents. Which commitments a player can make with credibility depends on the circumstances. In some, a player can only commit to the performance of an action, in others, he can commit himself conditionally on the actions of the other players. Some situations even allow for commitments on commitments or for commitments to randomized actions. We explore the formal properties of these types of (conditional) commitment and their interrelationships. So as to preclude inconsistencies among conditional commitments, we assume an order in which the players make their commitments. Central to our analyses is the notion of an extortion, which we define, for a given order of the players, as a profile that contains, for each player, an optimal <b>commitment</b> <b>given</b> the commitments of the players that committed earlier. On this basis, we investigate for different commitment types whether it is advantageous to commit earlier rather than later, and how the outcomes obtained through extortions relate to backward induction and Pareto efficiency...|$|E

This innovative pedagogical approach has been embraced rapidly though it goes through a process. The introduction of blended learning (combination of face-to-face and online {{teaching and}} learning) initiatives is part of these innovations but its uptake, especially in the developing world faces challenges for it to be an effective innovation in {{teaching and learning}}. Blended learning effectiveness has quite a number of underlying factors that pose challenges. One big challenge is about how users can successfully use the technology and ensuring participants’ <b>commitment</b> <b>given</b> the individual learner characteristics and encounters with technology (Hofmann, 2014). Hofmann adds that users getting into difficulties with technology may result into abandoning the learning and eventual failure of technological applications. In a report by Oxford Group (2013), some learners (16 %) had negative attitudes to blended learning while 26 % were concerned that learners would not complete study in blended learning. Learners are important partners in any learning process and therefore, their backgrounds and characteristics affect their ability to effectively carry on with learning and being in blended learning, the design tools to be used may impinge on the effectiveness in their learning.|$|E
