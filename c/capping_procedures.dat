40|$|Objective: {{to obtain}} a {{histological}} comparison of tertiary dentin after indirect pulp <b>capping</b> <b>procedures</b> using calcium hydroxide or MTA in teeth with deep carious lesions, regarding its morphological characteristics and degree of inflammation induced in the dental pulp. We used 60 third molars with occlusal caries lesions from 30 patients of 17 - 26 years of age. Class I and II deep cavities were prepared and randomly restored with calcium hydroxide or MTA and glass ionomer cement. The histologic specimens were obtained at 2 - 4 - 6 weeks and the evaluation {{was done by the}} same person in a double blind manner. The results showed statistical significant differences between these capping materials regarding the formation rate and morphology of tertiary dentin induced by indirect pulp <b>capping</b> <b>procedures.</b> Conclusion: the success of this therapy is conditioned by the use of dental materials that contain or can deliver calcium hydroxide, completed with a final restoration without marginal leakage, which prevents microbial infiltration from oral cavity...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the available evidence}} on pulp <b>capping</b> <b>procedures</b> and root canal treatment in young permanent teeth with vital pulps exposed by caries.

40|$|Aim of study. To {{evaluate}} {{the outcome of}} direct pulp <b>capping</b> <b>procedures</b> in permanent teeth performed by postgraduate students during their training program in Endodontics. Material and Methods. 39 patients with dental pulp exposures were evaluated clinically and radiologically after direct pulp capping procedure and followed for at least 24 months. The results were considered successful if the tooth remained vital, with neither symptoms nor periapical radiolucency. Results. The success rate of direct pulp capping was 59. 3 %, associated more with traumatic exposure than with carious exposure (75 % versus 29. 03 %, p˂ 0, 001) and more with class I occlusal restorations (85. 71 %) than with proximal restorations (class II 59. 09 %, class III 66. 67 %, p= 0, 009).

40|$|AIM: Pulp capping {{represents}} {{the boundary between}} conservative and endodontic therapy. The importance of this technique, which considerably improves the prognosis of the tooth, justifies the quest for new techniques and technologies: the most recent literature reports more predictable results (approximately 90 %) with cappings performed using laser of different wavelengths, compared to traditional procedures, which report a success rate of approximately 60 %. The purpose of this work is to assess the efficiency of laser technology combined {{with the use of}} a self-hardening calcium hydroxide base in pulp <b>capping</b> <b>procedures</b> performed on decayed permanent teeth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was carried out on 34 patients, aged between 11 and 18 years (average 14, 5) who needed pulp cappings for deep caries affecting permanent teeth (8 front and 26 back). They were divided into three groups based on the operative protocol employed: traditional technique, laser-assisted technique using Er,Cr:YSGG lasers (2780 nm) and laser assisted technique using Erbium:YAG lasers (2940 nm); all patients were asked to return for follow-up visits (anamnesis, vitality testing and intraoral x-ray) scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 12 months, 2 and 4 years; other 30 cases on adult patients (19 to 40 years, average 27, 1), treated with the same methods, were used as control group. RESULTS: Traditional technique group showed a success of 63 % (adult control group 50 %); Er,Cr:YSGG laser-assisted technique showed a success rate of 80 % (adult control group 80 %); Erbium:YAG lasers laser-assisted technique showed a success rate of 75 % (adult control group 70 %).

40|$|Less {{invasive}} excavation {{methods have}} been suggested for deep caries lesions. We tested the effects of stepwise vs. direct complete excavation, 1 yr after the procedure had been carried out, in 314 adults (from six centres) who had received treatment of a tooth with deep caries. The teeth had caries lesions involving 75 % {{or more of the}} dentin and were centrally randomized to stepwise or direct complete excavation. Stepwise excavation resulted in fewer pulp exposures compared with direct complete excavation [difference: 11. 4 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI) (1. 2; 21. 3) ]. At 1 yr of follow-up, there was a statistically significantly higher success rate with stepwise excavation, with success being defined as an unexposed pulp with sustained pulp vitality without apical radiolucency [difference: 11. 7 %, 95 % CI (0. 5; 22. 5) ].

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the pulpal response to direct pulp capping in healthy human teeth with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) as against calcium hydroxide cement (Dycal) as control. METHODOLOGY: Twenty healthy human third molars had iatrogenic pulpotomy and direct pulp capping with MTA. Another 13 teeth were capped with Dycal as controls. The teeth were restored, with IRM, clinically reviewed and extracted {{after a number}} of pre-determined intervals (1 week, 1 month and 3 months). The specimens were fixed, decalcified, subdivided axially into two halves in the oro-buccal (lingual-buccal) plane, embedded in plastic, serial sectioned and evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively by correlative light and transmission electron microscopy with appropriate statistical evaluation of the quantitative data. RESULTS: Iatrogenic pulpal wounds treated with MTA were mostly free from inflammation after 1 week and became covered with a compact, hard tissue barrier of steadily increasing length and thickness within 3 months following capping. Control teeth treated with Dycal revealed distinctly less consistent formation of a hard tissue barrier that had numerous tunnel defects. The presence of pulpal inflammation up to the longest observation period (3 months) after capping, was a common feature in Dycal specimens. CONCLUSIONS: The MTA was clinically easier to use as a direct pulp-capping agent and resulted in less pulpal inflammation and more predictable hard tissue barrier formation than Dycal.

40|$|Background {{and aims}} Piece-meal {{endoscopic}} resection of early neoplastic lesions larger than 15 - 20 mm is a laborious <b>procedure</b> with the <b>cap</b> technique. Multiband mucosectomy {{is a new}} technique using a modified variceal band ligator. Submucosal lifting and prelooping of the snare in the cap is not necessary and multiple resections can be performed with a single snare. We prospectively evaluated the feasibility of multiband mucosectomy for widespread endoscopic resection in patients with a Barrett's esophagus with early neoplasia and compared results retrospectively with prospectively registered endoscopic <b>cap</b> resection <b>procedures.</b> Results Eighty multiband mucosectomy procedures were performed in 40 patients and 86 endoscopic <b>cap</b> resection <b>procedures</b> in 53 patients. Median duration of the multiband mucosectomy procedures was 37 vs. 50 min for endoscopic <b>cap</b> resection <b>procedures</b> (P= 0. 06); median duration per resection was 6 vs. 12 min, respectively (P < 0. 001). Mean diameter of the specimens was 17 vs. 21 mm (P < 0. 001). One perforation in the endoscopic cap resection group was successfully treated conservatively. Mild bleeding occurred in 6 % of multiband mucosectomy and 20 % of endoscopic <b>cap</b> resection <b>procedures</b> (P= 0. 012). Technical difficulties during multiband mucosectomy procedures included a decreased visibility owing to the black bands and the releasing wires. Conclusions Multiband mucosectomy allows safe and easy widespread piece-meal resections in Barrett's esophagus. Time and costs appear to be saved compared with the cap technique, and multiband mucosectomy appears to cause less bleeding during the endoscopic resection procedure. Multiband mucosectomy, however, results in smaller specimens and is, therefore, most suited for en-bloc resection of lesions smaller than 10 mm or for widespread resection of flat mucos...|$|R

The crude peptide was purified by high-performance liquid chromatographic ion exchange and gel permeation chromatography in chloroform-methanol mixtures.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis runs produced the typical monomer-pentamer structural pattern. A predominantly helical CD spectrum was obtained in 0. 075 % C 12 E 8 (67. 9 % helix, 1. 8 % beta, 12. 2 % turn, 18. 1 % random coil).

The inhibition was mainly due to a decrease in the affinity (Km(Ca)) of the ATPase for Ca 2 + and was partially reversed by PLN phosphorylation with protein kinase A. By contrast, addition of PLN to diluted intact SR vesicles uncoupled the Ca(2 +) -transport reaction, suggesting an ionophoric effect of PLN.

Mesocosms experiments were undertaken to evaluate the relative effectiveness of olivine material as a capping material for the containment of selected sediment contaminants, compared with that obtained with natural sand. Two different contaminated sediments impacted by a range of contaminants were used in this study. The primary objective was to compare sediment-overlying water fluxes of contaminants out of these sediments prior to and following capping with thin layers of olivine or natural sand. Additionally, populations of a selected benthic organism, ragworm, were added prior to cap placement in order to provide natural bioturbators to the sediments. Following cap placement two series of measurements of pore water and whole-sediment Hg concentration-depth profiles were made. Both capping materials did not appear to impact on ragworm activity. This work demonstrates some differences between contaminant fluxes observed following capping of contaminated sediments with olivine versus capping with sand. However, in many cases, these differences are limited. Based on these results and for these particular experimental conditions, no clear advantage of using olivine compared with sand for purposes such as thin layer capping. Alternative experimental designs may be implemented in to corroborate these findings. It is likely that increasing the thickness of the cap will result in an increase in the efficiency of olivine to reduce contaminant fluxes when the aim is isolation capping.

Several manufacturers propose wet-mateable connectors based on integrated valve systems but the complexity and precision needed to reach the required reliability result in high cost. We are therefore developing {{a new type of}} tooling for connecting cheap standard wet-mateable connectors under oil in deep sea water pressure conditions. Complexity is delocalised from the connector to the easily recoverable and reparable tooling. The cost of wet connections is consequently expected to be drastically reduced, with reliability enhanced. The tooling contains 2 carriers sliding on a linear stage together with a second perpendicular stage intersecting the line between the carriers. The carriers and linear stages are enclosed in a clam-shelled oil-fillable volume. Each half of the connector to be mated is fixed to its respective carrier in a ROV operation. The waterproof caps of the two connectors automatically attach to the third carrier on the perpendicular stage. Seawater around the connectors is replaced with non-conductive oil, and both halves of the connector are detached from their sealing caps, which are then moved sideways to allow the connector to be mated under oil.

Objective. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the histological effects of Emdogain® on exposed tooth pulp of a Vietnamese pig (Sus scrofa verus). Methods. The study comprised 20 teeth of a Vietnamese pig. After class V preparation on the buccal surfaces of incisors, canines and first premolars, pulp was exposed. In the experimental group, the perforations were capped with Emdogain® (Straumann, Basel, Switzerland), while in the control group pulp capping was performed with MTA® (Dentsply Tulsa Dental, Johnson City, TN, USA). All cavities were restored with glass-ionomer cement (GC Fuji VIII, GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The observational period was 28 days, after which the animal was sacrificed and histological preparations were made. A light microscope was used to analyze dentin bridge formation, tissue reorganization and inflammation, and the presence of bacteria in the pulp. Results. The formation of dentin bridge was observed in the experimental and control groups. Inflammation of the pulp was mild to moderate in both groups. Angiogenesis and many odontoblast-like cells, responsible for dentin bridge formation, were observed. Necrosis was not observed in any case, nor were bacteria present in the pulp. Conclusion. Histological analysis indicated a favorable therapeutic effect of Emdogain® Gel in direct pulp capping of Vietnamese pigs. Pulp reaction was similar to that of MTA®.

40|$|A convincing {{detection}} of primordial non-Gaussianity in the {{cosmic background radiation}} (CMB) is essential to probe the physics of the early universe. Since a single statistical estimator can hardly be suitable to detect the various possible forms of non-Gaussianity, {{it is important to}} employ different statistical indicators to study non-Gaussianity of CMB. This has motivated the proposal of a number statistical tools, including two large-angle indicators based on skewness and kurtosis of spherical caps of CMB sky-sphere. Although suitable to detect fairly large non-Gaussianity they are unable to detect non-Gaussianity within the Planck bounds, and exhibit power spectra with undesirable oscillation pattern. Here we use several thousands simulated CMB maps to examine interrelated problems regarding advances of these spherical patches procedures. We examine whether a change in the choice of the patches could enhance the sensitivity of the procedures well enough to detect large-angle non-Gaussianity within the Planck bounds. To this end, a new statistical procedure with non-overlapping cells is proposed and its capability is established. We also study whether this new procedure is capable to smooth out the undesirable oscillation pattern in the skewness and kurtosis power spectra of the spherical <b>caps</b> <b>procedure.</b> We show that the new procedure solves this problem, making clear this unexpected power spectra pattern does not have a physical origin, but rather presumably arises from the overlapping obtained with the spherical caps approach. Finally, we make a comparative analysis of this new statistical procedure with the spherical caps routine, determine their lower bounds for non-Gaussianity detection, and make apparent their relative strength and sensitivity.

40|$|Nerve capping {{techniques}} {{have been introduced}} as a promising treatment modality {{for the treatment of}} painful neuroma with varied outcomes; however, its exact mechanism is still unknown. RhoA is {{one of the members of}} the RAS superfamily of GTPases that operate as molecular switches and plays an important role in peripheral nerve regeneration. Our aim was to investigate the structural and morphologic mechanisms by which the nerve capping technique prevents the formation of painful neuromas after neuroectomy. We also hoped to provide a theoretical basis for this treatment approach. An aligned nanofiber conduit was used for the <b>capping</b> <b>procedure</b> and the sciatic nerve of Sprague-Dawley rats was selected as the animal model. Behavioral analysis, extent of neuroma formation, histological assessment, expressions of pain markers of substance P and c-fos, molecular biological changes as well as ultrastructural features were investigated and compared with the findings in a no-capping control group. The formation of traumatic neuromas was significantly inhibited in the capping group with relatively "normal" structural and morphological features and no occurrence of autotomy and significantly lower expression of pain markers compared to the no-capping group. The gene expression of RhoA was consistently in a higher level in the capping group within 8 weeks after surgery. This study shows that capping technique will alter the regeneration state of transected nerves and reduce painful neuroma formation, indicating a promising approach for the treatment of painful neuroma. The initiation of the "regenerative brake" induced by structural as well as morphological improvements in the severed nerve is theorized to be most likely a key mechanism for the capping technique in the prevention of painful neuroma formation...|$|R
