50|$|For motorcycles, the inline three-cylinder {{engine is}} {{considered}} advantageous {{as it is}} narrower than an inline-four and produces less vibration than a twin <b>cylinder</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{mounting}} {{the engine}} {{in line with}} the frame allows for a motorcycle as narrow as a single-cylinder engine, they also create a longer engine. A significant disadvantage for air-cooled engines is that the rear cylinder runs hotter than the front cylinder. For motorcycle racing purposes, they minimise the front area of the engine and chassis, allowing for a more aerodynamic and narrower front profile equivalent to a single <b>cylinder</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The E.R. Thomas Motor Company built {{automobiles}} from 1902 to 1919. The first Models {{were the}} 1902 Model 17, this {{was available in}} either a detachable rear entrance tonneau or runabout, equipped with a single cylinder 8hp and 2 speed plantery transmission. This was followed in January 1903 by the Model 18 with its sliding selective transmission and non-detachable Tonneau with rear entrance or runabout body styles. Both the Model 17 and 18 sold side by side until stocks of the Model 17 were sold out in April-May 1903. The 1904 Thomas was the first Thomas to bear the [...] "Flyer" [...] name a touring car model {{and was the first}} multi <b>cylinder</b> <b>vehicle</b> produced by the firm. It was a 3 cylinder with plantery transmission on the earlier cars late change to the trans axle transmission that would continue for many years. Equipped with a tonneau, it could seat 5 passengers and sold for US$2500. The vertically mounted water-cooled straight-3, situated {{at the front of the}} car, produced 24 hp (17.9 kW). The steel-framed car weighed 1900 lb (862 kg). A modern cellular radiator was used for cooling. An 8 hp (6 kW) tonneau model sold for US$1250. In 1912 the company went into receivership and was purchased by Empire Smelting & Refining Company owner C.A. Finnegan. E.R. Thomas was finally shut down between 1918 and 1919.|$|E

40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{model of a}} vehicle exiting the water surface obliquely has been analyzed. The analyzed object is a <b>cylinder</b> <b>vehicle</b> and its motion characteristics. Two methods {{have been used to}} simulate the water-exit process under the same conditions: Numerical Simulation Method (NSM) and Theoretical Model Solution Method (TMSM). The comparison results of the two methods can validate the {{hydrodynamic model}} founded in this paper. Different initial angles and different initial velocities have been simulated by this hydrodynamic model and the numerical simulation has been analyzed. The analysis reveals the rule of change of altitude and position of the vehicle in the water-exit process, and its motion after it exits the water surface. This paper explains why it is more difficult for the vehicle to exit the water obliquely than vertically. The results show that the hydrodynamic model of the water exiting vehicle can be used to research the exiting water motion characteristics. The models simulate the physics of motion realistically and this hydrodynamic model {{can be used as a}} foundation for the future research of the stability and control of a vehicle exiting the water...|$|E

5000|$|Dune buggy- popular {{method of}} {{building}} a dune buggy involves construction of a vehicle frame from steel tubing formed and welded together. The advantage of this method is that the fabricator can change fundamental parts of the vehicle (usually the suspension and addition of a built-in roll cage).

Sizes can vary from a small engined one seat size to 4 seat, 8+ <b>cylinder</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Sandrails can have panels or custom shaped body coverings over the rails and tubing that comprise the vehicle, though many are left bare.|$|R

50|$|In a four-wheel car, the FMVSS Standard 105, 1976; {{requires}} that the master cylinder be divided internally into two sections, each of which pressurizes a separate hydraulic circuit.

The combination {{is known as a}} dual master <b>cylinder.</b> Passenger <b>vehicles</b> typically have either a front/rear split brake system or a diagonal split brake system (the master cylinder in a motorcycle or scooter may only pressurize a single unit, which will be the front brake).|$|R
50|$|Bellcranks {{are also}} seen in {{automotive}} applications, {{as part of}} the linkage connecting the throttle pedal to the carburetor, and connecting the brake pedal to the master brake <b>cylinder.</b> In <b>vehicle</b> suspensions, bellcranks are used in pushrod-style suspensions in automobiles or in the Christie suspension in tanks.

50|$|In its {{simplest}} form, {{the automatic}} vacuum brake {{consists of a}} continuous pipe—the train pipe—running throughout {{the length of the}} train. In normal running a partial vacuum is maintained in the train pipe, and the brakes are released.

5000|$|The first {{involves}} {{alteration of}} an existing vehicle, most notably the original car or chassis, often a Volkswagen Beetle or a purpose-built chassis. The model is nicknamed Bug, therefore the term [...] "buggy". The Beetle automobile platform is preferred {{for a variety of}} reasons. Most significant is the position of the rear mounted Volkswagen engine, which with removal of bodywork transfers a high proportion of the weight to the rear driven wheels for extra traction. The engine is air cooled, simplifying engine modification, and the absence of a radiator and liquid-cooling system eliminates multiple sources of failure. The low price, robustness of the front suspension, and the sizable quantity of spare parts from other VW Beetles and Type 2 (Microbus) are a further advantage. Chevrolet Corvair engines are also a way to upgrade to 6 <b>cylinders</b> and sometimes <b>vehicles</b> are fitted with turbochargers.|$|R

The system developed in this research includes steering control computer, data acquisition pad, PWM driver, electrohydraulic proportional valve, hydraulic steering <b>cylinder</b> and <b>vehicle</b> steer angle sensor. Electrohydraulic proportional valve in the system has inherent dead-band and saturation. Dead-band influences steering accuracy very much.

It receives steering command signal from a machine vision system. It also can receive steering command signal (sine wave, triangle wave and step signal) generated by computer. The test road conditions include paved cement road and farm field.
