60|$|Sam {{passed him}} with a cold face and hurried through the door leading to the <b>companion-way.</b>|$|E
60|$|He dived out {{of sight}} just as Voules came up the <b>companion-way,</b> {{carrying}} a letter on a tray.|$|E
60|$|She turned away, and I {{walked by}} her side in silence. When she reached the <b>companion-way,</b> she stepped inside a little abruptly.|$|E
60|$|She {{was almost}} too {{surprised}} to answer him coherently, but she faltered out something about an unexpected journey. Afterwards, {{on the way to}} her stateroom, she overtook him near one of the <b>companion-ways,</b> and laid her hand upon his arm.|$|R
60|$|Shirley was a brave man, {{but as he}} {{lay awake}} in his bunk that night, cold shivers ran down his back many times. If {{violence}} were offered to him, of course he could not make any defence, but he was resolved that if an attack should be made upon him, {{there was one thing}} he would try to do. He had carefully noted the location of the <b>companion-ways,</b> and he had taken off only such clothes as would interfere with swimming. If he were attacked, he would make a bolt for the upper deck, and then overboard. If the yacht should be near enough to hear or see him, he might have a chance. If not, he would prefer the ocean to the Dunkery Beacon and her crew.|$|R
6000|$|... "Klick! Klick!" [...] {{he urged}} {{grasping}} {{her by the}} arm--half leading, half dragging her toward the <b>companion-way.</b> [...] "Plilates! Mlalay plilates--Dyak plilates." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bob {{emerged from}} the <b>companion-way</b> as the {{schooner}} swung around to her cable, {{and a man who}} was standing near the wheel shouted: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; very." [...] She had {{withdrawn}} her eyes, {{and was looking}} vaguely towards the <b>companion-way.</b> [...] "Everybody has been so kind to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Any of you fellows got a Bible or Prayer-book?” was the captain’s next demand, {{this time}} of the hunters {{lounging}} about the <b>companion-way.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{put down}} her book and left, the mate {{watching}} her until she disappeared down the <b>companion-way.</b> Then {{he sat down and}} waited.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll go too: but don't let's {{venture out}} of the <b>companion-way,</b> for the waves must be making a clean sweep over the decks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are they comin' this way?" [...] {{the captain}} demanded, {{screaming}} until {{his face was}} crimson, and Bill Jepson suddenly dropped out of sight through the <b>companion-way.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "He does, and is--he is standing, at this moment, on the {{larboard}} {{side of the}} <b>companion-way,</b> kneeling one knee, on {{the forward}} end of the hen-coop." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Clear enough,” I answered, {{glancing at}} the {{sunshine}} which streamed down the open <b>companion-way.</b> “Fair westerly breeze, with a promise of stiffening, if Louis predicts correctly.” ...|$|E
60|$|We sprang {{together}} for the ladder, but I raced past her to the deck. A dense volume of smoke was pouring out of the steerage <b>companion-way.</b>|$|E
6000|$|There were {{no sign of}} life on deck; but as we {{went over}} the rail the <b>companion-way</b> hatch was opened a few inches, and some one cried: ...|$|E
6000|$|Darius had {{his head}} out of the <b>companion-way</b> before it was {{possible}} for me to get on my feet, and I heard a strange voice cry sharply: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They've locked us in here so's {{they can}} steal the Bonita!" [...] Bob shouted, as he leaped to the <b>companion-way</b> and began {{pounding}} on the bolted doors.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{should we}} fight," [...] he asked. [...] "Against such fearful odds? There is another way--a better way. Look!" [...] He {{pointed toward the}} <b>companion-way</b> that led below deck.|$|E
60|$|As Mulford saw all {{was well}} in the cabin, he hastened on deck, {{followed}} by Se¤or Montefalderon. Just as they emerged from the <b>companion-way,</b> Spike was hailing the forecastle.|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't know {{anything}} about it, and {{do not intend to}} look!" [...] Harry said decidedly, as he retreated toward the <b>companion-way,</b> taking up his stand directly in front of Walter.|$|E
6000|$|Then the {{commodore}} arose to {{his feet}} in token that the interview was at an end, and we lads went out, Joshua Barney saying to Darius as he went up the <b>companion-way</b> stairs: ...|$|E
60|$|They were {{securely}} imprisoned, for {{the cabin}} had no outlet {{except at the}} <b>companion-way,</b> {{and two or three}} hours of hard work would be absolutely necessary before they could escape by the doors.|$|E
60|$|Three {{times did}} the mate, in {{response}} to the frenzied commands of the skipper, come stealthily up the <b>companion-way</b> and look at him. Time was passing and action of some kind was imperative.|$|E
6000|$|Not {{a member}} of our party spoke until we descended the <b>companion-way</b> stairs, and faced the lads and my father, who had lighted a candle as a sort of welcome, and then Darius exclaimed: ...|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps {{the same}} {{syllable}} sent Jim's thoughts straying {{in a similar}} direction, for he began to whistle once more, and continued to do so until {{a voice from the}} <b>companion-way</b> asked, in a querulous tone: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ted Sawyer 'as {{been telling}} {{everybody}} that I {{came up the}} <b>companion-way</b> like a fog-horn that 'ad lost its ma; I wonder how he'd 'ave come up if he'd 'ad the evening I had 'ad? ...|$|E
60|$|He ceased {{speaking}} very suddenly, {{for just}} at that moment a footstep was heard on the steamer's deck, and an instant later the unpleasant-looking face of {{the man with the}} red nose appeared at the <b>companion-way.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Both {{men were}} working with the utmost speed, dashing water into the <b>companion-way,</b> and causing the smoke to rise in yet denser volumes. Only once did either speak, and then when Bob shouted in a hoarse voice: ...|$|E
60|$|When the {{commander}} arose to his feet, after settling {{the question as}} to whether we should be prepared to defend ourselves in case the occasion required, I started up the <b>companion-way</b> stairs, beckoning for Jerry to follow.|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes, sir;” and Thomas Mugridge fled swiftly aft and {{disappeared}} down another <b>companion-way</b> near the wheel. A {{moment later he}} emerged, a heavy-set young fellow of eighteen or nineteen, with a glowering, villainous countenance, trailing at his heels.|$|E
60|$|That the Mexican was a rank coward {{could be}} {{told by the}} pallor which came over his yellow face as these words were spoken, and with a muttered but inaudible reply he {{followed}} Dave to the <b>companion-way</b> ladder.|$|E
60|$|The {{first that}} fell was Mr. Lewis, the ship's clerk. He was leaning, with folded arms, over a bale of blankets, engaged in bargaining, when he {{received}} a deadly stab in the back, and fell down the <b>companion-way.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{lower deck}} had burst through, {{and there was}} no more than time for Jake and his assistants to clamber up the ladders before the flames had {{complete}} possession of the yacht from the bow to the engine-room <b>companion-way.</b>|$|E
60|$|Promising {{himself that}} he would re-stow the goods on the gig, putting his father's with those {{belonging}} to himself and Teddy, {{as soon as this}} message had been delivered, he descended the <b>companion-way</b> after glancing rapidly around the horizon.|$|E
60|$|Neal {{could not}} trust himself to speak. Ascending the <b>companion-way</b> rapidly he {{approached}} his {{father who was}} conversing with Mr. Walters near the bow, as if that position had been chosen to prevent the crew from hearing what was said.|$|E
