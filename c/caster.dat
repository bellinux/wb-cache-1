5|$|In 2011, Kooijman, et al., {{published}} an article in Science showing that neither gyroscopic effects nor so-called <b>caster</b> effects due to trail are necessary for a bike to balance itself. They designed a two-mass-skate bicycle that the equations of motion predict is self-stable even with negative trail, the front wheel contacts {{the ground in front}} of the steering axis, and with counter-rotating wheels to cancel any gyroscopic effects. Then they constructed a physical model to validate that prediction. This may require some of the details provided below about steering geometry or stability to be re-evaluated. Bicycle dynamics was named 26 of Discovers 100 top stories of 2011.|$|E
5|$|Paula Kamen, {{author of}} Her Way: Young Women Remake the Sexual Revolution, placed the {{increasing}} {{popularity of the}} Magic Wand as an influential factor in the sexual revolution which took place {{towards the end of}} the 20th century. Cathy Winks and Anne Semans, coauthors of The Good Vibrations Guide to Sex, recommended the Magic Wand for use both during foreplay and intercourse and noted couples could feel pleasure through the device together at the same time. Wendy <b>Caster</b> wrote in the 2003 edition of The Lesbian Sex Book that lesbians have enjoyed using the Magic Wand due to its ability to concentrate powerful vibration on the clitoris.|$|E
2500|$|Swivel <b>casters</b> are {{commonly}} used on smaller wagons because of the flexible, [...] mobility they offer. As the number of swivel <b>casters</b> attached to a wagon increases, though, it becomes increasingly difficult to align them. Consequently, {{it may be difficult}} or impossible to move a wagon that has a large number of swivel <b>casters</b> when the <b>casters</b> are unaligned. As a result, rigid <b>casters</b> are preferred for larger wagons, which typically require a proportionally higher number of <b>casters.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Air <b>casters</b> are {{sometimes}} used {{in place of}} rolling <b>casters.</b> These require pressurized air to operate, which produces audible hiss that is undesirable in some situations, and are typically more expensive than rolling <b>casters,</b> but they {{have the advantage of}} [...] "locking" [...] the scenery securely in place when depressurized and, like swivel <b>casters,</b> they permit omnidirectional movement.|$|R

5|$|Special effects company Amalgamated Dynamics Incorporated (ADI) {{was hired}} for the movie, having {{previously}} worked on Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection. Visual special effects producers Arthur Windus and John Bruno {{were in charge}} of the project, which contained 400 effects shots. ADI founders Alec Gillis, Tom Woodruff Jr., and members of their company, began designing costumes, miniatures and effects in June 2003. For five months the creatures were redesigned, the Predators wrist blades being extended roughly four times longer than those in the Predator films, and a larger mechanical plasma <b>caster</b> was created for the Scar Predator.|$|E
5|$|The {{carriage}} {{was nearly}} identical to the carriage of the M-30. It had suspension and steel wheels with pneumatic rubber tires. The trails were initially of riveted construction, but were eventually replaced in production by welded ones. Late production pieces were equipped with <b>caster</b> wheels to ease manhandling. Time to set up for combat was about two minutes. In an emergency {{it was possible to}} fire without splitting trails; however this was at the price of a drastically reduced traverse (1°30'). Since the gun was not equipped with a limber, it could be towed only by vehicle. The maximum towing speed was 40km/h on paved roads, 30km/h on cobbled roads and 10km/h off-road. To give the crew some protection from bullets and shell fragments, the gun was fitted with a shield.|$|E
25|$|Various <b>caster</b> {{types are}} used on scenery wagons. The choice of <b>caster</b> type for any {{particular}} wagon {{depends on a}} number of factors, including platform size and shape, scenery weight, production aesthetics and budget. Typically, casters are mounted so that the bottom of the platform is elevated approximately one-half to three-quarters of an inch above the stage. The number of casters required for a wagon depends on <b>caster</b> type and load rating as well as the size, shape and weight of the wagon and scenery.|$|E

50|$|Because air <b>casters</b> are {{virtually}} friction-free, the force required {{to move them}} is very low, often around one to five lbs. per 1,000 lbs. of weight. Air <b>casters</b> are also omni-directional, meaning they move with equal ease in any direction.|$|R

50|$|<b>Casters</b> used in {{and around}} {{furnaces}} and ovens must withstand extreme heat. General purpose <b>casters</b> cannot survive excessive heat because tread materials, lubricants and other critical components can fail. For example, at 200 degrees F, common resilient tread materials are at or above their functional temperature limits. High temperature <b>casters</b> employ special lubricants and materials that can withstand higher heat. Additionally, for very high temperatures, special sleeve bearings may be used that have no lubricant whatsoever.|$|R

25|$|Pavlova is made {{by beating}} egg whites (and {{sometimes}} salt) to a very stiff consistency before folding in <b>caster</b> sugar, vinegar or another acid (e.g. cream of tartar or lemon juice), cornflour, and sometimes vanilla essence, and slow-baking the mixture, similar to meringue.|$|E
25|$|Steering angles {{are also}} crucial {{as the driver}} progresses. The first stage of these {{modifications}} is usually a modified steering knuckle or upright. Extended control arms can be employed on MacPherson strut vehicles like the Nissan S-Chassis, as to allow for more clearance for higher steering angles. Companies like Wisefab, IRP (Individual Racing Parts), Voodoo13, and Parts Shop MAX have developed full lock kits including modification of the vehicle's original scrub radius, kingpin axis, Ackermann angle, amount of bump steer, <b>caster</b> angle, and kinematics as to maximize front grip and eliminate mechanical bind at steering angles in excess of 60°. While MacPherson strut vehicles are prevalent in profession drifting, Double wishbone suspension vehicles can also be competitive, with often better <b>caster</b> and camber curves.|$|E

25|$|This gallery holds {{machinery}} {{from the}} last of the hot metal typesetting printshops as used in the newspaper industry. The monotype keyboard produces punched 31-level tape for casting on the monotype <b>caster.</b> The keyboard comprises seven QWERTY arrangements (Roman upper and lower case, bold upper and lower case, italic upper and lower case and SMALL CAPITALS). It is operated by compressed air and produces a wide paper tape that contains perforations that when transferred to the <b>caster</b> give full instructions for each character to be cast. The monotype system was widely used in the commercial printing sector. There is a forme (text lines produced on a Linotype typesetting machine) made up into {{the front page of the}} last edition of the Yorkshire Sports, 2 May 1981. The assembled forme is ready to be moulded and cast into a curved printing plate.|$|E
