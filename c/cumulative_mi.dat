40|$|MISTIC (mutual {{information}} server to infer coevolution) is a web server for graphical represen-tation {{of the information}} contained within a MSA (multiple sequence alignment) and a complete analysis tool for Mutual Information networks in protein families. The server outputs a graphical visu-alization of several information-related quantities using a circos representation. This provides an integrated view of the MSA in terms of (i) the mutual information (MI) between residue pairs, (ii) sequence conservation and (iii) the residue cumula-tive and proximity MI scores. Further, an interactive interface to explore and characterize the MI network is provided. Several tools are offered for selecting subsets of nodes from the network for visualization. Node coloring can be set to match different attri-butes, such as conservation, <b>cumulative</b> <b>MI,</b> proxim-ity MI and secondary structure. Finally, a zip file containing all results can be downloaded. The server is available a...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A large {{panel of}} methods exists that aim to {{identify}} residues with critical impact on protein function based on evolutionary signals, sequence and structure information. However, {{it is not}} clear to what extent these different methods overlap, and if any of the methods have higher predictive potential compared to others when it comes to, in particular, the identification of catalytic residues (CR) in proteins. Using a large set of enzymatic protein families and measures based on different evolutionary signals, we sought to break up the different components of the information content within a multiple sequence alignment to investigate their predictive potential and degree of overlap. Results Our results demonstrate that the different methods included in the benchmark in general can be divided into three groups with a limited mutual overlap. One group containing real-value Evolutionary Trace (rvET) methods and conservation, another containing mutual information (MI) methods, and the last containing methods designed explicitly for the identification of specificity determining positions (SDPs) : integer-value Evolutionary Trace (ivET), SDPfox, and XDET. In terms of prediction of CR, we find using a proximity score integrating structural information (as the sum of the scores of residues located within a given distance of the residue in question) that only the methods from the first two groups displayed a reliable performance. Next, we investigated to what degree proximity scores for conservation, rvET and <b>cumulative</b> <b>MI</b> (cMI) provide complementary information capable of improving the performance for CR identification. We found that integrating conservation with proximity scores for rvET and cMI achieved the highest performance. The proximity conservation score contained no complementary information when integrated with proximity rvET. Moreover, the signal from rvET provided only a limited gain in predictive performance when integrated with mutual information and conservation proximity scores. Combined, these observations demonstrate that the rvET and cMI scores add complementary information to the prediction system. Conclusions This work contributes {{to the understanding of the}} different signals of evolution and also shows that it is possible to improve the detection of catalytic residues by integrating structural and higher order sequence evolutionary information with sequence conservation. </p...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND. Radiation therapy (RT), a {{critical}} component of breast-conserving therapy for breast cancer, has been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in numerous older studies, but the risk may be lower with modern techniques. METHODS. Observed rates of cardiac events in 828 patients treated with breast-conserving surgery and RT at the University of Michigan were compared with expected rates. Relations between potential risk factors and actuarial rates of first CAD event were analyzed. RESULTS. Observed risks of cardiac events were lower than expected. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of myocardial infarction (MI) was 0. 44 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 21 – 0. 70). The SIR of MI or CAD requiring intervention was 0. 50 (95 % CI: 0. 27 – 0. 68). With a median follow-up of 6. 8 years, 12 (1. 4 %) patients had at least 1 MI on follow-up and 20 (2. 4 %) had at least 1 MI or CAD requiring intervention. Median age at first cardiac event was 75. 9 years (range, 43. 1 – 91. 5). Median interval from RT to occurrence of the first cardiac event was 3. 7 years (range, 13 days to 15. 4 years). The 10 -year <b>cumulative</b> incidence of <b>MI</b> was 1. 2 % and <b>cumulative</b> incidence of <b>MI</b> or CAD requiring intervention was 2. 7 %. On multivariate analysis, age, diabetes mellitus, active smoking, and laterality of RT were significant predictors of MI. Age and active smoking were significant predictors of MI or CAD requiring intervention. CONCLUSIONS. Patients in this series had lower risk of ischemic cardiac events than expected. Although small in absolute magnitude, patients radiated to the left side did have a statistically significant increased risk of MI. These findings support further investigation of techniques to minimize the long-term cardiac risks faced by breast cancer patients. Cancer 2007 © 2007 American Cancer Society...|$|R
40|$|Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays a {{significant}} role in apoptosis after myocardial infarction (MI) and reperfused <b>MI.</b> <b>Cumulative</b> evidence suggests that Ang II is a major contributor to cardiomyocyte (CM) apoptosis and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after acute reperfused MI and that apoptosis mediates a major portion of early LV dysfunction. Importantly, blockade of the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT 1 R) limits CM apoptosis and LV dysfunction after acute reperfused MI. Ang II type 2 receptor activation during AT 1 R blockade contributes to these beneficial effects. The role of Ang II and apoptosis in chronic LV remodelling, healing and post-MI heart failure is more complex and involves effects on the CMs, fibroblasts and vascular cells. The long-term effects of agents targeting apoptosis after reperfused MI, including AT 1 R blockade, on apoptosis in different cell types, windows of enhanced apoptosis and the appropriate timing of therapy need to be considered...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: Platelets express high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB 1), a damage-associated {{molecular}} pattern molecule (DAMP) that triggers thrombosis and inflammation when {{present in}} extracellular space. The role of platelet-derived HMGB 1 in {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) remains unexplored. Methods: In a cohort study, we measured the expression of HMGB 1 {{on the surface of}} circulating platelets in 183 patients with symptomatic CAD (stable CAD: n= 80, acute coronary syndrome, ACS: n= 103) at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention. All patients were tracked for course of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), all-cause death (ACD), and myocardial infarction (MI) for 360 days after study inclusion. Results: Platelet HMGB 1 expression did not significantly differ between stable CAD, unstable CAD, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Moreover, platelet HMGB 1 did not significantly correlate with LVEF, neither at baseline nor at 6 months follow-up of the MI subgroup, and did not exert any significant effect on outcome (composite of ACD and/or MI as well as single events ACD and <b>MI).</b> <b>Cumulative</b> event-free survival of patients was not significantly different between HMGB 1 levels above the median and HMGB 1 levels below or equal to the median. Conclusion: These findings suggest that HMGB 1 expressed on the surface of circulating platelets in patients with symptomatic CAD may not serve as a prognostic biomarker for this disease state...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{present the}} 5 -year {{clinical}} outcomes according to treatment strategy with additional risk stratification of the ICTUS (Invasive versus Conservative Treatment in Unstable coronary Syndromes) trial. BACKGROUND: Long-term outcomes may {{be relevant to}} decide treatment strategy for patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) and elevated troponin T. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1, 200 patients to an early invasive or selective invasive strategy. The outcomes were the composite of death or myocardial infarction (MI) and its individual components. Risk stratification was performed with the FRISC (Fast Revascularization in InStability in Coronary artery disease) risk score. RESULTS: At 5 -year follow-up, revascularization rates were 81 % in the early invasive and 60 % in the selective invasive group. <b>Cumulative</b> death or <b>MI</b> rates were 22. 3 % and 18. 1 %, respectively (hazard ratio [HR]: 1. 29, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 00 to 1. 66, p = 0. 053). No difference was observed in mortality (HR: 1. 13, 95 % CI: 0. 80 to 1. 60, p = 0. 49) or MI (HR: 1. 24, 95 % CI: 0. 90 to 1. 70, p = 0. 20). After risk stratification, no benefit of an early invasive strategy was observed in reducing death or spontaneous MI {{in any of the}} risk groups.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a technique for realizing a high-rank channel matrix in a line-of-sight (LOS) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission scenario. This is beneficial for systems which {{are unable to}} make use of the originally derived MIMO gain given by independent and identically distributed (i. i. d.) flat Rayleigh fading channels. Typical applications are fixed wireless access (FWA) and radio relay systems. The technique is based on optimization of antenna placement in uniform linear arrays with respect to mutual information (MI) for pure LOS channels. Both the case where the channel is only known at the receiver and the case where the channel is known at the transmitter and receiver are treated. By introducing a new and more general 3 -D geometrical model than that applied in earlier works, additional insight into the optimal design parameters is gained. We also perform a novel analysis of the sensitivity of the optimal design parameters, and derive analytical expressions for the eigenvalues in the pure LOS channel case, which are valid also when allowing for non-optimal design. Furthermore, we investigate the approximations introduced in the derivations, in order to reveal when the results are applicable, which turns out to be for most practical situations. The LOS transmission matrix is used in a Ricean fading channel model which incorporates spatial correlation between the non-LOS components, and performance is evaluated with respect to the average MI and the <b>MI</b> <b>cumulative</b> distribution function. Our results show that even with some deviation from the optimal design, the LOS MIMO scenario outperforms the i. i. d. Rayleigh scenario in terms of MI...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe study {{sought to}} test the {{hypothesis}} that genetic variation in ABCG 5 / 8, the transporter responsible for intestinal and hepatobiliary cholesterol efflux, may simultaneously influence plasma and biliary cholesterol levels, and hence risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and gallstone disease in opposite directions. BackgroundHigh plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol are a causal risk factor for MI, whereas high levels of biliary cholesterol promote gallstone formation. MethodsA total of 60, 239 subjects from Copenhagen were included, including 5, 647 with MI and 3, 174 with symptomatic gallstone disease. Subjects were genotyped for 6 common, nonsynonymous and functional variants in ABCG 5 / 8, and a combined weighted genotype score was calculated. ResultsCombined, weighted genotype scores were associated with stepwise decreases in LDL cholesterol of up to 5. 9 % (0. 20 mmol/l) for individuals with a score ≥ 8. 0 (prevalence = 11 %) versus < 2. 0 (prevalence = 9 %; p for trend across 5 groups = 2  × 10 E- 35). The <b>cumulative</b> incidences of <b>MI</b> and gallstone disease as a function of age and increasing genotype score were decreased and increased (log-rank ps for trend: 6 × 10 E- 4 and 9 × 10 E- 45), respectively. The multifactorially adjusted odds ratios were 0. 83 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 73 to 0. 94) for MI and 2. 85 (95 % confidence interval: 2. 39 to 3. 39) for symptomatic gallstone disease for individuals with a genotype score ≥ 8. 0 versus < 2. 0. ConclusionsGenetic variation in ABCG 5 / 8, which associates with decreased levels of plasma LDL cholesterol protects against MI, but increases the risk of symptomatic gallstone disease. These results suggest that MI and gallstones, 2  seemingly unrelated diseases, are intrinsically linked via the function of the ABCG 5 / 8 cholesterol transporter...|$|R
40|$|Abstract] Background: Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI) {{incidence and}} mortality display a high geographic variation. Aims: The {{objective of the}} present study was to analyze <b>MI</b> mortality, <b>cumulative</b> incidence rate variability in seven regions of Spain from 1997 to 1998. Methods and Results: Standardized methods were used to identify, find, register, and classify MI cases that were classified as definite, possible, insufficient-dataMI, and non-MI. The total population of the seven monitored regions was 7, 364, 682 inhabitants. Of the 11, 256 cases fulfilling eligibility criteria to investigate, 10, 660 were selected to calculate MI rates: 6554 (61. 5 %) non-fatal definite MI, 1179 (11. 1 %) fatal definite MI, 1859 (17. 4 %) fatal possible MI, 1068 (10. 0 %) fatal cases with insufficient data. The IBERICA 25 – 74 years age-standardized cumulative incidence rates for men and women, were 207 (range: 175 – 252) and 45 (range: 36 – 65) per 100, 000, respectively. The age-standardized mortality rates for men and women, were 73 (range: 62 – 94) and 20 (range: 13 – 29) per 100, 000, respectively. Age-standardized case-fatality was 31. 4 and 24. 2 % in men aged 25 – 74 and 35 – 64 years, respectively, and 32. 7 and 27. 0 %, respectively, in women.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{investigated}} the effectiveness {{and safety of}} drug-eluting stents (DES) as used in routine clinical practice. BackgroundRandomized trials have shown that DES prevent target vessel revascularization in selected patients, but whether this translates into superior outcomes, compared with bare-metal stents (BMS), for {{the full spectrum of}} patients treated with DES in North America is unknown. MethodsPatients in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Dynamic Registry enrolled in 2004 who received at least 1 DES (n = 1, 460) were compared with 1, 763 patients enrolled in the recruitment period immediately preceding the approval of DES (2001 to 2002) who received at least 1 BMS. ResultsPatients receiving DES more often had diabetes mellitus and less often presented with an acute myocardial infarction (MI). At 1 year, <b>cumulative</b> death and <b>MI</b> was 7. 6 % in DES- and 8. 7 % in BMS-treated patients (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0. 88, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 68 to 1. 15; p = 0. 34). The 1 -year rate of target vessel revascularization was 5. 0 % in DES and 9. 2 % in BMS patients (p < 0. 001), and the risk of any repeat revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary bypass was lower in DES patients (adjusted HR 0. 38, 95 % CI 0. 25 to 0. 60; p < 0. 001). Patients with both simple and complex lesion characteristics benefited from DES with lower risk of repeat target vessel revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention compared with BMS (any complex lesion: adjusted HR 0. 57, 95 % CI 0. 39 to 0. 83; absence of any complex lesion: adjusted HR 0. 44, 95 % CI 0. 28 to 0. 71). The 1 -year incidence of stent thrombosis was 1. 0 % in DES patients.

Background. Plaque rupture and platelet aggregation are pathogenetic processes common to unstable angina and ischemic complications of percutaneous coronary intervention. Methods. Of the 2, 099 patients undergoing a coronary intervention in the Evaluation of 7 E 3 in Preventing Ischemic Complications (EPIC) trial, 489 were enrolled with the diagnosis of unstable angina and randomized to receive placebo, an abciximab (c 7 E 3) bolus immediately before the intervention or an abciximab bolus followed by a 12 -h infusion. The primary end point was a composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI) or urgent repeat revascularization within 30 days of randomization. The occurrence of death, MI or any revascularization within 6 months was also assessed. Results. Compared with placebo, the bolus and infusion of abciximab resulted in a 62 % reduction {{in the rate of}} the primary end point (12. 8 % vs. 4. 8 %, p = 0. 012) among patients with unstable angina, due primarily to a reduction in the incidences of death (3. 2 % vs. 1. 2 %, p = 0. 164) and MI (9 % vs. 1. 8 %, p = 0. 004). By 6 months, <b>cumulative</b> death and <b>MI</b> were further reduced by abciximab (6. 6 % vs. 1. 8 %, p = 0. 018 and 11. 1 % vs. 2. 4 %, p = 0. 002, respectively). The magnitude of the risk reduction with abciximab was greater among the patients with unstable angina than among other patients in the EPIC trial without unstable angina for the end points of death (interaction: p = 0. 008 at 30 days, p = 0. 002 at 6 months) and MI (interaction: p = 0. 004 at 30 days, p = 0. 003 at 6 months). Conclusions. The syndrome of unstable angina identifies patients who will experience particularly marked reductions in the risk of death and MI with abciximab during coronary intervention.
