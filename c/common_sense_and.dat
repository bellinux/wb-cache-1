5|$|The English law legal system, {{developed}} over the centuries, {{is the basis of}} common law legal systems used in most Commonwealth countries and the United States (except Louisiana). Despite now being part of the United Kingdom, the legal system of the Courts of England and Wales continued, under the Treaty of Union, as a separate legal system from the one used in Scotland. The general essence of English law is that it is made by judges sitting in courts, applying their <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> knowledge of legal precedent—stare decisis—to the facts before them.|$|E
5|$|A plain {{soldier and}} {{business}} man. I am no politician, nor have I {{any desire to}} be one. In {{the course of my}} commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. What I have seen in the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by {{the vast majority of the}} population.|$|E
5|$|During the 1890s, Harvard Law School was {{pioneering}} the casebook {{method of}} teaching introduced by Dean Christopher Langdell. Apart from Langdell, Hand's professors included Samuel Williston, John Chipman Gray, and James Barr Ames. Hand preferred those teachers who valued <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> fairness, and ventured beyond casebook study into {{the philosophy of}} law. His favorite professor was James Bradley Thayer, who taught him evidence {{in his second year}} and constitutional law in his third. A man of broad interests, Thayer became a major influence on Hand's jurisprudence. He emphasized the law's historical and human dimensions rather than its certainties and extremes. He stressed the need for courts to exercise judicial restraint in deciding social issues.|$|E

25|$|No {{woman in}} recent time has {{combined}} her qualities – her taste for arduous and dangerous adventure with her scientific interest and knowledge, her competence in archaeology and art, her distinguished literary gift, her sympathy {{for all sorts}} and condition of men, her political insight and appreciation of human values, her masculine vigour, hard <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> practical efficiency– all tempered by feminine charm and a most romantic spirit.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{presentation}} is not to elaborate {{on the meaning of}} the <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> thinking <b>and</b> <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> in relation to cognition sensu stricto that is, in relation to scientific cognition. This topic has already been sufficiently covered in a concise and synchronous way. The focus of this presentation is mainly on selective manifestations of <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> thinking <b>and</b> their penetration of the philosophy in general, as well as the philosophy of sport in particular...|$|R
50|$|Other {{than that}} he is known for {{propagating}} the view that <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> philosophy <b>and</b> ordinary language philosophy are the same. He was generally supportive of Moore's theory of knowledge and certitude, though he found Moore's style and method of arguing to be ineffective. His critique of Moore's articles on skepticism (and also on Moore's 'Here is a hand' argument) {{lay the foundation for}} the renewed interest in <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> philosophy <b>and</b> ordinary language philosophy.|$|R
25|$|Moral suasion has {{sometimes}} been effective in resolving religious disharmony, especially if the Government is actively involved as a mediator. Moral suasion has been effective in Singapore {{in the creation of}} religious harmony among different religious groups. When conflicts do arise, the Government of Singapore's approach is to mediate or resolve the issue through <b>common</b> <b>sense,</b> <b>and</b> moral suasion using the collective efforts of the community, grassroots and religious leaders.|$|E
25|$|In {{determining}} {{which of these}} approaches to use, the valuation professional must exercise discretion. Each technique has advantages and drawbacks, which must be considered when applying those techniques to a particular subject company. Most treatises and court decisions encourage the valuator to consider more than one technique, which must be reconciled {{with each other to}} arrive at a value conclusion. A measure of <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> a good grasp of mathematics is helpful.|$|E
25|$|Like Di Bawah Lindungan Ka'bah (Under the Protection of Ka'bah; 1938) before it, Van der Wijck is {{critical}} of Minang adat (traditions), such as the treatment of persons of mixed descent {{and the role of}} women, an issue shown through Hayati's work to be an ideal wife despite Aziz mistreating her. Hamka found some traditions incompatible with the tenets of Islam and <b>common</b> <b>sense.</b> <b>and</b> continued to criticise adat in his works.|$|E
40|$|An {{expert system}} is a {{computer}} program intended to embody the knowledge and ability of an expert in a certain domain. The ideas behind them and several examples have been described in other lectures in this symposium. Their performance in their specialized domains are often very impressive. Nevertheless, hardly any of them have certain <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> knowledge <b>and</b> ability possessed by any non-feeble-minded human. This lack makes them “brittle”. By this is meant that they are difficult to extend beyond the scope originally contemplated by their designers, and they usually don’t recognize their own limitations. Many important applications will require <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> abilities. The object of this lecture is to describe <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> abilities <b>and</b> the problems that require them. <b>Common</b> <b>sense</b> facts <b>and</b> methods are only very partially understood today, and extending this understanding is the key problem facing artificial intelligence...|$|R

25|$|In {{contrary}} to her fearful demeanor, Bella, according to Edward in Midnight Sun, has {{no sense of}} fear when she finds out Edward is a vampire. Instead of running away, as she should have, she decides to ask lots of questions with extreme curiosity. This makes Edward {{believe that it is}} not bad luck that follows her around, but that she has no sense of self-preservation. Bella isn't very rational nor sensible as she lacks <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> street intelligence.|$|E
25|$|According to him, {{the problem}} of having {{political}} party undertook by <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> people. In other word Islam has not definite opinion on parties. Islam placed the duty of having party {{on the shoulders of}} peoples themselves. Islam has not any disagreement with partition. He believes that all parties before Islamic revolution in Iran controlled by Shah Regime and there was no original party in that time. In fact with victory of Islamic revolution, the existence of part becomes necessary for revolution.|$|E
25|$|Pippi is the {{daughter}} of a South Seas seafarer Ephraim Longstocking, captain of the sailing ship Hoptoad (Hoppetossa in Swedish), from whom Pippi inherited her <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> incredible strength. Captain Longstocking is the only person known to match Pippi in physical ability. He originally bought Villa Villekulla to give his daughter a more stable home life than that on board the ship, although Pippi loves the seafaring life and is a better sailor and helmsman than most of her father's crew.|$|E

40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>sense</b> cannot <b>and</b> {{must not}} {{serve as the basis}} for {{professional}} prac-tice, argues Haberman. Indeed, some <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> is nonsense; <b>and</b> some teachers who are well-educated and well-intentioned, but professionally un-trained, are counterproductive in their efforts to foster student learning. The author describes the fallacy of basing teaching practices solely on <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> principles. He further asserts the need for teacher educators to make sig-nificant improvements in present teacher preparation programs...|$|R
25|$|The Revolutionary period also {{contained}} political writings, including those by colonists Samuel Adams, Josiah Quincy, John Dickinson, and Joseph Galloway, the last being a loyalist to the crown. Two key figures were Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Paine. Franklin's Poor Richard's Almanac and The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin are esteemed works with their wit and influence toward {{the formation of}} a budding American identity. Paine's pamphlet <b>Common</b> <b>Sense</b> <b>and</b> The American Crisis writings are seen as playing a key role in influencing the political tone of the time.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{has shown}} that jurors {{typically}} take their roles very seriously. According to Simon (1980), jurors approach their responsibilities as decision makers much {{in the same way}} as a court judge – with great seriousness, a lawful mind, and a concern for consistency that is evidence-based. By actively processing evidence, making inferences, using <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> personal experiences to inform their decision-making, research has indicated that jurors are effective decision makers that seek thorough understanding, rather than passive, apathetic participants unfit to serve on a jury.|$|E
25|$|The first {{ancestors}} of fish, or animals that were probably {{closely related to}} fish, were Pikaia, Haikouichthys and Myllokunmingia. These three genera all appeared around 530 Ma. Pikaia had a primitive notochord, a structure that could have developed into a vertebral column later. Unlike the other fauna that dominated the Cambrian, these groups had the basic vertebrate body plan: a notochord, rudimentary vertebrae, and a well-defined head and tail. All of these early vertebrates lacked jaws in the <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> relied on filter feeding close to the seabed.|$|E

25|$|Keiron Self (2002–11) portrays Roger Bailey. Roger is the over-enthusiastic dentist {{who works}} in the same {{building}} as Ben. He often turns up at the Harper household uninvited and proceeds to unintentionally annoy Ben. For a long period Roger was trying to build up the courage to ask Abi out. They were, after all, ideally suited – like Abi, Roger possesses no <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> is gullible. Eventually they did marry but have since split as Abi has decided to become a nun. He's now a part-time policeman as well a dentist.|$|E
25|$|Lead dogs {{steer the}} rest of the team and set the pace. Leaders may be single or double; the latter is more common now, though single leaders used to be more common during the mid-20th century. Sometimes a leader may be unhitched (a loose or free leader) to find the trail for {{the rest of}} the team, but the {{practice}} is uncommon and is not allowed at races. Qualities for a good lead dog are intelligence, initiative, <b>common</b> <b>sense,</b> <b>and</b> the ability to find a trail in bad conditions.|$|E

After Carol runs off to join the rodeo, Wendy is left with Jodie, triggering a custody battle and a kidnapping. The series ends with Jodie believing himself {{to be an old}} Jewish man, Julius Kassendorf, due to a failed hypnotherapy session.|$|E
