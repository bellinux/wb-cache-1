25|$|In {{a typical}} example, the {{breeding}} box has concrete sides, soil with earthworms (to cleanse the soil) on the bottom, vegetation, curved tiles to provide shelter, feeders, and a <b>chicken</b> <b>waterer.</b> Mosquito netting or screening covers the top. These breeding boxes may be outside, or better {{results may be}} obtained when the boxes are inside a greenhouseâ€”as long as the greenhouse does not get too hot or too dry. One researcher reported that in outdoor boxes, each breeder snail had about seven young. In greenhouses, each breeder snail had about 9 to 12 young. The researcher felt that under better weather conditions than those he had that year, each adult breeder snail would have produced 15 young snails.|$|E
25|$|Be sure to {{frequently}} {{clean the}} feed and water dishes. The {{amount of feed}} a snail eats depends very much on air humidity and {{on the availability of}} drinking water. Clean drinking water can be served in a shallow container {{to reduce the risk of}} the snail drowning. Some types of <b>chicken</b> <b>waterers</b> may be suitable. Other factors (e.g., temperature, light intensity, food preferences versus food supplied, etc.) also affect feeding. A compromise, until the optimum feed is found, is to feed half green vegetable material and half chicken feed/grain/animal protein.|$|R
50|$|A {{chicken coop}} is a housing where {{chickens}} are kept or free range chickens return at dusk. Inside there will often be nest boxes for egg laying along with perches {{on which the}} birds can sleep. Additional material, like hay or pine chips, {{can be added to}} make cleaning the coop easier and provide insulation during the winter. Backyard coops are small and fenced, often with chicken wire, allowing chickens an area to roam, peck and hunt insects. Chicken tractors are floorless coops which can be dragged about a yard. Some backyard chickens are allowed to free range, and sleep in coops. Urban chicken keeping has led to manufactured chicken coops such as the Eglu, which are designed for tight spaces and have a tidy look. <b>Chicken</b> <b>waterers</b> and feeders {{are an important part of}} keeping chickens as pets. There are hanging waterers/feeders, nipple waterers and waterer cups. When creating a home for their flocks, owners should plan on a specific amount of coop space and roosting space, nest boxes, food and water for the number of birds in their flock and also select breeds with an eye towards how many eggs they wish to harvest.|$|R
5000|$|Tyler Phillips and Diana Samata {{started the}} {{business}} in Potomac, Maryland, in early 2012 with less than $50 by using salvaged wood, hinges and relatives' tools to make their first chicken coop.Phillips and Samata opened their second location in Flemington, NJ in 2014. In June 2014, the business had 70 chicken coops on rent and incubators with customers. RentACoop rents 2 chickens, a coop on wheels, organic feed and bedding to customers for 4 week periods. They also rent an incubator with 7 fertile eggs, two 1 week old chicks, feed, bedding, a brooder, heat lamp and a water and feeder bowl for 4 week periods. At {{the end of their}} educational 4 week programs, all of the chickens return back to RentACoop's home farms (Germantown MD and Flemington NJ. With RentACoop's years of testing every waterer and feeder on the market, RentACoop began manufacturing their own line <b>chicken</b> feeders and <b>waterers</b> in 2014. These feeders and waterers have gained national attention [...] for their innovativeness and are top sellers on Amazon.com.|$|R
