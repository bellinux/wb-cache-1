5|$|A {{film crew}} led by {{producer}} Gene Corman – linked to ABC – did eventually arrive to film proceedings, {{but within a}} day of their arrival the remaining Beatles had left; Upon returning to England, Lennon dismissed {{the idea that the}} presence of the film <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> contributed to the timing of their exit.|$|E
50|$|The yacht {{club with}} the most {{inscriptions}} is Kerteminde Sejlklub, with 17, and most individual wins have Danish Erik Andreasen, with 6.

5|$|Amazon {{lost three}} in the battle and six in her wreck, with 15 wounded, while Indefatigable did not lose a single man killed, {{suffering}} only 18wounded. The discrepancy in losses during the action is likely due to the extreme difficulty the French <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> in aiming their guns given their ship's instability in heavy seas.|$|E
5|$|At 05:37 {{an enemy}} contact report was made, and course {{was changed to}} {{starboard}} to close range. Neither ship was in good fighting trim. Hood, designed twenty-five years earlier, lacked adequate decking armour {{and would have to}} close the range quickly, as she would become progressively less vulnerable to plunging shellfire at shorter ranges. She had completed an overhaul in March and her <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> not been adequately retrained. Prince of Wales, with thicker armour, was less vulnerable to 15-inch shells at ranges greater than , but her <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> also not been trained to battle efficiency. The British ships made their last course change at 05:49, but they had made their approach too fine (the German ships were only 30 degrees on the starboard bow) and their aft turrets could not fire. Prinz Eugen, with Bismarck , had Prince of Wales and Hood slightly forward of the beam, and both ships could deliver full broadsides.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{existing}} airstrip at Turatam near the cosmodrome was small, {{the dogs and}} <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> to be first flown aboard a Tu-104 plane to Tashkent. From there, a smaller and lighter Il-14 plane took them to Turatam. Training of dogs continued upon arrival; one after another they {{were placed in the}} capsules to get familiar with the feeding system.|$|E

5|$|On 13 July U-255 {{found the}} 7,168 ton Dutch {{merchant}} ship Paulus Potter abandoned and drifting, with 2,250 tons of general goods, ammunition, 34 tanks, 15 aircraft and 103 trucks aboard. The ship {{had been attacked}} by Ju 88 dive bombers of III./KG 30 east-north-east of Bear Island on 5 July, the day after Convoy PQ 17 dispersed. The <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> abandoned the badly damaged ship, believing {{it was about to}} sink. All 76 of the <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> taken five days to reach land at Novaya Zemlya, eventually being rescued by a Soviet whaling vessel. After finding her the II.WO and two mates from U-255 boarded the ship, and attempted to start the engines, but the engine room was flooded. They then searched the vessel, taking blankets, cigarettes, and other useful materials, including confidential documents found on the bridge, and the ship's ensign as a prize, before the ship was sunk with a single torpedo. U-255 returned to Narvik on 15 July.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} 150years, other expeditions, explorers, and {{scientists}} would piece together what happened next. Franklin's men wintered in 1845–46 on Beechey Island, where three crew members died and were buried. Terror and Erebus became trapped in ice off King William Island in September 1846 and never sailed again. According to a note dated 25 April 1848, and {{left on the}} island by Fitzjames and Crozier, Franklin had died on 11 June 1847; the <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> wintered on King William Island in 1846–47 and 1847–48, and the remaining <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> planned to begin walking on 26 April 1848 toward the Back River on the Canadian mainland. Nine officers and fifteen men had already died; the rest would die along the way, most {{on the island and}} another 30 or 40 on the northern coast of the mainland, hundreds of miles from the nearest outpost of Western civilization.|$|E

Scott used eight sound stages for filming, including the 007 Stage. Studio space was limited and the <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> to make five stages work for approximately 16 sets, and increased {{the size of the}} 007 stage by over 30%.|$|E

5|$|The Hong Kong-route {{was officially}} opened on 5 August 1949. Braathens SAFE had then moved its {{operative}} base from Gardermoen to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The company stationed technical employees in Rome, Karachi, Bangkok and Hong Kong, {{as well as}} having an agreement with KLM. The planes would stop each night and crew and passengers would stay at a hotel. Cabin <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> no training, and learned the job as they worked. Chicken {{was the most common}} lunch meal, and the cabin <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> to purchase this fresh each day, usually observing the slaughter to ensure its freshness. In 1949, sixty-seven flights were made to Hong Kong, as well as two to Tokyo, to Venezuela and one to Johannesburg.|$|E
5|$|The TSB {{concluded}} {{that even if}} the <b>crew</b> <b>had</b> been aware {{of the nature of the}} problem immediately after detection of the initial odor, and had commenced an approach as rapidly as possible, the developing fire-related conditions in the cockpit would have made a safe landing at Halifax impossible.|$|E
