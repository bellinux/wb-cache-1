5|$|Sociology is the {{scientific}} study of society, including patterns of social relationships, social interaction, and culture. It is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and <b>critical</b> <b>analysis</b> to develop a body of knowledge about social order, acceptance, and change. Many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter ranges from the micro-sociology level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the social structure.|$|E

40|$|The {{last couple}} of years have seen an {{increasing}} interest in <b>critical</b> loss <b>analysis,</b> both, in academia and in practice. This development is documented by various research papers, high-level exchanges between antitrust experts as well as an increasing number of case decisions which make use of some form of <b>critical</b> loss <b>analysis.</b> In this context, it is the aim of this article to describe the general method of <b>critical</b> loss <b>analysis,</b> to assess important properties of the concept, to show how <b>critical</b> loss <b>analysis</b> has to differ between market definition exercises and the evaluation of the competitive effects of horizontal mergers and to discuss applications of <b>critical</b> loss <b>analysis</b> in recent cases. The results suggest that the application of <b>critical</b> loss <b>analysis</b> in practice is often not as straightforward as the rather simple theoretical concept might suggest. In fact, the method has to be applied with great care in order to receive meaningful results.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the concept of}} <b>critical</b> incident <b>analysis</b> in respect of improving the pedagogical practices in teaching dyslexic undergraduate biosciences students. <b>Critical</b> incident <b>analysis</b> is a well established pedagogical theory (Tripp, 1993) that allows reflection of a seemingly typical incident; the ‘critical incident’, so that changes and improvements can be implemented in teaching practices. In particular, it offers the opportunity to reflect upon these incidents and adopt different strategies by using the paradigms as described by Tripp and colleagues and uses these to foster improvement in teaching practice. However, the implementation of paradigms adopted by <b>critical</b> incident <b>analysis</b> and its reflective description in analysing an incident is currently lacking in undergraduate Bioscience. In view {{of the importance of}} <b>critical</b> incident <b>analysis,</b> here I describe the content and reflective pedagogical approaches adopted by <b>critical</b> incident <b>analysis</b> and incorporate its key principles into improving the methods and perception of teaching a dyslexic undergraduate student...|$|R
5|$|The Sopranos {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the greatest television series of all time. The series also won a multitude of awards, including Peabody Awards for its first two seasons, 21 Primetime Emmy Awards and five Golden Globe Awards. A staple of 2000s American popular culture, the series has been the subject of <b>critical</b> <b>analysis,</b> controversy, and parody. It has spawned books, , high-charting soundtrack albums, and a large amount of assorted merchandise. Several members of the show's cast and crew who were previously largely unknown to the public have had successful careers after The Sopranos. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America named The Sopranos the best-written TV series of all time, while TV Guide ranked it the best television series of all time.|$|E

Waldron elaborated on this criticism in his book The Harm in Hate Speech (2012), in which he devoted a chapter to Lewis' book. This prompted a <b>critical</b> <b>analysis</b> of both works in The New York Review of Books in June 2012 by former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens.|$|E
5|$|Though Haley is ostensibly a ghostwriter on the Autobiography, modern {{scholars}} tend {{to treat}} him as an essential and core collaborator who acted as an invisible figure {{in the composition of}} the work. He minimized his own voice, and signed a contract to limit his authorial discretion in favor of producing what looked like verbatim copy. However, MalcolmX biographer Manning Marable considers this view of Haley as simply a ghostwriter as a deliberate narrative construction of black scholars of the day who wanted to see the book as a singular creation of a dynamic leader and martyr. Marable argues that a <b>critical</b> <b>analysis</b> of the Autobiography, or the full relationship between MalcolmX and Haley, does not support this view; he describes it instead as a collaboration.|$|E

5|$|Because of his {{political}} connections and his mastery of French, McClellan received the assignment to be an official observer of the European armies in the Crimean War in 1855. Traveling widely, and interacting with the highest military commands and royal families, McClellan observed the siege of Sevastopol. Upon {{his return to the}} United States in 1856 he requested assignment in Philadelphia to prepare his report, which contained a <b>critical</b> <b>analysis</b> of the siege and a lengthy description of the organization of the European armies. He also wrote a manual on cavalry tactics that was based on Russian cavalry regulations. Like other observers, though, McClellan did not appreciate the importance of the emergence of rifled muskets in the Crimean War, and the fundamental changes in warfare tactics it would require.|$|E

40|$|As {{a teacher}} {{educator}} I consider myself {{an advocate for}} research-informed education, and strongly believe that it starts with one’s own <b>critical</b> self-reflection and <b>analysis</b> of one’s own teaching practice. <b>Critical</b> incident <b>analysis</b> is a pedagogical theory developed by Tripp (1993), whose analytical approaches allow reflection on teaching situations – ‘the critical incident’ – so that teachers can develop their professional judgments and practices. This article examines the concept of <b>critical</b> incident <b>analysis</b> through a teaching situation, {{with the aim of}} improving the teaching practice of students on teacher education programmes. I conclude that although <b>critical</b> incident <b>analysis</b> is a useful tool in navigating teaching practices, often challenges need to be addressed at much broader levels than the teaching context itself...|$|R

40|$|Using {{a survey}} of {{students}} from two national groups as an example, this paper shows how culture-contrastive research can be performed utilizing an extended version of the <b>critical</b> incident <b>analysis</b> (ECIA). Although it is a classic intercultural research instrument, the use of critical incidents can present methodological problems. Based on a study which was aimed at identifying communication barriers between German and Polish students at a cross-border university, an analysis method which combines traditional qualitative methods with <b>critical</b> incident <b>analysis</b> was created. The ECIA was developed {{as a response to}} the common criticisms of approaches based on <b>critical</b> incident <b>analysis.</b> By linking problem-centered interviews (WITZEL, 2000), the introduction of indicators, a codification of data, and expert opinions to <b>critical</b> incident <b>analysis,</b> the ECIA presents an application-oriented qualitative method that can be used to identify specific, relevant sources of problems in intercultural encounters.

40|$|<b>Critical</b> path <b>analysis</b> is a {{traditional}} way to study the parallelism of conservative parallel simulation. In this paper, we propose a new technique called state causality analysis to accurately model the conservative parallel network simulation. A theorem of simulation time advancement is presented and proved. Different from <b>critical</b> path <b>analysis,</b> our method focuses on the dependency of the logical process states instead of the unpredictable events. The effects of many algorithm-independent factors, such as lookahead, I/O overhead, physical transfer delay, processor speed and event distribution, are all taken into consideration. With this method, the complicated relations between parallel performance and the algorithm-independent factors can be revealed distinctly, which however cannot be revealed by <b>critical</b> path <b>analysis</b> in most cases. The theoretical analyses and experiments show that our method always predict a stricter upper bound {{on the performance of}} a given network simulation task than <b>critical</b> path <b>analysis,</b> which may provide a baseline to evaluate the conservative synchronization algorithms excluding the effects of algorithm-independent factors...|$|R
