40|$|The {{back-flow}} of an aortic valvo-pump will re-duce the pumping {{flow rate}} but can wash out {{the gap between}} the rotor and the stator, and thus can improve the antithrombogenicity of the de-vice. To investigate the regurgitation of a 23 mm OD aortic valvo-pump, its <b>closed</b> <b>impeller</b> was replaced by a cylinder and hereby the valvo- pump had lost its pumping function. The pres-sure head crossing the aortic valvo-pump was maintained by a locally made pulsatile centrifugal pump, beating rhythmically from 30 to 120 mmHg. The back flow from outlet to inlet of valvo-pump via the above-mentioned gap was measured. Results demonstrated that this gap and the pressure head had remarkable effect on back- flow; a larger gap and/or a larger pressure head would lead to a larger back-flow. By 0, 20 mm gap and 100 mmHg pressure head, the valvo-pump had ca. 0, 8 l/min back-flow. Instantaneous meas-urement indicated that the back-flow had a pul-satile form with high rate during diastole while low rate during systole of the natural heart imi-tated by pulsatile centrifugal pump. The pump rotated at 12500 rpm, 15000 rpm and 17500 rpm respectively, but it was found the rotating speed had no affection on back-flow. This investigation provides a basis for pump design seeking for both increase of the flow rate and improvement of the compatibility; the former is particularly important for a mini axial pump and the latter is extremely difficult for <b>closed</b> <b>impeller...</b>|$|E
40|$|LectureDirect Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) is an {{additive}} manufacturing process that utilizes a high-powered laser {{to build up}} a metal part by selectively melting thin layers of metal powder. This process is attractive for the manufacturing of parts with complex geometry such as closed centrifugal compressor impellers. DMLS allows closed impellers to be made in a single piece and eliminates the shroud joint that results from two-piece manufacturing processes. Using a monolithic impeller can allow higher tip speeds with improved fatigue characteristics compared with two-piece and three-piece designs. Prototype parts can be made more economically than investment casting when considering the tooling costs. Manufacturing costs for DMLS parts are marginally higher than for two-piece machined impellers, but qualification efforts for the braze/weld joint at the cover are circumvented. The DMLS process introduces several factors that must be considered in the impeller design to achieve a successful build with the proper strength and surface finish. This paper describes the authors? experience with manufacturing and testing multiple <b>closed</b> <b>impeller</b> designs constructed from Inconel 718, 17 - 4 PH Stainless Steel, and Titanium 6 Al- 4 V.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this PhD thesis is the {{development}} of an efficient system that can simultaneously pump and separate a gas-liquid mixture, in particular an oil-air mixture. Two-phase flows are encountered in many applications (petroleum extraction, flow in nuclear power plant pumps, pulp and paper processing, etc.) but this study is mainly focused on lubrication systems of aircraft gas turbine engines. The pump and separator system (PASS) for two-phase flows developed in this PhD thesis aims to perform three functions simultaneously: • Send back the oil to the tank (oil pumping) • Separate the air from the oil (de-aeration) • Separate the oil from the air (de-oiling) and release the sealing air into the atmosphere (venting). Particular care is given to the liquid flow rate lost at the gas outlet of the system. Consequently, it could replace the scavenge pumps and oil-air separators existing in present lubrication systems. This modification provides several advantages: simplification of the lubrication circuit, reduction of oil consumption and {{of the size of the}} lubrication system. This research is divided into three axes: the theoretical study of the important physical mechanisms taking place inside the two-phase flow pump and separator system, the experimental development, tests and optimization of different PASS prototypes, and also the numerical simulations of the two-phase flow inside these prototypes. Although the experiments were the central pillar of this research, the three axes were closely imbricated. The PASS design includes three main components: • An inlet chamber with one or several tangential inlets giving a natural centrifugation to the flow, • An impeller (forced centrifugation) with an axial and a radial part followed by a volute chamber, • A metallic foam that lets pass micron and sub-micron droplets and which is followed by an axial vent port. The centrifugation causes the liquid (oil) to move radially outwards in an annular body (a liquid ring) generating pressure. The thickness of this liquid ring inside the impeller is mainly determined by the pressure coefficient (related to the back-pressure and the rotational speed). When the back-pressure increases, the thickness of the liquid ring increases too. An advantage of the PASS is that it does not impose any relation between the liquid head and the liquid flow rate, contrary to common centrifugal pump. It self-regulates the radial position of the gas-liquid interface to sustain the operating conditions. The de-aeration efficiency mainly depends on the pressure coefficient (for a constant liquid viscosity or temperature) or on the thickness of the liquid ring. The pressure gradient which appears in the liquid rotating in an annular body acts like a dam for the gas phase. Indeed, the gas movement is mainly determined by the pressure field (buoyancy) while the liquid distribution is dominated by centrifugal and Coriolis forces. Buoyancy tends to accumulate the gas phase near low pressure areas (PASS hub, suction side of the blades, clearances between <b>closed</b> <b>impeller</b> and casing). The first oil-air PASS prototype produces high viscous losses due to the high peripheral velocity and liquid viscosity. Therefore, the pumping efficiency is poor compared to common impeller pumps. However, the pumping is not the key function of the PASS and a power consumption below 5 kW is acceptable for the application considered in this work. For applications that require lower power consumptions, a reduction of the rotational speed must be considered. Thus, the rotational speed and the impeller diameter are two major constraints for the PASS design which determine the de-aeration and pumping efficiencies. The impeller diameter also influences the size of passage sections for the air flow. The air velocity must be kept as low as possible because the entrainment of droplets increases when the air velocity rises (drag forces on droplets). Indeed, this large influence of the air flow rate on the oil consumption (de-oiling efficiency) was demonstrated by a theoretical analysis, the experiments and the CFD simulations. The production of droplets in the inlet pipes when the two-phase flow is annular is a key phenomenon regarding the oil consumption. In addition to the air flow rate, other variables also influence the oil consumption: • Air-oil temperature: when the temperature rises, the oil consumption increases because the surface tension and the oil density are reduced. Moreover, as the air density also decreases, the air velocity rises. • Oil flow rate: the oil consumption rises more or less linearly with the oil flow rate. However, the influence of the oil flow rate on the inlet droplet size is uncertain. • Rotational speed: the rotational speed has obviously a strong impact on the oil consumption without metallic foam. However, experiments showed that the metallic foam efficiency is almost independent on the rotational speed. Therefore, the oil consumption with the Retimet foam does not depend on the PASS rotational speed. • Altitude or air density: the oil consumption decreases when the air density is reduced because the drag forces on droplets also decrease. The gas density (altitude) is also supposed to influence the de-aeration efficiency but this could not be tested or simulated in this work (the de-aeration efficiency gets probably better when decreasing the gas density because the buoyancy forces increase). Theory, experiments and numerical simulations also allowed the prediction of performance of the first oil-air prototype for real in-flight operating conditions. Two problems have been identified: the de-aeration efficiency at MTO and cruise ratings and the oil leak throughout the vent in cold start and windmilling. To solve them, some modifications of the lubrication system have been suggested. With these modifications, the oil-air PASS should become very efficient and attractive for engine manufacturers.

The major differences {{with respect to the}} typical technologies used for high pressure machines are in the rotor design: Rotor stacked configuration with impellers connected through high precision toothed joint and a pre-stretched tie-rod; Shrouded and unshrouded impellers on a multistage between-bearings compressor; High peripheral speed journal and thrust bearings. The combination of unshrouded and shrouded impellers allows achieving same pressure ratio in a shorter bearing span, giving the possibility {{to increase the number of}} sections for each unit, making possible to reduce the number of casings. A full scale prototype has been built and tested to validate the new machine architecture. The prototype has been designed to fulfill a compression service made of three compression sections with a single unit; the same service could only be performed with at least two units if a standard compressor design was applied. The service requires serial compression of natural gas, characterized as follows: Design inlet volumetric flow close to 10800 m 3 /h; Design pressure ratio close to 30; Absorbed power~ 14 MW; Design speed of 17619 RPM (MCS = 18500 RPM, mos = 14095 RPM); First section comprises 2 open impellers; second section comprises 3 <b>closed</b> <b>impellers</b> and third section has 2 <b>closed</b> <b>impellers.</b> Impellers for first and second sections are in stacked configuration; third section?s impellers are mounted through shrink fitting.

These characteristics influence the static hydraulic forces encountered by the pump impeller, which determine the required load stiffness of suspension type bearings to minimize impeller touchdown. Performance investigations were conducted on an LVAD design while characterizing the impeller static hydraulic forces of various impeller/volute configurations. The pumps were inserted into a complete systemic and pulmonary mock circulation rig configured to provide suitable nonpulsatile or simulated pulsatile left heart failure environments. The single volute and <b>closed</b> shroud <b>impeller</b> configuration exhibited lowest radial (0. 01 N) and axial (3 N) force at nonpulsatile design flow conditions, respectively. Normal hemodynamic conditions of 5. 1 L/min at 94 mmHg were re-established upon inserting the device into the left heart failure environment, where the pump operated along the nonpulsatile characteristic curve for 2200 rpm. The operational limits on this curve were dictated by the required pressure differential across the pump during systolic and diastolic periods. The reduction of left atrial pressure (25 to 8 mmHg) indicated the alleviation of pulmonary congestion. The ability for the LVAD to support circulation in a left heart failure environment was successfully demonstrated in the mock circulation loop. The impeller hydraulic force characteristics attained will aid the bearing designer to select the best volute and impeller configuration to minimize impeller touchdown in magnetic, hydrodynamic or mechanical type bearing applications...|$|R

Phase-locked stereoscopic PIV measurements on three different vertical planes <b>close</b> to the <b>impeller</b> give phase-averaged mean flow on a cylindrical surface around the impeller. The scaling of q-averaged and plane-averaged radial, circumferential and axial mean velocity components is first explored. A theoretical model for the impeller-induced flow is used to extract the strength and size of the three dominant elements of the mean flow, namely the circumferential flow, the jet flow and the pairs of tip vortices. The scaling of these parameters with Reynolds number for the two different tanks is then obtained. The plane-averaged mean velocity scales with the blade tip velocity above a Reynolds number of about 15, 000. However, parameters associated with the jet and tip vortices do not become Reynolds number independence until Re exceeds about 105.

However, to date few papers are known of the rotordynamic fluid forces on open-type centrifugal impellers. This paper reports about experimental investigations of the rotordynamic fluid force moments on an open-type centrifugal compressor impeller in precessing motion. For open-type impellers, the variations of the tip clearance and the clearance between the back shroud and casing due to the precessing motion contribute to the rotordynamic fluid force moments. Experiments were conducted to measure the rotordynamic fluid force moments directly using the 4 -axis sensor, and the unsteady pressure on the front and back casing wall. In this paper, following results are obtained: (1) The fluid force moment becomes destabilizing in the region of negative precessing speed ratio (- 0. 3 <Ω/ω< 0), at the design flow rate; (2) At reduced flow rate, the destabilizing fluid force moments occurred at small positive precessing speed ratio (0. 2 <Ω/ω< 0. 4); (3) From the comparison of direct measured fluid force moments with those estimated from the unsteady pressure measured on the front and back casing walls, {{it was found that the}} destabilizing moments in the backward precession are mainly caused by the fluid forces on the front surface of the present impeller, where there is large clearance between the back shroud and casing...|$|R

The three-dimensional set-up facilitated an accurate velocity bias correction scheme and measurement of the full set of Reynolds stresses. Three-dimensional Laser-Doppler Anemometry (LDA) requires alignment of the six incident laser beams. To achieve accurate alignment a new, high resolution alignment system was developed. It consists of a small mirror, 50 fim in diameter, attached onto a sheet of glass and meets high demands concerning accuracy, time needed for alignment and water resistance. Due to strict demands on data validation, data rates were very low. To compensate for this as much as possible, several tests were carried out to optimize data quantity and quality. Velocity measurements were carried out in a dense grid in a vertical plane midway between two baffles. Velocity vector plots from three planes of view are presented and showed common features of the flow past Rushton impeller blades. The vorticity of the flow field was calculated to find the position of the core of the traihng vortices, which originate at the inner tips of the impeller blades. The Reynolds stress tensor was used to determine the rate of anisotropy of the turbulent flow according to the Lumley triangle. Turbulent flow in the vortex core tends to ID anisotropy. At larger radial distances and <b>close</b> to the <b>impeller</b> disc the fiow is more or less 3 D isotropic. Kramers Laboratorium voor Fysische TechnologieApplied Science...|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} been conducted, using an {{unsteady}} three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulation, to define the effect of impeller-diffuser interaction {{on the performance of}} a centrifugal compressor stage. The principal finding from the study was that the most influential aspect of this unsteady interaction was the effect on impeller tip leakage flow. In particular, the unsteadiness due to the upstream potential effect of the diffuser vanes led to larger viscous losses associated with the impeller tip leakage flow. The consequent changes at the impeller exit with increasing interaction were identified as reduced slip, reduced blockage, and increased loss. The first two were beneficial to pressure rise while the third one was detrimental. The magnitudes of the effects were examined using different impeller-diffuser spacings and it was shown that there was an optimal radial gap size for maximum impeller pressure rise. The physical mechanism was also determined: when the diffuser was placed <b>closer</b> to the <b>impeller</b> than the optimum, increased loss overcame the benefits of reduced slip and blockage. The findings provide a rigorous explanation for experimental observations made on centrifugal compressors. The success of a simple flow model in capturing the pressure rise trend indicated that although the changes in loss, blockage and slip were due largely to unsteadiness, the consequent impacts on performance were mainly onedimensional. The influence of flow unsteadiness on diffuser performance was found to be less important than the upstream effect, by a factor of seven in terms of stage pressure rise in the present geometry. It is thus concluded that the beneficial effects of impeller-diffuser interaction on overall stage performance come mainly from the reduced blockage and reduced slip associated with the unsteady tip leakage flow in the impeller. by Yu Kwong Patrick Shum.

40|$|In this work, {{the mass}} {{transfer}} of {{oxygen in the}} atmospheric leaching process of zinc sulphide was investigated. Four new experimental apparatus items suitable for this purpose were designed and developed. The experiments conducted with the water model were focused on volumetric mass transfer, gas and liquid flow patterns, gas dispersion and bubble size. The effects of liquid properties and temperature on bubble size were examined with the bubble swarm system. Mass transfer coefficients, kL, between oxygen and different liquids were measured with mass transfer equipment. Modified high-temperature and pressure autoclave {{was used to determine}} the oxygen consumption rates in leaching conditions. The experimental set-ups and program carried out are discussed and the errors and problems associated with the techniques reviewed. The results revealed, amongst other occurrences, that the non-coalescence of bubbles occurs and the bubble size is controlled by the formation and breakage <b>close</b> to the <b>impeller.</b> According to the experiments, it seems to be possible to control the foaming and the surface aeration by adjusting the liquid volume and gas flow rate in the process. Too much liquid in the process increases the foaming, while too little increases the surface aeration. Furthermore, increasing the gas flow rate decreases foaming. Gas hold-up increased with mixing speed, while increasing the gas flow rate decreased the power consumption, as expected. Experimentally determined volumetric mass transfer values, kLa, varied between (2. 17 - 12. 00) × 10 − 3   1 /s and mass transfer values, kL, between (13. 81 - 19. 24) × 10 − 5  m/s with oxygen and pure water. On the other hand, kL values between oxygen and process solutions varied between (1. 5 - 11. 32) × 10 − 5  m/s. Increasing electrolyte content decreased the mass transfer values notably, sulphuric acid and zinc sulphate additions having a stronger effect than sodium chloride. Both the determined mass transfer parameters were also strongly dependent on the mixing intensity. The oxygen consumption rate in the process solution varied between 0. 018 - 0. 075  mmol/(m 2 s). Increasing the pressure and mixing intensity increased the oxygen consumption rate significantly, but temperature did not have a similar effect. Decreasing the dissolved zinc content in the solution increased the oxygen consumption rate significantly, whereas increasing the amount of concentrate only slightly increased the consumption rate. The experimental results of this work provide additional data for the improvement of existing leaching models, as well as the development of new ones. reviewe...|$|R
