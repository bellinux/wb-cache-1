40|$|International audienceWe {{experimentally}} {{determined the}} maximum tension in synthetic fluid inclusions from the differ ence between the temperatures of homogenization (Th) and spontaneous vapor nucleation (Tn). At temper atures of 100 - 200 Â°C, liquid water may exist at negative pressures {{of up to}} 100 - 150 MPa. Owing {{to an increase in}} surface tension, the effect is even more significant in salt solutions and occurs at higher tempera tures. A decrease in the linear dimension of fluid phase by an order of magnitude and, correspondingly, a three orders of magnitude decrease in volume (which is proportional to R 3) increase the maximum tension by ~ 25 MPa. Tension in the liquid phase of water-salt systems may be higher than ~ 200 MPa without cavitation. Metastability of water and salt solutions in small sized vacuoles generates stresses in the fluid-mineral system resulting in high solubilities of solid phases. An increase in volume due to <b>coalescence</b> <b>of</b> small <b>inclusions</b> or vanishing <b>of</b> metastability results in an abrupt decrease in supersaturation...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} study investigates the cracking processes in a brittle material associated with <b>inclusions</b> <b>of</b> varying shape, orientation and materials. Specifically, this study summarizes {{a series of}} uniaxial compression tests on gypsum specimens with varying inclusion materials, shapes and pair configurations using high speed imagery to determine cracking behavior. The inclusions in the study consisted of differing materials, of contrasting Young's Modulus (higher and lower than the matrix), shapes (hexagon, diamond, ellipse), and relative pair orientations (bridging angle). In addition, single ellipse inclusions were tested to investigate the cracking behavior associated with an ellipse inclusion in a brittle material. Similar to previous research regarding the <b>coalescence</b> <b>of</b> cracks propagating from inclusion pairs, the inclusion material {{did not affect the}} coalescence patterns. The coalescence behavior trended from indirect or no coalescence, to direct shear coalescence, to combined direct tensile-shear coalescence as the inclusion bridging angle was increased, similar to past studies on circular and square inclusion pairs, as well as flaw pairs. An analogy was proposed relating the debonded inclusion interfaces to corresponding flaw pairs to compare coalescence behavior. Although the general coalescence trends regarding the effect of bridging angle on inclusion pairs were comparable to those of flaw pairs, the coalescence based on a debonded interface representation {{did not appear to be}} similar to that of corresponding flaw pairs. Along with previous work conducted by the MIT rock mechanics group, this research provides detailed experimental observations regarding both the cracking and <b>coalescence</b> behaviors <b>of</b> <b>inclusions</b> in a brittle material. by Stephen Philip Morgan.

40|$|The <b>coalescence</b> process <b>of</b> {{droplets}} and, more recently, {{of liquid}} marbles, {{has become one}} of the most essential manipulation schemes in digital microfluidics. This process is indispensable for realising microfluidic functions such as mixing and reactions at microscale. This paper reviews previous studies on droplet coalescence, paying particular attention to the <b>coalescence</b> <b>of</b> liquid marbles. Four coalescence systems have been reviewed, namely, the <b>coalescence</b> <b>of</b> two droplets freely suspended in a fluid; the <b>coalescence</b> <b>of</b> two sessile droplets on a solid substrate; the <b>coalescence</b> <b>of</b> a falling droplet and a sessile droplet on a solid substrate; and liquid marble coalescence. The review is presented according to the dynamic behaviors, physical mechanisms and experimental parameters <b>of</b> the <b>coalescence</b> process. It also provides a systematic overview <b>of</b> how the <b>coalescence</b> process <b>of</b> droplets and liquid marbles could be induced and manipulated using external energy. In addition, the practical applications <b>of</b> liquid marble <b>coalescence</b> as a novel microreactor are highlighted. Finally, future perspectives on the investigation <b>of</b> the <b>coalescence</b> process <b>of</b> liquid marbles are proposed. This review aims to facilitate better understanding <b>of</b> the <b>coalescence</b> <b>of</b> droplets and of liquid marbles as well as to shed new insight on future studies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring {{cold forming}} {{processes}} materials {{are subjected to}} non-monotonic complex multiaxial loadings. To obtain complex shapes at low temperature {{requires the use of}} particularly ductile materials. The damage behaviour of two ductile steels is studied here at different scales. At the macro-scale, tensile tests are performed in different directions with respect to the grain flow orientation in order to highlight the anisotropy of the behaviour. Tensile tests after pre-compression stages are performed to study the influence of pre-compression on damage evolution. For these two steel grades it is observed that pre-compression tends to increase ductility. At the micro-scale, in situ tensile tests are performed in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) as well as in an X-ray tomography device (synchrotron-ESRF). These techniques are particularly well suited to observe and understand the stages of nucleation, growth and <b>coalescence</b> <b>of</b> voids in the vicinity <b>of</b> <b>inclusions.</b> The influence <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> shape and orientation on damage anisotropy and pre-compression behaviour is discussed...|$|R

30|$|Narsimhan [8] {{proposed}} {{a model for}} drop coalescence in a turbulent flow field as a two-step process consisting {{in the formation of}} a doublet due to drop collisions followed by <b>coalescence</b> <b>of</b> the individual droplets occurring after the drainage of the intervening film by the action of van der Waals, electrostatic, and random turbulent forces. The turbulent flow field was assumed to be locally isotropic. A first-passage-time analysis was employed for the random process in the intervening continuous phase film between the two drops. The first two moments <b>of</b> <b>coalescence</b> time distribution <b>of</b> the doublet were evaluated. The average drop <b>coalescence</b> time <b>of</b> the doublet was dependent on the barrier due to the net repulsive force. The predicted average drop coalescence time was found to decrease whenever the ratio of the average turbulent force to repulsive force barrier became larger. The calculated coalescence time distribution was broader with a higher standard deviation at lower energy dissipation rates, higher surface potentials, smaller drop sizes, and smaller size ratios of unequal drop pairs. Zhang et al. [9] conducted a study on <b>coalescence</b> <b>of</b> unequal-sized drops. In this study the <b>coalescence</b> <b>of</b> a drop with a flat liquid surface pinches off a satellite droplet from its top, whereas the <b>coalescence</b> <b>of</b> two equally sized drops does not appear to produce, in this case, a satellite drop. The authors found that the critical ratio grows monotonically with the Ohnesorge number and, as reported, the experimental <b>coalescence</b> <b>of</b> two unequal-sized droplets.|$|R

An {{increase in the}} rate <b>of</b> <b>coalescence</b> <b>of</b> drops is expected to decrease the dispersed phase fraction at which inversion occurs. In the present work, we increased the rate <b>of</b> <b>coalescence</b> <b>of</b> drops by adding electrolyte to pure liquid-liquid dispersions. The experiments carried out for three representative liquid-liquid systems show that contrary to the expectation the addition of an electrolyte increases the dispersed phase fraction at which inversion occurs for both, oil-in-water and water-in-oil dispersions. The step-down experiments confirm that {{the addition of the}} electrolyte increases the rate <b>of</b> <b>coalescence</b> <b>of</b> drops in lean dispersions under the same conditions, thereby confirming an anomalous effect of the presence of an electrolyte on the stability of dispersions.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{focuses on}} the <b>coalescence</b> <b>of</b> two water drops, one of which {{contains}} surfactant. The coalescence {{was carried out in}} surrounding silicone oils of various viscosities. It has been found that, in all the studied cases, the outward motion of the liquid neck follows the power scaling law with exponent â¼ 0. 5 with the pre-factor dependent upon the surfactant concentration and viscosity of outer phase. Interfacial Marangoni flows arising at coalescence were visualised and quantified. Considerable convective bulk motion was observed by <b>coalescence</b> <b>of</b> surfactant-laden and surfactant-free drops with patterns depending on viscosity of outer phase. No noticeable convection was observed during the <b>coalescence</b> <b>of</b> two surfactant-free drops or similar surfactant-laden drops. It was confirmed that the rate of growth of the liquid bridge was reduced when the surfactant was present in the drops due to the lower interfacial tension in the bridge. Dependence of the reduction on surfactant concentration and viscosity of surrounding liquid is discussed. For the <b>coalescence</b> <b>of</b> a surfactant-free drop and a surfactant-laden drop, the curvature of the meniscus was different {{on either side of the}} growing bridge...|$|R
