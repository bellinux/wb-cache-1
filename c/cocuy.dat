25|$|The Ocetá Páramo {{is part of}} the El <b>Cocuy</b> sub-basin, an {{inverted}} basin in the Eastern Ranges. During the Hauterivian, the El <b>Cocuy</b> and Tablazo sub-basins formed a continuous basin due to the flooding of the Santander-Floresta paleohigh. The main uplift in the Eastern Ranges occurred between the late Oligocene and Pleistocene, with increased tectonic uplift in the Plio-Pleistocene. The Neogene compression {{led to the formation of}} alluvial fans in the intermontane valleys of the Eastern Cordillera. Pollen analysis has shown the transition from lowland tropical forests to colder mountainous vegetation over the last 5 million years. The youngest uplifted eastern chain of the Colombian Andes formed the provenance area for the Magdalena River. In the vicinity of the area of Ocetá, to the southwest in Iza and Paipa for the Eastern Cordillera unique volcanic and magmatic activity is noted from 4.7 to 2.1 Ma.|$|E
5000|$|The first populations inhabiting {{the present-day}} Metropolitan Area of Bogotá, were {{hunter-gatherer}} {{people in the}} late Pleistocene. The oldest dated evidence thus far has been discovered in El Abra (12,500 BP), north of Zipaquirá. Slightly later dated excavations in a rock shelter southwest {{of the city in}} Soacha provided ages of ~11,000 BP; Tequendama. Since around 0 AD, the Muisca domesticated guinea pigs, part of their meat diet. The people inhabiting the Bogotá savanna in the late 15th century were the Muisca, speaking Muysccubun, a member of the Chibcha language family. Muisca means [...] "people" [...] or [...] "person", making [...] "Muisca people", how they are called, a tautology. At the arrival of the conquerors, the population was estimated to be half a million indigenous people on the Bogotá savanna of up to two million in the Muisca Confederation. They occupied the highland and mild climate flanks between the Sumapaz Mountains to the southwest and <b>Cocuy's</b> snowy peak to the northeast, covering an approximate area of , comprising Bogotá's high plain, the current Boyacá department portion and a small Santander region.|$|R
25|$|Along {{the route}} from Monguí {{to the highest}} point of the Ocetá Páramo, a series of sights are present. From most of the route, to the (south)west, {{a view of the}} Duitama-Sogamoso Valley, {{especially}} the settlements of Tibasosa, Nobsa and Duitama, is visible. From the Mirador de Cóndores and the Cerro de Águilas on clear days it is possible to see the snowy peaks of the Sierra Nevada del <b>Cocuy</b> and even the Llanos Orientales.|$|E
25|$|Scholars {{agree that}} the group {{identified}} as Muisca migrated to the Altiplano Cundiboyacense in the Formative stage (between 5500 and 1000 BCE), as shown by evidence found at Aguazuque and Soacha. Like the other formative-stage cultures of America, the Muiscas were transitioning between being hunter-gatherers and becoming sedentary farmers. Around 1500 BCE, groups of agrarians with ceramic traditions came to the region from the lowlands. They had permanent housing and stationary camps, and worked the salty water to extract salt. In Zipacón {{there is evidence of}} agriculture and ceramics. The oldest settlement of the highlands dates to 1270 BCE. Between 500 BCE and 800 BCE, a second wave of migrants came to the highlands. Their presence is identified by multicolor ceramics, housing, and farms. These groups were still in residence upon the arrival of the Spanish conquerors. They left abundant traces of their occupation that have been studied since the 16th century, and allow scientists to reconstruct their way of life. It is possible that the Muisca integrated with more ancient inhabitants, but the Muisca were the ones who molded the cultural profile and the social and political organization. Their language, a dialect of Chibcha, was very similar to those peoples of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (Kogui, Ijka, Wiwa, and Kankuamo) and the Sierra Nevada del <b>Cocuy</b> (U'wa).|$|E
