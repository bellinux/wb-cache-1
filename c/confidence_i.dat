I can see past the {{decision}} of this House either for or against me, but whether it be against me or for me, I know, {{and it is no}} vain boast to say so, for even my enemies will admit that I am no boaster, that there does not exist in Canada a man who has given more of his time, more of his heart, more of his wealth, or more of his intellect and power, as it may be, for the good of this Dominion of Canada.|$|E
25|$|I scored 114 in {{the first}} innings and 97 in the second. I will not claim that the first innings was a {{particularly}} good one, as it took me almost seven hours. But neither would I pretend {{that it was not}} immensely satisfying. I took ball after ball, blow after blow on that improvised body-shield but was able to stand firm...The second innings was the best I ever played. From the firm foundations of real <b>confidence</b> <b>I</b> was able to get after the bowling and repay Hall, particularly, for some of the anguish he had caused me. I had one glorious hour against him...I hooked him twice in a row and reduced him to the kind of despair which, but a fortnight earlier, had been exclusively mine.|$|E
25|$|When General Bell first {{sent me to}} Victor I {{offered him}} certain {{evidence}} {{in regard to the}} perpetrators of the Vindicator explosion, which he has failed to follow up, but which would have led to the arrest and conviction of the men who are responsible for the placing of that infernal machine. At about the 20th of January, 1904, by order of the adjutant of Teller County military district, and under special direction of Major T. E. McClelland and General F. M. Reardon, who was the Governor's confidential adviser regarding the conditions in that district, a series of street fights were commenced between men of Victor and soldiers of the National Guard on duty there. Each fight was planned by General Reardon or Major McClelland and carried out under their actual direction. Major McClelland's instructions were literally to knock them down, knock their teeth down their throats, bend in their faces, kick in their ribs and do everything except kill them. These fights continued more or less frequently up to the 22d of March. About the middle of February General Reardon called me into Major McClelland's office and asked me if I had a man in whom I could place absolute <b>confidence.</b> <b>I</b> called in Sergeant J. A. Chase, Troop C, First Cavalry, N. G. C., and, in the presence of Sergeant Chase, he stated to me that, owing to the refusal of the Mine Owners' Association to furnish the necessary money to meet the payroll of the troops, it had become necessary to take some steps to force them to put up the cash, and he desired me to take Sergeant Chase and hold up or shoot the men coming off shift at the Vindicator mine at 2 o'clock in the morning. I told General Reardon that I {{was under the impression that}} most of these men caught the electric car that stopped at the shaft house so that such a plan would be impracticable. He then said to me that the same end could be reached if I would take the sergeant and fire fifty or sixty shots into the Vindicator shaft house at some time during the night. Owing to circumstances making it impossible for Sergeant Chase to accompany me, I took Sergeant Gordon Walter of the same troop and organization, and that same night did at about 12:30 o'clock fire repeatedly into the Vindicator and Lillie shaft house. Something like sixty shots were fired from our revolvers at this time. Afterwards we mounted our horses and rode into Victor and into the Military Club, reporting in person to General Reardon and Major McClelland. The next day General Reardon directed me to take Sergeant Walter and look over the ground in the rear of the Findlay mine with a view of repeating the performance there, but before the plan could be carried out General Reardon countermanded the order, stating his reason to be that the mine owners had promised to put up the necessary money the next day, which, as a matter of fact, they did. General Reardon, in giving me directions regarding the shooting up of the Vindicator shaft house, stated that Governor Peabody, General Bell, he himself, and I were the only ones who knew anything about the plan.|$|E

[...] He also defended his decision to players such as Gerrard and Alonso on the bench: [...] "It was my idea to start with the players that had the most fitness and have played the most minutes. Then I wanted to bring the other players on towards the end. It worked and it showed that we have a great squad – better than last season." [...] Crouch, scorer of the winning goal, was also confident the result would boost the Liverpool squad: [...] "There is a bit of rivalry between the sides and it is great to get an early one over them.

Kennedy later penned a memo, lamenting that the assassination was [...] "particularly abhorrent" [...] and blaming himself for approving Cable 243, which had authorised Lodge to explore coup options in the wake of Nhu's attacks on the Buddhist pagodas. Forrestal said that [...] "It shook him personally ... bothered him as a moral and religious matter.

2500|$|His fast bowling {{gave him}} the {{nickname}} [...] "Typhoon Tyson", and despite his short career he achieved status as the fastest England bowler in living memory. Don Bradman called him [...] "the fastest bowler I have ever seen" [...] and Richie Benaud agreed, writing [...] "For a short time, Frank Tyson blasted all-comers". Tom Graveney wrote 'I cannot believe any bowler was faster than Tyson at that time'. When fielding in the slips he had 'to stand 40 yards off the bat, and still. the ball was often going over our heads from edged shots'. His Northants colleague Jock Livingston said 'When really firing, Tyson was the quickest of all {{over a period of}} three or four overs'. Livingston had seen Harold Larwood bowl Bodyline and batted against the Australian fast bowlers Miller and Lindwall in the Sheffield Shield. At the Aeronautical College in Wellington, New Zealand in 1955 metal plates were attached to a cricket ball and a sonic device was used to measure their speed, with Tyson's bowling measured at [...] 89mph (142km/h), but he was wearing three sweaters on a cold, damp morning and used no run up, Brian Statham bowled at 87mph (139km/h). He certainly bowled faster than 89mph in matches, and Tyson claimed that he could bowl at 119mph (190km/h), but this cannot be proven. The best that can be said was that he was noticeably faster than his contemporaries Ray Lindwall, Keith Miller, Fred Trueman, Brian Statham, Peter Heine and Neil Adcock. His great fast bowling rival Fred Trueman ‘was forever being told that when it came to bowling I was very fast, but on his day Frank Tyson was faster than me' and it was Tyson who kept Trueman out of the England team in 1954–55. When they played together in a Gentlemen v Players match at Scarborough in 1957 the captain Godfrey Evans insisted Trueman bowl into the headwind so as to give the faster Tyson the advantage of the tailwind. Dickie Bird, the famous England umpire, wrote [...] "he was certainly the quickest bowler I ever seen through the air, and on one occasion the quickest bowler I never saw through the air". When playing for [...] at Scarborough in 1958 [...] "I opened the innings against him and hit his first three deliveries through the off side for four. With supreme <b>confidence</b> <b>I</b> went on to the front foot for the fourth ball. Tyson dropped one short. It reared up and hit me on the chin. I went down as if I'd just been {{on the receiving end of}} a right hook...I still carry the scar to show my folly that day. There was blood all over and I saw stars. I could hear bells ringing in my head...". Dickie came back to score his then highest first class score of 62 and Tyson took 4/30. When they met in Australia in 1998–99 Tyson joked 'You're looking well Dickie. See you still have the scars though'.|$|E
