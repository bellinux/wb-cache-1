40|$|In the {{framework}} of the Generalized Beam Theory (GBT) a new cross-section analysis is proposed, specifically suited for nonlinear elastic thin-walled beams (TWB). The approach is developed according to the nonlinear Galerkin method (NGM), which calls for the evaluation of nonlinear (passive) trial functions, to be used in conjunction with linear (active) trial functions, in describing the displacement field. The set of (quadratic) trial functions is determined here by requiring that the classic Vlasov's kinematic hypotheses of the linear theory (i. e. (a) transverse inextensibility and (b) unshearability) are satisfied also in the nonlinear sense. The linear field is described by the so-called <b>conventional</b> <b>displacements,</b> by neglecting non-conventional displacements, which violate Vlasov's hypotheses. The nonlinear trial functions thus generated are innovative deformation fields, which describe extensional and shear displacements in a different way from that of the non-conventional fields of the linear theory. In particular, they consist of non-constant tangential and out-of-plane displacements of the cross-section profile, able to ensure inextensibility and unshearability of all the plate elements, by balancing the second-order strains induced by the <b>conventional</b> <b>displacements.</b> Since nonlinear trial functions do not increase the number of the unknowns, the GBT spirit, as a reduction method, is preserved. A very promising example is discussed, which shows that equilibrium paths can be determined by using few linear trial functions in conjunction with the corresponding nonlinear trial functions, supplying good results when compared with burdensome finite-element solutions...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{accepted}} that severe numerical difficulties arise {{when using the}} <b>conventional</b> finite element <b>displacement</b> method to analyse incompressible, or nearly incompressible, solids. These effects are caused by the kinematic constraints imposed on the nodal velocities by the constant volume condition. In elastic-plastic analysis, these effects are due to a conflict between the plastic flow rule and the finite element discretization. Although several methods have been proposed {{to cope with this}} problem, none has been based on the appropriate choice of displacement interpolation to minimise the constraints. In this paper, a new displacement interpolation, which is able to reduce the imposed constraints, is adopted. Comparisons of the results with those from a <b>conventional</b> linear <b>displacement</b> interpolation are made for predictions of cylindrical and spherical cavity expansion limit pressures in elastic-plastic solids.

40|$|We review {{existing}} manifestations {{and prospects}} for ferroelectricity in electronically and optically active carbon-based materials. The focus {{point is the}} proposal for the electronic ferroelectricity in conjugated polymers from the family of substituted polyacetylenes. The attractive feature of synthetic organic ferroelectrics is a very high polarizability coming from redistribution of the electronic density, rather than from <b>conventional</b> <b>displacements</b> of ions. Next fortunate peculiarity is the symmetry determined predictable design of perspective materials. The macroscopic electric polarization follows ultimately from combination of two types of a microscopic symmetry breaking which are ubiquitous to qusi- 1 D electronic systems. The state supports anomalous quasi-particles - microscopic solitons, carrying non-integer electric charges, which here {{play the role of}} nano-scale nucleus of ferroelectric domain walls. Their spectroscopic features in optics can interfere with low-frequency ferroelectric repolarization providing new accesses and applications. In addition to already existing electronic ferroelectricity in organic crystals and donor-acceptor chains, we point to a class of conducting polymers and may be also to nano-ribbons of the graphene where such a state can be found.

40|$|Three {{experimental}} alloy steels, {{designed to}} provide superior corrosion-abrasion resistance over conventional commercially available steels in deep level hard rock mining conditions, were investigated in order to elucidate their stress corrosion performance in solutions containing the principle aggressive ionic salt species encountered in typical mine waters. The steels are: A low carbon, chromium containing martensitic steel, designated Alloy 122; a metastable chromium manganese austenitic steel, designated Alloy 1210 and a low alloy martensitic steel, designated Alloy 927. The accent of the investigation was on determining the threshold stress intensity at which environmentally assisted sub-critical flaw propagation initiated. To achieve this aim, a dual experimental approach was adopted. A monotonic rising load technique was employed to obtain experimental results in the short term. These results were subsequently compared to the results obtained in longer, <b>conventional</b> constant <b>displacement</b> stress corrosion experiments. Environmentally assisted cracking was noted to occur in all the material-environment combinations investigated for both the rising load and conventional test programmes. For Alloy 122, crack growth initiation occurred at stress intensities which varied between 30 % and 60 %, depending upon the environment, of the material fracture toughness, Kie· The threshold stress intensities of Alloy 121 O were decreased by two thirds from the fracture toughness level and by approximately 50 % in the instance of Alloy 927. The fracture surface morphologies, obtained during rising load testing, consisted predominantly of intergranular fracture along the prior austenite grain boundaries. The results of the long term <b>conventional</b> constant <b>displacement</b> test programme indicate that the threshold stress intensities for all the materials, occur between approximately 20 % and 35 % of their fracture toughness stress intensities. The fracture surface morphologies consisted entirely of intergranular separation (all materials) at the threshold stress intensities. Comparison of {{the two sets of}} experimental results indicates that the rising load test method over-estimates the threshold stress intensity.

This complex geometry can lead to spatially confined trajectories that are difficult to analyze and interpret using conventional two-dimensional MSD analysis. Here we present two methods to analyze spatially confined trajectories: spline-curve dynamics analysis, which extends conventional MSD analysis to measure diffusive motion in confined trajectories; and spline-curve spatial analysis, which measures spatial structures smaller than the limits of optical resolution. We show, using simulated random walks and experimental trajectories of quantum dot probes, that differences in measured two-dimensional diffusion coefficients do not always reflect differences in underlying diffusive dynamics, but can instead be due to differences in confinement geometries of cellular structures...|$|R
