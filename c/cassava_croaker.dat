40|$|Lanhouin, a {{fermented}} fish {{product is}} processed by spontaneous and largely uncontrolled fermentation. Disadvantages {{of this type}} of fermentation are that very little control can be exercised over the fermentation process and the product is often of variable quality with inherent risks of quality defects. Samples of lanhouin processed from <b>cassava</b> <b>croaker</b> /cassava fish (Speudotolithus sp.) or Spanish mackerel / king fish (Scomberomorus tritor), widely used as condiment in Benin, Togo, and Ghana, were purchased from processors and retailers in the processing sites and markets respectively, for product characterization. The samples were obtained from 20 retailers and 20 processors randomly selected in urban and rural processing sites and markets. The samples were transported under aseptic conditions to laboratory for analyses. The chemical composition of samples was determined using Pearsonâ€™s and AOAC methods. The microbiological status was investigated according to the Nordic Committee on Food Analysis standard methods. The results showed that the pH values of th...|$|E
40|$|Aspects of {{the feeding}} habits and diet of juveniles of the <b>cassava</b> <b>croaker</b> Pseudotolithus senegalensis (Valenciennes, 1833) (Sciaenidae) and bigeye grunt Brachydeuterus auritus (Valenciennes, 1831) (Haemulidae) in the inshore waters of Cape Coast, Ghana are {{reported}} in the study. Both species had a similar diet consisting of larvae of fish, shrimps and cuttlefish. The croaker ingested prey up to 77 % of its total length while the bigeye grunt consumed prey up to 70 % of its total length. Analysis of the stomach contents, based on the frequency of occurrence, and numerical and gravimetric compositions of these food items indicated that shrimps were the main food of P. senegalensis while B. auritus fed mainly on fish. While shrimps constituted the predominant food of the croakers all-year-round, the bigeye grunts appeared to shift their preference for fish to shrimps from June to September. The {{results of the study}} are compared with those on croakers {{from other parts of the}} Gulf of Guinea. The study, however, appears to be the first to give a detailed account of the food preference and feeding ecology of the bigeye grunt...|$|E
