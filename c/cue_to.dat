5|$|Scientists also {{view the}} ability to grow very long hair {{as a result of}} sexual selection, since long and healthy hair is a sign of {{fertility}} and youth. An evolutionary biology explanation for this attraction is that hair length and quality can act as a <b>cue</b> <b>to</b> youth and health, signifying a woman's reproductive potential. As hair grows slowly, long hair may reveal 2–3 years of a person's health status, nutrition, age and reproductive fitness. Malnutrition and deficiencies in minerals and vitamins due to starvation causes loss of hair or changes in hair color (e.g. dark hair turning reddish).|$|E
5|$|With half-time fast approaching, Barcelona's {{confidence}} {{began to}} show: first, Messi attempted to flick a {{pass over the}} top of the United defence to Thierry Henry, which Rio Ferdinand intercepted; Iniesta then tried an ambitious back-heel that Van der Sar collected; and finally Messi sped through three Manchester United defenders towards the by-line, only for his cut-back cross to be pounced upon by Van der Sar and then cleared by Vidić. On the stroke of half-time, Iniesta himself then attempted to flick the ball through to Henry, but it was just too high for the French striker, and referee Massimo Busacca took that <b>cue</b> <b>to</b> blow the whistle for the interval.|$|E
5|$|In {{most current}} cultures, {{it is more}} typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so. An American study shows {{significant}} correlation between hair length and age, which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women. A significant correlation was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health. Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, {{these results indicate that}} hair length and quality can act as a <b>cue</b> <b>to</b> a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. The correlation between the woman's hair length and marital status, or number of children, was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length and age.|$|E

40|$|Advancing our {{knowledge}} about <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> deception {{is crucial to}} successful deception detection. A lengthy list of <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> deception has been identified via a myriad of deception studies. Nonetheless, we identified two major limitations of existing <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> deception: the lack of cues in computer-mediated communication and in non-Western group communication. In this research, we aim to make some contributions to addressing this line of inquiry. We conducted an empirical study on <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> deception using a large real-world online Chinese community. Through hypotheses testing, we observed a number of interesting findings. For example, we found that deceivers tended to communicate less and showed low complexity and high diversity in their messages. These findings provide significant implications to deception research and the broad online communication community...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Two studies {{examined}} women’s {{perception of}} the relationship between sexual exploitability and sexual attrac-tiveness and women’s use of <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> sexual exploitability to signal sexual accessibility. Study 1 (N = 77) found that women accurately assessed other women displaying <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> sexual ex-ploitability both as sexually exploitable and sexually attractive to men. Study 2 (N = 74) tested the predictions that women who were dispositionally inclined toward short-term mating, who were not in a committed relationship, and who perceived themselves to be low in mate value would be more likely <b>to</b> display <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> sexual exploitability as a mate attraction tactic. Results supported the first prediction. These results suggest that asubsetofwomen, thosedispositionally inclinedtowardashort-term mating strategy, employ the risky strategy of signaling sexual accessibility using <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> exploitability to advance their mating goals...|$|R
5|$|Overall {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to past entries in the series. The player, as Alex, explores the various environments and locales, searching for clues to advance the plot, such as photographs, drawings and other items which are placed inside Alex's journal, which the player may read at any time. To assist the player, Alex will turn his head towards items and clues to inform the player that the object may be picked up; other recurring items include weapons and ammunition, which give off a glow as a visual <b>cue</b> <b>to</b> the player, and health drinks. Puzzle elements also {{play a part in}} the game, and Alex's journal may be used to refer to photographs and other items that can help the player decipher such puzzles as keypad entries. For {{the first time in the}} series, the player may select responses when engaging in dialogue with other characters encountered in the game, which in turn may affect how the player sees the plot unfold.|$|E
5|$|Beginning about 6:45, {{many members}} of the public began calling NBC network and {{affiliate}} switchboards. Some demanded the game be shown to its conclusion; others wanted to know if Heidi would start on time. These calls jammed the switchboards, and even blew repeated fuses in them, preventing the executives from getting through to each other to resolve the situation. NBC protocol required an operations order from Connal, to countermand the midweek written orders, but Cline received no call from the increasingly desperate Connal, who was frustrated by the switchboard issues. Without such an order, and not knowing of Goodman's approval, Cline made the decision that Heidi would start on time. The television audience saw Smith return Turner's kickoff out of the end zone to the Oakland 22-yard line with 1:01 remaining. Burbank BOC played the closing football theme and gave the word <b>cue,</b> <b>to</b> the outraged shock of Ellis and Connal, and the connection was irretrievably broken. Although the western United States continued to view the game, the eastern half of the nation instead saw a little girl on a Swiss mountain and was unaware that Oakland was in the course of scoring two touchdowns to win the game.|$|E
5|$|While {{most of the}} {{employees}} are congregated in the pool area, Robert gives some of the male employees a tour of his massive home, spending {{most of the time}} mournfully describing how it was intended to be the location for wild, uninhibited parties. He offers those present on the tour a free bottle of wine from his wine cellar and the staff proceed to get drunk. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) had intended to make a token appearance at Robert's party and quickly return home to his wife and kids; however, Robert, sensing his reluctance to be there, insists that Jim stay {{for the duration of the}} tour in order to punish him for laughing at an inopportune moment earlier that day as Robert had complained about having to sell his house. Eventually, Robert realizes that he is hosting one of the parties he had always imagined, at which point he jumps into the pool completely naked, followed by Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who had both been battling all night to impress him. Jim takes this as his <b>cue</b> <b>to</b> leave, sneaking away and driving home at top speed. At the end of the night, Gabe and Ryan, both drunk and unwilling to concede defeat in their brown-nosing battle, remain at the party with Robert even as the CEO passes out.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} two {{experimental studies}} investigating {{the effects of}} presenting cues that provide information about the interactors - called <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> identity - in computer mediated communications (CMCs). Study 1 shows that even though <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> identity affected interpersonal evaluations, in making them more positive, {{the presence of these}} cues were associated with less certainty and less medium satisfaction for users with experience in online communication. Study 2 shows that when performing an online communication task, participants felt more certain, were more satisfied with the medium, and thought they had performed better in the absence of <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> identity. Thus, this study supports the widespread assumption that rich interactions (i. e., interactions that allow the transmission of <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> identity such as face-to-face) are superior in that they make the interaction more personal, but that these outcomes are not mirrored by the evaluation of the interaction. It is suggested that the presence of <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> identity positively affects interpersonal perceptions, {{but at the same time}} decreases perceptions of solidarity or entitativity. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|While no new locales were {{introduced}} in Episode One, large alterations {{were made to the}} appearance of both City 17 where the game takes place and the Citadel from the end of Half-Life 2 to reflect the changing shape of the world and remind the player that their actions have major effects on the story line. The Citadel has degenerated from the cold, alien, and imposing fortress of the previous game into an extremely unstable state. This provides a visual <b>cue</b> <b>to</b> the player of the catastrophic damage they inflicted, and it allows for the introduction of new gameplay elements that accentuate the dangers which come with the Citadel's imminent collapse. In addition, it serves a thematic purpose by highlighting the weakening of the Combine's dominance in City 17. Likewise, City 17 has been altered to reflect the aftermath of the resistance's open rebellion, with vast swathes of destroyed buildings, and the introduction of foes previously kept outside its confines in Half-Life 2 to emphasize the scale of the uprising.|$|E
5|$|English Open: O'Sullivan {{competed in}} the first of the four Home Nations events, the English Open. In the First Round, O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Zhang Anda 4–1. He won despite injuring his ankle prior to the match, and was forced to play in trainers in violation of the player's dress code. World Snooker later gave O'Sullivan permission to wear trainers {{for the rest of the}} Open. In the Second Round, O'Sullivan beat Mark Davis 4–1, compiling back-to-back century breaks of 136 and 134 in the last two frames of the match. In the Third Round, he continued his good form, winning 4–1 against Zhang Yong. O'Sullivan compiled three centuries during the Third Round match. The match was interrupted at the end of the final frame by a female spectator running around the table. Despite the distraction, O'Sullivan continued playing and potted the pink ball for a break of 129 before he offered his <b>cue</b> <b>to</b> the spectator so she could take his last shot (where she missed twice) before being led away by security. In the Last Sixteen match, O'Sullivan trailed John Higgins 0–1, 1–2, and 2–3 before triumphing in the decider and winning 4–3. In the Quarterfinals O'Sullivan beat Jack Lisowski 5–2. In the Semifinals O'Sullivan scored a 6–4 victory over Anthony McGill to reach the Final. In the Final, O'Sullivan defeated Kyren Wilson 9–2 for his 29th ranking title. During the Final match he compiled four centuries and had a pot success of 98%, missing only a total of 6 balls during the 11 frames played. Altogether, O'Sullivan compiled 12 centuries during the tournament, more than any other competitor. This was O'Sullivan's first victory in a ranking event in more than 20 months.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduced}} haptic <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> {{the serial}} reaction time (SRT) sequence learning task alongside the standard visual <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> assess the relative contributions of haptic and visual stimuli {{to the formation}} of motor and perceptual memories. We used motorized keys to deliver brief pulse-like displacements to the resting fingers, expecting that the proximity and similarity of these <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> the subsequent response motor actions (finger activated key-presses) would strengthen the motor memory trace in particular. We adopted the experimental protocol developed by Willingham in 1999 to explore whether haptic cues contribute differently than visual <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> the balance of motor and perceptual learning. We found that sequence learning occurs with haptic stimuli as with visual stimuli and we found that irrespective of the stimuli (visual or haptic) the serial reaction time task leads to a greater amount of motor learning than perceptual learning...|$|R

25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{prospective}} memory: event-based and time-based prospective memory. Event-based prospective memory involves remembering to perform certain actions when specific circumstances occur.

Time-based prospective memory involves remembering to perform an action at a particular point in time.

25|$|Sometimes, songs vocalized in post-breeding season {{act as a}} <b>cue</b> <b>to</b> conspecific eavesdroppers. In black-throated blue warblers, males {{that have}} bred and {{reproduced}} successfully sing to their offspring to influence their vocal development, while males that have failed to reproduce usually abandon the nests and stay silent. The post-breeding song therefore inadvertently informs the unsuccessful males of particular habitats that have a higher likelihood of reproductive success. The social communication by vocalization provides a shortcut to locating high quality habitats and saves the trouble of directly assessing various vegetation structures.|$|E

40|$|English-learning 7. 5 -month-olds {{are heavily}} biased to {{perceive}} stressed syllables as word onsets. By 11 months, however, infants begin segmenting non-initially stressed words from speech. Using the same artificial language methodology as Johnson and Jusczyk (2001), we explored {{the possibility that}} the emergence of this ability is linked to a decreased reliance on prosodic <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> word boundaries accompanied by an increased reliance on syllable distribution cues. In a baseline study, where only statistical <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> word boundaries were present, infants exhibited a familiarity preference for statistical words. When conflicting stress <b>cues</b> were added <b>to</b> the speech stream, infants exhibited a familiarity preference for stress as opposed to statistical words. This was interpreted as evidence that 11 -month-olds weight stress <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> word boundaries more heavily than statistical cues. Experiment 2 further investigated these results with a language containing convergent <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> word boundaries. The results of Experiment 2 were not conclusive. A third experiment using new stimuli and a different experimental design supported the conclusion that 11 -month-olds rely more heavily on prosodic than statistical <b>cues</b> <b>to</b> word boundaries. We conclude that the emergence of the ability to segment non-initially stressed words from speech {{is not likely to be}} tied to an increased reliance on syllable distribution <b>cues</b> relative <b>to</b> stress <b>cues,</b> but instead may emerge due to an increased reliance on and integration of a broad array of segmentation cues...|$|R

The respondents did not need much of a <b>cue</b> <b>to</b> respond socially to the computers. The experiment proves that social rules can apply to media and computers can be social initiators. Participants denied being intentionally polite to the computer, but the results suggest differently.|$|E

The commission could not find that the weather or the wind was a contributing cause, although the darkness and fog could have hindered the crew from gaining a visual <b>cue</b> <b>to</b> their location.|$|E

500|$|The {{questions}} about the veracity of Chatwin's writing are compounded by the revelation of his sexual orientation and the true cause of his death. Once it became known that Chatwin had been bisexual and had died of an AIDS-related illness, some critics viewed him as a liar and dismissed his work. Nicholas Shakespeare said, [...] "His denial [...] bred a sense that if he lied about his life, he must have lied about his work. Some readers have taken this as a <b>cue</b> <b>to</b> pass judgement on his books – or else not to bother with them." [...] In 2010 The Guardian's review of Under the Sun: The Letters of Bruce Chatwin opened with the question, [...] "Does anyone read Bruce Chatwin these days?" [...] However, Rory Stewart has stated, [...] "His personality, his learning, his myths, and even his prose are less hypnotizing [...] And yet he remains a great writer, of deep and enduring importance.” In 2008 The Times [...] named Chatwin #46 on their list of [...] "50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945".|$|E
500|$|Both Lutosławski's {{harmonic}} and aleatory {{processes are}} illustrated by example 1, {{an excerpt from}} Hésitant, the first movement of the Symphony No. 2. At number 7, the conductor gives a <b>cue</b> <b>to</b> the flutes, celesta and percussionist, who then play their parts in their own time, without any attempt to synchronise with the other instrumentalists. The harmony of this section {{is based on a}} 12-note chord built from major seconds and perfect fourths. After all the instrumentalists have finished their parts, a two-second general pause is indicated. The conductor then gives a cue at number 8 (and indicates the tempo of the following section) for two oboes and the cor anglais. They each play their part, again with no attempt to synchronise with the other players. The harmony of this part is based on the hexachord F–G–A–C–D–D, arranged {{in such a way that}} the harmony of the section never includes any sixths or thirds. When the conductor gives another cue at number 9, the players each continue until they reach the repeat sign, and then stop: they are unlikely to end the section at the same time. This [...] "refrain" [...] (from numbers 8 to 9) recurs throughout the movement, slightly altered each time, but always played by double-reed instruments which do not play elsewhere in the movement: Lutosławski thus also carefully controls the orchestral palette.|$|E

To achieve this aim, he decided against recording digitally, instead recording the tracks on two-inch analog tape, intending each musical <b>cue</b> <b>to</b> {{sound as if}} it was emanating from a vinyl record. He explained, [...] "The idea was to put together a band that would record the score together the same way that they would make an album. It isn't over-produced or shiny and digital in any way. It's brash, noisy, and full of bravado and swagger. I knew that if we could harness some of this sonic magic in the score, then the toughness and confidence of the music would play against Bateman, Sudeikis, and Charlie Day to really emphasize and elevate the humor in the situations that transpire." [...] Lennertz continued, [...] "We tracked through tape before Pro Tools to get that fat sound, and made every choice based on feel rather than perfection. We even used the same Wurlitzer that Money Mark played on Beck's classic ‘Where It's At’. At the end of the day, Seth [...] and I wanted to produce a score that is as irreverent and full of attitude as the movie itself. I think we did it...and most of all, everyone had a blast in the process." ...|$|E
