50|$|The FACCH {{is always}} {{paired with a}} traffic channel. The FACCH is a blank-and-burst channel that {{operates}} by stealing bursts from its associated traffic channel. Bursts that carry FACCH data are distinguished from traffic bursts by stealing bits {{at each end of}} the midamble. The FACCH is used for in-call signaling, including <b>call</b> <b>disconnect,</b> handover and the later stages of call setup. It has a payload data rate of 9.2 kbit/s when paired with a full-rate channel (FACCH/F) and 4.6 kbit/s when paired with a half-rate channel (FACCH/H). The FACCH uses the same interleaving and multiframe structure as its host TCH.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{structure}} of magnetospheric transients observed at the dusk-side low-latitude magnetopause with the Interball Tail Probe. Ion and magnetic field measurements are used to investigate one particular transient in more detail. This transient has distinct non-symmetric structure with the plasma characteristics and the flow properties of the leading part of the transient being quite different {{from those in the}} trailing part of the transient. The region separating these two parts corresponds to the change of the sign in the B(n) component. These observations support an earlier conclusion that some plasma irregularities within the Low Latitude Boundary Layer (LLBL), formed as a result of sporadic reconnection, disconnect from the magnetopause, propagate and dissipate in the magnetosphere, and form what we <b>call</b> <b>Disconnected</b> Magnetosheath Transfer Events (DMTEs) ...|$|R

40|$|Recall the {{definition}} of connectedness (2. 45 in [1]). Definition 1. Let (X, d) be a metric space. A subset E ⊆ X is <b>called</b> <b>disconnected</b> (or separated) if there exists nonempty A, B ⊂ E such that E = A ∪ B, and A ∩ B = A ∩ B = ∅. A subset is called connected {{if it is not}} disconnected. Example 2. In R with the Euclidean metric, consider the set E = [0, 1] ∪ (2, 3). Since (2, 3) = [2, 3], the strong condition [0, 1] ∩ (2, 3) = ∅ holds, which implies that the two subsets A = [0, 1] and B = (2, 3) form a separation of E. Hence E is not connected. Example 3. Again in R, consider the set E = [0, 1) ∪ (1, 2]. This set is also disconnected...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The Learning Curve (TLC) in neurofeedback concept emerged after Peter Van Deusen {{compiled}} {{the results}} of articles on the expected electrical activity of the brain. This concept was subsequently tested on patients at four clinics in Atlanta between 1994 and 2001. The aim {{of this paper was}} to report the historical aspects of TLC. Articles published on the electronic databases MEDLINE/PubMed and Web of Science were reviewed. During patient evaluation, TLC investigates categories <b>called</b> <b>disconnected,</b> hot temporal lobes, reversal of alpha and beta waves, blocking, locking, and filtering or processing. This enables neuroscientists to use their training designs and, by means of behavioral psychology, to work on neuroregulation, as self-regulation for patients. TLC shows the relationships between electrical, mental and behavioral activity in patients. It also identifies details of patterns that can assist physicians in their choice of treatment...|$|R

40|$|In Graph Theory, a {{connected}} component of an undirected graph is a subgraph in which any two vertices {{are connected to}} each other by paths. For a graph G, if the subgraph G itself is a {{connected component}} then the graph G is called connected, else the graph G is <b>called</b> <b>disconnected</b> and each connected component subgraphs is called its components. A dominating set D a of graph (,) G V E is a non-split dominating set, if the induced subgraph V D is connected. The non-split dominating number () ns G of G is the minimum cardinality of a non-split dominating set. The 2 -tuple domination problem {{is to find a}} minimum size vertex subset such that every vertex in the graph is dominated by at least 2 vertices in the set. In this paper we discussed an algorithm to find a 2 -tuple dominating set of an induced subgraph of a non-split dominating set of an interval graph...|$|R

40|$|Flavor singlet {{combinations}} of quark operators O Γ S = ūΓu + ¯ dΓd + ¯sΓs contribute to many important physical observables {{in the low}} energy region of QCD. Experimentally one finds the values {{of some of these}} observables to be {{in sharp contrast to the}} naive (perturbative) theoretical expectations. This indicates that non perturbative vacuum properties might play a major role in the comprehension of these phenomena. An example of such a vacuum contribution is the axial anomaly, which appears in the divergence of the flavor singlet axial current and which is connected to the topological properties of QCD. From a field theoretical point of view flavor singlet matrix elements differ from non singlet amplitudes in the occurrence of so <b>called</b> <b>disconnected</b> insertions. These are correlations of hadron propagators with quark-antiquark loops or correlations between quarkantiquark loops, which are mediated by vacuum fluctuations. According to their respective flavor composition, the disconnected insertions cancel largely in non singlet processes, but add in flavor singlet amplitudes. The lattice approach provides an ideal tool to study flavor singlet phenomena. Bein...|$|R

40|$|Two {{disjoint}} subsets A and B of a vertex set V of {{a finite}} graph G are <b>called</b> <b>disconnected</b> {{if there is}} no edge between A and B. If V is the set of words of length n over an alphabet { 1, [...] .,q} and if two words are adjacent whenever their Hamming distance is not equal to afixedδ∈{ 1, [...] .,n}, then a pair of disconnected sets becomes an equidistant code pair. For disconnected sets A and B we will give a bound for |A | ·|B| in terms of the eigenvalues of a matrix associated with G. In case the complement of G is given by a relation of an association scheme the bound takes an easy form, which applied to the Hamming scheme leads to a bound for equidistant code pairs. The bound turns out to be sharp for some values of q, n and δ,andforq→∞for any fixed n and δ. In addition, our bound reproves some old results of Ahlswede and others, such as the maximal value of |A|·|B|for equidistant code pairs A ans B in the binary Hamming Scheme. ...|$|R
