50|$|Thread {{sealants}} such as joint <b>compound</b> (<b>pipe</b> dope or {{thread seal}} tape such as PTFE tape) are unnecessary on compression fitting threads, {{as it is}} not the thread that seals the joint but rather the compression of the ferrule between the nut and pipe. However, a small amount of plumber's grease or light oil applied to the threads will provide lubrication to help ensure a smooth, consistent tightening of the compression nut.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Using {{diamond saw}} wire could cut the seabed oil <b>compound</b> <b>pipes.</b> There are {{different}} advancing velocities {{according to the}} material of pipes; it makes the cutting and advancing velocities under the condition of harmony {{at the time of}} cutting the <b>compound</b> <b>pipes</b> underwater. First of all, the experiment system of diamond saw wire was set up by test cistern, equipment of diamond wire saw underwater, hydraulic pressure system, measuring and controlling system, diamond saw wire and single layer seabed oil <b>compound</b> <b>pipes</b> so on. Next, the cutting parameters, which include pipe sizing, working pressure, tensioning force of diamond saw wire, cutting velocity and advancing velocity were initialized and the first experimentation was done. Then, after adjusting the cutting parameters according to the analysis of cutting test, the next cutting experimentation underwater was done. In the end, the wearing capacity of diamond beads was measured and got the optimal advancing velocity which can minish the wearing capacity and prolong the cutting time of diamond beads. So, using these cutting parameters to cut the seabed oil <b>compound</b> <b>pipes</b> validated the feasibility of engineering application...|$|R

40|$|IN {{a recent}} investigation, the {{presence}} of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in unsmoked Venda tobacco was demonstrated (Campbell and Cooper, 1955) and in consequence of these findings and in connection with other studies concerning the amounts of such <b>compounds</b> in <b>pipe</b> tobacco smoke (Gilbert and Lindsey, 1956) a series of experiments was carried out to determine the amounts in unburnt cigarettes, cigarette paper, pipe tobaccos and herbal smoking mixtures. These investigations are reported below. EXPERIMENTAL All the materials examined were dried in vacuo over sulphuric acid and extracted to exhaustion with cyclohexane in a Soxhlet extractor. The solutions so formed were treated with acid and alkali and subjected to chromatographic separation and spectrophotometric determination by the method used for cigarette smoke (Cooper and Lindsey, 1955). The smoking materials so examined were Virginia cigarettes of the type used in previous experiments, paper " cigarettes ", a light pipe tobacoo, a dar...|$|R

Although there are research and case studies documenting the permeation of organic <b>compounds</b> through plastic <b>pipes,</b> there is still a lack of understanding on the performance of PE and PVC pipe materials in hydrocarbon-contaminated soils commonly encountered under field conditions.;A microscopic visualization technique was developed to investigate the permeation of organic solvents through PVC pipes by observing the formation and propagation of organic fronts in pipe materials with a light microscope. The threshold concentrations of toluene where a moving front was formed were 25...|$|R

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The design of polyethylene (PE) pipelines for applications in the gas, water and chemical process industries {{has been based on}} data mainly obtained from stress rupture testing pipes only. In practice, installations are composed of both extruded pipe and injection moulded fittings which are joined by a fusion welding technique and are very often subjected to internal pressures of a fluctuating nature. Several makes of PE pipe systems were therefore obtained and work was undertaken to fully characterise mechanical performance in terms of internal pressure loadings. Butt-welded test specimens comprising pipe lengths and fittings were subjected to both static and fluctuating conditions at 80 °C, at pressures resulting in brittle fractures (below the knee on stress rupture curves) and at frequencies not exceeding 7. 5 cpm (0. 125 Hz). Resulting fracture surfaces were examined to identify sources of crack initiation and mechanisms of failure. Mechanical behaviour of the PE pipe samples was found to be markedly influenced by the grade of plastics <b>compound,</b> the <b>pipe</b> system dimensions, mould designs and methods of processing. Fatigue loading was the most aggressive test method and significant reductions in lifetimes were observed in fittings or joints between pipes and fittings with only modest increases in the frequency of pressurisation. It was also demonstrated that improved stress rupture behaviour did not necessarily lead to better fatigue performance. For the square-wave loading profiles used, an idea of the relevant failure mechanisms in any given system was obtained by comparing experimental Nf values with those predicted from cumulative damage principles based on Nf=τSR/τmax. In all types of system, failure was initiated at a defect residual from processing or jointing. Over 95...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of disinfection by-products (DBPs) of chlorine dioxide (ClO₂) in drinking water, namely: chlorite, chlorate, and THMs {{as well as}} the concentration of ClO₂ were investigated. Two hundred ninety four drinking water samples were collected during the time period from March to August 2014. The water samples were collected from seven desalination plants (DPs), four resevoirs and eight mosques distributed in South and North Qatar. The ClO₂ level was ranged from 0. 38 to less than 0. 02 mg/L, with mean value of 0. 17, 0. 12, and 0. 04 mg/L in the desalination plants (DPs), the reservoirs (R), and the mosques (M), respectively. The chlorite level was varied from 12. 78 - 436. 36 ppb with median values varied from 12. 78 to 230. 76, from 77. 43 to 325. 25, and from 84. 73 to 436. 36 ppb in the DPs, the reservoirs, and the mosques, respectively. While chlorate was varied from 10. 66 ppb to 282. 71 ppb with mean values varied from 35. 58 to 282. 72 ppb, from 11. 02 to 200. 69, and from 10. 66 to 150. 38 ppb in the DPs, R, and M respectively. However, the average value of THMs was 4. 90 ppb, while maximum value reached 76. 97. Lower disinfectant residual was observed in few samples, however this could be attributed to the normal decomposition reaction of ClO₂ with organic and inorganic <b>compounds,</b> including biofilms, <b>pipe</b> materials, corrosion products, formation of slime or may due to the fact the water in distribution system experience water aging problem. Significant differences were observed in the concentration level of chlorite, chlorate and THMs between DPs, reservoirs and the mosques. However, the concentrations of all DBPs fell wihtin the range of the regulatory limit set by GSO 149 / 2009, WHO and KAHRAMAA (KM). It is recommended to slightly increase the average ClO₂ dosage at the DPs. Such slight increase would provide safer margin at the customer point of use in case of any microbial activities. Consideration must be given to the overall demand and should account for seasonal variations, temperature, and application points. As well as a monitoring approach is recommended for the drinking water safety assessment. Re-conducting the study to include other DPs of ClO₂ is recommended...|$|R
