2500|$|On 29 April 2001, Mara {{publicly}} {{accused the}} police chief, Colonel Isikia Savua and former Prime Minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, of instigating the coup. In {{what was to}} be his last public interview, Mara claimed that George Speight – who was then in custody and has since been convicted of treason – was only a front, Mara told Close-Up on Fiji Television that he confronted Savua and Rabuka two days after the coup about their possible involvement. [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> their faces," [...] said Mara, emphatically rejecting their denials.|$|E
2500|$|Film {{historian}} Jeffrey Vance {{said that}} Garbo communicated her characters' innermost feelings through her movement, gestures, and most importantly, her eyes. With the slightest movement of them, he argues, she subtly conveyed complex attitudes and feelings toward other characters {{and the truth}} of the situation. [...] "She doesn't act," [...] said Camille co-star Rex O’Malley; [...] "she lives her roles." [...] Director Clarence Brown, who made seven of Garbo's pictures, told an interviewer [...] "Garbo has something behind the eyes that you couldn't see until you photographed it in close-up. You could see thought. If she had to look at one person with jealousy, and another with love, she didn't have to change her expression. You <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> her eyes as she looked from one to the other. And nobody else has {{been able to do that}} on screen." [...] Director George Sidney adds [...] "You could call it underplaying but in underplaying she overplayed everyone else." ...|$|E
60|$|Further remonstrance {{would be}} useless; I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> her face; I {{could hear it}} in her voice. I turned round to open the drawing-room door.|$|E
60|$|They were in Charmian's studio, where Cornelia's {{sketch of}} her had been {{ever since she}} left working on it; and Charmian ran and got it, and set it where they <b>could</b> both <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> {{the light of the}} new event.|$|R
60|$|But {{it would}} be wonderfully {{interesting}} to watch the growth of such a fungus. You <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> grow. <b>In</b> one night you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> its whole life, from almost {{nothing at all to}} that enormous ball in the picture. Nature could hardly show us a more astonishing sight than that.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> June 2009 <b>it</b> was {{revealed}} that the society was facing a rescue plan which <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> broken up <b>in</b> a similar way to the Dunfermline Building Society.|$|R
6000|$|I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> <b>in</b> her face, at last clear itself; she put out {{her hand}} {{to me as a}} pledge. [...] "I'll go--I'll go. I'll go this morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a murmur}} of applause at the conductor's compact reasoning, {{and it gave}} him pleasure--you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his face. But the Major was not disturbed. He said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor dears" [...] (I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the toss of her head); [...] "they {{will think}} they know best; {{it is just as}} well not to argue with them." ...|$|E
60|$|Not {{a muscle}} {{moved in the}} {{beautiful}} face before him. He <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> profile, for Marguerite seemed to be watching the stage intently, but Chauvelin was a keen observer; he noticed the sudden rigidity of the eyes, the hardening of the mouth, the sharp, almost paralysed tension of the beautiful, graceful figure.|$|R
6000|$|... "As if {{a painted}} little {{marmoset}} were worth a man's heart! But Allen {{has always been}} infatuated about her, and there's a good deal at stake, though, if he <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the right fight, he is well quit of such a bubble of a creature. I wouldn't be saddled with it for all Belforest." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{hedgehog}} {{was engaged}} {{in a fight with}} another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across {{to the other side of}} the garden, where Alice <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> trying <b>in</b> a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Devine had risen, {{was coming}} {{slowly across the}} room. Fear laid hold of the Colonel. She was going to address some {{aggravating}} remark to him--he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> her eye--which would irritate him into savage retort.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mad as a hatter!" [...] shrieked old Mr. McIntyre. [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his eye. He spent {{enough on}} this beast to start me in business. Whoever {{heard of such}} a thing? Tell the driver {{to take it to the}} police-station." ...|$|E
60|$|Then Cauchon {{pronounced}} the words which dissolved the excommunication and restored {{her to her}} beloved Church, with all the dear privileges of worship. Ah, she heard that! You <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the deep gratitude that rose in her face and transfigured it with joy.|$|E
60|$|Her {{affections}} {{were not}} acute, nor was her mind tenacious. After a time, Fanny found it not impossible to direct her thoughts to other subjects, and revive {{some interest in}} the usual occupations; but whenever Lady Bertram was fixed on the event, she <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> only <b>in</b> one light, as comprehending {{the loss of a}} daughter, and a disgrace never to be wiped off.|$|R
6000|$|At all events, Byron {{never set}} to work to consecrate his own sin into a {{religion}} and proclaim the worship of uncleanness as the last and highest ethical development of [...] "pure" [...] humanity. No--Byron may be brutal; but he never cants. If at moments he finds himself in hell, he never turns round {{to the world and}} melodiously informs them that it is heaven, if they <b>could</b> but <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> its true light.|$|R
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "Ah, I don't know that. It's a deep drawer"--he begins {{taking the}} linen out, and laying {{it on the}} floor--"and the dress-suit {{may be at the}} bottom. No! Nothing here. You're right, Roberts. Well, now for the top drawer and the last. If we'd taken that out first, we needn't have taken out the second; we <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place. You ought to have thought of that, Roberts." ...|$|R
6000|$|Once {{upon a time}} {{an artist}} who had painted a small and very {{beautiful}} picture placed it so that he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the mirror. He said, [...] "This doubles the distance and softens it, and it is twice as lovely as it was before." ...|$|E
60|$|Curiously-formed and large-leaved {{trees of}} the tropics, with their pendent parasites, as well as rank grasses, {{sprouting}} from below and hanging from above, partially concealed this cavern from Nigel when he first turned towards it, but a few steps further on he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> all its rugged grandeur.|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew--I {{knew she}} would be {{everything}} when once the first strangeness was over; but, poor girl, her heart is in Africa, {{and it has been}} all exile here; I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> every letter, though she tried {{to make the best of}} it. If there had but been a child here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But what {{a mistake}} to go as a {{character}} you know nothing about. To enjoy a masquerade ball you ought to throw away your own self and be the character you represent. Now Courtenay has been Harlequin since half-way through dinner; I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> dancing <b>in</b> his eyes. At about six o'clock to-morrow morning he will fall asleep and wake up {{a member of the}} British House of Parliament on his honeymoon, but to-night he is unrestrainedly Harlequin." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the foot}} of this wind mill Mr. George and Rollo <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the water running <b>in</b> under <b>it,</b> through a sluice way which led from a low canal, {{and on the other}} side they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> pouring out <b>in</b> a great torrent, into a higher one.|$|R
6000|$|As Pupkin {{walked down}} the street, {{the whole thing was}} so vivid in his mind that he could picture it to the remotest detail. He <b>could</b> even <b>see</b> <b>it</b> all <b>in</b> type, in big {{headings}} in the newspapers of the following day: ...|$|R
6000|$|Fitzpiers {{told her}} that there was yet one thing more to be done. [...] "In {{creeping}} over the fence on to the lawn," [...] he said, [...] "I made the rail bloody, and it shows rather much on the white paint--I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the dark. At all hazards it should be washed off. Could you do that also, Felice?" ...|$|E
60|$|Tarzan smiled. Even {{here was}} the racial {{distinction}} between white man and black man--Ho-don and Waz-don. Not even {{the fact that they}} appeared to be equals in the matter of intelligence made any difference--one was white and one was black, and {{it was easy to see}} that the white considered himself superior to the other--one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his quiet smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "But Miss Bertram {{does not}} care three straws for him; that is your opinion of your {{intimate}} friend. I do not subscribe to it. I am sure Miss Bertram is very much attached to Mr. Rushworth. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> her eyes, when he was mentioned. I think too well of Miss Bertram to suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart." ...|$|E
60|$|Scarcely {{had they}} closed their eyes than the terrifying {{cry of a}} panther rang out from the jungle behind them. Closer and closer it came until {{they could hear the}} great beast {{directly}} beneath them. For an hour or more they heard it sniffing and clawing at the trees which supported their platform, but at last it roamed away across the beach, where Clayton <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> clearly <b>in</b> the brilliant moonlight--a great, handsome beast, the largest he had ever seen.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she turned}} her head sharply as she heard the click of a bolt. This was strange, because Lucille had locked the gate. She <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the gloom of the arch, but it had {{certainly}} opened. Then as she waited with somewhat excited curiosity a dark figure appeared {{on the edge of the}} light, and she put down her book as Richter came forward. He made very little noise and stopped near the table.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, {{when your}} son {{proposed}} {{to take hold}} here, I didn't have much faith in his ideas, that's the truth. But I had faith in him, and I saw that he meant business from the start. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> was born <b>in</b> him. Any one could." ...|$|R
6000|$|The thrush was brought, and the {{two birds}} poured out their marvels of song together. The king wavered, then his {{inclination}} began to settle and strengthen--one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his countenance. Hope budded {{in the hearts of}} the old ministers, their pulses began to beat quicker, the scepter began to rise slowly, when: There was a hideous interruption! It was a sound like this--just at the door: ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{looked at}} the man clad in mean {{garments}} and foul from his labour in the brickfield, marvelling at his insolence. There was no doubt but that he believed what he said; I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his proud eye and bearing. He thought that his tribe was of more import {{in the world than}} our great and ancient nation, and that he, an unknown youth, equalled or surpassed Pharaoh himself. Then, being enraged by these insults, I answered: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, SEEMED," [...] {{returned}} Susy darkly, [...] "but that's all you know! It {{was in his}} BLOOD. You know {{it always}} is,--you {{read it in the}} books,--you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his eye. There were times, my dear, when he was thwarted,--when the slightest attention from another person to me revealed it! I have kept it to myself,--but think, dearest, of the effects of jealousy on that passionate nature! Sometimes I tremble to look back upon it." ...|$|E
500|$|French filmmaker Robert Bresson {{admired the}} film. [...] "It {{filled me with}} wonder because of its cinematographic writing... if I <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> twice <b>in</b> a row and again the next day, I would have done." [...] Elsewhere Bresson said he also loved the film's ski chase.|$|R
60|$|Instantly {{the figure}} reappeared, {{and making a}} wide circuit, began to head me off. I was tired, at any rate; but had I been as fresh as when I rose, I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> was <b>in</b> vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversary. From trunk to trunk the {{creature}} flitted like a deer, running manlike on two legs, but unlike any man that I had ever seen, stooping almost double as it ran. Yet a man it was, I {{could no longer be}} in doubt about that.|$|R
60|$|And {{they were}} quite frank about their enterprise--bananas and tobacco in the {{plantation}} district reclaimed from the insurrectos. You <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> all there <b>in</b> the pictures--tobacco plants and the insurrectos--everything. They made no rash promises, just admitted straight out that the enterprise might realise 400 per cent. or might conceivably make less. There was no hint of more.|$|R
