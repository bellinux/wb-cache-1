40|$|Consider a {{specific}} type of fission where psychological continuity takes a branching form, and one of the offshoots <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> later than the other offshoot. Let us say that the earlier offshoot <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> in the left branch at t, and the later offshoot <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> in the right branch at t+ 1. With regard to the question how many persons are involved in this case, three answers are worth considering: (i) The original subject persists up to t; a distinct person <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> immediately after t and continues to exist in the left branch; and the third person <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> in the right branch at t+ 1. (ii) The original subject persists up to the moment immediately before t+ 1; a distinct person <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> at t+ 1 and continues to exist in the left branch; and the third person <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> in the right branch at t+ 1. (iii) The original subject continues to exist in the left branch; a distinct person <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> in the right branch at t+ 1. For those who hold that personal identity consists in psychological continuity of some sort, the aforementioned three options exhaust the sensible ways of understanding how one persists in delayed fission. However, I argue that complications arise for each answer. Hence, delayed fission poses a challenge for the psychological approach to personal identity. close...|$|R

Under the Constitution of Australia, defence responsibility was now vested in the new federal government. The co-ordination of Australia-wide defensive efforts in the face of Imperial German interest in the Pacific Ocean was one of driving forces behind federalism, and the Department of Defence immediately <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> as a result, while the Commonwealth Military Forces (early forerunner of the Australian Army) and Commonwealth Naval Force were also soon established.|$|E

The historian Gerald of Wales lectured to such scholars in 1188 and the first known foreign scholar, Emo of Friesland, arrived in 1190. The head of the university had the title of chancellor from at least 1201, and the masters were recognised as a universitas or corporation in 1231.

5|$|When a {{temporary}} Air Board {{was set up}} to examine the feasibility of an Australian Air Force (AAF), Goble was assigned as a Navy representative, with Lieutenant Colonel Richard Williams, an Australian Flying Corps veteran of World War I, acting as an Army spokesman.

The AAF <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> on 31 March 1921—the 'Royal' prefix being granted five months later—and Goble resigned his commission in the RAF the same day to transfer to the new service as a wing commander.|$|E

5|$|A {{letter of}} Hadrian written from Egypt to his {{brother-in-law}} Servianus is quoted at length (and {{was accepted as}} genuine by many authorities well into the 20th century). Servianus is saluted as consul, and Hadrian mentions his (adopted) son Lucius Aelius Caesar: but Hadrian was in Egypt in 130, Servianus' consulship fell in 134, and Hadrian adopted Aelius in 136. The letter {{is said to have}} been published by Hadrian's freedman Phlegon, with the letter's existence not mentioned anywhere except in the History, in another suspect passage. A passage in the letter dealing with the frivolousness of Egyptian religious beliefs refers to the Patriarch, head of the Jewish community in the Empire. This office only <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> after Hadrian put down the Jewish revolt of 132, and the passage is probably meant in mockery of the powerful late 4th-century Patriarch, Gamaliel.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, Gould {{was elected}} to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the member for Patrick's Plains (renamed Singleton in 1894). Initially an {{opponent}} of the coalition associated with Henry Parkes and John Robertson, he later supported Robertson's government in 1885. By 1887 he was supporting his career with his own legal practice in Singleton and Sydney, and when the party system <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>being</b> in New South Wales in that year he identified as a Free Trader. In 1889 he was appointed Minister for Justice under Parkes, serving until 1891; he held the position again under George Reid from 1894 to 1898. During the first period of his ministry he became involved in a dispute with the Chief Justice, Sir Frederick Darley, over requests for improved court accommodation and a contested punishment for contempt of two witnesses. Despite embarrassing his premier, he remained close with Parkes throughout his state career and in later years frequently gave speeches in his memory.|$|E
