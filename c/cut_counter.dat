40|$|Graph cut {{segmentation}} approach {{provides a}} platform for segmenting images in a globally optimised fashion. The graph cut energy function includes a parameter that adjusts its data term and smoothness term relative to each other. However, {{one of the key}} challenges in graph cut segmentation is finding a suitable parameter value that suits a given segmentation. A suitable parameter value is desirable in order to avoid image oversegmentation or under-segmentation. To address the problem of trial and error in manual parameter selection, we propose an intuitive and adaptive parameter selection for cell segmentation using graph cut. The greyscale image of the cell is logarithmically transformed to shrink the dynamic range of foreground pixels in order to extract the boundaries of cells. The extracted cell boundary dynamically adjusts and contextualises the parameter value of the graph <b>cut,</b> <b>countering</b> its shrink bias. Experiments suggest that the proposed model outperforms previous cell segmentation approaches. </p...|$|R

Most ethnic groups became armed after the first military coup in 1962 and successive military governments used four <b>cuts</b> <b>counter</b> insurgency policy in ethnic areas. This policy involved: the cut off communications among rebel armed {{groups as well as}} local people; the cut off of information among people; the cut off of trade route in designated territories; searches and the destruction of any possible supplies to cut off these areas. [...] On the other hand, the military government forced ethnic groups to sign ceasefire agreements with ethnic rebels groups, while government troops were trying to root out their main bases in 1990s. In meanwhile, ethnic minorities’ political parties which won seats in 1990 elections, and formed the second largest pro-democracy block after NLD, were severely oppressed in cities. By the end of the century, there were twenty armed opposition groups had cease fire agreements with governments. However, the government did not hold political discussions with these groups or winning political parties. Therefore, some ethnic groups continued their armed struggle against the government. The ethnic populations suffered the most the result of long-standing hostilities with the central government. They have been treated as enemies of the state and second class citizens ...|$|R

40|$|The {{idea that}} saving is the force driving private {{investment}} {{and economic growth}} has become ever more entrenched in mainstream economic thought {{as well as in}} the minds of policymakers and the general public. Even though the empirical evidence that increased household saving will directly stimulate private investment and economic growth is scant, the idea remains prominent and underlies policy debates on topics ranging from Social Security to a balanced federal budget to reducing the national debt. The popular theory underlying these <b>cuts</b> is <b>countered</b> by evidence that private sector investment is financed primarily out of business retained earnings, not household saving, which explains why current policies aimed at raising household saving via cuts to social spending programs have been unsuccessful at raising saving rates. Moreover, government spending on social programs does not necessarily reduce economic growth. Higher government spending could be supported, and a greater degree of investment spending stimulated, through a combination of lower taxes on business income and higher taxes on personal incomes of upper-income households...|$|R

In test mode, a circuit under test (CUT) is stimulated with a periodic rectangular pulse generated from a Linear Feed-Back Shift Register (LFSR) and a periodic invariant response is generated. The {{width of the}} pulse is a BIST parameter to allow a trade-off between test time and fault coverage. In order to maximize fault coverage and minimize the hardware overhead, we propose a slope detection technique which analyzes the response of <b>CUT</b> using a <b>counter</b> and a simple digital gate.

On the other hand, nothing tortured her more intolerably than when this recognition was too prominently expressed. To one or two rather officious offers of sympathy, her responses were little short of acrimonious; and, we regret to say, Hepzibah was thrown into a positively unchristian state of mind by the suspicion that one of her customers was drawn to the shop, not by any real need of the article which she pretended to seek, but by a wicked wish to stare at her. The vulgar creature was determined to see for herself what sort of a figure a mildewed piece of aristocracy, after wasting all the bloom and much of the decline of her life apart from the world, would <b>cut</b> behind a <b>counter.</b> In this particular case, however mechanical and innocuous it might be at other times, Hepzibah's contortion of brow served her in good stead.|$|R

5000|$|Belarmino then criticises Albano Martins for {{exploiting}} him {{and there}} is a <b>cut</b> to Martins <b>countering</b> this with accusations of indiscipline on the ex-boxer’s part and a defence of managers in general. This sets the pattern for the debate-like format adopted in this section of the film. We see the antagonistic interdependence between these two types of people involved in a sort of boss-worker relationship. Belarmino intimates that because of his illiteracy and his innumeracy he was often cheated or defrauded of his match purse. He reveals that he now has no job, but makes ends meet through biscatezinhos, his occasional work as a photo-colourist and loans from friends. He says that sometimes he goes hungry, but brushes this off saying: [...] "muitas vezes quero jantar, não tenho, muitas vezes quero almoçar, não tenho, mas não quer dizer que seja fome. É um estado de fraqueza assim razoável." [...] This is an assertion that is both comic and tragic in equal measure.Returning to the subject of his wife, Belarmino reaffirms his love for her but admits to having aventuras with more than a hint of pride. He then talks of his last professional fight in Portugal against a boxer called Sotta, one of his closest rivals. Belarmino won by a knockout, but earned a pittance for his trouble. We return to Albano Martins, who tells us of Belarmino’s indiscipline, of his going out on the town the night before the fight against Sotta and having to undergo a drastic weight-loss regime {{on the day of the}} weigh-in to make the grade. Martins claims Belarmino [...] "podia ser grande", but cites his lack of discipline as the main reason behind his ultimate failure. Belarmino then recounts with evident pride how he managed to be champion of Portugal, despite the hunger and hardships he had to face, and underlines the fact that he was continually cheated due to his illiteracy and innumeracy.|$|R
6000|$|But it is {{needless to}} argue any longer. The matter is {{come to an}} issue. His Majesty {{pursuant}} to the law, hath left the field open between Wood and the kingdom of Ireland. Wood hath liberty to offer his coin, and we have law, reason, liberty and necessity to refuse it. A knavish jockey may ride an old foundered jade about the market, but none are obliged to buy it. I hope the words [...] "voluntary" [...] and [...] "willing to receive it" [...] will be understood, and applied in their true natural meaning, as commonly understood by Protestants. For if a fierce captain comes to my shop to buy six yards of scarlet cloth, followed by a porter laden with a sack of Wood's coin upon his shoulders, if we are agreed about the price, and my scarlet lies ready <b>cut</b> upon the <b>counter,</b> if he then gives me the word of command, to receive my money in Wood's coin, and calls me a [...] "disaffected Jacobite dog" [...] for refusing it (although I am as loyal a subject as himself, and without hire) and thereupon seizes my cloth, leaving me the price in his odious copper, and bids me take my remedy: In this case, I shall hardly be brought to think that I am left to my own will. I shall therefore on such occasions, first order the porter aforesaid to go off with his pack, and then see the money in silver and gold in my possession before I cut or measure my cloth. But if a common soldier drinks his pot first, and then offers payment in Wood's halfpence, the landlady may be under some difficulty; For if she complains to his captain or ensign, they are likewise officers, included in this general order for encouraging these halfpence to pass as current money. If she goes to a justice of peace, he is also an officer, to whom this general order is directed. I do therefore advise her to follow my practice, which I have already begun, and be paid for her goods before she parts with them. However I should have been content, for some reasons, that the military gentlemen had been excepted by name, because I have heard it said, that their discipline is best confined within their own district.|$|R

It would be interesting--as the historians say--to speculate on what he would have done, if he could have foretold what would happen. But he had certainly not foretold the crisis of yesterday evening. He had received a telegram from her at lunch-time, suggesting the fulfilment of a jesting promise, made in Scotland, that she should have tea with him and see his chambers--a small and harmless matter. Only, why had he dismissed his clerk so early? That is the worst of gamblers--they will put a polish on the risks they run. He had not reckoned, perhaps, that she would look so pretty, lying back in his big Oxford chair, with furs thrown open so that her white throat showed, her hair gleaming, a smile coming and going on her lips; her white hand, with polished nails, holding that cigarette; her brown eyes, so unlike Gyp's, fixed on him; her slim foot with high instep thrust forward in transparent stocking. Not reckoned that, when he bent to take her cup, she would put out her hands, draw his head down, press her lips to his, and say: [...] "Now you know!" [...] His head had gone round, still went round, thinking of it! That was all. A little matter--except that, in an hour, he would be meeting the eyes of one he loved much more. And yet--the poison was in his blood; a kiss so <b>cut</b> short--by what--what <b>counter</b> impulse?--leaving him gazing at her without a sound, inhaling that scent of hers--something like a pine wood's scent, only sweeter, while she gathered up her gloves, fastened her furs, {{as if it had been}} he, not she, who had snatched that kiss. But her hand had pressed his arm against her as they went down the stairs. And getting into her cab at the Temple Station, she had looked back at him with a little half-mocking smile of challenge and comradeship and promise. The link would be hard to break--even if he wanted to. And yet nothing would come of it! Heavens, no! He had never thought! Marriage! Impossible! Anything else--even more impossible! When he got back to his chambers, he had found in the box the letter, which her telegram had repeated, readdressed by Gyp from the Red House. And a faint uneasiness at its having gone down there passed through him. He spent a restless evening at the club, playing cards and losing; sat up late in his chambers over a case; had a hard morning's work, and only now that he was nearing Gyp, realized how utterly he had lost the straightforward simplicity of things.|$|R
40|$|Two {{large area}} (l. 29 m. (^ 2)) thin water Cerenkov {{counters}} {{have been developed}} and their properties investigated when amino G acid (a wavelength shifter) {{is added to the}} water. With a concentration of I 6 mg. /litre of the acid an increased response of'~ 5 is achieved, as well as the uniformity improving by a factor of 2, compared with that of a pure water counter. The efficiency of the acid, however, has been found to deteriorate at a rate of 3. 5 %/month. The velocity response of the counters has been studied and it is found that, for counters of the present geometry, the addition of the acid is essential to maintain the inherent property of Cerenkov counters: that of a sharp velocity <b>cut</b> off. The <b>counters,</b> together with plastic scintillators, neon flash tubes and suitable amounts of absorber have been combined to form a large aperture (~ 0, 1 m. (^ 2) sterad.) telescope capable of mass discrimination over a range of several Gev/c(^ 2). The properties of, and mass resolution attainable with such a system have been investigated by selecting sub-relativistic sea level cosmic ray protons to traverse the telescope. The mass resolution achieved for protons was a full width at half height of 350 Mev/c(^ 2), and the intensities of observed protons were found to be in good agreement with measurements of other workers in the same energy region. The telescope has been operated in a search for sub-relativistic massive particles, having integral or fractional charge ('quarks'), in the sea level cosmic radiation (typically M> 1. 3 Gev/c(^ 2) for z = 1; a lower value applying for z 4 Gev/c(^ 2)), weakly interacting and to comprise ~ 10 (^- 3) of the primary radiation). Deuterons have been detected at various stages of the work and their, intensity in the sea level cosmic radiation has been evaluated as (DIAGRAM FORMULA) The measured intensities {{have been shown to be}} an order of magnitude too large to be consistent with the bulk of production coming through reactions such as NN→dTT, but they are apparently consistent with what would be expected from 'pick-up' reactions. The 'heavy mass telescope" has been modified to investigate the possibility of the direct production of muons, from the interactions of neutral primaries, at a rate much greater than that expected from neutrinos having their 'noimal' cross section. The results of a series of experiments that were performed were suggestive of a very high pion and proton background, and within the uncertainties in the sea level neutron spectrum the observed rates of events were not inconsistent with all of them having been neutron induced. It is concluded that there is no evidence for an excess of muons induced by neutral primaries as has repeatedly been reported by Cowan et al., (l 964 - 1969) ...|$|R
