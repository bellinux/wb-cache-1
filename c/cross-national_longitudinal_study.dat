40|$|PURPOSE: There {{have been}} few {{longitudinal}} studies of deliberate self-harm (DSH) in adolescents. This <b>cross-national</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>study</b> outlines risk and protective factors for DSH incidence and persistence. METHODS: Seventh and ninth grade students (average ages 13 and 15  years) were recruited as state-representative cohorts, surveyed, and then followed up 12 months later (N = 3, 876), using the same methods in Washington State and Victoria, Australia. The retention rate was 99 % in both states at follow-up. A range of risk and protective factors for DSH were examined using multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The prevalence of DSH {{in the past year}} was 1. 53 % in Grade 7 and. 91 % in Grade 9 for males and 4. 12 % and 1. 34 % for Grade 7 and Grade 9 females, respectively, with similar rates across states. In multivariate analyses, incident DSH was lower in Washington State (odds ratio [OR] =. 67; 95 % confidence interval [CI] =. 45 - 1. 00) relative to Victoria 12 months later. Risk factors for incident DSH included being female (OR = 1. 93; CI = 1. 35 - 2. 76), high depressive symptoms (OR = 3. 52; CI = 2. 37 - 5. 21), antisocial behavior (OR = 2. 42; CI = 1. 46 - 4. 00), and lifetime (OR = 1. 85; CI = 1. 11 - 3. 08) and past month (OR = 2. 70; CI = 1. 57 - 4. 64) alcohol use relative to never using alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: Much self-harm in adolescents resolves over the course of 12  months. Young people who self-harm have high rates of other health risk behaviors associated with family and peer risks that may all be targets for preventive intervention...|$|E
40|$|Purpose : To {{examine the}} effect of school {{suspensions}} and arrests (i. e., being taken into police custody) on subsequent adolescent antisocial behavior such as violence and crime, after controlling for established risk and protective factors in Victoria, Australia and Washington State, United States (U. S.). Methods : This article reports on analyses of two points of data collected 1 year apart within a <b>cross-national</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>study</b> of the development of antisocial behavior, substance use, and related behaviors in approximately 4000 students aged 12 to 16 years in Victoria, Australia and Washington State, U. S. Students completed {{a modified version of the}} Communities That Care self-report survey of behavior, as well as risk and protective factors across five domains (individual, family, peer, school, and community). Multivariate logistic regression analyses investigate {{the effect of}} school suspensions and arrests on subsequent antisocial behavior, holding constant individual, family, peer, school, and community level influences such as being female, student belief in the moral order, emotional control, and attachment to mother. Results : At the first assessment, school suspensions and arrests were more commonly reported in Washington, and school suspensions significantly increased the likelihood of antisocial behavior 12 months later, after holding constant established risk and protective factors (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1. 5, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 1 – 2. 1, p <. 05). Predictors of antisocial behavior spanned risk and protective factors across five individual and ecological areas of risk. Risk factors in this study were pre-existing antisocial behavior (OR 3. 6, CI 2. 7 – 4. 7, p <. 001), association with antisocial peers (OR 1. 8, CI 1. 4 – 2. 4, p <. 001), academic failure (OR 1. 3, CI 1. 1 – 1. 5, p <. 01), and perceived availability of drugs in the community (OR 1. 3, CI 1. 1 – 1. 5, p <. 001). Protective factors included being female (OR 0. 7, CI 0. 5 – 0. 9, p <. 01), student belief in the moral order (OR 0. 8, CI 0. 6 – 1. 0, p <. 05), student emotional control (OR 0. 7, CI 0. 6 – 0. 8, p <. 001), and attachment to mother (OR 0. 8, CI 0. 7 – 1. 0, p <. 05). Conclusions :  School suspensions may increase the likelihood of future antisocial behavior. Further research is required to both replicate this finding and establish the mechanisms by which school suspensions exert their effects. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Existing {{literature}} shows {{only four}} <b>cross-national,</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>studies</b> of infant homicide victimization. More {{than a decade}} has passed since this issue has been taken up in the lit-erature. Consequently, our understanding of infant homicide over time at the cross-national level is limited. In this article, we build on the findings from these four studies using an expanded sample of countries, a longer time series, more valid measures, addi-tional variables, and tests of gender differences. Our expanded analysis confirms many of the findings in the earlier studies but with a few important departures. As in earlier stud-ies, the results confirm that female labor force participation and income inequality are significant predictors of infant homicide victimization rates. But {{we also found that}} com-pared with other countries, those that scored highest on culture of violence measures actu-ally had significantly lower rates of infant homicide victimization...|$|R
40|$|In <b>cross-national</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>studies</b> it {{is often}} {{impossible}} to administer the same measurement instruments at the same occasions to all sample units in all participating countries. This quickly results in large quantities of missing data, due to (a) missing measurement instruments in some countries, (b) missing assessment waves within or across countries, (c) missing data for individual sample units. As compared to cross-sectional studies, the problem of missing values is further aggravated {{by the fact that}} missing values are always associated with different time intervals between repeated observations. In the past, this has often been dealt with by the use of phantom-variables, but this approach is limited to simple designs with few missing value patters. In the present paper we propose a new way to think of, and deal with, missing values in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>studies.</b> Instead of conceiving of a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>study</b> as a study with discrete time points of which some are missing, we propose to conceive of a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>study</b> as a way to measure an underlying process that develops continuously over time, but is only observed at some selected discrete time points. This transforms the problem of missing values into a problem of unequal time intervals. After a quick introduction to the basic idea of continuous time modeling, we demonstrate how this approach provides a straightforward solution to missing measurement instruments in some countries, missing assessment waves within or across countries, and missing data for individual sample units...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. This is a two-wave <b>cross-national</b> and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>study.</b> Data {{were collected in}} both Scotland and Italy, and the procedure differed slightly between the two countries. SCOTTISH PROCEDURE Five General Practitioner (GP) surgeries situated across Scotland posted invitations {{to participate in a}} two-wave <b>longitudinal</b> <b>study</b> to all their patients for whom the study was deemed suitable (those over 18 without terminal illnesses or conditions such as dementia or Alzheimer’s disease). No incentives were provided. Interested patients returned a reply slip included with the invitation. They received a questionnaire, to be completed and returned to the researchers. A member of the research team then visited the GP surgeries around 2 months after the completed questionnaires were received, and extracted health data for each participant from the databases. Approximately two years later, all the participants who had completed the first questionnaire received the second questionnaire via post, to be completed and returned to the researchers. Approximately 2 months after receiving the follow up questionnaires, a member of the research team again visited the GP surgeries in order to extract health data for each participant from the databases. ITALIAN PROCEDURE GPs working in five different surgeries (all based in rural areas in Tuscany, and all members of the same medical cooperative) asked patients visiting the surgeries if they wished to participate in a two-wave <b>longitudinal</b> <b>study.</b> Patients were only invited to participate if they were over 18 and did not possess a terminal illnesses or a condition such as dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. Eligible patients were instructed to complete the first questionnaire either in the surgery waiting room or at home. Patients who agreed to participate handed their completed questionnaires into their GP surgery. Around two months after receiving the completed questionnaires, the GPs extracted health data for each participant from their databases. Approximately two years later, all the participants who had completed the first questionnaire and were visiting the surgery were approached again and invited to complete a second questionnaire, either in the surgery waiting room or at home. This second questionnaire was also completed and handed into the GP surgery. Once again, health data for each participant was extracted from the databases by the GPs around two months after receiving the completed second questionnaires. Project description: The aim of the research is to explore the interplay between group identification and health, overcoming the limitations of previous studies. This involves examining the extent to which group identification influences different aspects of mental and physical health. It is predicted that group identification will have more impact on health than simple physical contact with group members. Moreover, the effects of group identification on health will be compared with the effects exerted by other factors known to predict health, such as socio-economic status and health-related behaviours. The degree to which the effects of group identification on health are independent from the effects of these other factors will also be considered. The prediction that the effects of group identification on health are mediated by perceived social support (ie, the extent to which group members feel they can rely on each other for assistance) will also be tested. To achieve these aims, the proposed research will: (1) test a large sample of participants (N = ~ 16, 000), drawn from two nations (~ 8, 000 from Scotland and ~ 8, 000 from Italy); (2) use a longitudinal design (two waves across a two-year period: 2012 - 2014); (3) use an extended range of physical and mental health indicators...|$|R

40|$|Objective/Background: There is a {{widespread}} belief that moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) declines markedly in adolescence, particularly in girls. This belief has led to substantial research and policy effort aimed at reducing the perceived decline in MVPA during adolescence. The main aim of this review is to critically examine the belief that MVPA declines during adolescence. Methods: Review of evidence from studies with objective measures of physical activity, systematic reviews of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>studies,</b> insights from recent <b>longitudinal</b> <b>studies,</b> and evidence from the International Children's Accelerometry Database (ICAD). Results: Existing systematic review evidence, four recent <b>longitudinal</b> <b>studies</b> from England, and ICAD data all failed to {{support the hypothesis that}} MVPA declines particularly markedly during adolescence, or that an MVPA decline begins at adolescence, or that declines in MVPA during adolescence are greater in girls than in boys. Systematic reviews, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>studies,</b> and ICAD data in fact suggest that MVPA begins to decline, and sedentary behavior begins to increase, from around the age of school entry. Recent <b>longitudinal</b> <b>studies</b> also suggest that increasing sedentary behavior during adolescence displaces light-intensity physical activity. An emerging body of evidence from <b>longitudinal</b> <b>studies</b> that use trajectory analysis is providing important new insights into marked between-individual differences in the trajectories of MVPA across childhood and adolescence. Conclusion: Although gaps in the evidence remain, particularly from low- to middle-income countries, and additional <b>longitudinal</b> <b>studies</b> are required, this review suggests that efforts to promote and/or maintain MVPA should begin well before adolescence...|$|R
