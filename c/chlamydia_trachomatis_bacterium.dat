40|$|Trachoma is chronic kerato conjunctivitis, {{which is}} caused by {{repeated}} infection with <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> <b>bacterium.</b> It is hyper endemic in many rural areas of Ethiopia. The objective {{of this study was}} to measure the effect of water, sanitation and hygiene interventions on active trachoma in selected woredas of North and South Wollo zones of Amhara Region, Ethiopia. A community based quasi-experimental study was conducted from October 2014 to December 2015 among children aged 1 - 8 years at baseline and among one year older same children after intervention. A four-stage random cluster-sampling technique was employed to select study participants. From each selected household, one child was clinically assessed for active trachoma. Structured questionnaire was used to collect socio demographic and behavioral data. MacNemar test was applied to compare the prevalence of active trachoma between baseline and after the intervention period at both intervention and non-intervention study areas. The prevalence of active trachoma was reduced from baseline prevalence of 26 % to 18 % after one-year intervention period in the intervention woredas (P≤ 0. 001). MacNemar test result showed significant reduction of active trachoma prevalence after the intervention period in the intervention woredas compared to the non-intervention woredas (P≤ 0. 001). Water, sanitation and hygiene related activities were significantly improved after the intervention period in the intervention woredas (P< 0. 05). There was a significant reduction of active trachoma prevalence between the baseline and after the intervention period in the intervention woredas, but not in the non-intervention ones. Improved water, sanitation and hygiene interventions contributed to the reduction of active trachoma. However, the magnitude of active trachoma prevalence observed after the intervention is still very high in the studied areas of North and South Wollo Zones communities. To achieve the global trachoma elimination target by the year 2020 as set by the WHO, continued WaSH interventions and periodic monitoring, evaluation and reporting of the impact of WaSH on active trachoma is warranted...|$|E

Previous vaccination attempts have employed the recombinant major outer membrane protein (MOMP) of C. trachomatis nonetheless, with limited success, perhaps, due to stability, degradation, and delivery issues. In this study we cloned C. trachomatis recombinant MOMP DNA (DMOMP) and encapsulated it in chitosan nanoparticles (DMCNP) using the complex coacervation technique. Physiochemical characterizations of DMCNP included transmission and scanning electron microcopy, Fourier transform infrared and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and zeta potential. Encapsulated DMOMP was 167 – 250 nm, with a uniform spherical shape and homogenous morphology, and an encapsulation efficiency > 90 %. A slow release pattern of encapsulated DMOMP, especially in acidic solution, was observed over 7 days. The zeta potential of DMCNP was ~ 8. 80 mV, which indicated that it was highly stable. Toxicity studies of DMCNP (25 – 400 µg/mL) to Cos- 7 cells using the MTT assay revealed minimal toxicity over 24 – 72 hours with > 90 % viable cells. Ultra-violet visible (UV-vis) spectra indicated encapsulated DMOMP protection by chitosan, whereas agarose gel electrophoresis verified its protection from enzymatic degradation. Expression of MOMP protein in DMCNP-transfected Cos- 7 cells was demonstrated via Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. Significantly, intramuscular injection of BALB/c mice with DMCNP confirmed the delivery of encapsulated DMOMP, and expression of the MOMP gene transcript in thigh muscles and spleens. Our data show that encapsulation of DMOMP in biodegradable chitosan nanoparticles imparts stability and protection from enzymatic digestion, and enhances delivery and expression of DMOMP in vitro and in mice. Further investigations of the nanoencapsulated DMCNP vaccine formulation against C. trachomatis in mice are warranted.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the ability of}} mice made genetically deficient for B cells to resolve a primary infection and to develop protective immunity against vaginal challenge with a human isolate of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> <b>bacteria.</b> The B-cell-deficient microMT mice cleared a primary ascending infection with similar or faster kinetics compared with wild-type mice. The presence of chlamydial inclusion bodies {{and the degree of}} inflammation in the upper genital tract was comparable and showed similar kinetics in microMT as in wild-type mice. Following resolution of the primary infection the mice were challenged by 100 ID 50 of live bacteria and the level of protection and the extent of local inflammation was assessed. Strikingly, all microMT mice, as well as most of the wild-type mice, demonstrated complete immune protection with no bacterial shedding. While high titres of chlamydia-specific antibodies were stimulated locally and systemically in wild-type mice, no antibodies were detected in microMT mice. However, in both strains, immunohistochemical analysis of the upper genital tract demonstrated the presence of large numbers of CD 4 + T cells and increased levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) -producing cells. The results unequivocally demonstrate that antibodies are not required for full protection to develop against ascending infection with a high dose of C. trachomatis in the female genital tract. Our study confirms the notion that cell-mediated immunity, in particular that owing to CD 4 + T helper I (Th 1) -type cells, is critical for host resistance against C. trachomatis in mice...|$|R

Herein we evaluated the immune-potentiating potential of PLGA by encapsulating the full-length rMOMP (PLGA-rMOMP), characterizing it in vitro, and investigating its immunogenicity in vivo. Our hypothesis was that PLGA-rMOMP triggers Th 1 immune responses in mice, which are desirable prerequisites for a C. trachomatis candidate nanovaccine. Physical-structural characterizations of PLGA-rMOMP revealed its size (approximately 272 nm), zeta potential (− 14. 30 mV), apparent spherical smooth morphology, and continuous slow release pattern. PLGA potentiated the ability of encapsulated rMOMP to trigger production of cytokines and chemokines by mouse J 774 macrophages. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that spleen cells from BALB/c mice immunized with PLGA-rMOMP had elevated numbers of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell subsets, and secreted more rMOMP-specific interferon-gamma (Th 1) and interleukin (IL) - 12 p 40 (Th 1 /Th 17) than IL- 4 and IL- 10 (Th 2) cytokines. PLGA-rMOMP-immunized mice produced higher serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgG 2 a (Th 1) than IgG 1 (Th 2) rMOMP-specific antibodies. Notably, sera from PLGA-rMOMP-immunized mice had a 64 -fold higher Th 1 than Th 2 antibody titer, whereas mice immunized with rMOMP in Freund&# 39;s adjuvant had only a four-fold higher Th 1 than Th 2 antibody titer, suggesting primarily induction of a Th 1 antibody response in PLGA-rMOMP-immunized mice. Our data underscore PLGA as an effective delivery system for a C. trachomatis vaccine. The capacity of PLGA-rMOMP to trigger primarily Th 1 immune responses in mice promotes it as a highly desirable candidate nanovaccine against C. <b>trachomatis.</b> Keywords: <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis,</b> <b>bacteria,</b> vaccine, antibody, cytokines, PLGA nanoparticles ...|$|R

We conducted a cross-sectional survey of children aged 1 - 9 years in communities in Achham District in early 2014 including clinical examination validated with photographs, conjunctival samples for <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> (Amplicor PCR), and serological testing for antibodies against <b>chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> protein antigens pgp 3 and CT 694 using the Luminex platform. In 24 randomly selected communities, the prevalence of trachoma (TF and/or TI) in 1 - 9 year olds was 3 / 1124 (0. 3 %, 95 % CI 0. 1 to 0. 8 %), and the prevalence of ocular <b>chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> infection was 0 / 1124 (0 %, 95 % CI 0 to 0. 3 %). In 18 communities selected because they had the highest prevalence of trachoma in a previous survey, the prevalence of TF and/or TI was 7 / 716 (1. 0 %, 95 % CI 0. 4 to 2. 0 %) and the prevalence of ocular <b>chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> infection was 0 / 716 (0 %, 95 % CI 0 to 0. 5 %). In 3 communities selected for serological testing, the prevalence of trachoma was 0 / 68 (0 %, 95 % CI 0 to 5. 3 %), the prevalence of ocular <b>chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> infection was 0 / 68 (0 %, 95 % CI 0 to 0. 5 %), the prevalence of antibodies against <b>chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> protein antigen pgp 3 was 1 / 68 (1. 5 %, 95 % CI 0. 04 % to 7. 9 %), and the prevalence of antibodies against <b>chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> protein antigen CT 694 was 0 / 68 (0 %, 95 % CI 0 to 5. 3 %). This previously highly endemic district in Nepal has little evidence of recent clinical disease, <b>chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> infection, or serological evidence of trachoma, suggesting that epidemiological control has been achieved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis,</b> an obligate {{intracellular}} human pathogen, is {{the most}} prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infection worldwide and {{a leading cause of}} preventable blindness. HtrA is a virulence and stress response periplasmic serine protease and molecular chaperone found in many bacteria. Recombinant purified C. trachomatis HtrA has been previously shown to have both activities. This investigation examined the physiological role of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> HtrA. Results The <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> htrA gene complemented the lethal high temperature phenotype of Escherichia coli htrA - (> 42 °C). HtrA levels were detected to increase by western blot and immunofluorescence during Chlamydia heat shock experiments. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed a likely periplasmic localisation of HtrA. During penicillin induced persistence of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis,</b> HtrA levels (as a ratio of LPS) were initially less than control acute cultures (20 h post infection) but increased to more than acute cultures at 44 h post infection. This was unlike IFN-γ persistence where lower levels of HtrA were observed, suggesting <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> IFN-γ persistence does not involve a broad stress response. Conclusion The heterologous heat shock protection for Escherichia coli, and increased HtrA during cell wall disruption via penicillin and heat shock, indicates an important role for HtrA during high protein stress conditions for <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{diseases}} as sexually transferred in world. According to the World Health Organization statistics, approximately 92 million new <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> infection occur in the world. <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> (CT) is the cause of tubal obstruction, ectopic pregnancy and infertility in women. The aim of this study is prevalence evaluation of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>Trachomatis</b> by PCR in female infertile referred to Montasarieh study center of infertility in Mashhad. Materials and Methods: The cervical swab specimens were collected from 100 infertile (as case) and 30 fertile (as control group) women attending to the infertility center of Mash-had Medical University.

40|$|ELISA <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> and Listeria monocytogenes are {{important}} reproductive tract pathogens {{in a wide}} variety of animals including sheep. In humans, chronic or repeated infection of the female genital tract with <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> has been identified as a significant factor in the development of occlusive infertility or increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. The aim of the current study is to detect circulating immunoglobulins in serum of sheep naturally infected with <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> and Listeria monocytogenes in two Egyptian provinces. A total of 82 serum samples from 4 sheep flocks in two Egyptian provinces were examined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of antibodies of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> and Listeria monocytogenes. The results of ELISA revealed the detection of antibodies against the two pathogens at a very high percentage (98. 78 % and 100 % for <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> and Listeria monocytogenes, respectively) despite of absence of elevated abortion rates in the examined sheep flocks. It could be concluded that chlamydial and listerial infections occur frequently in Egyptian sheep flocks, even in the absence of elevated abortion rates and there is possible risk to pregnant women in rural areas where chlamydial and listerial infections in farm animals are widespread. Also, ewes that experienced <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> or Listeria monocytogenes induced abortion provid...|$|R
40|$|The role of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> in the {{pathogenesis}} of Pelvic inflammatory disease and majority of cases of salpinigitis are well acknowledged in women. A total of 213 sera from infertile women were tested for antibodies to <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> by using an indirect solid phases enzyme Immuno absorbent commercial ELISA test. Women with confirmed Hysterosalpinographic report suggesting tubal occlusion (tubal factor infertility) had 92 (43. 2 %) followed by 63 (29. 6 %) infertile women with infertile male partner and 58 (27. 2 %) were having unexplained infertility. Out of the tubal factor (TF) infertile women 40 (18. 8 %) were seropositive for <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> antibodies, as against 19 (8. 9 %) {{in the group of}} women with normal patent tubes and 10 (4. 6 %) women with infertile male partner. In this study there was a statistical significant correlation between the infertile women with tubal factor infertility in relation to seroevidence of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> infection with p< 0. 05. There was no age bias in the serodetection of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> antibodies. The seropositivity of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> is an indication that the organism may be an independent risk factor in the development of an inflammatory process leading to scaring of the uterine tubes in women and thereby causing infertility...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our research}} {{was to determine the}} presence of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> in the women’s urethra in patients with an infection of cervix but without symptoms for a urinary infection. The study included 74 patients, 46 (62 %) of which had subjective symptoms and 28 patients (38 %) that didn’t have subjective symptoms for a genital infection. Urethral and cervical swabs were taken from all the patients included in the study. <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> was isolated from 18 patients (24. 3 %). Of these 18 patients, 10 patients had symptoms for a genital infection and 8 patients didn’t have symptoms for a genital infection. <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> was detected both in cervix uteri and the urethra in 16 patients, only in cervix uteri in one patient and only in the urethra in one patient. The obtained data shows that there is {{no significant difference in the}} presence of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> in the groups of patients with and without symptoms for a genital infection, as well as a high degree of correlation between the presence of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> in the urethra and cervix uteri, which in turn allows the introduction of the method of taking a urethral swab to detect <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> as a screening method...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Little {{is known}} about the {{susceptibility}} of posterior segment tissues, particularly the human retinal pigment epithelium (hRPE), to <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis.</b> The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate the possibility of infecting the hRPE with <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis,</b> and to exam-ine the infectivity of different <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> clinical isolates for hRPE cells and the hRPE cell response to the infection. Methods Cultured hRPE and McCoy cells were inoculated with eight <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> (serovar E) clinical isolates at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2. 0 or 0. 3. To detect Chlamydia tracho-matis, samples were stained immunohistochemically with anti-major outer membrane pro-tein antibodies at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h postinoculation (PI).

The {{aim of this}} study is to evaluate the prevalence of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> and HPV co-infection in different cohorts of asymptomatic women from a Northern Italy area at high incidence for cervical cancer. Cervical samples from 441 females were collected from Cervical Cancer Screening Program, Sexually Transmitted Infectious and Assisted Reproductive Technology centres. HPV and <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> were detected simultaneously and genotyped using a highly sensitive bead based assay. The overall prevalence of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> was estimated 9. 7 %, in contrast with the reported national data of 2. 3 %, and co-infection with HPV was diagnosed in the 17 % of the samples. In females ≤[*] 25 years of age, the infection reached a peak of 22 % and co-infection with HPV of 45. 8 % (P[*]<[*] 0. 001). Of note, in young females diagnosed with low grade cervical lesions, no significant difference between <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> and HPV distribution was observed, while differently, HPV co-infection was found significantly associated to the presence of intraepithelial lesions when compared to older females (20 % vs. 1 %; P[*]<[*] 0. 001). In this study, the use of a high sensitive molecular technique exhibited higher analytical sensitivity than the referred assays for the diagnosis of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> and HPV co-infection in asymptomatic females, leading to reduction of the potential to identify incorrectly the infection status. An active screening for timely treatment of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>trachomatis</b> infection is suggested in young females to evaluate a possible decrease in incidence of pre-cancer intraepithelial lesions...|$|R
