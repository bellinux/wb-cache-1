40|$|The vial capping {{process is}} a {{critical}} unit operation during drug product manufacturing, as it could possibly generate cosmetic defects or even affect container closure integrity. Yet there is significant variability in capping equipment and processes, and their relation to potential defects or container closure integrity has not been thoroughly studied. In this study we applied several methods-residual seal force tester, a self-developed system of a piezo force sensor measurement, and computed tomography-to characterize different <b>container</b> <b>closure</b> <b>system</b> combinations that had been sealed using different capping process parameter settings. Additionally, container closure integrity of these samples was measured using helium leakage (physical container closure integrity) and compared to characterization data. The different capping equipment settings lead to residual seal force values from 7 to 115 N. High residual seal force values were achieved with high capping pre-compression force and a short distance between the capping plate and plunge. The choice of <b>container</b> <b>closure</b> <b>system</b> influenced the obtained residual seal force values. The residual seal force tester and piezoelectric measurements showed similar trends. All vials passed physical container closure integrity testing, and no stopper rupture was seen {{with any of the}} settings applied, suggesting that container closure integrity was warranted for the studied <b>container</b> <b>closure</b> <b>system</b> with the chosen capping setting ranges...|$|E

40|$|Capping {{equipment}} used in {{good manufacturing practice}} manufacturing features different designs {{and a variety of}} adjustable process parameters. The overall capping result is a complex interplay of the different capping process parameters and is insufficiently described in literature. It remains poorly studied how the different capping equipment designs and capping equipment process parameters (e. g., pre-compression force, capping plate height, turntable rotating speed) contribute to the final residual seal force of a sealed <b>container</b> <b>closure</b> <b>system</b> and its relation to container closure integrity and other drug product quality parameters. Stopper compression measured by computer tomography correlated to residual seal force measurements. In our studies, we used different <b>container</b> <b>closure</b> <b>system</b> configurations from different good manufacturing practice drug product fill & finish facilities to investigate the influence of differences in primary packaging, that is, vial size and rubber stopper design on the capping process and the capped drug product. In addition, we compared two large-scale good manufacturing practice manufacturing capping equipment and different capping equipment settings and their impact on product quality and integrity, as determined by residual seal force. The capping plate to plunger distance had a major influence on the obtained residual seal force values of a sealed vial, whereas the capping pre-compression force and the turntable rotation speed showed only a minor influence on the residual seal force of a sealed vial. Capping process parameters could not easily be transferred from capping equipment of different manufacturers. However, the residual seal force tester did provide a valuable tool to compare capping performance of different capping equipment. No vial showed any leakage greater than 10 (- 8) mbar L/s as measured by a helium mass spectrometry system, suggesting that container closure integrity was warranted in the residual seal force range tested for the tested container closure systems.

The method proposed by United States Pharmacopeia was used to determine concentrations of methylprednisolone, as the sum of the concentration of methylprednisolone esters (17 -hydrogen succinate and 21 -hydrogen succinate) and free methylprednisolone. The HPLC method was used for stability evaluation of the active substance and determination of related substances. Four main degradation products were registered. Temperature has a major impact on the degradation process with the appearance of 3 degradation products (impurities B, C and D), while the presence of light caused an increasing content of impurity A.

40|$|The {{availability}} of licensed paediatric drugs is lagging behind those for adults, {{and there is}} a lack of safe formulations in suitable doses that children are able and willing to take. As a consequence, children are commonly treated with off-label or unlicensed drugs. As off-label and unlicensed drug use are associated with a greater risk for harm than on-label drug use, a range of global initiatives have been developed to realize "better" medicines for children. This review describes the challenges and achievements of the European Union to realize this goal, with a focus on paediatric drug development and formulation design. In 2007, a European Paediatric Regulation was installed enforcing companies to consider children in the early development of drugs with a new drug substance, for a new indication or with a new route of administration. The Regulation, e. g. requires companies to develop a paediatric investigation plan discussing the proposed clinical trials in children of different ages and the formulations for future marketing. Since 2013, the pharmaceutical design of any newly marketed paediatric drug should comply with the "Guideline on the Pharmaceutical Development of Medicines for Paediatric Use. " Companies should, e. g. justify the route of administration, dosage form, formulation characteristics, safety of excipients, dosing frequency, <b>container</b> <b>closure</b> <b>system,</b> administration device, patient acceptability and user information. In this review, the guideline's key aspects are discussed with a focus on novel formulations such as mini-tablets and orodispersible films, excipients with a potential risk for harm such as azo dyes and adequate user instructions...|$|E
30|$|Regulatory agency {{expectations}} were discussed. The purpose of stability studies {{is to ensure}} the safety and efficacy of product through shelf-life. As required in 21 CFR 211.166, “There shall be a written testing program designed to assess the stability characteristics of drug products. The results of such stability testing shall be used in determining appropriate storage conditions and expiration dates.” Both FDA and ICH published a couple of guidances for industry. The types of stability studies includes studies supporting label storage, accelerated stability studies, and stress/forced degradation studies. It is desirable to perform the stress/forced degradation studies during phase 1 and phase 2, and it is a regulatory expectation that such data will be available during phase 3 trials. It is a common practice to place the toxicology and the first GMP lot on stability studies, to collect the stability data throughout the clinical development to support licensure. To propose the product shelf-life, stability data from at least 3 lots representative of commercial process stored in commercial containers should been collected. The ongoing stability studies should be completed according to the stability protocol post approval. The <b>container</b> <b>closure</b> <b>system</b> (CCS) also needs to be approved for compatibility with drug products, with minimal leachable and no impact on to product quality and safety. In-use stability studies support the stability of the product under actual conditions of use. Stability of drug substance, drug product and any process intermediates are expected after shipping in the intended commercial supply chain. Additional stability should be performed for process intermediates during the manufacturing process, raw materials, and reference standards, etc.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the <b>container</b> <b>closure</b> <b>system</b> on the stability of an atropine sulfate solution was studied. Therefore a model-solution was filled into different container closure systems {{similar to those used}} by the German armed forces as autoinjectors against nerve agent poisoning. These containers were stored at 40, 50 and 60 °C for up to twelve months. Samples were removed from the stock and analysed after 1, 3, 5, and 12 months. Data obtained were used to calculate the maximum shelf life of atropine solution stored at ambient temperature in the three reviewed container closures. For the analysis of assay and degradation products a new rapid resolution liquid chromatography (RRLC) method was established. So the analysis time could be shortened to a fifth, from 45 to ten minutes, which makes it a time and solvent saving method. Differences concerning stability of atropine solutions stored in glass, plastic or steel were found. Regarding the shelf life of storing at ambient temperature atropine proofed to be more stable in metal- then in glass- or plastic-cartridges. By testing siliconized as well as not siliconized metal-cartridges, it could be demonstrated that the silicone film also improved drug stability. No {{influence of}} the intermediate packaging material could be detected concerning formation of degradation products. There is no evidence of formation of other degradation products than tropic acid and apoatropine. Great differences were noticed concerning the leachables found in the atropine solution. For example the migration of phenol from the rubber stoppers of the metal-cartridge is much more distinct than from the rubber stopper of the glass-cartridge. The stoppers of the plastic-cartridge, in contrary, do not release phenol. In addition, different amounts of the preservatives from the silicone emulsion used for passivation of the cartridges can be detected in the atropine solutions. But in general there can be found only traces of them. By storing the components of the container closure systems in a citrate buffer which is like that used for the atropine solution it was confirmed that those parts that had been heated after siliconization do not release constituents of the silicone emulsion to the buffer solution. Besides those leachables, other signals can be detected in the HPLC chromatograms of the tested solutions that could not be identified yet. Their presence depends on the duration of storage, the storage temperature and on the container closure. Presumably, these signals are caused by leachables from the packaging material but they still have to be identified during further analyses...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to better understand the heat and mass transfer in freeze drying process and use this understanding to develop better guidelines for rational design, development and scale-up of freeze drying process. The main objective of a rational design of the freeze drying process is to obtain a stable and elegant product with minimal intra- and inter-batch variability. In addition, the designed freeze drying process should be robust and easily scaleable and transferable from one lyophilizer to another. During process development, there exist a number of manufacturing challenges such as differences in loading room environment, equipment design and capacity, load/batch size, <b>container</b> <b>closure</b> <b>system,</b> which needs to be taken into consideration during lyophilization cycle development and scale-up. ^ Variations in degree of supercooling between laboratory and production scale freeze-dryer results in differences in product temperature and drying time. To achieve homogeneous drying rate, the ice nucleation temperature for product vials within the same batch was controlled by using the reduced pressure ice fog technique. ^ Since primary drying is the longest step, optimization of this step is the focus in industry. Several analytical techniques (comparative pressure measurement (Pirani vs. Capacitance Manometer), dewpoint monitor, Tunable Diode Laser Absoprtion Spectroscopy (TDLAS), Lyotrack (Gas Plasma Spectroscopy), condenser pressure, pressure rise test, and product thermocouple were compared to determine the end point of primary drying. Besides being inexpensive, the midpoint of drop in the Pirani pressure is a good indicator of the end point of primary drying. ^ Further, gas flow dynamics in the duct connecting the chamber and the condenser imposes an upper limit to the maximum sublimation rate that a given lyophilizer can handle. At a fixed chamber pressure sublimation rate increases as the condenser pressure decreases. However, sublimation rate increases only until the gas flow velocity reaches Mach I limit (at which gas velocity equals speed of sound) at the duct exit. Further increase in sublimation rate results in loss of chamber pressure control (i. e., choked flow). From the sublimation test, choked flow was observed experimentally for the pressure range studied (60 - 200 mTorr) at different shelf temperature set point. Also, the Fluent simulation results predicted that the gas flow velocity reaches the speed of sound (i. e., Mach I limit) at the duct exit under the experimental conditions studied resulting in loss in chamber pressure control. ^ Key process parameters such as product temperature and drying time were significantly effected under different load conditions on a laboratory, pilot as well as a clinical scale freeze-dryer. Under partial load conditions, radiation effects dominate as the fraction of edge vials, which experience higher heat transfer via radiation, increases as the load on the shelf decreases. For an optimized process, even at 50 % of full load condition, cycle adjustments are required to achieve same product temperature profile as at 100 % of full load. ^ The container-closure system is another important variable during freeze-drying. There are freezing as well as drying difference between traditional containers (i. e., glass tubing vials) and glass syringes. An aluminum block holder system improved the heat and mass transfer compared to a plexiglass holder for freeze-drying in syringes. ^ The steady state theory of heat and mass transfer in freeze-drying was used to interpret the experimental data from various process development and scale up experiments and to make adjustments in cycles in different dryers to obtain equivalent product thermal histories. Further, general guidelines were developed to help in rational design, development and scale-up of the freeze-drying process. ...|$|E

30|$|To {{maintain}} the sterility of cultures, {{it is essential}} to close culture <b>containers</b> with some <b>closure.</b> Different types of <b>container</b> <b>closures</b> are commonly used. Some closures cause restriction of gaseous exchange between the container atmosphere and the outside environment (Buddendorf-Joosten and Woltering [1994]), which can result in poor aeration and hyperhydric condition of cultures. It has been reported that the type of closure affects gaseous exchange, availability of water, micronutrients, and balance of hormones in the culture container (Kataeva et al. [1991]; Lai et al. [2005]; Chen et al. [2006]; Tsay et al. [2006]).

During standard DE of 3013 containers, visual examinations for pitting and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) are performed on the accessible surfaces of the outer, inner, and convenience containers, which make up the 3013 container. As a result of 3013 DE additional analysis, the area near the inner <b>container</b> <b>closure</b> weld has been identified as being a region of increased corrosion susceptibility, which may provide a pathway for corrosive gases to the outer container. This area has a higher residual stress, an altered microstructure, and less corrosion resistant weld oxides {{as a result of the}} welding process as well as a lower temperature than other areas of the container, which may increase the absorption of moisture on the surface. The deposition of moisture in this stressed region could lead to pitting and stress corrosion cracking. During FY 2013, the inner <b>container</b> <b>closure</b> weld area was more closely evaluated on several archived samples from DE containers. These containers included FY 09 DE 2, FY 12 DE 4, FY 12 DE 6 and FY 12 DE 7 and the Hanford High Moisture Container.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{development}} of screening methods for the identification and quantification of plastic additives, their degradation products, residual solvents and degrada-tion products of the polymer materials. After having done comprehensive researches on the subject in literature and communication with different manufacturers of plastics and elastom-ers an overview was compiled about commonly used plastic additives and additionally degra-dation products and residual solvents which often migrate. For volatile extractables and leach-ables a HS-GC-FID was developed and for semi volatile components the GC-MS with direct injection was used. The HPLC-UV and the UPLC-UV-MS were applied for the determination of non volatile compounds. With these screening methods 64 potential extractables like anti-oxidants, UV stabilizers, plasticizers, lubricants, silicone derivates or residual solvents could be identified. By means of selected substances which represented {{a broad range of}} chemical and physical properties it could be shown that these methods are amenable to validation. Solely the contrast medium led to difficulties during validation of the HPLC-UV method caused by the highly concentrated radio-opaque substance which results in overloading of the column. An optimized sample preparation shall avoid these effects. Extraction with non polar solvents could be an opportunity. Additionally extraction methods for the investigation of different plastic and elastomers con-cerning their extractable profiles after extraction with water, isopropanol and hexane were developed. The plastic additives Irganox 1010, BHT, Irganox 1076, MTBC, DEHP, stearic acid, sulphur, as well as residual solvents and degradation products like different tertiary alco-hols (p. a. t-butanole), 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanole, various hydrocarbons (p. a. dodecane, tetradecane, eicosane, tetracosane), Irgafos 168 oxide, palmitic-, myristic acid, benzyls and silicone deri-vates were the commonly extracted substances. These extractable profiles serve as an essential basis for assessing the suitability of materials as primary packaging materials during the development of new <b>container</b> <b>closure</b> <b>systems.</b> Thus COP, COC, PC and PP as plastics and the chlorinated butyl rubbers C and D would be appropriated. The extractable profiles of these materials are least comprehensive. Among these properties additional factors are important during the development of packaging, p. a. process ability and barrier properties. A compromise between these claims shall be identified. Afterwards one’s own hand assembled devices, filled with water or rather contrast medium, was investigated concerning their migration profiles. These devices (cartridges and vials with different composition) were being stored at 40 °C and 75 % relatively humidity for six months. After sterilization, tri- and the storage for six month the devices were investigated with the developed analytical methods. T-butanole, BHT, m-Xylene, o-Xylene, Ethylbenzene and silicone derivates were migrated compounds. With the help of statutory provisions the toxicological assessment didn`t show any health haz-ard neither for water nor for contrast medium as filling. For the assessment of migrated un-known substances the Kunststoffrichtlinie 2002 / 72 /EG was used. According to FDA using regulations from the food sector is possible. Concentrations of known leachables as well as the global migration limits, summarizing concentrations of known and unknown substances were not exceeded. The toxicological risk was estimated being harmless. For unknown sub-stances identification should be conducted to exclude any toxicological risk if a registration as primary packaging material is targeted. When comparing extractable and leachable profiles in many cases a similar screen was shown concerning known compounds. However a quantitative correlation couldn’t be demonstrated. The reason was the use of different moulded articles. The different moulding processes caused an allocation of plastic additives in plastics and elastomers which wasn’t comparable. Within the scope of this work screening methods to investigate plastics and elastomers con-cerning their extractable and leachable profiles has been developed successfully. It is possible to select materials already during the development process considering the potential of migra-tion of the used plastic additives. The following toxicological assessment allows an early de-cision about the suitability as primary packaging material. Caused by the multiplicity of plas-tic additives which are currently on the market and their possibility to create reaction products with the filling it is necessary to adapt or amend the developed methods...|$|R

40|$|AbstractClosure systems (i. e. {{families}} of subsets {{of a set}} S containing S and closed by set intersection) or, equivalently, closure operators and full implicational systems appear in many fields in pure or applied mathematics and computer science. We present a survey of properties of the lattice of <b>closure</b> <b>systems</b> on a finite set S with proofs of the more significant results. In particular we show that this lattice is atomistic and lower bounded and that there exists a canonical basis for the representation of any <b>closure</b> <b>system</b> by “implicational” <b>closure</b> <b>systems.</b> Since the lattices of closure operators and of full implicational systems are anti-isomorphic with the lattice of <b>closure</b> <b>systems</b> they have the dual properties...|$|R
40|$|Frequently, {{the goal}} of a {{pharmaceutical}} company is to develop a globally acceptable registration stability protocol. A sound stability protocol not only eliminates unnecessary testing but also reduces manufacturing needs, cost and time. In this article considerable issues related to development of stability protocol such as type, size and number of batches, type, size and sources of <b>containers</b> and <b>closures,</b> <b>container</b> <b>closures</b> orientation, sampling plan, storage conditions, test time points, test parameters, test methods, acceptance criteria and the applicability of statistical methods for the analysis of stability data is discussed. The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop and outline accelerated stability protocol for Sildenafil tablets acceptable for registration in Europe and highlight some of the considerations that must be made before the execution of actual stability study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Presented {{results are}} {{inspired}} by the study of <b>closure</b> <b>systems</b> with unique critical sets, but many have the general nature. Among those is the statement that every optimum basis of a finite <b>closure</b> <b>system,</b> in D. Maier’s sense, is also right-side optimum, which is a parameter of a minimum CNF representation of a Horn Boolean function. New parameters for {{the size of the}} binary part are also established. As a part of general studies, we introduce the K-basis of a <b>closure</b> <b>system,</b> which is a refinement of the canonical basis of V. Duquenne and J. L. Guigues, and discuss a polynomial algorithm to obtain it. The main part of the paper is devoted to the <b>closure</b> <b>systems</b> with unique critical sets, and some subclasses of these where the K-basis is unique. A further refinement {{in the form of the}} E-basis is possible for <b>closure</b> <b>systems</b> without D-cycles. There is a polynomial algorithm to recognize the D-relation from a K-basis. Thus, <b>closure</b> <b>systems</b> without D-cycles can be effectively recognized. While the E-basis achieves an optimum in one of its parts, the optimization of the others is an NP-complete problem. 1...|$|R
