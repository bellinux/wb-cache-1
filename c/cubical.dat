5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Aureoboletus mirabilis grow solitarily, scattered, or {{sometimes}} {{in small groups}} {{on the ground or}} on well-decayed conifer logs, especially of western and mountain hemlock, but occasionally also Douglas-fir and western red cedar. The fungus is strongly suspected to form mycorrhizal associations with hemlock, although standard attempts at growing B.mirabilis mycorrhizae in laboratory culture have failed. Although fruit bodies are sometimes found growing on logs with advanced brown <b>cubical</b> rot—a trait suggestive of cellulose-decomposing saprobic fungi—the rotten wood harboring the fungi typically contains abundant conifer roots. It has been suggested that B.mirabilis has specifically adapted to this niche to reduce competition for nutrients with other mycorrhizal fungi, and further, that the inability to culture mycorrhizae in the lab using standard techniques may be because certain physical or chemical characteristics of the wood with brown <b>cubical</b> rot are required for fungal growth.|$|E
5|$|Pycnoporellus alboluteus, {{commonly}} known as the orange sponge polypore, is a species of polypore fungus in the family Fomitopsidaceae. Distributed throughout the boreal conifer zone, the fungus is found in mountainous regions of western North America, and in Europe. It causes a brown <b>cubical</b> rot of conifer wood, especially spruce, but also fir and poplar. The soft, spongy orange fruit bodies grow spread out on the surface of fallen logs. Mature specimens have tooth-like or jagged pore edges. A snowbank mushroom, P.alboluteus can often be found growing on logs or stumps protruding through melting snow. Although the edibility of the fungus and its usage for human culinary purposes are unknown, several species of beetles use the fungus as a food source.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} {{converting}} {{the film to}} 3-D was put forth during filming, and was implemented in July 2011 due to a revived interest in 3-D films. The process required 2,600 artists to convert 4,400 shots of the film. The sound design involved bridging the real and the virtual world, and the required sound enhancements were achieved by using the Dolby Surround 7.1 system. Incorporating the visual effects began in April 2010, and was preceded by extensive research. 1,200 artists worked for 2½ years to complete the visual effects work. A number of complex procedures were executed, including <b>cubical</b> transformations and {{the design of the}} faceless form of Ra.One.|$|E
5|$|The sculpture's roughly <b>cubical</b> {{arrangement}} cleverly {{ensures that}} the overall composition retains a harmonious equilibrium. It is lightened by the artist dispensing with a back slab and incorporating negative space into the piece. By putting {{the children in the}} place of Seneb's legs, the artist adds to the sense of symmetry. He creates the same impression that would have been made by an ordinary seated figure, preserving an appearance of normality without disguising Seneb's unusual physique. The family's names and titles are given in inscriptions placed {{on either side of the}} children and on the horizontal face of the base.|$|E
25|$|Gromov {{showed that}} a <b>cubical</b> complex (that is, a family of hypercubes {{intersecting}} face-to-face) forms a CAT(0) space {{if and only if}} the complex is simply connected and the link of every vertex forms a flag complex. A <b>cubical</b> complex meeting these conditions is sometimes called a cubing or a space with walls.|$|E

25|$|The {{latter are}} {{difficult}} (though not impossible) to visualise, but still retain the aesthetically pleasing symmetry of their lower-dimensional cousins. The tesseract contains 8 <b>cubical</b> cells. It {{consists of two}} cubes in parallel hyperplanes with corresponding vertices cross-connected {{in such a way}} that the 8 cross-edges are equal in length and orthogonal to the 12+12 edges situated on each cube. The corresponding faces of the two cubes are connected to form the remaining 6 <b>cubical</b> faces of the tesseract. The 24-cell can be derived from the tesseract by joining the 8 vertices of each of its <b>cubical</b> faces to an additional vertex to form the four-dimensional analogue of a pyramid. Both figures, as well as other 4-dimensional figures, can be directly visualised and depicted using 4-dimensional stereographs.|$|E

25|$|In geometry, the tesseract is the four-dimensional analog of {{the cube}}; the tesseract {{is to the}} cube as the cube is to the square. Just as {{the surface of the}} cube {{consists}} of six square faces, the hypersurface of the tesseract consists of eight <b>cubical</b> cells. The tesseract is one of the six convex regular 4-polytopes.|$|E
25|$|A projecting, one-storey, <b>cubical</b> {{reception}} section {{provides access to}} the nave through a semi-circular arch with iron grillework. This foyer area is sheltered by a hipped Spanish tile roof.

25|$|Although the <b>cubical</b> {{model of}} the atom was soon {{abandoned}} {{in favor of the}} quantum mechanical model based on the Schrödinger equation, and is therefore now principally of historical interest, it represented an important step towards the understanding of the chemical bond. The 1916 article by Lewis also introduced the concept of the electron pair in the covalent bond, the octet rule, and the now-called Lewis structure.|$|E
25|$|The first 8 {{vertices}} are the vertices of {{a regular}} 16-cell and the other 16 are the vertices of the dual tesseract. This gives a construction equivalent to cutting a tesseract into 8 <b>cubical</b> pyramids, and then attaching them to the facets of a second tesseract. This {{is equivalent to the}} dual of a rectified 16-cell. The analogous construction in 3-space gives the rhombic dodecahedron which, however, is not regular.|$|E
25|$|The Manor House, No. 1 Stockton Lane, was {{formerly}} called the New Manor House (OS). It was built before 1830 when William Hornby Esq. (father of Robert Hornby) occupied {{it and it}} appears, with its name, on Robert Cooper's map of 1832. The house is partly of two, partly of three, storeys, above a high semi-basement and is of unusual, nearly <b>cubical,</b> shape. A bay window was added later in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The tomb was {{originally}} {{designed by the}} Iranian architect, Haj Hossein Lurzadeh who aside from Ferdowsi's tomb also created some 842 mosques, {{as well as the}} private palace of Ramsar, part of the decoration of the Marmar palace, the Imam Hossein Mosque in Tehran, the Motahari Mosque, and various parts of the Hazrat-i-Seyyed-o-Shouhada shrine in Karbala, Iraq. The present design of the structure is credited mainly to Karim Taherzadeh, who replaced the old dome-shaped design by Lurzadeh with a modern <b>cubical</b> design.|$|E
25|$|Hrithik's {{enacting}} of {{a ballet}} sequence with a transparent ball was originally {{shot with a}} real ball. However some shots needed to have a CG ball when it was impractical to execute the shot with a real one. In between the sequence, Hrithik lies on the ball to take a 360-degree turn. This was originally shot with a green <b>cubical</b> turntable to give Hrithik the necessary support to do the act and the table had to be replaced with the transparent ball.|$|E
25|$|The station's only exits are at {{the very}} north end {{of all of the}} platforms, where the head house is. Two <b>cubical</b> {{concrete}} stair towers with corner piers are {{at either end of the}} head house, going down to either side of Jerome Avenue at Bainbridge Avenue. The symmetrical windows on the west end are original nine-light casement windows; those on the east have been covered over or replaced. All are flanked with a narrow, wide-silled window similar to those on the north facade. Piers {{are at the}} corners. Murals with patriotic themes have been painted on the sides. At the top, below the gently pitched gabled roof in standing-seam metal, is a polychrome mosaic frieze above three recessed panels.|$|E
25|$|After his death, Cyrus the Great's {{remains were}} interred in his {{capital city of}} Pasargadae, where today his {{limestone}} tomb (built around 540–530 B.C.E.) still exists. The translated ancient accounts give a vivid description of the tomb both geometrically and aesthetically; The tomb's geometric shape has changed little over the years, still maintaining a large stone of quadrangular form at the base (forty five feet by forty two feet), followed by a pyramidal succession of seven, irregular smaller rectangular stones (possibly as {{a reference to the}} seven planets of the solar system) reaching a height of eighteen feet, until the structure is curtailed by a rectangularly formed <b>cubical</b> edifice with a small opening or window on the side, where the slenderest man can barely squeeze through. The roof of the edifice and indeed the structure, is an elongated limestone pediment.|$|E
25|$|The τάβλη of Zeno's time is {{believed}} to be a direct descendant of the earlier Roman Ludus duodecim scriptorum ("Game of twelve lines") with that board's middle row of points removed, and only the two outer rows remaining. Ludus duodecim scriptorum used a board with three rows of 12 points each with the 15 checkers being moved in opposing directions by the two players across three rows according to the roll of the three <b>cubical</b> dice. Little specific text about the gameplay of Ludus duodecim scriptorum has survived; it may have been related to the older Ancient Greek dice game Kubeia. The earliest known mention of the game is in Ovid's Ars Amatoria (The Art of Love) (written between 1 BC and 8 AD). In Roman times this game was also known as alea, and a likely apocryphal Latin story linked this name, and the game, to a Trojan soldier named Alea.|$|E
25|$|This enigmatic {{structure}} stands erect around 12.5 meters tall (~ 35 feet), with a linear, <b>cubical</b> {{shape and}} a square base (~ 22 feet in sides), constructed {{in what is}} essentially a dug out rectangular depression, having on {{all but one of}} its sides, four rectangular depressions resembling blind windows, and multiple minute rectangular depressions in the façade interdispersed among the blind windows as well as the side housing the staircase. The staircase leads to a small door (5 feet by 6 feet in dimensions) opening to an interior apartment of about 12 feet square. The structure's roof houses a minimal entablature of a repeating square pattern. The entire structure is posited on a raised stone platform that is composed of a few stone slabs, in a sequentially smaller yet in a concentric, pyramidally shaped succession. This structure is enigmatic, both in its aesthetic choice seen in its rather odd design, and façade, as well as its location, and supposed function.|$|E
25|$|Stallings proved {{this result}} {{in a series of}} works, first dealing with the torsion-free case (that is, a group with no nontrivial {{elements}} of finite order) and then with the general case. Stalling's theorem yielded a positive solution to the long-standing open problem about characterizing finitely generated groups of cohomological dimension one as exactly the free groups. Stallings' theorem about ends of groups {{is considered one of the}} first results in geometric group theory proper since it connects a geometric property of a group (having more than one end) with its algebraic structure (admitting a splitting over a finite subgroup). Stallings' theorem spawned many subsequent alternative proofs by other mathematicians (e.g.) as well as many applications (e.g.). The theorem also motivated several generalizations and relative versions of Stallings' result to other contexts, such as the study of the notion of relative ends of a group with respect to a subgroup, including a connection to CAT(0) <b>cubical</b> complexes. A comprehensive survey discussing, in particular, numerous applications and generalizations of Stallings' theorem, is given in a 2003 paper of Wall.|$|E
25|$|From their later investigations, {{police and}} {{forensic}} experts concluded all the victims {{found in the}} cellar at 25 Cromwell Street had been murdered in this location, and that, like Gough, each had been dismembered in this location. Five victims were murdered and buried in the cellar at Cromwell Street between November 1973 and April 1975. The first of these victims, 15-year-old Carol Ann Cooper, was abducted on 10 November 1973. Cooper lived in the Pines Children's Home in Worcester, and was abducted after spending the evening at a cinema with her boyfriend. She {{had been waiting for}} a bus in Warndon when she vanished, and was likely dragged into Fred's car, where her face was bound with surgical tape and her arms bound with braiding cloth before she was driven to Cromwell Street. At the Wests' address, Cooper was suspended from the wooden beams of the cellar ceiling before her abuse and murder. As had been the case with Lynda, Cooper either {{died as a result of}} strangulation or asphyxiation before her dismembered body was buried in a shallow, <b>cubical</b> grave in the cellar.|$|E
25|$|VSI crushers use a {{different}} approach involving a high speed rotor with wear resistant tips and a crushing chamber designed to 'throw' the rock against. The VSI crushers utilize velocity rather than surface force as the predominant force to break rock. In its natural state, rock has a jagged and uneven surface. Applying surface force (pressure) results in unpredictable and typically non-cubical resulting particles. Utilizing velocity rather than surface force allows the breaking force to be applied evenly both {{across the surface of}} the rock as well as through the mass of the rock. Rock, regardless of size, has natural fissures (faults) throughout its structure. As rock is 'thrown' by a VSI Rotor against a solid anvil, it fractures and breaks along these fissures. Final particle size can be controlled by 1) the velocity at which the rock is thrown against the anvil and 2) the distance between the end of the rotor and the impact point on the anvil. The product resulting from VSI Crushing is generally of a consistent <b>cubical</b> shape such as that required by modern SUPERPAVE highway asphalt applications. Using this method also allows materials with much higher abrasiveness to be crushed than is capable with an HSI and most other crushing methods.|$|E

The fungus has a circumpolar distribution, and is found in the boreal conifer zone, particularly in the montane zone, [...] In North America, the fruit bodies begin growth under snow in the spring, continuing until midsummer, while in Europe, it is usually encountered in autumn. It is abundant in the Rocky Mountain region of North America, but rare in the eastern United States and Canada. As a timberline fungus subject to high altitudes, the fruit bodies are subjected to bright light, high winds, and low relative humidity, all of which have a drying effect. They counteract these extremes by absorbing water quickly, and drying slowly.|$|E

500|$|The tower house {{measures}} [...] by [...] on a skewed rectangular plan. The lower two storeys {{comprise the}} oldest {{part of the}} castle, which can be dated to around 1200, while the upper parts are of the 15th century. The date for the original building is based on several pieces of evidence. The <b>cubical</b> blocks of masonry, the flat buttress at the north-east, and the splaying, or widening, of {{the base of the}} walls, are all indicative of this date. The collapsed part of the south wall also formerly contained an early 13th-century style double-lancet window. The original structure, of a type known as a hall house, was probably of two or three storeys, comprising a first-floor hall over an unvaulted basement, and may have been surrounded by a defensive timber stockade or enclosure. The 15th-century rebuilding added two upper floors, and rearranged the interior. Vaulted basements, including a kitchen, and a spiral stair were inserted, and the heightened wall was topped by a parapet with machicolations; spaces through which objects could be dropped on attackers {{at the base of the}} wall. The tower suffered major collapses in 1844 and 1919, and today just the basement survives, with only a small section of the south-east wall standing to its full height.|$|E
500|$|The {{manufacturing}} processes {{of both the}} boxes and the parchment scrolls are intricate and governed by hundreds of detailed rules. In earlier Talmudic times, tefillin were either cylindrical or <b>cubical,</b> but later the cylindrical form became obsolete. Nowadays the boxes should be fashioned from {{a single piece of}} animal hide and form a base with an upper compartment to contain the parchment scrolls. They are made in varying levels of quality. The most basic form, called peshutim ("simple"), are made using several pieces of parchment to form the inner walls of the head tefillin. The higher quality tefillin, namely dakkot ("thin"), made by stretching a thin piece of leather, and the more durable gassot ("thick") are both fashioned from the single piece of hide. Black leather straps (retsu'ot) pass through the rear of the base and are used to secure the tefillin onto the body. On both sides of the head-tefillin, the Hebrew letter shin (...) is moulded; the shin on the wearer's left side has four branches instead of three. The knot of the head-tefillin strap forms the letter dalet (...) or double dalet (...) (known as the square-knot) while the strap that is passed through the arm-tefillin is formed into a knot {{in the shape of the}} letter yud (...) [...] These three letters spell Shaddai (...) , one of the names of God.|$|E
