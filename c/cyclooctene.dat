30|$|We {{demonstrated}} that the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of 3 -substituted <b>cyclooctenes</b> bearing polar substituents allows the synthesis of highly regio- and stereo-regular polymers. A series of polyalkenamers with 90 – 99  % head-to-tail/trans configuration were synthetized in good yields (33 – 87  % yield). Upon saturation of the backbone using diimide, these polymers represent a class of linear polyethylene derivatives where the polar side chain is located on every eighth carbon. The thermal properties of both the saturated and unsaturated polymers depend strongly on the size and polarity of the functional side groups.

A consideration of models and calculations suggests that the ground state conformation is a twist boat–chair, that the former process is a pseudorotation through a chair–chair conformation, and that the latter is a pseudorotation through boat–boat conformations. Both pseudorotations are necessary to achieve ring inversion, i. e. the interconversion of enantiomeric conformations, so inevitably ring inversion will always have the higher of the two barriers measured. However, the rate determining pseudorotation may change as the size or rigidity of the 1 -substituent increases.

Formation of HT-poly(3 -RCOE) employing 1 c takes place via propagating species in which the R group (methyl, hexyl, or phenyl) is on C 2 of the propagating alkylidene chain, a type of intermediate that has been modeled through the preparation of W(N-t-Bu) (CHCHMeEt) (Pyr) (OHMT). The rate of ROMP is exceedingly sensitive to steric factors: e. g., W(N-t-Bu) (CH-t-Bu) (Me[subscript 2]Pyr) (OHMT), the dimethylpyrrolide analogue of 1 c, essentially did not polymerize 3 -HexCOE at 22 °C.

In Chapter 1, the recently developed aqueous ROMP was exploited in the synthesis of a polymer with pendant imide groups.

The resultant high molecular weight polymer was isolated in high yield, exhibited a [ [...] . ], and was thermally stable up to [ [...] . ]. Hydrogenation of the polymer yielded its saturated analog which exhibited a lower [ [...] . ] but a higher temperature of decomposition [ [...] . ]. Requirements for successful polymerization were investigated.

40|$|Text {{abstract}} Background Glycosidases {{are involved}} in several metabolic pathways {{and the development of}} inhibitors is an important challenge towards the treatment of diseases, such as diabetes, cancer and viral infections including AIDS. Thus, inhibition of intestinal α-glucosidases can be used to treat diabetes through the lowering of blood glucose levels, and α-glucosidase inhibitors are being marketed against type 2 (non-insulinodependent mellitus) diabetes (i. e. : Glyset ® or Diastabol ®, Basen ® and Glucor ® or Precose ®). Results In that context, new C 8 -carbasugars and related aminocyclitols have been targeted in order to study the effect of the enhanced flexibility and of the new spatial distribution displayed by these structures on their adaptability in the active site of the enzymes. The synthesis of these new C 8 -glycomimetics is described from enantiomerically pure C 2 -symmetrical polyhydroxylated <b>cyclooctenes.</b> Their obtention notably involved a syn -dihydroxylation, and more extended functionalization through formation of a cis -cyclic sulfate followed by amination and subsequent reductive amination. This strategy involving the nucleophilic opening of a cis -cyclic sulfate by sodium azide is to our knowledge the first example in C 8 -series. It revealead to be an efficient alternative to the nucleoplilic opening of an epoxide moiety which proved unsuccessful in this particular case, due to the hindered conformation of such epoxides as demonstrated by X-ray cristallographic analysis. Conclusion The biological activity of the synthesized glycomimetics has been evaluated towards 24 commercially available glycosidases. The weak observed activities can probably be related to the spatial disposition of the hydroxy and amino groups which depart too much from that realized in glycomimetics such as valiolamine, voglibose and valienamine. Nevertheless, the synthetic strategy described here is efficient and general, and could be extended to increase the diversity of the glycosidase inhibitors obtained since this diversity is introduced in an ultimate step of the synthesis. </p...|$|R

Methyl(trimethylsilyl) methylsilylene gave 1, 1, 3 -trimethyl- 1, 3 -disilacyclobutane in good yield. Vinyl-methyl- and (beta) -styrylmethylsilylene afforded methylsilylacetylene and 1 -methyl- 1 -silaindene, respectively, in moderate yields. In contrast, cyclopentadienylmethylsilylene failed to afford identifiable products;Addition of dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate to 1, 1 -dimethyl- 2, 5 -diphenylsilole afforded 1, 2 -dicarbomethoxy- 3, 6 -diphenyl- 7, 7 -dimethyl- 7 -silanorbornadiene in good yield in CCl(, 4) in the absence of O(, 2). In the presence of O(, 2) or upon heating in the absence of O(, 2) this compound rearranged by a 1, 5 -silyl migration from carbon to oxygen to afford a bicyclo-O-silyl-O-alkylketenacetal. This isomerization was found to be general for 7 -silanorbornadienes containing a carbonyl functionality at the one position. In addition, the previously reported chemistry of a number of 7 -silanorbornadienes was clarified and corrected;The synthesis and chemistry of a number of alkenyl-substituted silyl radicals were examined. Flash-vacuum-pyrolysis of allyl-, 3 -butenyl, and 4 -pentenyldimethylsilane afforded the same products, which were proposed to arise by a series of nonselective bond homolysis reactions followed by bimolecular coupling reactions. Generation of alkenyl-substituted silyl radicals by hydrogen abstraction or mercury-sensitized photolysis of the corresponding silyl hydrides afforded oligomers rather than compounds derived by intramolecular cyclization...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{catalytic}} properties of the iron-complexes [Fe(BMdiPhIK) Cl 2] [1] and [Fe(BMdiPhIK) 2](OTf) 2 [2] is performed in the oxidation of <b>cyclooctene,</b> cyclohexane, styrene, chalcone and dimethylfumarate. The oxidation is mostly carried out at substrate limiting conditions with H 2 O 2 as main oxidant and a 2. 0 mol% catalyst loading {{with respect to the}} substrate. This oxidation reaction has chemical relevance because hydrocarbons are transformed into building blocks used {{in a wide range of}} chemical reactions. Poor activity is observed in the oxidation of these substrates catalyzed by [1] and [2]. <b>Cyclooctene</b> is converted to <b>cyclooctene</b> epoxide with a yield of 3. 4 % by [1] and with a yield of 4. 4 % by [2], which are the best results of all substrates. Cis-dihydroxylation is not observed, but due analysis difficulties cis-dihydroxylation could only be excluded in the oxidation of <b>cyclooctene.</b> The activity of [1] and [2] towards other types of oxidations is tested in the oxidation of benzylalcohol, but also poor activity is observed in the benzaldehyde formation. In general no difference was observed between [1] and [2] and addition of AcOH neither had increasing nor decreasing effects. Two studies are performed towards the properties of [1] and [2] to explain the low catalytic activity: synthesizing a complex of the BMdiPhIK ligand and an Fe(III) -precursor and researching the saturation of [1] and [2] by bringing in the extra ligand SCN-. As these experiments are not analyzed extensively enough, no explanation can be given...|$|E
40|$|A new {{chemical}} process is {{proposed for the}} oxidation of cyclic olefins, such as <b>cyclooctene</b> and cyclododecene, to cyclic ketones {{in the presence of}} hydrogen peroxide and a catalytic system based on tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(0) (Pd(PPh 3) (4)). The kinetic equation of the <b>cyclooctene</b> oxidation can be expressed by r(olefin) = k[olefin]([catalyst] - k'[H+](1. 7)). Note that the reaction rate increases linearly with catalyst and olefin concentration and depends on the H+ concentration. The catalyst retains its activity when bound to a polymer. This allows catalyst recycling and better control of the reaction medium. Unlike most common processes for cyclic ketone production, the proposed novel method occurs in a single step and does not require any cocatalyst...|$|E
