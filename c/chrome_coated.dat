30|$|The {{revision}} of 4 {{of the total}} nickel sensitive group (n[*]=[*] 19) represents 21 % failure at 2.5  years. This rate is similar to other authors where cementless hybrid stems were used and 17 % failed at 2  years compared to 32 % of the cemented stems (Edwards et al. 2014). Likewise, in a different series of 84 patients fifty-year-old or younger, 27 % failed for any reason at 10  years (Aggarwal et al. 2014). An incidence of 35 % visible stem hypertrophy was noted in the first year. At 3 -year-follow-up, no further revisions were done and half without a cessation of tip-of-stem pain. What is worrisome is the frequency of early stem hypertrophy in the long stem cementless hybrid group of patients in which 20 % were still considered at risk for continued or impending failures from continued increasing modular mismatch and cortical hypertrophy. The design of implant may influence the outcome such as hybrid cementless long stems in women prone to osteopenia and modulous mismatch. While women were more prone to this, it was apparent in {{both male and female}} patients where these stems are used (solid cobalt <b>chrome</b> <b>coated</b> stems).

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to substitute wet chemical mould coatings in the plastic and rubber processing by PVD and CVD coatings. Suitable mould coatings should show good demoulding characteristics, a positive wear-resistance and advantageous corrosion attributes. To judge the demoulding performance, trials with laboratory moulds were made and a demoulding device was built, enabling you to measure demoulding forces directly. PVD and CVD coatings showed reduced (up to 20 - 25 %) demoulding forces compared with uncoated and galvanic <b>chrome</b> <b>coated</b> moulds. The influence of mould release agents are significantly stronger than the influence of different mould coatings. Due to the 2 to 4 times (TiC) higher micro hardness (Vickershardness) of PVD and CVD coatings compared with hardened steal and galvanic chrome, a higher wear-resistance of the moulds had been achieved. This helps against abrasive parts of the rubber formulation and abrasive mould cleaning. A higher corrosion resistance of some CVD and PVD coatings had been proved by extensive laboratory trials and corrosion tests as well as long term production use. CVD coatings and multilayers with CVD basic coatings are clearly more corrosion resistant than galvanic chrome coatings. It was proved during the project that PVD and CVD coatings can substitute the use of wet chemical galvanic chrome mould coating. (orig.)

When <b>chrome</b> was <b>coated</b> on cladding surface, it showed fewer weight gain by high temperature oxidation compared to bare zirconium cladding. Chrome forms chrome oxide or chromia (Cr 2 O 3) when oxidized, and this layer prevents further oxidation thus protecting inner material from oxidizing. However, previous studies indicated that implementation of chrome containing alloys have major drawbacks such as excessive coating thickness or degraded critical heat flux (CHF). Instead, direct coating of chromia was suggested in this study with the expectation of CHF enhancement compared to other chrome alloy coatings. Chromia nanoparticles were coated on nichrome wire surface with boiling deposition of chromia nanofluid.

The result shows that nitriding substrate with hard chrome layers has nitrogen atoms concentration almost twice greater than that without hard chrome layers. After being given a hard chrome plating, nitriding on AISI 4140 steel generally has a nitrogen concentration of up to 4 {{times more than the}} substrate without hard <b>chrome</b> <b>coating.</b> Almost the entire specimen showed the highest concentration of N atoms in the area below the surface (hardening depth of 200 to 450 µm). N atoms diffusion depth profile has a correlation with hardening depth profile, especially on the specimens layered with hard chromium. The substrate without hard chrome plating tends to have higher surface hardness than the sub-surface. The results show that the effectiveness and efficiency of the gas nitriding diffusion process can be produced without the use of gas in the muffle reactor but the specimens must be hard chromium coated first.

50|$|Until {{manufacturers}} developed {{new ways}} to mill the oxide, the crystals could easily be broken in the manufacturing process, and this led to excessive print-through (echo). Output from a tape could drop about 1 dB or so in a year's time. Although the decrease was uniform across the frequency range and noise also dropped the same amount, preserving the dynamic range, the decrease misaligned Dolby noise reduction decoders that were sensitive to level settings. The <b>chrome</b> <b>coating</b> was harder than competitive coatings, and that led to accusations of excessive head wear. Although the tape wore hard ferrite heads faster than oxide based tapes, it actually wore softer permalloy heads at a slower rate; and head wear was more a problem for permalloy heads than for ferrite heads. The head wear scare and licensing issues with DuPont kept blank consumer chrome tapes at a great disadvantage versus the eventually more popular Type II tapes that used cobalt-modified iron oxide, but chrome was the tape of choice for the music industry's cassette releases. Because of its low Curie temperature (approximately 386 K), chrome tape lent itself to high-speed thermomagnetic duplication of audio and video cassettes for pre-recorded product sales to the consumer and industrial markets.|$|R

The sulphur converts to aqueous sulphuric acid, H 2 SO 4, and condenses on the cylinder liner surface, where it causes corrosive attack when not neutralised {{by the high}} alkaline reserve in the lubricant.

Currently neglected by the industry, is the catalysing action of H 2 SO 4 on lubricant degradation and the rheology of entrained droplets in the oil film, which was the motivation for this study. To understand the basic interaction of H 2 SO 4 with the lubricant film, the Saturated hydrocarbon squalane, C 30 H 62, was chosen as a simple model oil in addition to fully formulated lubricants and their corresponding API Group I base oils.

The interaction of stearic acid monolayer with calcium, zinc cations as functions of pH, temperature, concentration of metal cation in the subphase and barrier speed was examined in detail. The effects of transfer surface pressure, the dipping speed, drying period, pH, concentration of metal cations in the subphase and temperature in the deposition of metal stearates onto glass substrates were optimized. Metal stearate LB films were prepared and characterized by X Ray Diffraction technique. It was revealed that the zinc stearate arrangement may be identified as under the orthorhombic (R) subcell with chain tilt angle of 31 o, which was confirmed by IRspectrum of zinc stearate. Atomic Force Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy images showed that surface roughness on glass substrates was decreased by firstly <b>chrome</b> <b>coating</b> and then silver coating.

In this work the dry sliding wear properties of electroplated hard chromium and autocatalytic electroless nickel-phosphorus(10 % P) were compared. All tests and investigations were done by using available equipment at Karlstads University. The tests were made to find out how the wear of these coatings behaved at different temperatures, how different substrates influence the wear of these coatings and how the roughness of the substrate surface influence the wear properties of these coatings. The method used for the wear tests was block-on-ring with a counterformal contact mode. The tests were executed in room temperature, 300 C and 400 C; with a normal load of 100 N, sliding speed was 150 rpm and duration of the tests were 15 minutes. All tests were done in an argon gas atmosphere. The coatings was deposited onto the cylinders with a thickness of 30 µm. The different substrates used were an austenitic stainless steel(1. 4404) and an austenitic-ferritic(duplex) stainless steel(1. 4460). Half of the austenitic cylinders had a machined surface and all the others(including duplex cylinders) were machined and grinded to achieve a smoother surface. The blocks used as countersurface were made out of austenitic-ferritic(duplex) stainless steel(1. 4460).
