40|$|The {{antibacterial}} activity of SY 5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was {{compared with those}} of cefaclor, cefixime, and <b>cefteram.</b> SY 5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY 5555 was less active than cefixime or <b>cefteram.</b> SY 5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY 5555, cefixime, and <b>cefteram</b> were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY 5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY 5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L- 1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS 354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY 5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and <b>cefteram,</b> for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN 7391 and E. cloacae GN 7471 strains. These results suggest that SY 5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics...|$|E

BMY- 28232 has {{a widely}} {{expanded}} spectrum with high activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. BMY- 28232 is far more active than cefixime or <b>cefteram</b> against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of BMY- 28232 was comparable to or somewhat weaker than that of cefixime or <b>cefteram.</b> BMY- 28232 was a poor substrate for various beta-lactamases. Orally administered BMY- 28271 had a good therapeutic effect on systemic infections with S. aureus and some gram-negative bacteria in mice. Oral BMY- 28271 was efficacious against S. aureus Smith infection: the efficacy of BMY- 28271 was 80 to 90 times {{higher than that of}} cefixime or <b>cefteram...</b>|$|E
40|$|Occupational asthma (OA) {{can improve}} after {{cessation}} of exposure; however, some patients suffer from persistence or aggravation of their asthmatic symptoms. Here we report {{a case of}} a new sensitization to house dust mites during the follow-up period in a 37 -year-old female patient with OA induced by <b>cefteram</b> pivoxil powder (<b>cefteram</b> powder). She was previously diagnosed with OA caused by inhalation of <b>cefteram</b> powder. Consequently, she left her job and had been well for 9 subsequent years. She began to experience aggravation of her rhinitis and asthmatic symptoms again several months prior to presentation. Her skin-prick test results had converted to strongly positive responses to two types of house dust mites. The serum levels of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and the total and specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels against the two types of house dust mites were elevated. An inhalation challenge test with Dermatophagoides farinae was performed, and significant bronchoconstriction (21. 1 % reduction in the forced expiratory volume in the first second) with asthma symptoms was observed at 10 minutes. To our knowledge, this is the first case demonstrating a new sensitization to house dust mites in a patient with OA caused by <b>cefteram</b> powder. Regular monitoring, including skin-prick tests and measurement of specific serum IgE/ECP levels, may help to screen potential cases...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of CS- 834, a novel oral carbapenem, {{was assessed by}} using a murine model of pneumonia caused by penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and was {{compared with those of}} oral cephems, i. e., <b>cefteram</b> pivoxil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefdinir, and cefditoren pivoxil. Intranasal inoculation of 106 CFU of penicillin-susceptible or penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae in the exponential growth phase induced pneumonia and bacteremia in ddY mice within 48 h. For the treatment of infections caused by the penicillin-susceptible strain the antibiotics were administered orally at 0. 4, 2, and 10 mg/kg of body weight twice daily for 2 days beginning at 24 h after bacterial inoculation, and for the treatment of infections caused by a penicillin-resistant strain the antibiotics were administered at 2, 10, and 50 mg/kg twice daily for 2 days beginning at 24 h after bacterial inoculation. Among the antibiotics tested, CS- 834 exhibited the most potent efficacy against both types of strains. Against infections caused by penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae, CS- 834 at all doses significantly reduced the numbers of viable cells in both the lungs and blood. Cefpodoxime proxetil at all doses and <b>cefteram</b> pivoxil and cefditoren pivoxil at doses of 2 and 10 mg/kg showed comparable efficacies. Against infections caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, CS- 834 at doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg showed the most potent efficacy among the antibiotics tested, resulting in the maximum decrease in the numbers of viable cells in the lungs. Comparable efficacies were observed with <b>cefteram</b> pivoxil and cefpodoxime proxetil at doses of 50 mg/kg each. The concentration of CS- 834 in the lungs and blood was higher than that of cefdinir and was lower than those of the other antibiotics tested, suggesting that the potent therapeutic {{efficacy of}} CS- 834 reflects its strong activity against S. pneumoniae...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary interpretive zone {{criteria}} {{were calculated for}} cefetamet (Ro 15 - 8074) and <b>cefteram</b> (Ro 19 - 5247) by using 10 - and 30 -micrograms disks and three possible MIC susceptibility breakpoints. Absolute interpretive agreement between MICs and zone size criteria ranged from 91. 8 to 97. 2 %. Very major errors (false susceptibility) were {{less than or equal}} to 1. 2 % for both cephalosporin disk tests. Morganella morganii strains appeared to produce the highest rates of very major interpretive errors with cefetamet disks...|$|E
40|$|ME 1207 is the prodrug of ME 1206. Its {{in vitro}} {{antibacterial}} activity was {{compared with that}} of <b>cefteram,</b> cefpodoxime, cefixime, and cefaclor against various clinical isolates. ME 1206 was more active than the other cephems tested against staphylococci, streptococci, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Flavobacterium meningosepticum and had the most potent activity against Haemophilus influenzae and Neiserria gonorrhoeae. The drug also showed a wide spectrum of activity against other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, except methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Alcaligenes xylosoxydans...|$|E
40|$|CS- 834 {{is a novel}} oral {{carbapenem}} antibiotic. This compound is an ester-type prodrug of {{the active}} metabolite R- 95867. The antibacterial activity of R- 95867 was tested against 1, 323 clinical isolates of 35 species and was {{compared with those of}} oral cephems, i. e., <b>cefteram,</b> cefpodoxime, cefdinir, and cefditoren, and that of a parenteral carbapenem, imipenem. R- 95867 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity covering both gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes. Its activity was superior to those of the other compounds tested against most of the bacterial species tested. R- 95867 showed potent antibacterial activity against clinically significant pathogens: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus including ofloxacin-resistant strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin-resistant strains, Clostridium perfringens, Neisseria spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC at which 90 % of strains are inhibited, < or = 0. 006 to 0. 78 microg/ml). R- 95867 was quite stable to hydrolysis by most of the beta-lactamases tested except the metallo-beta-lactamases from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Bacteroides fragilis. R- 95867 showed potent bactericidal activity against S. aureus and Escherichia coli. Penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of S. aureus and 1 Bs, 2, 3, and 4 of E. coli had high affinities for R- 95867. The in vivo efficacy of CS- 834 was evaluated in murine systemic infections caused by 16 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens. The efficacy of CS- 834 was in many cases superior to those of <b>cefteram</b> pivoxil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefdinir, and cefditoren pivoxil, especially against infections caused by S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Proteus vulgaris. Among the drugs tested, CS- 834 showed the highest efficacy against experimental pneumonia in mice caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary interpretive zone {{diameter}} {{criteria were}} calculated for the 5 -jig cefdinir disk diffusion test by using two potential MIC breakpoints (. 0. 5 and s 1,ug/mi). The absolute agreement between tests ranged from 85. 9 to 92. 4 %, and the false-susceptibility errors were principally contributed by the Enterobacter spp. (2. 2 % error). One proposed criterion was 220 -mm zone diameter ( 2 jig/ml) for resistance to cefdinir. Clinical laboratory users of the disk diffusion method should be cautioned {{about the possibility of}} very major interpretive errors among enterobacter isolates. Cefdinir (formerly FK 482, CI- 983, PD 134393) is an orally administered aminothiazolyl-oximino cephalosporin resem-bling cefixime (1 - 3, 6). In contrast to other investigational or recently released orally active cephems such as cefixime, cefetamet, ceftibuten, and <b>cefteram,</b> cefdinir has significant potency against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (3). Sakamoto et al. (10) have reported cefdinir pharmacokinet-ics in animals that most resemble those observed for cefix-ime (2, 3). However, preliminary human pharmacokineti...|$|E
40|$|ME 1207 is the prodrug of ME 1206. Its {{in vitro}} {{antibacterial}} activity was {{compared with that}} of <b>cefteram,</b> cefpodoxime, cefixime, and cefaclor against various clinical isolates. ME 1206 was more active than the other cephems tested against staphylococci, streptococci, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Flavobac-terium meningosepticum and had the most potent activity against Haemophilus influenzae and Neiserria gonorrhoeae. The drug also showed a wide spectrum of activity against other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, except methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Alcaligenes xylosoxydans. ME 1207 is a new oral cephalosporin prodrug which is de-esterified in the intestine to its active form (ME 1206) (Fig. 1). ME 1206 was previously shown to possess a wide spec-trum of bacterial activity and is undergoing extensive clinical evaluation in Japan (3). However, studies to date have not demonstrated the full range of activity of ME 1206, especially that against the various pathogens which are the targets of chemotherapy in compromised hosts. In this study, we compared the in vitro activities of ME 1206 and those of newly developed oral cephalosporins against a wide range of fresh clinical isolates, including methicillin-resistant Staph-ylococcus aureus and various opportunistic pathogens. All strains tested were isolated from specimens from patients at various hospitals in Japan. The sodium salt of ME 1206 was synthesized at the Pharmaceutical Research Laborato...|$|E
40|$|During {{in vitro}} {{susceptibility}} testing of clinical isolates of Proteus vulgaris, {{we noted that}} the MICs of several expanded-spectrum cephems were much higher in the broth microdilution method than in the agar dilution method (termed the MIC gap phenomenon). Here we investigated the mechanism of the MIC gap phenomenon. Cephems with the MIC gap phenomenon were of the oximino type, such as cefotaxime, <b>cefteram,</b> and cefpodoxime, which serve as good substrates for inducible class A β-lactamase (CumA) enzymes produced by P. vulgaris; this finding suggests {{a relationship between the}} MIC gap phenomenon and CumA. Since peptidoglycan recycling shares a system common to that inducing CumA, we analyzed the mechanism of the MIC gap phenomenon using P. vulgaris B 317 and isogenic mutants with mutations in the peptidoglycan recycling and β-lactamase induction systems. The MIC gap phenomenon was observed in the parent strain B 317 but not in B 317 G (cumG-defective mutant; defective peptidoglycan recycling) and B 317 R (cumR-defective mutant; defective CumA transcriptional regulator). No β-lactamase activity was detected in B 317 G and B 317 R. β-Lactamase activity and the MIC gap phenomenon were restored in B 317 G/pMD 301 (strain transcomplemented by a cloned cumG gene) and B 317 R/pMD 501 (strain transcomplemented by a cloned cumR gene). MICs determined by the agar dilution method increased when lower agar concentrations were used. Our results indicated that the mechanism of the MIC gap phenomenon is related to peptidoglycan recycling and CumA induction systems. However, it remains unclear how β-lactamase induction of P. vulgaris is suppressed on agar plates...|$|E
