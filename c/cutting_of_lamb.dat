The variability is often derived from the characteristics of individual items to be processed e. g. natural product items such as meat portions or fish fillets which vary uniquely on an individual basis. Research into flexible knowledge-biled programming, sensor measurement, and sensor feedback to accommodate task variability is described. Example developed systems include scaled wall framing construction for domestic buildings using expert knowledge on building techniques, palletising of variable-size oil canisters, automated de-boning of fish fillets, and robotic <b>cutting</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> carcasses.

40|$|The {{data set}} for {{estimation}} of genetic and phenotypic parameters of reproductive traits in Kordi sheep {{were collected from}} 1996 to 2013. The reproductive traits included age at first <b>lambing</b> (AFL), number <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> born (NLB/EL) and weaned (NLW/EL) per ewe in each <b>lambing,</b> total weight <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> born (TWLB/EL) and weaned (TWLW/EL) per ewe in each <b>lambing,</b> total number <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> born (TNLB) and weaned (TNLW) per ewe, total weight <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> born (TWLB) and weaned (TWLW) per ewe. The genetic parameters were estimated through restricted maximum likelihood method using WOMBAT. The effects of environmental factors (year <b>of</b> <b>lambing,</b> type <b>of</b> birth, maternal age at lambing) on all reproductive traits were significant (p < 0. 01). Direct heritability, maternal heritability and the ratio of maternal permanent environmental variance to phenotypic variance for reproductive traits were estimated {{in the range from}} 0. 07 to 0. 18, 0. 03 to 0. 08 and 0. 01 to 0. 03, respectively. Genetic and phenotypic correlations between reproductive traits were estimated to be positive and within the range of 0. 09 to 0. 96 and 0. 02 to 0. 29, respectively.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the demand and price characteristics for lamb in the US and Oregon. The primary objective was to estimate coefficients for three variables in a demand function for lamb, and these variables were the production <b>of</b> <b>lamb,</b> the production <b>of</b> substitute meats, and an income factor. Two secondary objectives were to determine the influence of imported mutton on the price <b>of</b> <b>lamb,</b> and to consider the future trend in the price <b>of</b> <b>lamb.</b> The analysis consisted of two parts, the development of a single equation demand function for lamb and the formation of a structural model of the sheep industry. In both cases the price <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> was taken as a dependent variable, and price flexibility coefficients were estimated for the other variables. The flexibility coefficient for the production <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> was estimated to be 0. 88 in the single equation and - 1. 22 in the structural model. The structural flexibility was considered to be the best estimate as the validity of this coefficient did not depend on the assumption that the quantity <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> produced was determined independently of the price. There were indications that the current price <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> did influence the quantity produced. The conclusion reached was that the price was slightly flexible to changes in lamb production. The flexibility coefficient for the production of substitute meats was - 1. 11 in the single equation and - 1. 18 in the structural model. The high flexibility coefficient indicates that the level of production of substitute meats is important in determining the price <b>of</b> <b>lamb.</b> The flexibility coefficient for the income variable was + 0. 20 in the single equation and + 0. 42 in the structural model. Both estimates show a positive inflexible relationship with the price. To evaluate the impact of imports on the price <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> it was found necessary to estimate the annual production of mutton in the US, as no data give this information directly. A variable for the total quantity of mutton was included in the single equation demand function. The price decline associated with the increase of imports was estimated to be small. Although the total quantity of mutton increased by 39 percent between 1958 and 1959, over 93 percent of the decline in price was attributed to other variables. The flexibility coefficient for the production <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> in Oregon was estimated to be - 0. 54. This indicates a greater inflexibility <b>of</b> the <b>lamb</b> price than was found for the US. A higher flexibility of the price was associated with the production <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> in California. This indicated that California provides an important outlet for the marketing <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> from Oregon. The production of substitute meats and the income variable have expanded consistently throughout the period of the analysis. The net effect of these two variables was estimated from the structural model to cause a decrease in the price <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> <b>of</b> 0. 67 /cwt each year. However, the model indicates that producers tend to reduce the size of the breeding flock in response to a decline in price. This reduction and the decrease in the size <b>of</b> the <b>lamb</b> crop that would follow are expected to partially offset the price decline. The conclusion reached is that lamb prices can only be maintained at the present level if the size of the breeding flock decreases...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Market lamb {{production}} usually requires {{a short period}} of time. The success of production is therefore dependent upon the growth rate <b>of</b> the <b>lambs</b> which is influenced by milk yields of the ewes. Different growth potentials of animals result from a difference in their utilisation of food. Since metabolism affects the blood constituents which can be measured, it was the objective of this experiment to study the variations of blood amino acid and urea nitrogen levels <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> and their dams during the suckling period. The relationship between constituents and the relationship of each constituent with weight and age <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> were studied. Also relationships of blood constituents of ewes with blood constituents, weights and ages <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> were studied. Five breeds of sheep were used: Willamette, Suffolk, Columbia, Dorset Horn and Border Cheviot. Weights <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> were recorded {{at the same time as}} blood samples were taken from lambs and their dams. The experiment was conducted for seven two-week periods during the Winter and Spring of 1962. Blood amino acid and urea nitrogen levels were found to be associated with growth <b>of</b> <b>lambs.</b> Blood amino acid nitrogen levels <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> were different due to breeds (P <. 01) but not due to periods, while urea nitrogen levels of the blood were different due to periods and types of birth (P <. 01). Suffolks showed the highest level of blood amino acid nitrogen, a level of 7. 84 mg. whereas Columbias gave a value of 7. 23 mg. per 100 ml. of blood which was the lowest level. Twins had lower levels of blood urea nitrogen than singles and both groups showed a steady decrease in the concentrations of urea as they became older and larger. The correlation coefficient between these constituents was highly significant, whereas no relationship was found within periods between either constituent and weights or ages <b>of</b> <b>lambs.</b> Body weight <b>of</b> the <b>lambs</b> was highly correlated with age. In the case of ewes, blood constituents were associated with milk yields and growth <b>of</b> <b>lambs.</b> Both constituents showed effects of breeds and periods. While blood amino acid levels were not extremely variable, blood urea nitrogen levels markedly increased at the second period then steadily decreased until the end of the experiment. Blood amino acid nitrogen levels of ewes were highly correlated with those <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> (P <. 01), while this relationship was not detected for blood urea nitrogen. A negative correlation coefficient between blood urea nitrogen levels of ewes and body weights <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> was highly significant (P <. 01) in Willamettes, Suffolks, and Columbias, while in Dorset Horns and Border Cheviots it was not significant. However, the average correlation coefficient within breeds and periods was not significant...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} {{undertaken}} {{to study the}} milk yield of Corriedale ewes and the liveweight <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> produced from those ewes with special reference to {{the relation of the}} milk yield to the growth from birth to weaning <b>of</b> suckling <b>lambs.</b> The animals used were 7 Corriedale ewes of 3 years of age and 9 Iambs (singles 5, twins 4) born from those ewes in the spring, 1957 at the Chugoku Stock Breeding Farm of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry. The milk yield of ewes was estimated from the difference of the liveweight <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> weighed before and after suckling and the records of the milk yeild of ewes and of the liveweight <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> were taken at 10 days intervals after birth. The results obtained were as follows : (1) It was found that the milk yield of ewes was highest during the period from 10 to 20 days after lambing and then gradually declined. (2) It seems that the ewes of higher milk yield during the first one month after lambing are greater on the average daily milk production during each 10 days period after lambing and on the total milk production during three months, as compared with those of lower milk yield. (3) Significant correlations were not found between the total milk yield of ewes during three months after lambing and their liveweight on the lambing day and between the former and the liveweight <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> on the day <b>of</b> <b>lambing.</b> (4) Average total milk yield during three months from birth to weaning was 83. 3 kg and the average daily weight gain per single lamb 240 g. (5) There were a few significant correlations between the milk yield of ewes during each one month period and during three months period and the liveweight gains <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> after birth and was generally a increasing tendency of the correlation coefficient values, as lambs grew older. It seems that those tendencies need further investigation. (6) However, a significent correlation (r=+ 0. 91) was found between the total milk yield of ewes and the average daily weight gain <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> during three months period from lambing to weaning.
