[...] The process was originally described in the chronicle of Gustav Vasa written by the clerk and historian Erik Jöransson Tegel in the early 17th century.|$|E
60|$|He {{would like}} to explain the Lupercalia as a popular play, {{representing}} the spirits of vegetation opposing the spirits of infertility. 'But we do not forget that our whole theory {{of the development of}} the rite rests on a hypothesis which the lack of materials prevents us from demonstrating.' He would explain Luperci as Lupiherci--'wolf-goats.' Over this we need not linger; but how does all this prove Mannhardt to have returned to the method of comparing Greek with Vedic divine names, and arriving thence at some <b>celestial</b> <b>phenomenon</b> as the basis of a terrestrial myth? Yet he sometimes does this.|$|E
60|$|While {{he watched}} the far-removed {{landscape}} a tawny stain grew into being on the lower verge: the eclipse had begun. This marked a preconcerted moment: for the remote <b>celestial</b> <b>phenomenon</b> had been pressed into sublunary service as a lover's signal. Yeobright's mind flew back to earth at the sight; he arose, shook himself and listened. Minute after minute passed by, perhaps ten minutes passed, and the shadow on the moon perceptibly widened. He heard a rustling on his left hand, a cloaked figure with an upturned face appeared {{at the base of}} the Barrow, and Clym descended. In a moment the figure was in his arms, and his lips upon hers.|$|E
40|$|A {{close reading}} of the gospel of Matthew {{highlights}} the striking reports of the observation of distinct <b>celestial</b> <b>phenomena</b> in the narrative (e. g. 2. 1 - 12; 3. 16 - 17; 17. 5; 24. 29 - 31). However, the motif of <b>celestial</b> <b>phenomena</b> in Matthew lacks a full or even comprehensive investigation. These have been addressed only in part both in journal articles and in individual chapters of various books. Looking at these <b>celestial</b> <b>phenomena</b> as interrelated parts of the evangelist’s wide theological perspective in the gospel, this study explores Matthew’s description of these occurrences {{in relation to the}} contemporary perspective on <b>celestial</b> <b>phenomena</b> and astrological application. It seeks to assess what meaning and significance the Matthean representation of <b>celestial</b> <b>phenomena</b> was designed to have in the process of the gospel narrative and for the readership. In so doing, this study discusses the conception of heaven and the attitude towards <b>celestial</b> <b>phenomena</b> in the Graeco-Roman world in the Second Temple period, the Sitz im Leben of the Matthean community, and the significance of the heaven motif in the gospel narrative, as preliminaries to the investigation of Matthew’s portrayal of <b>celestial</b> <b>phenomena.</b> This study will show that the motif of <b>celestial</b> <b>phenomena</b> in Matthew carefully crafted and thoughtfully arranged plays a significant role in authenticating the identity of Jesus...|$|R

60|$|I {{then went}} to Idris, contriving in my way, {{plausible}} excuses for remaining all day in the Castle, and endeavouring to disperse the traces of care from my brow. Fortunately she was not alone. I found Merrival, the astronomer, with her. He was far too long sighted in his view of humanity to heed the casualties of the day, and lived {{in the midst of}} contagion unconscious of its existence. This poor man, learned as La Place, guileless and unforeseeing as a child, had often been on the point of starvation, he, his pale wife and numerous offspring, while he neither felt hunger, nor observed distress. His astronomical theories absorbed him; calculations were scrawled with coal on the bare walls of his garret: a hard-earned guinea, or an article of dress, was exchanged for a book without remorse; he neither heard his children cry, nor observed his companion's emaciated form, and the excess of calamity was merely to him as the occurrence of a cloudy night, when he would have given his right hand to observe a <b>celestial</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> His wife was one of those wondrous beings, to be found only among women, with affections not to be diminished by misfortune. Her mind was divided between boundless admiration for her husband, and tender anxiety for her children--she waited on him, worked for them, and never complained, though care rendered her life one long-drawn, melancholy dream.|$|E
60|$|It is {{unnecessary}} {{to continue the}} illustration, for {{it will be very}} evident to every reader, that by going forward in this way, the whole subject may be laid out before the pupils, so that they shall perfectly understand it. They can, by a series of questions like the above, be led to see by their own reasoning, that time, as denoted by the clock, must differ in every two places, not upon the same meridian, and that the difference must be exactly proportional to the difference of longitude. So that a watch, which is right in one place, cannot, strictly speaking, be right in any other place, east or west of the first: and that, if the time of day, at two places, can be compared, either by taking a chronometer from one to another, or by observing some <b>celestial</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> like the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, and ascertaining precisely the time of their occurrence, according to the reckoning at both; the distances east or west, by degrees, may be determined. The reader will observe, too, that the method by which this explanation is made, is strictly in accordance with the principle I am illustrating,--which is by simply dividing the process into short steps. There is no ingenious reasoning {{on the part of the}} teacher, no happy illustrations; no apparatus, no diagrams. It is a pure process of mathematical reasoning, made clear and easy by simple analysis.|$|E

6000|$|About {{the same}} time, Dryden resumed, with new courage, the opera of [...] "Albion and Albanius," [...] {{which had been}} nearly {{finished}} before the death of Charles. This was originally designed as a masque, or emblematical prelude to the play of [...] "King Arthur;" [...] for Dryden, wearied with the inefficient patronage of Charles, from whom he only [...] "received fair words," [...] had renounced in despair the task of an epic poem, and had converted one of his themes, that of the tale of Arthur, into {{the subject of a}} romantic drama. As the epic was to have been adapted to the honour and praise of Charles and his brother, the opera had originally the same political tendency. [...] "Albion and Albanius" [...] was a sort of introductory masque, in which, under a very thin veil of allegory, first, the restoration of the Stuarts to the throne, and, secondly, their recent conquest over their Whig opponents, were successively represented. The death of Charles made little alteration in this piece: it cost but the addition of an apotheosis; and the opera concluded with the succession of James to the throne, from which he had been so nearly excluded. These topics were however temporary; and, probably from the necessity of producing it while the allusions were fresh and obvious, [...] "Albion and Albanius" [...] was detached from [...] "King Arthur," [...] which was not in such a state of forwardness. Great expense was bestowed in bringing forward this piece, and the scenery seems to have been unusually perfect; particularly, the representation of a <b>celestial</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> actually seen by Captain Gunman of the navy, whose evidence is quoted in the printed copies of the play.[1] The music of [...] "Albion and Albanius" [...] was arranged by Grabut, a Frenchman, whose name does not stand high as a composer. Yet Dryden pays him some compliments in the preface of the piece, which were considered as derogatory to Purcel and the English school, and gave great offence to a class of persons at least as irritable as their brethren the poets. This, among other causes, seems to have injured the success of the piece. But its death-blow was the news of the Duke of Monmouth's invasion, which reached London on Saturday, 13th June 1685, while [...] "Albion and Albanius" [...] was performing for the sixth time: the audience broke up in consternation, and the piece was never again repeated.[2] This opera was prejudicial to the company, who were involved by the expense in a considerable debt, and never recovered half the money laid out. Neither was it of service to our poet's reputation, who had, on this occasion, to undergo the gibes of angry musicians, as well as the reproaches of disappointed actors and hostile poets. One {{went so far as to}} suggest, with some humour, that probably the laureate and Grabut had mistaken their trade; the forming writing the music, and the latter the verse.|$|E
60|$|On we flew, {{drawn by}} the mighty current, till at last I noticed that {{the sound of the}} water was not half so {{deafening}} as it had been, and concluded that this must be because there was more room for the echoes to disperse in. I could now hear Alphonse's howls much more distinctly; they were made up of the oddest mixture of invocations to the Supreme Power and the name of his beloved Annette {{that it is possible to}} conceive; and, in short, though their evident earnestness saved them from profanity, were, to say the least, very remarkable. Taking up a paddle I managed to drive it into his ribs, whereon he, thinking that the end had come, howled louder than ever. Then I slowly and cautiously raised myself on my knees and stretched my hand upwards, but could touch no roof. Next I took the paddle and lifted it above my head as high as I could, but with the same result. I also thrust it out laterally to the right and left, but could touch nothing except water. Then I bethought me that there was in the boat, amongst our other remaining possessions, a bull's-eye lantern and a tin of oil. I groped about and found it, and having a match on me carefully lit it, and as soon as the flame had got a hold of the wick I turned it on down the boat. As it happened, the first thing the light lit on was the white and scared face of Alphonse, who, thinking that it was all over at last, and that he was witnessing a preliminary <b>celestial</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> gave a terrific yell and was with difficulty reassured with the paddle. As for the other three, Good was lying on the flat of his back, his eyeglass still fixed in his eye, and gazing blankly into the upper darkness. Sir Henry had his head resting on the thwarts of the canoe, and with his hand was trying to test the speed of the water. But when the beam of light fell upon old Umslopogaas I could really have laughed. I think I have said that we had put a roast quarter of water-buck into the canoe. Well, it so happened that when we all prostrated ourselves to avoid being swept out of the boat and into the water by the rock roof, Umslopogaas's head had come down uncommonly near this roast buck, and so soon as he had recovered a little from the first shock of our position it occurred to him that he was hungry. Thereupon he coolly cut off a chop with Inkosi-kaas, and was now employed in eating it with every appearance of satisfaction. As he afterwards explained, he thought that he was going 'on a long journey', and preferred to start on a full stomach. It reminded me of the people who are going to be hanged, and who are generally reported in the English daily papers to have made 'an excellent breakfast'.|$|E
