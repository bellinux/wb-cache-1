He was a swordsman in his early life and he once helped someone take revenge by killing another person. To avoid being recognised, he <b>covered</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> with white chalk and let his hair run wild. He was later arrested by an official, who asked him for his name, {{but he did not}} reply. The official tied him to a cart, paraded him through the streets, and asked for any person who could identify him. No one came forth. Xu Shu's fellows rescued him later. He was so grateful to be saved that he gave up his life as a swordsman and became a scholar.|$|E

In the same interview, speaking of his father, Jackson said, [...] "There were times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick... I'd start to regurgitate. I'm sorry... Please don't be mad at me...

500|$|Frederick Treves {{first met}} Merrick that November {{at a private}} viewing, before Norman opened the shop for the day.

[...] The viewing lasted no more than 15 minutes after which Treves returned to work. Later that day, he sent Tuckett back to the shop to ask if Merrick might be willing to come to the hospital for an examination. Norman and Merrick agreed. To enable him to travel the short distance without drawing undue attention, Merrick wore a costume consisting of an oversized black cloak and a brown cap with a burlap sack that <b>covered</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> and rode in a cab hired by Treves.|$|E
500|$|For Mortal Kombat X, Ermac was {{designed}} with a slimmer figure and his mask exposing {{more of his}} face, revealing decaying skin. According to NetherRealm Studios, his emaciated appearance {{is the result of}} his losing control of the souls inside his body, with a metal talisman modeled after his chest design from Deception affixed to his chest in order to keep his physical form intact. The talisman initially <b>covered</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> [...] "securely nailed deep into the skull", in concept artwork by character artist Justin Murray. Early designs by Murray had Ermac unmasked with a stockier figure and a solid black palette. Ermac's [...] "Inner Workings" [...] Fatality (a finishing move that executes defeated opponents) in the game has him levitate his opponent, break their spine in midair, and then telekinetically pull their gastrointestinal tract out from their mouth. The finisher was conceived by the game's lead designer, John Edwards: [...] "I remember sitting in the pitch meeting for it. People were like, 'That's hilarious and disgusting.' I'm pretty proud of it." [...] Sound effects used in depicting the graphic violence of his finishers were created with slime and a plunger.|$|E
500|$|In the {{documentary}} Living With Michael Jackson (2003), Michael alleged that {{near the beginning}} of their relationship, the 12-year-old actress tried to seduce the then 17-year-old singer. According to Jackson, the incident happened at her home, where she attempted to unbutton his shirt and talked explicitly about sex. O'Neal's behavior apparently proved too much for Jackson, who became scared and <b>covered</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> before she walked away. When confronted with the allegation, O'Neal claimed to have been [...] "just as shocked as everyone else". She stated that while having respect for Jackson as an artist and a person, he had [...] "a very vivid imagination". The actress described his statements as [...] "inaccurate"; [...] "at 12 years old, {{there was no way she}} was capable of being as mature or as sophisticated as he claimed". O'Neal released her autobiography A Paper Life in 2004, a year after the Jackson documentary. In the book, she claimed it was Jackson who attempted to make out with her. The actress wrote, [...] "I was just 12 and not at all ready for a real-life encounter Michael, who was sweating profusely, seemed as intimidated as I was. He jumped up nervously and said, 'Uh ... gotta go.'" ...|$|E

Real bad". When Jackson received his Living Legend award—presented to him by Janet Jackson—at the 1993 Grammys, he said, [...] "I don't read all the things written about me, I wasn't aware the world thought I was so weird and bizarre. But when you grow up like I did in front of 100million people since the age of five, you're automatically different...My childhood was completely taken away from me.
