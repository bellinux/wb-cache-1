2500|$|It {{could well}} {{be argued that the}} tax {{involved}} here [...] is an [...] "excise tax" [...] based upon the receipt of money by the taxpayer. It certainly is not a tax on property and it certainly is not a capitation tax; therefore, it need not be apportioned.... Congress has the power to impose taxes generally, and if the particular imposition does not run afoul of any constitutional restrictions then the tax is lawful, <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> will.|$|E
2500|$|Cradle of Filth's {{particular}} genre {{has provoked}} {{a great deal}} of discussion, and their status as a black metal band or otherwise has been in debate since near the time that the group rose to fame. The band have openly cited first wave black metal acts such as Bathory, Celtic Frost and Mercyful Fate among their influences, but Dani Filth, in a 1998 interview for BBC Radio 5 for example, said [...] "I use the term 'heavy metal', rather than 'black metal', because I think that's a bit of a fad now. <b>Call</b> <b>it</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> like: death metal, black metal, any kind of metal...". Gavin Baddeley's 2006 Terrorizer interview states that [...] "few folk, the band included, call Cradle black metal these days." [...] In a 2006 interview with Terrorizer magazine, former guitarist Paul Allender said, [...] "We were never a black metal band. The only thing that catered to that was the make-up. Even when The Principle of Evil Made Flesh came out—you look at Emperor and Burzum and all that stuff—we didn't sound anything like that. The way that I see it is that we were, and still are now, an extreme metal band." ...|$|E

We have never exchanged unkind words: there are no concessions to be made: her good sense is not at fault. Besides, these few kind words {{that are supposed to}} be such a sovereign remedy for all sorts of domestic understandings are generally a few kind fibs. If I told them, Marian wouldnt believe them.

The bottom line is that {{no one is going to}} have the courage or the stupidity or the will to talk to reporters from now on. Very few people will, because they can see from this example, what can happen to you... The purpose is, don't even have lunch with reporters. The purpose is, don't have dinner with reporters. Don't pick up the phone if a reporter <b>calls.</b> <b>It</b> doesn't matter <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say, you're not supposed to have a contact with reporters without telling the higher-ups.|$|R

They sprinkle stuff on his toys and on his clothes and on his nurse; what's more, and on any one who comes to see him. And his nursery ain't what I call a nursery at all. It's nothing more or less than a private 'ospital, with its white tiles and its antiseptics and what not, and the temperature just so and no lower nor higher. I don't <b>call</b> <b>it</b> 'aving a proper faith in Providence, pampering and fussing over a child to that extent." ...|$|R

500|$|Tor Cardona of the {{magazine}} Grazia Daily praised the fact the perfume was announced a week after Beyoncé's fifth album, noting she was set for a [...] "world domination" [...] in 2014. Focusing on the scent, Cardona advised female readers to buy it {{and went on to}} state [...] "With hints of orchid, golden apricot and jasmine- we reckon this might just be 2014's hottest scent." [...] BET editor Dorkys Ramos described the scent as a mixture of [...] "sexy, floral" [...] notes. The Daily Telegraphs Katy Young called the gold symphony orchid used in the scent [...] "the queen of orchids". She also said that notes of cashmere musk and vetiver [...] "give the whole blend a grounding element" [...] before concluding [...] "the notes are not wrong". Charlie Gowans Eglinton of Elle, noted that the perfume promised to be [...] "almost as intoxicating as Bey herself" [...] with a [...] "sexy scent" [...] of musk according to reports she had read. In a guide for spring perfumes to buy in 2014, editors of E! Online included Rise, <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> [...] "exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> think <b>it</b> would be: vivacious, strong and bold" [...] and concluding [...] "it is certainly not a dainty spring scent". Cinya Burton of the same publication noted the fragrance was different than other floral perfumes during the season, deeming it [...] "plain fierce".|$|R
5000|$|PopMatters {{also gave}} the album {{a rating of}} 7 out of 10, and commented that [...] "Eat Me, Drink Me should return Manson to his former successes, and {{rightfully}} so. There is an earnestness in the music designed to speak directly to fucked-up adolescence while often inexplicably foregoing the pander. There {{is something to be}} said for knowing where the line is and when to cross <b>it.</b> <b>Call</b> Manson <b>what</b> <b>you</b> will—genius, has-been, shock rocker, freak—but like his best work, Eat Me, Drink Me is as fun as it is cartoonishly scary." [...] Slant Magazine gave the album a favorable review and praised [...] "'Putting Holes in Happiness' as the best of the autobiographical tracks, with a melancholic guitar riff that matches the song's appropriately plodding arrangement. Hardcore fans may take offense to the lack of any songs challenging God, government, or society in general, but it's their loss. Eat Me, Drink Me is a bona fide creative rebirth." [...] Rolling Stone magazine gave the album a three out of five stars and said that Manson [...] "hasn't exactly overhauled his identity, but with Eat Me, Drink Me, he's at least tweaked his approach a bit. ... It's still plenty dark, with Manson dishing about vampires and mutilation in a horror-ific croak that's rougher than ever. ... Some of Eat Me, Drink Me is ho-hum and bone-dry, with few hot choruses and even fewer chord changes. But unlike those breast implants he once had, it's nothing to be embarrassed about." ...|$|R
