5|$|In <b>central</b> <b>California,</b> the {{non-profit}} White Stag Leadership Development Academy sponsors a Learning for Life group, a Venturing crew, and a Boy Scout troop in the Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council and the Alameda Council. These youth plan {{and put on}} a program each summer in <b>Central</b> <b>California.</b> In 2009 they offered for the first time two camps, one at Camp Tamarancho in Marin County in Northern California, and the second at Camp Lindblad in the Santa Cruz Mountains. They have continued to offer two weeks of summer camp and in 2012 based the program at a site in the Santa Lucia Range near Arroyo Seco.

5|$|Both the {{organization}} in <b>Central</b> <b>California</b> and the group in Northern California continue to develop and present summer camps for youth by youth, led by a corps of volunteer adults. The program will observe its 60th anniversary in 2018. Participation in the Monterey-based group has continued to increase each year, to 420 participants in 2015, including 33 youth from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China, up from 70 in 2006. The group sponsored by the White Stag Association has attracted between 40 and 83 campers from 2010 to 2014. The two programs have operated continuously since the program's founding entirely on a voluntary basis, with an estimated 21,000 youth having attended its camps.|$|E
5|$|During {{construction}} of the dam, it was anticipated that the large size and scenic location of the reservoir, coupled with its proximity to urban centers, {{would make it a}} large tourist draw. A $40,000 plan was put forth to develop the reservoir for recreational activities. This entailed the {{construction of}} campsites, picnic areas, boat ramps, a landing strip, and hiking trails, including on 14 of the 33 islands in the lake. Don Pedro has become a popular summer destination in <b>Central</b> <b>California,</b> attracting 360,000–400,000 visitors each year.|$|E
