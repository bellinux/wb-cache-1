40|$|Techniques were {{developed}} for assembling a linear array of optical fibers between two silicon plates and polishing the fiber {{ends in a}} plane perpendicular to the fiber axis. The silicon plates contained etched V-grooves for capturing the fibers. Optical fibers from two sources were evaluated, along with silicon plates supplied by two sources. Most of the arrays were assembled by epoxy bonding, but some {{effort was made to}} form a eutectic bond using gold metallized fibers with gold-coated silicon plates. Measurements were made of the uniformity of spacing of the fiber mode field centers in the linear array.

We are developing a repeatable, accurate, 100 -port micro-fluidic connector to interface to a 100 capillary array. The capillaries are passively aligned for connection {{with a combination of}} precision guide pins and conical tapered holes, and sealed with a PDMS layer after insertion. Using the <b>connector</b> device, an <b>array</b> of 100 loosely-assembled capillaries with 1 mm spacing can be aligned to 20 µm radial accuracy and high repeatability, with only 5 % failure after 10, 000 insertions.

5000|$|Around {{the same}} time the company also {{released}} the D380, which was essentially two M190's in a single larger case. For small inverters like the M190, the case and its assembly represents {{a significant portion of the}} total cost of production, so by placing two in a single box that cost is spread out. The D380 also introduced a new inter-inverter cabling system based on a [...] "drop cable" [...] system. This placed a single connector on a short cable on the inverter, and used a separate cable with either one or three <b>connectors</b> on it. <b>Arrays</b> were constructed by linking together up to three D380s with a single drop cable, and then connecting them to other drop cables using larger twist-fit connectors.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{fabricated}} and packaged a {{very compact}} 4 x 4 wavelength router in Silicon-on-insulator. This device is {{for use in}} a 10 gigabit/s opti-cal backplane interconnect based on tuneable lasers and wavelength rout-ing. Fabrication was done using CMOS compatible processes, enabling vol-ume fabrication. The router consists of a very compact arrayed waveguide grating using submicron waveguides and bend radii of just 3 µm. This is achieved by exploiting the very high refractive index contrast. By applying a double etch scheme, the insertion loss of the arrayed waveguide grating has been reduced to 3. 5 dB for the best routing path. Vertical fibre couplers are used to interface to an standard eight-fibre <b>array</b> <b>connector.</b> The result-ing total fibre-to-fibre insertion loss of the router is 12. 5 dB. The crosstalk level is still- 12 to- 14 dB, which is within spec for the envisaged application. Keywords—Nanophotonics, arrayed waveguide grating I...|$|R
40|$|Presented here is {{the second}} set of testing {{conducted}} by the Technology Validation Laboratory for Photonics at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center on the 12 optical fiber ribbon cable with MTP <b>array</b> <b>connector</b> for space flight environments. In the first set of testing the commercial 62. 5 / 125 cable assembly was characterized using space flight parameters (published in SPIE Vol. 3440). [1] The testing showed that the cable assembly would survive a typical space flight mission {{with the exception of a}} vacuum environment. Two enhancements were conducted to the existing technology to better suit the vacuum environment as well as the existing optoelectronics and increase the reliability of the assembly during vibration. The MTP assembly characterized here has a 100 / 140 optical commercial fiber and non outgassing connector and cable components. The characterization for this enhanced fiber optic cable assembly involved vibration, thermal and radiation testing.

40|$|High {{bandwidth}} parallel optical transceivers {{are highly}} demanded for optical interconnects in data centers and in high performance computing. Such transceivers {{are composed of}} VCSEL- and photodiode components which have to be fiber coupled, and the appropriate driving and amplifying circuitry. For high density fiber optical <b>connectors</b> lens <b>arrays</b> for improved coupling efficiency have to be used. We propose an advantageous adhesive free method to interconnect optical fibers with such kind of lens arrays. Common approaches using adhesive bonding have high challenges in terms of yield, reliability and optical performance. We introduce our novel fiber welding approach for joining directly fused silica fibers on borosilicate glass substrates with integrated micro optics, e. g. lenses and lens arrays. It is a thermal process with a precise heat input by CO 2 -laser processing, which is combinable with sequential passive or active alignment of each single fiber to the substrate c ausing flexibility and highest coupling efficiencies. Since the fiber is accessed only from one side, a two dimensional high-density fiber array can be realized. The manufacturing time of such an interconnection is very short. Due to the adhesive free interface high power transmission is enabled and the occurrence of polymer caused misalignment and degradation are prevented. The paper presents current results in thin glass-based opto-electronic packaging. In particular our laboratory setup for array fiber welding and experimental results of such connections will be discussed and compared to UV-adhesive joining. Also further investigation, for example optical characterization and reliability tests are included. Finally a machine concept, which is under development, will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Parallel optical {{interconnects}} on-board level requires low propagation loss in {{wavelength range}} between 850 and 1550 nm to {{be compatible with}} datacom and telecom optical engines. For highest integration density tight waveguide bends and a scalable number of optical layers should be manufacturable for 2 D interfaces to optical fiber <b>array</b> <b>connectors</b> and photonic assembly I/O's. We developed a glass waveguide panel process for double-sided processing of commercial available display glass by applying a two-step thermal ion-exchange process for low-loss multi-mode graded-index waveguides. Multiple glass waveguide panels can be embedded between electrical layers. The generic concept enables fabrication of high-density integration (HDI) electro-optical circuit boards (EOCB) with high number of optical and electrical layers. Waveguides with high NA of 0. 3 for low bend losses could be achieved in glass with propagation loss of 0. 05 dB/cm for all key wavelengths. Four of those glass waveguide panels were embedded in an EOCB demonstrator with size of 280 x 233 mm(2) providing eight optical layers with 96 channels {{in an area of}} 2. 8 x 1. 5 mm(2).

40|$|V-groove {{structure}} {{is the key}} component for the alignment of fibres in the fibre <b>array</b> <b>connector.</b> This paper presents an investigation on the application of ultra-precision multi-axis machining technology in the fabrication of v-groove component. Ultra-precision raster milling (UPRM) {{is one of the}} multi-axis machining technologies which provide a new solution and more freedom to produce v-groove structure as compared with the precision grinding technology. In this paper, the cutting strategy is developed to schedule the material removal process, select cutting parameters and plan tool paths for v-groove machining in UPRM. Based on the study of the factors affecting machining efficiency, a novel model for machining time prediction is built for the fabrication of v-groove taking into consideration the acceleration and deceleration time of the ultra-precision machine. An integrated system is developed for the machining of v-groove structure in UPRM. Experiment is conducted to produce two different types of v-groove structures in UPRM. The experimental results show that the increase of feed rate decreases the surface quality and the core pitch tolerance of v-groove structure produced by raster milling process reaches to sub-micrometre. The developed model provides a precise machining time prediction for the actual machining process. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} focused on {{broadband}} macromodeling of complex interconnect structures characterized by many ports, like <b>connectors,</b> pack-ages, via <b>arrays.</b> To be characterized, such struc-tures require a large set of data either from mea-surement or full-wave simulations. Therefore, the generation of a macromodel starting from such large dataset is a critical task when a high accuracy over an extended bandwidth is required. Another critical aspect in the macromodeling process is the enforcement of passivity. A non-passive model is hardly usable for practical analyses since it may lead to unstable behavior depending on the termi-nation networks. This paper tries to overcome these difficul-ties by splitting the port responses into sepa-rate small subsets that are macromodeled indepen-dently. Each partial macromodel is constructed from transient responses using a Time-Domain Vector Fitting algorithm. Then, the partial macro-models are assembled into a global macromodel for the entire structure, which is finally tested for passivity. If non-passive, compensation is achieved by spectral perturbation of associated Hamiltonian matrices. Automatic synthesis of SPICE equiva-lents can finally be performed, thus obtaining cir-cuit representations that are ready {{to be used for}} accurate and efficient system-level signal integrity assessments. Some examples illustrate the high de-gree of accuracy of the proposed approach. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{symmetry}} of the phi 29 head-tail connector is controversial: several studies of two-dimensional <b>arrays</b> of the <b>connector</b> {{have found a}} 12 -fold symmetry, while {{a recent study of}} isolated particles has found a 13 -fold symmetry. To investigate whether a polymorphism of the structure might explain these different results, electron microscopy and image analysis were used to study both isolated connectors and particles in hexagonally packed arrays. The hexagonally packed arrays have a P 1 symmetry, and the connectors displayed 13 subunits both in the arrays and as isolated single particles. While we do not observe a polymorphism between <b>connectors</b> in two-dimensional <b>arrays</b> and as isolated particles, data show that the connectors can exist with either 12 or 13 subunits. A three-dimensional reconstruction of our 13 -fold connector was generated by combining an averaged side-view projection with the known symmetry. The structure of rosettes of the connectors formed in the presence of phi 29 prohead RNA (pRNA) was also examined. These rosettes contain five connectors arranged about a single connector in the center, and this arrangement may reflect an essential role of the pRNA in mediating a symmetry mismatch between either a 12 - or 13 -fold symmetric connector and a putative fivefold symmetric prohead portal vertex into which the connector fits...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Visual {{prostheses}} {{have been}} shown to be efficacious in the restoration of basic visual percepts to patients with profound vision loss from retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Previous implants have been located in either the epiretinal, subretinal or intra-scleral spaces of the eye. Bionic Vision Australia has conducted a pilot clinical trial of a novel suprachoroidal implant. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the stability, safety and basic efficacy of the device. Methods: Three subjects with end-stage retinitis pigmentosa (bare light perception) were implanted with a prototype silicone and platinum suprachoroidal array containing 20 stimulating electrodes, which could be directly stimulated via a percutaneous <b>connector.</b> Intraocular <b>array</b> position was monitored over an 18 -month period with weekly fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans. Lead wire and percutaneous connector stability were monitored using monthly X-ray and biannual computerized tomography (CT) imaging. Device efficacy was assessed using psychophysical methods, and assessment of performance in basic visual function tests such as the Basic Assessment of Light and Motion (BaLM), Berkeley Rudimentary Vision Test (BRVT), tumbling E and Landolt C tests. Results: From image analysis, both the intraocular array and extraocular connections remained in a stable position with respect to anatomical landmarks in the retinal plane. There was no damage to the devices, and the only device-related serious adverse events related to superficial skin infection around the percutaneous connector, which settled with topical or systemic antibiotics and no intraocular sequelae. All electrodes remained connected during the 18 -month period. All three subjects perceived phosphene percepts, although there were significant differences in optimal stimulation parameters between them. All patients performed better with the device on than off for the laboratory based visual function tests, including achieving scores of between 72 % and 100 % on the light localisation subtest of the BaLM when the device was on. Conclusions: The suprachoroidal implant location is safe and provides excellent device stability. Visual function test performance was improved with device on vs. device off. As device efficacy and longevity is dependent on a stable electrode-tissue interface, suprachoroidal implantation appears a promising option for visual prostheses...|$|R
40|$|A bus based {{parallel}} architectures is practical {{only for}} {{a small number of}} processors. For several thousand processors the bus would need to have a width of tens of thousands, or possibly a few hundred thousand wires (bits). Similarly, {{it is not possible to}} provide complete interconnectivity for highly parallel systems. For N = 10, 000, 100, 000, 000 channels would be required. Not only is the total number of channels unrealistic, but so is also the number of channels per node. One of the major constraints in system design is the packaging. The number of connections between a chip and a printed circuit (PC) board, or between a PC board and a backplane, or between backplanes, are limited by ensuring a sufficient mechanical strength of the connectors, enforcing a minimum width of each <b>connector.</b> Pin Grid <b>Arrays</b> (PGA) offer 200 – 400 pins per chip package, while current state-of-the art so-called Land Grid Arrays (LGA) offers up to 2, 000 connectors with spacings at about 1 mm, requiring an area of close to 2, 500 mm 2. Board connectors may offer about 2 – 3 pins per mm, or about 1, 000 for a standard PC board. Thus, all highly parallel systems use some form of sparse network to interconnect the processors and memory modules. Locality of reference is important for performance at all levels in most systems.
