25|$|Section 9 of the Employment Ordinance {{makes it}} clear that the fact that an {{employee}} takes part in a strike does not entitle his employer to terminate the employee's <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b> If a worker is dismissed for strike action, he or she would have the right to sue the employer for compensation. However, there is no legal entitlement to reinstatement.|$|E
25|$|Cameron held {{further that}} South African {{employment}} law implied into a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> a general term that the employer would not, without reasonable and proper cause, conduct {{itself in a}} manner calculated and likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of confidence and trust with the employee. Breach of the term would amount to a contractual repudiation justifying the employee in resigning and claiming compensation for dismissal.|$|E
25|$|This {{raises the}} {{question}} why does an employer ever do {{more than it is}} legally obliged to do ? One theory seeking to explain this behaviour is that employment {{is an example of a}} relational contract, based upon a relationship of trust between the parties. The explicit terms of the contract are just an outline as there are implicit terms and understandings which determine the behaviour of the parties. The High Court has long held there is a distinction between the employment relationship and the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b>|$|E

25|$|In the United Kingdom {{information}} about an individual's HIV status is kept confidential within the NHS. This {{is based in}} law, in the NHS Constitution and in key NHS rules and procedures. It is also outlined in every NHS employeeâ€™s <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> and in professional standards set by regulatory bodies. The National AIDS Trust's Confidentiality in the NHS: Your Information, Your Rights outlines these rights. All registered healthcare professionals must abide by these standards {{and if they are}} found to have breached confidentiality, they can face disciplinary action.|$|E
25|$|Underlying Mr Barker's {{claim is}} that the Commonwealth Bank was wrong to dismiss him in breach of its policies. There are {{numerous}} difficulties facing an employee who believes they were wrongfully dismissed. At common law the employee {{had no right to}} be given a reason for the dismissal. If the employer dismissed an employee without notice, a court would scrutinise whether the employee's conduct justified summary dismissal. Even if the contract does not specify a period of notice, a term is implied that either party could bring the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> to an end by giving a reasonable period of notice.|$|E
25|$|The {{court also}} {{considered}} what constitutes constructive dismissal: {{that is to}} say, broadly speaking, resignation due to intolerable conditions at work. It found that, although certain employees are not recognised as such {{for the purposes of}} the LRA, the constitutional right to fair labour practices is nevertheless applicable to them, and that the common-law <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> now includes protection against constructive dismissal. The employee had a contractual right not to be dismissed. It was also held that, for a successful claim based on constructive dismissal, the employer must not only be responsible for the circumstances which induce the employee to resign; it must also be to blame for those circumstances.|$|E

25|$|A fervent {{champion}} of the professional cricketer's rights, Shaw {{did a lot of}} work in support of his contemporaries. He declined to tour with WG Grace in 1873/74 because the professionals in the squad were to be afforded only second-class facilities. In 1881, he led a strike of Notts professionals, demanding a formal <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> to guarantee an automatic benefit {{at the end of an}} agreed playing period. The high-handed Nottinghamshire committee thought this absolute anarchy and, apparently justified in its feeling that an amateur skipper was the way to go, dropped every member of the offending faction from the side. There was eventually a reconciliation, however, and Shaw took on the capaincy once more.|$|E
25|$|The SM-sarja {{was also}} {{outdated}} on its own, {{as it was}} run according to amateur principles. Clubs {{were not supposed to}} pay their players beyond compensation for lost wages. However, by the 1970s many clubs were already run like businesses and recruited players through a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> paying their wages secretly and often evading taxes. However, in 1974, accounting reform in Finland extended book-keeping standards to cover sports clubs, and shortfalls were exposed in audit raids. The SM-liiga was to allow wages for players, and clubs were also put under a tighter supervision. They were to establish their own association for SM-liiga ice hockey only, separating their commitments from junior activities and other sports. Copies of all player contracts were to be sent to the SM-liiga to provide players with adequate security, such as insurance and pensions.|$|E
25|$|A <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> {{can always}} create better terms than {{statutory}} minimum rights. But {{to increase their}} bargaining power to get fair terms, employees organize labor unions for collective bargaining. The Clayton Act of 1914 guarantees all people the right to organize, and the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 creates rights for most employees to organize without detriment through unfair labor practices. Under the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, labor union governance follows democratic principles. If a majority of employees in a workplace support a union, employing entities {{have a duty to}} bargain in good faith. Unions can take collective action to defend their interests, including withdrawing their labor on strike. There are not yet general rights to directly participate in enterprise governance, but many employees and unions have experimented with securing representation on corporate boards.|$|E

25|$|While {{based in}} Cornwall, Murdoch {{had to deal}} {{with a wide range of}} {{mechanical}} problems related to steam engines, and this led him to make practical improvements to the basic steam engine designs used by Boulton and Watt. From 1782 there is evidence that Murdoch was discussing and collaborating with Watt on a number of inventions and improvements. There is, however, a dearth of letters from Murdoch to Watt from 1780 until 1797 in the Watt archive, possibly, as argued by John Griffiths, due to an attempt by Watt's son, James Watt Junior, to uphold his father's reputation by removing any evidence of the origin of some of the inventions he patented. It is almost certain that Murdoch's <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> in common with those for other employees of Boulton and Watt, specified that anything he invented would be the intellectual property of his employers, and frequently it was they who filed, and benefited from, patents on these inventions.|$|E
25|$|Mr Barker was {{employed}} by the Commonwealth Bank from when he left school in 1981. By 2004 he had been promoted to a position as an executive manager. On 2 March 2009, Mr Barker was told that his position was to be made redundant and {{that if he was}} not redeployed within the Bank his employment would be terminated. Mr Barker was placed on paid leave and his access to the Bank's intranet and email facilities was terminated. Having been deprived of access to his Bank email account and voicemail, Mr Barker was not informed about an alternative position within the Bank until 26 March 2009. He was not contacted by the recruitment consultant involved in facilitating the recruitment process for that position, nor was the possibility of retraining for that role discussed with him. The Commonwealth Bank terminated Mr Barker's employment on 9 April 2009 by reason of redundancy. At the time of his dismissal, Mr Barker's salary was approximately $150,000 per annum. Mr Barker claimed that the Bank acted in breach of its own policies and in so doing breached his <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> because (1) the policies were incorporated into his contract or (2) of an implied term of mutual trust and confidence. Mr Barker also claimed the Commonwealth Bank engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct.|$|E
25|$|This {{meant that}} a group of car valeters, {{although}} described in their contracts as being self-employed, with a right to substitute another person to do their work, and professed to have no obligation to undertake work, were entitled to a minimum wage and paid leave. The contract terms could be disregarded because they did not represent the reality of the situation. In addition, a â€˜workerâ€™ is defined in ERA 1996 section 230 as someone with a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> or who personally performs work and is not a client or a customer. This concept has greater scope, and protects more people, than does the term â€˜employeeâ€™. This class of person is entitled to a safe system of work, a minimum wage and limits on working time, as well as discrimination and trade union rights, but not job security, child care and retirement rights. This concept thus reaches up to protect people who are quasi-self-employed professionals, such as partners of a law firm. People will also be workers but not employees when they are not so vulnerable, and relatively independent from their employers, such as home cleaners, music teachers who visit a student home, or independent taxi cab drivers. However, if they are employed through an agency, they will be employees in relation to the agency. Though not entitled to employee rights, these workers may form trade unions and take collective action under UK, EU and international law, to protect their interests.|$|E

2500|$|The {{immediate}} {{impact of the}} decision is that mutual trust and confidence as an implied contractual term is dead and buried in Australia.

2500|$|The {{court found}} {{that the right to}} fair labour practices, in section 23(1) of the Constitution, imports into the common-law <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> the general term that the {{employer}} will not, without reasonable and proper cause, conduct itself in a manner calculated and likely to destroy or seriously damage its relationship of confidence and trust with its employee. The court thus imposed [...] "a new general and contractual obligation on employers"â€”a duty of fair dealing with employees. In this the court had broken with the much-criticsed common-law rule that [...] "an employer is free to terminate the contract at any stage, for any reason or indeed for no reason or the worst possible reason, provided only that the requisite notice is given." [...] The <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> therefore, may now be relied upon where there is an overlap with section 186(2) of the Labour Relations Act (LRA), or where that section does not provide for a remedy.|$|E
