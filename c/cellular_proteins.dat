5|$|Bacterial growth follows four phases. When a {{population}} of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the lag phase, a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is the log phase, {{also known as the}} logarithmic or exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins.</b> The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.|$|E

40|$|Poster SessionPeritoneal {{dialysis}} (PD) is recognised as {{a therapy}} {{for patients with}} end stage renal failure. Continuous prolonged exposure of the peritoneal membrane to unphysiologic PD solutions results in the activation of the mesothelium, with increased synthesis and secretion of pro-inflammatory/fibrotic mediators, and increased deposition of matrix proteins. We have recently shown that emodin, a natural anthraquinone can abrogate elevated glucose-induced matrix synthesis in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMC). This study aims to investigate the modulatory role of emodin on HPMC morphology, matrix synthesis (fibronectin and collagen type I), and TGF-β 1 and IL- 1 β secretion after stimulation with either spent non-infected or infected conventional PD fluids. HPMC were characterized by their cobblestone, polygonal morphology, and positive staining for vimentin and cytokeratin. HPMC cultured with either spent non-infected or infected PD fluids for 48 h resulted in an elongated fibroblastic appearance. These transdifferentiated mesothelial cells were activated as demonstrated by their positive staining for smooth muscle actin. Activation of HPMC was accompanied {{by an increase in}} fibronectin, collagen type I, TGF-β 1 and IL- 1 β secretion (210. 5 ± 12. 5 ng/μg <b>cellular</b> <b>protein,</b> 64. 5 ± 5. 4 ng/μg <b>cellular</b> <b>protein,</b> 3. 9 ± 0. 5 pg/μg <b>cellular</b> <b>protein,</b> and 4. 2 pg/μg <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> respectively for non-infected PD fluid; 390. 5 ± 24. 5 ng/μg <b>cellular</b> <b>protein,</b> 108 ± 12. 9 ng/μg <b>cellular</b> <b>protein,</b> 5. 2 ± 1. 6 pg/μg <b>cellular</b> <b>protein,</b> and 7. 9 ± 2. 7 pg/μg <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> respectively for infected PD fluid (P< 0. 05 for all, infected vs non-infected, n= 5). Co-incubation of HPMC with spent non-infected or infected PD fluids and emodin (20 μg/ml) resulted in a reduction in activated mesothelial cells, with a significant number of cells reverting back to their polygonal, epithelial morphology. Furthermore, emodin significantly reduced matrix protein and cytokine/growth factor secretion to levels similar to basal conditions.

25|$|Targeted therapies are a {{relatively}} new class of cancer drugs that can overcome {{many of the issues}} seen with the use of cytotoxics. They are divided into two groups: small molecule and antibodies. The massive toxicity seen with the use of cytotoxics is {{due to the lack of}} cell specificity of the drugs. They will kill any rapidly dividing cell, tumor or normal. Targeted therapies are designed to affect <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins</b> or processes that are utilised by the cancer cells. This allows a high dose to cancer tissues with {{a relatively}} low dose to other tissues. As different proteins are utilised by different cancer types, the targeted therapy drugs are used on a cancer type specific, or even on a patient specific basis. Although the side effects are often less severe than that seen of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, life-threatening effects can occur. Initially, the targeted therapeutics were supposed to be solely selective for one protein. Now it is clear that there is often a range of protein targets that the drug can bind. An example target for targeted therapy is the protein produced by the Philadelphia chromosome, a genetic lesion found commonly in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. This fusion protein has enzyme activity that can be inhibited by imatinib, a small molecule drug.|$|E
25|$|Their {{life cycle}} {{is thought to}} begin with a virion {{attaching}} to specific cell-surface receptors such as C-type lectins, DC-SIGN, or integrins, which is followed by fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes. The virions taken up by the cell then travel to acidic endosomes and lysosomes where the viral envelope glycoprotein GP is cleaved. This processing appears to allow the virus to bind to <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins</b> enabling it to fuse with internal cellular membranes and release the viral nucleocapsid. The Ebolavirus structural glycoprotein (known as GP1,2) is responsible for the virus' ability to bind to and infect targeted cells. The viral RNA polymerase, encoded by the L gene, partially uncoats the nucleocapsid and transcribes the genes into positive-strand mRNAs, which are then translated into structural and nonstructural proteins. The most abundant protein produced is the nucleoprotein, whose concentration in the host cell determines when L switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication of the viral genome results in full-length, positive-strand antigenomes that are, in turn, transcribed into genome copies of negative-strand virus progeny. Newly synthesized structural proteins and genomes self-assemble and accumulate near the inside of the cell membrane. Virions bud off from the cell, gaining their envelopes from the cellular membrane from which they bud. The mature progeny particles then infect other cells to repeat the cycle. The genetics of the Ebola virus are difficult to study because of EBOV's virulent characteristics.|$|E
40|$|The inhibitions of <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> and RNA {{synthesis}} in picornavirus-infected {{cells are}} early events which require only limited synthesis of virus-specific proteins. The inhibition of <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis {{appears to be}} due to blocking of the association of ribosomes with host messenger RNA. Inhibition of cellular RNA synthesis involves inactivation of the template-enzyme complex and affects ribosomal RNA synthesis before messenger RNA synthesis. Inhibition of cellular DNA synthesis also occurs early and may be secondary to inhibition of <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis. Early chromatid breaks may be related to inhibitions of <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> and nucleic acid synthesis. Stimulation of phospholipid synthesis in picornavirus-infected cells also requires only limited synthesis of virus-specific proteins. In contrast, release of lysosomal enzymes, proliferation of smooth cytoplasmic membranes, cellular vacuolization, retraction, and rounding, and diffuse chromosomal changes related to karyorrhexis and pyknosis are all dependent on considerable synthesis of virus-specific proteins during the middle part of the picornavirus growth cycle.

25|$|Memory {{capabilities}} decline with age, {{evident in}} human degenerative {{diseases such as}} Alzheimer's disease, which is accompanied by an accumulation of oxidative damage. Current studies demonstrate that the accumulation of ROS can decrease an organism's fitness because oxidative damage is a contributor to senescence. In particular, the accumulation of oxidative damage may lead to cognitive dysfunction, as demonstrated in a study in which old rats were given mitochondrial metabolites and then given cognitive tests. Results showed that the rats performed better after receiving the metabolites, suggesting that the metabolites reduced oxidative damage and improved mitochondrial function. Accumulating oxidative damage can then affect the efficiency of mitochondria and further increase the rate of ROS production. The accumulation of oxidative damage {{and its implications for}} aging depends on the particular tissue type where the damage is occurring. Additional experimental results suggest that oxidative damage is responsible for age-related decline in brain functioning. Older gerbils were found to have higher levels of oxidized protein in comparison to younger gerbils. Treatment of old and young mice with a spin trapping compound caused a decrease in the level of oxidized proteins in older gerbils but did not have an effect on younger gerbils. In addition, older gerbils performed cognitive tasks better during treatment but ceased functional capacity when treatment was discontinued, causing oxidized protein levels to increase. This led researchers to conclude that oxidation of <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins</b> is potentially important for brain function.|$|E
