40|$|The {{introduction}} on {{the market}} of computerized Railway Interlocking Systems has pushed an increasing interest {{in the use of}} Formal Methods, due to their ability to precisely specify the logical rules that guarantee the safe establish-ment of routes and equipments for trains through a railway yard. Recently, a trend has emerged about the use of the graphical language statecharts as a standard formalism to produce precise specifications of these systems. This paper resumes our experiences in modeling railway interlocking systems using this formal language. Our stud-ies have addressed the design problem from different points of view: we have modeled the specifications using two dif-ferent approaches that we call functional description and geographical description. The names indicate that the first approach is focused on the modeling of the logical function of the Interlocking Systems, while the latter focuses on the geographical distributions of the element of the <b>controlled</b> <b>station</b> or yard. The geographical approach has also inspired a proposal for a distributed interlocking system, where the logical rules are embedded into distributed equipments communicating by means of safe buses. ...|$|E
40|$|The SCADA {{systems are}} very {{important}} to control widely distributed power networks. Each SCADA system uses a tele-control protocol for communication between stations, one of the commonly used protocols is the IEC 60870 - 5 - 101 standard tele-control protocol. For this study, the IEC 60870 - 5 - 101 was selected to simulate SCADA signals transferring between two stations due to its wide spread use in the tele-control systems, and it is also considered as a base structure for modern tele-control systems such as IEC 60870 - 5 - 104. The aim of this simulation is to study the behavior of the tele-control protocol. Visual basic programming language was used to implement this simulation. The simulation was done by taking a transformer tap changer as an example for the experiment. For this tap changer, Regulating commands from the central station (control centre) were sent to the controlled station(remote station) in order to raise or lower the tap changer position then the step position indications were sent from the <b>controlled</b> <b>station</b> to the central station. Additional SCADA functions, such as generation of alarms and implementation of interlocks, which are not present in the existing SCADA systems, were added within centre station besides its generation in the remote station...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Recently {{developed}} 3 D global seismic velocity {{models have}} demonstrated location improvements through independent regional and teleseismic traveltime calibration. Concurrently, a large set of high-quality ground-truth (GT) events with location accuracies 10 km or better (GT 0 –GT 10) has been collected for Europe, the Mediterranean, North Africa, the Middle East, and western Eurasia. In {{this study we}} demonstrate event location improvements using this new data set by applying the regional and teleseismic model-based travel-time calibrations (independently and jointly). Besides relocating events using all arrivals, {{a subset of the}} GT events was also relocated using <b>controlled</b> <b>station</b> geometries generated from a constrained bootstrapping technique. This approach simulates sparse networks and reduces the effect of correlated errors to ensure valid 90 % error ellipse coverage statistics. With respect to the GT events, we compared event relocations, with and without travel-time calibrations, considering statistics of mislocation, error ellipse area, 90 % coverage, origin time bias, origin time errors, and misfit. Relocations of over 1200 GT events show that Pn and/or P calibration reduced mislocation for 60 %– 70 % of the events. Joint regional Pn and teleseismic P travel-time calibration provided the largest location improvements and achieved approximately GT 5 accuracy levels. Due to correlated errors, event locations using large numbers of stations have deficient 90 % error ellipse coverage. However, the coverages derived from the model errors are appropriate for the simulated sparse regional and teleseismic networks. Our validation effort demonstrates that the global model-based calibrations of Pn and teleseismic P travel times reduce both location bias and uncertainty over wide areas...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on work founded on an {{hypothesis}} that Zimbabwe is endemic for hypothyroidism as previously indicated in human studies, therefore a case for hypothyroidism for livestock was presumed. The studies conducted for this thesis sought to establish population diagnostic systems for thyroid status, hence iodine status, {{that could be used}} in cattle and goats while establishing some reference values and epidemiological factors {{that could be used in}} herd health decision-making. The approaches used for the epidemiological studies included a population cross-sectional study using cattle and goat sera, testing of pasture materials for iodide levels, a station supplementation experimental study and a farmer participatory field trial testing an iodised feed supplement. The diagnostic methods tested included radiommunoassay (RIA) for thyroid hormones, the iodide ion selective electrode (ISE) method for feed materials and the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The RIA was able to detect serum free triiodothyronine and free tetraiodothyronine in cattle and goats. The results are presented confirming the effect of factors such as animal age, body weight, sex, lactation status and natural agro-ecological region in cattle and goats. The range for cattle was 0. 089 to 1. 900 ng/dl with a median of 0. 46 ng/dl; while for goats the range and median were 0. 430 to 1. 49 ng/dl and 0. 933 ng/dl, respectively. An attempt to validate the RIA findings in cattle against levels of thyrotropin did not succeed because the ELISA method attempted suffered from cross-reaction with leutenising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Despite that observations of goitre in goat kids were made in an area previously recorded as highly endemic for human hypothyroidism, a field trial involving iodine supplementation to dairy cattle in the same area could not substantiate hypothyroidism in lactating animals. On the contrary, the iodine containing supplement appeared to depress milk yield. Similarly, a <b>controlled</b> <b>station</b> experiment with weaner calves could not indicate a performance advantage resulting from iodine supplementation. The studies have therefore established the RIA and the ISE as methods which can be used to study the iodine status of cattle and goats and some data to assist further investigations into supplementation regimes aimed at improving productivity in cattle and other livestock...|$|E
