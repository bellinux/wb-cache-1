40|$|Patent {{is one of}} {{the major}} forms of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) used in the {{pharmaceutical}} industry. Trade mark, industrial design, geographical indication and copyright are other forms of IPRs available in India. Grant of patent in India is governed under the Patents Act, 1970. Significant changes like provision of product patents and increase in the term of patent to 20 years were introduced in the Indian patent law, after India signed TRIPS (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement in 1995. This review provides a brief overview of development of patent law in India as a consequence of TRIPS agreement. <b>Criteria</b> <b>of</b> <b>patentability</b> and different types of pharmaceutical patents currently being granted in India are described with the aim to provide the fundamental knowledge of pharmaceutical patenting to the researchers. Other relevant provisions related with patenting of pharmaceuticals like section 3 (d), transfer of the patent rights, compulsory licensing etc. are explained with suitable example...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{transplantation}} of the ‘utility standard’ from the US legal system into the industrial applicability <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> <b>patentability</b> as seen in EPO and UKIPO case law. The Specific, Substantial and Credible standard (SSCS) of utility is growing in prominence as a new gatekeeping criterion in European patent law. This legal transplant lacks explicit statutory basis, is largely driven by a process of mimesis following collaboration between patent offices, and carries the potential to generate collateral damage {{to a number of}} neighbouring legal standards in European patent law. The SSCS potentially undermines the ‘technical’ requirement in Europe and highlights a growing conflation between industrial applicability and disclosure requirements. Additionally the SSCS may increase research tool patentability in Europe, a development that exposes potential inadequacies in the institutional arrangements of the receiving legal system. The legal transplant is aided by institutional dynamics that incrementally entrench a policy choice or legal standard, accompanied by little or no discussion on its viability and legitimacy. The significant normative impact of the process of transplantation of the SSCS places the patent office at the centre of legal and policy change – an entity that is arguably not fit for this purpose...|$|R
40|$|Computer {{programs}} {{can now be}} protected by patents in the EPO, the US, and Japan. Patents can also be obtained for software implemented business methods in the US. This study highlights {{the problems of the}} patent system in protecting computer programs in general, and business methods in particular. One of the main problems is in relation to the economics of software innovation. There have been many disputes on the proper level of protection for software-related inventions to optimize innovation. Another problem relates to the <b>criteria</b> <b>of</b> software <b>patentability.</b> <b>Patentability</b> <b>criteria</b> are different in national patent offices around the world. This can lead to disputes between nations and cause complicated legal problems. Recognizing these issues, this study examines the fundamental {{question of whether or not}} protecting software by existing legal regimes is optimum and desirable in the light of an economic perspective. This discussion reveals a number of disadvantages of the existing legal regimes and leads us to investigate possible altematives to protect computer programs appropriately. Thus, this study examines the basic structures and features of the alternative V systems, which include a 'Market-Oriented Legal Regime, a 'Compensatory Liability Regime', 'Utility Models', 'Direct Protection of Innovation, and 'Self-Help'. Evaluation of the alternative systems through economic perspectives on the basis of the characteristics of modem software development vindicates that the Direct Protection of Innovation proposed by Kingston and Kronz is the most appropriate form of protection for computer programs. To evaluate this more exactly, the development of software is discussed. This study also investigates the main issues that should be considered in introducing the direct protection system to protect software at the international level.

50|$|Four {{questions}} have been referred by the President of the EPO to the Enlarged Board of Appeal. The four {{questions have}} been chosen to look at four different aspects <b>of</b> <b>patentability</b> {{in the field of}} computer programs.|$|R
50|$|The {{substantive}} {{examination of}} European patent applications includes the examination <b>of</b> <b>patentability</b> <b>of</b> the claimed invention, i.e. whether the invention is not excluded as unpatentable subject-matter by policy, whether the invention is new, involves an inventive step, and is susceptible of industrial application.

50|$|Public {{disclosure}} is any non-confidential communication {{which an}} inventor or invention owner makes available {{to one or}} more members of the public, revealing the existence of the invention and enabling an appropriately experienced individual ("person having ordinary skill in the art") to reproduce the invention.

In other countries, public disclosure may result in the immediate loss <b>of</b> invention <b>patentability</b> unless a patent application has already been filed, and disclosure may be considered to include oral as well as written communication.|$|R
40|$|Dariusz Kasprzycki - doktor, Katedra Prawa Własności Intelektualnej Wydziału Prawa i Administracji Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego. In {{this article}} the <b>patentability</b> <b>of</b> biotechnological {{invention}} is discussed focusing on some controversies still arising in that area. Beginning {{from a few}} landmark decisions permitting broad patenting of biotechnological inventions both in Europe and USA (albeit not issued concurrently) the answer for the <b>patentability</b> <b>of</b> living organisms has been made obvious. The assessment should no longer rely on the distinction that {{the subject matter of}} the invention is alive. The above has confirmed the biotechnology directive enacted in 1998. The directive should not be perceived as the sufficient tool for regulation <b>of</b> <b>patentability</b> <b>of</b> biotechnological invention. In the last ten years patent offices across the world are facing several important questions regarding more specific interpretation of the requirements <b>of</b> <b>patentability</b> in that context. The article shows how the concept of novelty, inventive step (non-obviousness) and industrial capability is understood in the field of biotechnology, with particular focus on gene patents. Also the line between invention and discovery is commented. As a separate issue, the exclusion from patentability due to contradiction with morality principles is briefly introduced.

5000|$|All aspects <b>of</b> <b>patentability</b> are checked: Is this an “invention”? Is it new, unobvious, useful? Does the {{application}} fully disclose the invention?

5000|$|Part II sums up {{by stating}} [...] "it is my view that, in reemphasizing that the 'machine-or-transformation' test is not {{necessarily}} the sole test <b>of</b> <b>patentability,</b> the Court intends neither to de-emphasize the test’s usefulness nor to suggest that many patentable processes lie beyond its reach." ...|$|R
50|$|The Court {{added that}} patents are {{intended}} {{to add to the}} sum of useful knowledge, and they cannot be sustained when their effect is to subtract from resources freely available. The Court also emphasized that commercial success without invention is not sufficient for purposes <b>of</b> <b>patentability.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (BPAI) was an {{administrative}} law {{body of the}} United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) which decided issues <b>of</b> <b>patentability.</b> Under the America Invents Act, the BPAI was replaced with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), effective September 16, 2012.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{during that}} time the Courts {{struggled}} to find both the required levels of inventiveness and obviousness and practically useful criteria to measure these levels.

40|$|This Article {{argues that}} courts {{have created a}} de facto extra-statutory {{condition}} <b>of</b> <b>patentability,</b> herein termed the “completeness” requirement. This requirement bars patents on certain inventions whose chief value lies in their function as inputs into downstream research. The Article contends {{that the notion of}} completeness explains doctrinal innovations that are difficult to rationalize any other way. Although it reflects an important policy of limiting unduly preemptive patent claims on foundational, building-block inventions, the completeness requirement in its current form fails to implement this policy {{in a way that is}} coherent and consistent with patent law’s utilitarian goals. In addition, courts’ attempts to develop the completeness requirement based on existing statutory provisions have resulted in controversial interpretations of the Patent Act, generating legitimacy costs. The Article argues that these problems are best addressed by explicitly recognizing completeness as a separate requirement <b>of</b> <b>patentability</b> and modifying the doctrinal tools used to enforce this requirement. To determine whether a patent claim passes completeness, the Article proposes a new test that focuses on the generality and unpredictability of a claimed invention’s applications. Further, it argues that an amendment to the Patent Act codifying the requirement of completeness is the most effective way to implement the proposal. Finally, the Article explores the possibility of awarding a limited patent right, which it terms “Research Patent,” to claims that satisfy existing requirements <b>of</b> <b>patentability,</b> but fail completeness. This right would provide the intellectual property incentives that are likely needed to develop and commercialize foundational inventions, and also help decrease the potential for stifling downstream innovation created by granting full patent protection to such inventions...|$|R
