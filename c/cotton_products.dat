25|$|Besses o' th' Barn Band, and {{subsequently}} its associated boys' band, has {{existed in the}} area since at least 1818, at which time it had converted from a string band to a reed band. Its founders were John, James and Joseph Clegg – three brothers who were manufacturers of <b>cotton</b> <b>products</b> at Besses o' th' Barn – {{and for this reason}} it was for a time known as Clegg's Reed Band. Originally using a room called the mangle room, attached to the old barn at Besses which was pulled down in the 1880s, it has had its headquarters on Moss Lane since 1884. At the peak of its fame in the early 1900s this band, by now using brass instruments, undertook numerous prestigious engagements, including world tours lasting well in excess of 12 months at a time.|$|E

The Alang ship breaking yard is the biggest in the world, recycling about 50% of the salvaged ships of the world. This has also helped develop supporting industries, such as oxygen bottling plants, re-rolling mills, and induction furnaces. Bhavnagar manufactures fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP) boats and steel vessels at the shipbuilding facility of Alcock Ashdown (Gujarat) Ltd. The prominent industries located in Bhavnagar are Alcock Ashdown (Government of Gujarat undertaking), Tamboli Castings Limited, Excel, SteelCast Bhavnagar, Investment & Precision Castings, Elite Chemicals and Sound Build Care Pvt Ltd. Ruvapari Road and Nari Road are areas where most industries are clustered. Bhavnagar has about 150 units manufacturing plastic monofilaments, and more than 400 units manufacturing plastic cloth, twine, ropes, films, and multifilament yarn. Some sections of the society depend on agriculture for their livelihood. The city is a prominent trading post for <b>cotton</b> <b>products.</b> There are 112 medium and large scale industries located in Bhavnagar district.|$|E
25|$|In February 1832 Henry Clay, {{back in the}} Senate after a {{two decades}} absence, made a three-day-long speech calling for a new tariff {{schedule}} and an expansion of his American System. In an effort {{to reach out to}} John Calhoun and other southerners, Clay’s proposal provided for a ten million dollar revenue reduction based on the amount of budget surplus he anticipated for the coming year. Significant protection was still part of the plan as the reduction primarily came on those imports not in competition with domestic producers. Jackson proposed an alternative that reduced overall tariffs to 28%. John Quincy Adams, now in the House of Representatives, used his Committee of Manufacturers to produce a compromise bill that, in its final form, reduced revenues by five million dollars, lowered duties on non-competitive products, and retained high tariffs on woolens, iron, and <b>cotton</b> <b>products.</b> In the course of the political maneuvering, George McDuffie’s Ways and Means Committee, the normal originator of such bills, prepared a bill with drastic reduction across the board. McDuffie’s bill went nowhere. Jackson signed the Tariff of 1832 on July 14, 1832, a few days after he vetoed the Bank of the United States re-charter bill. Congress adjourned after it failed to override Jackson’s veto.|$|E

2500|$|The {{etymology}} of {{the modern}} word [...] "lint" [...] is related to [...] "linting", the term used for the cultivation of the shorter fibers from the cotton plant (Gossypium), also called [...] "lint", from which lower-quality <b>cotton</b> <b>products</b> are manufactured. Lint is composed of threads of all colors, which blend hues and {{may appear to be}} a uniform grey.|$|E
2500|$|South Carolinian George McDuffie popularized the [...] "Forty Bale theory" [...] {{to explain}} South Carolina's {{economic}} woes. He said that tariffs that became progressively higher in 1816, 1824 and 1828 {{had the same}} effect as if a thief stole forty bales out of a hundred from every barn. The tariffs applied to imports of goods such as iron, wool and finished <b>cotton</b> <b>products.</b> The Forty Bale theory was based on faulty math, as Britain could sell finished cotton goods made from Southern raw cotton around the world, {{not just to the}} United States. Still, the theory was a popular explanation for economic problems that were caused in large part by overproduction of cotton in the Deep South competing with South Carolina's declining crops because of its depleted soil. South Carolinians, rightly or wrongly, blamed the tariff for the fact that cotton prices fell from 18 cents a pound to 9 cents a pound during the 1820s.|$|E
2500|$|However, only {{a limited}} number of people can bring claims for {{judicial}} review. Under TFEU article 263(2), a member state, the Parliament, Council or Commission have automatic rights to seek judicial review. But under article 263(4) a [...] "natural or legal person" [...] must have a [...] "direct and individual concern" [...] about the regulatory act. [...] "Direct" [...] concern means that someone is affected by an EU act without [...] "the interposition of an autonomous will between the decision and its effect", for instance by a national government body. In Piraiki-Patraiki v Commission, a group of Greek textile businesses, who exported <b>cotton</b> <b>products</b> to France, challenged a Commission decision allow France to limit exports. The Commission argued that the exporters were not directly concerned, because France might decide not to limit exports, but the Court of Justice held this possibility was [...] "entirely theoretical". A challenge could be brought. By contrast in Municipality of Differdange v Commission a municipality wanted to challenge the Commissions decision to aid steel firms which reduced production: this would probably reduce its tax collections. But the Court of Justice held that because Luxembourg had discretion, and its decision to reduce capacity was not inevitable, the municipality had no [...] "direct" [...] concern (its complaint was with the Luxembourg government instead). [...] "Individual" [...] concern requires that someone is affected specifically, not as a member of a group. In Plaumann & Co v Commission the Court of Justice held that a clementine importer was not individually concerned when the Commission refused permission to Germany to stop import custom duties. This kept it more expensive for Mr Plaumann to import clementines, but it was equally expensive for everyone else. This decision heavily restricted the number of people who could claim for judicial review. In Unión de Pequeños Agricultores, Advocate General Jacobs propose a broader test of allowing anyone to claim if there was a [...] "substantial adverse effect" [...] on the claimant's interests. Here, a group of Spanish olive oil producers challenged Council Regulation No 1638/98, which withdrew subsidies. Because Regulations are not implemented in national law, but have direct effect, they argued the requirement for individual concern would deny them effective judicial protection. The Court of Justice held that direct actions were still not allowed: if this was unsatisfactory the member states would have to change the treaties. Individual concern is not needed, however under article 263(4), if an act is not legislation, but just a [...] "regulatory act". In Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami v Parliament and Council the Court of Justice affirmed that a Regulation does not count as a [...] "regulatory act" [...] within the Treaty's meaning: it is only meant for acts of lesser importance. Here, a Canadian group representing the Inuit people wished to challenge a Regulation on seal products, but were not allowed. They would have to show both direct and individual concern as normal. Thus, without a treaty change, EU administrative law remains one of the most restrictive in Europe.|$|E
