40|$|AbstractA new FE {{model of}} {{unloading}} cooling springback in the NC heating bending of large diameter thin-walled commercial pure titanium tube {{was developed by}} combination of stress-strain field and temperature field. With the commercial pure titanium tube of Ф 50. 8 ×t 0. 508 ×R 101. 6 mm as a representative component, the springback behaviours under different processing conditions were investigated. The results show that: 1) The springback angle increases slowly along with temperature increasing. With the temperature at 180 - 250 °C, the springback angle is least. 2) The heating temperature has certain influence on the <b>cross</b> section <b>distortion.</b> With temperature at 180 - 300 °C, forming quality is better. 3) The mandrel diameter has important influence on the <b>cross</b> section <b>distortion.</b> With the increasing of the mandrel's diameter, <b>cross</b> section <b>distortion</b> rate and outside deformation is more uniform...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} cutting a {{roll-formed}} steel section to specified length {{may lead to}} <b>cross</b> section <b>distortion</b> and may cause initial geometric imperfection. Two roll-formed steel lipped C-sections of grade G 450 were cut to stub columns using an electric saw. <b>Cross</b> section <b>distortions</b> of cut segments and stub columns were measured using a vernier caliper. Initial geometric imperfections of the cut stub columns along the longitudinal direction were estimated using a laser transducer. When a roll-formed steel lipped C-section is cut into two segments, there will be <b>cross</b> section <b>distortions</b> {{in the vicinity of}} the cut. For a cut stub column, variation of imperfection along the longitudinal direction at the flanges can be represented by a half-sine wave.

40|$|The {{conventional}} design of steel beams considers that any deformation {{of a member}} due to applied load must {{be a combination of}} the four rigid body modes (axial deformation, major axis bending, minor axis bending and twisting) i. e. the member retains its cross sectional shape without distortion. In a hot rolled member the warping stresses which arise due to violation of the assumption that plane sections remain plane can often be neglected. In thin walled sections, however, these warping stresses are typically of the same order of magnitude as the primary bending stresses induced in the member by the applied loading and therefore cannot be neglected. In addition, if plane sections do not remain plane, the cross section distorts when a load is applied. The first part of this Thesis presents a method of analysis for any open unbranched thin walled section which considers both rigid body movement and <b>cross</b> section <b>distortion</b> (including local buckling). The method is such that the four rigid body modes are automatically identified and separated from the remaining <b>cross</b> section <b>distortion</b> modes. The second part of this Thesis develops a finite difference method of analysis, in conjunction with the theory of part I, to consider the behaviour of a member subject to any arbitrary loading condition and end restraint. Both first order linear problems and second order elastic critical buckling problems are solved, including the interaction of local buckling, overall buckling and <b>cross</b> section <b>distortion...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{stability}} analysis of thin-walled beams considering <b>cross</b> sectional <b>distortion</b> applying both beam and shell elements. The objective {{is the development of}} a finite element model for thin-walled beams coupling beam and shell elements. For global buckling of thin-walled beams the beam element is used, and the shell element is employed in areas of local stability failure. For an efficient use of the shell model a mesh generator DBGEN is written specifically for thin-walled beams. With respect to the local character of the <b>cross</b> sectional <b>distortion</b> the coupled beam and shell elements are applied. The multipoint constraints are derived satisfying the geometric compatibility within the cross-section. The system equation with multipoint constraints is solved using a straightforward elimination. As expected for the analysis of the interaction of local and global buckling the coupling method turns out to be much more efficient. The automatical output of the multipoint constraints by DBGEN allows to conveniently analyse the coupled model for complex frames with deformable joint areas. (orig.)

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} tube bending, {{preforming}} and subsequent hydroforming on formability of {{austenitic stainless steel}} in manufacture of engine cradle were studied in present study. Wall thickness distribution, surface quality and <b>cross</b> section <b>distortion</b> after tube bending were analysed. The results showed it can obtain high forming quality and dimensional accuracy when tubes are filled with 0. 7 mm diameter steel balls during bending process. It is more important that pulsating hydroforming can effectively improve the formability of final products which have apparent non-uniform deformation due to the springback after bending. Applying pulsating load with large amplitude can achieve a more uniform deformation with a more homogeneous thickness distribution beneficial for preventing excessive local thinning and an excellent die filling performance for tube hydroforming...|$|R
40|$|Tube bending is {{a widely}} used {{manufacturing}} process in the aerospace, automotive, and other industries. During tube bending, considerable in-plane distortion and thickness variation occurs. The thickness increases at the intrados (surface of tube {{in contact with the}} die) and it reduces at the extrados (outer surface of the tube). In some cases, when the bend die radius is small, wrinkling occurs at the intrados. In industry a mandrel is used to eliminate wrinkling and reduce distortion. However, {{in the case of a}} close bend die radius, use of a mandrel should be avoided as bending with the mandrel increases the thinning of the wall at the extrados, which is undesirable in the manufacturing operation. The present research focuses on additional loadings such as axial force and internal pressure which can be used to achieve better shape control and thickness distribution of the tube. Based on plasticity theories, an analytical model is developed to predict <b>cross</b> section <b>distortion</b> and thickness change of tubes under various loading conditions. Results from both the FEA and analytical model indicated that at the intrados the increase in thickness for bending with internal pressure and bending with combined axial pull and internal pressure was nearly the same. But in the case of bending with the combination of axial pull and internal pressure there was a significant reduction of thickness at the extrados. A parametric study was conducted for the case of bending with combined internal pressure and axial pull and it was seen that with proper selection of the pressure and axial pull wrinkling can be eliminated, thickness distribution around the tube can be optimized, and <b>cross</b> section <b>distortion</b> of the tube can be reduced. Predictions of the analytical model are in good agreement with finite element simulations and published experimental results. The model can be used to evaluate tooling and process design in tube bending...|$|R

Secondly, virtual orthogonal arrays are designed to optimize friction coefficients, with minimizing the maximum wall-thinning ratio, the maximum <b>cross</b> section <b>distortion</b> ratio and the maximum height of wrinkling waves as the multi-objectives. Lastly, the mandrel radius is optimized by sequential quadratic programming with approximate regressive models fit from uniform design values in the allowed range.

The springback, <b>cross</b> section <b>distortion</b> and wrinkling defects caused by bending will affect subsequent hydro-forming process.

The cross section un-roundness was decreased from 7. 55 % to 1. 43 % by the improvement of the core shaft, and the fracture of bend tube during hydroforming can be significantly avoided. The wrinkle defects formed in tube bending cannot be eliminated by hydroforming. The 6063 aluminum components with various sections were developed by the technology experiment, and the parts without any defects were obtained.

40|$|Abstract. During the multi-site MUSICOS 92 campaign, the pre-main {{sequence}} Herbig Ae star AB Aur was monitored {{primarily in}} the He I 5876 ˚A line, {{but two of the}} telescopes were equipped with cross-dispersed echelle spectrographs. The wide spectral domain covered by these instruments allows us to study simultaneously the variability of many photospheric lines.

We find that the photospheric lines of AB Aur have variable profiles, and that <b>distortions</b> <b>cross</b> the line profiles from blue to red, on a time scale of a few hours. These distortions tend to extend significantly blueward of the projected rotation velocity boundary of the line. This implies that localized outflows with velocities of the order of 100 kms − 1 must be present in the photosphere and affect photospheric line formation.

40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} {{construction}} of genetic linkage maps of two Eucalyptus globulus parental trees (chapter 2), the detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) carried out using these linkage maps (chapter 3) and a genetic analysis of rooting ability of micropropagated cuttings from two E. globulus families (chapter 4). Genetic linkage maps of two parent trees were constructed using 326 RAPD and 21 microsatellite markers. At a LOD score threshold of 4. 9 for grouping and 3. 0 for marker ordering, the male parent had 13 linkage groups consisting of 101 framework markers and the female parent had 11 linkage groups with 97 framework markers. Even though both parents originated from the same provenance {{it was found that}} polymorphic RAPD markers were readily detectable. Linkages between microsatellites previously reported for E. grandis/E. urophylla were conserved in the E. globulus <b>cross.</b> Segregation <b>distortion</b> of markers was found to be more prevalent than expected by chance. The linkage maps were used to detect QTLs based on 155 progeny grown in field trials. Twelve traits were included in the QTL analysis. These included: wood density (Pilodyn penetration), extent of early flowering (bud abundance), and growth (height at years one and two, stem diameter at years two, three, four and six, and relative incremental growth between years one and two, two and four, and four and six). Using interval mapping a total of eight QTL with LOD score peaks over 2. 0 were detected, corresponding to seven map intervals. QTL detected included: two for cumulative growth; two for wood density; one for early flowering and three for relative incremental growth. Since the 155 progeny trees were grown at seven trial sites, an analysis of marker by site interaction was carried out with more marker by site interactions being found than expected by chance. Markers with significant QTL effects were examined for interaction with site with both of the cumulative growth QTL found to have significant site interaction. QTL stability with age was also analysed for these QTL, and both growth QTL were found to have a detectable association with the first measurements of height and diameter. A study of the rooting ability of cuttings grown in tissue culture from two families of E. globulus was undertaken with the aim of detecting QTLs for this trait. The two families were found to have significantly different rooting abilities indicating that genetic variation for the trait was present. Estimates of variance components relating to genetic and environmental effects indicated that within both families the variance due to genetic effects was small compared to the environmental variance with clonal repeatabilities of 0. 17 and 0. 14 for the two families. These estimates were used in power calculations based on t-tests of single markers under some simple assumptions. However even under optimistic circumstances the power for QTL detection was found to be too low to warrant the time and expense of genotyping required for QTL analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{considerable}} {{progress in}} {{the research and development}} of thin-walled beam structures responds to their growing use in engineering construction and to their increased need for efficiency in strength and cost. The result is a structure that exhibits large shear strains and important non uniform warping under different loadings, such as non uniform torsion, shear bending and distortion. A unified approach is formulated in this thesis for 3 D thin walled beam structures with arbitrary profile geometries, loading cases and boundary conditions. A single warping function, defined by a linear combination of longitudinal displacements at cross sectional nodes (derived from Prokic work), is enhanced and adapted in order to qualitatively and quantitatively reflect and capture the nature of a widest possible range of behaviors. Constraints are prescribed at the kinematics level in order to enable the study of arbitrary cross sections for general loading. This approach, differing from most published theories, has the advantage of enabling the study of arbitrary cross sections (closed/opened or mixed) without any restrictions or distinctions related to the geometry of the profile. It generates automatic data and characteristic computations from a kinematical discretization prescribed by the profile geometry. The amount of shear bending, torsional and distortional warping and the magnitude of the shear correction factor is computed for arbitrary profile geometries with this single formulation. The proposed formulation is compared to existing theories with respect to the main assumptions and restrictions. The variation of the location of the torsional center, distortional centers and distortional rotational ratio of a profile is discussed in terms of their dependency on the loading cases and on the boundary conditions. A 3 D beam finite element model is developed and validated with several numerical applications. The displacements, rotations, amount of warping, normal and shear stresses are compared with reference solutions for general loading cases involving stretching, bending, torsion and/or distortion. Some examples concern the case of beam assemblies with different shaped profiles where the connection type determines the nature of the warping transmission. Other analyses –for which the straightness assumption of Timoshenko theory is relaxed– investigate shear deformation effects on the deflection of short and thin beams by varying the aspect ratio of the beam. Further applications identify the <b>cross</b> sectional <b>distortion</b> and highlight the importance of the distortion on the stresses when compared to bending and torsion even in simple loading cases. Finally, a non linear finite element based on the updated lagrangian formulation is developed by including torsional warping degrees of freedom. An incremental iterative method using the arc length and the Newton-Raphson methods is used to solve the non linear problem. Examples are given to study the flexural, torsional, flexural torsional and lateral torsional buckling problems for which a coupling between the variables describing the flexural and the torsional degrees of freedom occurs. The finite element results are compared to analytical solutions based on different warping functions and commonly used in linear stability for elastic structures having insufficient lateral or torsional stiffnesses that cause an out of plane buckling.
