2500|$|This method can be {{used when}} the truss element forces {{of only a few}} members are to be found. This method is used by {{introducing}} a single straight line cutting through the member whose force wants to be calculated. However this method has a limit in that the <b>cutting</b> <b>line</b> can pass through a maximum of only 3 members of the truss structure. This restriction is because this method uses the force balances in the x and y direction and the moment balance, which gives us a maximum of 3 equations to find a maximum of 3 unknown truss element forces through which this cut is made. Let us try to find the forces FAB, FBD and FCD in the above example ...|$|E
60|$|On the 1st of January, 1838, I was {{the master}} of a lovely shop in the {{neighborhood}} of Oxford Market; of a wife, Mrs. Cox; of a business, both in the shaving and <b>cutting</b> <b>line,</b> established three-and-thirty years; of a girl and boy respectively of the ages of eighteen and thirteen; of a three-windowed front, both to my first and second pair; of a young foreman, my present partner, Mr. Orlando Crump; and of that celebrated mixture for the human hair, invented by my late uncle, and called Cox's Bohemian Balsam of Tokay, sold in pots at two-and-three and three-and-nine. The balsam, the lodgings, and the old-established cutting and shaving business brought me in a pretty genteel income. I had my girl, Jemimarann, at Hackney, to school; my dear boy, Tuggeridge, plaited her hair beautifully; my wife at the counter (behind the tray of patent soaps, &c.) cut as handsome a figure as possible; and it was my hope that Orlando and my girl, who were mighty soft upon one another, would one day be joined together in Hyming, and, conjointly with my son Tug, carry on the business of hairdressers when their father was either dead or a gentleman: for a gentleman me and Mrs. C. determined I should be.|$|E

40|$|The method {{comprises}} producing multiple first cuts {{simultaneously in}} a workpiece along first <b>cutting</b> <b>lines</b> using multiple first separating tools, and producing multiple second cuts simultaneously along second <b>cutting</b> <b>lines</b> using multiple second separating tools. The {{first and second}} cut lines define a plane on which the <b>cutting</b> <b>lines</b> intersect or meet one another. The step of producing the first cuts is performed simultaneously with {{the production of the}} second cuts. The method comprises producing multiple first cuts simultaneously in a workpiece along first <b>cutting</b> <b>lines</b> using multiple first separating tools, and producing multiple second cuts simultaneously along second <b>cutting</b> <b>lines</b> using multiple second separating tools. The first and second cut lines define a plane on which the <b>cutting</b> <b>lines</b> intersect or meet one another. The step of producing the first cuts is performed simultaneously with the production of the second cuts. The steps of the producing the cuts along the first and second <b>cutting</b> <b>lines</b> are matched to one another such that each cut is separated by the first and second cut lines. The first and second cutting tools are arranged along a first axis and a second axis respectively, where the two axes are aligned parallel to each other during the production of the cuts and are formed by support elements. The support elements are moved relative to the production of the cuts to one another along the first and second axes to guide the separating tools along the cut lines. The first and/or second separating tools are energetic beams, which are directed on the workpiece via the support elements or a beam deflector. The support elements are partially guided to optical scanning devices along the cut lines. The first and second cutting tools are introduced in a cutting direction. An independent claim is included for a device for separating a workpiece into multiple segments...|$|R

Some of these votes, like the House’s vote on President Clinton's welfare reform package (the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996) are best modeled through the use of the first (economic liberal-conservative) dimension. On the welfare reform vote, nearly all Republicans joined the moderate-conservative bloc of House Democrats in voting for the bill, while opposition was virtually confined to the most liberal Democrats in the House.

50|$|In India, Pakistan, Brazil and Chile, {{there have}} been {{reported}} accidents involving the abrasive coated <b>cutting</b> <b>line.</b> These accidents range in severity from small cuts on the fighter's fingers to a few reported deaths from contact with the line while riding motorcycles. In recent years, the fighting lines have evolved from the traditional cotton, rice and glass line to nylon or synthetic line coated with metallic or chemical abrasive compounds. To prevent further injury, many countries have implemented restrictions or bans {{on the use of}} <b>cutting</b> <b>line.</b> Some have set limits on the materials used to make the line, others have mandated safety devices on motorcycles when riding during kite festivals. People have been injured while fixated on capturing a cut kite. Other injuries have been due to not paying attention to one's actions while watching battles. Most of these accidents are preventable when fighting is strictly controlled to a specific arena and proper safety gear is worn by the fighters. Other accidents have occurred due to the masses of people present during large kite festivals for which kite fighting has taken the blame.|$|E
