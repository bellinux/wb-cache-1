50|$|For {{automation}} in link spinning/winding {{there is}} the so-called “in-line steamer”. The first known process of this type is the Steamatic process by Resch. In this case the heat setting process happens in between the ring spinning and the winding machines. As soon as the ring spinning frame has finished spinning, the loaded bobbins are transported into the in-line steamer. Those bobbins are steamed there with a vacuum method and dried again within seconds. After steaming and drying, the bobbins are transported on to the winding machine where they are re-wound onto a <b>cross-wound</b> <b>package.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In textile {{production}} the yarn {{is being}} withdrawn from cross-wound packages in warping and weft insertion. During unwinding there appear {{forces in the}} yarn that are approximately proportional to {{the square of the}} unwinding velocity. During unwind the yarn tension is not constant, but it oscillates within some interval. This is especially noticeable in over-end unwinding from a static cross wound packages, where the yarn is being withdrawn with a high velocity {{in the direction of the}} package axis. Even when the yarn is not strongly stressed, so that the tension does not exceed a few percent of the breaking strength, the yarn still can break sometimes. This is why we think that a <b>cross-wound</b> <b>package</b> is not an ideal form of a package and that such packages are not always made without flaws...|$|E
