Emmaus Bible College is a Biblical higher education center which teaches the Bible, {{with an emphasis}} on New Testament principles and the integration of a biblical worldview. Emmaus has a <b>Correspondence</b> School <b>division,</b> as well. Courses are available in 105 countries and in 125 languages. Emmaus Bible College has a sister institution in the United States, Emmaus Bible College, of Dubuque, Iowa.|$|R
50|$|At Ruskin College, {{students}} got {{vocational training}} and earned {{part of their}} tuition by working in the college's woodworking, sewing, canning, and farming businesses. Their coursework ranged across art, business, oratory, music, and other subjects. There were also correspondence courses in English, journalism, art, architecture, metallurgy, and several kinds of engineering. Faculty included George D. Herron and Frank Parsons, who served as dean of the <b>correspondence</b> course <b>division.</b> Unlike its British counterpart, the American Ruskin College was coeducational, as were its successors.|$|R
50|$|After World War II, Chuo University {{started a}} series of reformations along with a new School Education Act of 1947. In 1948, its <b>Correspondence</b> <b>Division</b> was annexed to its Faculty of Law. In 1949, a new {{university}} system under the School Education Act of 1947 was applied to Chuo University. Its Engineering College was abolished and new Faculty of Engineering was opened in this year. Its Faculty of Literature was established in 1951. Its Faculty of Engineering took wings and was renamed to Faculty of Science and Engineering in 1962.|$|E
50|$|The {{first use}} of {{distance}} education for Australian VET was in 1910 when Sydney Technical College launched an emergency correspondence course to train health inspectors {{at a time when}} the country was gripped by a typhoid epidemic. By 1917, what had become the <b>Correspondence</b> <b>Division</b> was offering more than 20 subjects to distance learners, using a mix of correspondence education and converted railway wagons acting as makeshift classrooms and workshops. It also later assisted Australia’s Second World War efforts by training 100,000 Australian and 43,000 US service personnel. In 1978, the service became known as the College of External Studies; in 1991, it was renamed the TAFE NSW Open Training and Education Network, or OTEN as it is now better known.|$|E

Smith, who had recently become director of the <b>correspondence</b> <b>division</b> of RCA's Radio Institute of America, and was {{well known in the}} amateur radio field through his Special Amateur station 2ZL, located in Valley Stream, New York. Smith determined that a high-powered transmitter was being built in Schenectady, New York for the U.S. Navy by RCA's parent company, General Electric. He arranged for White to meet with the former assistant Secretary of the Navy (and future president) Franklin D. Roosevelt, to get permission to use this transmitter for the proposed broadcast. Roosevelt was the president of The Navy Club, and one of the conditions for approval was that his organization share, along with the American Committee for Devastated France, in the charitable receipts. White arranged for a tug to deliver the transmitter from Schenectady.|$|E
50|$|In 1964, the Institute {{changed its}} name to the Capitol Institute of Technology to reflect its {{expansion}} during the 1950s. That same year, it sold its <b>correspondence</b> school <b>division,</b> which comprised 20% of its business, to McGraw-Hill Education. Shortly thereafter, in 1966, the District of Columbia licensed the Institute to award Bachelor of Science degrees in engineering technology. Anticipating the need for more space, the Institute decided to move to a leased facility in Kensington, Maryland, in 1969, which opened in January 1970. Six years later, in 1976, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) awarded full accreditation to the Institute.|$|R

The relation to the previous version of the theorem is that division algebras correspond to elements of a second cohomology group (the Brauer group) and under this <b>correspondence</b> the <b>division</b> algebra with Hasse invariant 1/K:F corresponds to the fundamental class.|$|R

50|$|By {{the second}} half of the 1960s, NRI {{recognized}} that its limited resources would preclude it from maintaining its leadership position within the industry in the coming decade. James Morrison Smith thus set out to find a partner/buyer. In 1968, McGraw-Hill Education agreed to purchase NRI, after having bought the <b>correspondence</b> <b>division</b> (20%) of Capitol Radio Engineering Institute in 1964. By this time, over one million students had completed an NRI course. McGraw-Hill had anticipated this would open a new market for technical books, while NRI hoped a significant advantage to the acquisition would be their ability to utilize the vast technical publishing resources of its new owner. The McGraw-Hill name began appearing in the NRI Journal in 1970. It was 1973 when the McGraw-Hill name began appearing in catalogues of copyright entries for NRI courses in the U. S. Library of Congress, and 1974 when it started to appear in magazine advertisements. After completion of the deal, the school was renamed once again to NRI Schools, and became part of a newly established McGraw-Hill Continuing Education Center.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we apply the multi-way {{decomposition}} method PARAFAC {{in order to}} detect the most prominent sound changes in dialect variation. We investigate various phonetic patterns, both in stressed and unstressed syllables. We proceed from regular sound correspondences which are automatically extracted from the aligned transcriptions and analyzed using PARAFAC. This enables us to analyze simultaneously the co-occurrence patterns of all sound correspondences found in the data set and determine {{the most important factors}} of the variation. The first ten dimensions are examined in more detail by recovering the geographical distribution of the extracted correspondences. We also compare dialect divisions based on the extracted <b>correspondences</b> to the <b>divisions</b> based on the whole data set and to the traditional scholarship as well. The results show that PAR-AFAC can be successfully used to detect the linguistic basis of the automatically obtained dialect divisions. ...|$|R
50|$|There are <b>correspondences</b> between certain <b>divisions</b> and the {{presence}} or absence of medial glides in later dialects, in ways that differ depending on the class of the initial (e.g. velar, labial, retroflex, etc.). There are also clear co-occurrence restrictions between initials and divisions, in that initials from certain of these same classes can occur with finals only from certain divisions. The LMC authors of this system appear to have been aware of these classes of initials, and seem to have determined the separation into divisions partly on the basis of the co-occurrence relationships and partly on the medial glides, although it is debated how the exact classification was made. It is important to remember that the authors of this system were attempting to use LMC phonology to reconstruct EMC phonology (although they probably thought of it more in terms of trying to harmonize the way that words were normally pronounced with the rather different system of rhymes and homophones as laid out in the Qieyun).|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) - University of Durban-Westville, 1997 The {{intention}} {{of this research}} was to gather and document qualitative data regarding young children's intuitive solution strategies with regard to multiplication and division word problems. In 1994, nineteen pupils from the Junior Primary Phase (i. e. Grade 1 and Grade 2), from a Durban school participated in this study, in which the instruction was generally compatible with the principles of the Problem-Centered mathematics approach proposed by Human et al (1993) and Murray et al (1992; 1993). Its basic premise is that learning is a social as well as an individual activity. The researcher's pragmatic framework has been greatly influenced by the views of Human et al (1993) and Murray et al (1992; 1993), on Socio-Constructivism and Problem-Centered mathematics. Ten problem structures, five in multiplication and five in division which were adopted from research carried out by Mulligan (1992), were presented to the pupils to solve. The children were observed while solving the problems and probing questions were asked to obtain information about their solution strategies. From an indepth analysis of the children's solution strategies conclusions on the following issues were drawn: 1. the relationship between the semantic structure of the word problems and the children's intuitive strategies, and 2. the intuitive models used by the children to solve these problems. The following major conclusions were drawn from the evidence: 1. Of the sample, 76 % were able to solve the ten problem structures using a range of strategies without having received any formal instruction on these concepts and related algorithms. 2. There were few differences in the children's performance between the multiplication and division word problems, {{with the exception of the}} Factor problem type for the Grade 2 Higher Ability pupils. 3. The semantic structure of the problems had a greater impact on the children's choice of strategies than on their performance, with the exception of the Factor problems. 4. The children used a number of intuitive models. For multiplication, three models were identified, i. e. repeated addition, array, cartesian product with and without many-to-many <b>correspondence.</b> For <b>division,</b> four models were identified, i. e. sharing one-by-one, building-up (additive), building-down (subtractive), and a model for sub-dividing wholes...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to examine the opinions of respondents regarding dispute resolution procedures utilized by public school teachers as described in sections 22. 1 - 312 of the Code of Virginia. In this study, demographic and opinion data were collected from individuals selected to serve as neutral chairpersons of fact-finding panels, school division superintendents or designees, local teacher association presidents, Virginia Education Association UniServ directors, and attorneys. The history, development, and intent of teacher dispute resolution procedures are presented in Chapter II. A descriptive research design was utilized. A researcher-designed survey instrument was used to gather demographic and opinion data from the five groups. Neutral chairpersons who had administrated a panel hearing were located through <b>correspondence</b> with school <b>division</b> superintendents or personnel directors and teacher association leaders in the state of Virginia. School division superintendents or designees employed in school divisions who had experienced a fact finding panel hearing were included in the investigation. The opinions of local iii teacher association presidents and UniServ directors were sought. Attorneys who had represented either a teacher or a school board during a grievance or dismissal hearing were included in the study. The information gathered was compared and analyzed statistically. Five surveys were developed for this study. The first part of each survey requested opinion data regarding the role and function of the fact-finding panel, the procedural framework of grievance and dismissal hearings, advisory fact-finding, and the experiences, training, and qualifications of neutral chairpersons.

40|$|Autorica se u prvom dijelu teksta kritički osvrće na pisanu građu iz 19. i 20. stoljeća o lastovskom pokladu, posebice na manjkave opise ženskih sudionica tzv. lijepih maškara. Drugi se dio teksta bavi problematikom ženskog lančanog plesa. U kontekstu pokladnih zbivanja Lastovo je jedinstveno jer žene izvode lančani ples s rupčićima kao supstitutima za mačeve s kojima se inače izvode slični muški lančani plesovi. Autorica pokazuje da su lijepe maškare i njihovo lančano kolo neizostavni strukturni čimbenik pokladnog zbivanja na Lastovu. In {{the first}} part of the text the author makes a {{critical}} review of the written documentation from the 19 th and 20 th centuries about the Carnival on the island of Lastovo, especially of the deficient descriptions of the female participants, the so called "lijepe maškare" (pretty maskers). In spite of the fact that the Carnival of Lastovo has already been the topic of ethnological, ethnotheatrological, and even ethnochoreological research, the author noted and in her research and interpretation pointed out that in the Carnival events women are an obligatory and irreplaceable participants of the customs during which they dance a chain dance with a handkerchief, which has in the previous research remained unnoticed or neglected and marginalized. In the second part of the text the author discusses the female chain dance. In the context of Carnival events, the island of Lastovo is a unique case where women perform a chain dance, using handkerchiefs as substitutes for swords which are used in similar male chain dances (except in Kotor, where even the members of the Boka Navy perform a chain dance with handkerchiefs). The intention of most ethnological, ethnotheatrological and ethnochoreological research so far was to discover a common mythological background and the characteristics of Carnival roles and events, putting all sword dances in the same category, disregarding the sex and gender and the more detailed choreological differences of certain performances. In accordance with recent research of sex and gender in an ethnochoreological elaboration of the customs of "slavonske kraljice" (Slavonian queens) (Čale Feldman), the author claims that dance too should be observed in an attainable and concrete context of the events observed. At the end, in accordance with the interpretation of the dance and the roles of performers in the Carnival events, she notes the <b>correspondence</b> with the <b>division</b> of sex and gender roles in everyday life of the people from Lastovo, which is still patriarchal...|$|R
6000|$|And what Organon for {{the study}} of [...] "the moral and {{intellectual}} functions" [...] does M. Comte offer, in lieu of the direct mental observation which he repudiates? We are almost ashamed to say, that it is Phrenology! Not, indeed, he says, as a science formed, but as one still to be created; for he rejects almost all the special organs imagined by phrenologists, and accepts only their general division of the brain into the three regions of the propensities, the sentiments, and the intellect,[13] and the subdivision of the latter region between the organs of meditation and those of observation. Yet this mere first outline of an apportionment of the mental functions among different organs, he regards as extricating the mental study of man from the metaphysical stage, and elevating it to the positive. The condition of mental science would be sad indeed if this were its best chance of being positive; for the later course of physiological observation and speculation has not tended to confirm, but to discredit, the phrenological hypothesis. And even if that hypothesis were true, psychological observation would still be necessary; for how is it possible to ascertain the correspondence between two things, by observation of only one of them? To establish a relation between mental functions and cerebral conformations, requires not only a parallel system of observations applied to each, but (as M. Comte himself, with some inconsistency, acknowledges) an analysis of the mental faculties, [...] "des diverses facultés élémentaires," [...] (iii. 573), conducted without any reference to the physical conditions, since the proof of the theory would lie in the <b>correspondence</b> between the <b>division</b> of the brain into organs and that of the mind into faculties, each shown by separate evidence. To accomplish this analysis requires direct psychological study carried to a high pitch of perfection; it being necessary, among other things, to investigate the degree in which mental character is created by circumstances, since no one supposes that cerebral conformation does all, and circumstances nothing. The phrenological study of Mind thus supposes as its necessary preparation the whole of the Association psychology. Without, then, rejecting any aid which study of the brain and nerves can afford to psychology (and it has afforded, and will yet afford, much), we may affirm that M. Comte has done nothing for the constitution of the positive method of mental science. He refused to profit by the very valuable commencements made by his predecessors, especially by Hartley, Brown, and James Mill (if indeed any of those philosophers were known to him), and left the psychological branch of the positive method, as well as psychology itself, to be put in their true position as a part of Positive Philosophy by successors who duly placed themselves at the twofold point of view of physiology and psychology, Mr Bain and Mr Herbert Spencer. This great mistake is not a mere hiatus in M. Comte's system, but the parent of serious errors in his attempt to create a Social Science. He is indeed very skilful in estimating the effect of circumstances in moulding the general character of the human race; were he not, his historical theory could be of little worth: but in appreciating the influence which circumstances exercise, through psychological laws, in producing diversities of character, collective or individual, he is sadly at fault.|$|R
