FeCrAl alloy honeycombs are fabricated by extruding the powder mixed paste, then dried and sintered. While sintering at 1200 °C, with sintering time increase, the volume of sintered honeycombs increase and density decrease. The structure parameters and properties of sintered honeycombs were obtained by measuring and calculating. Results show that wall thickness 0. 18 ~ 0. 23 mm, cell number (1 /in 2) 316 ~ 339, clear cross section (%) 69 ~ 74, specific surface Sv (sq m/cu dm) 2. 35 ~ 2. 52; specific heat capacity Cp(J/g. K) 0. 60 ~ 0. 70, heat conductivity k (W/m. K) 6. 52 ~ 6. 78. SEM/XRD analysis shows {{that a large number}} of oxides formed on the surface of sintered honeycombs during sintering, such as Fe 2 Cr 204, Fe 2 Si 04, Al 2 O 3. These oxides connect together to form film on surface of sintered honeycombs.

40|$|A simple, {{precise and}} fast {{procedure}} to simulate monolith reactors is presented. The method allows {{the estimation of}} effectiveness factors (η) in monolith with washcoat of irregular geometries and arbitrary catalytic activity distribution. <b>Catalytic</b> <b>washcoat</b> with the same quantity of active material, deposited in different manners, are compared in their influence on monolith reactor performance. Intrinsic effectiveness factor estimations, with the approximate method, for first order reaction gave results {{very close to the}} rigorous 2 D calculation. It is shown that differences between η values can be as much as 54 % when non uniform catalytic activity distribution is considered. It is also shown the influence of different catalyst distribution on the behavior of a monolith reactor where the isothermal NO decomposition on Cu/ZSM- 5 washcoat with complex Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic expression, is carried out. Estimated results are in close agreement with experimental findings. The influence of different catalytic activity distribution on η can be as much as 66 %, while exit NO conversion changes more than 42 %. Fil: Parentis, Mónica Liliana. Universidad Nacional de Salta.

40|$|Monolithic (honeycomb) {{catalysts}} are continuous unitary structures containing many narrow, parallel {{and usually}} straight channels (or passages). Catalytically active components are dispersed uniformly {{over the whole}} porous ceramic monolith structure (so-called incorporated monolithic catalysts) or are in a layer of porous material that is deposited {{on the walls of}} channels in the monolith's structure (washcoated monolithic catalysts). The material of the main monolithic construction is not limited to ceramics but includes metals, as well. Monolithic catalysts are commonly used in gas phase catalytic processes, such as treatment of automotive exhaust gases, selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides, catalytic removal of volatile organic compounds from industrial processes, etc. Monoliths continue to be the preferred support for environmental applications due to their high geometric surface area, different design options, low pressure drop, high temperature durability, mechanical strength, ease of orientation in a reactor and effectiveness as a support for a <b>catalytic</b> <b>washcoat.</b> As known, monolithic catalysts belong to the class of the structured catalysts and/or reactors (in some cases the distinction between "catalyst" and "reactor" has vanished). Structured catalysts can greatly intensify chemical processes, resulting in smaller, safer, cleaner and more energy efficient technologies. Monolith reactors can be considered as multifunctional reactors, in which chemical conversion is advantageously integrated with another unit operation, such as separation, heat exchange, a secondary reaction, etc. Finally, structured catalysts and/or reactors appear {{to be one of the}} most significant and promising developments in the field of heterogeneous catalysis and chemical engineering of the recent years. This paper gives a description of the background and perspectives for application and development of monolithic materials. Different methods and techniques used in the preparation of monolithic catalysts are described. Several commercial applications of monolithic catalysts are presented. New applications and the associated technical challenges for the monolithic catalyst and reactors are discussed as well...|$|E
40|$|The {{demanding}} {{legislation for}} vehicle emissions pushes {{the automotive industry}} to the commercialization of advanced exhaust systems. The careful design of each aftertreatment device fitted in exhaust line and the interactions with the engine management, makes modelling {{an important part of}} systems engineering for these applications. Almost all catalytic converter models that are found in the literature use tunable parameters which typically address the kinetic terms of chemical reactions. A great effort has been given to the definition of complex reaction schemes and mechanistic description of them in-vitro, in order to assist the advanced design of <b>catalytic</b> <b>washcoats</b> and explain their complex chemistry. This paper presents a systematic effort towards the modelling of advanced commercial exhaust treatment systems, using a unified approach for the different devices. The model used in this work describes the catalytic processes with global reactions, using apparent Arrhenius type rate expressions with L-H kinetics. The model is used to predict transient performance of commercial catalytic converters under legislated test conditions. During these tests the existing uncertainties and intrinsic variations of engine and catalyst operation make the robustness and flexibility of the model prominent targets. Comparison of computed and measured second-by-second emissions demonstrate a high level of modelling accuracy, adequate to fit the behavior of advanced commercial applications of three-way catalytic converters and NOx traps, using a minimum set of 3 tunable parameters for each device.

40|$|The {{effective}} mass diffusivity 〈 D m 〉 of large specific surface area catalytic porous coatings is analyzed using 2 -D network models of connecting arms and verified experimentally for a multiple pore length scale coating layer. The network model includes effects {{of variation in}} the lattice randomness (Voronoi tessellation {{in the form of}} Delaunay lattice triangulation), pore coordination number, pore size (Knudsen effect), and pore-size distribution on the predicted 〈 D m 〉. The effect of pore poisoning, resulting in a pore blockage, is analyzed. Correlations for the porosity and pore-blockage dependency of 〈 D m 〉, as well as relationships for the pore size (low-dimensionality) and multiple pore length scale effects, are also discussed.

Pt in low loading (0. 5 wt%) was employed as the only active phase. Washcoats varying in the solid solution composition (CexZryLazO delta), prepared by coprecipitation, are comparatively investigated {{in an attempt to}} elucidate the effect of Ce, Zr and La oxide promoters on the catalytic activity and thermal durability. For this purpose, catalytic activity measurements as well as detailed structural and morphological evaluations (differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), N- 2 adsorption, oxygen storage capacity and DRIFTS analyses) were carried out before and after thermal aging in oxidative atmosphere. The catalytic performance was studied in loaded cordierite monoliths (TWCs form) under simulated exhaust conditions at the stoichiometric point. Doping ceria with Zr and La cation proved beneficial for both catalytic performance and thermal durability of the washcoat, with Ce 0. 4 Zr 0. 5 La 0. 1 O 1. 9 /gamma-Al 2 O 3 /Pt sample presenting the optimum properties. The catalytic behavior is discussed based on oxygen storage capacity, noble metal dispersion and textural characteristics of the examined samples. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{previous}} {{analysis of}} experiments of H 2 fuel-rich combustion over a Rh catalyst—reported in Maestri et al. [2007. Role of gas-phase chemistry {{in the rich}} combustion of H 2 and CO over a Rh/Al 2 O 3 catalyst in annular reactor. Chemical Engineering Science 62, 4992 – 4997]—has been extended using a detailed surface kinetic model coupled with a detailed kinetic scheme for H 2 gas-phase combustion. The model is now able to investigate possible interactions between the surface and homogeneous chemistries. Results suggest that the homogeneous chemistry played a role, especially at high temperatures. In the intermediate range of temperatures, where the experimental conversion data are systematically higher than those corresponding to the diffusive limit, model predictions revealed that a very weak interaction between the gas-phase and surface kinetics occurs. In fact, the fraction of radicals that desorbs from the surface is significantly lower than that {{needed in order to}} partially activate the homogeneous process. Finally, we accounted for the presence of zones upstream and downstream of the main catalytic bed with a low catalytic activity. These sections could be related to non-uniformity of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>washcoat</b> at the boundaries of the catalytic bed, uncertainty of the beginning and ending of the washcoat layer, and possible evaporation and redeposition of the catalyst. We show that such low activity sections could significantly increase the conversion above the diffusive limit and provide a plausible mechanism to rationalize the experimental data. Moreover, dynamic simulations further revealed that under isothermal conditions the ignition of the homogenous process is governed by a build-up of a “radical pool” at the reactor back end followed by upstream propagation: axial diffusivity is crucial in order to model appropriately the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is devoted}} to the study of dynamic {{behaviour}} of monolithic catalytic reactors in dependence of inlet conditions. The first part of the Thesis contains the description of experimental set-ups for the measurement of spatially 2 D spatiotemporal temperature patterns inside the monolithic structure in course of the light-off behaviour and other nonstationary inlet conditions. The experimental set-ups enabled to obtain evolution of 2 D spatiotemporal temperature patterns for different inlet flow velocity distributions and for periodically varying inlet flow conditions. Two methods for the measurement of spatiotemporal patterns (dynamic and stationary) were tested for different reactor inlet conditions. The inlet temperature was varied in the range 20 - 450 C, the inlet flow rates of reaction mixture corresponded to SV from 3000 h- 1 to 200 000 h- 1. The reaction mixture based on air as carrier gas and admixtures of NO, CO and propene was used. Inlet NO and propene concentrations could be up to thousands of vol. ppm, while the CO concentration could reach several volume per cent. The experiments were carried out for two types of monolithic supports - metallic and ceramic, with the <b>catalytic</b> <b>washcoat</b> Pt on alumina and Pt/Rh on alumina for ceramic support and Pt on alumina for metallic one. The results of experiments illustrate different types of dynamic behaviour of monolithic catalytic reactor under light-off process for different conditions, e. g. different inlet temperature and inlet flow distributions (uniform and nonuniform). Influence of inlet flow velocity distributions was also studied for periodically varying inlet conditions. The last part of experimental results presents comparison of behaviour of metallic and ceramic monolithic reactors under nonstationary operations, e. g. periodic alternations of flows of reaction mixture and cooling gas controlling temperature profile within the reactor {{in such a way that}} high NOx reduction is reached. The results of nonstationary experiments were compared with numerical simulations. The possibility to increase NOx reduction by periodic variation of inlet conditions for currently available Pt/Al 2 O 3 monolitic catalysts has been documented. Developed spatially 2 D mathematical model of monolithic reactor could give some information on the behaviour of the reactor under different inlet conditions.

40|$|ABSTRACT Title of Dissertation:	EVALUATING SURFACE MECHANISMS FOR CATALYTIC COMBUSTION OF H 2 AND CH 4 ON Pd CATALYSTS Seyed-Abdolreza Seyed-Reihani, Doctor of Philosophy, 2005 Dissertation {{directed}} by:	Associate Professor Gregory Jackson Department of Mechanical Engineering 		Applications of fuel-lean {{catalytic combustion}} for power generation and exhaust heat recovery {{have raised the}} desire for reactor optimization. Such optimization requires adequately detailed surface chemistry models to predict reactor performance over {{a broad range of}} conditions relevant to the application. This study presents experimental studies in well-defined micro-reactors for catalytic combustion of CH 4 and H 2 on g-Al 2 O 3 supported Pd catalysts, which are used to evaluate and refine surface chemistry mechanisms. The experimental results are compared to predictions by a transient numerical model for a catalytic channel flow with intra-phase diffusion in the porous washcoat support. Mechanisms for low temperature ( 400 ºC) CH 4 combustion under excess O 2 have been developed and evaluated by comparison of experimental results in well-defined microreactors with transient model predictions. Low-temperature catalytic combustion over Pd-catalysts of very lean H 2 /O 2 mixture diluted in N 2 has been studied in the <b>catalytic</b> <b>washcoat</b> micro-reactor with transient exhaust monitoring using mass spectrometry. Experimental results reveal the important features of the Pd-H 2 -O 2 surface chemistry under excess O 2, particularly the effects of competitive adsorption/desorption of both the reactants and H 2 O product. Results show that H 2 conversion depends on equivalence ratio at temperatures £ 125 °C and on H 2 O vapor < 125 °C. A proposed multi-step surface chemistry predicts based on detailed elementary reaction steps with thermodynamic reversibility and surface species interaction potentials captures the trends for conversion with respect to inlet temperature and water vapor. Intrinsic low dimensional manifolds (ILDM) were identified for the heterogeneous Pd-H 2 -O 2 kinetics and the results show how specific species equilibration define the slowest modes in the catalytic reaction system. For the fuel lean CH 4 oxidation over supported Pd catalysts, isothermal time-on-stream microreactor experiments and heating/cooling cyclic tests from 400 °C to 850 °C revealed the effects of PdO reduction/reoxidation on CH 4 combustion kinetics. Test results with different H 2 O concentration revealed that competitive CH 4 and H 2 O adsorption impacts on the activity only under catalyst conditions dominated by PdO. A detailed Pd-CH 4 -O 2 surface mechanism predicts the impact of Pd reduction/reoxidation on CH 4 oxidation rates. A post-process sensitivity analysis reveals the important reactions steps and provides a means for improving the detailed mechanism for predicting the complex hysteretic kinetics of CH 4 oxidation on Pd...|$|E
40|$|Fe-Cr-Al {{is used as}} {{metallic}} {{support for}} catalytic converter due to its high thermal conductivity, lower heat capacity, high temperature and mechanical shock resistance. γ-Al 2 O 3 is {{the most widely used}} material as washcoat which embedded on metallic support for the catalytic converter application. The problem is the coating adhesion between the metallic support and the ceramic washcoat becomes a problem in long-term high temperature oxidation. On the other hand, the gamma phase of alumina will be transformed to alpha phase at high temperature. The ultrasonic technique via cavitation bubbles and high velocity can make surface deformation and also accelerate the γ-Al 2 O 3 powders to bombardment occurred on the Fe-Cr-Al surface. This process generates sufficiently heat and γ-Al 2 O 3 layer can be formed on the Fe-Cr-Al surface. Subsequently, electroplating process embeds the nickel and also can strengthen the adhesion when oxidized.

40|$|New {{techniques}} for preparation of catalytic materials with novel properties {{are presented in}} this thesis. Three new <b>catalytic</b> materials; <b>washcoated</b> fibres, highly dispersed metal oxides on titania coated silica particles and discrete colloidal ZSM- 5 crystals with a low SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio have been prepared and characterised. The catalytic properties of cobalt oxide and ceria promoted noble metals, and Cu-ZSM- 5 catalysts made of commercial and discrete colloidal ZSM- 5 crystals have been evaluated. Porous coatings were applied to alumina and silica fibre substrates by a stepwise procedure comprising charge reversal of the fibres, electrostatic adsorption of sol particles and fixing of the sol particles onto the fibre surface. Charged polymers proved to be excellent for charge reversal of fibre substrates owing to low sensitivity to dilution, whereas charge reversal was more difficult to accomplish with low molecular weight agents. The role of the charge reversing agent in the coating of the fibre substrates is discussed. Oxides of cerium(IV), iron(III), chromium(III), manganese(II), tin(II), nickel(II) and cobalt(II) and sulfides of nickel(II) and cobalt(II) were highly dispersed {{on the surface of}} TiO 2 /SiO 2 particles with a particle size in the range 80 - 500 nm by a stepwise procedure. The mechanisms of controlled deposition of metal hydrous oxides on substrate particles are discussed. Discrete colloidal ZSM- 5 crystals with a SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio in the range 40 - 80 were prepared in a joint project by autoclaving an aluminosilicate gel at 120 - 160 °C formed upon mixing of TPAOH containing silicate and aluminate solutions. A high synthesis temperature was found to favour the incorporation of aluminium in the zeolite structure. The size of the crystals increased with decreasing SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio. Catalysts made of discrete Cu-ZSM- 5 crystals exhibited a higher NO-reducing ability in oxygen excess atmosphere compared with catalysts made of commercial Cu-ZSM- 5 crystals of the same SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio and copper exchange level. The low temperature oxidation of CO and propene over alumina supported Pt and Pd was significantly affected by the reactant gas stoichiometry, promoting oxide and pretreatment atmosphere. Prereduced cobalt oxide exhibited a light-off performance that resembles those normally observed over noble metal catalysts, whereas preoxidised cobalt oxide performed as regular catalytically active metal oxides. The support particles (Al 2 O 3,TiO 2 /SiO 2) were found not to affect the light-off performance of prereduced Pt/Co 3 O 4 catalysts under the experimental conditions used. A mechanism to explain the remarkable low temperature activity over prereduced cobalt oxide is suggested...|$|R
