50|$|The {{curriculum}} at Buckingham High School was <b>collegiate</b> in <b>nature.</b> Course offerings were limited - mathematics (algebra, geometry & trigonometry), English, French, science (physics & chemistry), {{as well as}} history and geography. Latin was offered in the 1950s but this course was dropped due to insufficient enrolment. There were no optional courses beyond high school industrial arts for the boys and home economics for the girls.

50|$|By 1977 it was {{accepted}} {{that the original}} name was inadequate. It did not reflect the <b>collegiate</b> <b>nature</b> of the community’s lifestyle, neither did it {{do justice to the}} study in which many of the residents continued to be engaged. So it was that the name was changed to become The College of St Barnabas. In the second century of its life, the college is still functioning and is now furnished with modern amenities such as broadband internet connections in residents’ rooms. The development has seen the substantial upgrading of the nursing wing from a ward to individual private rooms, the cloisters to include en suite facilities, and the addition of further rooms for residential care. One of its better known residents was the Reverend Dr. John Stott, a leader of the worldwide evangelical movement.|$|E
50|$|Although some member {{churches of}} the Anglican Communion title their {{primates}} as Primate or Primate Bishop, most churches use other titles for their primates. Following {{the style of}} the Archbishop of Canterbury, many Anglican primates are styled Archbishop. They are either named after the most important episcopal see in the church (like the Archbishop of Cape Town) or named after the province they lead (like the Archbishop of Nigeria). The Scottish Episcopal Church uniquely calls its primate Primus. Other churches have followed the example of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America by calling the primate Presiding Bishop, or President Bishop. These latter titles emphasize the <b>collegiate</b> <b>nature</b> of episcopate rather than the personal authority of the primate. The primates of the Church of South India, Church of North India, Church of Pakistan and Church of Bangladesh are called Moderators, reflecting their Methodist and Presbyterian heritage. Some primates head a diocese, but some are relieved from diocesan responsibility to concentrate on leading the wider church (the Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada for example).|$|E
50|$|County {{college was}} the only college to be named after its benefactors, the County Council, who donated a generous sum of money towards its {{construction}} and promised to donate £50,000 a year for 10 years towards the university’s running costs. A commemorative plaque situated outside the college office remembers their generous contribution.It was decided that County college should be based upon the old Oxonian idea of building colleges around a quadrangle because it adds to the <b>collegiate</b> <b>nature</b> of the university and expresses {{the idea of an}} individual community.The only way that a square could be incorporated into County was around an old oak tree that had been spared as a sapling by an agricultural labourer over 200 years ago. This original college building is now known as County Main. The building was erected around the tree without damage to its roots. The College is very conscious of its responsibility for the health of the tree and beneath its shade are two bench seats erected in memory of two former College Officers.|$|E
50|$|It dates its {{founding}} to 1107 after Henry I of England granted the lands and castle to Robert de Beaumont, although Henry Knighton implies that an Anglo-Saxon college of St Mary had existed and Robert merely refurbished it. Robert established {{it within the}} castle bailey as a college served by a Dean and 12 Canons (that is, a collegiate church) in honour of the Virgin Mary and All Souls and as a chantry chapel for the souls of him, his family and the first three Norman kings. He endowed this and four other churches with £6 of his income and land {{in or near the}} city. However, in 1143 these endowments were all transferred by his son Robert le Bossu, 2nd Earl of Leicester, to his own new Augustinian foundation of Leicester Abbey. The collegiate church retained, or had restored to it a Dean, six Clerks and a Chaplain, along with Robert de Beaumont's grant of 20 shillings for lamps. It also retained parish offerings and most of the tithes. The <b>collegiate</b> <b>nature</b> of the church lasted until the college was disbanded in 1548 under the Chantry act of Edward VI.|$|E
5000|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of ordained ministers in the Anglican Communion are priests (also called presbyters). Priestly ministry is derived from that of bishops {{in that they are}} licensed to a cure of souls by a diocesan or area bishop. The <b>collegiate</b> <b>nature</b> of the presbyterate is acknowledged every time a new priest is ordained as other priests share with the ordaining bishop in the laying on of hands. All priests are entitled to be styled The Reverend and many male priests are called Father. Some senior priests have other titles. Many member churches ordain women to the priesthood. There is as yet no widely used alternative title to [...] "Father" [...] for female priests. Priests traditionally wear a (usually) black cassock or clergy shirt - although many now wear clergy shirts in other colours. In worship, the traditional vesture for Anglican priests is their choir dress of cassock, surplice, academic hood (if one has been awarded) and a black tippet. However, at the Eucharist, the revived pre-Reformation vestments of alb, stole, chasuble and occasionally the amice and maniple, are worn in large sections of the Communion. Even in cases where a priest is not presiding at the Eucharist, he or she may wear a surplice or alb with a stole.|$|E
40|$|After having briefly {{presented}} some {{institutional aspects}} of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the present report analyses forty of its leading cases {{in order to assess}} the general characteristics of the legal reasoning developed by the Court in interpreting the Treaties. The report underlines the importance of teleological interpretation and arguments from precedents, the frequency and cogency of the arguments based on the principle of the rule of law, the difficulty for the Court in referring to the political nature of the Union and the tendency to eschew constitutional rhetoric. Above all, the report underlines the high degree of impersonality that the Court is able to achieve in its judgments and concludes that it depends on a variety of factors such as the <b>collegiate</b> <b>nature</b> of the judgments, their subject matter, the declining but persisting influence of the French model, the need for translation and informatisation, the extensive use of precedents and literal self-quotations, and the contradictory and unsettled status of the Court of Justice as sensu lato constitutional court of the European legal space...|$|E
40|$|Introduction There is {{a growing}} public {{perception}} that serious medical error is commonplace and largely tolerated by the medical profession. The Government and medical establishment's response to this perceived epidemic of error has included tighter controls over practising doctors and individual stick-and-carrot reforms of medical practice. Discussion This paper critically reviews the literature on medical error, professional socialization and medical student education, and suggests that common themes such as uncertainty, necessary fallibility, exclusivity of professional judgement and extensive use of medical networks find their genesis, in part, in aspects of medical education and socialization into medicine. The nature and comparative failure of recent reforms of medical practice and {{the tension between the}} individualistic nature of the reforms and the <b>collegiate</b> <b>nature</b> of the medical profession are discussed. Conclusion A more theoretically informed and longitudinal approach to decreasing medical error might be to address the genesis of medical thinking about error through reforms to the aspects of medical education and professional socialization that help to create and perpetuate the existence of avoidable error, and reinforce medical collusion concerning error. Further changes in the curriculum to emphasize team working, communication skills, evidence-based practice and strategies for managing uncertainty are therefore potentially key components in helping tomorrow's doctors to discuss, cope with and commit fewer medical errors...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The Council of the Australasian College of Legal Medicine (ACLM) {{considered}} it timely to survey its membership {{to determine how}} to best accommodate its members' needs. Methods: A questionnaire was devised, piloted and circulated amongst the 219 College members (excluding the 13 Honorary Fellows). Yield was maximised with 4 direct mailings, 4 questionnaire insertions in the quarterly College newsletter, 3 targeted emails and follow-up phone calls. Results: The survey achieved 160 (73 %) response rate of whom w 40 % were substantially involved in legal and forensic medicine and w 40 % were occasionally involved. Thirty-five participants (23 %) specialised in forensic medicine and 101 (63 %) held Fellowship status in other recognised medical specialities. Equal 1 / 3 of the members had been so for > 10 years, 5 e 10 years or < 5 years, demonstrating the dynamic nature of the College. Of them 53 % were Fellows, 26 % Members and 21 % Associates with 50 % of the latter groups willing to train towards Fellowship. About half the respondents (48 %) regularly attended the Annual Scientific Meeting (ASM) and favoured the Eastern border for such meetings. The <b>collegiate</b> <b>nature</b> of the College was deemed its most positive aspect with a dichotomy of views regarding seeking alternative strand affiliation for specialist recognition, although 80 % indicated they would retain College membership even if such affiliation occurred. Those who attended College educative programs found them useful but attendance was between 32 and 49 %, depending on the course. Discussion: There appeared widespread satisfaction with College performance and activities but a low uptake of educative courses, other than Annual Scientific Meetings, thereby identifying marketing of courses as needing extra attention.

40|$|In {{the late}} 1980 s, in Britain, teacher {{retention}} {{was an important}} issue in public education, with inner city schools suffering most from teachers' unwillingness to be retained. Most labour market studies, even those written about teachers, concentrate on the 'demand side' : there are few empirical studies of the supply side. Those researched {{from the perspective of}} the employees themselves are rare. A literature search yielded three main categories of supply side job satisfactions : groupings of 0 intrinsic, extrinsic and contextual factors. A research approach was developed to establish the significance and stability of such factors in teaching. The method was one of refinement from qualitative exploration to quantitative explanation. The field work began with an analysis of student writings about their most valued experiences in informal educational settings, continued with interviews with four head teachers and tested the abstracted satisfaction characteristics with two populations : trainee teachers and established teachers. The retention factors identified were adequate resources, colleagues, community support and the feeling of doing a worthwhile job allowing for personal and professional development, in the 0 context of stable educational policy. Results were obtained by correlation and principal components analysis. A contrast is drawn between quit factors and stay factors. This analysis focuses on the <b>collegiate</b> <b>nature</b> of schools and teaching. Experienced tea 6 hers concur, extending this collegiality towards 00 relationships with the community through parents and governing bodies. Gender is found to be a b consistent correlate. The conclusion discusses retention and motivation in the light of the findings. Retention policies are found to omit the professional concerns of teachers. In effect, evidence of vocationalism challenges the dependence of retention on extrinsic as distinct from intrinsic and contextual factors. Gender seems to be systematically ignored by employers, particularly in attempts to proletarianise teaching, despite the statistical evidence that it is a ferninised occupation...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{virtually}} no {{research into the}} academic or <b>collegiate</b> <b>nature</b> of university halls and colleges in Australia despite a 150 year history. It is a history that can be viewed over three periods of development, the denominational, the secular and the independent periods. However, collegiate models that were established in the denominational era were done {{in the context of}} secular universities and in a competitive rather than co-operative spirit with other churches. The same model of academic support established in Australian colleges in the earliest period seems to prevail in the current promotional literature of colleges. This study sets out to explore the nature of academic support in the context of university residential colleges with a view to identifying best practices. Supplementary to this aim was the need to examine the nature of the college as a living and learning environment and the expectations and adjustments of students to university and college. Six models of academic support in colleges are identified in this study. The one most espoused by colleges is the Academic Intervention Model. This entails the use of postgraduates as academic advisors or consultants by appointment. They may run additional tutorials in subjects or be available for personal consultancy and have other pastoral, social and disciplinary duties. This model is, in fact, espoused more than all five other models combined including the Peer Assistance Model where mutual academic support was seen to occur naturally with very little administrative demands upon the college. The mentoring literature revealed that learning amongst individuals at an informal, personal and even private level was universal and ubiquitous. The nature of colleges seemed to indicate that they created an ideal environment in which peer tutoring, peer mentoring and peer assistance could thrive. They are living and learning environments where, on average, 200 students with a similar purpose come together, having left home, in search of greater independence, new experiences, new relationships and, most of all, supportive friendships. Surveys of students across 12 colleges, including three in the United States, demonstrated that not only did residential students access academic support most often from each other, but that they accessed tutors in residence, the most established source of academic support in college, least of all categories including faculty academics. In fact, students sought academic support from each other, especially in college, more than all other categories of support combined. The development of peer assistance models at Weerona College, University of Wollongong, was examined as a specific case study. The peer assistance model is perceived as allowing for a non-intervening approach to propagating a network of academic support in college. It is seen to release many benefits for individual students, the college and the broader university in developing a genuine learning culture that further enhances the academic support impact of the tutor in residence. In addition, the implications for further research into the much neglected area of learning outside the classroom; that is, the informal learning we all do amongst our friends, family, workmates, tutors and mentors, are extensive, important and go unrecognized and undervalued...|$|E
