5|$|Many critics {{repeatedly}} {{asserted that}} she was calling {{for the elimination of}} all pesticides. Yet Carson had made it <b>clear</b> <b>she</b> was not advocating the banning or complete withdrawal of helpful pesticides, but was instead encouraging responsible and carefully managed use with an awareness of the chemicals' impact on the entire ecosystem. In fact, she concludes her section on DDT in Silent Spring not by urging a total ban, but with advice for spraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance.|$|E

Ben tells her he is leaving town, but Clara makes it <b>clear</b> <b>she</b> has fallen in love with him. An elated Will confides to Minnie that life is so good, he may have to live forever.|$|E
5|$|According to Rose, {{the police}} let {{themselves}} into the house using Floyd's keys, without knocking or announcing themselves, while Cynthia and her family were watching television. The family said that an officer pushed Cynthia, causing her to fall. The officer denied this; the police said {{she had not been}} pushed but had simply collapsed. When it became <b>clear</b> <b>she</b> had stopped breathing, the same officer tried to revive her using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, to no avail. The pathologist testified at the inquest that the fall may have been a precipitating factor; the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, following the coroner's direction that such a verdict would mean Cynthia had been pushed, but perhaps accidentally.|$|E

5|$|Irene {{remained}} {{confined in}} a palace at the Harbour of Eleutherios {{in the capital}} and retained her formal title as empress. Then, on 15 January 792, for reasons not <b>clear,</b> <b>she</b> was recalled to the imperial palace with her title as empress and co-ruler confirmed and her name restored in the imperial acclamations. Staurakios too {{seems to have been}} recalled and, along with Irene, again took {{an active role in the}} governance of the state. This turn of events drove the Armeniacs once again to mutiny, but their commander, Alexios Mosele, was in Constantinople. Despite guarantees of safety, Mosele was imprisoned and later blinded at the instigation of Irene and Staurakios, both eager to take revenge for his role in their overthrow in 790.|$|E
5|$|On 7 September La Fleche {{ran in the}} St Leger on a wet day at Doncaster. Orme, who had {{returned}} from his problems to win the Eclipse Stakes started favourite, with La Fleche, ridden on this occasion by John Watts, strongly supported at 7/2. Watts settled the filly {{in the early stages}} as Orme set off in front. Just after the turn into the straight, La Fleche, travelling strongly, moved alongside her stable companion and then pulled <b>clear.</b> <b>She</b> won easily by two lengths from the fast-finishing Sir Hugo, with Orme fading into fifth. On 24 September, La Fleche ran against older and younger horses in the £10,000 Lancashire Plate over one mile at Manchester Racecourse. Ridden by Barrett, she tracked the leaders until the straight, where she accelerated impressively to win by three lengths from Orvieto, with Sir Hugo unplaced.|$|E

5|$|The {{final section}} of Brood War sees the player helping Sarah Kerrigan defeat the UED. With the Overmind falling under the United Earth Directorate's command, all {{operations}} amongst native factions in the sector are damaged, including Kerrigan's forces. To begin {{the campaign against}} the Directorate forces, Kerrigan and Samir Duran form a reluctant alliance with Jim Raynor, Protoss praetor Fenix, and Arcturus Mengsk to destroy the psi disrupter. After destroying the psi disrupter, the player leads Kerrigan's forces in a full-scale assault on Korhal, quickly breaking the UED's hold over the planet. In the aftermath, Kerrigan betrays her allies, destroying {{a large number of}} Dominion forces and killing both Fenix and Mengsk's right-hand man, Edmund Duke. Angry at Kerrigan's betrayal, Raynor promises that he will kill her one-day and then retreats. Kerrigan travels with Duran to Shakuras and abducts Raszagal, who she uses to blackmail Zeratul into killing the Overmind on Char, thus bringing all Zerg forces under Kerrigan's control. Zeratul attempts to rescue Raszagal, but the player prevents their escape, and Zeratul eventually kills Raszagal when it becomes <b>clear</b> <b>she</b> has been irreversibly brainwashed by Kerrigan. At that moment it becomes clear that Aldaris's uprising in the first episode was an attempt to stop the brainwashed Raszagal from betraying her people any further. Upon leaving Char in search of Artanis, Zeratul stumbles upon a genetics facility run by Duran without Kerrigan's knowledge where a Protoss/Zerg hybrid is being developed. At the same time, Kerrigan is attacked on Char by the Dominion, the UED, and a vengeful fleet commanded by Artanis. Despite being outnumbered, Kerrigan defeats all three fleets and eradicates the surviving UED fleet, leaving her the dominant power in the sector. Before the UED fleet is wiped out, Admiral DuGalle sends a final message back to his family before committing suicide with his pistol.|$|E

At this point, polls showed her to be much more popular than her closest competitor, former Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, and other Socialist heavyweights Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Jack Lang, another former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and François Hollande.|$|E

25|$|The {{recently}} discovered inscription for Nefertiti as queen in Regnal Year 16, if verified, {{seems to make}} <b>clear</b> <b>she</b> was still alive and still queen. What Egyptologists will make of {{it remains to be}} seen, but with proof of her alive in Year 16, it could be seen as supporting her candidacy as Neferneferuaten. On the other hand, advocates for Smenkhkare may make the case that since she attested as queen just before the start of Akhenaten's final regnal year, then Smenkhkare {{is more likely to be}} Akhenaten's successor.|$|E
25|$|At the World Championships, Vlašić competed against Ariane Friedrich. During the final, the duo {{was joined}} by reigning world silver and olympic bronze {{medalist}} Anna Chicherova, who took the lead with a 2,02 m first-time clearance. Vlašić went on to clear at the second time, while Friedrich did it at the third time of asking. At 2,04 m, the Croatian is the early one to go over. Chicherova fails and Friedrich keeps her final attempt at 2,06 m, which she were very close to <b>clear.</b> <b>She</b> then raised the bar at 2,10 m, at a would-be world record, but failed on the three occasions.|$|E
25|$|Bree was {{released}} from her psychiatric hospital and returned to Ferndale after Brooke's husband Boyd (Sam Bunkall) plead to her to donate a kidney to a sick Brooke. It soon turned out Bree {{had no intention of}} donating and blackmailed Boyd for thousands of dollars in exchange for the operation. Nonetheless, Bree bailed and Brooke paid her off to leave Ferndale. Bree returned claiming she had suffered another psychotic episode, though it was soon <b>clear</b> <b>she</b> had in fact murdered Travis Corfield (John Tui) and had returned to steal his money. Bree eventually confessed this to Brooke and tried to escape, only for her own sister to hand her into the police.|$|E

25|$|As {{the men and}} Mimì dine at the cafe, Musetta, {{formerly}} Marcello's sweetheart, {{arrives with}} her rich (and elderly) government minister admirer, Alcindoro, whom she is tormenting. It is <b>clear</b> <b>she</b> has tired of him. To the delight of the Parisians and the embarrassment of her patron, she sings a risqué song (Musetta's waltz: Quando me'n vo'—"When I go along"), hoping to reclaim Marcello's attention. The ploy works; at the same time, Mimì recognizes that Musetta truly loves Marcello. To be rid of Alcindoro for a bit, Musetta pretends to be suffering from a tight shoe and sends him to the shoemaker to get her shoe mended. Alcindoro leaves, and Musetta and Marcello fall rapturously into each other's arms.|$|E

A swimming coach advised her to do track because there were already several top swimmers in the Netherlands at that time (such as Rie Mastenbroek), and she would have a better chance to qualify for the Olympics in a track event.|$|E
25|$|In the Dunphy family, while Phil (Ty Burrell) is at work, {{his father}} Frank (Fred Willard) {{comes to his}} house to visit with his RV and a dog named Scout without telling Claire (Julie Bowen) that the dog is for them.

Claire tells Phil, but Phil does not believe this. Claire finally convinces Phil to ask his father what is wrong, though when he gets ready to ask, Phil instead avoids it with another question. Claire continues to be bothered by the dog, though it becomes <b>clear</b> <b>she</b> begins bonding with it. Finally, Phil asks Frank what is wrong and Frank tells Phil he fell in love, making Phil think his parents are divorcing. Then he says {{he fell in love with}} a he...Scout. Phil tells him he can take Scout home and Claire, who ends up being the most upset that Scout is leaving, gives Scout her bra. Frank then leaves with Luke (Nolan Gould) chasing the RV like a dog.|$|E
