Under light excitation, this resonant peak (e 1) shifts to lower voltages. This shift is an evidence that the hole charge density has increased in the double-barrier region. Actually, an increase of the hole density in the QW reduces the total charge accumulated in the QW and shifts the electron resonant peak to lower voltages. The hole density at the accumulation layer also increases when we increase the applied voltage which results in the formation of a 2 DHG next to the <b>collector</b> <b>barrier</b> (at the surface side, as illustrated in Figure 1 a). As mentioned earlier, the energy position of confined levels in the 2 DHG and QW can be voltage controlled. The hole resonant tunneling condition can be obtained by the alignment between the confined levels at the accumulation layer (2 DHG) and QW. This effect is evidenced by the observation of an additional structure at 0.125 V in the I(V) curve under light excitation which {{was associated with}} the first heavy hole resonance (hh 1) (Figure 1 c). This additional structure hh 1 is better defined under magnetic field (Figure 1 d). In addition, we have observed that photocurrent under low voltages is markedly larger than the electron current in the dark, which indicates that the holes actually become the effective majority carrier under this voltage condition.|$|E
40|$|Ankara : Department of Physics and Institute of Engineering and Science, Bilkent Univ., 1997. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Bilkent University, 1997. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 92 - 97. Modern semiconductor {{growth and}} processing techiques {{have provided the}} capability of fabricating a huge variety of devices which have atomically precise layered structures and lateral patterns with nanometer sizes. This not only provided novel device possibilités but also opened a new field in condensed matter physics, so called mesoscopics. It does not seem likely that the mesoscopic electronic devices {{will be available in}} the near future. Two main obstacles for mesoscopic electronics are the low temperature requirements and the breakdown of the phase coherence of the carriers as their energies exceed the Fermi level. This strongly suggests the investigation of the excited carriers with energies well in excess of their thermal equilibrium energy as the dimensions shrink. In this thesis, the interactions of hot electrons in semiconductor and metal structures with deep submicron characteristic dimensions have been studied. Tunneling Hot Electron Transfer Amplifier (THETA) constructed by abrupt semiconductur heterojunctions is a perfect system to analyze the interaction of hot electrons with cold electrons and the other possible excitations in solids. Recently, it has been discovered that an electron multiplication effect took place in such devices under certain conditions and resulted in a transfer ratio of greater than unity. In this work a novel fabrication technique has been developed. It would make it possible to utilize this effect for fabrication of a high frequency oscillator in the THz regime, in a future work. In addition, a kind of lateral THETA device has been constructed using a Two Dimensional Electron Gas structure. Electron multiplication effect for the first time has been observed in 2 DEG structures. Moreover, the dependence of the effect on parameters such as injection energy, emitter and <b>collector</b> <b>barrier</b> heights and electron transit length has been investigated. The other direction of the work has been the investigation of metal wires under extremely high current densities.

40|$|High density {{magnetic}} recording, magnetic {{random access}} memories, displacement and current detection, contactless switching and electronic compass applications all require magnetic field sensors with unprecedented sensitivity. The spin-valve effect (giant magnetoresistance) found in 1988 in magnetic metallic multilayers provided {{a new form}} of magnetoresistance with promising possibilities. The name indicates its physical origin: the magnetic layers form magnetic field controllable valves for electrons with parallel spins, leading to low resistance under application of a magnetic field. The resistance is usually measured using a four point technique, with the current in plane. Now, ten years later, the first hard disk incorporating this effect has reached the marketplace. Its read head shows a spin-valve effect of about 5 % allowing for a capacity of 16. 8 Gbyte. The use of the much larger perpendicular spin-valve effect was limited because of the ultra low perpendicular resistance of the atomically thin multilayers. Subject of this thesis is the spin valve transistor, which we introduced 1995. It is able to circumvent the low resistance dilemma by its direct mean free path dependence in the output. In the spin valve transistor a spin-valve multilayer serves as a base region of an n-silicon metal base transistor structure: via an emitter barrier hot electrons are injected into the spin-valve, a <b>collector</b> <b>barrier</b> accepts only non-scattered electrons by means of its angle and energy selectivity. Since the number of collected electrons depends exponentially on the spin dependent mean free path in the spin-valve base, and since the mean free path changes with field due to the perpendicular spin-valve effect, the collector current change with magnetic field is much larger than the resistance change in current-in-plane measurements and can be effectively used for magnetic field detection. Since the electron energy of the injected electrons can be varied either using different Schottky barriers or bias variation using a tunnel emitter, the spin-valve transistor allows electron spectroscopy to be performed in spin-valves. Because the electron energy range is of the same order as the spin-split 3 d bands of the ferromagnetic metals Co, Fe and Ni, a direct investigation of the spin-dependent band structure which causes the spin-valve effect is possible. An extension of the two channel model has been formulated, showing that the collector current change can be extremely large, for example, implementation of a 5 % spin-valve (measured in plane) may lead to practically useful output current variations of more than 500 %. Moreover, thickness variation e. g. using wedges, allows determination of spin dependent mean free paths...|$|E

Clinical examination revealed that the mandible was edentulous bilaterally from the first molar to the second molar region.

A horizontal osteotomy of the edentulous mandibular bone was then made with a piezoelectric device after tunnel technique of the soft tissue. The segmental mandibular sandwich osteotomy (SMSO) was finished by two (mesial and distal) slightly divergent vertical osteotomies.

40|$|Spin {{electronics}} is a {{new research}} area, which not only uses the electron’s charge but also its spin. By using the electron spin dependent properties of magnetic materials one can make devices with a new functionality. This has lead to magnetoresistive devices that can change their resistance by 10 to 50 % in small magnetic fields, such as giant magnetoresistance (GMR) devices and the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). This large resistance change {{can be used in}} applications such as read heads or serve as memory elements in a magnetic random access memory (MRAM). This thesis describes two devices: the spin-valve transistor (SVT) and the magnetic tunnel transistor (MTT). The SVT has an unique property, namely its huge relative collector current change of more than 300 % in small magnetic fields at room temperature. This unique property by itself is not enough to warrant the applicability of the SVT. The other properties that are important for the applicability of the SVT are described in this thesis. An alternative to the SVT, the MTT, will also be discussed. The SVT is a hybrid device that generally has an n-Si/ Pt / Ni 82 Fe 18 / Au/ Co/ Au/ n-Si structure. The Pt / Ni 82 Fe 18 / Au/ Co/ Au multi layer is the base and the two semiconductors on each side are the emitter and the collector respectively. The SVT is used in the common base configuration, where the emitter barrier (Si/Pt) is forward biased and the collector diode is zero or reversed biased. A flow of electrons from the silicon over the Schottky barrier into the metal base starts when the emitter is forward biased. These electrons have an excess energy compared to the Fermi level of the base and move {{in the direction of the}} collector. The electrons that are scattered in the base will lose their energy or momentum and make up the base current. Only those electrons that reach the collector with the right momentum and a high enough energy can enter the collector. The collector current is thus extremely sensitive to the scattering conditions in the base. The scattering conditions in the Ni 82 Fe 18 and the Co layer are different for the spin-up and spin-down electrons. This makes the total scattering dependent on the relative magnetizations of the Ni 82 Fe 18 and the Co layer. The collector current is largest when the magnetizations are parallel (I P C) and smallest when the magnetizations are anti-parallel aligned (I AP C). The relative change in collector current is called the magnetocurrent (MC = (I P C - I AP C) /I AP C). This PhD research started with the development of a reliable process for fabricating spin-valve transistors. The introduction of this process together with the introduction of an ultra-high vacuum metal-evaporation system and the right choice of materials resulted in the SVT’s that exhibit an MC of more than 300 % at room temperature. This thesis starts with a study on the size dependence of the magnetic and electrical properties of the SVT. We extended the previously mentioned process by using silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers, a combination of dry and wet etching techniques and SU 8 (a negative tone photoresist) as an insulator layer. We were successful in producing SVTs with lateral dimensions that ranged from 300 µm by 300 µm to 10 µm by 10 µm. As expected, we saw no influence of the dimensions on the Schottky barrier height. Moreover the reverse current scaled down linearly with area. Both observations show that we have high-quality Schottky diodes. The key property of the SVT, its MC, showed no size dependence and remained constant around 240 % for all dimensions. The transfer ratio is the ratio between the applied emitter current and the measured collector current. This ratio showed a slight decrease for transistors with dimensions below 25 µm by 25 µm. This is attributed to a deterioration of the emitter efficiency. The maximum possible emitter current decreases with transistor dimensions. The limiting factor is the maximum possible current density in the spin-valve base, which is 1. 7 × 10 7 A/cm 2. This value agrees with electromigration failure of spin valves. We have shown that it is possible to scale the lateral dimensions of the SVT down to 10 µm by 10 µm. In my view further scaling down is limited to the physical height needed for the emitter, which includes the depletion width for the Schottky barrier and the doping profile needed for the Ohmic contact. To characterize the noise sources of the SVT we studied the frequency spectrum of three types of transistors that differed only in the type of metal base. The measurement showed that the frequency spectrum of the transistor with only non-magnetic layers in the base was completely dominated by shot noise in the frequency range of the measurement (10 Hz to 100 kHz). The inclusion of one or more magnetic layers lowered the collector current and thus the level of the shot noise. It did not however change the nature of the noise or add noise (of magnetic origin) to the collector current. The collector current spectral density (SI) changes linearly with IC in a quasi-static magnetic field as expected for shot noise. We have however not observed 1 /f noise in our measurements, not even at the switching fields of the spin valve. With this knowledge we can calculate the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the SVT. The SNR increases with increasing MC and also with the absolute value collector current. From the basic relation IC = α IE we see that we can increase the collector current by either increasing the emitter current (IE) or the transfer ratio (alpha). We saw before that the emitter current has an upper limit imposed by device breakdown, therefore the way to enlarge IC is to improve the transfer ratio. We started to improve α by enlarging the energy difference between the emitter and <b>collector</b> <b>barrier.</b> The transfer ratio increased with increasing energy difference due to the larger number of states available at the collector semiconductor when electrons arrive with a higher energy. The transfer ratio also improves when materials with longer attenuation lengths are used in the base, i. e. Au instead of Pt. The influence of the SVT’s structural quality on the transfer ratio is demonstrated by the optimum in collector current versus Pt layer thickness. Furthermore, by varying the thickness of the NiFe layer we were able to prove that there is a maximum in the absolute current change for a certain thickness, due to the trade-off between transfer ratio and MC. The same study yielded a value for the attenuation of an interface, which is a factor of 0. 55. The influence of crystal orientation on the transfer ratio was found to be negligible. Temperature effects on the transfer ratio are weak and are due to the spatial distribution of Schottky barrier heights and thermal spin wave scattering. Summarizing, we improved the transfer ratio by a factor of 118 from a Si/Pt/NiFe/Au/Co/Pt/Si SVT compared with a Si/Au/NiFe/Au/Co/Cu/Si transistor, while the MC remained constant above 200 % and showed only small and non-systematic changes. The latter implies that the collection of both the spin-up and spin-down electrons can be improved, resulting in an increase in collector current without affecting the MC. The best results so far for SVTs are with a Si/ Au (20 Å) / Ni 82 Fe 18 (30 Å) / Au (70 Å) / Co (30 Å) / Au (40 Å) / Si SVT, it has a transfer ratio of 1. 2 × 10 4 and an MC of 230 %. Further improvement of the transfer ratio might result from better control over the quality of the complete SVT structure. Another option is to use a tunnel barrier on the emitter side. This not only allows one to further enlarge the energy difference between the injected electrons and the collector Schottky barrier, but also opens up the possibility to remove layers from the base if a ferromagnetic emitter electrode is used, as in an MTT. Magnetic tunnel transistors have been successfully realized with the use of in situ shadow mask technology. Already we achieved a transfer ratio equal to that of SVTs, while the MCof the MTT is above 100 %. The MTT has a Si/ Co/ Al 2 O 3 / CoFe/ IrMn/ Ta structure. We have shown that the MTT can be used to determine a lower limit for the tunnel spin polarization of a ferromagnet/insulator interface. With a MTT this lower limit can be determined in a large temperature and tunnel-barrier bias range. The transfer ratio measured versus tunnel-barrier bias continues to increase, due to the larger number of available states at the collector at higher energies. More research is needed to explain the tunnelbarrier bias dependence of the MC. We expect that MTTs can be improved by using evaporation techniques rather than sputter techniques. Furthermore the quality of the collector diode can be improved with a corresponding increase in transfer ratio by choosing the right materials. The comparison of the SVT and MTT with tunnel junctions in terms of signal, noise, scalability, frequency response, robustness and of course the ability to study the properties of spin-polarized hot-electrons in magnetic materials justifies the further research of SVTs and MTTs.

We find that when elastic scattering is significant, the true attenuation lengths are markedly larger than those predicted in a one-directional model from the scattering parameters for elastic and inelastic scattering.

The binding energy of the trapped electron {{is estimated to be}} about 1. 7 meV, which is also found to increase with the magnetic field. A simple analytic model considering the interfacial electron trapping and releasing is proposed to explain the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|The Multi Stage Collector (MSC™) {{concept for}} ultra-fine {{particulate}} control offers significant improvements over current state-of-the-art technology. The new MSC ™ design provides a synergistic {{combination of both}} single- and two-stage electrostatic precipitation while incorporating an additional collector-stage by filtering the gas exiting the <b>collector</b> through a <b>barrier</b> collector-zone. This arrangement ensures that essentially all dust would be detained in this final stage. The MSC ™ contains multiple narrow and wide zones formed by parallel corrugated plates. Enclosed in the narrow zones are discharge electrodes. These electrodes provide a non-uniform electric field leading to corona discharge. The corona discharge causes particulate matter in the gas flow to become charged. Wide regions contain barrier filters thus creating the two-stage precipitator with relatively uniform electric field. In these regions, particles are collected on both plates and on the porous barrier elements, which also act as the final filtering stage. Results of the applications analyses and future development work are discussed. The gas flow analyses with an aid of the CFD model are presented below...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} Brownian motion on {{particle}} interactions with heterogeneous collectors are evaluated by adding stochastic Brownian displacements to the particle trajectories and comparing those trajectories to those where Brownian motion is not included. We define adhesion thresholds {{as the average}} patch density on the collector required to adhere colloidal particles and Péclet numbers that quantify {{the relative importance of}} colloidal, shear and Brownian effects. We show that Brownian motion has a negligible influence on particle trajectories over collectors patterned with nano-scale heterogeneity, the non-uniform distribution of which creates locally attractive and repulsive areas within the <b>collector.</b> High energy <b>barriers</b> in strong locally repulsive areas cannot be overcome by Brownian motion, such that particle deposition on patchy collectors is controlled by spatially varying DLVO interactions and not by Brownian motion. The overall adhesive behavior of the system remains unaffected by the introduction of Brownian motion effects in the simulations, and therefore, for particle sizes that are usually used in experiments of particle trajectories over nanoscale heterogeneous collectors, it is reasonable to neglect Brownian motion effects entirely.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the {{technological}} advances observed in solar collector materials, namely better spectrally selective absorber coatings and ultra clear glass covers, contribute to performance improvements and translate into higher operational temperature ranges with higher efficiency values. While the use of Evacuated Tube Collectors (ETCs) is becoming widespread in the thermal conversion of solar energy, non-evacuated solar collectors still hold advantages at manufacturing, reliability and/or cost levels, making them interesting and competitive for a large range of applications, in particularly, in temperature ranges up to 80 °C. However, these advantages have not prevented the major drawback of these collectors when compared to ETCs: thermal losses due to internal convection which prevent their general use {{in the range of}} operating temperatures up to 150 °C. Insulation, double glazing or selective coatings can be used in non-evacuated collectors to reduce heat losses. To prevent internal convection losses in these solar collectors, different control strategies have been studied, such as the adoption of different inert gases within the <b>collector</b> cavity, physical <b>barriers</b> reducing air flow velocities over the absorber or cover surfaces or the use of concentration. In the present article, an assessment of adopting such internal convection control strategies in a CPC collector is presented. Each of the presented strategies is assessed in terms of the resulting collector optical and thermal characterization parameters and yearly collector yield. For this purpose, an integrated tool allowing the design, optical and thermal characterization of CPC collectors was developed. The results obtained provide valuable guidelines for anyone wishing to implement any of these strategies in a new collector design...|$|R
40|$|In {{semiconductor}} spintronics, silicon attracts great attention due to {{the long}} electron spin lifetime. Silicon {{is also one of}} the most commonly used semiconductor in microelectronics industry. The spin relaxation process of diamond crystal structure such as silicon is dominant by Elliot-Yafet mechanism. Yafet shows that intravalley scattering process is dominant. The conduction electron spin lifetime measured by electron spin resonance measurement and electronic measurement using ballistic hot electron method well agrees with Yafet's theory. However, the recent theory predicts a strong contribution of intervalley scattering process such as f-process in silicon. The conduction band minimum is close the Brillouin zone edge, X point which causes strong spin mixing at the conduction band. A recent experiment of electric field-induced hot electron spin relaxation also shows the strong effect of f-process in silicon. In uniaxially strained silicon along crystal axis [100], the suppression of f-process is predicted which leads to enhance electron spin lifetime. By inducing a change in crystal structure due to uniaxial strain, the six fold degeneracy becomes two fold degeneracy, which is valley splitting. As the valley splitting increases, intervalley scattering is reduced. A recent theory predicts 4 times longer electron spin lifetime in 0. 5 % uniaxially strained silicon. In this thesis, we demonstrate ballistic hot electron injection into silicon under various uniaxial strain. Spin polarized hot electron injection under strain is experimentally one of the most challenging part to measure conduction electron spin lifetime in silicon. Hot electron injection adopts tunnel junction which is a thin oxide layer between two conducting materials. Tunnel barrier, which is an oxide layer, is only 4 ∼ 5 nm thick. Also, two conducting materials are only tens of nanometer. Therefore, under high pressure to apply 0. 5 % strain on silicon, thin films on silicon substrate can be easily destroyed. In order to confirm the performance of tunnel junction, we use tunnel magnetoresistance(TMR). TMR consists of two kinds of ferromagnetic materials and an oxide layer as tunnel barrier in order to measure spin valve effect. Using silicon as a <b>collector</b> with Schottky <b>barrier</b> interface between metal and silicon, ballistic hot spin polarized electron injection into silicon is demonstrated. We also observed change of coercive field and magnetoresistance due to modification of local states in ferromagnetic materials and surface states at the interface between metal and silicon due to strain...|$|R
