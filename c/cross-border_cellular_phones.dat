Features like Bluetooth, USB, high resolution cameras, microphones, Internet, 802. 11 wireless, and memory cards are added every year. Also, the communication technology a <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> uses such as CDMA, GSM, 3 G, and 4 G are rapidly changing. To {{get a good}} grasp on what is available today letâ€™s {{take a close look}} at some off the shelf <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> detectors. Most detectors are manufactured with the intent that the <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> is stationary and powered on.

These companies produce the wolfhound cellphone detector and Cellbuster respectively. This study examines detecting <b>cellular</b> <b>phones</b> when a person is entering a secure facility or <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> restricted area. The detection technique studied requires measuring a cell phone's electromagnetic properties and determining an identifiable signature.

Eby, Kostyniuk, & Vivoda 1 The {{main purpose of}} the present study was to explore the relationship between <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> and safety belt use. Safety belt use rates of drivers using and drivers not using hand-held <b>cellular</b> <b>phones</b> were compared. All safety belt and hand-held <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> use data were collected through direct observation while vehicles were stopped at intersections and freeway exit ramps in Michigan. Data were weighted to be representative of drivers during daylight hours in Michigan. Analyses included statistical comparisons of safety belt use rates and a logistic regression model to determine the effect of hand-held <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> use on safety belt use. The study found that safety belt use for drivers using a hand-held <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> was significantly lower than for drivers not using <b>cellular</b> <b>phones.</b> This same significant relationship was found within nearly all demographic categories analyzed. The logistic regression model showed that the odds of a hand-held <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> user not using a safety belt was 1. 77 times that of a driver not using a <b>cellular</b> <b>phone.</b> These results stress the importance of the public health issue posed by <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> use; not only are those who are conversing on <b>cellular</b> <b>phones</b> potentially more likely to be in a motor vehicle crash, they are also more likely to sustain greater injury due to the lack of safety belt use...|$|R

Additionally, the conventional methods do not show sufficient performance to tolerate heavy accesses from <b>cellular</b> <b>phones.</b> We therefore design a new session management mechanism that enables <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> to use Web client-server system efficiently. To do so, we decide to utilize key concepts in the CDS mechanism, which was previously developed by us in order to implement session management on the Web. By utilizing the CDS mechanism, we develop a new session management mechanism that connects <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> and Web systems. Then, we can actually implement the session management with high safety and reliability.

In this research, we examined the influence on driving performance of <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> use on a course that simulated streets. Driving conditions were driving only, listening to the car radio, hands-free <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> use and using a <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> with the left hand. Driving performance measurements included braking response time to the brake lights of a preceding car, eye movement, distance from the vehicle in front and lane observance. The subjects were 50 drivers, including ten driving instructors. The mean glance duration when manipulating a <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> was longer than when manipulating a hands-free set or car stereo. Braking reaction delay time increased in the following order: driving only, car radio, hands-free and, longest of all, <b>cellular</b> <b>phone.</b> When the <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> was used, car speed was slowest, and {{the distance from the}} vehicle in front became the longest. Glance duration other than to the front, indicating divided attention, was shortest during the <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> use and there were also fewer instances of eye movement. In the case of <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> use, stable driving appeared to be more difficult, as there was substantial steering wheel deflection. In this experiment, it was confirmed that use of a hands-free set is effective to some extent, but driving performance was poorer than with driving only.

40|$|Abstract Background Hospital-associated {{infections are}} an {{increasing}} cause of {{morbidity and mortality}} in veterinary patients. With the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, these infections can be particularly difficult to eradicate. Sources of hospital-associated infections can include the patients own flora, medical staff and inanimate hospital objects. <b>Cellular</b> <b>phones</b> are becoming an invaluable feature of communication within hospitals, and since they are frequently handled by healthcare personnel, there may be a potential for contamination with various pathogens. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of contamination of <b>cellular</b> <b>phones</b> (hospital issued and personal) carried by personnel at the Ontario Veterinary College Health Sciences Centre with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Results MRSP was isolated from 1. 6 % (2 / 123) and MRSA was isolated from 0. 8 % (1 / 123) of <b>cellular</b> <b>phones.</b> Only 21. 9 % (27 / 123) of participants in the study indicated that they routinely cleaned their <b>cellular</b> <b>phone.</b> Conclusions <b>Cellular</b> <b>phones</b> in a veterinary teaching hospital can harbour MRSP and MRSA, two opportunistic pathogens of significant concern. While the contamination rate was low, <b>cellular</b> <b>phones</b> could represent a potential source for infection of patients as well as infection of veterinary personnel and other people that might have contact with them. Regardless of the low incidence of contamination of <b>cellular</b> <b>phones</b> found in this study, a disinfection protocol for hospital-issued and personal <b>cellular</b> <b>phones</b> used in veterinary teaching hospitals should be in place to reduce the potential of cross-contamination. </p...|$|R
40|$|All {{mobile phone}} {{subscribers}} must pay a subscription fee {{to enjoy the}} convenience of this technology. Subscribers pay for the actual time spent talking on the <b>cellular</b> <b>phone.</b> Generally, {{there are two kinds}} of billing. With prepaid service, the subscriber buys a prepaid card and pays for the <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> service in advance. As the subscriber uses airtime the <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> account is debited the appropriate amount of <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> service used. When the subscriber runs out of dollars in the <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> account, they can no longer call until the account is prepaid for additional <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> service or airtime. With postpaid service, cellular carriers bill customers based on how many minutes of airtime they use each month. When the customer places a call on an activated <b>cellular</b> <b>phone,</b> each minute the phone is connected is counted. Cellular carriers bill the customer on a monthly basis for the airtime used. There are some issues worth discussing such as fairness, non-repudiation, and non-usurpation. In this paper we propose a fair and secure mobile billing system. We introduce the "observer" concept to supervise billing to make it more objective and accepted by both cellular carriers and subscribers. The proposed scheme can detect illegal phone calls in real time and the subscriber cannot deny the deserved fees. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

We believe that there is a great potential in P 2 P filesharing applications for <b>cellular</b> <b>phones.</b> The application, MOBster, is built on top of Sunâ€™s Peer-to-Peer platform called JXTA. JXTA for Java 2 Micro Edition (J 2 ME) is a JXTA version targeted to limited devices such as <b>cellular</b> <b>phones.</b> Using a relay server in a stationary network, even less capable devices running J 2 ME, can participate in a P 2 P network consisting of both mobile and desktop devices. The application enables <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> users located anywhere in the world to share files through the JXTA network. Studies and tests shows that there are still too many constraints on <b>cellular</b> <b>phones</b> and in <b>cellular</b> environments to see any practical use of MOBster. However, the application has given us valuable information and revealed the main conditions that have to be fulfilled for such an application to become a success.

We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the effect of <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> use on the risk of brain tumor development. Methods We searched the literature using MEDLINE to locate case-control studies on <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> use and brain tumors. Odds ratios (ORs) for overall effect and stratified ORs associated with specific brain tumors, long-term use, and analog/digital phones were calculated for each study using its original data. A pooled estimator of each OR was then calculated using a random-effects model. Results Nine case-control studies containing 5, 259 cases of primary brain tumors and 12, 074 controls were included. All studies reported ORs according to brain tumor sub-types, and five provided ORs on patients with â€¡ 10 years of follow up. Pooled analysis showed an overall OR of 0. 90 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 81 â€“ 0. 99) for <b>cellular</b> <b>phone</b> use and brain tumor development.
