25|$|The {{conception}} that {{an action}} for conversion lies only for tangible property {{capable of being}} identified and taken into actual possession {{is based on a}} fiction by which the action of trover was founded, namely, that the defendant had found the property of another, which was lost. This conception has become, in the progress of the law, something without meaning which has been discarded by most courts. Therefore, it has been generally accepted that an action for conversion lies for every species of personal property which is the subject of private ownership, whether animate or inanimate. Intangible property can be the subject of a conversion in the United States. There cannot be an action in conversion for <b>choses</b> <b>in</b> <b>action</b> or mere debt.

50|$|In English law {{and some}} Commonwealth legal systems, items of {{tangible}} property {{are referred to}} as <b>choses</b> <b>in</b> possession (or a chose in possession in the singular). However, some property, despite being physical in nature, is classified in many legal systems as intangible property rather than tangible property because the rights associated with the physical item are of far greater significance than the physical properties. Principally, these are documentary intangibles. For example, a promissory note is a piece of paper that can be touched, but the real significance is not the physical paper, but the legal rights which the paper confers, and hence the promissory note is defined by the legal debt rather than the physical attributes.|$|R

50|$|Six {{types of}} {{property}} {{are not eligible}} for a like-kind exchange: (1) stock in trade or other property held primarily for sale; (2) stock, bonds, or notes; (3) other securities or evidences of indebtedness or interest; (4) interests in a partnership; (5) certificates of trust or beneficial interests; and (6) <b>choses</b> <b>in</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{consequence}} was that, {{with these}} and certain statutory exceptions (e.g., actions on policies of insurance), an action on an assigned {{chose in action}} must have been brought at law {{in the name of}} the assignor, though the sum recovered belonged in equity to the assignee. All <b>choses</b> <b>in</b> <b>action</b> being in equity assignable, except those altogether incapable of being assigned, in equity the assignee might have sued in his own name, making the assignor a party as co-plaintiff or as defendant. The Judicature Acts made the distinction between legal and equitable <b>choses</b> <b>in</b> <b>action</b> of no importance. The Judicature Act of 1873, s. 25 (6), enacted that the legal right to a debt or other legal chose in action could be passed by absolute assignment in writing under the hand of the assignor. This was later updated by the Law of Property Act 1925 s136.|$|E

50|$|Intangible property, {{also known}} as incorporeal property, {{describes}} something which a person or corporation can have ownership of and can transfer ownership to another person or corporation, but has no physical substance, for example brand identity or knowledge/intellectual property. It generally refers to statutory creations such as copyright, trademarks, or patents. It excludes tangible property like real property (land, buildings, and fixtures) and personal property (ships, automobiles, tools, etc.). In some jurisdictions intangible property {{are referred to as}} <b>choses</b> <b>in</b> <b>action.</b> Intangible property is used in distinction to tangible property. It is useful to note that there are two forms of intangible property: legal intangible property (which is discussed here) and competitive intangible property (which is the source from which legal intangible property is created but cannot be owned, extinguished, or transferred). Competitive intangible property disobeys the intellectual property test of voluntary extinguishment and therefore results in the sources that create intellectual property (knowledge in its source form, collaboration, process-engagement, etc.) escaping quantification.|$|E

40|$|Abstract   The aim of {{this study}} was to reach a deeper {{understanding}} of how social workers and police officers collaborate and what perceptions they have of young victims of crime and their needs. The study is based on a qualitative approach consisting of three group interviews and four individual interviews with police officers and social workers from the social service’s victim support center, Stödcentrum. The study's empirical data has been analyzed by using Danermark’s collaboration theory and social constructivism and has been discussed in relation to previous research. The results showed that social workers and police officers generally have a positive attitude towards collaboration with each other. The respondents felt that engaged managers, co-location and personal relationships had a positive impact on collaboration. Insufficient routines, employee turnover, privacy laws and limited insight contribute to negative experiences. It also emerged that, while both groups had shared perceptions of victims of crime, the police <b>chosed</b> <b>in</b> their response to distinguish between the roles of victims and perpetrator in their contact. ...|$|R
