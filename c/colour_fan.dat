The data suggest or indicate; In the first experiment, supplementary TPA at the 0. 15 percent and 0. 3 percent level appeared to result in little effect on egg yolk color and xanthophyll levels when added to the diet containing the pond scum meal, but after maximum yolk pigmentation were produced they tended to improve the pigmentation of yolk color and the higher level of TPA tended to increase slightly the pigmentation of egg yolk. In the second experiment, TPA added to the diet conaining the yellow corn as the sole source of pigments had no significant effect on egg yolk pigmentation at each level.

40|$|Author abstract]Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of the naturally decreasing day-lengths during the fall months on egg yolk colour and serum xanthophyll content in laying hens. Two years old White Leghorn hens were used in these experiments. They were kept in uncontrolled environment which consisted of individual laying cages without artificial light and were fed a commercial all-mash laying ration as a basal diet. All eggs that were broken out were scored using Roche yolk <b>colour</b> <b>fan</b> and the serum xanthophyll content was determined by the method of Wilson. A declines in egg production and feed consumption were observed as the fall months went by, and then egg production paused steadily almost to the end of the experimental period. It was observed during this period that hens which lay at a heigh rate of production deposit fewer xanthophyll in the blood serum than hens lay at a low rate. About pause in laying the yolk colours were still different but the depth decreased somewhat, while the serum xanthophyll content increased relatively at high level. The great increase in serum xanthophyll content was when the hens paused in laying. This increase occurred because of dietary xanthophyll that could not be deposited in the egg yolk.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the effect of {{turmeric}} rhizome powder (TRP) on performance and carcass characteristics of broiler chickens, an in vivo experiment was conducted. A corn- soybean meal based diet containing levels of TRP (0. 00, 0. 25, 0. 50 and 0. 75 %) was used. In a completely randomized design with four treatments of five replicates each, and 10 chickens per replicate, 200, Ross male broiler chickens from 0 - 49 days were studied. For performance, feed intake and body weight gain recorded weekly. For carcass characteristics, {{at the end of}} experiment at 49 days of age, one chicken from each replicate of treatments were weighed, slaughtered and the relative weight of liver, pancreas, spleen, heart and abdominal fat pad measured. By Roche <b>colour</b> <b>fan,</b> skin colour was also measured. In all weeks the amounts of feed intake, weight gain and feed to gain ratio in broilers fed treatments were not significantly different. Addition of TRP into the diets significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased relative abdominal fat pad and heart weights to live body weight. Under the conditions of this experiment, it was concluded that TRP may improve carcass quality and leaner meat would be predictable. Use of TRP as a reducing heart weight factor, may show some improve in circulatory and respiratory systems that needs to be clarified...|$|E

40|$|To achieve {{desirable}} {{egg yolk}} colour producers enhance laying hen’s diet with pigments, usually from synthetic origin. More recently, consumers {{have become more}} concerned about the use of synthetic additives in foods and feeds and interest in natural alternatives has increased. In Croatia, corn grain is the base of laying hen’s diet, but contribution of corn carotenoids to egg yolk colour was neglected. Therefore, aim of this research was to explore the pigmentation effi ciency of corn grain hybrids in egg production. Three cages, each with three laying hens were allotted to one of the eight dietary treatments differentiated only in corn hybrid (56 % of diets) and fed for 63 days. There were no added synthetic pigments in the treatments. Total carotenoid content of the corn grain and egg yolk was quantifi ed spectrophotometrically as β-carotene equivalents, while colour measurements of egg yolk were recorded instrumentally using a Minolta Chromameter (CR- 410) in the CIE L* a* b* space, and subjectively by Roche yolk <b>colour</b> <b>fan</b> (RYCF). The level of total carotenoids in corn grain ranged from 17. 32 to 31. 52 mg/kg. Total carotenoids in egg yolks signifi cantly differ (P 10) could be achieved with higher portion of corn grain in the diet. In addition, the CIE a* value correlated well with RYCF scale and therefore could be used for more objective colour measurements of egg yolk...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effects of Sanliurfa Pepper (SP) and Tomato Paste (TP) on live weight change, feed intake, feed efficiency, egg qualities and egg yolk pigmentation in quails. One hundred and eighty Japanese quails, 15 weeks of age were randomly divided into three groups; one control and two experimental groups, comprising five replicates of 12 birds each. Two diets each contained SP or TP and a control diet. All products were added at a rate of 0. 1 %. Visual assessment of yolk <b>colour</b> (Roche color <b>fan)</b> showed a stabilized yolk color of 9. 80, 13. 33 and 10. 8 for the control, SP and TP treatments, respectively (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Currently {{gluten-free}} beer is {{not produced}} in Hungary for coeliacs. The goal {{of our research}} was to develop brewery products made of domestically grown millet (Alföldi 1) and buckwheat (Oberon) {{that are similar to}} traditional beer of barley malt regarding taste, aroma, consistency, colour, foam stability and alcohol content. On a micromalting equipment malts were made of buckwheat and millet. Beer was produced on pilot plant scale (50 l) with decoction process (mashing program with rests at 50 °C, 65 °C and 72 °C) and was supplemented with a highly heat-stable bacterial α-amylase, a fungal α-amylase and β-glucanase. Malts were evaluated by congress mashing (extract content, extract difference, pH, and colour); wort and final beer analyses were performed as well (pH, extract, iodine test, <b>FAN,</b> <b>colour,</b> bitterness, alcohol and extract content). Finally, sensory characterization was carried out. Difficulties with lautering were encountered during the brewing process with buckwheat. The analytical results indicated that the buckwheat and millet beer had different values compared with a typical barley beer with regard to pH, FAN, fermentability, and total alcohol. The extracts of the buckwheat and millet wort were lower, resulting in a final attenuation of 61. 5 % and 73. 2 %. In laboratory experiments optimal temperature of β-amylase found in domestically grown buckwheat (64 °C) and millet (62 °C) was determined by detecting maltose production with HPLC. Data was used to set the rest temperature of the enzyme during mashing. Inhibiting effect of certain substances on proteolytic enzymes was investigated by measuring the extract, FAN, and soluble nitrogen contents. Inhibition was detected in case of both raw materials, although to a different extent. Inhibition is influenced by tannins and polyphenols found in the grain (Chethan et al., 2008) ...|$|R
