They <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> by asking questions directly to international students from various countries. Some local schools may request specific topics for volunteers to present about their country, especially if the students are learning it in class.

The content and depth of presentations depends on whether volunteers will be presenting to elementary, middle school or high school students or adults. Usually presentations will also include an activity for children to get involved such as learning a dance, song, game or several words and phrases in the language.|$|E

Buzz marketing comes under the channel method and is another way in which celebrities can create a ‘buzz marketing' effect and get people talking about a product. Many marketers are focusing on creating viral buzz {{to spread the word}} about their brand by using online techniques (Belch, G. E., & Belch, M. A, 2012).

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades {{anthropology}} has seen a surge in studies that focus on practices and ideologies associated with what may be described as a global middle class, or the global middle classes. We have learned about the rise of lavish weddings, interior design consultations, fashion shows, and entrepreneurial activities of various kinds. The wide-ranging institutions seemingly beloved to middle-class citizens across the globe – be it marriage, the nuclear family, education, multinational employment, etc. – are reflected in media discourses and increasingly in scholarly work, highlighting the lifestyles of those who are relatively affluent inside and beyond academia. But whilst practices ranging from the celebration of Valentine’s Day in India to private clinics providing in vitro fertilization in Egypt, or from “eating out” in urban China to investing in an apartment in Istanbul may be seen as recognizable markers of a shared global middle-class culture, the topic of the middle class remains problematic in anthropology. Interestingly, while more and more communities and individuals around the world adopt the discourse and practices of being ‘middle-class’, anthropologists continue to struggle with work addressed both to class in general and to the middle class in particular. But if class has remained a contested notion for anthropologists and other social scientists (Waquant 1992, Kalb 2015), the ethnography of middle-class lifestyles is booming. Even where class per se is not acknowledged as the focus of analysis, a whole host of issues related to middle-class life are being explored. As such it seems appropriate to find some common denominators in the analysis of the middle class, especially where claims of being middle-class (or not) and aspirations of becoming middle-class are shared amongst those with whom we do research. Not only are terms of identification intimately linked to questions of identity, we <b>can</b> also <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> from looking more closely at what ethnographies of the middle class contribute to the wider analysis of social inequality around the world...|$|R

40|$|The {{publication}} of this compendium marks {{the fifth anniversary}} of the foundation of the Institute for Family Studies in Austria. In 1994 this initiative was taken in Austria at the occasion of the International Year of the Family. The Institute serves as the focal point and facilitator of a broad array of research projects that follow different disciplinary paradigms in studying one phenomenon: the changing structures of the most intimate relationships and living arrangements in a modern post-industrial society. These are of paramount importance to individual wellbeing {{as well as to the}} future of society and this is why the inter-disciplinary analysis of this key issue deserves increased attention. We <b>can</b> also <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> from experiences and studies undertaken elsewhere. Since Austria is not an isolated island, changing family patterns can only be analysed successfully in an international perspective. In pursuit of this goal, the Austrian Institute for Family Studies recently also took on the co-ordination of the European Observatory on Family Matters which is funded by the European Commission. The present compendium is a modest attempt to inform an international audience about the research findings from Austria. It contains two introductory statements on the institutional development of family studies in Austria and the role of science in advising policy, as well as seven scientific articles. These reviewed articles present a sample of research on family related issues presently conducted in Austria. Ranging from history to biology and from qualitative sociology to statistics and simulation they provide a flashlight of the colour and diversity of present family studies in Austria. They are published either in German or English with abstracts and figure/table headings in both languages. This part is followed by a report of the main activities of the Austrian Institute for Family Studies throughout its first five years of existence and a set of tables and graphs giving some key statistics of changing family patterns in Austria...|$|R
40|$|Summary BRCA 1 / 2 {{mutations}} are {{the most}} commonlyidentified germ line gene mutations in patients with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). The BRCA genes have plethora of critical cellular functions, including repair of DNA double-strand breaks, explainingthe susceptibility for tumor development at young age and clustered in families seen the autosomal dominant inheritance. Over the years, knowledge about these genes and their function is steadily growing. Integration of this information in daily clinical practice permits a better follow-up of this group of patients. However, still many questions remain unresolved and continuing research in this topic remains compulsory. In this doctoral thesis, based on a database of nearly 1800 patients (982 HBOC families) tested at the University Hospital Leuven, {{we tried to get}} more insight in some topics with clinical relevance in this wide field concerning BRCA related tumors. Because of the broad population specific mutation spectrum of these genes, we were interested in the mutations identified at our center. We were able to list the most frequently present mutations and demonstrated that some of them were quite specific for our Belgian population andpotentially founder mutations. Moreover, collecting all clinical available data of these tested patients, permitted to look for the pathologic features of these tumors and their clinical presentation. The data made us believe in a certain genotype/phenotype correlation. If confirmed in larger studies, this can help us in the future in better counseling our patients. Collection of breast and ovarian tissue retrieved at preventive surgery offered the opportunity to perform further investigations of precursor lesions. This precursor lesions <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> us <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about the pathogenesis and behavior of the tumors, which could be reflected than again to our clinical practice. Besides collection of preventively removed specimens, availability of tumor samples from these BRCA patients also permits histologic and molecular analysis. Indeed, performing array analysis from sporadic andBRCA 1 related ovarian cancer tissues, allowed us to investigate and compare the pathways involved in the pathogenesis of these tumors. Thosepathways are the cornerstone in the development of new (target) therapies and can help in the decision on treatment strategies in function of the presence/absence of a BRCA mutation. In conclusion, in this doctoral thesis we investigated on BRCA related tumors at 3 different levels. Firstly we aimed to describe the mutations presenting in our population and correlated clinical data to these genetic information. In a second part we evaluated preventive strategiesand presence of precursor lesions in order to optimize our counseling and treatment options. In the last part, a molecular study was performed aiming the identification of distinct pathways in these BRCA related tumors compared to the sporadic ones. These 3 parts howevermerge into one another and all contributed to a better counseling, preventive and therapeutic approach of our BRCA related patients in daily clinical practice. status: publishe...|$|R
