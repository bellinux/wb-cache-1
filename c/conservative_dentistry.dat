40|$|Acid erosive tooth wear is {{increasingly}} being reported in many western countries, {{and is also}} being recognised as a significant cause of tooth destruction in persons with xerostomia. The primary aetiology is related to a high consumption of dietary sources of acids and also to an increasing awareness of gastric acid as {{a significant factor in}} both children and adults. Recommended preventive dental treatments aim to neutralise the effects of acids, reduce the severity of xerostomia, stimulate salivary flow and buffering capacity, and increase the acid resistance of tooth substance. Initial restorative treatments should be <b>conservative,</b> using adhesive <b>dentistry</b> techniques. This treatment approach is illustrated by the oral rehabilitation of a severe erosion case using adhesive onlays, veneers and all ceramic crowns...|$|R
40|$|<b>Conservative</b> and {{reconstructive}} <b>dentistry</b> saw {{a constant}} evolution, becoming a reliable technique of oral rehabilitation aiming to maintain, {{as much as}} possible, the remaining teeth in the oral cavity. The resorption of tooth's surrounding support tissues (cortical-cancellous bone and PDL) reduces its capability to efficiently support current functional loadings, determining a failure in time. In this study 3 D finite element analysis is used for studying the level and distribution of von Mises equivalent stress in the components of a human lower premolar tooth and its surrounding support tissues(bone and PDL), in case of their progressive reduction. Von Mises stress distribution indicated that a rapid and massive increase of stress values in all model's components, {{is closely related to}} the resorption process. Mechanical stress reaches highest values in bone. Additionally, {{a turning point in the}} biomechanical behavior of the support tissues can be observed at 70 % resorption degree...|$|R
40|$|We thank Drs. Carmen Rodriguez and Charles Theillet (INSERM, Montpellier) for {{providing}} tissue samples and Dr. Angel Zaballos (CNB, Madrid) {{for his help}} with the quantitative PCR reaction. Using cell lines and primary cells, {{it has been shown}} that translation control plays a key role regulating gene expression during physiological and pathological conditions. The relevance of this type of regulation in vivo (tissues, organs) remains to be elucidated, due to the lack of an efficient method for polysome-bound fractionation of solid tissue RNA samples. A simple and efficient method is described, in which tissue samples were pulverized in liquid nitrogen and lysed with NP 40 -lysis buffer in the presence of the RNAse inhibitors RNAsin and vanadyl-ribonucleoside complex. After cell lysis, the cytoplasmic extract was loaded into sucrose gradients, fractionated, and RNA prepared from each fraction. The obtained RNA was reverse transcribed with a low efficiency, a problem that was overcome by purifying polyA+ RNA. Aiming to use small quantities of solid tissue samples (10 – 20 mg/sample), polyA+ RNA purification was discarded, and the different components were individually screened for a negative effect on reverse transcription. The polysaccharide heparin, which is present as a nonspecific RNAse inhibitor, inhibits reverse transcriptase activity, and must be removed from RNA samples for an efficient reaction. Heparin was successfully removed by precipitation of the RNA with lithium chloride, as demonstrated by the reversal of the inhibition on RT-PCR reactions. In summary, we present a reliable method allowing us to prepare high-quality polysome-bound mRNA from small quantities of liquid-nitrogen–frozen solid tissue samples from both human and mouse origin, amenable for Northern blotting, RT-PCR reactions, and expression profiling analyses.

40|$|The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) {{operates}} the largest, integrated {{health care system}} in the United States of America. The projected need for long-term-care in the VA health care system parallels an expected increase in need for care in the United States, but precedes the need for care in the general population by 25 - 30 yr. The VA 2 ̆ 7 s Office of Dentistry, in an effort to estimate the resource requirements of this swelling group of veterans, initiated in 1986 - 7 an oral health survey of long-term care patients. The overall goals were to describe the oral health status of VA nursing home care units (NHCU) residents and to develop a methodology for estimating future dental health services utilization. This study describes the oral health status of the study population. Demographic and oral health data were collected for 650 long-term care residents of six VA NHCUs between October 1986 and July 1987. Data were collected on sociodemographic status, medical history, dental caries, periodontal diseases, oral soft tissue pathology, and the presence of dental prostheses. Caries and periodontal disease were evaluated using the United States National Institute of Dental Research Survey of Employed Adults and Seniors protocols. The oral health status of the population is described using DMF and ESI indices, the prevalence of oral lesions, levels of tooth loss, oral hygiene scores, and the status of existing dentures. Findings show moderate levels of untreated dental caries and periodontal disease and significant tooth loss which increased with age. A need for preventive therapy, restorative <b>dentistry,</b> <b>conservative</b> periodontal therapy, and prosthodontic care was evident...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To assess {{trends in}} hygiene {{management}} in dental practices {{in comparison to}} an earlier survey in 2002 / 2003 and to point out key aspects for future efforts. Method: The infection prevention management of all dental practices in Greifswald (n= 35) was determined by a questionnaire in a personal interview in 2008 / 2009. Results: 26 % of the dentists did not use sufficient personal protective equipment during the general examination of the patient. In <b>conservative</b> and prosthetic <b>dentistry,</b> 15 % still did not use adequate measures and 9 % did not even in surgical interventions. Vaccination coverage was clearly too low, as only 35 % of dentists were vaccinated against influenza and coverage with other vaccinations was also quite low. 11 % of the dentists did not perform a documented anamnesis and in 29 % of the dental practices no appointment system for risk patients existed. There were significant deficiencies in the reprocessing of medical devices and in the equipment needed for reprocessing. The {{opportunity to participate in}} further training in this field was rejected by 23 % of the dentists. In 10 dental practices, the colony count in the dental unit water-conducting system was five times higher than the limit. A contamination with P. aeruginosa was discovered in 4 practices. All units were renovated. Discussion: Overall, both the hygiene management and hygiene equipment in the practices have improved considerably compared to the previous survey in 2002 / 2003. This demonstrates the positive effect of the KRINKO guidelines from 2006. However, the survey again showed relevant deficiences in the hygiene management of dental practices, which agrees with a Germany-wide online survey from 2009. Conclusion: While the study revealed persistent deficiencies in hygiene management, especially in reprocessing, it confirms that the KRINKO guidelines for dental practices from 2006 led to significant improvements in hygiene management. Doubts {{about the impact of the}} guidelines are not backed by evidence...|$|R
40|$|This study {{grew from}} {{a request for}} {{information}} as to the date of establishment of the Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) as the professional qualification for dentists in the United Kingdom. In the process of answering this enquiry {{it became apparent that}} there was no simple answer and that university dental education was not covered by the existing literature. It also became clear that, while ubiquitous for new dentists by the late twentieth century, the dental degree had only comparatively recently become the standard path to a dental career. This study emphasises the role of professional education, and particularly university education and research, {{in the development of the}} dental profession and dental services. University dental education and research, it is argued, was a major factor in the professionalisation of dentistry, in convincing the government of the importance of dental health and thus in establishing dentistry as an essential part of the National Health Service (NHS). University dental education and research, it is argued, extended the therapeutic potential of dental treatment, promoted understanding of the relationship between oral and systemic disease, of the etiology and pathology of dental disease and of methods of prevention and control. Such was the impact of the new standards thus established, that the whole emphasis of dental treatment would shift within the space of one hundred years, from dental surgery and dental prosthetics to <b>conservative</b> and preventive <b>dentistry.</b> This study shows that, from the mid-nineteenth century, a dental elite campaigned for compulsory professional education and, from the late nineteenth century, for university dental education. By the beginning of the twentieth century professional education for doctors and surgeons, for the degree of MBChB, was carried out in university medical schools. Yet, although the dental curriculum was based on the surgical curriculum, it was not until the mid-twentieth century that the standards pioneered by the dental elite were extended to the majority of candidates for the dental profession. Indeed, the generally low standards which prevailed prior to the retiral of the generation of unqualified "Dentists, 1921 " had damaging effects on the oral and general health of the British population. The study also suggests that the dearth of qualified dentists contributed to the delay in achieving legislation to eliminate unqualified practice. Arguably, the low standards of the majority of dentists also contributed to the delay in persuading the government that dental treatment was as important to the health and well-being of the population as any other aspect of health care. Just as the standards advanced by the dental elite ultimately persuaded the government of the relative importance of dental care. This study therefore examines the factors which delayed the achievement of a consistent and high standard of professional dental education for dental practitioners. In so doing the study identifies several factors which contributed to the lack of demand for professional dental education and qualification and thus delayed dentistry's establishment as a graduate profession...|$|R
