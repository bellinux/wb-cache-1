5|$|Graham Norton himself {{went on to}} parody the {{incident}} in his own show by placing a similar banner {{at the bottom of}} the screen and having a Dalek exterminate his own cartoon <b>caricature.</b>|$|E
5|$|A minor {{controversy}} about the trophy occurred in 1984, when Donald Wandrei refused his Life Achievement award {{as he felt}} the award bust was a demeaning <b>caricature</b> of Lovecraft, whom he had known personally. Wandrei's rejected trophy was later recycled and given to another award winner.|$|E
5|$|Imelda Staunton voiced the Tall Flower Faces. Though {{there are}} many flowers that appear around Underland, {{only one of them}} speaks {{and one of them is}} clearly a <b>caricature</b> of Staunton. Staunton only speaks three lines that are heard very briefly at the {{beginning}} of the film.|$|E
50|$|<b>Caricatures</b> can be {{insulting}} or complimentary and {{can serve}} a political purpose or be drawn solely for entertainment. <b>Caricatures</b> of politicians {{are commonly used}} in editorial cartoons, while <b>caricatures</b> of movie stars are often found in entertainment magazines.|$|R

50|$|There {{have been}} some efforts to produce <b>caricatures</b> {{automatically}} or semi-automatically using computer graphics techniques. For example, a system proposed by Akleman et al. provides warping tools specifically designed toward rapidly producing <b>caricatures.</b> There are very few software programs designed specifically for automatically creating <b>caricatures.</b>|$|R
5|$|Nixon's {{career was}} {{frequently}} dogged by his persona and the public's perception of it. Editorial cartoonists and comedians often exaggerated his appearance and mannerisms, {{to the point}} where the line between the human and the <b>caricature</b> became increasingly blurred. He was often portrayed with unshaven jowls, slumped shoulders, and a furrowed, sweaty brow.|$|E
5|$|Operation Clambake {{was founded}} in 1996 by Andreas Heldal-Lund, an {{information}} technology manager in Stavanger, Norway, who administers the site at www.xenu.net. This domain name {{has been described as}} provocative, because it is seen by some as a <b>caricature</b> of the character Xenu from Scientology cosmogony. Operation Clambake is registered in Norway as a non-profit organization.|$|E
5|$|Thunderbird 6, {{a sequel}} film shot {{simultaneously}} with Captain Scarlet, stars puppets intended to compromise {{between the first}} and second generations. Although the heads and hands remained large in relation to the torso and legs, the sculptors reduced the explicit <b>caricature</b> evident in the Thunderbirds television episodes and Thunderbirds Are Go to leave puppets sized in intermediate proportions.|$|E
50|$|Hollitzer {{was also}} known for his fine <b>caricatures.</b> He <b>caricatured</b> {{some of the most}} famous people from his time like Gustav Klimt, Karl Kraus, Hermann Bahr, Egon Friedell and Peter Altenberg. Many originals of his <b>caricatures</b> are in the Albertina, Vienna. Many long {{forgotten}} and until this day unpublished scripts, notes and <b>caricatures</b> {{are in the hands of}} a collector from Vienna. The last exhibition took place in 2001 in the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere.|$|R

5000|$|... "Basically, {{an honest}} man who just didn't realize the immensity {{of what he was}} up against. In a way, I'm {{sympathetic}} to him despite his mistakes because he was so easily <b>caricatured,</b> and I've seen myself <b>caricatured.</b> And if I were a more important figure, I'd be <b>caricatured</b> in history books, too." [...] - on his hero, Senator Joseph McCarthy.|$|R
5|$|As {{was common}} in Victorian drama, a woman (Maggie Brennan) played {{a young man}} (Peter). The play's script assigns {{dialogue}} to three numbered villagers in the opening scene. The named character of Jacques has no more lines than any of these and disappears after {{the first page of}} the script. Righton, who first played Boomblehardt, portrayed him as a Jewish <b>caricature.</b> Gilbert's script did not use a Jewish dialect, and historian Jane Stedman suggests that Righton's increasingly broad portrayal and interpolations show that Gilbert had little control of Righton's portrayal of the part.|$|E
5|$|Cresswell {{occupied}} a rare position in seventeenth-century England, {{as a person}} of common birth who rose {{to a position of}} high status as an independently wealthy, unmarried woman running a substantial business enterprise. She figures in a wide assortment of contemporary literature and songs, in ballads, poems, broadsides, novels and party pamphlets, often portrayed as a <b>caricature</b> of vice, a satirical figure of street commentary, sexual theatre and political bawdry.|$|E
5|$|During {{the scene}} where the Commandant is talking, there is a brief shot of Lisa blinking. As {{there had been an}} error in the final print of the episode, the shot was animated, painted and shot on May 16, 1997, the Friday before the episode's airdate. The spiky blond-haired boy, who runs towards the Eliminator while screaming, is a <b>caricature</b> of {{director}} Mike B. Anderson.|$|E
5000|$|Van de Venne {{specialised}} in <b>caricatures</b> {{of so-called}} ‘low-life’ subjects, such as card-players, tooth-pullers and musicians, and in expressive religious scenes. [...] His paintings demonstrate harsh <b>caricatures</b> in a stronger light than Adriaen Brouwer.|$|R
5000|$|Love Bites: <b>Caricatures</b> by James Gillray: An {{exhibition}} in 2015 {{to mark the}} 200th anniversary {{of the death of}} British caricaturist James Gillray (1757-1815). The <b>caricatures</b> on display will be from the collection of New College, Oxford.|$|R
50|$|Džumhur {{published}} his first <b>caricatures</b> in an army magazine in 1947, and very soon {{became one of}} the most prominent illustrators in Yugoslavia, publishing his <b>caricatures</b> in the country's best selling newspapers and magazines, such as Politika, Borba, Oslobođenje, Jež, NIN, Danas and many others. He published over 10,000 illustrations and <b>caricatures,</b> wrote numerous screenplays and worked on the TV show Hodoljublje, which he hosted for over ten years on Sarajevo television.|$|R
5|$|Individual {{school districts}} have responded to {{complaints}} by local Native American individuals and tribes, or have made changes due to an increased awareness of the issue among educators and students. New Native mascots have not been proposed in recent decades, or are withdrawn before becoming official due to public opposition. For example, in 2016 {{when one of the}} teams in the National College Prospects Hockey League (NCPHL) was announced as the Lake Erie Warriors with a <b>caricature</b> Mohawk logo it was immediate changed to the Lake Erie Eagles.|$|E
5|$|Ingres' {{portrait}} of Bertin {{was a critical}} and popular success, but the sitter was a private person. Although his family worried about <b>caricature</b> and disapproved, it became widely known and sealed the artist's reputation. It was praised at the Paris Salon of 1833, and has been influential to both academic painters such as Léon Bonnat and later modernists including Pablo Picasso and Félix Vallotton. Today art critics regard it as Ingres' finest male portrait. It has been on permanent display at the Musée du Louvre since 1897.|$|E
5|$|Literary critic Ioana Pârvulescu {{agreed that}} there was a link between Mitică and other {{characters}} in Caragiale's sketches; she subsequently argued that formed {{an integral part of the}} writer's <b>caricature</b> of Romania in its entirety, and that the measure to which they reflected reality is impossible to detect. In her 2007 volume of essays, titled În Ţara Miticilor. De şapte ori Caragiale ("In the Land of the Mitici. Seven Times Caragiale"), she stressed that the character was both more human and more artificial than his usual interpretations in 20th century commentary.|$|E
50|$|His Rapallo <b>caricatures</b> {{were mostly}} of late Victorian and Edwardian political, {{literary}} and theatrical personalities. The court of Edward VII {{had a special}} place as a subject for affectionate ridicule. Many of Beerbohm's later <b>caricatures</b> were of himself.|$|R
50|$|In Pettoruti's youth, {{while he}} was {{discovering}} his potential artistic talent, he worked on drawings and <b>caricatures</b> of people. He created several <b>caricatures,</b> enough to show forty-six at the exhibition hall of the local newspaper in Buenos Aires.|$|R
50|$|Gard {{continued}} to draw <b>caricatures</b> {{in exchange for}} meals until his death, ultimately creating more than 700 pictures. Today, the <b>caricatures</b> are housed in the Billy Rose Theatre Division of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.|$|R
5|$|Riley's chief legacy was his {{influence}} in fostering {{the creation of}} a midwestern cultural identity and his contributions to the Golden Age of Indiana Literature. Along with other writers of his era, he helped create a <b>caricature</b> of midwesterners and formed a literary community that produced works rivaling the established eastern literati. There are many memorials dedicated to Riley, including the James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{was incorporated into}} the Star Wars merchandising campaign that corresponded with the theatrical release of Return of the Jedi. Besides the films, Jabba the Hutt is featured in Star Wars Legends literature. Jabba the Hutt's image has since played an influential role in popular culture, particularly in the United States. The name {{is used as a}} satirical literary device and a political <b>caricature</b> to underscore negative qualities such as morbid obesity and corruption.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{sequence}} where {{soccer is}} portrayed as the most boring sport imaginable was intended to show that soccer was more boring on television than live, but both Michels and Groening enjoy the game. The referee at the game is a <b>caricature</b> of the janitor at Film Roman, who supplied director Pete Michels with every piece of soccer information he needed to design the episode. Pelé also makes an appearance at the match, although he is voiced by Hank Azaria.|$|E
