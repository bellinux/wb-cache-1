40|$|Five internationally used <b>current</b> <b>bibliographies</b> {{are here}} {{compared}} {{with respect to}} their coverage of the periodical literature, the degree of their overlapping, and three basic aspects of their layout (list of analyzed periodicals, arrangement of references, index construction). As regards coverage, the most striking conclusion is the low to minimal rate of overlapping, so that it would be rather risky for the student to rely on one bibliography only, even the most extensive. Coverage, of course, is not the sole factor in assessing the value of a bibliography. The five bibliographies differ widely in their organisation and are by far not equally easy to use...|$|R

Since 1969, the Critical Bibliography was published as the fifth issue to a volume. In 1989, the name was changed to Isis <b>Current</b> <b>Bibliography</b> to reflect that, since Sarton’s retirement in 1953, the bibliography had not been truly critical in the sense that each citation was commented on by an expert. It then also became a separate publication from Isis. It includes citations to publications in the history of science and related fields, including books, book reviews, journal articles and more. The bibliography is the oldest and largest bibliography in the field, going back to the first issue of Isis in 1913.

40|$|The essay {{provides}} a status report on Argentina’s non-existent official and <b>current</b> national <b>bibliography.</b> It {{includes the following}} discussions: a brief explanation of the theoretical context, {{an analysis of the}} legislation in force, a presentation of the national bibliographic products compiled in the past and reference to the only current substitute available. The essay also looks at two interesting, but thwarted projects, as well as four proposals made between 1985 and 1986.

What circumstances could have conspired to enable us to reach the 21 st century, without even glimpsing the beginnings of an attempt to resolve the matter?
