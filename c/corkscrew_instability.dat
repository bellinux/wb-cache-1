We have tried this with the results shown in Figs. IV- 1 and IV- 2. Several commercial high-pressure Fig. IV- 1. Apparatus for exhibiting a very bright high-pressure mercury arc. The image on the wall is for the arc in zero magnetic field. (IV. NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE) Fig. IV- 2. Spiral shape assumed by the arc {{in the presence of}} an axial magnetic field of- 50 gauss. mercury arcs have been used. In Fig. IV- 1 the arc is inside of a metal chimney along the axis of a pair of Helmholtz coils. A large lens focuses an image of the arc on a wall. As the field is turned on, the arc shows a tendency to spiral. Around 50 gauss it is usually steady, as in Fig. IV-Z, but at higher fields the spiral rotates faster and faster. Under certain conditions the spiral may bob up and down without rotating. The details of the motion seem to be associated with conditions at the electrodes. F. Bitte...|$|E
40|$|The {{accelerator}} on the second-axis of the Dual-Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test (DARHT-II) facility [1] {{will generate}} a 20 MeV, 2 - 4 kA, 2 m s long electron beam with an energy variation £ – 0. 5 %. Four short current pulses with various lengths {{will be selected}} out of this 2 m s long current pulse and delivered to an x-ray converter target. The DARHT-II radiographic resolution requires these electron pulses to be focused to sub-millimeter spots on Bremsstrahlung targets with peak-to-peak transverse beam motion less than a few hundred microns. We have modeled the transverse beam motion, including the beam breakup <b>instability,</b> <b>corkscrew</b> motion [2, 3], transverse resistive wall instability [4] and beam induced transverse deflection in the kicker system, from the DARHT-II injector exit to the x-ray converter target. Simulations show that the transverse motion at the x-ray converters satisfies the DARHT-II radiographic requirements. ...|$|R
