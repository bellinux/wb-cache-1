500|$|The European Commission also {{specified}} a euro logo with exact proportions and foreground {{and background}} colour tones. While the Commission intended the logo to be a prescribed glyph shape, font designers {{made it clear}} that they intended to design their own variants instead. Typewriters lacking the euro sign can create it by typing a capital 'C', backspacing and overstriking it with the equal ('=') sign. Placement of the <b>currency</b> <b>sign</b> relative to the numeric amount varies from nation to nation, but for texts in English the symbol (or the ISO-standard [...] "EUR") should precede the amount.|$|E

2500|$|In the 18th century, {{the mark}} was {{generally}} known in English as the [...] "oblique". The variant [...] "oblique stroke" [...] eventually developed into [...] "stroke", the common British {{name for the}} mark. In the 19th and early 20th century, it was also widely known as the [...] "shilling mark" [...] or [...] "solidus", from its use as the <b>currency</b> <b>sign</b> for the shilling. The name [...] "slash" [...] is a recent development, first attested in American English , but has gained wide currency through its use in computing, a context where it is sometimes even used in British English in preference to the usual name [...] "stroke". Clarifying terms such as [...] "forward slash" [...] have been coined owing to widespread use of Microsoft's DOS and Windows operating systems, which use the backslash extensively.|$|E
2500|$|The euro <b>currency</b> <b>sign</b> was {{designed}} to be similar in structure to the old sign for the European Currency Unit (Encoded as [...] ). There were originally thirty-two proposals; these were reduced to ten candidates. These ten were put to a [...] public survey. After the survey had narrowed the original ten proposals down to two, it was up to the European Commission to choose the final design. The other designs that were considered are not available for the public to view, nor is any information regarding the designers available for public query. The European Commission considers the process of designing to have been internal and keeps these records secret. The eventual winner was a design created by a team of four experts whose identities have not been revealed. It is assumed that the Belgian graphic designer Alain Billiet was the winner and thus the designer of the euro sign.|$|E

2500|$|The slash (as the [...] "shilling mark" [...] or [...] "solidus") was the <b>currency</b> <b>sign</b> of the shilling, {{a former}} coin of the United Kingdom and its former colonies. Before the {{decimalization}} of currency in Britain, its currency symbols (collectively £sd) represented their Latin names, {{derived from a}} medieval French modification of the late Roman libra, solidus, and denarius. Thus, one penny less than two pounds was written [...] During the period when English orthography included the long s , the s. (that is, ſ.) came to be written as a single slash. When the d. fell out of general use, one penny less than two pounds was written [...] Similarly, [...] "2/6" [...] meant two shillings sixpence.
