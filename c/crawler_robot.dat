40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the path planning {{problem of a}} mobile sensor, which is a micro <b>Crawler</b> <b>robot</b> equipped with a Eddy Current probe, for aircraft rivet inspection. Due to the specific movement characteristic of the <b>Crawler</b> <b>robot,</b> the path, or the rivet sequence should enable the <b>Crawler</b> <b>robot</b> to realize the localization-and-reposition process. Therefore a final path {{is subject to the}} following three requirements: i) the distance between any two consecutive rivets on the path should be less than a threshold distance; ii) the number of turns should be minimized and iii) the overall distance should be minimized. In this paper, a novel algorithm is developed to generate the required path. This algorithm first identifies the minimum set of line segments partitioning all the rivets and then connects the line segments to minimize the overall distance.

30|$|How {{to improve}} task {{performance}} {{and how to}} control a robot in extreme environments when just a few sensors {{can be used to}} obtain environmental information are two of the problems for disaster response robots (DRRs). Compared with conventional DRRs, multi-arm multi-flipper <b>crawler</b> type <b>robot</b> (MAMFR) have high mobility and task-execution capabilities. Because, <b>crawler</b> <b>robots</b> and quadruped robots have complementary advantages in locomotion, therefore we have the vision to combine both of these advantages in MAMFR. Usually, MAMFR (like four-arm four-flipper robot OCTOPUS) was designed for working in extreme environments such as that with heavy smoke and fog. Therefore it is a quite necessary requirement that DRR should have the ability to work in the situation even if vision and laser sensors are not available. To maximize terrains adaption ability, self-balancing capability, and obstacle getting over capability in unstructured disaster site, as well as reduce the difficulty of robot control, we proposed a semi-autonomous control system to realize this compound locomotion method for MAMFRs. In this control strategy, robot can explore the terrain and obtain basic information about the surrounding by its structure and internal sensors, such as encoder and inertial measurement unit. Except that control system also can recognize the relative positional relationship between robot and surrounding environment through its arms and <b>crawlers</b> state when <b>robot</b> moving. Because the control rules is simple but effective, and each part can adjust its own state automatically according to robot state and explored terrain, MRMFRs have better terrain adaptability and stability. Experimental results with a virtual reality simulator indicated that the designed control system significantly improved stability and mobility of robot in tasks, it also indicated that robot can adapt complex terrain when controlled by designed control system.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a remote control}} system for a crawler-type mobile robot with passive sub-crawlers. This system has a great advantage because it utilizes an essential compliant mechanism that allows {{the angle of the}} sub-crawlers to be adapted to the shape of the road surface. Its operation is extremely simple, and it is only necessary to control the movement direction and driving speed in comparison with the case of controlling active sub-crawlers. However, a robot with passive sub-crawlers cannot recover from a situation in which it is stuck. The operator must select a traversable route for unknown rough terrain using only the information obtained from camera images and some sensor data from the robot. In this study, a remote control system for a <b>crawler</b> <b>robot</b> with passive sub-crawlers was developed based on a warning system. This system evaluates the currently selected route by calculating the stabilization for the robot when falling down in the roll and pitch directions. Experimental results obtained using a prototype <b>crawler</b> <b>robot</b> with passive sub-crawlers demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed system.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a warning system, not a {{semi-autonomous}} control system, for a remote-controlled disaster response robot, because the operator {{should have the}} authority to make the final decision in order to realize flexible operation at all times. By evaluating the stability margin, a remote control system for a <b>crawler</b> <b>robot</b> with passive sub-crawlers is proposed that adopts the warning system with a dynamic threshold. The current route selected by the operator is evaluated by calculating the stabilization for the robot while falling down in the roll and pitch directions. An operator can prevent the robot from falling down based on the sound and signals from the warning system when the evaluation value for the stability margin is less than the threshold. The proposed system will be able to prompt the operator to select another route. A method of compensating for the disadvantages of a <b>crawler</b> <b>robot</b> with passive sub-crawlers will be proposed in this paper. This paper describes a method for evaluating the potential for falling down by using a predictive falling down margin time based on the normalized energy (NE) stability margin. The results of experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed system.|$|E

30|$|Remote-controlled mobile robots {{are useful}} for searching around and inside {{buildings}} that have collapsed in a disaster. In a disaster area, to avoid the risk of secondary disasters, it is preferable to immediately deploy remote-controlled mobile robots {{instead of waiting for}} first responders such as firefighters. Disaster response robots should have high mobility on rough terrain. The movement mechanism of a crawler-type robot with sub-crawlers has been applied to many disaster response robots in order to realize high mobility [1]. However, its use complicates robot operation because the operator must actively control each sub-crawler by estimating the attitude or state of the robot based on camera images and sensor information. Therefore, because of the multiple degrees of freedom involved, operators must be well trained to achieve high mobility by using remote control. A semi-autonomous control system for crawler robots has been studied to realize both high mobility and simple operation [2],[3]. This study focused on a <b>crawler</b> <b>robot</b> with passive sub-crawlers to realize simple operation with multiple degrees of freedom. Passive sub-crawlers can adapt to unknown rough terrain. We developed a crawler-type mobile robot for conducting search operations around a disaster area. Passive sub-crawlers called “Scotta I” were adopted for this robot. In a <b>crawler</b> <b>robot</b> with passive sub-crawlers, it is only necessary to control the movement direction and driving speed, unlike in the case of controlling active sub-crawlers. However, posture control is impossible in passive sub-crawlers because the operator cannot actively control each sub-crawler, and a robot with passive sub-crawlers cannot recover from a situation in which it is stuck. A robot with passive sub-crawlers is extremely simple, but it is essential for the operator to possess considerable skill when selecting a route. The operator must select a traversable route for unknown rough terrain using only the information obtained from camera images and sensor data from the robot.|$|E

Hence, such robots {{will be used in}} a various scenarios including structured or unstructured environments, flat or rough terrain, indoor or outdoor, and narrow spaces. Recently, wheel-based and crawler robots have been widely used given their high-mobility mechanisms [3]. A wheel-based robot generally has limitations in locomotion over rough terrain. A <b>crawler</b> <b>robot</b> has no such limitation, however, its mechanism has another problem in stability when applied in different types of terrain. On the other hand, legged robots have been proposed as a general solution for any type of terrain [4 – 6].

For expert operators, it would be best for the system to provide only assistance. On the other hand, because of their lack of skill, beginner operators cannot react quickly enough to prevent the robot from falling down. Hence, in order to support a beginner operator, we {{think that it would be}} best for the system to interrupt their actions, such as through a speed-controlled system.

Approach: Between these two extremes, it was proposed that Treasure Graph, called T-Graph is a more effective way to guide the Web crawler to fetch topic specific documents predicted by identifying the topic boundary around the unvisited link and comparing that text with all the nodes of the T-Graph to obtain the matching node(s) and calculating the distance in the form of documents to be downloaded to reach the target documents.
