6000|$|The <b>chain</b> <b>slings</b> {{came down}} faster and faster, while the hammerings of the winch rang insistently through their rattle. At any {{cost to the}} men below it must not be kept waiting. The blaze of {{brightness}} beneath the hatch became dazzling, and Austin felt his shoulders scorched as he passed through it. The iron deck above them shed down an intolerable heat, and still the olive-faced Canarios swayed, and splashed, and heaved amidst the barrels. Now and then a man said [...] "Car-rai!" [...] or in incongruous juxtaposition, [...] "Ave Maria!" [...] ejaculating it in gasps, {{but there was a}} puncheon ready when the sling came clashing down, and Jefferson's voice rang encouragingly through the din.|$|E

40|$|A cane {{harvesting}} system which eliminates {{the use of}} <b>chain</b> <b>slings</b> has been developed on Illovo's mill-cum-planter estate. A semi-mechanised "split {{harvesting system}} " has been adopted. Conventional type trailers are used for infield haulage which off-load loose cane into windrows on the loading banks. Grabloaders then transload the cane from the windrow into "Hilo " cane lorries for transportation to the Tllovo mill. Reductions in staff on the loading banks have been achieved and the running costs of the grabloaders {{are found to be}} {{similar to those of the}} conventinonal Mobamech cranes which are operated by Illovo on the growers loading banks...|$|E
25|$|On 21 August 1906 Joseph Hunter, a Greymouth wharf labourer, {{was badly}} injured working No. 2 hold. A heavy <b>chain</b> <b>sling</b> was thrown down, {{striking}} {{him on the}} head and knocking him senseless. He sustained nasty cuts on the head and face.|$|R
50|$|Most engine cranes are {{equipped}} with a telescopic boom which can be extended to reach engine blocks located further into the engine compartment. At {{the end of the}} boom there is a grab hook where lifting <b>chains,</b> <b>slings</b> or a load leveler can be attached for lifting purposes.|$|R
2500|$|On 13 April 1987, a Hiller 12E {{helicopter}} {{was being used}} for the installation of a rotating beacon atop the control tower, then under construction. The beacon {{was attached to the}} helicopter for lifting by a <b>chain</b> <b>sling.</b> After the beacon had been lifted into place, workers disconnected the <b>chain</b> <b>sling</b> from it. As the {{helicopter was}} departing, The hook on the sling became snagged on the tower guard rail... causing it to pitch nose down and roll to the right. With the cable being tensioned by the pull of the helicopter the hook freed itself [...] towards the helicopter. The cable flew up around the tail boom and became entangled in one of the main rotor blades. The other main rotor blade severed the tail boom which fell free of the helicopter striking the side of the tower {{on its way to the}} ground. The major section of the helicopter then fell to the ground at the base of the tower, caught fire and was burnt out.The accident resulted in the death of the helicopter pilot. The subsequent investigation conducted by the Australian Transport Safety Board, found that the pilot's licence was not endorsed for sling loading operations and he was not sufficiently current on the aircraft type... to undertake such a job.|$|R
40|$|Rig Check was {{developed}} by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in partnership with safety experts from the oil and gas extraction industry. It is made up of 35 inspection forms. The forms are designed to be used by rig workers to document the inspection of tools and equipment commonly found on rotary and workover rigs. Each inspection form includes instructions for assessing and recording the condition of the equipment. When applicable, relevant federal regulations and industry recommended practices are included. The Rig Check inspection forms are an excellent training tool for short service employees, who may not be familiar with the tools and equipment found on oil and gas rigs. Small companies whose safety and health resources are limited may find Rig Check useful for enhancing their HSE programs. The forms can also be downloaded from the NIOSH website at: www. cdc. gov/niosh/programs/oilgas/products. html. Rig Check Monthly Inspection Forms: [...] Emergency Response: [...] 1.

60|$|Presently {{he looked}} about. Lights were opening out in {{twinkling}} lines as the steamer moved shoreward, and {{a splash of}} oars {{came out of the}} gloom. Dick vacantly noted that several boats were approaching, and then a winch rattled and Don Sebastian, who had come up quietly, touched his arm. A <b>chain</b> <b>sling</b> swung past beneath a moving derrick, and as they crossed the deck {{to get out of the}} way he saw a steamer close by. Her windlass was clanking as she shortened her cable and he supposed she was the Spanish boat the mate had spoken of, but he followed his companion and listened to what he had to say. Then as the anchor was let go he thought Jake ought to have come back and went to look for him. He found the lad leaning against the deckhouse, smoking a cigarette.|$|R
50|$|A {{lewis is}} most useful {{when it is}} not {{possible}} to lift the stone with <b>chains</b> or <b>slings,</b> because of either the location or shape of the stone, or delicate projections. Examples include the closing stone in a string course, cylindrical column drums, decorated column capitals, and coping stones in a pediment. Heavy ashlar stones are also bedded using a lewis.|$|R
60|$|Then he gave Frank a {{handspike}} {{that lay}} close by, and between them they prized up {{one end of}} a log so that he could slip a <b>chain</b> <b>sling</b> under it. The other end of the chain was attached to the yoke of the oxen, and when he called them the big white and red beasts hauled the log away until he stopped them and went back for another. Frank did not find much difficulty in this, but it was different when they had drawn six or seven of the logs together and laid them side by side. Harry said that the next lot must go on top of the others, and Frank was wondering how they were to get them there, when his companion laid two or three stout skids some distance apart against the first of the row. These, it was evident, would serve as short, slanting bridges, but Frank was still not clear as to how the next log could be propelled up them.|$|R
50|$|Steam shovels {{usually had}} a three-man crew: engineer, fireman and ground man. There was much jockeying {{to do to}} move shovels: rails and timber blocks to move; cables and block {{purchases}} to attach; <b>chains</b> and <b>slings</b> to rig; and so on. On soft ground, shovels used timber mats to help steady and level the ground. The early models were not self-propelled, rather they would use the boom to manoeuvre themselves.|$|R
5000|$|Boom - use an {{adjustable}} boom with a winch to recover vehicles from a ditch, over an embankment, or any place the vehicle cannot be safely reach backing-up. Some booms are fixed, some heavy pivoting A-frames, others hydraulic-powered telescoping tubes. In the past boom trucks used a [...] "hook and chain" [...] system where chains are looped around the vehicle frame or axle, then lifted by a boom winch. A towbar with heavy rubberized mats connects {{the truck and}} vehicle, {{so it can be}} towed on its other axle. [...] "Slings" [...] and [...] "belt lifts" [...] are an evolution, with rubber straps replacing part of the <b>chains.</b> <b>Slings</b> are not used much today because they can scratch the bumpers of cars. But they are sometimes used for towing vehicles that have been in an accident or have {{one or two of the}} front or rear wheels missing or for pickup trucks and other vehicles that have steel bumpers. Cars equipped with all-wheel drive cannot be towed with a sling, since it can cause problems with the car's drivetrain.|$|R
60|$|Austin, however, {{discovered}} that he had very little time to think of Jefferson. The Spaniards were on results, too, and when the <b>chain</b> <b>sling</b> came rattling down the strenuous toil began. The hold was dim and shadowy, as well as insufferably hot, and filled with nauseating smells. The tiers of barrels slanted so that one could scarcely stand on them, but when somebody gave Austin a handspike he took his place with the rest, and set about prizing loose the puncheons {{so that they could}} get a sling round them or the hoisting-crabs on the stave-ends. Now and then the crabs slipped, or tore through the oil-soaked wood when the great barrel swung up into the sunlight, and it came crashing down; while each time they made an opening, the rest slipped down, grinding upon each other, and squeezed it up again. Those on the lower side were water-borne, but the others were only held in place by those beneath them on the incline, and the men could not keep the untouched tiers intact as they would have done had the Cumbria been floating level.|$|R
50|$|A {{lifting hook}} is a device for {{grabbing}} and lifting loads {{by means of}} a device such as a hoist or crane. A lifting hook is usually equipped with a safety latch to prevent the disengagement of the lifting wire rope <b>sling,</b> <b>chain</b> or rope to which the load is attached.|$|R
25|$|Lift {{bags are}} used to bring the load up in stages: a long <b>chain</b> or <b>sling</b> is used to connect the load to a lift bag just below the surface, which is filled to break out the load and lift it until the bag reaches the surface, then a second bag is used to bring the load up further. This {{procedure}} continues until the load has been raised sufficiently. Advantages of this method are a more controlled lift, the facility to use a larger capacity for initial breakout without risk of a runaway. Disadvantages include the requirement for divers to work {{on or near the}} lifting gear when under load.|$|R
60|$|It was for {{the purpose}} of raising the latter portion of the cargo that Baldwin and his men had been engaged by Mr Hazlit. Hitherto the divers had been {{extremely}} successful. With the usual appliances of <b>slings,</b> <b>chains,</b> shears and windlasses, etcetera, they had already recovered a large quantity of goods, and were still busy in the hold when Edgar went down.|$|R
50|$|A green {{chain is}} a type of lumber {{delivery}} system {{that can be used in}} a sawmill. The green chain's purpose is to collect the final product of the mill and move it at a controlled rate to be graded and sorted. In the 19th and early to late 20th century, the green chain was used by people. Men would stand alongside and pull lumber that matches the required dimensions and place it in piles. In short, the workers sorted the lumber. Modern sawmills use automatic systems, such as the lumber dropping through the <b>chain</b> into large <b>slings,</b> where it can be picked up and moved to a staging area to dry. Most likely called the green chain because the lumber is green and has not been seasoned.|$|R
