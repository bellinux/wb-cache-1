40|$|Large, uniform {{sized coke}} is {{desirable}} for blast furnace use. It {{has previously been}} shown that the <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> flue temperature {{in the first few}} hours of coking is a key determinant of coke size. In this paper, the authors present a new programmed heating approach, which is called pulsed heating,aiming to increase coke mean size at a given average flue temperature. The approach takes into account the charging sequence in <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>batteries</b> and the authors demonstrate how existing operating practice can be modified in batteries with suitable heating systems to achieve the desired heating programme. A mathematical model of fissure formation provides a prediction of the increase in coke mean size using pulsed heating, compared with standard heating. Pilot scale experiments have also been performed to validate the modelling approach. The results of the modelling indicate that the mean coke size can be increased by several millimetres in some cases, although results from the pilot scale show that pulsed heating increases coke size, but by a smaller amount than that predicted by the model. The potential advantages and limitations of pulsed heating are discussed, as well as opportunities for further investigation of the approach...|$|R

40|$|National audienceTo face coke {{and steel}} market requirement, the coking process {{has to be}} more flexible. But {{changing}} process parameters such as coking temperature and time, blend composition [...] . can have consequences of the <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>battery</b> lifetime and on its masonries. The main objective of this work is to determine the admissible stress for the coke oven heating walls in order to prevent cracks formation. Thus a numerical tool of the <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>battery</b> based on the Finite Element Method was developed. It is a two-step model using homogenization and submodelling techniques in order to decrease the computational cost. Coke oven masonries are large structures composed of thousands of bricks and mortar joints. In the model, bricks and mortar are replaced by a Homogeneous Equivalent Material (HEM) whose behaviour depends on the joints state. The HEM properties are determined thanks to brick-mortar interface behaviour, experimentally characterised at high temperature. In order to control joint opening, a criterion changing the HEM is used. The use of the HEM gives the global stresses instead of local stresses, that's why, a submodelling step has been developed to obtain local stresses used in the criterion and thus to have accurate information about joint opening...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 51 - 53) A correlational {{study was}} performed to evaluate four methods of monitoring occupational exposure to <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emissions. Total and respirable particulate sampling was conducted at four areas of the <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> of Kaiser Steel Corporation???s steel manufacturing facility at Fontana, California. From these particulate samples, the concentrations of coal tar pitch volatiles (CTPV) were also determined by benzene extraction. A statistical analysis was then performed on the resulting four indicators of <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> emission exposure to determine possible predictive value of any one method upon any of the others. The four methods were total particulate, total CTPV, respirable particulate, and respirable CTPV. The strengths of relationships among the four methods were expressed as the Pearson product moment coefficient of correlation (r). Respirable and total particulate, {{were found to be}} highly correlated to respirable and total CPTV, respectively. The following pairs of methods were also strongly correlated: total particulate with respirable particulate, total CPTV with respirable CPTV, and respirable particulate with total CPTV. Assuming linear relationships, regression analyses were performed under the correlation model. The distribution of personal sampling data taken from Kaiser Steele???s files differed significantly from the area samples. It was therefore concluded that any practical predictive formulas should be based on personal rather than area samples. A large difference between the correlation coefficients for total particulate and total CPTV on two different groups of <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>batteries</b> indicated that research of the factors influencing these variations would be valuable and is needed. It was determined that total CPTV would provide the best and most practical indication of the carcinogenicity of coke-oven emissions...|$|R
40|$|The {{iron and}} steel {{production}} processes are characterized by a considerable environmental impact. The reduction of this impact, in particular emissions, is the target of modem society; this goal can be achieved through process optimization. The two main production processes, the blast furnace one and the one from electric arc furnace, are of different specificities and therefore different levers are present in order to decrease the amount of pollutants in the atmosphere. The adoption of pre reduced iron charge for these processes seems to be a good operating practice. A further reduction of pollutants linked to the <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>batteries</b> can be carried out thanks to the reduction of loaded cast iron within the converter. The decrease of the hot charge means that a lower amount of coal is consequently required. The electrical cycle, due to its structure, has a lower environmental impact, but the maximization of the process yield is a desirable objective for the purpose of a reduction of the environmental impact and economic optimization of such a steel cycle. The direct-reduced iron (DRI), due to its operative flexibility, is a suitable element to achieve this target...|$|R

The iron works were set up at Hirapur, then a small village on the Asansol-Adra line. The railway station was at a neighbouring village, Narsinghbandh. It had two blast furnaces each producing around 700 tonnes per day - the first blast furnace went into operation in 1922 and the second in 1924. <b>Coke</b> <b>oven</b> <b>batteries</b> were added. In the earlier stages, bullock carts were used for transportation in the plant.

The goal of this work is to develop a thermo-chemo-mechanical model of the coal paste which emphasis the mechanical effects of the pyrolysis.

The mathematical formulation of the problem is a set of partial differential equations that combine mass balance, energy balance and state laws of each phase. The second stage concerns the change from coal to plastic phase which induces a mechanical behavior evolution of the skeleton, from elasticity to viscoplasticity.

The paper presents the attempts to determine the level of emission of PCDDs/PCDFs from the COB underfiring system and to confront the obtained results with the calculations based on the mass balance of chlorine in the coking process and reactions of both chlorophenols formation and PCDDs and PCDFs formation from mono- and polychlorophenols. There were PCDDs/PCDFs concentrations measured in flue gases from the underfiring system of two COBs at a Polish coking plant. The measurements included both an old and a new battery. The obtained concentrations of PCDDs/PCDFs were lower than reported in the literature (0. 5 - 1. 7 ng I-TEQ/tcoke), while the results for old COB were on average 3 times higher than for the new one.

40|$|Combustible waste gases are {{by-products}} of many technological processes. They vary {{in their}} calorific value and are used to decrease the usage of gases whose calorific value is higher. Coke oven gas from the coking process and process gases from an electric furnace in a copper plant are examples of such gases.

For this purpose a 3 D thermomechanical model of a heating wall {{taking into account the}} assembly of bricks and joints was developed with PRISME Laboratory. To build an efficient and complete model, different parameters must be taken into account: * complexity of the structure: heating walls include flues and are made of masonries with various types of bricks (with various shapes and materials). The presence of joints has a great influence on the wall behaviour since they can open in tension and close in compression; * brick and joint material behaviours: refractory materials have specific thermo-mechanical behaviours, temperature depending; * knowledge of thermo-mechanical loading: temperature field, weights of walls, roof and larry car, pre-stresses (anchoring system), lateral pressure due to coal pushing A 3 D heating wall model was developed and allows to take all these parameters into account. The model was created in order to estimate the maximal lateral pressure and to understand mechanism of joints opening. Moreover, the model is based on Fos sur Mer coking plant geometry, and particularly on the battery 3 which was instrumented.
