5|$|Squamous-cell {{carcinoma}} {{accounts for}} about 30% of lung cancers. They typically occur close to large airways. A hollow <b>cavity</b> <b>and</b> associated cell death are commonly found {{at the center of}} the tumor. About 9% of lung cancers are large-cell carcinoma. These are so named because the cancer cells are large, with excess cytoplasm, large nuclei and conspicuous nucleoli.|$|E

Pneumatized skulls are also found in larger proboscideans (e.g. elephants, mastodons, and other extinct relatives).|$|E
5|$|Toroids : The fossil Vendoglossa tuberculata {{from the}} Nama Group, Namibia, has been {{interpreted}} as a dorso-ventrally compressed stem-group metazoan, with a large gut <b>cavity</b> <b>and</b> a transversely ridged ectoderm.

5|$|A single large {{opening on}} either side of the back of the skull links Dimetrodon with mammals and distinguishes it from most of the {{earliest}} sauropsids, which either lack openings or have two openings. Features such as ridges on the inside of the nasal <b>cavity</b> <b>and</b> a ridge at the back of the lower jaw are thought to be part of an evolutionary progression from early tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) to mammals.|$|E
5|$|During osmoregulation, fluid {{is added}} to the pericardia of the branchial hearts. The octopus has two nephridia (equivalent to {{vertebrate}} kidneys) which are associated with the branchial hearts; these and their associated ducts connect the pericardial cavities with the mantle cavity. Before reaching the branchial heart, each branch of the vena cava expands to form renal appendages which are in direct contact with the thin-walled nephridium. The urine is first formed in the pericardial <b>cavity,</b> <b>and</b> is modified by excretion, chiefly of ammonia, and selective absorption from the renal appendages, as it is passed along the associated duct and through the nephridiopore into the mantle cavity.|$|E
5|$|Encephalopathy often occurs {{together}} with other symptoms and signs of liver failure. These may include jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and the whites of the eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal <b>cavity),</b> <b>and</b> peripheral edema (swelling of the legs due to fluid build-up in the skin). The tendon reflexes may be exaggerated, and the plantar reflex may be abnormal, namely extending rather than flexing (Babinski's sign) in severe encephalopathy. A particular smell (foetor hepaticus) may be detected.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a multipartite system {{consisting of two}} noninteracting qubits each embedded in a single-mode leaky cavity, in turn connected to an external bosonic reservoir. Initially, we take the two qubits in an entangled state while the <b>cavities</b> <b>and</b> the reservoirs have zero photons. We investigate, in this six-partite quantum system, the transfer of quantum discord from the qubits to the <b>cavities</b> <b>and</b> reservoirs. We show that this transfer also occurs when the cavities are not entangled. Moreover, we discuss how quantum discord can be extracted from the <b>cavities</b> <b>and</b> transferred to distant systems by traveling leaking photons, using the input–output theory...|$|R
5|$|Finally, the Acurad system {{employed}} a patented double shot piston design. The {{idea was to}} use a second piston (located within the primary piston) to apply pressure after the shot had partially solidified {{around the perimeter of}} the casting <b>cavity</b> <b>and</b> shot sleeve. While the system was not very effective, it did lead the manufacturer of the Acurad machines, Ube Industries, to discover that it was just as effective to apply sufficient pressure at the right time later in the cycle with the primary piston; this is indirect squeeze casting.|$|E
5|$|Fish ovaries may be {{of three}} types: gymnovarian, {{secondary}} gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the oocytes are released directly into the coelomic <b>cavity</b> <b>and</b> then enter the ostium, then through the oviduct and are eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed ova into the coelom from which they go directly into the oviduct. In the third type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the oviduct. Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in lungfish, sturgeon, and bowfin. Cystovaries characterize most teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct. Secondary gymnovaries are found in salmonids {{and a few other}} teleosts.|$|E
5|$|Immersion of {{the human}} body in water affects the circulation, renal system, fluid balance, and breathing, because the {{external}} hydrostatic pressure of the water provides support against the internal hydrostatic pressure of the blood. This causes a blood shift from the extravascular tissues of the limbs into the chest <b>cavity,</b> <b>and</b> fluid losses known as immersion diuresis compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. Hydrostatic pressure on the body from head-out immersion causes negative pressure breathing which contributes to the blood shift.|$|E

5|$|Megalodon {{probably}} {{had a profound impact}} on the structure of marine communities. The fossil record indicates that it had a cosmopolitan distribution. It probably targeted large prey, such as whales, seals, and giant turtles. Juveniles inhabited warm coastal waters where they would feed on fish and small whales. Unlike the great white which attacks prey from the soft underside, megalodon probably used its strong jaws to break through the chest <b>cavity</b> <b>and</b> puncture the heart and lungs of its prey.|$|E
5|$|Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve {{release of}} air {{flow through the}} nasal <b>cavity,</b> <b>and</b> these are called nasals or nasalized sounds. Other sounds are defined {{by the way the}} tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called laterals, because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called rhotics) that are {{characterized}} by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream.|$|E
5|$|The body wall {{consists}} of a cuticle, an epidermis and longitudinal and circular bands of muscle fibres. In some primitive species, each epidermal cell has a single cilium, a feature shared only by the gnathostomulans. The whole ventral surface of the animal may be ciliated or the cilia may be arranged in rows, patches or transverse bands. The cuticle is locally thickened in some gastrotrichs and forms scales, hooks and spines. There is no coelom (body <b>cavity)</b> <b>and</b> {{the interior of the}} animal is filled with poorly differentiated connective tissue. In the macrodasyidans, Y-shaped cells, each containing a vacuole, surround the gut and may function as a hydrostatic skeleton.|$|E

5|$|The {{middle ear}} lies between the outer ear {{and the inner}} ear. It {{consists}} of an air-filled cavity called the tympanic <b>cavity</b> <b>and</b> includes the three ossicles and their attaching ligaments; the auditory tube; and the round and oval windows. The ossicles are three small bones that function together to receive, amplify, and transmit the sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. The ossicles are the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup). The stapes is the smallest named bone in the body. The middle ear also connects to the upper throat at the nasopharynx via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube.|$|E
5|$|Unpaired males find a {{suitable}} <b>cavity</b> <b>and</b> begin to build nests {{in order to}} attract single females, often decorating the nest with ornaments such as flowers and fresh green material, which the female later disassembles upon accepting him as a mate. The amount of green material is not important, as long as some is present, but the presence of herbs in the decorative material appears to be significant in attracting a mate. The scent of plants such as yarrow acts as an olfactory attractant to females.|$|E
5|$|A single {{spotted hyena}} can eat at least 14.5kg of meat per meal. Although spotted hyenas act aggressively {{toward each other}} when feeding, they {{compete with each other}} mostly through speed of eating, rather than by {{fighting}} as lions do. When feeding on an intact carcass, spotted hyenas will first consume the meat around the loins and anal region, then open the abdominal <b>cavity</b> <b>and</b> pull out the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are consumed, the hyenas will eat the lungs and abdominal and leg muscles. Once the muscles have been eaten, the carcass is disassembled and the hyenas carry off pieces to eat in peace. Spotted hyenas are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow. A single hyena can take less than two minutes in eating a gazelle fawn, while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes. Spotted hyenas do not require much water, and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking.|$|E

50|$|Adding to a {{long history}} of {{significant}} developments, such as superconducting radio frequency <b>cavities</b> <b>and</b> pretzel orbits, the accelerator group is now developing an entirely new type of superconducting linear accelerator called the Energy Recovery Linear accelerator (ERL).

5|$|Another way {{to measure}} {{the speed of light}} is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the <b>cavity</b> <b>and</b> from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} viewed as extremophiles living in harsh environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes, {{but they have}} since been found in {{a broad range of}} habitats, including soils, oceans, and marshlands. They are also part of the human microbiota, found in the colon, oral <b>cavity,</b> <b>and</b> skin. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in plankton {{may be one of the}} most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life and may play roles in both the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle. No clear examples of archaeal pathogens or parasites are known, but they are often mutualists or commensals. One example is the methanogens that inhabit human and ruminant guts, where their vast numbers aid digestion. Methanogens are also used in biogas production and sewage treatment, and biotechnology exploits enzymes from extremophile archaea that can endure high temperatures and organic solvents.|$|E
5|$|Best {{known for}} biting neat round chunks of tissue from marine mammals and large fish, the cookiecutter shark is {{considered}} a facultative ectoparasite, as it also wholly ingests smaller prey. It has a wide gape and a very strong bite, by virtue of heavily calcified cranial and labial cartilages. With small fins and weak muscles, this ambush predator spends much of its time hovering in the water column. To maintain neutral buoyancy, its liver, which can comprise some 35% of its weight, is rich in low-density lipids. As this species has higher skeletal density than Euprotomicrus or Squaliolus, its body <b>cavity</b> <b>and</b> liver are proportionately much larger, and the oil content is much higher. Its large caudal fin allows for a quick burst of speed to catch larger, faster prey that come in range.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the quantum discord for two identical qubits in both two independent single-mode <b>cavities</b> <b>and</b> a common single-mode cavity are discussed. For the initial Bell state with correlated spins, while the entanglement sudden death can occur, the quantum discord vanishes only at discrete moments in the independent <b>cavities</b> <b>and</b> never vanishes in the common cavity. Interestingly, quantum discord and entanglement show opposite behaviors in the common cavity, unlike in the independent cavities. For the initial Bell state with anti-correlated spins, quantum discord and entanglement behave {{in the same way}} for both independent <b>cavities</b> <b>and</b> a common <b>cavity.</b> It is found that the detunnings always stabilize the quantum discord.
