40|$|Change {{detection}} scheme {{based on}} guided contrasting was previously proposed. Guided <b>contrasting</b> <b>filter</b> takes two images (test and sample) as input and forms the output as filtered version of test image. Such filter preserves the similar details and smooths the non-similar details of test image with respect to sample image. Due to this the difference between test image and its filtered version (difference map) could be a basis for robust change detection. Guided contrasting is performed in two steps: at the first step some smoothing operator (SO) is applied for elimination of test image details; at the second step all matched details are restored with local contrast proportional {{to the value of}} some local similarity coefficient (LSC). The guided <b>contrasting</b> <b>filter</b> was proposed based on local average smoothing as SO and local linear correlation as LSC. In this paper we propose and implement new set of selective guided <b>contrasting</b> <b>filters</b> based on different combinations of various SO and thresholded LSC. Linear average and Gaussian smoothing, nonlinear median filtering, morphological opening and closing are considered as SO. Local linear correlation coefficient, morphological correlation coefficient (MCC), mutual information, mean square MCC and geometrical correlation coefficients are applied as LSC. Thresholding of LSC allows operating with non-normalized LSC and enhancing the selective properties of guided contrasting filters: details are either totally recovered or not recovered at all after the smoothing. These different guided <b>contrasting</b> <b>filters</b> are tested as a part of previously proposed change detection pipeline, which contains following stages: guided <b>contrasting</b> <b>filtering</b> on image pyramid, calculation of difference map, binarization, extraction of change proposals and testing change proposals using local MCC.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} detecting high-speed incoming targets by the fusion of spatial and temporal detectors to achieve a high detection rate for an active protection system (APS). The incoming targets have different image velocities according to the target-camera geometry. Therefore, single-target detector-based approaches, such as a 1 D temporal filter, 2 D spatial filter and 3 D matched filter, cannot provide a high detection rate with moderate false alarms. The target speed variation was analyzed according to the incoming angle and target velocity. The speed of the distant target at the firing time is almost stationary and increases slowly. The speed varying targets are detected stably by fusing the spatial and temporal filters. The stationary target detector is activated by an almost zero temporal <b>contrast</b> <b>filter</b> (TCF) and identifies targets using a spatial filter called the modified mean subtraction filter (M-MSF). A small motion (sub-pixel velocity) target detector is activated by a small TCF value and finds targets using the same spatial filter. A large motion (pixel-velocity) target detector works when the TCF value is high. The final target detection is terminated by fusing the three detectors based on the threat priority. The experimental results of the various target sequences show that the proposed fusion-based target detector produces the highest detection rate with an acceptable false alarm rate...|$|E
40|$|The {{visual system}} {{processes}} natural scenes {{in a split}} second. Part {{of this process is}} the extraction of "gist," a global first impression. It is unclear, however, how the human visual system computes this information. Here, we show that, when human observers categorize global information in real-world scenes, the brain exhibits strong sensitivity to low-level summary statistics. Subjects rated a specific instance of a global scene property, naturalness, for a large set of natural scenes while EEG was recorded. For each individual scene, we derived two physiologically plausible summary statistics by spatially pooling local <b>contrast</b> <b>filter</b> outputs: contrast energy (CE), indexing contrast strength, and spatial coherence (SC), indexing scene fragmentation. We show that behavioral performance is directly related to these statistics, with naturalness rating being influenced in particular by SC. At the neural level, both statistics parametrically modulated single-trial event-related potential amplitudes during an early, transient window (100 - 150 ms), but SC continued to influence activity levels later in time (up to 250 ms). In addition, the magnitude of neural activity that discriminated between man-made versus natural ratings of individual trials was related to SC, but not CE. These results suggest that global scene information may be computed by spatial pooling of responses from early visual areas (e. g., LGN or V 1). The increased sensitivity over time to SC in particular, which reflects scene fragmentation, suggests that this statistic is actively exploited to estimate scene naturalness...|$|E

Accurate determination of {{the location of the}} centre of the pupil and processing speed are the most crucial requirements in such a real-time video-based eye-tracking system. However, occlusion of the pupil by artifacts such as eyelids, eyelashes, glints and shadows {{in the image of the}} eye and changes in the illumination conditions pose significant problems in the determination of pupil centre. Apart from robustness and accuracy, real-time eye-tracking applications demand low computational complexity as well.

40|$|A {{neural network}} model of global motion {{segmentation}} by visual cortex is described. Called the Motion Boundary Contour System (BCS), the model clarifies how ambiguous local movements on a complex moving shape are actively reorganized into a coherent global motion signal. Unlike many previous researchers, we analyse how a coherent motion signal is imparted to all regions of a moving figure, not only to regions at which unambiguous motion signals exist.

The Motion BCS describes how preprocessing of motion signals by a Motion Oriented <b>Contrast</b> <b>Filter</b> (MOC Filter) is joined to long-range cooperative grouping mechanisms in a Motion Cooperative-Competitive Loop (MOCC Loop) to control phenomena such as motion capture. The Motion BCS is computed in parallel with the Static BCS of Grossberg and Mingolla (1985 a, 1985 b, 1987). Homologous properties of the Motion BCS and the Static BCS, specialized to process movement directions and static orientations, respectively, support a unified explanation of many data about static form perception and motion form perception that have heretofore been unexplained or treated separately. Predictions about microscopic computational differences of the parallel cortical streams V 1 [...] > MT and V 1 [...] > V 2 [...] > MT are made, notably the magnocellular thick stripe and parvocellular interstripe streams.

The beam intensity has major influence on the contrast of the image in the Zernike phase contrast filtering. In 1935, Zernike proposed the phase contrast technique for converting a spatial phase modulation into a spatial intensity modulation by introducing a phase shift of 2 radian between the zero order and higher order spatial frequencies in the Fourier plane. It’s successful operation in a linear regime require that the spatial phase distribution), (yx at the input {{be limited to the}} so called small-scale phase approximation where the largest phase is typically taken to be significantly less than 3.

Smoke samples were generated using the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) and Canadian Intense (CI) machine-smoking regimens. NNN and NAT were the most abundant TSNAs in tobacco filler and smoke across all cigarette brands, whereas NNK and NAB were present in lesser amounts. The average ratios for each TSNA in mainstream smoke to filler content is 29 % by the CI smoking regimen and 13 % for the ISO machine-smoking regimen. The reliability of individual TSNAs to predict total TSNA amounts in the filler and smoke was examined. NNN, NAT, and NAB have a moderate to high correlation (R(2) = 0. 61 - 0. 98, p < 0. 0001), and all three TSNAs individually predict total TSNAs with minimal difference between measured and predicted total TSNA amounts (error < 7. 4 %). NNK has weaker correlation (R(2) = 0. 56 - 0. 82; p < 0. 0001) and is a less reliable predictor of total TSNA quantities.

This theory clarifies why parallel streams Vl-> V 2 and Vl-> MT exist for static form and motion form processing among the areas Vl, V 2, and MT of visual cortex. The Motion Boundary Contour System consists of several parallel copies, such that each copy is activated by a different range of receptive field sizes. Each copy is further subdivided into two hierarchically organized subsystems: a Motion Oriented <b>Contrast</b> <b>Filter,</b> or MOC Filter, for preprocessing moving images; and a Cooperative-Competitive Feedback Loop, or CC Loop, for generating emergent boundary segmentations of the filtered signals. The present article uses the MOC Filter to explain a variety of classical and recent data about short-range and long-range apparent motion percepts {{that have not yet}} been explained by alternative models. These data include split motion; reverse-contrast gamma motion; delta motion; visual inertia; group motion in response to a reverse-contrast Ternus display at short interstimulus intervals; speed-up of motion velocity as interfiash distance increases or flash duration decreases; dependence of the transition from element motion to group motion on stimulus duration and size; various classical dependencies between flash duration, spatial separation, interstimulus interval, and motion threshold known as Korte's Laws; and dependence of motion strength on stimulus orientation and spatial frequency. These results supplement earlier explanations by the model of apparent motion data that other models have not explained; a recent proposed solution of the global aperture problem, including explanations of motion capture and induced motion; an explanation of how parallel cortical systems for static form perception and motion form perception may develop, including a demonstration that these parallel systems are variations on a common cortical design; an explanation of why the geometries of static form and motion form differ, in particular why opposite orientations differ by 90 °, whereas opposite directions differ by 180 °, and why a cortical stream Vl -> V 2 -> MT is needed; and a summary of how the main properties of other motion perception models can be assimilated into different parts of the Motion Boundary Contour System design.
