[...] In order to photograph small villages in these mountains, Vishniac claimed he carried heavy equipment (Leica, Rolleiflex, movie camera, tripods), 115pounds (52 kilograms) by his estimate, on his back, up steep roads, trekking many miles.

2500|$|Presenting {{his first}} gallery {{exhibition}} in 1978 as an “installation” {{rather than as}} a photography show, Wall placed The Destroyed Room in the storefront window of the Nova Gallery, enclosing it in a plasterboard wall.Mimic [...] (1982) typifies Wall's cinematographic style and according to art historian Michael Fried [...] "characteristic of Wall's engagement in his art of the 1980s with social issues". A 198 × 226cm. colour transparency, it shows a white couple and an Asian man walking towards the camera. The sidewalk, flanked by parked cars and residential and light-industrial buildings, suggests a North American industrial suburb. The woman is wearing red shorts and a white top displaying her midriff; her bearded, unkempt boyfriend wears a denim vest. The Asian man is casual but well-dressed in comparison, in a collared shirt and slacks. As the couple overtake the man, the boyfriend makes an ambiguous but apparently obscene and racist gesture, holding his upraised middle finger close to the corner of his eye, [...] "slanting" [...] his eye in mockery of the Asian man's eyes. The picture resembles a <b>candid</b> <b>shot</b> that captures the moment and its implicit social tensions, but is actually a recreation of an exchange witnessed by the artist.|$|E

50|$|Most often a {{prime lens}} will be used, both because the zoom is not {{necessary}} for posed shots (and primes are lighter, cheaper, faster, and higher quality), and because zoom lenses can introduce highly unflattering geometric distortion (barrel distortion or pincushion distortion).
