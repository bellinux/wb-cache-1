5|$|Old Norse Þórr, Old English ðunor, Old High German Donar, Old Saxon thunar, and Old Frisian thuner are <b>cognates</b> {{within the}} Germanic {{language}} branch, descending from the Proto-Germanic masculine noun *þunraz 'thunder'.|$|E
5|$|The term is {{etymologically}} related to Modern English hall and therefore also Valhalla, an afterlife 'hall of the slain' in Norse Mythology. Hall and its numerous Germanic <b>cognates</b> derive from Proto-Germanic *hallō 'covered place, hall', from Proto-Indo-European *kol-.|$|E
5|$|The English {{proper name}} Sun {{developed}} from Old English sunne {{and may be}} related to south. <b>Cognates</b> to English sun appear in other Germanic languages, including Old Frisian sunne, sonne, Old Saxon sunna, Middle Dutch sonne, modern Dutch zon, Old High German sunna, modern German Sonne, Old Norse sunna, and Gothic sunnō. All Germanic terms for the Sun stem from Proto-Germanic *sunnōn.|$|E

40|$|Starting {{with the}} Transitivity Requirement {{hypothesis}} [the direct object counterpart of Extended Projection P rinciple (EPP) ], {{we examine the}} development of <b>cognate</b> objects and <b>cognate</b> subjects in English. We show that English extended the range of both <b>cognate</b> objects - which are now also possible with activity/event nouns - and <b>cognate</b> subjects - <b>cognate</b> subjects became an option for impersonal verbs. However, we argue that a correlation between the development of <b>cognate</b> arguments and the changes in null arguments should be excluded, whereas {{the development of the}} <b>cognate</b> arguments appears to be related to aspectual changes...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that in English while unergative verbs can take <b>cognate</b> objects, transitive verbs or unaccusative verbs cannot (Massam 1990). However, in Chinese, not only can intransitives take <b>cognate</b> objects, transitives can also take <b>cognate</b> objects. Furthermore, when a transitive takes a <b>cognate</b> object and another object, the two objects may be freely ordered, depending on the forms of the two objects, i. e., whether the <b>cognate</b> object is a reduplicated form of the verb and whether the other object NP is a pronoun. In this paper I examine the ordering between the <b>cognate</b> object and the other object in the double object construction. I propose a scrambling process, clitic status of the object pronoun, and lexical status of a reduplicated <b>cognate</b> object, to explain the different orderings in the double object construction. In this paper I examine <b>cognate</b> objects in Chinese. The concept of <b>cognate</b> object...|$|R
5|$|The main medieval Germanic <b>cognates</b> (words of {{a common}} origin) of elf are Old Norse alfr, plural alfar, and Old High German alp, plural alpî, elpî (alongside the {{feminine}} elbe). These words must come from Common Germanic, the ancestor-language of English, German, and the Scandinavian languages: the Common Germanic forms must have been *ɑlβi-z and ɑlβɑ-z.|$|E
5|$|The modern English word raven has <b>cognates</b> in {{all other}} Germanic languages, {{including}} Old Norse (and subsequently modern Icelandic) hrafn and Old High German (h)raban, all which descend from Proto-Germanic *khrabanas. An old Scottish word corby or corbie, akin to the French corbeau, {{has been used for}} both this bird and the carrion crow.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, {{appreciation}} of Bashō's poems grew more fervent, and commentators such as Ishiko Sekisui and Moro Nanimaru {{went to great}} length to find references in his hokku to historical events, medieval books, and other poems. These commentators were often lavish in their praise of Bashō's obscure references, {{some of which were}} probably literary false <b>cognates.</b> In 1793 Bashō was deified by the Shinto bureaucracy, and for a time criticizing his poetry was literally blasphemous.|$|E
50|$|Northwest relies {{upon the}} {{contract}} manufacturing organization <b>Cognate</b> Bioservices for services supporting manufacture of product for clinical trials. The relationship with <b>Cognate</b> is long term, having begun before 2007 and slated to extend {{through the first}} quarter of 2016. Due to cash flow issues common to development-stage companies, Northwest compensates <b>Cognate</b> through a combination of cash and stock payments. Further, <b>Cognate</b> has provided Northwest with at least one short-term loan, provided and paid in mid-2013. , Northwest is undergoing an increase in activities as a result of expanding clinical trials, which has led to increasing reliance on <b>Cognate</b> for services, and subsequent renegotiation of the agreement with <b>Cognate.</b>|$|R
50|$|In linguistics, a <b>cognate</b> object (or <b>cognate</b> accusative) is a verb's {{object that}} is {{etymologically}} {{related to the}} verb. More specifically, the verb {{is one that is}} ordinarily intransitive (lacking any object), and the <b>cognate</b> object is simply the verb's noun form. For example, in the sentence He slept a troubled sleep, sleep is the <b>cognate</b> object of the verb slept. <b>Cognate</b> objects exist in many languages, including various unrelated ones; for example, they exist in Arabic, Chichewa, German, Ancient Greek, Hebrew, Icelandic, Korean, Latin, and Russian.|$|R

We evaluate our <b>cognate</b> identification module and we compare it to other methods using pure statistical techniques. Thus, we study {{the impact of the}} used linguistic information and the orthographic adjustments on the results of the <b>cognate</b> identification module and on <b>cognate</b> alignment. Our method obtains the best results in comparison with the other implemented statistical methods. ...|$|R
5|$|The Old Norse {{feminine}} proper noun Hel {{is identical}} to the name of the location over which she rules, Old Norse Hel. The word has <b>cognates</b> in all branches of the Germanic languages, including Old English hell (and thus Modern English hell), Old Frisian helle, Old Saxon hellia, Old High German hella, and Gothic halja. All forms ultimately derive from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic feminine noun *xaljō or *haljō ('concealed place, the underworld'). In turn, the Proto-Germanic form derives from the o-grade form of the Proto-Indo-European root *kel-, *kol-: 'to cover, conceal, save'.|$|E
5|$|The Romanians' ethnogenesis {{cannot be}} {{understood}} based exclusively on written sources, because the earliest records on their ancestors {{were made by}} 11th-century Byzantine historians. When referring to the Romance-speaking population of Southeastern Europe, early medieval sources used the Vlach exonym or its <b>cognates,</b> which all derived from the Common Slavic term for speakers of the Latin language. The earliest sources write of the Vlachs of the central territories of the Balkan Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{place names}} in Scandinavia contain the Old Norse name Þórr. The {{identification}} of these place names as pointing to religious significance {{is complicated by}} the aforementioned common usage of Þórr as a personal name element. Cultic significance may only be assured in place names containing the elements -vé (signifying the location of a vé, a type of pagan Germanic shrine), –hof (a structure used for religious purposes, see heathen hofs), and –lundr (a holy grove). The place name Þórslundr is recorded with particular frequency in Denmark (and has direct <b>cognates</b> in Norse settlements in Ireland, such as Coill Tomair), whereas Þórshof appears particularly often in southern Norway. Torsö (Thor's Island) appears on the Swedish westcoast. Thor also appears in many placenames in Uppland.|$|E

5|$|The Modern English noun Valhalla {{derives from}} Old Norse Valhöll, a {{compound}} noun {{composed of two}} elements: the masculine noun valr 'the slain' and the feminine noun höll 'hall'. Valr has <b>cognates</b> in other Germanic languages such as Old English wæl 'the slain, slaughter, carnage', Old Saxon wal-dād 'murder', Old High German 'battlefield, blood bath'. All of these forms descend from the Proto-Germanic masculine noun *walaz. Among related Old Norse concepts, valr also appears as the first element of the nouns valkyrja 'chooser of the slain, valkyrie' and Valfreyja, one of the goddess Freyja's several names.|$|E
5|$|The Yaghnobi {{people living}} in the Sughd {{province}} of Tajikistan still speak a dialect of the Sogdian language. Yaghnobi is largely a continuation of the medieval Sogdian dialect from the Osrushana region of the western Fergana Valley. The great majority of the Sogdian people assimilated with other local groups such as the Bactrians, Chorasmians, and in particular with Persians and came to speak Persian. In 819 the Persians founded the Samanid Empire in the region. They are among the ancestors of the modern Tajiks. Numerous Sogdian <b>cognates</b> {{can be found in the}} modern Tajik language, although the latter is a Western Iranian language.|$|E

40|$|Background: The role of cognateness in bilingual {{language}} {{production has}} been the focus of much investigation. Many studies have found a <b>cognate</b> facilitation effect for reaction times and accuracy in naming in control participants (Costa, Caramazza & Sebastien-Galles, 2000; Rosselli, Ardila, Jurado,& Salvatierra, 2012) but the findings are by no means unequivocal e. g. Siyambalapitiya et al, 2009 observed a reversal of the <b>cognate</b> facilitation effect in older participants. The effect of cognateness has also been investigated in aphasic participants; Roberts & Deslauriers (199) observed a strong picture naming advantage for <b>cognate</b> words over non-cognate words, though no individual data were reported. Several case studies have reported <b>cognate</b> advantage in individuals, though results vary dependent on task and on the individual (Detry, Pillon & De Partz, 2005; Lalor & Kirsner, 2001). Furthermore, an inhibitory effect for <b>cognate</b> words has also been observed (Tiwari & Krishnan 2015). Overall, the above findings serve to illustrate that the facilitatory effect of <b>cognate</b> words is uncertain, and further investigation is required. Research Question: Does task type affect the <b>cognate</b> advantage in Welsh-English bilingual speakers? It is expected that patients will present with a picture naming advantage for <b>cognate</b> items. The expectations for a <b>cognate</b> advantage in translation are less assured, as the presentation of a <b>cognate</b> word in one language may inhibit access to its translation equivalent due to the phonological overlap, or the similarity may be facilitatory in activating the phonological representation of the target. Participants: 7 Welsh-English early proficient bilingual aphasic participants were selected for participation. Each patient scored significantly lower (p<. 05) than age-matched controls (N= 37) on at least one task using the modified t-tests for single cases (Crawford & Howell, 1998) Methods: Picture naming and translation tasks were administered in each language. Each task included 80 items, matched across languages for frequency, word length and number of <b>cognate</b> items; both naming and translation probed the same words. Results and discussion: As can be seen in the Figure, the effect of <b>cognate</b> status was highly variable across participants, languages and tasks. Only one participant showed a robust advantage in the 4 conditions. Overall, there was little evidence for <b>cognate</b> facilitation in the translation task, with 4 patients even showing an inhibitory effect of cognateness. This study on an unselected group of participants suggests that cognateness effects may partly reflect a publication bias and that a full understanding of the effects of <b>cognate</b> status will require future investigation...|$|R

40|$|The study {{examines}} the function and {{properties of the}} <b>cognate</b> object (CO) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). The analysis of the Arabic <b>cognate</b> object supports {{the argument that the}} <b>cognate</b> objects with unaccusative and unergative verbs occupy the adjunct position because they are adverbs, not arguments, so they don??t compete with the superficial subject (that originated as an object) for the complement position. _x 000 D_The <b>cognate</b> object in Arabic has traditionally been known as the absolute object among Arab grammarians and syntacticians. Even though the absolute object is an adjunct, it looks like an argument due to word order and case marking. The behavior of <b>cognate</b> objects in Arabic unaccusatives is linked to the fact that accusative case is inherent case. _x 000 D_I will show that the traditional analysis is wrong in treating the Arabic <b>cognate</b> object as a complement (argument) in the unaccusative and unergative structures.
