50|$|Further, {{interviews}} {{are typically}} {{designed to assess}} a number of <b>constructs.</b> Given the social nature of the interview, applicant responses to interview questions and interviewer evaluations of those responses are sometimes influenced by <b>constructs</b> beyond those the questions were intended to assess, making it extremely difficult to tease out the specific <b>constructs</b> measured during the interview. Reducing the number of <b>constructs</b> the interview is intended to assess may help mitigate this issue. Moreover, of practical importance is whether the interview is a better measure of some <b>constructs</b> in comparison to paper and pencil tests of the same <b>constructs.</b> Indeed, certain <b>constructs</b> (mental ability and skills, experience) may be better measured with paper and pencil tests than during the interview, whereas personality-related <b>constructs</b> seem to be better measured during the interview in comparison to paper and pencil tests of the same personality <b>constructs.</b> In sum, the following is recommended: Interviews should be developed to assess the job relevant <b>constructs</b> identified in the job analysis.|$|R
