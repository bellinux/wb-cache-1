40|$|The cowpea {{is a very}} {{important}} legume for peasant farmers in West Africa but this crop is very sensitive to bruchid attacks during storage. A study was carried out in a sub humid zone of Burkina Faso to determine the relation between the dynamic of bruchid and parasitoid populations in the fields and cowpea infestation at harvest. The variations in insect numbers were weekly estimated by net captures during the growth of an early and a late cowpea variety. Adults of two bruchid species, Callosobruchus maculatus (Fab.). and Bruchidius atrolineatus (Pic) appeared early in the fields before cowpea flowering and their population regularly increased over time and from early to late cowpea variety. The Pteromalid Dinarmus basalis Rond was the only larval parasitoid encountered. Its adults appeared later than bruchids and their parasitism activity increased over time. At harvest, 35 % of the early <b>cowpea</b> <b>pods</b> and 74. 5 % of the late <b>cowpea</b> <b>pods</b> were infested by bruchid eggs. 58. 5 and 72 % of the bruchid eggs laid respectively on the early and the late cowpea variety were parasitized by Uscana sp. The level of cowpea seed infestation by bruchids at the beginning of storage was estimated to be 1 and 2. 7 % for the early and late cowpea variety respectively. The parasitism rate of bruchid larvae by D. basalis was estimated at this period to be 7. 8 % for early cowpea variety and 18. 2 % for the late variety. These results are discussed in view of developing an integrated control method based on the enhancement of the pest natural enemies in the fields and/or into storage systems in combination with beneficial farming practices...|$|E

C. tomentosicollis pierce and suck sap from <b>cowpea</b> <b>pods,</b> resulting in reduced grain yield and quality. The complete, 16, 089 bp mitogenome of C. tomentosicollis encodes 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and an A + T rich control region, with gene order and orientation {{identical to that}} of the insect ancestral gene order. The initiation and termination codons for the PCGs used standard ATN codons and TAA or TAG codons respectively. All predicted tRNAs fold into a clover-leaf secondary structures with the exception of tRNA-Ser (AGN) with a semi-loop dihydrouridine arm. The 1509 bps A + T rich region contains a single 89 bp tandem repeat unit duplicated 3. 7 times. When compared with other published Coreoidea mitogenomes, C. tomentosicollis was also highly A − T skewed, and similar in both size and A − T%; however, its longer tandem repeat within the A + T rich region was unique. The C. tomentosicollis mitogenome can serve as a foundation to combine molecular marker data with pest monitoring strategies to better understand the population dynamics of this species.

40|$|Cowpea is an {{important}} component in several cropping systems prevalent in Africa. It is attacked by numerous insect pests, some of which have proved intractable in research so far. Efforts to control them have included host plant resistance and cultural practices, as well as agrochemicals. Biological control offers another possibility and neem, a plant that is often grown in backyards and along borders of crop fields offers considerable promise as an easily available source of natural chemical compounds to be harnessed for pest control. In Nigeria, where much of the world's cowpea is grown, aqueous extracts of neem are used to keep grasshoppers off the crop in the dry season. Neem leaves are soaked overnight and the solution sprinkled on cowpea plants using a shaped tree branch or broom. Despite this use, {{and the fact that it}} is known for its efficacy in controlling pests of stored products, neem has been little used as a control measure for other pests of cowpea. The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) has conducted field trials on two major pests of <b>cowpea,</b> the <b>pod</b> borer Maruca testulalis and the pod sucking bug Clavigralla tomentosicollis. Solutions made from ground neem seed or kernel were sprayed onto <b>cowpea</b> flowers and <b>pods.</b> The resulting low survival rates of both nymphal and adult pests were encouraging. Trials using neem oil derived formulations were also evaluated. Fears are sometimes expressed that neem could adversely affect pest predators, but evidence so far suggests that these fears are unjustified.

40|$|Aim/Background: Colletotrichum destructivum {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} causes of anthracnose disease of cowpea leading to a great reduction in their production and yield potentials. The constant application of chemicals to control these phytopathogens poses potential threats to human health and the environment. Potential non-chemical control strategy such as the use of botanicals would be a better alternative. Botanicals are readily available, safe, efficacious and eco-friendly. This study was undertaken to investigate the potentials of Cyathula prostrata and Diodia scandens leaf extracts to control the in vitro mycelial growth and sporulation of C. destructivum, causal agent of anthracnose disease of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp). Methods: The leaves of both plants were air dried, pulverized, and the fine powder extracted by conventional maceration techniques using aqueous solution. Prepared concentrations (40 - 100 %) of the extracts were then tested against the in vitro mycelial growth and spore germination of the purified test pathogen (C. destructivum) isolated from infected <b>cowpea</b> <b>pods.</b> Benomyl (3 %) was used as reference fungicide drug.

Farmyard manure, vermicompost and poultry manure were applied on the N content basis and additional requirements of P and K were met through application of rock phosphate and ash according to treatments. Phosphorus Solubilizing Microorganisms consisted of a mixture of Pseudomonas, Aspergillus and Azospirillum. Phosphorus Solubilizing Micro organisms @ 1 g plant - 1 was applied in T 3, T 5 and T 7 treatments. Entire P and K were applied basally and half the recommended N as basal and rest {{after two weeks of}} planting for all the treatments. The experiments were laid out in randomized block design with eight treatments and three replications. Lime was uniformly applied to all plots @ 250 kg ha- 1 to reduce the soil acidity. The results showed that organic farming practices improved physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil and helped for carbon sequestration. Organic manures also enhanced the soil enzyme activities such as dehydrogenase and phosphatase. All growth characters like height of plant, number and weight of nodules and leaf area index were found to be significantly boosted by organic treatments. The highest pod yield has been observed in Package of Practices recommendation treatment (T 1) followed by vermi compost + P Solubilizing Micro organism’s application (T 5).

The 1991 experiment consisted of two densities of cowpea and maize selected from the 1990 experiment in the best spatial arrangement crossed with five densities of cotton in a complete factorial design. A land use efficiency of 12 % (or a land equivalent ratio of 1. 12) was obtained in the spatial arrangement of single rows of cowpea and maize between singles rows of cotton, whereas a land use efficiency of 11 % was obtained for cowpea and maize at a combined density of 50, 000 plants/ha intercropped with cotton at a density of 50, 000 plants/ha. Maize provided a greater contribution to the land use efficiency than either cotton or cowpea. Cotton yield was highest in the spatial arrangement of single rows of cowpea and maize between single rows of cotton.

40|$|The {{regional}} {{population growth}} in West Africa, and especially its urban centers, will bring about new and critical challenges for urban development policy, {{especially in terms of}} ensuring food security and providing employment for the growing population. (Peri-) urban livestock and vegetable production systems, which can contribute significantly to these endeavours, are limited by various constraints, amongst them limited access to expensive production factors and their (in) efficient use. To achieve sustainable production systems with low consumer health risks, that can meet the urban increased demand, this doctoral thesis determined nutrient use efficiencies in representative (peri-) urban livestock production systems in three West African cities, and investigated potential health risks for consumers ensuing from there. The field study, which was conducted during July 2007 to December 2009, undertook a comparative analysis of (peri-) urban livestock production strategies across 210 livestock keeping households (HH) in the three West African cities of Kano/Nigeria (84 HH), Bobo Dioulasso/Burkina Faso (63 HH) and Sikasso/Mali (63 HH). These livestock enterprises were belonging to the following three farm types: commercial gardening plus field crops and livestock (cGCL; 88 HH), commercial livestock plus subsistence field cropping (cLsC; 109 HH) and commercial gardening plus semi-commercial livestock (cGscL; 13 HH) which had been classified in a preceding study; they represented the diversity of (peri-) urban livestock production systems in West Africa. In the study on the efficiency of ruminant livestock production, lactating cowsand sheep herd units were differentiated based on whether feed supplements were offered to the animals at the homestead (Go: grazing only; Gsf: mainly grazing plus some supplement feeding). Inflows and outflows of nutrients were quantified in these herds during 18 months, and the effects of seasonal variations in nutrient availability on animals’ productivity and reproductive performance was determined in Sikasso. To assess the safety of animal products and vegetables, contamination sources of irrigated lettuce and milk with microbiological contaminants, and of tomato and cabbage with pesticide residues in (peri-) urban agriculture systems of Bobo Dioulasso and Sikasso were characterized at three occasions in 2009. Samples of irrigation water, organic fertilizer and ix lettuce were collected in 6 gardens, and samples of cabbage and tomato in 12 gardens; raw and curdled milk were sampled in 6 dairy herds. Information on health risks for consumers of such foodstuffs was obtained from 11 health centers in Sikasso. In (peri-) urban livestock production systems, sheep and goats dominated (P 0. 05), but the proportion of HH heads with a long-term experience in (peri-) urban agriculture was higher in Kano and in Bobo Dioulasso than in Sikasso (P< 0. 001). Cattle and sheep fetched highest market prices in Kano; unit prices for goats and chicken were highest in Sikasso. Animal inflow, outflow and dairy herd growth rates were significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in the Gsf than in the Go cattle herds. Maize bran and cottonseed expeller were the main feeds offered to Gsf cows as dry-season supplement, while Gsf sheep received maize bran, fresh grasses and <b>cowpea</b> <b>pods.</b> The short periodic transhumance of Go dairy cows help them maintaining their live weight, whereas Gsf cows lost weight during the dry season despite supplement feeding at a rate of 1506 g dry matter per cow and day, resulting in low productivity and reproductive performance. The daily live weight gains of calves and lambs, respectively, were low and not significantly different between the Go and the Gsf system. However, the average live weight gains of lambs were significantly higher in the dry season (P< 0. 05) than in the rainy season because of the high pressure of gastrointestinal parasites and of Trypanosoma sp. In consequence, 47 % of the sheep leaving the Go and Gsf herds died due to diseases during the study period. Thermo-tolerant coliforms and Escherichia coli contamination levels of irrigation water significantly exceeded WHO recommendations for the unrestricted irrigation of vegetables consumed raw. Microbial contamination levels of lettuce at the farm gate and the market place in Bobo Dioulasso and at the farm gate in Sikasso were higher than at the market place in Sikasso (P< 0. 05). Pesticide residues were detected in only one cabbage and one tomato sample and were below the maximum residue limit for consumption. Counts of thermo-tolerant coliforms and Escherichia coli were higher in curdled than in raw milk (P< 0. 05). From 2006 to x 2009, cases of diarrhea/vomiting and typhoid fever had increased by 11 % and 48 %, respectively, in Sikasso. For ensuring economically successful and ecologically viable (peri-) urban livestock husbandry and food safety of (peri-) urban foodstuffs of animal and plant origin, the dissemination and adoption of improved feeding practices, livestock healthcare and dung management are key. In addition, measures fostering the safety of animal products and vegetables including the appropriate use of wastewater in (peri-) urban agriculture, restriction to approve vegetable pesticides and the respect of their latency periods, and passing and enforcement of safety laws is required. Finally, the incorporation of environmentally sound (peri-) urban agriculture in urban planning by policy makers, public and private extension agencies and the urban farmers themselves is of utmost importance. To enable an efficient (peri-) urban livestock production in the future, research should concentrate on cost-effective feeding systems that allow meeting the animals’ requirement for production and reproduction. Thereby focus should be laid on the use of crop-residues and leguminous forages. The improvement of the milk production potential through crossbreeding of local cattle breeds with exotic breeds known for their high milk yield might be an accompanying option, but it needs careful supervision to prevent the loss of the local trypanotolerant purebreds.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the most important}} production constraints and associated yield losses for six major food crops in 13 farming systems with high poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and East Asia, surveys were conducted with 672 experts representing a diversity of backgrounds and experience. Respondents reported large gaps between highest achieved crop yield on smallholder farms and average yield on farm. Yield gaps were smallest for rice (about 60 % of current average smallholder farm grain yields), mid size for wheat and cassava, and larger (sometimes double current farm yields) for sorghum, cowpea and chickpea. Gaps were also smaller in the high input and yield farming systems of East Asia and largest in the marginal, drier systems, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Four categories of production constraint (abiotic, biotic, management and socio-economic) were considered important contributors to yield gaps. A diversity of specific constraints was reported for the crops in the different systems. The most severe and widespread specific constraints for wheat involved the deficiency, high cost and poor management of N fertilizer, and problems associated with drought stress at grain filling, mid season drought and irrigation management. Those for rice included N fertilizer problems, soil fertility depletion, various leaf, stem and head pests and diseases, weed competition and inadequate water management. Striga and weed competition, soil resource degradation, poor soil fertility management, and drought were the most severe specific constraints for sorghum. Insect pests of pod, leaf, stem and flower and {{the high cost of}} their control dominated the constraint set for <b>cowpea.</b> Helicoverpa <b>pod</b> borer, Botrytis grey mould and control costs were the most severe for chickpea. Unsuitable varieties/poor seed, soil infertility and fertilizer constraints were also widespread with the legumes. Marketing problems and lack of finance were concerns for cassava along with weed competition, African cassava mosaic virus and poor varieties/planting materials. The findings can help to inform priority setting for international agricultural research and development activities on important food crops in major farming systems occupying areas of high poverty.

40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} 2005 and 2006 rainy season at the Institute for Agricultural Research farm, Samaru, Nigeria, to test the response of four cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L) Walp] varieties to residual effect of four rates of sheep manure (FYM) (0, 5, 10 and 15 t/ha) applied the previous season to chilli pepper [Capsicum annuum]. Each of the experiment was a follow up to a previous one conducted in 2004 and 2005 to test the response of pepper to those rates of FYM. Applications of different rate of FYM had significant residual effect on soil chemical content. The combined results showed significant difference among the cowpea varieties for grain yield and yield components. Mean cowpea grain yield ranged from 1. 7 t/ha in IT 96 D- 757 to 2. 7 t/ha in IT 97 K- 499 - 35. Previous FYM application rate significantly affected <b>cowpea</b> grain yield, <b>pod</b> weight, number of seeds per pod, seed weight per pod and threshing percentage. However, 100 -seed weight was not significantly affected. Cowpea grain yield ranged from 1. 4 t/ha in plots without FYM to 2. 4 t/ha in plots that had 10 or 15 t/ha previous year. Significant interaction was not observed between cowpea variety and previous manure application rate. Peer Revie...|$|R
