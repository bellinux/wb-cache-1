5|$|Mimi pulls Carey in two {{opposite}} directions. Most of {{the tracks}} find her paired with the hottest hip hop producers of the day; there, she exercises restraint and settles into a groove. But on the rest, she does what comes most naturally to her—belting to her heart's desire, perhaps to mollify those who don't <b>care</b> <b>much</b> for her detours into raunchier rap territory.|$|E
5|$|Pollard {{transferred}} to the United States Military Academy on March 22, where he played under coach Red Blaik. Vince Lombardi was their backfield coach. Due to transfer rules, Pollard was forced to sit out the 1949 season, and he enrolled at Rutherford Preparatory School to pass West Point's entrance exam. While at Army, {{he was known to}} focus his attention mainly on football, and not <b>care</b> <b>much</b> for academics. Gil Reich, his roommate at West Point, noted that he and several other friends of Pollard frequently helped each other so as to not see anyone drop out.|$|E

5|$|At the Post's home, Hal Dunton {{sits down}} with his love {{interest}} Sue Post, cautiously {{checking to see if}} they are alone. Hal then proposes to Sue and in the excitement, her father comes into the room. He is outraged and believes his daughter is too young to be married and promptly makes Hal leave before scolding his daughter. Before departing, Hal meets and pleads with the father as he takes the daughter away by car. The father refuses and Hal is knocked down before the father and daughter depart to a boarding school. The father meets with the mistress and leaves Sue in her <b>care,</b> <b>much</b> to Sue's distress.|$|E
5|$|Mary Patricia Mohan {{was born}} at 2 Third Avenue, Fazakerley, Liverpool. After two years Mary's father met and married his second wife, Rose, while {{on a trip to}} Monaghan, in Ireland. Rose arrived in Liverpool with two {{children}} from a previous marriage, but Mary, who had until then been looking after the Mohan family, realised that Rose did not <b>care</b> <b>much</b> for domesticity or her new husband's children. After a year she chose to live with her aunts. In 1923, at the age of 14 years, Mary started work as a nurse trainee at the Smithdown Road Hospital, and then took a three-year training course at Walton Road Hospital in Rice Lane, Liverpool, eventually becoming a state registered nurse.|$|E
25|$|Fronto {{was highly}} esteemed: he was {{thought of as}} second only to Cicero, perhaps even an {{alternative}} to him. He did not <b>care</b> <b>much</b> for Herodes, though Marcus was eventually to put the pair on speaking terms. Fronto exercised a complete mastery of Latin, capable of tracing expressions through the literature, producing obscure synonyms, and challenging minor improprieties in word choice. The Latin literary world {{of the day was}} self-consciously antiquarian: authors of the Silver Age—Seneca, Lucan, Martial, Juvenal, Pliny, Suetonius, and Tacitus—were ignored; only the greatest of the Golden Age, Virgil and Cicero, were widely read; only that pair and earlier writers, like Cato, Plautus, Terence, Gaius Gracchus, and (somewhat anachronistically) Sallust, were cited.|$|E

25|$|According to the chronicles, she was hugely {{disappointed}} by the ineffectual Kyawswa whose real authority did not extend beyond a small region around Pagan. The real power in central Burma now belonged to the three former Pagan commanders and brothers from the nearby Myinsaing. She felt betrayed when Kyawswa, who wanted to counter the rising power of the brothers, {{decided to become a}} vassal of the Mongols in 1297. Though she did not <b>care</b> <b>much</b> for the three brothers, whom she viewed as usurpers, she plotted with them to remove Kyawswa. In December 1297, she persuaded Kyawswa to visit Myinsaing, ostensibly to lead a dedication ceremony of a monastery. Kyawswa felt secure and went to Myinsaing. But as soon as the ceremony was over, he was arrested, dethroned, and forced to become a monk in the very monastery he had just dedicated.|$|E

500|$|The review {{aggregator}} website Rotten Tomatoes {{reported an}} approval rating of 10% based on 86 reviews, {{with an average}} rating of 3.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "Joel Schumacher's tongue-in-cheek attitude hits an unbearable limit in Batman & Robin, resulting in a frantic and mindless movie that's too jokey to <b>care</b> <b>much</b> for." [...] On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 28 out of 100, based on 21 critics, signifying [...] "generally unfavorable reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of [...] "C+" [...] on an A+ to F scale.|$|E
500|$|Donoghue {{wrote in}} The New York Times {{that he did}} not <b>care</b> <b>much</b> about what {{happened}} to Alice and her comrades. He felt that Lessing presents Alice as [...] "an unquestioned rigmarole of reactions and prejudices", which leaves no room for any further interest. Donoghue complained that Lessing has not made up her mind on whether her characters are [...] "the salt of the earth or its scum". In a review in the Chicago Tribune, Kuehn felt that the work has little impact and is not memorable. He said Lessing's real interest is character development, but complained that the characters are [...] "trivial or two-dimensional or crippled by self-delusions".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{watches a}} chick flick with Lois, and is deeply moved by it. After renting several other chick flicks, Peter decides {{to make one}} of his own with his friends, {{entitled}} Steel Vaginas. The plot stars Peter as a man who claims he does not <b>care</b> <b>much</b> for women until he meets [...] "Vageena Hertz", played by Lois, who is also his own daughter in the film. After Vageena almost drowns when she goes swimming too soon after eating, she is rushed to the hospital, but dies of an angry hymen. The film ends and is received badly by Peter's friends due to its poor plot outline, structure and not making any sense.|$|E

500|$|The {{innovator}} {{does not}} tend to <b>care</b> <b>much</b> about free speech, since {{they engage in}} innovation despite social resistance. Innovators may be separated into three categories: the hard millenarians, who believe in their doctrine {{to the exclusion of}} all others, and who only seek to protect the dissemination of their own creeds; the virtuous millenarians, who emphasise that revolutionary transitions must begin through rational persuasion and the guidance of sages, and so are supportive of free speech; and the progressives, who cannot foresee the direction of future progress, but recognise that the free exchange of ideas is a prerequisite to it. For the philosopher, free speech allows people to engage in rational doubt, and to grow in their prudential duties. (Russell 1938:182–185) ...|$|E
500|$|Bahrain became {{independent}} from the United Kingdom in 1971 and the Constituent Assembly of 1972 had drafted {{a new constitution}} by 1973. Like his study colleague Isa Qassim, al-Jamri initially wanted to complete his religious studies and did not <b>care</b> <b>much</b> about politics. His mentor in Iraq, Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr, issued a binding fatwā {{for participation in the}} 1973 parliamentary election. Al-Jamri and five others formed the [...] "Religious Bloc" [...] which adopted a wide program including supporting the labor's union and demands, forbidding trade of alcoholic beverages, and separating men and women in education institutes. The bloc also called for prohibiting male doctors from treating female patients (especially in pregnancy) as well as other demands connected to traditional Islamic customs. Al-Jamri was elected to the National Assembly of Bahrain, ranking second behind Isa Qassim.|$|E

She said, [...] "I don't <b>care</b> <b>much</b> for the other judges...Ronan thinks he knows it all [...] Natalie is just too nice and really dishonest. Guy could just be boring, like 'get on with it. Keep it moving, brother.'" [...] During a radio interview with The Kyle and Jackie O Show on 29 August 2011, Bassingthwaighte responded to Mel B's comments saying, [...] "I think it's in fun – I hope so otherwise she deserves a slap." [...] Mel B appeared on the same radio show the following day and said, [...] "They're all scared of me and I love it, there's got to be one bitch on the show so I might as well take that bloody crown." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite initial {{negative}} reactions from comics fans {{prior to the}} film's release, Keaton's portrayal of Batman was generally praised. James Berardinelli called the film entertaining, with the highlight being the production design. However, he concluded, [...] "the best thing {{that can be said}} about Batman is that it led to Batman Returns, which was a far superior effort." [...] Variety felt [...] "Jack Nicholson stole every scene" [...] but still greeted the film with positive feedback. Roger Ebert was highly impressed with the production design, but claimed [...] "Batman is a triumph of design over story, style over substance, a great-looking movie with a plot you can't <b>care</b> <b>much</b> about." [...] He also called the film [...] "a depressing experience". His reviewing partner Gene Siskel disagreed, describing the film as having a 'refreshingly adult' approach with performances, direction and set design that 'draws you into a psychological world'.|$|E
500|$|In past years, October {{also was}} when eagerly {{anticipated}} horror films reached screens, {{to capitalize on}} the approach of Halloween {{at the end of the}} month. However, this began to change in the 2000s due to the way franchises such as the Saw and Paranormal Activity films dominated that period, prompting distributors of other horror films to consider releasing them during the winter dump months instead. In 2012 Paramount enjoyed huge success with the unheralded The Devil Inside, released right after New Year's Day despite a strongly negative critical and audience reaction; the next year Mama was received enthusiastically by critics and filmgoers when it came out on Martin Luther King Day weekend after being rescheduled from the previous October to avoid going up against Sinister and Paranormal Activity 4. Only one major horror film, the third adaptation of Stephen King's Carrie, was released in October 2013, and it underperformed. [...] "At your local multiplex, the spirit of Halloween is, sadly, dead," [...] Matt Barone wrote in Complex. [...] "Horror's now too big of a business for major studios to <b>care</b> <b>much</b> about October." ...|$|E
500|$|As a Polish {{delegate}} at the Paris Peace Conference and a signatory of the Versailles Treaty, Dmowski exerted {{a substantial}} {{influence on the}} Treaty's favorable decisions regarding Poland. On 29 January 1919, Dmowski met with the Allies' Supreme War Council for the first time; his five-hour presentation there, delivered in English and French, was described as brilliant. At the meeting, Dmowski stated that he {{had little interest in}} laying claim to areas of Ukraine and Lithuania that were formerly part of Poland, but no longer had a Polish majority. At the same time Dmowski strongly pressed for the return of Polish territories with Polish-speaking majorities taken by Prussia from Poland in 1790s. Dmowski himself admitted that from a purely historical point of view, the Polish claims to Silesia were not entirely strong, but he claimed it for Poland on economic grounds, especially the coal fields. Moreover, Dmowski claimed that German statistics had lied about the number of ethnic Poles living in eastern Germany and that, [...] "these Poles were some of the most educated and highly cultured in the nation, with a strong sense of nationality and men of progressive ideas". In addition, Dmowski, with the strong backing of the French, wanted to send the [...] "Blue Army" [...] to Poland via Danzig, Germany (modern Gdańsk, Poland); it was the intention of both Dmowski and the French that the Blue Army create a territorial fait accompli. This proposal created much opposition from the Germans, the British and the Americans, and finally the Blue Army was sent to Poland in April 1919 via land. Piłsudski was opposed to needlessly annoying the Allies, and {{it has been suggested that}} he did not <b>care</b> <b>much</b> about the Danzig issue.|$|E
