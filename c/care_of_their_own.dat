5|$|The {{earliest}} {{terms for}} classifying individuals of low intelligence were medical or legal terms {{that preceded the}} development of IQ testing. The legal system recognized a concept of some individuals being so cognitively impaired {{that they were not}} responsible for criminal behavior. Medical doctors sometimes encountered adult patients who could not live independently, being unable to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> daily living needs. Various terms were used to attempt to classify individuals with varying degrees of intellectual disability. Many of the earliest terms are now considered very offensive.|$|E

5|$|Most colonies are monogyne, {{meaning that}} a colony {{only has a}} single queen, but based on observations, some nests contain {{more than a single}} queen. Some nests are known to contain two queens, with some even having as many as four in a single colony, making them polygynous; a high {{proportion}} of queens living in polygynous nests are unrelated to one another. Some colonies are oligogynous, which means that multiple queens are present in a colony, but they are tolerated by all workers birthed from different queens and treated equally. Tolerance still occurs even when new reproductive females and males are born, but recognition based on kin from queens and workers is known, hinting brood discrimination when the larvae are fed or groomed; queens will only take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> brood and neglect to look after broods laid by other queens. The queens, on the other hand, will only cooperate with each other during nest founding, but will be antagonistic once there are workers present in the colony. Queens become more intolerant of each other as the colony grows, and eventually separate within the nest, resulting in the queen laying more eggs. Such cases usually happen when pleometrotic founding occurs, or if a queen ant is adopted by a colony, setting up aggressive relationships. Physical fights between queens in the same colony are rare.|$|E

Caring for an aging family member is a difficult life situations for a caring person {{but also for the}} elderly. How they cope with the situation, largely depends on the quality <b>of</b> <b>their</b> relationship. The paper presents the theories related to emotional solidarity in elderly care, mainly the theory of V. L.

Hynek Jerabek et al. "Family Cohesion 2010 " and analyzes the mutual relationship between the one who cares and elderly family member who need help. To find the factors that affect relationships, is used linear regression analysis factors are currently being compared to the situation <b>of</b> home <b>care</b> and for <b>care</b> with help <b>of</b> the institutions. The conclusions of the analysis confirm the assumption that emotional solidarity is most often provided kind of help.
