50|$|The PMG {{was planned}} {{to test the}} ability of a Hollow <b>Cathode</b> <b>Assembly</b> (HCA) to provide a low-impedance bipolar {{electric}} current between a spacecraft and the ionosphere. In addition, other expectations were to show that the mission configuration could function as an orbit-boosting motor as well as a generator, by converting orbital energy into electricity. The tether was a 500 m length of insulated 18 gauge copper wire.The mission was launched on 26 June 1993, as the secondary payload on a Delta II rocket. The total experiment lasted approximately seven hours. In that time, the results demonstrated that current is fully reversible, and therefore was capable of generating power and orbit boosting modes. The hollow cathode was able to provide a low-power way of connecting the current to and from the ambient plasma. This means that the HC demonstrated its electron collection and emission capabilities.|$|E
