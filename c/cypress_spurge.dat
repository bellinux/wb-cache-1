50|$|Euphorbia cyparissias, the <b>cypress</b> <b>spurge,</b> is {{a species}} of plant in the genus Euphorbia. It is native to Europe and was {{introduced}} to North America in the 1860s as an ornamental plant.|$|E
50|$|Natural {{habitat types}} include dunes, pannes, coastal {{headlands}} and grasslands. In North America {{it is commonly}} found in the dry, gravelly soil of roadsides, pastures, and meadows. <b>Cypress</b> <b>spurge</b> thrives in open, disturbed areas.|$|E
5000|$|The {{caterpillars}} reach {{a length}} up to 55 millimeters. They are polyphagous, feeding mainly on Field Wormwood ( [...] Artemisia campestris), Sambucus sp., Rose ( [...] Rosa sp.), Blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), Broom (Cytisus scoparius), Taraxacum sp., Birch (Betula sp.), Arbutus sp., Pimpinella sp., Clover (Melilotus sp.), <b>Cypress</b> <b>Spurge</b> ( [...] Euphorbia sp.), Acacia ( [...] Mimosa longifolia), Mimosa dealbata, Salvia sp. and Salix glabra. In India, the pest {{has been reported}} to infest on Prosopis (Prosopis juliflora), Delonix regia and Sal (Shorea robusta). A nucleopolyhedrovirus suppressing populations of Ascotis seleneria has been reported in India. In many areas they are considered a pest causing serious damages to agriculture. They pupate and overwinter in the soil.|$|E
5000|$|The adult beetle {{is light}} {{golden brown and}} about 3 {{millimeters}} long. The female lays eggs on or near leafy spurge, its host plant, during the summer months. The white larva emerges in about two weeks and feeds on the roots and root hairs. It is active through {{the fall and winter}} until the cold stimulates it to pupate. It burrows into the soil to undergo a three-week pupation. Damage to the plant occurs when the larva eats the roots and the adult feeds on the leaves and flowers. Heavy beetle activity kills the plant. This beetle is a spurge specialist, preferring <b>cypress</b> <b>spurge</b> (Euphorbia cyparissias) in its native range and readily attacking leafy spurge as its first alternate.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cypress</b> <b>spurge</b> (Euphorbia cyparissias L.) is a {{herbaceous}} European perennial {{introduced into}} North America as an ornamental {{plant in the}} 1860 s (Croizat, 1945). It was widely planted in graveyards and often is called graveyard weed (Muenscher, 1936). The plant escaped cultivation and became established on open ground, particularly in pastures (Stuckey and Pearson, 1973) ...|$|E
40|$|Euphorbia cyparissias L. is an {{herbaceous}} species, wide-spread in {{the flora}} of Romania, often founded in plant cultures and roadsides. This report describes the floral morphogenesis in the <b>cypress</b> <b>spurge.</b> The vegetative {{activity of the}} shoot apex early ends by forming the inflorescence bracts, which have a different morphology and structure than the nomophylls. Each branch of the dichasial inflorescence ends with a single cyathium. The order of appearance of the cyathium components is as follows: monostaminate male flowers, involucre, nectary glands and female flower...|$|E
30|$|Where observation-based {{information}} on fire was absent, review authors often inferred potential fire relationships from botanical and ecological data, which {{was available for}} most species reviews. When authors based an assertion on inference, they described {{the basis for the}} inference rather than presenting it as though based on observation. For example, although immediate fire effects on common tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) were not reported in the literature, the species review (Gucker 2009 e) reports that its rhizomes are generally robust, sturdy, and stout, suggesting that they would likely survive fire. Several species reviews had no {{information on}} postfire seedling establishment but noted the species’ wind-dispersed seed or successful seedling establishment in high-light environments (e.g., marsh thistle [Cirsium palustre] [Gucker 2009 a], swallow-worts [Cynanchum louiseae and C. rossicum] [Stone 2009 a], giant hogweed [Heracleum mantegazzianum] [Gucker 2009 c], silkreed [Stone 2010], and white poplar [Populus alba] [Gucker 2010 b]). These reviews described the species as having high potential for establishment in the postfire environment if a seed source is nearby. Gucker’s (2010 a) review describes <b>cypress</b> <b>spurge</b> (Euphorbia cyparissias), with its typically hard seed coat and persistent seed bank, as potentially regenerating from seed after fire. Inferences such as these should be applied to management issues with caution until observations from test plots or monitoring indicate whether the species responds as expected.|$|E
40|$|Geochemical {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} in order to systematically analyse soils collected from several burial sites. Through the extraction and GC analysis of burial soils organic signatures that inform {{an understanding of the}} burial environment, including aspects relating to the individual or culture in which they lived, have been obtained. GC analysis revealed that the profiles of several lipid signatures found in the burial soil samples, including n-alkanes, n-alkanals, n-alkanols, fatty acids and steroids, have shown similarities to signatures relating to degraded human adipose tissue and bacterial signatures. The abundance of lipid signatures increases around the skeletal remains, particularly the gut region, which suggests that these components are present because of the remains. Fatty acids and steroids have been typically found in the analysis of tissues from mummies and bog bodies and are also present in adipocere, although the oxidative degradation products (hydroxy fatty acid and diacids) that have also been observed in these tissues have been absent during this study. However fatty acid reduction products such as n-alkanes, n-alkanals and n-alkanols have been observed in several of the graves suggesting that the remains can undergo microbial reduction in the soil. In addition several specific signatures that are exclusive to only a few samples from the remains have provided information {{on the nature of the}} burial. The presence of coprostanol in the burial samples has the potential to infer on the individuals last meal, while the presence of specific resin acids within the soil provides information on the materials used to construct a coffin. The presence of pine diterpenoids observed in a burial from Iceland has suggested that materials, such as pine, were imported at the time as pine trees are not native to Iceland. Another specific plant signature, Hopenone b, has further revealed information about the nature of the burial inferring that the plant <b>Cypress</b> <b>Spurge</b> (also known as grave yard weed) was present within close proximity to the grave. ...|$|E
