5|$|Hydrogen sponge alloys <b>can</b> <b>contain</b> lanthanum. These alloys {{are capable}} of storing up to 400 times their own volume of {{hydrogen}} gas in a reversible adsorption process. Heat energy is released every time they do so; therefore these alloys have possibilities in energy conservation systems.|$|E

5|$|The {{relation}} between Cr(III) and Cr(VI) strongly depends on pH and oxidative {{properties of the}} location. In most cases, Cr(III) is the dominating species, but in some areas, the ground water <b>can</b> <b>contain</b> up to 39µg/liter of total chromium of which 30µg/liter is Cr(VI).|$|E
5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a parcel of air <b>can</b> <b>contain</b> before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air <b>can</b> <b>contain</b> more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E
5|$|Arrays <b>can</b> <b>contain</b> {{elements}} {{of any type}} that PHP can handle, including resources, objects, and other arrays. Order is preserved in lists of values and in hashes with both keys and values, and the two can be intermingled. PHP also supports strings, {{which can be used}} with single quotes, double quotes, nowdoc or heredoc syntax.|$|E

5|$|Genotyping arrays {{designed}} for GWAS rely on linkage disequilibrium to provide {{coverage of the}} entire genome by genotyping a subset of variants. Because of this, the reported associated variants {{are unlikely to be}} the actual causal variants. Associated regions <b>can</b> <b>contain</b> hundreds of variants spanning large regions and encompassing many different genes, making the biological interpretation of GWAS loci more difficult. Fine-mapping is a process to refine these lists of associated variants to a credible set most likely to include the causal variant.|$|E
5|$|Poisoning {{typically}} {{results from}} ingestion of {{food or water}} contaminated with lead, and less commonly after accidental ingestion of contaminated soil, dust, or lead-based paint. Seawater products <b>can</b> <b>contain</b> lead if affected by nearby industrial waters. Fruit and vegetables can be contaminated by high levels of lead in the soils they were grown in. Soil can be contaminated through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes, lead paint, and residual emissions from leaded gasoline.|$|E
5|$|Soils {{contaminated}} with zinc from mining, refining, or fertilizing with zinc-bearing sludge <b>can</b> <b>contain</b> several grams of zinc per kilogram of dry soil. Levels of zinc {{in excess of}} 500ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals, such as iron and manganese. Zinc levels of 2000ppm to 180,000ppm (18%) have been recorded in some soil samples.|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{a notable}} variety of enemies, the player has a {{limited range of}} {{abilities}} and power-ups available to them. The Thunder Master II vehicle is equipped with only two weapons: the basic 'ionic phaser' gun (activated with Button 1), and missiles (activated with Buttons 1 and 2 together). [...] The player must keep the Thunder Master II fuelled by making contact with cans placed in the road: blue <b>cans</b> <b>contain</b> fuel which allow the vehicle to continue driving on the highway, and red <b>cans</b> <b>contain</b> kerosene which permit the vehicle to fly. [...] The two types of fuel are indicated by two separate fuel gauges.|$|R
5|$|Starlings' {{droppings}} <b>can</b> <b>contain</b> {{the fungus}} Histoplasma capsulatum, {{the cause of}} histoplasmosis in humans. At roosting sites this fungus can thrive in accumulated droppings. There {{are a number of}} other infectious diseases that can potentially be transmitted by common starlings to humans, although the potential for the birds to spread infections may have been exaggerated.|$|E
5|$|The human {{mitochondrial}} genome is {{a circular}} DNA molecule of about 16 kilobases. It encodes 37 genes: 13 for subunits of respiratory complexes I, III, IV and V, 22 for mitochondrial tRNA (for the 20 standard amino acids, plus an extra gene for leucine and serine), and 2 for rRNA. One mitochondrion <b>can</b> <b>contain</b> two to ten copies of its DNA.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{travels in}} crude lead bullion (which <b>can</b> <b>contain</b> up to 10% bismuth) through several stages of refining, {{until it is}} removed by the Kroll-Betterton process which {{separates}} the impurities as slag, or the electrolytic Betts process. Bismuth will behave similarly with another of its major metals, copper. The raw bismuth metal from both processes contains still considerable amounts of other metals, foremost lead. By reacting the molten mixture with chlorine gas the metals are converted to their chlorides while bismuth remains unchanged. Impurities can also be removed by various other methods for example with fluxes and treatments yielding high-purity bismuth metal (over 99% Bi). World bismuth production from refineries is a more complete and reliable statistic.|$|E

5|$|Fish species {{diversity}} is roughly divided equally between marine (oceanic) and freshwater ecosystems. Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific constitute {{the center of}} diversity for marine fishes, whereas continental freshwater fishes are most diverse in large river basins of tropical rainforests, especially the Amazon, Congo, and Mekong basins. More than 5,600 fish species inhabit Neotropical freshwaters alone, such that Neotropical fishes represent about 10% of all vertebrate species on the Earth. Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin, such as Cantão State Park, <b>can</b> <b>contain</b> more freshwater fish species than occur in all of Europe.|$|E
5|$|In Earth's crust, {{scandium}} is not rare. Estimates {{vary from}} 18 to 25ppm, which {{is comparable to}} the abundance of cobalt (20–30ppm). Scandium is only the 50th most common element on Earth (35th most abundant in the crust), but it is the 23rd most common element in the Sun. However, scandium is distributed sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals. Rare minerals from Scandinavia and Madagascar such as thortveitite, euxenite, and gadolinite are the only known concentrated sources of this element. Thortveitite <b>can</b> <b>contain</b> up to 45% of scandium in the form of scandium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|It {{shares the}} same nesting biology as S.speciosus. All cicada killers are ground-nesting insects and nest aggregations <b>can</b> <b>contain</b> up to {{hundreds}} of nests, each with a single provisioning female. Their tunnel is mainly made in well-drained, bare sandy soil, frequently under sidewalks, but is generally in full sunlight. Approximately 90% of its life is spent underground as a larva. It rarely infests grounds that are rich in vegetation {{in order for them}} to get more sun. Mounds are easily recognizable by their distinctive U-shaped digging entrance.|$|E

25|$|Tin is {{corrosion}} resistant, but acidic food like {{fruits and}} vegetables can corrode the tin layer. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been reported after ingesting <b>canned</b> food <b>containing</b> 200mg/kg of tin. A 2002 study showed that 99.5% of 1200 tested <b>cans</b> <b>contained</b> below the UK regulatory limit of 200mg/kg of tin, an improvement over most previous studies largely attributed to {{the increased use of}} fully lacquered cans for acidic foods, and concluded that the results do not raise any long term food safety concerns for consumers. The two non-compliant products were voluntarily recalled.|$|R
