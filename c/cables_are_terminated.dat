5000|$|A {{pedestal}} {{is generally}} a sheet metal or plastic housing that encloses a passive termination block. The pedestal is usually about 3 {{feet high and}} has a diameter of less than one foot, with a circular, rectangular, oval, or [...] "rounded rectangle" [...] cross-section. The pedestal either has an access panel or removable housing. One, two, three or (occasionally) more underground distribution cables rise from the ground {{into the bottom of}} the pedestal and the individual circuits from the <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> <b>terminated</b> on the termination block. In addition to distribution cables, the pedestal may terminate one or more individual underground subscriber cables. The cables are cross-connected as needed at the termination block.|$|E
50|$|Connectors {{use either}} T568A or T568B pin assignments; {{performance}} is comparable provided {{both ends of}} a <b>cable</b> <b>are</b> <b>terminated</b> identically.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, {{one end of}} a <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> <b>terminated</b> in {{the data}} cabinet. The other end of a cable ends at the desk. The cable {{management}} needs at either end are different.|$|R
50|$|In 2014 Soviet-era <b>cable</b> radio <b>was</b> <b>terminated,</b> {{particularly}} affecting {{old people}} who {{had this kind of}} radio in the kitchen.|$|R
50|$|Econet is a five-wire bus network. One pair {{of wires}} {{is used for}} the clock, one pair for data, and one wire as a common ground. Signalling used the RS-422 5-volt {{differential}} standard, with one bit transferred per clock cycle. Unshielded <b>cable</b> <b>was</b> used for short lengths, and shielded cable for longer networks. The <b>cable</b> <b>was</b> <b>terminated</b> at each end to prevent reflections and to guarantee high logic levels when the bus was undriven.|$|R
50|$|Cable types, {{connector}} {{types and}} <b>cabling</b> topologies <b>are</b> defined by TIA/EIA-568-B. Nearly always, 8P8C modular connectors (often {{referred to as}} RJ45 connectors) are used for connecting category 5 <b>cable.</b> The <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> <b>terminated</b> in either the T568A scheme or the T568B scheme. The two schemes work equally well and may be mixed in an installation {{so long as the}} same scheme is used on both ends of each cable.|$|R
50|$|When used to {{terminate}} cables, in some applications {{both ends of}} the <b>cable</b> <b>are</b> <b>terminated</b> using identical connectors (generally male), as in registered jack telephone cables or Ethernet over twisted pair network cables, while in other applications the two ends <b>are</b> <b>terminated</b> differently, either with male and female of the same connector (as in an extension cord), which ends can be connected to each other in a loop, or with incompatible connectors, in an adapter cable.|$|R
50|$|Blaabjerg and {{the city}} of Nørre Nebel is home to a landing station where {{multiple}} transatlantic telephone <b>cable</b> systems <b>are</b> <b>terminated,</b> including TAT-14, CANTAT-3 and DANICE.|$|R
50|$|When a <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> <b>terminated</b> by a connector, {{the various}} wires in the <b>cable</b> <b>are</b> {{connected}} to contacts (pins) in the connector. The most common methods of connecting pins to individual wires are soldering, insulation displacement, insulation piercing, screw clamping, axial screw termination, cage clamping, crimping, press-in termination, and wire wrapping. Some of these wiring methods {{can be accomplished}} without specialized tools. Other methods, while requiring a special tool, can assemble connectors to a cable much faster and more reliably, and make repairs easier.|$|R
50|$|The {{landings}} in Namibia, the DRC, the Republic of Congo and Togo {{will provide}} the first direct connections for these countries to the global submarine cable network. While all earlier submarine <b>cables</b> <b>were</b> <b>terminated</b> at South Africa's international submarine gateways in Melkbosstrand or Mtunzini the WACS <b>cable</b> has <b>been</b> landed at Yzerfontein {{in order to reduce}} risk of complete isolation {{from the rest of the}} world in the case of damages by earthquakes or a large ship dragging its anchor.|$|R
50|$|Cat 6 patch <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> {{normally}} <b>terminated</b> in 8P8C modular connectors. If Cat 6 rated patch cables, jacks and connectors are {{not used}} with Cat 6 wiring, overall performance is degraded and may not meet Cat 6 performance specifications.|$|R
50|$|The Australian {{end of the}} <b>Cable</b> <b>was</b> <b>terminated</b> in mid November 2007 by the Cable Ship Ile de Re {{completing}} the laying of the cable. The fibre optic <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> laid in the Northern Sydney Protection Zone and comes ashore at Narrabeen beach where the Southern Cross Cable and Australia-Japan <b>Cable</b> <b>are</b> also laid. The system was officially brought into service in September 2008. Gondwana drastically boosted {{the capacity of the}} New Caledonia international gateway and decreased the latency to reach Australia and Western Europe, previously handicapped by a 500 ms round trip delay between Australian and Caledonian satellite teleport. It offers the second fibre access point in South Pacific islands after Fijian access to Southern Cross cable, commissioned in 2001.|$|R
5000|$|Antenna types vary {{depending}} on location; an urban area with nearby transmitters will require a smaller antenna than a rural site with distant stations. The antenna is often mounted outdoors on the roof or a tower. A coaxial or twinlead <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> run from the antenna to the location where the television is located. One common type of <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> designated RG-6 Tri-shield or quad-shield <b>cable.</b> The <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> <b>terminated</b> on a television outlets, typically an F connector mounted on a face plate. If there are multiple outlets, an RF splitter is used to divide the signal among them; outlets on the splitter are connected to television outlets at each location (living room, rec room, bedrooms, den, for example). RF splitters come with different types; some include amplifiers for multiple outlets.|$|R
50|$|All of the {{components}} of a coaxial system should have the same impedance to avoid internal reflections at connections between components. Such reflections may cause signal attenuation and ghosting TV picture display; multiple reflections may cause the original signal to be followed by more than one echo. In analog video or TV systems, this causes ghosting in the image. Reflections also introduce standing waves, which cause increased losses and can even result in cable dielectric breakdown with high-power transmission (see Impedance matching). Briefly, if a coaxial <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> open, the termination has nearly infinite resistance, this causes reflections; if the coaxial <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> short-circuited, the termination resistance is nearly zero, there will be reflections with the opposite polarity. Reflection will be nearly eliminated if the coaxial <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> <b>terminated</b> in a pure resistance equal to its impedance.|$|R
50|$|Taiwan {{terminated}} over-the-air {{analogue broadcasting}} on 30 June 2012, {{and the remainder}} of the analogue system ended in 2014, when the analogue <b>cable</b> television broadcasts <b>were</b> <b>terminated.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Category 7 <b>cable</b> {{standard}} has <b>been</b> ratified in 2002 {{to allow}} 10 Gigabit Ethernet over 100 m of copper cabling. The cable contains four twisted copper wire pairs, {{just like the}} earlier standards. Category 7 <b>cable</b> can <b>be</b> <b>terminated</b> either with 8P8C compatible GG45 electrical connectors which incorporate the 8P8C standard or with TERA connectors. When combined with GG-45 or TERA connectors, Category 7 <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> rated for transmission frequencies of up to 600 MHz.|$|R
5000|$|For indoor applications, the {{jacketed}} fiber {{is generally}} enclosed, with {{a bundle of}} flexible fibrous polymer strength members like aramid (e.g. Twaron or Kevlar), in a lightweight plastic cover to form a simple cable. Each end of the <b>cable</b> may <b>be</b> <b>terminated</b> with a specialized optical fiber connector {{to allow it to}} be easily connected and disconnected from transmitting and receiving equipment.|$|R
2500|$|In 1978, two cable messages, Jerusalem 1500 and Jerusalem 3239, {{sent from}} the US Consulate General in Jerusalem to the US Department of State in Washington, D.C., {{described}} abusive methods allegedly used by Israeli authorities to interrogate Palestinian detainees in Jerusalem and the West Bank. Alexandra U. Johnson, the consular officer {{who wrote the}} <b>cables,</b> <b>was</b> <b>terminated</b> from the United States Foreign Service later that year; the cables {{became the focus of}} controversy when their contents became public in 1979. [...] A third report, Jerusalem A-19, sent as an airgram message from the Consulate General in Jerusalem to the Department of State in October 1978, described the military trial of two young American citizens who reported that Israeli authorities used physical coercion to obtain confessions from them. [...] The report concluded that Israeli authorities were aware that [...] "physical coercion and mistreatment" [...] probably had been used to obtain the confessions.|$|R
50|$|Cold {{shrink tubing}} {{is an open}} ended rubber sleeve, made {{primarily}} from rubber elastomers with high-performance physical properties, that has been factory expanded or pre-stretched, and assembled onto a supporting removable plastic core. Cold shrink tubing shrinks upon removal of the supporting core during the installation process and the electrician slides the tube over the <b>cable</b> to <b>be</b> <b>terminated</b> and unwinds the core, causing the tube to collapse down, or contract, in place.|$|R
50|$|Connecting two {{high-voltage}} cables {{with one}} another poses two main problems. First, the outer conducting layers in both <b>cables</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>terminated</b> without causing a field concentration, similar as with {{the making of a}} cable terminal. Secondly, a field free space shall be created where the cut-down cable insulation and the connector of the two conductors safely can be accommodated. These problems have been solved by NKF in Delft in 1965 by introducing a device called bi-manchet.|$|R
40|$|Current Network {{devices have}} been {{implemented}} with sensors that automatically detect and accordingly manage the various functional cables of a twisted pair cable. This paper research into the effectof randomly arranging twisted pair cables on communication and the complications associated with manual termination with RJ 45 connectors. Different sets of unshielded twisted pair <b>cables</b> <b>were</b> randomly <b>terminated.</b> These <b>cables</b> <b>were</b> used to set up communication channel between homogeneous and heterogeneous network devices. With the help of communication detection mechanism and a Java desktopapplication implemented with Java SE, the quality of communication was analyzed. The manual termination processes were also closely monitored and analyzed...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanical}} system is disclosed to deploy an antenna {{on a support}} which may, for example, be a spacecraft. A series of telescoping tubes are nested one within the other when the antenna is in a retracted stowed position. The outermost tube is rigidly attached to the support and the inner tubes are latched in the stowed position by a caging mechanism. The antenna is driven toward a deployed position by a dual motor driven <b>cable</b> which <b>is</b> <b>terminated</b> in a driving tube {{at the lower end}} of the innermost tube, from whence the <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> trained about pulleys at the tops and bottoms of successively large tubes of the antenna. The <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> wound on a drum {{at the lower end of}} the antenna and coaxial therewith. During deployment of the antenna, the drum rotates, thereby reeling in the deployment cable. The initial movement of the cable causes cam releasing of the latches in the caging device. Thereafter, the antenna tubes are extended until the final deployed position of the antenna is reached. A ratchet attached to the drum prevents reverse rotation of the drum and locks the antenna in the deployed position until the ratchet is released...|$|R
50|$|The RDM {{protocol}} and the RDM physical layer {{were designed to}} be compatible with legacy equipment. All compliant legacy DMX512 receivers should be usable in mixed systems with an RDM controller (console) and RDM responders (receivers). DMX receivers and RDM responders {{can be used with}} a legacy DMX console to form a DMX512 only system. From a user’s point of view the system layout is very similar to a DMX system. The controller is placed {{at one end of the}} main cable segment. The <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> run receiver to receiver in a daisy-chain fashion. RDM enabled splitters are used the same way DMX splitters would be. The far end (the non console or splitter end) of a <b>cable</b> segment should <b>be</b> <b>terminated.</b>|$|R
40|$|Different {{types of}} {{sensors can be}} used for on-line {{detection}} and localisation of PDs in medium voltage cables. These sensors can be placed on different locations in the substa-tions where the <b>cable</b> under test <b>is</b> <b>terminated.</b> Both aspects have a significant influence on the measured signals. In this paper both capacitive and inductive sensors are briefly evaluated, especially concerning their applicability for on-line measurements. Further-more, when the sensors are applied on-line, it is essential to realize which signals are being measured. Especially when three-phase belted <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> being measured, the situation differs considerably from off-line situations. When the <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> on-line, i. e. powered by the network itself, all three the phases are energized simultaneously. This means the PD pulses are propagating through two distinctive propagation modes: the Phase-to-Phase (PP) mode and the Shield-to-Phase (SP) mode. In this paper the differ-ent possible locations in a substation for placing sensors are discussed, with respect to the measured propagation modes, signal- and interference sensitivity, safety and practi-cal applicability. Field measurements confirm the findings...|$|R
50|$|The {{individually}} sheathed {{construction has}} the advantage that individually cores can easily <b>be</b> <b>terminated</b> to individual connectors {{at the ends of}} the <b>cable.</b> Its disadvantage <b>is</b> that the size and weight of the <b>cable</b> <b>are</b> increased. When a cable without individual sheaths has to <b>be</b> <b>terminated</b> to multiple connectors, it is common practice to create individual sheaths using heat-shrinkable tubing.|$|R
50|$|The keyset <b>cables</b> <b>were</b> {{typically}} routed to a {{wiring closet}} or wiring panel where the Key Service Unit (KSU) was installed and <b>were</b> <b>terminated</b> on a 66 type punch block, typically a model 66M1-50. Each of these blocks could accept two 25-pair cables for termination.|$|R
40|$|Flat {{electrical}} <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> lightweight, flexible over wide temperature range, withstands {{continuous exposure}} {{to high levels}} of nuclear radiation, and can carry high currents with minimum of temperature rise. Its magnetic cleanliness is equal to or better than twisted pair of wires, and it can <b>be</b> <b>terminated</b> in conventional electrical connector...|$|R
5000|$|The IT {{industry}} needs data <b>cables</b> to <b>be</b> added, moved, or removed {{many times}} during {{the life of the}} installation. It is usual practice to install [...] "fixed cables" [...] between cabling closets or cabinets. These <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> contained in <b>cable</b> trays etc., and <b>are</b> <b>terminated</b> at each end onto patch panels in the communications cabinet or outlets at the desktop. The circuits are then interconnected to the final destination using patch cords.|$|R
50|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of {{reversed}} connections one edge of the <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> usually marked with a red stripe. By convention the edge with the stripe is connected to pin 1 on the connector. This method of identification <b>is</b> fine for <b>cables</b> that just consist of two or more IDC connectors with every connector connecting to every wire, but is somewhat less helpful when individual wires or small groups of wires must <b>be</b> <b>terminated</b> separately.|$|R
50|$|When star-quad <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> {{used for}} a single {{balanced}} line, such as professional audio applications and two-wire telephony, two non-adjacent conductors <b>are</b> <b>terminated</b> together {{at both ends of}} the cable, and the other two conductors <b>are</b> also <b>terminated</b> together. Interference picked up by the cable arrives as a virtually perfect common mode signal, which is easily removed by a coupling transformer or differential amplifier. The combined benefits of twisting, differential signalling, and quadrupole pattern give outstanding noise immunity, especially advantageous for low signal level applications such as long microphone cables, even when installed very close to a power <b>cable.</b> It <b>is</b> particularly beneficial compared to twisted pair when AC magnetic field sources are in close proximity, for example a stage cable that can lie against an inline power transformer.|$|R
50|$|KCOM's Fibre to the {{premises}} product, Lightstream, requires a new fibre-optic <b>cable</b> <b>be</b> laid to each premises that <b>is</b> <b>terminated</b> {{inside the home}} in an ONT. A router is then plugged into the ONT to distribute the service throughout the home. As of April 2015, the service offers software limited speeds of up to 250Mbit/s downstream bandwidth. Due to delivery being FTTH greater speeds are a formality and fuelled by market expectation and not network restriction.|$|R
50|$|The early flat ribbon <b>cables</b> <b>were</b> {{used in the}} mainframe-computer industry, on card readers, card-punching machines, {{and tape}} machines. Subsequently, ribbon <b>cables</b> <b>were</b> {{manufactured}} {{by a number of}} different companies, including 3M. Methods and materials were developed to simplify and reduce the cost of ribbon cables, by standardizing the design and spacing of the wires, and the thickness of the insulation, so that they could <b>be</b> easily <b>terminated</b> through the use of insulation-displacement connectors (IDC). Due to the simplicity of ribbon cables, their low profile, and low cost due to standardization, ribbon <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> used today in most computers, printers, and many electronic devices.|$|R
5000|$|... 100BASE-TX is the {{predominant}} form of Fast Ethernet, and runs over two wire-pairs inside a category 5 or above cable. Like 10BASE-T, the active pairs {{in a standard}} connection <b>are</b> <b>terminated</b> on pins 1, 2, 3 and 6. Since a typical category 5 cable contains 4 pairs, it can support two 100BASE-TX links with a wiring adaptor. <b>Cabling</b> <b>is</b> conventional wired to TIA/EIA-568-B's termination standards, T568A or T568B. This places the active pairs on the orange and green pairs (canonical second and third pairs).|$|R
40|$|Transient {{characteristic}} of a current injection <b>cable,</b> which <b>is</b> used for a surge measurement, is investigated in this paper. Measurements are carried out in order to confirm the accuracy of a numerical simulation {{by means of a}} circuit analysis program, Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP). The measured results are physically explained by theoretical calculations using travelling wave theory. The characteristic impedance of the current injection <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> finally calculated. The results show that the recursive convolution line model, which is known as Semlyen 2 ̆ 7 s frequency-dependent line model, can be used to represent the current injection cable. If the core <b>is</b> <b>terminated</b> by a low impedance and the sheath is open-circuited at the receiving-end, an earth-return mode is generated by a reflection at the receiving end from a coaxial mode component...|$|R
5000|$|The {{main point}} of ribbon <b>cables</b> <b>is</b> to allow mass {{termination}} to specially designed IDC connectors {{in which the}} ribbon <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> forced onto a row of sharp forked contacts. (The phrase [...] "IDC connector" [...] is widely used, {{even though it is}} redundant—an example of RAS syndrome.) Most commonly termination is done {{at both ends of the}} cable, although sometimes (for example, when making a lead that needs to change wiring between the two connectors) only one end will <b>be</b> IDC <b>terminated,</b> with the other end being terminated in a regular crimp or solder-bucket connection. Although it is sometimes possible to dismantle and re-use IDC connectors, they are not designed to allow this to be done easily.|$|R
