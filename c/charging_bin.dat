40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this dissertation is the first evaluation of two-dimensional charge coupled devices (CCDs) for low light level analytical spectroscopy. The electro-optical properties of several unique two-dimensional CCDs are evaluated, including quantum efficiency, detector read noise, linearity, dynamic range, dark current, and blooming. Theoretical models describing the sensitivity and dynamic range of CCDs on a single detector element basis are developed. Based on this model and {{the characteristics of a}} CCD detector system built for this research, it is shown that a single detector element of a CCD has comparable or superior sensitivity than the most sensitive single channel detectors. The results of the CCD detector system applied to fluorescence, emission, absorption, and time and spatially resolved spectroscopies are presented. The <b>charge</b> <b>binning</b> readout mode, which combines charge packets from several detector elements into a single charge packet, is critically evaluated for increasing the sensitivity and dynamic range of spectroscopic measurements. Equations describing the sensitivity and dynamic range enhancement achieved through <b>charge</b> <b>binning</b> are derived and experimentally verified in atomic emission and molecular fluorescence spectroscopies. The results of operating the CCD in two specialized readout modes developed in this research termed high-speed framing and spectral framing are presented. High speed framing allows the CCD to rapidly acquire two-dimensional images with high sensitivity. The spectral framing readout mode enables the CCD to record time-resolved spectra at a rate of approximately one spectra every two microseconds with great sensitivity. The design and evaluation of a CCD based molecular fluorescence spectrograph using a mercury pen lamp excitation source is described. The limit of detection for anthracene is 1 x 10 ⁻¹²M and is superior to the results obtained by fluorometers employing laser sources and photomultiplier detection. The design and evaluation of a spatially resolving spectrograph for absorbance spectroscopy of optically dense films is presented.

40|$|A {{generalized}} formulation for coagulation of {{charged particles}} {{is presented in}} this paper. The governing equations can be solved semi-implicitly {{for a number of}} discrete size and <b>charge</b> <b>bins.</b> The computationally efficient mechanism gives volume and charge conserved solution with time. A distinct way of handling electrostatic dispersion in dynamic model has been used in this work. The scheme has been tested for charged, nebulized aerosol particles by model studies and also compared with experimental observations. The model simulated results show that charge can significantly affect the coagulation dynamics if charge level is higher than the Boltzmann equilibrium charge limit for less than 1 mu m particles. It was found that for the bipolar charge case, there was a significant effect on the enhancement of the coagulation process. For the case of unipolar charge, electrostatic dispersion was seen {{to play a role in}} the depletion of number concentration. The model was then validated against results of six controlled experiments in which electrical low pressure impactor (ELPI) was used for measurement of charge and number size distribution. Our model results were found to be in reasonable agreement with observed values. The developed model is fast (independent of time step) and numerically stable.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a CMOS image sensor which can implement the charge domain interlacing principle. Inspired by the shared amplifier pixel structure {{and based on}} a pinned photodiode four transistor (4 T) structure, two innovative pixel designs combined with two different readout directions are presented. These novel pixels are designed to fit the charge domain interlacing principle, which used the <b>charge</b> <b>binning</b> technology in the field integration mode of interlaced scan to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensor. To realize this working principle and compared it with other working modes, a programmable universal image sensor peripheral circuit is designed for controlling and driving the pixel array in the most flexible and most efficient way. As a result, the designed sensor can be used {{not only in the}} progressive scan mode, frame integration interlaced scan, and voltage domain interlacing mode but also in the charge domain interlacing mode. This is a very unique feature for CMOS image sensors, and without the shared pixel concept, charge domain interlacing was only possible with CCDs. The proposed image sensor is implemented in TSMC 0. 18 um 1 P 6 M CMOS technology. Some preliminary measurement results of the chip are shown to prove the functional correctness of the image sensor.

40|$|Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs) {{optically}} coupled to scintillation crystals {{can be used}} to construct high resolution gamma cameras. Previously, several groups have reported intrinsic detector spatial resolutions below 100 microns. When the CCD images can be read out fast enough, the energy and interaction position of individual gamma quanta can be estimated by a real-time image analysis of the scintillation light flashes. The Electron-Multiplying CCD (EMCCD) is well-suited for fast read out, since even at high frame rates it has extremely low readout noise. However, due to the often very low light levels present in scintillation gamma cameras, further reduction of noise is desirable. Here, the EMCCD is {{optically coupled}} to a 1000 - µ-thick columnar CsI(Tl) crystal for Tc- 99 m and I- 125 imaging. We investigate noise reduction through summing of signals in pixels before the gain register and readout circuit of the EMCCD (“pixel binning”). We compare the energy and spatial resolution, photopeak efficiency (PE) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of an EMCCD-based gamma camera for the case of binning vs. non-binning. When pixels were read out simultaneously in groups of 4 the spatial resolution is slightly worse in the direction of binning, but the number of false-positive counts resulting from background noise for I- 125 was reduced by 74 % compared to the no binning case. We conclude that the use of <b>charge</b> <b>binning</b> when reading out EMCCDs may significantly improve the energy spectra and noise properties of CCD-based high-resolution gamma cameras.

The classical Arabic term is “Tahlil”; the Persians call the cry “Kil.” It is peculiar to women, and is formed {{by raising the}} voice to its highest pitch, vibrating {{it at the same}} time by rolling the tongue, whose modulations express now joy, now grief. To my ear it always resembled the brain-piercing notes of a fife. Dr. Buchanan likens it to a serpent uttering human sounds. The “unsavoury comparison,” however, may owe its origin to the circumstance that Dr. Buchanan heard it at the orgies of Jagannath. [FN#2] As an Indian is called “Miyan,” sir, an elderly Indian becomes “bara Miyan,” great or ancient sir. I shall have occasion to speak at a future period of these Indians at Meccah. [FN#3] “Sitt al-Kabirah,” or simply “Al-Kabirah,” the Great Lady, is the title given to the mistress of. the house. [FN#4] This hill bounds Meccah on the East. According to many Moslems, Adam, with his wife and his son Seth, lie buried in a cave here. Others place his tomb at Muna; the Majority at Najaf. The early Christians had a tradition that our first parents were interred under Mount Calvary; the Jews place their grave near Hebron. Habil (Abel), it is well known, is supposed to be entombed at Damascus; and Kabil (Cain) rests at last under Jabal Shamsan, the highest wall of the Aden crater, where he and his progeny, tempted by Iblis, erected the first fire-temple. It certainly deserves to be the sepulchre of the first murderer. The worship, however, was probably imported from India, where Agni (the fire god) was, as the Vedas prove, the object of man’s earliest adoration. [FN#5] The popular legend of this gate is, that when Abraham and his son were ordered to rebuild the Ka’abah, they found the spot occupied by an old woman. She consented to remove her house on condition that the key of the new temple should be entrusted to her and to her descendants for ever and ever. The origin of this is, that Benu Shaybah means the “sons of an old woman” as well as “descendants of Shaybah.” And history tells us that the Benu Shaybah are derived from one Shaybah (bin Osman, bin Talhah, bin Shaybah, bin Talhah, bin Abd al-Dar), who was sent by Mu’awiyah to make some alterations in the Ka’abah. According to others, the Ka’abah key was committed to the <b>charge</b> of Osman <b>bin</b> Talhah by the Prophet. [FN#6] The Moslem in circumambulation presents his left shoulder; the Hindu’s Pradakshina consists in walking round with the right side towards the fane or idol. Possibly the former may be a modification of the latter, which would appear to be the original form of the rite. Its conjectural significance is an imitation of the procession of the heavenly bodies, the motions of the spheres, and the dances of the angels. These are also imitated in the circular whirlings of the Darwayshes. And Al-Shahristani informs us that the Arab philosophers believed this sevenfold circumambulation to be symbolical of the motion of the planets round the sun. It was adopted by the Greeks and Romans, whose Ambarvalia and Amburbalia appear to be eastern superstitions, introduced by Numa, or by the priestly line of princes, into their pantheism. And our processions round the parish preserve the form of the ancient rites, whose life is long since fled. Moslem moralists have not failed to draw spiritual food from this mass of materialism. “To circuit the Bayt Ullah,” said the Pir Raukhan (As. Soc. vol. xi. and Dabistan, vol. iii., “Miyan Bayazid”), “and to be free from wickedness, and crime, and quarrels, is the duty enjoined by religion. But to circuit the house of the friend of Allah (i.e. the heart), to combat bodily propensities, and to worship the Angels, is the business of the (mystic) path.” Thus Sa’adi, in his sermons,—which remind the Englishman of “poor Yorick,”—“He who travels to the Ka’abah on foot makes a circuit of the Ka’abah, but he who performs the pilgrimage of the Ka’abah in his heart is encircled by the Ka’abah.” And the greatest Moslem divines sanction this visible representation of an invisible and heavenly shrine, by declaring that, without a material medium, it is impossible for man to worship the Eternal Spirit. [FN#7] The Mutawwif, or Dalil, is the guide at Meccah. [FN#8] In A.D. 1674 some wretch smeared the Black Stone with impurity, and every one who kissed it retired with a sullied beard. The Persians, says Burckhardt, were suspected of this sacrilege, and now their ill-fame has spread far; at Alexandria they were described to me as a people who defile the Ka’abah. It is scarcely necessary to say that a Shi’ah, as well as a Sunni, would look upon such an action with lively horror. The people of Meccah, however, like the Madani, have turned the circumstance to their own advantage, and make an occasional “avanie.” Thus, nine or ten years ago, on the testimony of a boy who swore that he saw the inside of the Ka’abah defiled by a Persian, they rose up, cruelly beat the schismatics, and carried them off to their peculiar quarter the Shamiyah, forbidding their ingress to the Ka’abah.
