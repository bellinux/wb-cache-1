5|$|In 1993, Jackson {{was accused}} {{of child sexual abuse}} by Evan <b>Chandler,</b> on behalf of his then-13-year-old child, Jordan <b>Chandler.</b> To the father's disapproval and concern, his son had become friends with the {{musician}} in May 1992. Allegedly under the influence of a controversial sedative administered by Evan <b>Chandler,</b> a dentist, his son said that Jackson had touched his penis. Evan <b>Chandler</b> was tape-recorded threatening to damage the singer's music career, and engaged Jackson in unsuccessful negotiations to resolve the issue with a financial settlement. Jordan <b>Chandler</b> then told a psychiatrist and later police that he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral sex. Jackson settled a civil suit out of court with the <b>Chandler</b> family and their legal team for $22,000,000 in January 1994. After Jordan <b>Chandler</b> refused to testify in the criminal proceedings, the state closed its criminal investigation citing lack of evidence, and Jackson was not charged with a crime. Jordan <b>Chandler</b> later admitted to lying. After Jackson's death, Evan <b>Chandler</b> committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} between <b>Chandler</b> and Laffoon led to factionalism {{within the state}} Democratic Party. When no strong gubernatorial candidate emerged from the <b>Chandler</b> faction in 1939, <b>Chandler</b> threw his support behind Johnson. John Y. Brown, Sr. announced he would challenge Johnson in the primary. This solidified the <b>Chandler</b> faction's support, as Brown was {{an outspoken critic of}} the <b>Chandler</b> administration. Brown gained the support of <b>Chandler</b> critics, notably former governor Ruby Laffoon, Tom Rhea, Earle C. Clements, and Alben Barkley. He further garnered the support of the United Mine Workers and labor boss John L. Lewis. It was to no avail, as Johnson defeated Brown in the primary by over 33,000 votes to secure the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.|$|E

5|$|A multi-sport athlete {{during his}} college days at Transylvania College, <b>Chandler</b> briefly {{considered}} {{a career in}} professional baseball before deciding to pursue a law degree. After graduation, he entered politics and was elected as a Democrat to the Kentucky Senate in 1928. Two years later, he was elected lieutenant governor, serving under Governor Ruby Laffoon. <b>Chandler</b> and Laffoon disagreed {{on the issue of}} instituting a state sales tax and when <b>Chandler,</b> the presiding officer in the state senate, worked to block the legislation, Laffoon's allies in the General Assembly stripped him of many of his statutory powers. The tax then passed by a narrow margin. Knowing that Laffoon would try to select his own successor at the Democratic nominating convention, <b>Chandler</b> waited until Laffoon left the state—leaving <b>Chandler</b> as acting governor—and called the legislature into session to enact a mandatory primary election bill. The bill passed, and in the ensuing primary, <b>Chandler</b> defeated Laffoon's choice, Thomas Rhea. He then went on to defeat Republican King Swope by the largest margin of victory for a Kentucky gubernatorial race to that time. As governor, <b>Chandler</b> oversaw the repeal of the sales tax, replacing the lost revenue with new excise taxes and the state's first income tax. He also enacted a major reorganization of state government, realizing significant savings for the state. He used these savings to pay off the state debt and improve the state's education and transportation systems.|$|E
5|$|Back in the present, <b>Chandler</b> apologizes to Monica. Rachel reveals that's not {{the story}} she was {{referring}} to. The flashbacks continue to 1988; Ross and <b>Chandler</b> arrive for dinner {{to find that}} Monica has slimmed down, and <b>Chandler</b> now finds her attractive. Monica tells Rachel {{that she wants to}} humiliate <b>Chandler</b> for calling her fat, so Rachel suggests tricking him into taking off his clothes. Monica tries to seduce <b>Chandler</b> by rubbing various objects, including a knife, against her skin. She drops the knife and severs his toe. He is rushed to hospital to have it reattached but, in the commotion, Monica mixes up the digit with a carrot. In the present, <b>Chandler</b> becomes upset after learning that he had lost his toe because he called Monica fat, and angrily leaves. When Monica comes by his apartment seeking his forgiveness by putting a turkey on her head, he inadvertently tells her he loves {{her for the first time}} in their relationship. A tag scene shows another of Phoebe's past life memories as she serves in a World War I field hospital and again lost an arm.|$|E
5|$|Barkley, {{recently}} {{chosen as}} Senate Majority Leader {{by a single}} vote, was {{a strong supporter of}} President Roosevelt and the New Deal. <b>Chandler</b> identified with the more conservative southern Democrats who, wary of Roosevelt and his New Deal, sought to gain control of the party ahead of the 1940 presidential election. Because Roosevelt was very popular in Kentucky, <b>Chandler</b> was put in the awkward position of expressing personal support of the president while opposing his hand-picked leader in the Senate and his New Deal legislation. In April, polls showed Barkley ahead of <b>Chandler</b> by a 2-to-1 margin, and the May 3 primary victory of New Deal Florida Senator Claude Pepper finally persuaded <b>Chandler</b> to abandon his attacks of the program.|$|E

5|$|During the 1946 postseason, rumors {{began to}} swirl that Yankees owner Larry MacPhail was {{lobbying}} Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher {{to leave the}} Dodgers and manage the Yankees.

In the offseason, <b>Chandler</b> and Durocher had a meeting wherein <b>Chandler</b> counseled Durocher to abandon his gambling. Branch Rickey charged <b>Chandler</b> with maintaining a double standard, however, when the commissioner took no action after seeing MacPhail with two known gamblers at a Yankees–Dodgers preseason exhibition in Havana, Cuba. MacPhail then signed two Dodgers assistant coaches—Chuck Dressen and John Corriden—as aides to Yankee manager Bucky Harris while they were still employed by the Dodgers. <b>Chandler</b> suspended Dressen for 30 days and levied $2,000 fines against MacPhail and the Yankees.|$|E

5|$|Eager {{to augment}} {{his power and}} angered by Roosevelt's and Barkley's refusal to accept his {{suggestion}} of appointing Logan to the Supreme Court, <b>Chandler</b> did not attend a long-planned dinner in Barkley's honor on January 22, 1938; instead, he held an event of his own at Louisville's exclusive Pendennis Club at which he alluded to his intentions of challenging Barkley during the upcoming Democratic senatorial primary. Barkley officially announced his re-election bid the following day. The death of another federal judge on January 26 provided a second opportunity for Roosevelt to appoint Senator Logan to a judgeship and appease <b>Chandler,</b> but Logan refused to consider the appointment. Following a January 31 meeting in Washington, D.C. between Roosevelt and <b>Chandler,</b> during which Roosevelt urged <b>Chandler</b> to put his senatorial ambitions on hold, <b>Chandler</b> was encouraged by his political mentor, Virginia's Harry F.
