25|$|Some {{ecological}} economists prioritise adding {{natural capital}} {{to the typical}} <b>capital</b> <b>asset</b> analysis of land, labor, and financial capital. These ecological economists then use tools from mathematical economics as in mainstream economics, but may apply them more closely to the natural world. Whereas mainstream economists tend to be technological optimists, ecological economists are inclined to be technological sceptics. They reason that the natural world has a limited carrying capacity and that its resources may run out. Since destruction of important environmental resources could be practically irreversible and catastrophic, ecological economists are inclined to justify cautionary measures based on the precautionary principle.|$|E
40|$|Although {{some efforts}} have been made over the last 20 years, {{governmental}} <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> are still the subject of many unresolved questions. After presenting {{an overview of the}} current differing accounting standards or research efforts with respect to governmental <b>capital</b> <b>assets,</b> this paper analyses the criteria of recognition, valuation and disclosure of <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> in the reform of three kinds of Flemish governments. Their reformed accounting system is compared with IPSAS 17 (IFAC), being an important internationally driven milestone considering <b>capital</b> <b>assets.</b> An important issue is the lack of a conceptual framework regarding <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> and an attempt is made to canalise the existing ideas. An important issue in governmental accounting is the first balance sheet approach when accounting reforms are implemented. This study indicates that the lack of distinguishing a separate accounting framework for <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> with respect to the first balance sheet, causes a lot of confusion in the discussion about accounting standards. Finally, the paper aims at providing experiences in analysing governmental accounting standards for <b>capital</b> <b>assets.</b> The examination of the adoption reveals that the accounting reforms usually do {{not take into account the}} specific governmental characteristics of <b>capital</b> <b>assets.</b> governmental accounting, <b>capital</b> <b>assets,</b> governmental assets, accounting reform, accounting framework...|$|R

25|$|A {{capital gain}} {{should not be}} {{confused}} with a dividend. Generally, a capital gain occurs where a <b>capital</b> <b>asset</b> is sold for an amount greater than the amount of its cost at the time the investment was purchased. A dividend is a parsing out a share of the profits, and is taxed at the dividend tax rate. If there is an increase of value of stock, and a shareholder chooses to sell the stock, the shareholder will pay a tax on capital gains (often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income). If a holder of the stock chooses to not participate in the buyback, the price of the holder's shares could rise (as well as it could fall), but the tax on these gains is delayed until the sale of the shares.|$|E

See, for example, the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in United States v.

40|$|Local {{governments in}} Sweden execute {{extensive}} volumes of capital investments. The volume of <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> in for profit organisations {{is limited by}} profitability criteria. Local municipalities are not for profit organisations where profitability criteria are subordinated. This paper investigates explanations of variation in development {{of the volume of}} <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> in Swedish local municipalities between 1999 - 2008. In the first step four cases were performed to generate eight suggestions for explanations. Hypothesises were generated by combining the suggested explanations with a new political economy framework containing four assumptions. A national data set of 288 (of total 290) Swedish local municipalities was used in a multiple linear regression analysis. The regression model include five variables and explains 31 percentage of the variation. An increasing volume of <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> could be explained by population growth, a high volume of <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> per capita {{at the beginning of the}} period, high solidity at the beginning of the period, an increasing level of charges and high political stability with few majority changes.

2500|$|On {{the other}} side, the <b>capital</b> <b>asset</b> pricing model is {{considered}} a [...] "demand side" [...] model.

2500|$|All {{sorts of}} {{differences}} occur in valuation practices used by business (historic cost, current replacement value, current sale value etc.) affecting fair value and GAAP-based accounting (among many other issues, if {{the profitability of}} a <b>capital</b> <b>asset</b> falls, {{the market value of}} the <b>capital</b> <b>asset</b> itself will fall as well, in response – irrespective of whether it is a physical asset or a financial asset, and irrespective of its acquisition cost; this reduces the fall of the profit rate). The valuations made are themselves influenced by the way price inflation is actually calculated using price indexes. Jochen Hartwig found that the divergence in growth rates of real GDP between the U.S. and the EU since 1997 [...] "can be explained almost entirely in terms of changes to deflation methods that have been introduced in the U.S. after 1997, but not – or only to a very limited extent – in Europe".

2500|$|The APT {{along with}} the <b>capital</b> <b>asset</b> pricing model (CAPM) {{is one of two}} {{influential}} theories on asset pricing. The APT differs from the CAPM in that it is less restrictive in its assumptions. It allows for an explanatory (as opposed to statistical) model of asset returns. It assumes that each investor will hold a unique portfolio with its own particular array of betas, as opposed to the identical [...] "market portfolio". In some ways, the CAPM can be considered a [...] "special case" [...] of the APT in that the securities market line represents a single-factor model of the asset price, where beta is exposed to changes in value of the market.|$|E

50|$|Typically {{what happens}} in a severe {{economic}} crisis is that the real cost structure of production is realigned with market prices. In Marx's terms, productivity growth has changed product-values in different sectors, but it is only after quite some time that prices adjust to changed underlying values. In that case, devalorisation may occur quite rapidly: <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> are suddenly worth less, and as soon as <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> are no longer utilised and maintained by living human labour (because of unemployment), the value of those <b>capital</b> <b>assets</b> begins to deteriorate. In the end, the total withdrawal of human labour leaves nothing but a ghost town.|$|R
2500|$|The {{husbandry}} system of water buffalo {{depends on the}} purpose {{for which they are}} bred and maintained. Most of them are kept by people who work on small farms in family units. Their buffalo live in very close association with them, and are often their greatest <b>capital</b> <b>asset.</b> The women and girls in India generally look after the milking buffalo while the men and boys are concerned with the working animals. Throughout Asia, they are commonly tended by children who are often seen leading or riding their charges to wallowing places. Water buffalo are the ideal animals for work in the deep mud of paddy fields because of their large hooves and flexible foot joints. They are often referred to as [...] "the living tractor of the East". It probably is possible to plough deeper with buffalo than with either oxen or horses. They are the most efficient and economical means of cultivation of small fields. In most rice-producing countries, they are used for threshing and for transporting the sheaves during the rice harvest. They provide power for oilseed mills, sugarcane presses, and devices for raising water. They are widely used as pack animals, and in India and Pakistan also for heavy haulage. In their invasions of Europe, the Turks used buffalo for hauling heavy battering rams. Their dung is used as a fertilizer, and as a fuel when dried.|$|E
