The Oil-Climate Index (OCI) is a metric {{that takes into account}} the total life-cycle Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions of individual oils [...] from upstream extraction to midstream refining to downstream end use. It offers a powerful, yet user-friendly, tool that allows investors, policymakers, industry, the public, and other stakeholders to compare crudes and assess their climate consequences both before development decisions are made as well as once operations are in progress. The Oil-Climate Index will also inform oil and climate policy making...|$|R

5000|$|Starting {{from the}} Moscow theater hostage crisis in 2002, Russia {{was faced with}} {{increased}} levels of Islamist terrorism. The FSB, being the main agency responsible for counter-terrorist operations, was in the front line {{in the fight against}} terror. During the Moscow theater siege and the Beslan school siege, FSB's Spetsnaz units Alpha Group and Vympel {{played a key role in}} the hostage release operations. However, their performance was criticised due to the high number of hostage casualties. In 2006, the FSB scored a major success in its counter-terrorist efforts when it successfully killed Shamil Basayev, the mastermind behind the Beslan tragedy and several other high-profile terrorist acts. According to the FSB, the operation was planned over six months and made possible due to the FSB's increased activities in foreign countries that were supplying arms to the terrorists. Basayev was tracked via the surveillance of this arms trafficking. Basayev and other militants were preparing to carry out a terrorist attack in Ingushetia when FSB agents destroyed their convoy; 12 militants were killed. During the last years of the Vladimir Putin's second presidency (2006-2008), terrorist attacks in Russia dwindled, falling from 257 in 2005 to 48 in 2007.
