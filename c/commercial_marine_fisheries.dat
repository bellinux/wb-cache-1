40|$|Jamaica‘s {{industrial}} fishery for queen conch (Strombus gigas) {{has produced a}} substantial amount of much-needed foreign exchange and for at least 10 years has been the most valuable component of all <b>commercial</b> <b>marine</b> <b>fisheries</b> activities. Since its inception in 1990 it has grown tremendously and may now be at some risk of collapse, due to problems including, among other factors, overfishing, poor enforcement, foreign poaching and under-reporting of catches. This paper examines and analyzes the problems relating to management of the conch fishery and speculates on its future. The main problems are overfishing by licensed fishers who take more than permitted, and serious poaching by industrial vessels mainly from Honduras, which exploit poor high seas enforcement by Jamaican authorities. For nearly two years the official fishery was closed due to legal issues. During closures, considerable foreign poaching occurred. The paper suggests that increased roles for the coast guard, continued quot...|$|E

Fisheries offices formed eight distinct clusters organized by similarities in geographic location, species-group composition, and coastal habitat type. Five of the eight clusters comprised offices from the same geographic region and coastal ecosystem, and the other three clusters contained the largest industrial fishing ports in NW Mexico.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{contribution}} of fish spawning aggregations and aggregating species to <b>commercial</b> <b>marine</b> <b>fisheries</b> in the Gulf of California, we: (1) investigated associations between the timing of spawning aggregations and monthly trends in commercial landings and ex-vessel revenues for aggregating reef fishes in the southwest Gulf of California and (2) compared present (2000 - 2005) and past (1956 - 1961) landings of aggregating species groups from the entire Gulf. Species known to form seasonal spawning aggregations comprised the eight most important commercial reef fish fisheries of the southwest Gulf with respect to landings and ex-vessel revenues, and three of these species increased in annual landings between 1999 and 2007. Peaks in mean monthly landings and revenues for five of eight aggregating species coincided with the timing of their spawning aggregations, whereas commercial fisheries for the remaining three species did not specifically target spawning aggregation periods. Comparisons {{of past and present}} landings showed an expansion of targeted species groups, increased landings for most aggregating species groups, and declines in the landings of several large-bodied species groups. Our results suggest that targeted management of spawning aggregations is needed for some but not all species, assessments on the interaction between fisheries and spawning aggregations are needed for most species, and restrictions on certain gear types are necessary to create sustainable fisheries for aggregating fishes in the Gulf. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Rising human global population, {{appetite}} for seafood, {{and the effects}} of climate change have pushed <b>commercial</b> <b>marine</b> <b>fisheries</b> around the globe onto trajectories that are chillingly unsustainable. Input from fishermen on what it means to have a “sustainable fishery” is often absent or ignored. Some commercial fisheries are lauded for their sustainability. This study looked at the successful case of the Bristol Bay sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) commercial fishery to determine whether, how, and why Bristol Bay commercial salmon fishermen conceptualize and work toward a more sustainable future for their fishery. Findings suggest that while fishermen care deeply about the sustainability of their fishery, they see their role in achieving that goal to be focused on advocating for their specific fishery to increase social capital, and taking steps to enhance the quality of their product to improve the economic viability of the fishery. In the course of the study, it became apparent that Bristol Bay fishermen were deeply concerned about and motivated to action by the proposed Pebble Mine. It was also revealed that fishermen might not have fully understood the roles and limitations of fishery managers when it came to public advocacy on issues like Pebble Mine. This may indicate that commercial fishermen and managers are on a course toward a toxic relationship, which threatens the sustainability of the fishery.

40|$|The island {{nature of}} the U. K. has led to it having {{a long history of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>marine</b> <b>fisheries,</b> with {{associated}} recreational fishing along and near to its extensive shoreline. In addition, an abundance of fresh waters provides extensive recreational fishing on rivers and lakes where catch-and-release is prevalent. Here, an overview is presented of these fisheries by describing their main features and then considering their historic and current threats and management. In the marine environment, a wide range of fish species is targeted but the Orders Gadiformes, Perciformes and Pleuronectiformes are particularly important. Far fewer species are available for exploitation in fresh waters, but the Orders Cypriniformes, Perciformes and Salmoniformes are fished extensively. In total, the U. K. has in excess of 3, 000, 000 recreational anglers. Significant environmental threats include physical habitat modification, acidification, chemical pollution, eutrophication, endocrine disrupters, nanoparticles, species introductions and climate change. Great scientific and management advances have been made such that most of the required aquatic biological management activities are now based on mature science and are in many cases now largely operational matters. In addition, the work of the U. K. statutory bodies for fisheries is increasingly supplemented by the efforts of more independent groups, including through citizen science. Ecosystem-based management is now commonplace and activities have expanded above and away from the water to include the management of anglers and other members of society. The U.

The published article is copyrighted by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. and can be found at: [URL] quota (IQ) management systems in <b>commercial</b> <b>marine</b> <b>fisheries</b> are highly diverse, differing in the security, durability and exclusivity of the harvesting privilege and the transferability of quota units. This diversity in the degree of harvest rights may influence the effectiveness of IQ fisheries to meet management objectives. We conducted a global meta-analysis of 167 stocks managed under IQs to test whether the strength of harvest rights impacts the conservation status of stocks in terms of catch, exploitation rate and biomass relative to management targets. We used non-parametric methods to assess non-linear relationships and linear regression models to explicitly consider interactions among predictors. Most IQ fisheries consistently met fleet-wide quota limits (94 % of stocks had recent catches below or within 10 % of quotas), but only 2 / 3 of IQ fisheries adhered to sustainable management targets for biomass and exploitation rate (68 % of stocks had exploitation rates below or within 10 % of targets and 63 % of stocks had biomass above or within 10 % of biomass targets). Strikingly, when exclusivity of the harvesting privilege was low, exploitation rates depended on whether IQ implementation was industry-driven (exploitation below targets) or government-mandated (exploitation above targets). At high levels of exclusivity, exploitation rates converged to just below management targets. Transferability of quota units was associated with stock biomass closer to and slightly above target levels than stocks with non-transferable quota. However, regional differences had the strongest effect on biomass, suggesting that other management or biological attributes of regional fishery systems have greater influence on marine populations...|$|E
40|$|Thesis(M. M. A.) [...] University of Washington, 1992 Most fisheries, marine or freshwater, {{commercial}} or recreational, catch other species {{in addition to}} the desired, or target, species. The catch of these additional species is termed incidental catch, or bycatch. Fishery bycatch is made up of a variety of animals, from cetaceans to seabirds to unmarketable fishes. Economic and fishery management considerations may cause the fisherman to keep the bycatch species for its commercial value, or, conversely, may require the bycatch be returned to the sea. In some fisheries, bycatch is retained because of its value in relation {{to the rest of the}} catch. For example, the target species may comprise only a small part of the catch, placing a reliance on the bycatch to provide a significant contribution to the overall revenue generated. In tropical fisheries for shrimp, the catch of shrimp is usually 10 percent or less of the total, whereas the bycatch of finfish and other species, which are large in size and commercially valuable, are the principle component of the catch (Gulland 1983). In many fisheries, bycatch is discarded due to economic or management reasons. The lack of a market or suitable ex-vessel price may force discarding the bycatch. Such was the case with the bycatch of white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) in the gillnet and trap fishery for Columbia River salmon prior to commercial exploitation in the early 1880 s (Bricklemeyer et al. 1989). In trawl fisheries, several species are caught {{in addition to the}} target species, but only those with commercial value during open seasons may be retained. Consequendy, most of the bycatch of other species is discarded. Saila (1983) estimated the discards of all species in the world’s <b>commercial</b> <b>marine</b> <b>fisheries</b> to range from 12 to 20 billion pounds (0. 5 to almost 1 million metric tons) of sea life...|$|E
40|$|Bycatch from <b>marine</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>fisheries</b> {{has been}} {{regarded}} as a global conservation concern for decades. Fortunately, some headway {{has been made in}} mitigating bycatch problems in <b>marine</b> <b>fisheries.</b> Freshwater <b>commercial</b> fisheries, however, have been relatively understudied. Although freshwater yields comprise 11 % of the global commercial catch, bycatch research focusing on freshwater commercial fisheries represents only about 3 % of the total bycatch literature. This paucity of research is particularly alarming given that so many of the world’s threatened species live in freshwater. The limited literature that does exist includes examples of population declines attributed to commercial bycatch (e. g., the Yangtze River dolphin) and illustrates that bycatch is substantial in some systems (e. g., lake trout in Laurentian Great Lakes fisheries). Encouraging results from the marine realm can serve as models for bycatch research and development in freshwater and can lead to measurable gains in the conservation of freshwater ecosystems. We summarize existing work on inland bycatch in an effort to draw attention to this understated and understudied conservation problem...|$|R

40|$|Workshop {{participants}} (Appendix 1) focused {{discussions on}} the questions posed in the meeting outline and agenda (Appendix 2), in particular {{with a view to}} defining “success” and identifying elements of success in fisheries management. The workshop discussion was mainly based on <b>commercial</b> <b>marine</b> capture <b>fisheries,</b> although participants believe that the conclusions can be applied {{to a wide range of}} fisheries including subsistence and recreational fisheries. A sustainability framework for assessing success Assessing sustainability on three dimensions – ecological, economic, social – is a good approach to determining whether a fishery is well-managed. Success on all three dimensions would be required to consider a fishery well-managed. Participants in the fishery Since participation is a key element of success in fisheries management, it is essential at the outset to define the participants (or stakeholders) in the fishery being managed. Fish harvesters, Aboriginal people, processors and marketers, communities, people interested in sustainability and in society’s resources, may be considered participants in the fishery, depending on the local situation. Attention to terminology Workshop participants recognized that each individual brings his or her own experience to the table; in particular, individual interpretations of terminology may differ. Even relatively subtle differences in interpretation can lead to difficulties in reaching a shared understanding of issues and priorities. Such differences in experience and interpretation must be respected and allowed for in discussions of how to achieve success in fisheries management...|$|R
