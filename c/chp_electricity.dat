40|$|Renewable-energy {{sources and}} energy {{efficiency}} are important elements in Danish Energy Policy. The implementation of wind power and combined heat- and power production (CHP) have already led to substantial fuel savings, and both technologies {{are intended for}} further expansion in the coming decade. Today, approximately 50 % of both Danish electricity and heat demand are produced via CHP, and more than 15 % of the electricity demands are produced by wind turbines. However, the electricity production from these technologies is linked to fluctuations either in wind or in heat demands rather than fluctuations in demand for electricity. Consequently, the electricity production exceeds the demand during certain periods and creates a problem of "surplus production".

This study examines the potential of <b>CHP</b> <b>electricity</b> generation and heat pump electricity consumption in residential buildings to balance fluctuations of renewable energy generation in Germany’s future energy system.

40|$|Abstract Over {{the course}} of the 20 th century, the {{electrical}} power systems of industrialized economies have {{become one of the most}} complex systems created by mankind. In the same period, electricity made a transition from a novelty, to a convenience, to an advantage, and finally to an absolute necessity. World-wide electricity use has been ever-growing. The electricity infrastructure consists of two highlyinterrelated and complex subsystems for commodity trade and physical delivery. To ensure the infrastructure is up and running in the first place, the increasing electricity demand poses a serious threat. Additionally, there are a number of other trends that are forcing a change in infrastructure management. Firstly, there is a shift to intermittent sources: a larger share of renewables in the energy mix means a higher influence of weather patterns on generation. At the same time, introducing more combined heat and power generation (<b>CHP)</b> couples <b>electricity</b> production to heat demand patterns. Secondly, the location of electricity generation relative to the load centers is changing. Large-scale generation from wind is migrating towards and into the seas and oceans, away from the locations of high electricity demand. O...|$|R
30|$|However, {{wind power}} in China, {{particularly}} in Northeast China, {{is facing a}} serious problem of wind curtailment [7]. In 2015, the annual wind curtailment ratio of Jilin province was as high as 32 % [8]. The main reason is that more than 70 % of the heating load in winter is supplied by centralized coal-fired {{combined heat and power}} (<b>CHP)</b> units, the <b>electricity</b> generation of which is severely restricted by their heat load [9], leaving little space for integrating wind power. Consequently, even during the off-peak hours of winter, the CHP units still cannot reduce sufficient power generation {{in order to meet the}} heating demand. The strong coupling between power and heat load restricts the operational flexibility of CHP units and causes severe wind curtailment [10]. This restriction has become a bottleneck for the continual development of China’s wind power.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether and}} how Danish-style {{combined}} heat and power (CHP) and district heating (DH) can be implemented in the UK {{in the context of a}} liberalised electricity market. There is currently an absence, in the UK, of the Danish system of planning rules and also good tariffs for <b>CHP</b> <b>electricity</b> exports to the grid that led to the development of the Danish system of CHP and DH. However, there are some changes in UK planning practice that may help CHP and DH. These would need to be strengthened, but it is also the case that the way the liberalised electricity market operates in the UK effectively discriminates against small CHP plant selling their electricity to the grid. A Danish system of 'aggregating' CHP-DH plant using thermal stores could help to overcome this problem. However, an alternative strategy would be to establish feed-in tariffs for CHP units that are linked to DH modelled on the Danish 'triple tariff'. This could help the UK's long-term objective of absorbing high levels of fluctuating renewable energy sources. ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} year in Germany a great many {{political}} discussions have centered around the future direction of energy and climate policy. Due {{to a number of}} events related to energy prices, security of supply and climate change, it has been necessary to develop cornerstones for a new integrated energy and climate policy. To supplement this decision process, model-based scenarios were used. In this paper we introduce fuzzy constraints to obtain a better representation of political decision processes, in particular, to find compromises between often contradictory targets (e. g. economic, environmentally friendly and secure energy supply). A number of policy aims derived from a review of the ongoing political discussions were formulated as fuzzy constraints to explicitly include trade-offs between various targets. The result is an overall satisfaction level of about 60 % contingent upon the following restrictions: share of energy imports, share of biofuels, share of <b>CHP</b> <b>electricity,</b> CO 2 reduction target and use of domestic hard coal. The restrictions for the share of renewable electricity, share of renewable heat, energy efficiency and postponement of nuclear phase out have higher membership function values, i. e. they are not binding and therefore get done on the side.

40|$|This study {{applies the}} Total Site Heat Integration method, in {{conjunction}} with a detailed process and utility model, to investigate three methods to increase the energy efficiency of the utility supply system for milk powder production. Sequentially explored opportunities are: (1) increasing boiler efficiency through condensing economisers, (2) waste heat recovery from the chiller unit, and (3) Combined Heat and Power (<b>CHP)</b> for <b>electricity</b> production. The basis for the analysis is the anticipated future milk powder process design, which incorporates results from recent studies that have focused on improving the process design and integration of the heat treatment and evaporator systems and recovering heat from the spray dryer exhaust, which show a combined specific fuel consumption reduction of 29. 6 % and a relatively small increase in electricity use of 4. 5 %. To maximise boiler efficiency, the study concludes that a condensing economiser for the flue gas can be indirectly matched with heating fluidised bed air flows through the boiler condensate system, which results in specific fuel use reduction of 227 MJ/tp. Chiller waste heat can be upgraded and integrated as a heat source to replace the equivalent specific fuel use of 101 MJ/tp through integration with the site low temperature hot water loop. By designing the steam system to maximise electricity generation in a new turbine, results show that 51 % of the site’s electricity demand may be satisfied by CHP. The combined effect of implementing these three utility systems opportunities is a specific fuel use of 3, 868 MJ/tₚ, of which 530 MJ/tₚ result from electricity production, and a specific grid electricity demand of 113. 4 kWh/tₚ...|$|R

40|$|The {{improvement}} of energy efficiency {{is seen as}} one of the most promising measures for reducing global CO 2 emissions. However, the emission reduction potential may seem different from the industrial plant and policy-maker's perspectives. This paper evaluates the influences of process heat conservation on <b>CHP</b> <b>electricity</b> production, primary energy consumption and CO 2 emissions from both the mill site and national perspectives. The results indicate that heat conservation in an industrial process may lead to varying results in primary energy consumption and CO 2 emissions, depending on the form of marginal heat production used at the mill site. In the CHP process, reduction of the heat load lowers electricity production, and this reduction may have to be compensated for at the national level. Therefore, the energy conservation potential in industry has to be evaluated by taking into account the connections to the outside society, which means that a wider system boundary than a mill site has to be used. This study demonstrates by theoretical analysis and case mill studies the magnitude of the effects of system boundary definition when evaluating the contribution of an individual energy efficiency investment towards fulfilling the commitment to reduce CO 2 emissions at the national level.

For this investigation, a hypothetical small shopping mall ("Microgrid Oaks") was developed and analyzed for the cost effectiveness of installing CHP to provide the mGrid's energy needs. A mGrid consists of groups of customers pooling energy loads and installing a combination of generation resources that meets the particular mGrid's goals. This study assumes the mGrid is seeking to minimize energy costs. mGrids could operate independently of the macrogrid (the wider power network), but they are usually assumed to be connected, through power electronics, to the macrogrid.

40|$|The most {{important}} issues in the European energy sector today are how to increase competitiveness on the energy markets, reduce both CO 2 emissions and dependence on imported fuels. These issues are also important aspects of Swedish energy policy. In Sweden, the district heating (DH) sector has commonly been used to achieve Swedish energy policy goals. However, the ongoing integration and deregulation of the energy markets in Europe now means that the Swedish DH sector can also {{play an important role}} in achieving international targets. This thesis investigates the extent to which the Swedish DH sector can contribute to compliance with current energy policy targets, both international and Swedish. The study consisted of simulations of the Swedish DH sector response to various policy instruments in a model that takes the local features of virtually all Swedish DH systems into account. The findings show, for example, that there is great potential for combined heat and power (CHP) generation in the Swedish DH sector. By exporting this <b>CHP</b> <b>electricity</b> to other European countries with less effective and fossil dependent power generation plants, the CO 2 emissions from the European energy sector could be substantially reduced.

40|$|Based on {{statistics}} about fuel demand in industry sectors a method is {{developed for the}} estimation of additional {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) potential in the main industry sectors. Electricity generation costs of several CHP technologies are then compared to the purchase of electricity on electricity markets. It is found that additional heat potential for CHP is limited in the chemical industry; additional potential is found in the paper industry, food industry and in the manufacturing industry. Additional electricity potential for CHP can be found in all sectors as electricity to heat share is 0. 34 at the moment and can be increased with new installations to more than 0. 7. The share of renewable fuels used in CHP is highest in the wood and paper industry, additional potential can be found in several branches, but costs are high at the moment. Markets can pick up <b>CHP</b> <b>electricity</b> in the short term and installations are profitable when long operating hours can be reached. Looking in electricity markets with a higher share of renewable energy sources (RES), operation become more restricted making new operation strategies necessary. Times with electricity prices below short term generation costs of CHP installations increase in the future, so that operation will be less profitable. In short term CHP can bring additional CO 2 reduction, specific emissions are below new combined cycle units.

Renewable sources can supply electricity with low emissions, but their penetration rate is still insufficient to meet current demand, let alone the extra demand of EVs. A promising option is supply by Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants with high combined efficiencies, but an in-depth evaluation of the benefits of combining of EVs and CHP plants is still missing. Therefore, this study evaluates the performance of four different types of CHP plants to power electric vehicles, as compared to use of electricity from the grid. The performance of CHP plants is simulated using detailed datasets of the composition of a future power system, the demand for household electricity and heat, and technical specifications of CHP plants and electric vehicles. We find that the lowest abatement costs of 60 – 190 €/tCO 2 are achieved with grid electricity based on a low-carbon electricity mix compared to a business-as-usual electricity mix with marginal emissions of 450 – 500 gCO 2 /kW h. When electricity is supplied by CHP plants, emissions are − 1000 to 400 gCO 2 /kW h, and abatement costs are 165 – 940 €/tCO 2.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{it has been more}} common to use linear or mixed-integer {{programming}} methods for finding optimal solutions to the complicated operating options in modern Combined Heat and Power (<b>CHP)</b> networks. <b>Electricity</b> may be bought from the national grid or it may be produced in ordinary condenser or CHP plants owned by the utility. In the same manner, district heat can be produced by the use of waste heat from industries or from a CHP plant. Other options are burning garbage in an incineration plant, using heat pumps in a sewage water plant or just burning fuels in an ordinary boiler. Combining these options and including the possibility of using conservation measures in industry or in the housing stock will result in a very complex situation if one tries to find the optimal solution characterized by the the lowest Life-Cycle Cost (LCC). Load management equipment, such as hot-water accumulators, will aggravate the problem even further. By the use of modern computers, complicated problems can be solved within a reasonable period of time. The bases for the mathematical models are the thermal and electrical loads. Splitting these loads into finer and finer segments will yield a model that will depict reality more closely. Two methods have been used frequently, one where the high and low unit price hours in each month have been lumped together, resulting in 24 segments plus one segment showing the influence of the maximum electricity demand. The other method tries to model the loads by lumping the energy demand in six electricity-tariff segments, but also using about 15 elements for a more versatile picture of the district-heating load. This paper describes the two methods using monitored data for 1990 - 1991 from Kalmar in the south of Sweden. It also discusses which of the methods is preferable or whether a combination must be elaborated upon in order to model reality closely enough for practical use. ...|$|R

A comparison between using a regular control curve and using the dynamic model for controlling the supply temperature indicated that with the same risk of heat deficit, the dynamic control strategy could increase the electricity production with 390 MWh per year, most of it during the winter months.

In a combined heat and power plant (<b>CHP)</b> <b>electricity</b> and heat are cogenerated. The environmental and economic advantages with this kind of production are high. A problem in a CHP-plant is to allocate costs between electricity and heat since both products are generated in the same process.

In order to carry out this study, twelve Swedish energy companies were interviewed. The interviews were made from a qualitative perspective. A qualitative approach provides a deeper understanding of the cost allocation problem and offers a higher level of flexibility. Half of the companies that were interviewed stated that they allocated some of their costs to either electricity or to heat. All of these companies allocated fuel costs. In order to do this the companies based their allocation proportionally on the production output. Reasons given for allocation were to optimize production, increase control over costs, and obtain a general view of which product causes which cost.

40|$|This thesis explores how energy {{efficiency}} improvement implemented in industrial plants contributes towards achieving CO 2 emission reduction. The measurement of {{energy efficiency}} and CO 2 emissions are related issues. The implications of the following challenges in measuring energy efficiency have been evaluated based on constructive case studies: variables affecting energy efficiency, the allocation problem, system boundary definitions and energy valuation. In addition, the realisation of emission reduction potential is analysed. The thesis shows that, among other things, the utilisation of recycled materials is an important variable {{that has to be}} taken into account when the energy efficiencies of different plants are compared. In the case of CHP production, some cost allocation methods, such as the energy method, may overestimate the feasibility of heat conservation investment from the industrial mill perspective. Due to heat conservation, <b>CHP</b> <b>electricity</b> production may be reduced at the mill site, which increases the demand for external electricity. The purchase of external electricity has implications for energy consumption and CO 2 emissions at the national level. Therefore, the realised CO 2 reduction of heat conservation investment may seem totally different from the mill site and national perspectives, which demonstrates the importance of the system boundary definition when evaluating the contribution of an individual energy efficiency investment towards fulfilling the commitment to reduce CO 2 emissions. Also, increased operational flexibility and changing market conditions, such as energy and emission allowance prices, complicate the evaluation of the emission reduction potential and often reduce the exploitation of the full emission reduction potential.

Buildings constitute a {{great potential for}} energy savings, but saving energy in district-heated buildings influences {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) production, other electricity generation, and global CO 2 emissions.   This thesis investigates the system effects from Swedish district heating production caused by district heating demand changes due to energy conservation in buildings. The cost-optimising linear programming modelling tools MODEST and FMS, the latter developed {{in the context of this}} thesis, are used to describe present district heating production and to investigate the impact of heat-demand reductions in twelve Swedish district heating systems, four of them representing all Swedish district heating.   Energy savings in district-heated, multi-family residential buildings yield a lower, more seasonally levelled district heating demand. These demand changes mainly reduce use of fossil-fuel and biomass for heat production. CHP production is significantly reduced if it supplies intermediate or peak district heating load. The αsystem value (ratio between generated <b>CHP</b> <b>electricity</b> and produced district heating) increases by demand reductions if CHP mainly supplies base district heating load. CO 2 emissions due to district heat production depend on the approach used for CO 2 assessment of electricity, and are generally reduced with heat demand reductions, unless the share of CHP production is large and the reduced fuel use yields smaller emission reductions than the emission increase from power production that replaces reduced CHP generation.   In total, heat demand reductions reduce CO 2 emissions due to Swedish district heating, and the district heating systems even constitute a carbon sink at certain energy conservation levels. If saved biomass replaces fossil fuels elsewhere, a lower heat demand reduces CO 2 emissions for every studied district heating system...|$|E

Results are for a gasifier integrated to a large size <b>CHP</b> plant producing <b>electricity</b> and district heat. The power plant simulation program GateCycle is used for plant performance evaluation. The study investigates the technical and economic performance of the CHP plant and the consequences for global fossil CO 2 emissions.

The results show that integrating an oxygen-blown gasifier to the CHP plant can be an attractive option if policy instruments favouring production of transportation fuels from biomass are expected in the future. The assumed value for costs associated with emitting CO 2 is 250 SEK/tonne. A price premium of 200 SEK/MWh for electricity based upon renewable energy sources is also assumed. The resulting cost of electricity (COE) for a NGCC CHP plant co-fired with oxygen-blown gasified biofuel is 367 SEK/MWh compared to 354 SEK/MWh if the gasifier is air-blown.

Two gasification applications are included: co-production of SNG (synthetic natural gas) for use as transportation fuel and DH heat in a biorefinery, and BIGCC CHP (biomass integrated gasification combined cycle, combined heat and power). Using an optimisation model the level of policy support necessary to make biofuel production competitive to electricity generation, {{and the level of}} tradable green electricity certificates necessary to make gasification based electricity generation competitive to conventional steam cycle technology, are identified. The results show that in order for investment in SNG production to be competitive to investment in electricity production in the DH system, support policies promoting biofuels in the range of 16 - 22  EUR/MWh are needed.

Energy recovery from this waste in combined incineration plants for district heat and <b>electricity</b> (<b>CHP)</b> may serve as an additional measure for greenhouse gas reduction in local communities. Since buildings are responsible for approximately 40 % of energy consumption, it is important to reduce energy consumption. In Finland, due to the long heating season, the energy production method and heat source are extremely important for greenhouse gas reduction. This paper discusses energy recovery from waste in a case study of a new residential area in southern Finland. All the buildings fulfil current Finnish energy requirements and represent typical wooden frame construction with rendering façades. It is assumed that the households will be connected to the local district heat system, in which heat is produced partly in gas-driven heat plants and partly in a municipal waste incineration plant. We show that energy recovery from waste should not be underestimated, because it is a valuable means of greenhouse gas reduction, especially in local communities...|$|R
40|$|Heat loss in {{pipes and}} pump {{electrical}} energy consumption are unavoidable during {{the operation of}} a district heating (DH) system. In order to reduce total operating costs and improve energy efficiency appropriate operating strategy should be chosen. This study is aimed at optimising the supply water temperature and mass flow rate in a DH system, depending on the heating load variations. The minimisation of operating costs of DH system with different heat sources was conducted. Two different design cases of a DH pipe network based upon of a real project redevelopment in Wales, UK, were considered. First, the DH pipe network was designed based on a low pressure loss (100 Pa/m). It means that pipes with large diameters and small size pump were chosen. Second, the DH pipe network was re-designed using a larger pressure drop (1200 Pa/m). In this case smaller diameter pipes and larger size pump were selected. An optimisation model was developed using FICOTM Xpress optimisation tool. Hydraulic and thermal calculations were validated using commercial software PSS SINCAL. Three cases with different heat sources connected to the DH network were investigated. In the first case {{it was assumed that}} the fuel cost was negligible. In the second case, water boiler was used. In the third case combined heat and power (CHP) connected to the DH network was considered. The optimisation of annual supply water temperature and mass flow rate was achieved by minimising annual operating costs. Heat loss and pump energy consumption were calculated. Results show that optimum flow and supply temperature profile over the year are different when different types of heat sources and different designs of the DH pipe network are used. The difference is particularly substantial when a CHP connected to the DH network, is used. It is observed that it is an advantage to reduce system supply temperature and increase flow rate more compared to the other heat sources connected to the DH network. In order to increase <b>CHP</b> <b>electricity</b> revenue and reduce heat loss cost when a back pressure steam turbine CHP is used...|$|E
40|$|From {{the late}} 1970 's {{to the early}} 1990 's {{cogeneration}} or CHP saw enormous growth, especially in the process industries. By 1994, CHP provided 42 GW of electricity generation capacity -about 6 percent of the U. S. total. Three manufacturing industries (Pulp and paper - 59 Twh; Chemicals - 47 Twh; Petroleum refuting -IS Twh) accounted for 85 % of all cogenerated electricity in 1994. But since the mid- 1990 s, installation of new CHP has slowed dramatically. This slow down is due to uncertainties and policies associated with electric utility restructuring and impending environmental regulations. By 1997, a group comprising CHP manufacturers and nonprofit groups had formed to identify these CHP barriers and to work to remove them. At the same time several studies {{on the role of}} energy efficiency in greenhouse gas emissions reductions identified CHP {{as one of the most}} promising options. These studies showed a key window of opportunity-many new or updated highly-efficient and lower-cost CHP systems will become available just when the industrial "boiler baby boom" retires. These technology opportunities take advantage of advances in materials, power electronics, and computer-aided design techniques have increased equipment efficiency and reliability dramatically, while reducing costs and emissions of pollutants. This next generation of turbines, fuel cells, and reciprocating engines is the result of intensive, collaborative research, development, and demonstration by government and industry. These have allowed for new configurations that reduce size yet increase output. Turbines are now cost-effective for systems down to 50 KW, the size of a small office or restaurant. Even smaller equipment is on the horizon. However, without rapid action, this opportune nexus of market, regulatory, and technology opportunities could dissipate. In fiscal year 1999, we launched the U. S. Department of Energy CHP Challenge program. By 2002 when the Challenge is complete, it should have substantially increased the use of CHP systems in industry and buildings. We estimate that efforts such as CHP Challenge could result in more than 50 MW of additional <b>CHP</b> <b>electricity</b> generation being installed at greater than 60 percent fuel-use efficiency (nearly double the average grid efficiency) by 2010. This paper will report on the first results of CHP Challenge and discuss future activities-especially in the industrial sector...|$|E
40|$|Latvian {{energy system}} {{has one of}} the highest {{penetration}} rate of district heating, and one of the lowest share of domestic electricity production among countries of EU. Therefore, use of CHP in district heating to decrease dependence on imported electricity and fuel as well as to minimise the environmental impact of heat and power supply is feasible solution that has to be promoted. The main target of the work was to continue investigation of potential heat loads of district heating available for CHP plants, selection of appropriate CHP technologies corresponding to the size of the district heating systems and available fuel, and creation of model where electricity prices from the studied CHP plants could be determined. Studies of CHP potential, based on actual fuel consumption in nearly all Latvian district heating systems with Winter maximum heat load exceeding 1 MW was done and the results are presented in this work. These results allowed to evaluate an amount of heat and electricity which could be potentially produced in Latvia by CHP plants, and corresponding saving of primary energy resources compared to separate heat and power production. Furthermore, the calculated savings of primary energy resources made it possible to estimate potential reduction of environmental impact when CHP production is compared with separate heat and power production. This reduction of environmental impact is expressed in tons of CO 2, NOx and SOx eliminated by CHP, and corresponding monetary value of this reduction is found by looking at CO 2 prices in emission trade market and estimates of externalities of these pollutants. With help of the model of economic calculations, investment needed to exploit the studied CHP potential is calculated, and prices of produced electricity by various CHP technologies are calculated. The calculation includes also fuel price forecast in order to compare prices of <b>CHP</b> <b>electricity</b> with forecast of general electricity price level during time period of up to 2020. The fuels that are considered to be used by analysed CHP systems are natural gas, wood and coal. Thus, the economic calculation model helps to find the optimum scenario for utilisation of CHP potential in Latvia during the considered time period with target condition that the weighted average electricity price from CHP plants is kept at minimum...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper relates to a small scale district heating network heated by a gas fired CHP. In most common situations, such a CHP is heat driven operated, meaning that the CHP will switch on whenever heat is needed, while not taking into account the demand of electricity at that time. In this paper however, an active control strategy is developed, aiming to maximize the profit of the <b>CHP,</b> selling its <b>electricity</b> to the spot market. The CHP will therefore switch on at moments of high electricity prices. Nevertheless, since there never is a perfect match between the demand of heat and the demand of electricity, a thermal energy storage is included in the network to overcome the difference between supply and demand of heat in the network. In this study, three different storage concepts are compared: (1) a central buffer tank next to the CHP; (2) small storage vessels distributed over the different connected buildings; and (3) the use of the thermal mass if the buildings as storage capacity. Besides the development of the control algorithms based on model predictive control, a simulation model of the network is described to evaluate the performance of the different storage concept during a representative winter week. The results show that the presented control algorithm can significantly influence the heat demand profile of the connected buildings. As a results, active control of the CHP can drastically increase the profit of the CHP. The concept with the distributed buffers gives the best results, however the profit for the thermal mass concept is only marginally smaller. Since in this latter case no significant investment costs are needed, the conclusion for this case study is that the use of thermal mass of buildings for demand side management in district heating systems is very promising...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{theoretical}} technical study {{was carried out}} using Brazilian available biomass materials (rice husk, coffee husk and elephant grass) compared to natural gas applied to an electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking process. Rice and coffee husk are biomass residues from the agriculture while elephant grass (Pennisetum Purpureum Schum) is an abundant, fast growing plant, which is used for cattle breeding. The ultimate analysis of the biomass materials {{was carried out in}} the research department of a Brazilian Steelmaking Industry. The results of the ultimate analysis were used to determine the lower calorific value and the mass flow rate of the biomass materials used in the cogeneration system. The actual steelmaking process uses natural gas to both improve the “cold spots” inside the furnace and contribute to minimize the use of electrical energy in the heating process. The feasibility study considers a combined heat and power plant (<b>CHP)</b> to generate <b>electricity</b> and heat to the electric arc furnace (EAF) process. This study used the First Law of Thermodynamics to determine the operational parameters of the cogeneration plant considering three cases of different operational parameters in the Rankine cycle. The technical results show that the natural gas consumption and exhaust gas generation were the lowest among the fuels in the three cases analyzed. Regarding the exhaust gases generation, some aspects should be highlighted: the combustion of biomass is considered carbon neutral; the exhaust gases generated may be used to scrap preheat; also, biomass is a renewable fuel in contrast with natural gas, which is a fossil fuel. Thus, an economic analysis, considering only the operational cost of the plant, was conducted exhibiting that elephant grass had the lowest operational cost, accounting for a reduction of about 9 % in the second case and 15 % in the third case compared to natural gas. Although the biomasses have lower LCV than natural gas, they showed a great promise of their use in the EAF process indicating their feasibility as an excellent alternative for the process of producing iron...|$|R
40|$|This thesis work {{looks at}} the present {{situation}} of power generation and utilization in Africa as compared {{to other parts of}} the world. The analysis then focuses on biomass resources in Nigeria, with a village in southern Nigeria taken as a case study. The importance of biomass-based electrical power generation in alleviating the energy situation in Nigeria is examined and discussed. The biomass is used as fuel in a combined heat and power (<b>CHP)</b> plant for <b>electricity</b> and heat generation. Remaining Biomass is used in the farmland for food production. Two cases were considered: one in which only a portion of the biomass produced in the mill is used for electricity generation and the other in which all biomass produced in the mill is used for electricity generation. These two cases were compared with a reference case representing the current energy utilization in the village and mill. In the first case, using the total amount of electricity required by both the village and the mill as basis, the results suggest that steam flow rate required to produce that amount of electricity is 0. 4 kg/s using about 19 % of total biomass available. This is less than the 0. 6 kg/s steam required by the mill. Results of the second case, suggest that using the total amount of biomass as basis, the boiler produces steam at a rate of 2 kg/s (more than the mill steam demand), and about 1 MW of electricity generated – 81 % in excess of the village and the mills demands. The excess electricity could be supplied to the grid. Sale of the excess electricity will generate additional revenue for the mill thereby reducing the payback period. Results of the calculation suggest that the second case is a more profitable option than the first. It was recommended that further study be undertaken using field data. That important part of such a study is a more deep engineering study as well as investigation and updating of prices, investment cost and local conditions. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
