L-Mode experiments scanned parameters influencing the JET scrape-off-layer (SOL) and/or intrinsic impurity level. Scaling relations are derived to describe methane injected into L-Mode plasmas from the JET horizontal mid-plane. L-Mode screening was 3 – 20 times better for plasmas {{connected to the}} divertor than for similar limited plasmas. The screening was worse for methane injection from the mid-plane and best for injection from the divertor. The screening was 1. 5 – 2 times worse for H-Mode than L-Mode. Both ELM-averaged and inter-ELM H-Mode screening was documented. The screening results were used to understand the intrinsic impurity levels. Zeff reduced at higher densities partly due to better <b>carbon</b> <b>screening</b> at the higher density, and partly due to decreased carbon influxes. Diverted L-Mode intrinsic carbon levels arose from both main chamber and divertor sources, while H-mode carbon primarily originated from the divertor. DIVIMP and EDGE 2 D were used to model the observed screening. The modelling indicated that carbon removal to the divertor required lower temperatures for Coulomb collisions to couple the impurity ions to the SOL deuterium flows. The carbon removal occurred primarily in the outer SOL regions...|$|R

40|$|Plasma {{impurity}} content {{depends upon}} the impurity sources, fueling efficiency, and confinement. In JET [Joint European Torus], carbon is the primary impurity, and its fueling efficiency has been studied using methane gas injection and modeled with the SOL [scrape-off layer] codes: DIVIMP and EDGE 2 D. In this paper, EDGE 2 D modeling of similar AUG [ASDEX-Upgrade] experiments and projections to ITER are described. The parameters have been identified which govern the size scaling of <b>carbon</b> <b>screening.</b> Size scaling is complex. For carbon injected from the main chamber, the important factors include: the SOL temperature, {{the magnitude of the}} thermal force at the divertor entrance, and the parallel distance to the divertor. For carbon injected at the strike points, the intersection of the carbon ionization region with the region of strong thermal force determines the carbon fueling efficiency ITER projects to have much better <b>carbon</b> <b>screening</b> than JET. The ITER SOL is hotter so that main chamber carbon is ionized further from the separatrix making the calculated carbon fueling efficiency lower. Also, the carbon originating near the strike point has less chance of escaping the divertor by factors of about 100. The carbon sputtering is projected to be larger by similar factors, making the projected ITER core contamination similar to JET. However, that result is based upon the assumption that the wall materials have similar composition and behavior as observed on JET. A general result is that the core contamination at fixed total sputtering rate and core impurity confinement increases when the fraction of carbon ionized in the main chamber SOL increases, and decreases for larger machine size and higher density operation...|$|R

Efficiencies of a microchannel plate detector for medium energy helium and carbon ions were determined using a recently developed time of flight technique for near surface analysis by medium energy ion scattering. This technique utilizes a pulsed beam of singly charged helium- 4 or carbon- 1 2 ions with energies in the 60 - 140 keV range to provide enhanced energy resolution (1. 2 % to 2. 3 %) when compared to conventional Rutherford backscattering techniques using solid state detectors (around 6. 5 % for helium).

40|$|ABSTRACT Climate {{change has}} been {{influenced}} more by human activities now than previously. These influences are largely attributed to industries, whose activities can potentially produce enormous amounts {{of carbon dioxide and}} other greenhouse gases, and exacerbate the speed of climate change. This thesis examines how the financial markets evaluate corporationsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 greenhouse gas emission performance. We consider various emission criteria, and distinguish between the better and worse performers in different emission policy regimes, including the US, the UK {{and the rest of the}} EU. The investigations have been conducted at three stages, presented in chapter 3, 4 and 5. Firstly, in chapter 3 we examine the carbon effects at the portfolio-level, where total return indices are our main concern. By adopting the long-short strategy, we report that investors in the UK and EU markets, can make an arbitrage profit at the lower cut-off levels, when applying various <b>carbon</b> <b>screening</b> policies and forming equally-weighted portfolios. However, no such profit opportunities can be achieved in the US market. We further consider the reason for such arbitrage opportunities, which is the link between corporate governance/management efficiency and different levels of carbon constraint. Secondly, in chapter 4, the carbon effects are investigated at firm-level, where firmsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 financial market values act as the dependent variable. Our regression models are based on the Ohlson framework, which considers firmsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 financial market value in relation to its accounting performance, and the â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 other informationâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9, which in our case is the carbon emission performance. We find a significant relationship between the US firmsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 values and their carbon emission performances; however, this relationship has been weakened for UK companies, and in fact becomes even unreliable for EU companies. Further, in order to explore the reason for this relationship, we have focused on energy efficiency and firmsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 reputation that are associated with carbon reduction activities. The scale effects have also been discussed in this chapter, as the various deflators are adopted. Finally, in chapter 5, again at firm-level, cash flow expectation and cost of capital have been considered to possibly be the source that drives firmsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 value. Cash flow expectation is measured at the short-, medium- and long- term, by profitability, earnings growth, and residual income growth rate, respectively. Two portfolios for each target parameters are constructed according to different <b>carbon</b> <b>screening</b> criteria at different cut-off levels, the differences between each pair of portfolios are then calculated and tested for significance. A sub-sample regression, which is based on the observations available from analystsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 earnings forecast, has been conducted for each of the three regimes. After matching the portfolio and regression results, we report that the implied cost of equity is only reduced for the less carbon emission firms, in regimes where more stringent carbon constraints are applied; whereas in regimes where less stringent carbon constraints exist, the less carbon emission firms have not gained any advantage through their implied cost of equity. Also, cash flow expectations indicate diverse outcomes for different time horizon and regimes. Furthermore, various market participants, such as governments, investors, distributors and clients etc, who could possibly influence firmsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 carbon behaviour, have also been considered in association with their roles in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

D-Galacturonic acid as well as other sugar acids such as D-gluconic and D-glucuronic acids are associated with grape infection by B. Cinerea. They are characteristic of the disease and therefore their presence has been used as an indicator of the degree of infection. None of these sugar acids affects taste or odor of wine. However, D-galacturonic acid may be involved in the browning of white wines, a process of continuous oxidation which can cause loss of aromatic freshness and, in the final stages, the appearance of precipitates of condensed phenolic material in the bottled wine. The determination of D-galacturonic acid is therefore of particular interest in wine production. Food control analyses require robust, sensitive, and selective detection methods. The most commonly used methods such as chromatography and mass spectrometry require expensive instrumentations and skilled technicians.

40|$|XIX Meeting of the Portuguese Electrochemical Society - XVI Iberic Meeting of ElectrochemistryProstate Cancer (PCa) is {{the most}} common form of cancer in men in Europe with a 61. 4 % {{incidence}} among all cancer cases and a 12. 1 % mortality [1] and, therefore, its early detection is fundamental for increasing the survival rate. Currently, diagnosis and management of patients with PCa is only based on the determination of the biomarker Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA). However, the method used for PCa detection has poor sensitivity and specificity, leading to false negative and false positive test results and many patients are sent to unnecessary biopsy procedures [2]. Therefore, there is a need to seek for new biomarkers and more effective screening. In this work, a biosensor device was developed for the quantification of sarcosine via electrochemical detection of H 2 O 2 (at 0. 6 V) generated from the catalyzed oxidation of sarcosine. The detection was carried out after the modification of <b>carbon</b> <b>screen</b> printed electrodes (SPEs) by immobilization of sarcosine oxidase (SOX) on the electrode surface. The strategies used herein included the activation of the carbon films by an electrochemical step and the formation of an NHS/EDAC layer to bond the enzyme to the electrode, the use of metallic or semiconductor nanoparticles layer previously or during the enzyme immobilization. In order to improve the sensor stability and selectivity a polymeric layer with extra enzyme content was further added. The proposed methodology for the detection of sarcosine allowed obtaining a limit of detection (LOD) of 1. 6 x 10 - 5 mM, using a linear concentration range between 1 x 10 - 5 and 1 x 10 - 4 mM. The biosensor was successfully applied to the analysis of sarcosine in urine samples...|$|E

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) techniques are currently used to quantify samples containing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in forensic analyses. This technology can provide valuable information to an analyst regarding the amount of DNA present but lacks the ability to determine the quality of the sample. Electrochemistry-based biosensors that utilize screen-printed electrodes may provide a method to determine the number of DNA molecules and the length of those molecules in a single assay. This work aimed to create a biosensor by electrostatically loading TPOX oligonucleotides onto a carbon screen-printed electrode for the purpose of quantifying genomic DNA. Electrochemical signal was obtained via the indicating molecule bis-benzimide H 33258, which preferentially interacts with double-stranded DNA and would indicate a hybridization event. Cyclic voltammetry was chosen to measure the current signal; peaks obtained using this technique can be analyzed with the Randles-Sevčik equation, which relates current signal with concentration of the target species. A large amount of signal variation and background charging current was observed when H 33258 was used as the redox probe. This led to a study of the surface characteristics of the carbon electrodes themselves (i. e. effective surface area) by utilizing the reversible and well-characterized redox couple hexaammine ruthenium. The effect of electrode activation at high anodic potentials was also studied. Though highly recommended in the literature, activation of the carbon surface caused effective surface area and charging current to increase. While a larger electro-active surface is often desirable, the high background current generated when activation is used within the protocol can mask the signal of interest. Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and inability to reuse the carbon electrode, it was concluded that <b>carbon</b> <b>screen</b> printed electrodes are not optimal forensic DNA biosensors. 2031 - 01 - 0...|$|E

40|$|A gene {{involved}} in N-acyl homoserine lactone (N-AHSL) degradation was identified by screening a genomic library of Rhodococcus erythropolis strain W 2. This gene, named qsdA (for quorum-sensing signal degradation), encodes an N-AHSL lactonase {{unrelated to the}} two previously characterized N-AHSL-degrading enzymes, i. e., the lactonase AiiA and the amidohydrolase AiiD. QsdA is related to phosphotriesterases and constitutes the reference of a novel class of N-AHSL degradation enzymes. It confers the ability to inactivate N-AHSLs with an acyl chain ranging from C 6 to C 14, with or without substitution at <b>carbon</b> 3. <b>Screening</b> {{of a collection of}} 15 Rhodococcus strains and strains closely related to this genus clearly highlighted the relationship between the ability to degrade N-AHSLs and the presence of the qsdA gene in Rhodococcus. Bacteria harboring the qsdA gene interfere very efficiently with quorum-sensing-regulated functions, demonstrating that qsdA is a valuable tool for developing quorum-quenching procedures...|$|R

Cyclic voltammetry at a <b>carbon</b> based <b>screen</b> printed electrode (SPE) permitted to detect the irreversible oxidation of SOR with formation of a new compound reversibly oxidized at a lower potential. Quantitative assays were realized using a chitosan/carboxylic acid functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon electrode in 0. 1 M phosphate buffer pH 7. 0 in the presence of 50 % methanol. The AdSDPV method provided two linear responses within the concentration ranges 1 × 10 - 8 - 8 × 10 - 8 M and 1 × 10 - 7 - 8 × 10 - 7 M in serum with LOQ and LOD of 3. 2 × 10 - 9 and 9. 6 × 10 - 10 of lower linear range, respectively.
