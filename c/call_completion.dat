25|$|Throughout {{its service}} time, the Panel system was {{upgraded}} as new features became available or necessary. Starting in the mid-1920s, such upgrades improved the initial design. Major attention was initially focused on improving the sender. Early two- and three-digit type senders stored dialed digits on rotary selector switches. The senders employed translators {{to convert the}} dialed digits into the appropriate brush and group selections needed to complete the call. As better technology became available, Panel senders were upgraded to the all-relay type. These were more reliable, and in addition, replaced the translator equipment with decoders, which also operated entirely with relays, rather than with motor-driven apparatus, which yielded faster <b>call</b> <b>completion.</b>|$|E
25|$|SPIT (SPam over Internet Telephony) is VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) spam, usually using SIP (Session Initiation Protocol). This {{is nearly}} {{identical}} to telemarketing calls over traditional phone lines. When the user chooses to receive the spam call, a pre-recorded spam message or advertisement is usually played back. This is generally easier for the spammer as VoIP services are cheap and easy to anonymize over the Internet, {{and there are many}} options for sending mass amounts of calls from a single location. Accounts or IP addresses being used for VoIP spam can usually be identified by a large number of outgoing calls, low <b>call</b> <b>completion</b> and short call length.|$|E
2500|$|A {{dispatch}} {{function of}} sorts {{has always been}} a feature of both emergency medical service and its predecessor, ambulance service. The information processing, if only to identify the problem and the location of the patient, {{has always been a}} logical {{part of the process of}} <b>call</b> <b>completion.</b> Prior to the professionalization of emergency medical services, this step in the process was often informal; the caller would simply call the local ambulance service, the telephone call would be answered (in many cases by the ambulance attendant who would be responding to the call), the location and problem information would be gathered, and an ambulance assigned to complete the detail. [...] The ambulance would then complete the call, return to the station, and wait for the next telephone call. [...] Although earlier experiments with the use of radio communication in ambulances did occur, it was not until the 1950s that the use of radio dispatch became widespread in the United States and Canada. Indeed, during the 1950s the presence of radio dispatch was often treated as a marketing inducement, and was prominently displayed on the sides of ambulances, along with other technological advances, such as carrying oxygen. [...] Dispatch methodology was often determined by the business arrangements of the ambulance company. [...] If the ambulance were under contract to the town, it might be dispatched as an 'add-on' to the fire department or police department resources. In some cases, it might be under contract to the local hospital, and dispatched from there. [...] In many cases, small independent ambulance companies were simply dispatched by a family member or employee, employed part-time in many cases. [...] Ambulance dispatchers required little in the way of qualifications, apart from good telephone manners and a knowledge of the local geography.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} decision when implementing languages with polymorphic types, such as Standard ML or Haskell, {{is whether to}} represent data in boxed or unboxed form and when to transform them from one representation to the other. Using a language with explicit representation types and boxing/unboxing operations we axiomatize equationally the set of all explicitly boxed versions, <b>called</b> <b>completions,</b> of a given source program. In a two-stage process we give some of the equations a rewriting interpretation that captures eliminating boxing/unboxing operations without relying on a specific implementation or even the semantics of the underlying language.

50|$|Although {{the system}} is said to ensure a high {{probability}} of <b>call</b> <b>completion,</b> it is not without serious limitations. The WPS will not preempt calls in progress, so the user {{will have to wait}} for bandwidth to open. It is also not yet supported by all carriers. In order for a call to work, telephone infrastructure must be powered and functioning. Finally, a call that receives priority using WPS does not automatically get priority on landline networks. Therefore, congestion on the Public Switched Telephone Network may prevent the call from completion unless the user makes additional steps to access the GETS service for landline calls as well. Because of these and other limitations, the WPS explicitly does not guarantee <b>call</b> <b>completion.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper evaluates call {{admission}} control algorithms for a cellular or microcellular system. Algorithms are evaluated {{based on two}} Quality of Service (QoS) metrics: the new call blocking probability, which is {{the probability that a}} new call is denied access to the system, and the forced-termination probability, which is the probability that a call that has been admitted will be terminated prior to the <b>call's</b> <b>completion.</b> Three novel algorithms are presented: the Weighted Sum Scheme, the Probability Index Scheme, and the Hybrid Control Scheme. The weighted sum scheme uses the weighted sum of the number of calls underway in various cells when making the admission decision. The probability index scheme computes a probability index, which reflects the forced-termination probability of a new call arrival, and admits those calls with low probability indexes. The hybrid control scheme combines these two approaches. These novel algorithms are compared with three known algorithms: the Reservat [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{transaction}} ordering {{problem of}} the original PCI 2. 1 standard bus specification violates the desired correctness property of maintaining the so called `Producer/Consumer' relationship between writers and readers of data. This violation stems mainly from the so <b>called</b> <b>completion</b> stealing problem, first identified and solved by Corella et al [4], and supported by a formal paper and pencil argument. In this paper, we develop a flexible graph theory library in PVS for modeling computer bus structures, formalize the PCI 2. 1 protocol containing the solution of [4] in it, and mechanically prove the absence of completion stealing. Next, we define the Producer/Consumer property in PVS and sketch its mechanical proof. Noting the complexity of this proof effort (unfinished as yet), we explore a combination of theorem proving and model-checking in which the model used for model-checking is made tractable by exploiting the formal theorems established during theoremproving {{as well as several}} i [...] ...|$|R
