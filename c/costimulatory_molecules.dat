25|$|Less commonly, SAgs {{attach to}} the {{polymorphic}} MHC class II β-chain in an interaction mediated by a zinc ion coordination complex between three SAg residues and a highly conserved region of the HLA-DR β chain. The use of a zinc ion in binding leads to a higher affinity interaction. Several staphylococcal SAgs are capable of cross-linking MHC molecules by binding to both the α and β chains. This mechanism stimulates cytokine expression and release in antigen presenting cells as well as inducing the production of <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecules</b> that allow the cell to bind to and activate T cells more effectively.|$|E

FIPs stimulate different cells and cellular components that enable immune response. Some of the molecules and cells that FIPs influence include T and B lymphocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages, and regulation of human monocyte DCs. Improved function of these cells will promote cytokine expression such as IL2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma which will support lymphocyte proliferation, immune cell initiation, and tumor inhibiting factors.

40|$|The murine B 7 (mB 7) {{protein is}} a potent <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecule</b> for the T-cell {{receptor}} (TCR) -mediated activation of murine CD 4 + T cells. We have previously shown that stable mB 7 -transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells but not vector-transfected controls synergize with either anti-CD 3 monoclonal antibody-induced or concanavalin A-induced T-cell activation, resulting ultimately in lymphokine production and proliferation. We now have generated a hamster anti-mB 7 monoclonal antibody. This reagent recognizes a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 50 - 60 kDa. The mB 7 antigen is expressed on activated B cells and on peritoneal exudate cells (PECs). Antibody blocking experiments demonstrate that mB 7 is the major <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecule</b> expressed by PECs for the activation of murine CD 4 + T cells. This suggests an important role for mB 7 during immune-cell interactions. We have also surveyed a panel of murine cell lines capable of providing costimulatory activity. Our results indicate that mB 7 is the major <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecule</b> on some but not all cell lines and {{that there may be}} additional molecules besides mB 7 that can costimulate the activation of murine CD 4 + T cells...|$|R

Here, we show that soluble CD 86 is detected in human serum. Soluble CD 86 is produced by resting monocytes and results from an alternatively spliced transcript (CD 86 ΔTM) characterized by deletion of the transmembrane domain. Recombinant CD 86 ΔTM binds to CD 28 and CTLA- 4 and induces the activation of T cells after stimulation with anti-CD 3 mAb. CD 86 ΔTM also induces IFNγ production by virus-specific CD 8 + memory human T cells stimulated with the Flu M 1 peptide. The concentrations of soluble CD 86 found in human serum are sufficient to induce biological activity.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between CD 40 ligand and CD 40 {{is critical for}} activation of T and B cells in vivo. We have recently demonstrated that this interaction rapidly induces a novel costimulatory activity distinct from B 7 and independent of CD 28. To study the molecular basis of the costimulatory activity, we have produced a novel monoclonal antibody, TM- 1, that binds an 85 -kilodalton <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecule</b> rapidly induced by CD 40 L. Expression cloning reveals that TM- 1 binds CD 44 H. CD 44 H expressed on Chinese hamster ovary cells has potent costimulatory activity for clonal expansion of T cells isolated from both wild-type mice and these with a targeted mutation of CD 28. Thus, CD 44 H costimulates T cell proliferation by a CD 28 -independent mechanism. These results revealed that CD 44 H is a <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecule</b> rapidly induced by CD 40 L...|$|R

Studies have shown HPV-mediated suppression of activation of Langerhans cells (LC) is a key mechanism through which HPV 16 evades initial immune surveillance. However, {{it has not been}} established whether high- and low-risk mucosal and cutaneous HPV genotypes share a common mechanism of immune suppression. Here, we demonstrate that LC exposed to capsids of HPV types 18, 31, 45, 11, (alpha-papillomaviruses) and HPV 5 (beta-papillomavirus) similarly suppress LC activation, including lack of <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecule</b> expression, lack of cytokine and chemokine secretion, lack of migration, and deregulated cellular signaling. In contrast, HPV 1 (mu-papillomavirus) induced <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecule</b> and cytokine upregulation, but LC migration and cellular signaling was suppressed. These results suggest that alpha and beta HPV genotypes, and partially a mu genotype, share a conserved mechanism of immune escape that enables these viruses to remain undetected in the absence of other inflammatory events...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Allergic asthma is {{associated}} with TH 2 -like cell responses and increased IgE production. Recent studies in mice {{have suggested that the}} <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecule</b> B 7. 2 (CD 86) may influence the development of TH 2 cells. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the potential role of B 7. 2 in patients with asthma. METHODS: We performed an analysis of B cells from patients with allergic asthma and healthy control subjects for expression of B 7. 1 and B 7. 2 on B cells using five-parameter flow cytometry. RESULTS: We report that atopic patients with asthma who are exposed to allergens have significantly (p < 0. 005) higher levels of B 7. 2 expression on B cells than atopic asthmatic subjects not exposed to allergen in vivo or nonatopic control subjects. In contrast, there were no differences in B 7. 1 (CD 80) expression among the three study subject groups. When peripheral blood mononuclear cells from asthmatic patients or normal control subjects were stimulated with IL- 4 or IL- 13, the expression of B 7. 2, but not B 7. 1, was significantly increased (p < 0. 005) on B cells. Interferon-gamma or IL- 12 did not affect the expression of either molecule. The functional significance of B 7. 2 induction by IL- 4 in allergic disease was suggested by the increased expression of this molecule on CD 23 +, but not CD 23 -, B cells. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the same B cell involved in allergen presentation also expresses the <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecule</b> B 7. 2 and support the hypothesis that this molecule is an important <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecule</b> in allergic responses, the expression of which can be modulated by TH 2 -like cytokines...|$|R

Our results indicated that message levels of TMEV, tumor necrosis factor alpha, beta interferon, and interleukin- 6 were consistently higher in microglia from virus-infected SJL mice than in those from B 6 mice. However, the levels of <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecule</b> expression, as well as the ability to stimulate allogeneic T cells, were significantly lower in TMEV-infected SJL mice than in B 6 mice. In addition, microglia from uninfected naïve mice displayed differential viral replication, T-cell stimulation, and cytokine production, similar to those of microglia from infected mice. These results strongly suggest that different levels of intrinsic susceptibility to TMEV infection, cytokine production, and T-cell activation ability by microglia contribute to the levels of viral persistence and antiviral T-cell responses in the CNS, which are critical for the differential susceptibility to TMEV-induced demyelinating disease between SJL and B 6 mice...|$|R
