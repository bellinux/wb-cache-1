40|$|Background: In 2003, the Japanese {{government}} {{halted the}} national mass screening program for neuroblastoma (NB), {{which had been}} running since the mid- 1980 s. It is not known whether the NB mortality rate subsequently increased or decreased. Methods: Utilizing vital statistics data from 1980 through 2006, we analyzed the secular trends in NB mortality by using cancer of the adrenal gland as a surrogate. We examined the validity of this substitution {{by comparing the results}} with data from death certificates. Using a joinpoint regression model, we examined the trends in age-specific mortality rates by calendar year and <b>cumulative</b> <b>mortality</b> rates by birth year. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>mortality</b> rate was analyzed for age under 1 or 2 years for infants born after the cessation of the mass screening program. Results: The number of deaths from cancer of the adrenal gland was closely correlated with the number of deaths from NB. Significant decreases in the mortality rate were observed from 1980 through 2006 by calendar year for those aged under 1 year, 1 to 4 years, and 5 to 9 years. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>mortality</b> rates by birth year also significantly decreased from the 1980 birth cohort.

Meta-analysis compared 30 -day mortality {{between right and}} left pneumonectomy with a fixed-effects model. Comparison between 30 -day and 90 -day mortalities was also performed. ResultsThe search strategy yielded 27 studies. Overall, 30 -day and 90 -day perioperative mortalities were 7 % and 12 %, respectively. Among 15 studies providing side-specific 30 -day <b>mortality,</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>mortalities</b> were 11 % and 5 % for right and left pneumonectomies, respectively. In the meta-analysis that included 10 studies, 30 -day mortality for right pneumonectomy remained greater than for left pneumonectomy (odds ratio, 1. 97; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 11 – 3. 49; P = . 02). Among 6 studies providing side-specific 90 -day <b>mortality,</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>mortalities</b> were 20 % and 9 % for right and left pneumonectomies, respectively.

Four different vulture avoidance rates were considered in the CRM. <b>Cumulative</b> collision <b>mortality</b> {{was expected to be}} eight to ten times greater in the future (proposed and operating wind farms) than currently (operating wind farms), equivalent to 44 % of the current population (103 individuals) if all proposals are authorized (2744 MW).

On the basis of a sensitivity map we derive a spatially explicit solution that could meet the national target of wind harnessing with a minimum conservation cost of less than 1 % population loss providing that the population mortality (5. 2 %) caused by the operating wind farms in the core area would be totally mitigated.

The <b>cumulative</b> <b>mortalities</b> inoculated with 300 infective juveniles (IJs) per larva of S. abbasi against second to fourth instar larvae of Ae. aegypti were 21. 1, 30. 0, and 97. 8 %, respectively, whereas those inoculated with S. carpocapsae were 45. 6, 94. 4, and 97. 8 %, respectively. The LT 50 values of older instar larvae inoculated with both nematodes were shorter than those of younger instars. The LD 50 values of fourth instar larvae inoculated with S. abbasi and S. carpocapsae were 122. 6 and 44. 5 IJs/larva at 48 h after inoculation. Encapsulated nematodes were calculated from dead third or fourth instar larvae of Ae. aepypti inoculated with 200 IJs/larva of S. abbasi or S. carpocapsae. Numbers of encapsulated S. abbasi in third and fourth instar larvae were 1 - 4, and 0 - 10, respectively, whereas those of S. carpocapsae in third and furth instar larvae were 0 - 9, and 0 - 8, respectively.

However, the mortalities resulted from inoculations with those nematodes kept in water for 30 days were significantly lower than those for 10 and 20 days. In addition, the LT 50 value of fourth instar larvae inoculated with S. carpocapsae kept for 20 days was longer than that for 10 days. Therefore, our experimental data provide information for further studies on potential application of the entomopathogenic nematodes as biological control agents against mosquitoes. 本論文利用兩種蟲生線蟲Steinernema abbasi 及 S. carpocapsae對埃及斑蚊(Aedes aegypti) 幼蟲進行致病力之測定，發現埃及斑蚊第一齡幼蟲及蛹期均對兩種蟲生線蟲不具感受性。但S. abbasi 對第二、三及四齡幼蟲以侵染期幼蟲(infective juveniles, IJs) 劑量 300 IJs接種後 72 h累積死亡率分別為 21. 1 、 30. 0 及 97. 8 %；而以S. carpocapsae接種則死亡率分別為 45. 6 、 94. 4 及 97. 8 %。此外，隨著埃及斑蚊幼蟲齡期越大，兩種蟲生線蟲對幼蟲所造成之LT 50 則隨之縮短。此兩種線蟲對本斑蚊第四齡幼蟲於接種後 48 h 之LD 50 分別為 122. 6 及 44. 5 IJs/larva。以 200 IJs之S. abbasi 及S. carpocapsae接種埃及斑蚊第三齡及四齡幼蟲，S. abbasi於三齡幼蟲體內形成之囊體數目介於 1 - 4 個間，四齡幼蟲則介於 0 - 10 個；而S. carpocapsae於三齡幼蟲則介於 0 - 9 個，而四齡則介於 0 - 8 個之間。整體而言，斑蚊幼蟲體內含 1 個囊體的蟲數較多。兩種蟲生線蟲置於 20 、 25 及 30 °C環境下，對埃及斑蚊第四齡幼蟲之死亡率以 25 °C較高，分別為 93. 3 及 95. 6 %，而於 20 °C下死亡率最低分別為 20. 0 及 76. 7 %。而隨著溫度升高，S. carpocapsae對埃及斑蚊四齡幼蟲所需之LT 50 則隨之縮短。兩種蟲生線蟲對埃及斑蚊第四齡幼蟲於四種水體深度下所造成之死亡率彼此間無顯著差異。兩種蟲生線蟲於相同水深但不同表面積之水域處理，在直徑較大之水盤下接種第四齡幼蟲所造成之死亡率較低，隨著水盤直徑越大，S. carpocapsae對第四齡幼蟲所需之LT 50 則隨之增長。兩種線蟲經滯水 10 、 20 及 30 日對埃及斑蚊第四齡幼蟲所造成之死亡率，以 10 及 20 日處理分別為 33. 3 - 48. 9 和 80. 0 - 85. 6 %，且無顯著差異，而至第 30 日斑蚊之幼蟲死亡率顯著降低，滯水 20 日之S. carpocapsae對此斑蚊第四齡幼蟲所需之LT 50 較滯水 10 日者長。上述試驗提供蟲生線蟲對埃及斑蚊幼蟲之致病力之初步探討資料，此供進一步生物防治之參考。中文摘要……………………………………………………I 英文摘要……………………………………………………III 前言………………………………………………………… 1 文獻摘述…………………………………………………… 3 材料與方法………………………………………………… 14 結果………………………………………………………… 19 討論………………………………………………………… 26 結論………………………………………………………… 34 參考文獻…………………………………………………… 36 圖表………………………………………………………… 4...|$|R
40|$|Between 1987 and 1989 the Cancer Research Campaign funded {{a health}} {{education}} programme for the early detection of cutaneous malignant melanoma {{in the general population}} in 6 health districts of England and 1 health board in Scotland (population of 3 million). The intervention was evaluated by studying its effects on annual and <b>cumulative</b> <b>mortality</b> rates for melanoma. Population-based data on mortality from melanoma were collected in the intervention areas, the health regions covering those areas, and 5 other health regions of England from 1981 to 1996. Deaths from melanoma in cases diagnosed after the start of the intervention were used to study <b>cumulative</b> <b>mortality</b> rates. The annual mortality rates for melanoma, 1981 to 1996, showed no significant difference in their trends between the intervention areas, and other areas of England and Wales. After adjustment for pre-intervention rates, there was also no significant reduction in <b>cumulative</b> <b>mortality</b> from melanoma in the intervention areas compared with the non-intervention areas: rate ratio 1. 2 (95 % Cl 0. 9 – 1. 7) in men, 0. 9 (95 % Cl 0. 7 – 1. 3) in females. The lack of a significant reduction in melanoma mortality associated with the intervention raises questions about this approach to early detection and emphasises the need for new strategies. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign[URL]...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{exogenous}} lipid peroxides, suspected to be a cellular injury factor that causes mass mortalities of cultured Japanese pearl oysters Pinctada fucata martensii, were investigated in vivo and in vitro. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>mortalities</b> of experimental oysters exposed to oxidized oils in suspension (fish feed oil) or emulsion (methyl linoleate) were approximately 40 % after 8 or 9 weeks, whereas mortalities were 0. 0 % (suspension) and 5. 6 % (emulsion) in control oysters exposed to unoxidized oils. Pathological changes observed in experimental oysters {{were characterized by}} blebbing and necrosis of cells in various organs that had spread from the digestive organ and were identical to those observed in diseased oysters from natural mass mortalities. The thiobarbituric acid values of experimental oysters were consistently and significantly {{higher than those of}} control oysters. An in vitro exposure examination also demonstrated that oxidized oil caused conspicuous blebbing and necrosis in the epithelial cells of the digestive organ. These results suggest that organic pollution caused by suspended solids containing lipid peroxides, emulsion of oxidized oils, or both is a major environmental factor that chronically damages tissues of cultured oysters and can cause mass mortalities...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Hip {{fracture}} {{is associated}} with excess mortalities and high rate of hospital re-admission after discharge from the indexed episode. To improve related post-discharge care, we aimed to find out characteristics that were associated with related higher rates of mortality and hospital re-admission. Methods: This was a historical cohort study with following up of 273 patients recruited in a local rehabilitation hospital for 3  years. The outcome of interest was <b>cumulative</b> <b>mortalities</b> and hospital re-admissions in the 1 st 3  years after their discharge from the rehabilitation hospital. These outcomes were collected in the hospital data warehouse – the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS). Eighteen predictors, as proposed by similar studies and our own review, were retrieved from our standard clinical forms {{as well as from}} the CDARS. Binary logistic regression was used to test their association with the outcomes and to generate the respective odd ratios. Results: The <b>cumulative</b> overall <b>mortality</b> rates at 0. 5 -, 1 -, 2 - and 3 - year after hip fracture were 7. 2 %, 14. 0 %, 24. 6 % and 33. 4 % respectively, while the cumulative “ 1 st ever hospital readmission” at 0. 5 -, 1, 2 - and 3 - years after hip fracture were 29. 4 %, 41. 6 %, 59. 4 % and 71. 7 % respectively. The most significant predictors i) for mortality at 3 - year were: “Being male” (OR 5. 33), “Delayed surgery > 48  hours” (OR 2. 65), “pre-operation albumin level < 3. 5  g/dl” (OR 2. 66), and, ii) for “ 1 st ever hospital readmission” at 0. 5 -year was “Being Assisted walker or non-walker (after rehabilitation) ” (OR 3. 83). Conclusions: Characteristics that define the groups of patients with hip fractures with higher mortality and rate of hospital re-admission were identified. This could help healthcare professionals to focus on target patient groups for closer monitoring and more intensive post-discharge care...|$|R
40|$|Proliferative {{kidney disease}} (PKD) of salmonids, caused by Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, {{can lead to}} high mortalities at {{elevated}} water temperature. We evaluated the hypothesis that this mortality is caused by increasing parasite intensity. T. bryosalmonae-infected rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were reared at different water temperatures and changes in parasite concentrations in the kidney were compared to <b>cumulative</b> <b>mortalities.</b> Results of parasite quantification by a newly developed real-time PCR agreed {{with the number of}} parasites detected by immunohistochemistry, except for very low or very high parasite loads because of heterogenous distribution of the parasites in the kidney. Two experiments were performed, where fish were exposed to temperatures of 12, 14, 16, 18 or 19 °C after an initial exposure to an infectious environment at 12 - 16 °C resulting in 100 % prevalence of infected fish after 5 to 14 days of exposure. While mortalities differed significantly between all investigated water temperatures, significant differences in final parasite loads were only found between fish kept at 12 °C and all other groups. Differences in parasite load between fish kept at 14 °C to 19 °C were not significant. These findings provide evidence that there is no direct link between parasite intensity and fish mortalit...|$|R
