500|$|McAdams took a {{break from}} her film career from 2006 to 2007. [...] "There {{were a lot of}} cooks in the kitchen, a lot of voices around me, and I wanted to step away so I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> own voice again", McAdams said in 2013. [...] "Truthfully, I never really wanted to be a big movie star. I never even wanted to work outside of Canada, or outside of the theatre." [...] During that period, McAdams turned down roles in the films The Devil Wears Prada (2006), Casino Royale (2006), [...] (2006) and Get Smart (2008). In February 2006, she made a one-off stage {{appearance}} in The Vagina Monologues at St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts, Toronto to raise funds for V-Day. That same year, McAdams received a Rising Star Award nomination from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and hosted the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the strike}} broke out, Ceaușescu {{and his wife}} Elena were on a Black Sea vacation. At Verdeț' insistence, he hastily came to Petroșani on August 3. 35,000 (some sources say 40,000) came to see him [...] to be sure, not all had come to hold a {{dialogue}} with him, but went out of curiosity or carried away by events, but the audience was nonetheless impressive in size. At first, despite the charged atmosphere, some shouted [...] "Ceaușescu and the miners!", but others yelled [...] "Lupeni '29! Lupeni '29!" [...] (in reference to the Lupeni Strike of 1929, enshrined in the mythology of the Romanian Communist Party), {{in an effort to}} add legitimacy to their cause. Dobre read the list of grievances to Ceaușescu, presenting 26 demands related to work hours, production targets, pensions, supplies, housing and investments. They asked for a restoration of the status quo ante in social legislation, the guarantee of adequate food supplies and medical care, the establishment of workers’ commissions at the enterprise level empowered to dismiss incompetent or corrupt managers, and a pledge of no reprisals against the strikers. After that, Dobre recalled, [...] "While my name was being shouted, I turned toward Ceaușescu, gave him the list from which I had read and he said to me: 'Thank you for informing me, comrade'. Once in front of the microphones, Ceaușescu was not allowed to speak. Some were booing him, others shouted that they wouldn't go into the mine, and from afar one <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> name. In vain the appeals for quiet with raised arms from the activists on the podium".|$|E
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> mother {{start and}} turn, but in words {{she made no}} reply.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{should like}} to wander in the {{wilderness}} for years, if I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> from <b>my</b> family at intervals,' said Lavinia, briskly breaking open the plump, travel-worn letters.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Suzanne with mad glee, [...] "the best we <b>could</b> {{possibly}} <b>hear.</b> <b>My</b> Lord Hastings {{came to see}} maman {{early this}} morning. He said that all is now well with dear papa, and we may safely expect him here in England {{in less than four}} days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We both {{gained the}} {{opposite}} bank--I {{a few yards}} in advance. You may be sure I was not slow in bounding up the bank. I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the howl of rage with which the villains saw the failure of their plan. What is more, I <b>could</b> both <b>hear</b> and see the arrows that were sent after me, but, through God's blessing, none of them touched me, and I was soon in {{the shelter of the}} woods. I <b>could</b> also <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> friend panting at my heels.|$|R
6000|$|I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> {{mother as}} {{she went to the}} barred door and asked as to who might be there, after which came the answer, so {{distinct}} that I could catch every word: ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> mother {{moving about}} in the loft, and knew she would soon be down to cook breakfast, after which, as I {{understood}} the plan, we were to begin the journey.|$|E
6000|$|But the Professor's {{face was}} set, {{and he stood}} watch in hand, and with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> own heart beat. Presently, {{he said in a}} soft voice, [...] "Do not stir an instant. It is enough. You attend him. I will look to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bases full, {{three runs}} to tie! With Ashwell up and one out, the {{noise in the}} bleachers mounted to a high-pitched, shrill, {{continuous}} sound. I got up and yelled with all my might and <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> voice. Ashwell was a dangerous man in a pinch. The game was not lost yet. A hit, anything to get Ash to first--and then Stringer! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{felt very}} much like that, too. It was not a bit like what it was when we took that brig; I felt cool enough when we jumped on to her deck. But then there was no noise to speak of, while the row this morning was tremendous. I tried to cheer when the men did, but I <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> own voice, and I don't know whether I made any sound or not." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I couldn't {{escape from}} the {{loneliness}} of solitary confinement, not even in sleep. I would dream about sitting in my cell alone for days, forgotten and abandoned. I would cry for help and try to open the door, but no one <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> me. <b>My</b> cries often woke me up, and seeing the locked metal door, I didn't know if I was awake or still trapped in the dream. This went on for days, and I prayed for Rosewater to call me, even to beat me. At least it was human contact." ...|$|R
60|$|Then, hardly {{daring to}} look and yet unable to turn away my eyes, I saw a figure dimly {{outlined}} in the corner upon which the stair opened. There was a silence in which I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> poor heart thumping, and then when I looked again the figure was gone, and the low creak, creak was heard once more upon the stairs. Jim sprang after it, and I was left half-fainting in the moonlight.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was hired}} by Rancher Niven to help him at Gaspard's Trail, and {{remember}} {{the night of the}} fire well. Guess anybody who'd been trod on by a horse and left with broken bones to roast would," [...] he said; and proceeded to confirm Niven's testimony. This was nothing new, and the interest slackened, but revived again when the witness approached the essential part of his story, and I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> own heart thumping more plainly than the slow drawling voice.|$|E
60|$|I {{took from}} my breast that kerchief wanting the corner, and knotted it about my throat. I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> heart go; and, Alan patting {{me on the}} {{shoulder}} with some of his laughable expressions, I could scarce refrain from a sharp word. But the time was not long to wait. I heard her step pass overhead, and saw her on the stair. This she descended very quietly, and greeted me with a pale face and a certain seeming of earnestness, or uneasiness, in her manner that extremely dashed me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, that {{is where}} it is. He will say words to me which would make you weep if you <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> them. Yes, <b>my</b> darling was his heir. Archie will marry now, and will have children, and his boy will be the heir. There will be more {{division}} and more quarrels, for Hugh will hate his brother now." ...|$|R
6000|$|Leonard almost writhed himself {{beneath the}} eyes that Eustace kept {{steadily}} fixed on him. [...] "Somewhat--somewhat {{he might have}} said of knightly training for his son--but--but what do I know?" [...] he added, as his father pressed hard on his foot; [...] "it was all in your ear, for as he lay on your breast, his voice grew so faint, that I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> little through <b>my</b> helmet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't try {{to speak}} yet," [...] she said, in softer and gentler tones. [...] "Don't {{look at me}} with those doubting eyes. What wrong have I done? When Mr. Pendril wished {{to speak to you}} about Norah and me, his letter gave us our choice to be present at the interview, or to keep away. If my elder sister decided to keep away, how could I come? How <b>could</b> I <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> own story except as I did? My {{listening}} has done no harm. It has done good--it has saved you the distress of speaking to us. You have suffered enough for us already; it is time we learned to suffer for ourselves. I have learned. And Norah is learning." ...|$|R
6000|$|I didn't hurry; I couldn't if I'd a wanted to. I {{took one}} slow {{step at a}} time and there warn't a sound, only I thought I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> heart. The dogs were as still as the humans, but they {{followed}} a little behind me. When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting. I put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said, [...] "There, that's enough--put your head in." [...] I done it, but I judged they would take it off.|$|E
60|$|I didn't laugh--I {{am always}} thankful for that--but the strain {{ruptured}} every cartilage in me, and for weeks afterward I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> bones clack when I walked. She {{never found out}} her mistake. The first time she heard that form of salute used at the telephone she was surprised, and not pleased; but I told her I had given order for it: that henceforth and forever the telephone must always be invoked with that reverent formality, in perpetual honor and remembrance of my lost friend and her small namesake. This was not true. But it answered.|$|E
60|$|The carpet! It {{had been}} a stout article in its time, had evidently began in a drawing-room; then descended to a coffee-room; then gone upstairs {{altogether}} to a bedroom. The ground was brown, and the pattern was bunches of leaves and roses speckled over the ground at regular distances. I reckoned up the bunches. Ten along the room--eight across it. When I had stepped out five one way and four the other, and was {{down on my knees}} on the center bunch, as true as I sit on this chair I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> own heart beating so loud that it quite frightened me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Years before, when I {{was only}} {{eight or ten}} years old, I had met your mother with your family at the seaside, where my mother took me. I had seen {{a great deal of}} her, and knew all about her. I remembered well her {{habitual}} consideration for the nurses and servants in her employ. I knew her address in Boston, and I resolved {{to try to find a}} refuge in her family. And so there is my story. I left a note with my stepmother, saying that I was going to seek independent employment, and then went to Boston to your house. There I hoped to find a quiet asylum,--at least, till I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> from <b>my</b> aunt in Scotland. The delay of hearing from her during those two years at your house often made me low-spirited." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{few months}} later we could read in the papers the {{accounts}} of the bogus 'Emigration Agencies' among the Sclavonian peasantry in the more remote provinces of Austria. The object of these scoundrels was {{to get hold of}} the poor ignorant people's homesteads, and they were in league with the local usurers. They exported their victims through Hamburg mostly. As to the ship, I had watched her out of this very window, reaching close-hauled under short canvas into the bay on a dark, threatening afternoon. She came to an anchor, correctly by the chart, off the Brenzett Coastguard station. I remember before the night fell looking out again at the outlines of her spars and rigging that stood out dark and pointed on a background of ragged, slaty clouds like another and a slighter spire {{to the left of the}} Brenzett church-tower. In the evening the wind rose. At midnight I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> in <b>my</b> bed the terrific gusts and the sounds of a driving deluge.|$|R
60|$|That was a {{long summer}} indeed. And tho' Wilmot House was closed, I often rode over of a morning when the dew was on the grass. It cheered me to smoke a pipe with old McAndrews, Mr. Manners's factor, who loved to talk of Miss Dorothy near as much as I. He had served her grandfather, and people said that {{had it not been}} for McAndrews, the Manners fortune had long since been scattered, since Mr. Marmaduke knew nothing of {{anything}} that he should. I <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> from <b>my</b> lady until near the first of October, and so I was fain to be content with memories--memories and hard work. For I had complete charge of the plantation now.|$|R
60|$|While Maud {{was passing}} me the {{provisions}} and I was storing {{them in the}} boat, a sailor came on deck from the forecastle. He stood by the weather rail for a time (we were lowering over the lee rail), and then sauntered slowly amidships, where he again paused and stood facing the wind, with his back toward us. I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> heart beating as I crouched low in the boat. Maud had sunk down upon the deck and was, I knew, lying motionless, her body {{in the shadow of}} the bulwark. But the man never turned, and, after stretching his arms above his head and yawning audibly, he retraced his steps to the forecastle scuttle and disappeared.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I am not, sir, I assure you. No, I am not. If you <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> father sing, {{you would}} know I am not. But you never will hear him sing, because he never sings to any one but me. However tired he is, he always sings to me when he comes home. When I lay here long ago, quite a poor little broken doll, he used to sing to me. More than that, he used to make songs, {{bringing}} in whatever little jokes we had between us. More than that, he often does so to this day. Oh! I'll tell of you, father, as the gentleman has asked about you. He is a poet, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When we were {{assigned}} to our rooms Miss Stacy had to leave us. Jane and I sat together and Jane was so composed that I envied her. No need of the multiplication table for good, steady, sensible Jane! I wondered if I looked as I felt and if they <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> heart thumping clear across the room. Then a man came in and began distributing the English examination sheets. My hands grew cold then and my head fairly whirled around as I picked it up. Just one awful moment--Diana, I felt exactly as I did {{four years ago when}} I asked Marilla if I might stay at Green Gables--and then everything cleared up in my mind and my heart began beating again--I forgot to say that it had stopped altogether!--for I knew I could do something with THAT paper anyhow.|$|E
40|$|Based on "Veni Creator Spiritus", plainsong, and {{arranged}} for the Albuquerque Boy Choir, which premiered it November 7, 1998 in Albuquerque, with the composer conducting. Voicing/Instrumentation: SATB (SSAT), pno. ASCAP Title Code: 030086541. Date Composed: 1998. Copyright: 1999 Neil A Kjos Music Co (4380 Jutland Drive, San Diego, CA 92117, www. kjos. com). Duration: 3 : 33. Score/Parts: Neil A Kjos Music Co. I {{had been looking for}} a text to set for my boy choir the next season. A week before taking them to England, I was in church singing the hymn 'Come, Holy Spirit' and thinking that the spirit that children bring to music is from God. Suddenly I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> in <b>my</b> head a flowing piano accompaniment for the hymn tune [...] something to match and complement the choir's own beauty {{as well as that of}} the tune itself. Though other projects waited on the shelf, this piece was finished in a matter of hours. All of us are visited by the creative forces of the Holy Spirit all of the time. But we don't always pay attention. Digitized with funding from the Center for Regional Studies...|$|R
60|$|As for my Uncle Warrington, and his virtuous {{wife and}} daughters, {{let me do}} them justice likewise, and declare that {{throughout}} my period of trial, their sorrow at my poverty was consistent and unvarying. I still had a few acquaintances who saw them, and of course (as friends will) brought me a report of their opinions and conversation; and I never <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> that <b>my</b> relatives had uttered one single good word about me or my wife. They spoke even of my tragedy as a crime--I was accustomed to hear that sufficiently maligned--of the author as a miserable reprobate, for ever reeling about Grub Street, in rags and squalor. They held me out no hand of help. My poor wife might cry in her pain, {{but they had no}} twopence to bestow upon her. They went to church a half-dozen times in the week. They subscribed to many public charities. Their tribe was known eighteen hundred years ago, and will flourish as long as men endure. They will still thank Heaven that they are not as other folks are; and leave the wounded and miserable to other succour.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I {{went into}} the city to look upon the face of every man. But they were like the cod when they run thick on the banks, and I could not count them. And the noise smote upon me till I <b>could</b> not <b>hear,</b> and <b>my</b> head was dizzy with much movement. So I went on and on, through the lands which sang in the warm sunshine; where the harvests lay rich on the plains; and where great cities were fat with men that lived like women, with false words in their mouths and their hearts black with the lust of gold. And all the while my people of Akatan hunted and fished, and were happy in {{the thought that the}} world was small.|$|R
60|$|With that {{he began}} his search. It might have been ludicrous if I had had any desire to laugh, for the chief wore the gingerly air of a man looking for a {{rattlesnake}} which has to be got somehow. And my client assisted at the inspection with all the graces of a dancing-master. McCann poked into the forward lockers where we kept the stores,--dropping the iron lid {{within an inch of}} his toe,--and the clothing-lockers and the sail-lockers. He reached under the bunks, and drew out his hand again quickly, as though he expected to be bitten. And at last he stood by the trap with the hole in it, under which the Celebrity lay prostrate. I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> own breathing. But Mr. Cooke had his wits about him still, and at this critical juncture he gave McCann a thump on the back which nearly carried him off his feet.|$|E
60|$|The {{concern in}} which I fell {{instantly}} on this address put {{me with the}} same swiftness on my guard; and we were no sooner in the chamber, and the light made, than she beheld the old, dour, stubborn countenance of the student of Heineccius. Doubtless {{she was more than}} usually hurt; and I know for myself I found it more than usually difficult to maintain my strangeness. Even at the meal I durst scarce unbuckle and scarce lift my eyes to her; and it was no sooner over than I fell again to my civilian, with more seeming abstraction and less understanding than before. Methought, as I read, I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> heart strike like an eight-day clock. Hard as I feigned to study, there was still some of my eyesight that spilled beyond the book upon Catriona. She sat on the floor by the side of my great mail, and the chimney lighted her up, and shone and blinked upon her, and made her glow and darken through a wonder of fine hues. Now she would be gazing in the fire, and then again at me: and at that I would be plunged in a terror of myself, and turn the pages of Heineccius like a man looking for the text in church.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I reckon he did {{it pretty}} well. My heels knocked {{together}} {{like a pair of}} clappers, an' it seemed to me I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> head crack, the same way a whip does when you snap it. Well, after the old feller got through paralyzin' me, an' I was kind er steady on my feet once more, he told me to go to work an' clean out the stable. Why, Teddy, the job he set me at would have taken three men a month; an' he 'lowed I was to have it all done before night! You see, I didn't have any dinner, an' had heard so much 'bout how they lived in the country that I thought I'd kind er like to sample the cookin'. So I asked him if he didn't think {{it would be best to}} have some grub before I tackled sich a job as that. I don't know what he thought 'bout it, cause he didn't say a word; jest walked right away an' left me. Jiminy crickets! How I did sweat! But I thought to myself, I'll do my level best so he'll know he's got a mighty good man. An' I'll be blamed if when that old duffer came out he didn't act as if he thought I must have been loafin'!" ...|$|E
60|$|These {{inquiries}} took us {{up three}} or four weeks, and I was not one jot the better for it, for I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> nothing to <b>my</b> satisfaction. I sent her next {{to find out the}} honest man who, as in the beginning of my story I observed, made them be entertained, and caused the youngest to be fetched from the town where we lived, and where the parish officers had taken care of him. This gentleman was still alive; and there she heard that my youngest daughter and eldest son was dead also; but that my youngest son was alive, and was at that time about seventeen years old, and that he was put out apprentice by the kindness and charity of his uncle, but to a mean trade, and at which he was obliged to work very hard.|$|R

Do ye think I havenae broken {{my heart to}} have these braws (as he calls them, God forgive him!) thrown into the sea? Do ye think I have lived with him, day in, day out, and not seen what you saw {{in an hour or}} two? No,' she said, 'I know there's wrong in it; what wrong, I neither know nor want to know. There was never an ill thing made better by meddling, that I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> of. But, <b>my</b> lad, you must never ask me to leave my father.

60|$|July 7th. There {{was a heavy}} swell {{running all}} this day, during which the brig, being light, rolled excessively, and many {{articles}} broke loose in the hold, as I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> distinctly from <b>my</b> hiding-place. I suffered {{a great deal from}} sea-sickness. Peters had a long conversation this day with Augustus, and told him that two of his gang, Greely and Allen, had gone over to the mate, and were resolved to turn pirates. He put several questions to Augustus which he did not then exactly understand. During a part of this evening the leak gained upon the vessel; and little could be done to remedy it, as it was occasioned by the brigs straining, and taking in the water through her seams. A sail was thrummed, and got under the bows, which aided us in some measure, so that we began to gain upon the leak.|$|R
