By Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) the diagnosis can be made if adequate tissue is obtained. In such cases, lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the lobules are the key finding. Rarely, granulomatous reaction could be observed. It has been proposed that a cytologic smear primarily composed of acini rich in chronic inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells), with rare ductal epithelial cells lacking atypia, favors the diagnosis of AIP. The sensitivity and the specificity of these criteria for differentiating AIP from neoplasia are unknown. In cases of systemic manifestation of AIP, the pathologic features would be similar in other organs.|$|E

When present on shrimp farms this pathogen leads to high mortalities and economic losses. In an effort to improve the diagnosis of NHPB in farmed Litopenaeus vannamei, we compared two traditional techniques, wet mounts and histopathology with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Shrimp (n = 154) were collected from a commercial farm in Brazil with reportedly high mortalities caused by NHPB and had their hepatopancreas divided into three samples; one sample was wet mounted and examined under a light microscope for alteration in fluid color, lipid content, and tubular alteration (presence of loose <b>cells,</b> <b>atrophy,</b> melanization, necrosis, and hemocytic nodules), while {{the other two were}} fixed and preserved for histopathology (examined for hemocytic infiltration, edema, granulomatous lesions, and tubular atrophy) and PCR analyses.

The aim of the present work has been to investigate the nutraceutical properties of sweet chestnut flour extracts obtained from fruits collected from 7 geographic areas of Tuscany (Italy), and their ability in modulating skeletal muscle atrophy. We found that the cultivars from different geographic areas are characterized by the composition and quantity of various nutrients and specific bioactive components, such as tocopherols, polyphenols and sphingolipids. The nutraceutical properties of chestnut sweet flours have been evaluated in C 2 C 12 myotubes induced to atrophy by serum deprivation or dexamethasone. We found that the pretreatment with both total extracts of tocopherols and sphingolipids is able to counterbalance <b>cell</b> <b>atrophy,</b> reducing the decrease in myotube size and myonuclei number, and attenuating protein degradation and the increase in expression of MAFbx/atrogin- 1 (a muscle-specific atrophy marker).

To investigate {{the cause of this}} atrophy we have done experiments with seven series of dogs. We performed organ removals (splenectomy, pancreatectomy) and shunts (splenocaval derivation, mesenterico-caval shunt, spleno-mesentericocaval shunt). Five to eight dogs were used in each series. Hepatic biochemical tests, determination of hepatic blood flow (by 198 Au, 90 Kr, Bengal Rose, Indocyanine Green) and serial liver biopsies before and after surgery (and in the long survivals) were included in the study. Results have shown a flow decrease of 32. 3 % ± SD 12. 0 and 20. 6 % ± SD 5. 2 after mesenterico and spleno-cava derivations. Histologically, a swollen cytoplasm was encountered (probably due to this important flow decrease); but we did not find any modifications of the <b>cells</b> (<b>atrophy)</b> nor of their fat and glycogen contents.

40|$|Finasteride is a {{well-known}} inhibitor of the prostatic enzyme 5 alpha -reductase type 2 which prevents conversion of testosterone into 5 alpha -dihydrotestosterone, the active intraprostatic androgen, which causes prostate involution {{through a combination of}} <b>cell</b> <b>atrophy</b> and cell death. The drug is widely used to improve symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia in man. Clusterin, a glycoprotein which is generally up-regulated under conditions inducing <b>cell</b> <b>atrophy</b> or organ involution, is produced at a high level in the regressing rat ventral prostate following androgen ablation. According to several authors, clusterin does not respond to finasteride treatment, suggesting a different action of testosterone and 5 alpha -dihydrotestosterone. We show here that, under our conditions, finasteride was capable of inducing production of both clusterin mRNA and protein in the rat ventral prostate. In fact, by using different and converging techniques, such as Northern hybridization, in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry, we were able to show a strong induction of the clusterin gene in the epithelial cell population of the gland. The response to finasteride, which was similar to that seen with castration, occurred with a delay of a few days. In situ and immunohistochemistry experiments indicated that both orchidectomy and finasteride administration resulted in increased transition of the epithelial cells from the columnar to the cuboidal (atrophic) shape, and this was accompanied by an increased intensity of the signal for clusterin. Thus, it appears that induction of clusterin is part of the molecular process leading to prostate involution caused by either orchidectomy or finasteride administration...|$|E
40|$|A {{defect in}} protein {{turnover}} underlies multiple forms of <b>cell</b> <b>atrophy.</b> Since S 6 kinase (S 6 K) -deficient cells {{are small and}} display a blunted response to nutrient and growth factor availability, we have hypothesized that mutant <b>cell</b> <b>atrophy</b> may be triggered by a change in global protein synthesis. By using mouse genetics and pharmacological inhibitors targeting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) /S 6 K pathway, here we evaluate the control of translational target phosphorylation and protein turnover by the mTOR/S 6 K pathway in skeletal muscle and liver tissues. The phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S 6 (rpS 6), eukaryotic initiation factor- 4 B (eIF 4 B), and eukaryotic elongation factor- 2 (eEF 2) is predominantly regulated by mTOR in muscle cells. Conversely, in liver, the MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase pathways also play an important role, suggesting a tissue-specific control. S 6 K deletion in muscle mimics {{the effect of the}} mTOR inhibitor rapamycin on rpS 6 and eIF 4 B phosphorylation without affecting eEF 2 phosphorylation. To gain insight on the functional consequences of these modifications, methionine incorporation and polysomal distribution were assessed in muscle cells. Rates and rapamycin sensitivity of global translation initiation are not altered in S 6 K-deficient muscle cells. In addition, two major pathways of protein degradation, autophagy and expression of the muscle-specific atrophy-related E 3 ubiquitin ligases, are not affected by S 6 K deletion. Our results do not support a role for global translational control in the growth defect due to S 6 K deletion, suggesting specific modes of growth control and translational target regulation downstream of mTOR...|$|E

Our hypothesis was the BDNF gene delivery into the EC will produce a neuroprotective effect preventing cell lose and cell body atrophy. A perforant pathway lesion was performed in rats that severed the projections from EC layer II neurons to dentate gyrus to induce cell death or atrophy in these neurons. Three days prior to the lesion, subject received treatments into the EC. Rats were euthanized two weeks after lesion, and the brains were analyzed using stereology to quantify the number of neurons and <b>cell</b> <b>atrophy</b> by measuring cell body size. Results showed that BDNF treatment produced a neuroprotective effect that ameliorated cell loss (p< 0. 01 – 0. 05), while control groups had ~ 30 % cell loss. <b>Cell</b> <b>atrophy</b> was decreased within the AAV 9 treatment group (p< 0. 05).

The renal tissue damage was developed in most animals treated with emm 60 S. pyogenes characterized by marked IgAFcR expression and higher IgA-binding ability. By means of morphometric analysis. Significant morphological and immunochemical glomerular changes were revealed in 6 / 10 rabbits, as follows: (i) massive IgA deposition in the mesangial glomerular <b>cells,</b> <b>atrophy</b> of the capillary net, and tissue oedema; (ii) marked C 3 -complement deposition in proximal and distal tubules; (iii) a significant infiltration of cortical and medullar areas by lymphocytes associated with weak TNFα production. Noteworthy, we did not observe local IgG deposition in any cases, thus allowing to exclude any role of anti-IgG, or other IgG’s in evolution of the pathology. Alternatively, the IgA-deposits may occur due to microbial IgA FcR–IgAcontaining cоmplexes, as earlier shown by the Swedish scientists. The above tissue changes were completely absent in kidneys of control animals. Taken together, these data suggest that we have developed an experimental model similar to IgA-nephropathy in humans.

The goal of this study was to compare the inflammation induced by long-term infection of the C 3 H/He and the C 3 H/HeJ strains of mice with H. felis. C 3 H/HeJ mice are unresponsive to LPS. Six months after infection, severe atrophic gastritis had developed in the body mucosae of all infected C 3 H/He mice, with replacement of parietal and chief <b>cells.</b> <b>Atrophy</b> was associated with a loss of the H. felis from the antral mucosa.

40|$|Glial cell line-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (GDNF) and transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF-beta 3) {{are members of}} the TGF-beta superfamily with high neurotrophic activity on cultured nigral dopamine neurons. We investigated the effects of intracerebral administration of GDNF and TGF-beta 3 on the delayed cell death of the dopamine neurons in the rat substantia nigra following 6 -hydroxydopamine lesions of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum. Fluorescent retrograde tracer injections and tyrosine hydroxylase immunocytochemistry demonstrated nigral degeneration with an onset 1 week after lesion, leading to extensive death of nigral neurons 4 weeks postlesion. Administration of recombinant human GDNF for 4 weeks over the substantia nigra at a cumulative dose of 140 micrograms, starting on the day of lesion, completely prevented nigral <b>cell</b> death and <b>atrophy,</b> while a single injection of 10 micrograms 1 week postlesion had a partially protective effect. Continuous administration of TGF-beta 3, starting on the day of lesion surgery, did not affect nigral <b>cell</b> death or <b>atrophy.</b> These findings support the notion that GDNF, but not TGF-beta 3, is a potent {{neurotrophic factor}} for nigral dopamine neurons in vivo...|$|R
30|$|Bio-CuNPs induced damages via i/v route {{administration}} and showed dose-dependent trend in tissues. At TLC (11. 7  μg/kg) concentration, Bio-CuNPs showed severe {{damage to the}} liver and kidney tissues of Wistar rats. In addition, Bio-CuNPs treated via both i/v and i/p route have induced necrosis of glomerular <b>cells</b> (glomerular <b>atrophy),</b> bowman capsule and proximal tubular in group 14 th and 28 th day rats (Fig.  4 b, e, c and f) {{when compared to the}} untreated control. Glomerular necrosis is due to immunological reimbursement, but tubule damages are mostly due to toxic effect of the NPs. The tubular damage caused by the toxic effects of Bio-CuNPs through both i/v and i/p route also increased the glomerular pressure and causes glomerular atrophy.|$|R
