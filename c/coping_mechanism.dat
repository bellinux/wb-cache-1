5|$|As a <b>coping</b> <b>mechanism,</b> self-harm {{can become}} psychologically {{addictive}} because, to the self-harmer, it works; it enables {{him or her}} to deal with intense stress in the current moment. The patterns sometimes created by it, such as specific time intervals between acts of self-harm, can also create a behavioural pattern that can result in a wanting or craving to fulfill thoughts of self-harm.|$|E
5|$|The {{motivations for}} self-harm vary, {{as it may}} be used to fulfill a number of {{different}} functions. These functions include self-harm being used as a <b>coping</b> <b>mechanism</b> which provides temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety, depression, stress, emotional numbness and a sense of failure or self-loathing. There is also a positive statistical correlation between self-harm and emotional abuse. Self-harm may become a means of managing and controlling pain, in contrast to the pain experienced earlier in the person's life of which they had no control over (e.g., through abuse).|$|E
5|$|Both Dr. Lee and Dr. Evans {{attempt to}} {{diagnose}} {{what is going}} on with Michael. They both see it as a <b>coping</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and both insist that the other reality is a dream. To try to prove this to Michael, Dr. Evans has Michael read a part of the United States Constitution, as if that reality was a dream, Michael could not have done so, unless he had memorized the Constitution. Michael learned that he had alcohol in his system the night of the car accident, with Dr. Lee hypothesizing that Michael has this dream because he feels guilty for killing his son.|$|E
40|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{teaching}} is a highly stressful occupation. Teacher stress has negative impacts on classroom performance, job satisfaction, and teacher attrition. Prior {{research has been conducted}} into the causes and impacts of teacher stress; however, little research has been conducted to determine what role <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for stress play in teacher stress. This study examined the levels of occupational stress and <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> utilized by Utah secondary agriculture and non-agriculture teachers. Upon identifying <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> teachers utilized, results were analyzed in relation to demographic characteristics to determine if significant correlations exist-ed. Agriculture teachers reported higher levels of stress than non-agriculture teachers, and stress came from different sources for the two teaching populations. Results also concluded that specific demographic characteristics showed preferences for utilizing specific <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Significant relationships existed between specific <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and age, length of teaching career, and type of certification, and hours spent on teaching and teaching-related tasks...|$|R

5|$|Van Gogh's stylistic {{developments}} are usually {{linked to the}} periods he spent living in different places across Europe. He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout. His evolution as an artist was slow, and {{he was aware of}} his painterly limitations. He moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill. Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes, and that Van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a <b>coping</b> <b>mechanism</b> for when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation.|$|E
5|$|A common belief {{regarding}} self-harm {{is that it}} is an attention-seeking behaviour; however, in many cases, this is inaccurate. Many self-harmers {{are very}} self-conscious of their wounds and scars and feel guilty about their behaviour, leading them to {{go to great lengths to}} conceal their behaviour from others. They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries, or conceal their scars with clothing. Self-harm in such individuals may not be associated with suicidal or para-suicidal behaviour. People who self-harm are not usually seeking to end their own life; it has been suggested instead that they are using self-harm as a <b>coping</b> <b>mechanism</b> to relieve emotional pain or discomfort or as an attempt to communicate distress. Alternatively, interpretations based on the supposed lethality of a self-harm may not give clear indications as to its intent: life risking behaviour may have no suicidal intent, whilst seemingly superficial cuts may have been a suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This <b>coping</b> <b>mechanism</b> of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E

5|$|The {{desire to}} self-harm {{is a common}} symptom of {{borderline}} personality disorder. People with other mental disorders may also self-harm, including those with depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and several personality disorders. Self-harm can also occur in high-functioning individuals who have no underlying mental health diagnosis. The motivations for self-harm vary. Some {{use it as a}} <b>coping</b> <b>mechanism</b> to provide temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety, depression, stress, emotional numbness, or a sense of failure. Self-harm is often associated with a history of trauma, including emotional and sexual abuse. There are a number of different methods {{that can be used to}} treat self-harm and which concentrate on either treating the underlying causes or on treating the behaviour itself. When self-harm is associated with depression, antidepressant drugs and therapy may be effective. Other approaches involve avoidance techniques, which focus on keeping the individual occupied with other activities, or replacing the act of self-harm with safer methods that do not lead to permanent damage.|$|E

25|$|The {{stressor}} and the individual's {{appraisal of}} the stressor may determine the effectiveness of emotional approach coping as a mechanism for managing stress. An appraisal of a stressful situation as uncontrollable may make emotional approach coping an advantageous <b>coping</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In fact, one study of undergraduates shows that {{when faced with a}} stressor individuals appraise as more uncontrollable, {{they are more likely to}} endorse using emotional approach coping to manage it.|$|E
50|$|Other {{inhibition}} <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> include undoing, dissociation, denial, projection, and rationalization.

Many pictures can also be stored to help amnesiacs remember names of friends, family and co-workers. Notebooks, wall calendars, pill reminders and photographs of people and places are low-tech memory aids that can help as well.|$|E

The programs helped them regain an identity outside of having cancer, lessened emotional pain of their on-going fight with cancer, and also giving them hope for the future.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after moving}} into this {{location}} the people running it began subjecting Genie to extreme {{physical and psychological}} abuse, causing her language skills to rapidly regress and making her return to her <b>coping</b> <b>mechanism</b> of silence. The incident with the largest impact occurred when they severely beat her for vomiting {{and told her that}} if she did it again she would never see her mother, which rapidly accelerated her regression and made her extremely scared of opening her mouth for anything, including speaking, out of fear of vomiting and facing more punishment. As she still wanted to communicate with people she knew, she began almost exclusively using the sign language she learned while living with the Riglers. During this time Curtiss was the only person who had worked with Genie to have any regular contact with her, meeting once a week to continue testing, and she wrote that Genie's language skills severely deteriorated due to the abuse she endured. Curtiss later recalled that during this time Genie frenetically signed to her on a variety of topics, but said she could not bring herself to open her mouth so she could speak. At one point, she refused to talk for five months.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the role of <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and work stress on employeesâ€™ perceptions of organizational justice. A survey of 211 white-collar employees in the banking and telecommunications industries was taken. Multiple regression analyses were performed in order to understand the effect of <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and work stress on organizational justice. The results showed that overall perception of justice is affected negatively by work stress and positively by <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> except emotion-focused <b>coping.</b> However, sub-dimensions of organizational justice showed distinctive relationship patterns.

25|$|The {{environment}} in Genie's new placement was extremely rigid {{and gave her}} far less access to her favorite objects and activities, and her caretakers rarely allowed her mother to visit. Soon after she moved in they began to subject her to extreme physical and emotional abuse, resulting in both incontinence and constipation resurfacing and causing her to revert to her <b>coping</b> <b>mechanism</b> of silence. The incident with the strongest impact occurred when they severely beat her for vomiting {{and told her that}} if she did it again they would never let her see her mother, making her terrified of opening her mouth for fear of vomiting and facing more punishment. As a result, she was extremely frightened of eating or speaking, and she became extremely withdrawn and almost exclusively relied on sign language for communication. During this time Curtiss was the only person who had worked with Genie to have regular contact with her, continuing to conduct weekly meetings to continue her testing, and she noted the extreme deterioration in Genie's condition. She quickly started petitioning to have Genie taken out of the home, but Curtiss said that both she and social services had a difficult time contacting John Miner, only succeeding after several months. In late April 1977, with assistance from David Rigler, Miner removed her from this location.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by David Mills and David Simon based on a story by {{executive}} producer Tom Fontana, and directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal.

It {{was also the first}} episode to focus primarily on a homicide victim, rather than on the detectives.

500|$|... "Bop Gun" [...] {{was written}} by David Mills and David Simon, the later of whom wrote the 1991 non-fiction book , from which the {{television}} series was adapted. It was the first television script written by Mills, who previously worked as a reporter and became friends with Simon while studying journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park. Writing the script inspired Mills to quit journalism and start writing for television full-time. Simon felt the script's dialogue was faithful to reality, especially the detectives' use of dark humor as a <b>coping</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{for dealing with the}} horrors of the homicide unit. This was particularly embodied by a scene in which the murdered tourist's husband becomes angry after overhearing detectives talk about how much overtime they would get from the case, which Simon claimed was a conversation real-life detectives would really have.|$|E
40|$|It {{is already}} widely {{established}} {{that there are}} negative psychological effects following a traumatic event, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, there is some indication that individuals may experience posttraumatic growth (PTG) following such events. This study explores factors including <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> PTSD symptom severity, and personality characteristics {{to better understand the}} process that facilitates growth following a trauma. The sample included 271 veterans who completed surveys measuring PTSD symptoms, trauma exposure, personality traits, and posttraumatic growth. Results showed that adaptive <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were predictive of posttraumatic growth, and an inverted-U shaped relationship was found to best explain the relationship between PTSD symptoms and PTG. Among veterans with PTSD, those who experienced growth following trauma exposure scored higher on extraversion, agreeableness, openness, and lower on neuroticism and pessimism. In addition, all five subscales of the posttraumatic growth inventory were significantly correlated with adaptive <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> As cognitive <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> have been suggested to be changeable, these findings have potential implications for clinical intervention...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the correlation of <b>coping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> used by undergraduate college students throughout academic years and compare an individualâ€™s level of life satisfaction.
