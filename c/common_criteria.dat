500|$|Academic Peter Hutchings, {{noting the}} many {{definitions}} of a cult film that require transgressive elements, states that cult films are known {{in part for}} their excesses. [...] Both subject matter and its depiction are portrayed in extreme ways that break taboos of good taste and aesthetic norms. [...] Violence, gore, sexual perversity, and even the music can be pushed to stylistic excess far beyond that allowed by mainstream cinema. Film censorship can make these films obscure and difficult to find, <b>common</b> <b>criteria</b> used to define cult films. [...] Despite this, these films remain well-known and prized among collectors. [...] Fans will occasionally express frustration with dismissive critics and conventional analysis, which they believe marginalizes and misinterprets paracinema. [...] In marketing these films, young men are predominantly targeted. [...] Horror films in particular can draw fans who seek the most extreme films. [...] Audiences can also ironically latch on to offensive themes, such as misogyny, using these films as catharsis {{for the things that}} they hate most in life. [...] Exploitative, transgressive elements can be pushed to excessive extremes for both humor and satire. Frank Henenlotter faced censorship and ridicule, but he found acceptance among audiences receptive to themes that Hollywood was reluctant to touch, such as violence, drug addiction, and misogyny. Lloyd Kaufman sees his films' political statements as more populist and authentic than the hypocrisy of mainstream films and celebrities. Despite featuring an abundance of fake blood, vomit, and diarrhea, Kaufman's films have attracted positive attention from critics and academics. [...] Excess can also exist as camp, such as films that highlight the excesses of 1980s fashion and commercialism.|$|E
