25|$|Fiber {{with large}} core {{diameter}} (greater than 10micrometers) may be analyzed by geometrical optics. Such fiber is called multi-mode fiber, from the electromagnetic analysis (see below). In a step-index multi-mode fiber, rays of light are guided along the fiber core by total internal reflection. Rays {{that meet the}} core-cladding boundary at a high angle (measured relative to a line normal to the boundary), greater than the critical angle for this boundary, are completely reflected. The critical angle (minimum angle for total internal reflection) {{is determined by the}} difference in index of refraction between the core and <b>cladding</b> <b>materials.</b> Rays that meet the boundary at a low angle are refracted from the core into the cladding, and do not convey light and hence information along the fiber. The critical angle determines the acceptance angle of the fiber, often reported as a numerical aperture. A high numerical aperture allows light to propagate down the fiber in rays both close to the axis and at various angles, allowing efficient coupling of light into the fiber. However, this high numerical aperture increases the amount of dispersion as rays at different angles have different path lengths and therefore take different times to traverse the fiber.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that it is {{difficult}} to bond dissimilar metals such as aluminum and copper or aluminum and iron using diffusion bonding, because an intermetallic compound is easily produced at the bond interface and bonding strength becomes low. However it is possible to bond the dissimilar metals using the vacuum roll bonding which performs hot rolling in a vacuum. In this study, we investigated the effect of bonding temperature and reduction of aluminum plate thickness on bonding strength of Al/Cu <b>clad</b> <b>materials</b> when aluminum-clad copper (Al/Cu <b>clad)</b> <b>materials</b> were produced at 3 Pa in vacuum degree by the vacuum roll bondings. Bond tensile strength of Al/Cu <b>clad</b> <b>materials</b> increased as the reduction was increased. Their fracture types were classified according to the fracture pass, that is, in the base metal of the aluminum, at the bond interface of Al/Cu <b>clad</b> <b>material</b> or in the base metal and/or at the bond interface. Furthermore, the bond interfaces of Al/Cu <b>clad</b> <b>materials</b> were observed using a transmission electron microscope and an electron dispersive spectroscopy. As a result, it was clarified that Al/Cu <b>clad</b> <b>materials</b> are soundly produced using the vacuum roll bonding when thickness of diffusion layer is less than 60 nm even if intermetallic compounds were developed...|$|R
