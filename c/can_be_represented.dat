5|$|Any true {{physical}} color <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> by {{a combination}} of pure spectral colors. As physical colors can be composed of any number of physical colors, the space of physical colors may aptly be represented by a Hilbert space over spectral colors. Humans have three types of cone cells for color perception, so the perceivable colors <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> by 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The non-unique linear mapping from the Hilbert space of physical colors to the Euclidean space of human perceivable colors explains why many distinct physical colors may be perceived by humans to be identical (e.g., pure yellow light versus a mix of red and green light).|$|E
5|$|Bézout's {{identity}} {{can be used}} {{to solve}} Diophantine equations. For instance, one of the standard proofs of Lagrange's four-square theorem, that every positive integer <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> as a sum of four squares, is based on quaternion GCDs in this way.|$|E
5|$|For nonnegative {{integers}} n and m, {{the power}} n'm {{is the number}} of functions from a set of m elements to a set of n elements (see cardinal exponentiation). Such functions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> as m-tuples from an n-element set (or as m-letter words from an n-letter alphabet).|$|E

30|$|The {{geometric}} separation {{problem now}} is turned into recovering P and C from the observed signal f. Since curvilinear singularities <b>can</b> <b>be</b> sparsely <b>represented</b> by shearlet, they <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> sparsely <b>represented</b> by hyperanalytic shearlet, while point singularities <b>can</b> <b>be</b> optimally sparsely <b>represented</b> by wavelet. So we choose the orthonormal separable Meyer wavelet and hyperanalytic shearlet {{to construct a}} dictionary to separate pointlike from curvelike structures.|$|R

5|$|Graph {{theory is}} at its most {{powerful}} in network synthesis when {{the elements of the}} network <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> by real numbers (one-element-kind networks such as resistive networks) or binary states (such as switching networks).|$|E
5|$|Most phonemes of the Sinhalese {{language}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> by a śuddha {{letter or}} by a miśra letter, but normally {{only one of}} them is considered correct. This one-to-many mapping of phonemes onto graphemes is a frequent source of misspellings.|$|E
5|$|While a phoneme <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> by {{more than}} one {{grapheme}}, each grapheme can be pronounced in only one way. This means that the actual pronunciation of a word is always clear from its orthographic form.|$|E

5|$|Bézout's {{identity}} {{states that}} the greatest common divisor g of two integers a and b <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> as a linear sum of the original two numbers a and b. In other words, it is always possible to find integers s and t such that g = sa + tb.|$|E
5|$|Directed acyclic graphs {{may also}} be used as a compact {{representation}} of a collection of sequences. In this type of application, one finds a DAG in which the paths form the given sequences. When many of the sequences share the same subsequences, these shared subsequences <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> by a shared part of the DAG, allowing the representation to use less space than it would take to list out all of the sequences separately. For example, the directed acyclic word graph is a data structure in computer science formed by a directed acyclic graph with a single source and with edges labeled by letters or symbols; the paths from the source to the sinks in this graph represent a set of strings, such as English words. Any set of sequences <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> as paths in a tree, by forming a tree vertex for every prefix of a sequence and making the parent of one of these vertices represent the sequence with one fewer element; the tree formed in this way for a set of strings is called a trie. A directed acyclic word graph saves space over a trie by allowing paths to diverge and rejoin, so that a set of words with the same possible suffixes <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> by a single tree vertex.|$|E
5|$|Declination is {{positive}} for an eastward deviation {{of the field}} relative to true north. It can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north/south heading on a compass with {{the direction of a}} celestial pole. Maps typically include information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between magnetic north and true north. Information on declination for a region <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> by a chart with isogonic lines (contour lines with each line representing a fixed declination).|$|E

5|$|The set of all {{solutions}} to a 2-satisfiability instance has {{the structure of}} a median graph, in which an edge corresponds to the operation of flipping the values of a set of variables that are all constrained to be equal or unequal to each other. In particular, by following edges in this way one can get from any solution to any other solution. Conversely, any median graph <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> as the set of {{solutions to}} a 2-satisfiability instance in this way. The median of any three solutions is formed by setting each variable to the value it holds in the majority of the three solutions. This median always forms another solution to the instance.|$|E
5|$|Three-dimensional space <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> convincingly in art, as in {{technical}} drawing, by means other than perspective. Oblique projections, including cavalier perspective (used by French military artists to depict fortifications in the 18th century), were used continuously and ubiquitously by Chinese {{artists from the}} first or second centuries until the 18th century. The Chinese acquired the technique from India, which acquired it from Ancient Rome. Oblique projection is seen in Japanese art, such as in the Ukiyo-e paintings of Torii Kiyonaga (1752–1815).|$|E
5|$|Wang tiles are squares {{coloured}} on each edge, {{and placed}} so that abutting edges of adjacent tiles {{have the same}} colour; hence they are sometimes called Wang dominoes. A suitable set of Wang dominoes can tile the plane, but only aperiodically. This is known because any Turing machine <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> {{as a set of}} Wang dominoes that tile the plane if and only if the Turing machine does not halt. Since the halting problem is undecidable, the problem of deciding whether a Wang domino set can tile the plane is also undecidable.|$|E

5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another reason may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in their interest to prevent their notation from being read too easily. This may explain why a given star <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> by multiple glyphs. It also helps explain the combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, one would have to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In this way, the meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E
5|$|Mathematically, {{these models}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> in several ways. Petri nets, which were {{introduced}} in Carl Adam Petri's 1962 doctoral thesis, were an early attempt to codify the rules of consistency models. Dataflow theory later built upon these, and Dataflow architectures were created to physically implement the ideas of dataflow theory. Beginning in the late 1970s, process calculi such as Calculus of Communicating Systems and Communicating Sequential Processes were developed to permit algebraic reasoning about systems composed of interacting components. More recent additions to the process calculus family, such as the π-calculus, have added the capability for reasoning about dynamic topologies. Logics such as Lamport's TLA+, and mathematical models such as traces and Actor event diagrams, have also been developed to describe the behavior of concurrent systems.|$|E
5|$|More complex {{protactinium}} fluorides {{are also}} known such as Pa2F9 and ternary fluorides {{of the types}} MPaF6 (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs or NH4), M2PaF7 (M = K, Rb, Cs or NH4) and M3PaF8 (M = Li, Na, Rb, Cs), all being white crystalline solids. The MPaF6 formula <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> as a combination of MF and PaF5. These compounds {{can be obtained by}} evaporating a hydrofluoric acid solution containing these both complexes. For the small alkali cations like Na, the crystal structure is tetragonal, whereas it lowers to orthorphombic for larger cations K+, Rb+, Cs+ or NH4+. A similar variation was observed for the M2PaF7 fluorides, namely the crystal symmetry was dependent on the cation and differed for Cs2PaF7 and M2PaF7 (M = K, Rb or NH4).|$|E
