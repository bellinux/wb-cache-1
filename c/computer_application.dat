2500|$|Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield was criticised {{for being}} too focused on a hoax confessional tape that seemed to {{indicate}} a perpetrator with a Wearside background, and for ignoring advice from survivors of Sutcliffe's attacks, and several eminent specialists including the FBI, plus dialect analysts such as Stanley Ellis and Jack Windsor Lewis, whom he had also consulted throughout the manhunt, that [...] "Wearside Jack" [...] was a blatant hoaxer. The investigation {{used it as a}} point of elimination rather than a line of enquiry and allowed Sutcliffe to avoid scrutiny, as he did not fit the profile of the sender of the tape or letters. The [...] "Wearside Jack" [...] hoaxer was given unusual credibility when analysis of saliva on the envelopes he sent showed he had the same blood group as the Yorkshire Ripper had left at crime scenes, a type shared by only 6% of the population. The hoaxer appeared to know details of the murders which had not been released to the press, but which in fact the hoaxer had acquired from his local newspaper and pub gossip. The official response to the criticisms led to the implementation of the forerunner of the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System, the development of the Major Incident <b>Computer</b> <b>Application</b> (MICA), developed between West Yorkshire Police and ISIS Computer Services.|$|E
