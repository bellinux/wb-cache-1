25|$|Chemists {{frequently}} {{refer to}} chemical compounds using <b>chemical</b> <b>formulae</b> or molecular {{structure of the}} compound. There has been a phenomenal {{growth in the number}} of chemical compounds being synthesized (or isolated), and then reported in the scientific literature by professional chemists around the world. An enormous number of chemical compounds are possible through the chemical combination of the known chemical elements. As of May 2011, about sixty million chemical compounds are known. The names of many of these compounds are often nontrivial and hence not very easy to remember or cite accurately. Also it is difficult to keep the track of them in the literature. Several international organizations like IUPAC and CAS have initiated steps to make such tasks easier. CAS provides the abstracting services of the chemical literature, and provides a numerical identifier, known as CAS registry number to each chemical substance that has been reported in the chemical literature (such as chemistry journals and patents). This information is compiled as a database and is popularly known as the Chemical substances index. Other computer-friendly systems that have been developed for substance information, are: SMILES and the International Chemical Identifier or InChI.|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "silicone" [...] {{was first}} used by Frederick Kipping in 1901. He invented the word to {{illustrate}} the similarity of <b>chemical</b> <b>formulae</b> between Ph2SiO and benzophenone, Ph2CO, although he also stressed the lack of chemical resemblance due to the polymeric structure of Ph2SiO, which is not shared by Ph2CO.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{systematic}} and {{widespread use of}} medial capitals for technical purposes was the notation for <b>chemical</b> <b>formulae</b> invented by the Swedish chemist Jacob Berzelius in 1813. To replace the multitude of naming and symbol conventions used by chemists until that time, he proposed to indicate each chemical element by a symbol {{of one or two}} letters, the first one being capitalized. The capitalization allowed formulae like [...] "NaCl" [...] to be written without spaces and still be parsed without ambiguity.|$|E

6000|$|Sir Francis Norton {{had never}} been {{remarkable}} for his powers of observation, and yet he found himself watching these trifles with the keenest attention. Even the corrosion of the cork of an acid bottle caught his eye, and he wondered that the doctor did not use glass stoppers. Tiny scratches where the light glinted off from the table, little stains upon the leather of the desk, <b>chemical</b> <b>formulae</b> scribbled upon the labels of the phials--nothing was too slight to arrest his attention. And his sense of hearing was equally alert. The heavy ticking of the solemn black clock above the mantelpiece struck quite painfully upon his ears. Yet in spite of it, and in spite also of the thick, old-fashioned wooden partition, he could hear voices of men talking in the next room, and could even catch scraps of their conversation. [...] "Second hand was bound to take it." [...] "Why, you drew the last of them yourself!" ...|$|E

50|$|A <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> {{is a way}} {{of expressing}} {{information}} about the proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound, using a single line of chemical element symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, commas and plus (+) and minus (−) signs. These are limited to a single typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts. A <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> is not a chemical name, and it contains no words. Although a <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> may imply certain simple chemical structures, it {{is not the same as}} a full <b>chemical</b> structural <b>formula.</b> <b>Chemical</b> <b>formulas</b> can fully specify the structure of only the simplest of molecules and chemical substances, and are generally more limited in power than are chemical names and structural formulas.|$|R

For example, one systematic name for glucose is (2R,3S,4R,5R)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanal. This name, interpreted by the rules behind it, fully specifies glucose's structural formula, but the name is not a <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> as usually understood, and uses terms and words not used in <b>chemical</b> <b>formulas.</b> Such names, unlike basic formulas, may be able to represent full structural formulas without graphs.|$|R

50|$|Since a <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> must be {{expressed}} as a single line of chemical element symbols, it often cannot be as informative as a true structural formula, which is a graphical representation of the spatial relationship between atoms in chemical compounds (see for example the figure for butane structural and <b>chemical</b> <b>formulas,</b> at right). For reasons of structural complexity, there is no condensed <b>chemical</b> <b>formula</b> (or semi-structural formula) that specifies glucose (and there exist many different molecules, for example fructose and mannose, have the same molecular formula C6H12O6 as glucose). Linear equivalent chemical names exist that can and do specify any complex structural <b>formula</b> (see <b>chemical</b> nomenclature), but such names must use many terms (words), rather than the simple element symbols, numbers, and simple typographical symbols that define a <b>chemical</b> <b>formula.</b>|$|R
