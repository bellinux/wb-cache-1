50|$|In cooking, a chef's knife, {{also known}} as a <b>cook's</b> <b>knife,</b> is a cutting tool used in food preparation. The chef's knife was {{originally}} designed primarily to slice and disjoint large cuts of beef. Today it is the primary general-utility knife for most western cooks.|$|R

50|$|Also {{known as}} a <b>cook's</b> <b>knife</b> or French knife, the chef's knife is an {{all-purpose}} knife that is curved to allow the cook to rock the knife on the cutting board for a more precise cut. The broad and heavy blade also serves for chopping bone instead of the cleaver making this knife the all purpose heavy knife for food preparation. Chef's knives are most commonly available between 15 cm and 30 cm (6 and 12 inches), though 20 cm (8 inches) {{is the most common}} size.|$|R
50|$|Victorinox make an {{extensive}} range of chef's knives. They have been manufacturing them {{for many years}} and have made significant advancements in their design over the years. Their standard <b>cook's</b> <b>knife</b> uses a soft metal which may go blunt quicker, but allows easy and quick sharpening of the knife. They are also made very thin, allowing a better cut through many large food items, and minimises food splitting before it is cut. They also have no ricasso - the flat section of the blade located at the junction of the blade and the heal.|$|R

5000|$|The Santoku {{design is}} shorter, lighter, thinner, and more {{hardened}} (to compensate for thinness) than a traditional Western chef's knife. Standard Santoku blade length is between 6 and 7 in, {{in comparison to}} the typical 8 in home <b>cook's</b> <b>knife.</b> Most classic kitchen knives maintain a blade angle between 40 and 45 degrees (a bilateral 20 to 22.5 degree shoulder, from cutting edge); Japanese knives typically incorporate a chisel-tip (sharpened on one side), and maintain a more extreme angle (10 to 15 degree shoulder). A classic Santoku will incorporate the Western-style, bilateral cutting edge, but maintain a more extreme 12 to 15 degree shoulder, akin to Japanese cutlery. It is critical to increase the hardness of Santoku steel so edge retention is maintained and [...] "rolling" [...] of the thin cutting edge is mitigated. However, harder, thinner steel is more likely to chip, when pushing against a bone for example. German knives use slightly [...] "softer" [...] steel, but have more material behind their cutting edge. For the average user, a German-style knife is easier to sharpen, but a Santoku knife, if used as designed, will hold its edge longer. With few exceptions, Santoku knives typically have no bolster, sometimes incorporate [...] "scalloped" [...] sides, called kullens, also known as a Granton edge, and maintain a more uniform thickness from spine to blade.|$|R

5000|$|Garlic {{crushed by}} a press is {{generally}} {{believed to have}} a different flavor from minced garlic, more of garlic's strong flavor compounds are liberated. A few sources prefer the flavor of pressed garlic. Raw-foods chef Renée Underkoffler says [...] "a good garlic press makes dealing with garlic a clean pleasure. Pressed garlic has a lighter, more delicate flavor than minced garlic because it excludes the bitter center stem." [...] The magazine Cook's Illustrated says [...] "a good garlic press can break down cloves more finely and evenly than an average <b>cook</b> using a <b>knife,</b> which means better distribution of garlic flavor throughout any given dish." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cook Ting {{was cutting}} up an ox for Lord Wen-hui. At every touch of his hand, every heave of his shoulder, every move of his feet, every thrust of his knee, zip! zoop! He slithered the knife {{along with a}} zing, and all was in perfect rhythm, {{as though he were}} {{performing}} the dance of the Mulberry Grove or keeping time to the Ching-shou Music."Ah, this is marvelous!" [...] said Lord Wen-hui. [...] "Imagine skill reaching such heights!"Cook Ting laid down his knife and replied, [...] "What I care about is the Way, which goes beyond skill. When I first began cutting up oxen, all I could see was the ox itself. After three years I no longer saw the whole ox. And now I go at it by spirit and don't look with my eyes. Perception and understanding have come to a stop and spirit moves where it wants. I go along with the natural makeup, strike in the big hollows, guide the knife through the big openings, and follow things as they are. So I never touch the smallest ligament or tendon, much less a main joint.""A good <b>cook</b> changes his <b>knife</b> once a year, because he cuts. A mediocre <b>cook</b> changes his <b>knife</b> once a month, because he hacks. I've had this knife of mine for nineteen years and I've cut up thousands of oxen with it, and yet the blade is as good as though it had just come from the grindstone. There are spaces between the joints, and the blade of the knife has really no thickness. If you insert what has no thickness into such spaces, then there's plenty of room, more than enough for the blade to play about it. That's why after nineteen years the blade of my knife is still as good as when it first came from the grindstone. Chapter 3 - The Secret of Caring for Life ...|$|R
5000|$|Carbon steel: An alloy of {{iron and}} {{approximately}} 1% carbon. Most carbon steel chef's knives are simple carbon iron alloys without exotic additions such as chrome or vanadium. Carbon steel blades are both easier to sharpen than ordinary stainless steel and usually hold an edge longer, but are vulnerable to rust and stains. Some professional <b>cooks</b> swear by <b>knives</b> of carbon steel because of their sharpness. Over time, a carbon-steel knife will normally acquire a dark patina, and can rust or corrode if not cared for properly by cleaning and lubricating the blade after use. Some chefs also 'rest' their carbon-steel knives for a day after use in order to restore the oxidizing patina, which prevents transfer of metallic tastes to some foods. While some cooks prefer and use carbon steel knives (especially in Asia and the Middle East), others find carbon steel too maintenance-intensive in a kitchen environment.|$|R

40|$|Four lots of Cottage cheese {{were made}} from the same pasteurized skimmilk; three lots by a direct acid procedure, and a fourth control lot by a {{conventional}} culture method. Direct acid curd was formed by cooling the skimmilk to 4 C, acidifying to pH 4. 6 with concentrated HCl, and warming by electrical resistance to 32 C without agitation. Prior to acidification, the three direct-acid lots were treated as follows: 1 - No culture, 2 - 5 % lactic culture added and the pH allowed to reach 6. 0, 3 - Same as 2 except the pH was allowed to reach S. S. The control lot was set at 32 C with 5 % lactic culture, and cut at the A-C end point. All lots were cut with 6. 35 mm <b>knives,</b> <b>cooked</b> to 62 C in 120 min, washed, drained and creamed. Growth of lactic streptococci in skimmilk prior to making direct-acid Cottage cheese increased the non-protein nitrogen in the milk, increased the firmness and moisture content of the uncreamed curd, and significantly improved the meatiness and body and texture scores of the creamed Cottage cheese. Addition of calcium chloride, disodium phosphate, and sodium citrate to Cottage cheese milk did not improve the body and texture of direct acid Cottage cheese...|$|R

It is sufficiently terrible. On the day of your arrival, this, I learn from my Shadow, is just what happened. That night, Tu-Kila-Kila made his great feast, and offered up the two chief human sacrifices of the year, the free-will offering and the scapegoat of trespass. They keep then a festival, which answers to our own New-Year's day in Europe. Next morning, in accordance with custom, the King of the Rain and the Queen of the Clouds were to be publicly slain, in order that {{a new and more}} vigorous king and queen should be chosen in their place, who might make the crops grow better and the sky more clement. In the midst of this horrid ceremony, you and mademoiselle, by pure chance, arrived. You were immediately selected by Tu-Kila-Kila, for some reason of his own, which I do not sufficiently understand, but which is, nevertheless, obvious to all the initiated, as the next representatives of the rain-giving gods. You were presented to Heaven on their little platform raised about the ground, and Heaven accepted you. Then you were envisaged with the attributes of divinity; the care of the rain and the clouds was made over to you; and immediately after, as soon as you were gone, the old king and queen were laid on an altar near Tu-Kila-Kila's home, and slain with tomahawks. Their flesh was next hacked from their bodies with <b>knives,</b> <b>cooked,</b> and eaten; their bones were thrown into the sea, the mother of all waters, as the natives call it. And that is the fate, I fear the inevitable fate, that will befall you and mademoiselle at these wretches' hands about the commencement of a fresh season." ...|$|R
