50|$|The {{suit was}} brought for breach of <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> <b>warranty</b> of title to a {{tract of land}} in Kansas. Plaintiff in error was {{defendant}} below. Its title was derived from grants of public land {{to aid in the}} construction of a railway to the Pacific. The tract was within the location of the railroad grants, but was excepted from those grants by reason of a homestead entry and possession. Subsequent to this entry and possession, the party so in possession took title from the railroad company, and the homestead entry was cancelled. The alleged paramount adverse title was derived from a patent from the United States issued on a homestead entry made subsequent to these proceedings. The Supreme Court of Kansas found that there was a breach of the warranty, and rendered judgment accordingly. This writ of error was brought to review that judgment.|$|E

50|$|According to Covenant {{theology}} God {{makes two}} basic covenants, or agreements, with humans.

The <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace is an agreement that bases man's relationship with God on God's grace and generosity.

5|$|Covenant {{theology}} is an interpretive framework used by Reformed theologians which was significantly {{developed during the}} seventeenth century. Under this scheme, as articulated by the Assembly, God's dealings with men are {{described in terms of}} two covenants: the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works and <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace. The Westminster Confession was the first major Reformed symbol to explicitly mention the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works (sometimes called the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> life), in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience. In the fall of man, Adam broke the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. To remedy this, God offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace. This <b>covenant</b> allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God's law perfectly. The idea <b>of</b> the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace was a much more common feature of orthodox Reformed theology. The Westminster divines set these two covenants against each other as the two major ways in which God deals with people.|$|R
50|$|Concepts {{foundational}} {{to covenant}} theology {{can be found}} in the writings of Church Fathers such as Irenaeus and Augustine. Huldrych Zwingli and Johannes Oecolampadius were among the first reformers to speak of God's salvation economy under the categories <b>of</b> a <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works and a <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace. John Calvin (Institutes 2:9-11), like Heinrich Bullinger (A Brief Exposition of the One and Eternal Testament or <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> God), focused on the continuity <b>of</b> the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace, but taught the substance of what became classic covenant theology in terms of Law and Gospel. Early post-reformation writings, including Zacharius Ursinus (1534-83) in Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism (published posthumously, 1591), Caspar Olevianus (1536-87) in Concerning the Substance <b>of</b> the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace between God and the Elect (De substantia foederis gratuiti inter deum et electos, 1585), and Scottish Theologian Robert Rollock (1555-99) in A Treatise of our Effectual Calling (Tractatus de vocatione efficaci, 1597), developed the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works and <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace scheme along the lines of the law-gospel distinction.|$|R

2500|$|Through the {{influence}} of Karl Barth, many contemporary Reformed theologians have discarded the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works, along with other concepts of federal theology.

Instead, Barth argued that God always interacts with people under the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace, and that the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace is free of all conditions whatsoever. Barth's theology and that which follows him has been called [...] "monocovenantal" [...] {{as opposed to the}} [...] "bi-covenantal" [...] scheme of classical federal theology.

40|$|We {{quantify}} the economic value <b>of</b> hardware base <b>warranties</b> in the U. S. server market to manufacturers, channel intermediaries, and customers. We further decompose the value <b>of</b> a <b>warranty</b> into its insurance value and its price discrimination value, {{which are the}} two main rationales for warranty provision in the server market. We use structural modeling and counterfactual experiments to accomplish the empirical task. We derive our demand model from utility maximization, which accounts for a customer's risk aversion behavior and heterogeneity. We obtain our pricing model from the profit maximization behavior of manufacturers and downstream firms in indirect channels, accounting for the institutional realities in the server market. Our empirical analysis uses quarterly data from 1999 to 2004 on server wholesale prices, retail prices, and sales for direct and indirect channels in the U. S. market. We find that manufacturers and downstream firms benefit from warranty provision and from sorting across heterogeneous customers by offering a menu <b>of</b> <b>warranties.</b> Customers also benefit from manufacturer warranty provision {{as well as from}} the menu <b>of</b> <b>warranties</b> offered.
