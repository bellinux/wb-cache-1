25|$|In {{the eastern}} part of the Grand Canyon, the contact between the Bass Formation and the {{overlying}} Hatakai Shale is typically gradational over an interval of a meter or so. For example, in Red Canyon, the contact consists of an interval in which stromatolitic limestone of the Bass Formation is intimately interbedded with coarse clastic sedimentary rock of the overlying Hakatai Shale. In {{the eastern part}} of the Grand Canyon, the contact is sharp, but <b>conformable.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{a formal}} {{complaint}} on the shopping lens was {{filed with the}} Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK data privacy office. Almost one year later the ICO ruled in favour of Canonical, considering the various improvements introduced to the feature in the meantime to render it <b>conformable</b> with the Data Protection Directive. According to European rules, this ruling is automatically effective in {{the entirety of the}} European Union. However, the ruling also made clear {{that at the time of}} introduction the feature was not legal, among other things, since it was missing a privacy policy statement.|$|E
25|$|The Office of Vespers is {{the only}} one which has {{remained}} popular (excepting, of course, the Holy Sacrifice, which is not consider here as an Office) among Roman Catholics up to the present day. Matins and Lauds, on account of the hour at which they are celebrated, have always been more or less inaccessible to the faithful; likewise the little hours, except, perhaps, Terce, which serves as an introduction to the Mass. Vespers, on the contrary, occupies a privileged place {{towards the end of the}} day. On Sundays it is the Office most likely to bring the faithful together in church for the second time and thus becomingly completes the Divine Service for that day. It is quite <b>conformable</b> to tradition, moreover, to invest this Office with a particular solemnity. The Vesper psalms, as well as the hymns and antiphons, are well calculated to edify the faithful. Lastly, the ancient custom of having a lection or reading from the Old, or New Testament, or from the homilies of the Fathers, might well in certain cases and to a certain extent be re-adopted, or serve as the subject matter for the sermon which is sometimes delivered at this service.|$|E
500|$|In London Shirley {{met with}} Newcastle and the colonial secretary, the Duke of Bedford to discuss colonial matters and his situation. [...] Newcastle ordered the {{military}} books of Waldo and Pepperrell to be scrutinized; the analysis {{was found to}} confirm Shirley's position. [...] Shirley's accounts were also examined, and {{were found to be}} [...] "made up with great exaction", [...] "more <b>conformable</b> to his Majesty's orders ... than any other of the colonies." ...|$|E
500|$|According to a {{mid-19th century}} account, Brant's Indians {{were said to}} have {{tortured}} and eaten some of their prisoners. However, modern historians dispute this. [...] It is likely that some of the prisoners taken were ritually killed (which to Europeans is extremely similar to torture); there {{does not appear to be}} any evidence of cannibalism (ritual or otherwise). John Butler reported that four prisoners held by the Indians [...] "were <b>conformable</b> to the Indian custom afterwards killed." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{individual}} items in an m × n matrix A, often denoted by a'i,j, where max i = m and max j = n, are called its elements or entries. Provided {{that they have}} the same size (each matrix has the same number of rows and the same number of columns as the other), two matrices can be added or subtracted element by element (see <b>Conformable</b> matrix). The rule for matrix multiplication, however, is that two matrices can be multiplied only when the number of columns in the first equals the number of rows in the second (i.e., the inner dimensions are the same, n for A'm,n × B'n,p). Any matrix can be multiplied element-wise by a scalar from its associated field. A major application of matrices is to represent linear transformations, that is, generalizations of linear functions such as [...] For example, the rotation of vectors in three-dimensional space is a linear transformation, which can be represented by a rotation matrix R: if v is a column vector (a matrix with only one column) describing the position of a point in space, the product Rv is a column vector describing the position of that point after a rotation. The product of two transformation matrices is a matrix that represents the composition of two transformations. Another application of matrices is in the solution of systems of linear equations. If the matrix is square, it is possible to deduce some of its properties by computing its determinant. For example, a square matrix has an inverse if and only if its determinant is not zero. Insight into the geometry of a linear transformation is obtainable (along with other information) from the matrix's eigenvalues and eigenvectors.|$|E
2500|$|In {{evaluating}} the marble cross-section, the United States Geological Survey found the marble is bounded {{above and below}} by unconformities. This lack of <b>conformable</b> contact resulted in the early dating of the limestone as Silurian rather than the currently accepted Mississippian. The lack of <b>conformable</b> boundaries in exposures along the Treasure Mountain dome explains the variation in reported thicknesses in the quarry area west of Yule Creek of [...] about [...] southeast of the quarry. The overlying Pennsylvanian Molas Formation was an argillite unit which was converted to hornfels and quartzite. Stratigraphically below the [...] Leadville, the chert bearing Devonian Dyer Dolomite Member of the Chaffee Formation was altered by the metamorphism to impure silica-rich marble and occasional serpentine-bearing marble.|$|E

2500|$|The contact of the Dox Formation {{with the}} {{overlying}} Cardenas Basalt is smooth, planar, parallel to bedding, and locally interfingering. In places the sandstones of the Dox Formation have small folds and convolutions that {{are indicative of}} soft sediment deformation. In addition, in places, the uppermost [...] of the Dox Formation is mildly baked. A thin lava flow occurs within the uppermost part of the Dox Formation. Thus, the contact between the Cardenas Basalt and the Dox Formation is <b>conformable</b> and interfingering. This indicates that sands were still being deposited when the first lavas erupted and that deposition occurred during {{the transition from the}} accumulation of Dox Formation to Cardenas Basalt.|$|E
2500|$|The {{existence}} of angular unconformities had been noted by Nicolas Steno and by French geologists including Horace-Bénédict de Saussure, who interpreted {{them in terms}} of Neptunism as [...] "primary formations". Hutton wanted to examine such formations himself to see [...] "particular marks" [...] {{of the relationship between the}} rock layers. On the 1787 trip to the Isle of Arran he found his first example of Hutton's Unconformity to the north of Newton Point near Lochranza, but the limited view meant that the condition of the underlying strata was not clear enough for him, and he incorrectly thought that the strata were <b>conformable</b> at a depth below the exposed outcrop.|$|E
2500|$|Madison states, [...] "The latent {{causes of}} faction are thus sown {{in the nature}} of man", so the cure is to control their effects. He makes an {{argument}} on how this is not possible in a pure democracy but possible in a republic. With pure democracy, he means a system in which every citizen votes directly for laws, and, with republic, he intends a society in which citizens elect a small body of representatives who then vote for laws. He indicates that the voice of the people pronounced by a body of representatives is more <b>conformable</b> to the interest of the community, since, again, common people's decisions are affected by their self-interest.|$|E
2500|$|Hood Canal marks {{an abrupt}} change of {{physiography}} between the Puget Lowland and the Olympic Mountains to the west. [...] Based {{on this and}} geophysical anomalies it was inferred {{that there is a}} major, active strike-slip fault zone running from the south end of Hood Canal, up Dabob Bay, and continuing north on land. This is <b>conformable</b> with some regional tectonic interpretations that put a major terrane boundary between the Olympics and the Puget Lowland, and imply a connection (either via the Discovery Bay Fault, or closer to Port Townsend) to the various faults in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. [...] This boundary would be the contact where northward movement of the basement rock of the Puget Lowland against the Olympic Peninsula is accommodated; it would be expected to be a significant seismological zone.|$|E
2500|$|... "Uncover {{his feet}} and lay thee down": Singular as these {{directions}} may appear to us, there was no impropriety in them, according to the simplicity of rural manners in Beth-lehem. In ordinary circumstances these would have seemed indecorous to the world; {{but in the case}} of Ruth, it was a method, doubtless <b>conformable</b> to prevailing usage, of reminding Boaz of the duty which devolved on him as the kinsman of her deceased husband. Boaz probably slept upon a mat or skin; Ruth lay crosswise at his feet—a position in which Eastern servants frequently sleep in the same chamber or tent with their master; and if they want a covering, custom allows them that benefit from part of the covering on their master's bed. Resting, as the Orientals do at night, in the same clothes they wear during the day, there was no indelicacy in a stranger, or even a woman, putting the extremity of this cover over her.|$|E

60|$|When, as in {{this last}} syllogism, the {{conclusion}} is a proposition respecting an idea, the assumption on which it depends may be merely that {{of the existence of}} an idea. But when the conclusion is a proposition concerning a Thing, the postulate involved in the definition which stands as the apparent premise, is the existence of a thing <b>conformable</b> to the definition, and not merely of an idea <b>conformable</b> to it. This assumption of real existence we always convey the impression that we intend to make, when we profess to define any name which is already known to be a name of really existing objects. On this account it is, that the assumption was not necessarily implied in the definition of a dragon, while there was no doubt of its being included in the definition of a circle.|$|E
