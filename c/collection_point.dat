5|$|After {{leaving the}} main line {{immediately}} south of Hellingly, the railway passed over gated level crossings at Park Road and New Road. Farm Siding, a single siding on {{the west of the}} line beyond the crossings, was a <b>collection</b> <b>point</b> for the farm's agricultural produce {{in the early years of}} the railway, but later fell out of use. The line climbed most of the way from here to the hospital at 1 in 50. About halfway between Hellingly and the hospital the line entered the hospital grounds, passing to the west of Park House Siding, which served the hospital's Park House annexe.|$|E

An additional fighter on {{the east end of}} the courtyard fired, fatally wounding Gathercole. Higgins and Robinson returned fire, killing that fighter. They were joined by Sergeant First Class Jerod Staidle, the platoon sergeant, and Specialist Gary Depriest, a medic. Directing the medic to treat Gathercole, Petry was assisted by Staide and Higgins to the casualty <b>collection</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
30|$|It is {{also shown}} in Fig.  5 {{that the network}} {{performance}} improves {{with the increase of}} the number of <b>collection</b> <b>points.</b> Figure  5 a shows that the delivery ratio increases with the existence of more <b>collection</b> <b>points,</b> because the packets exhibit a better opportunity to reach the <b>collection</b> <b>points</b> with more <b>collection</b> <b>points</b> existing. Meantime, with more <b>collection</b> <b>points</b> existing, the delivery cost decreases and the delay declines, as shown in Fig.  5 b, c, respectively, because with more <b>collection</b> <b>points</b> existing, the packet can be delivered with fewer hops, thus reducing the energy consumption and shortening the delivery delay.|$|R
50|$|Another {{source is}} located in {{agriculture}} of the 20th century. Until the 1990s, in smaller communes, there were small <b>collection</b> <b>points</b> for milk. Since most farms had very little dairy, it was not economical for dairies to drive to every single operation. Thus, the milk was transported by farmers to <b>collection</b> <b>points</b> and collected there. The milk truck then drove to the <b>collection</b> <b>points</b> ordinarily every two days at a predetermined number of <b>collection</b> <b>points</b> in a fixed order and transported the milk to the dairy.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose a model for helping logistics managers to choose the appropriate location points in order to situate the <b>collection</b> <b>points</b> for used portable batteries. The proposed model has two parts: a static part and a dynamic part. We can conclude that this model helps managers in the decision of locating/modifying <b>collection</b> <b>points</b> in two ways: to add new <b>collection</b> <b>points</b> to a reverse logistics network that needs more points or to delete <b>collection</b> <b>points</b> from a network that has more points than those recommended...|$|R
5|$|Almost {{no records}} survive of the Norman {{market in the}} 11th to 13thcenturies. It is known that shortly after the market's establishment, a tollhouse was built nearby, which served as a <b>collection</b> <b>point</b> for taxes on trade. Although the precise {{location}} of the tollhouse is not recorded, it was immediately north of the market on part of the site now occupied by the Guildhall. At some point soon after its construction, the tollhouse also became the centre for the civil administration of the city. Although the Tombland market retained its charter to host an annual horse fair, over time the market at Mancroft supplanted that at Tombland as the principal market of the area. At {{the end of the}} 11thcentury, the Tombland market was removed during construction work on Norwich Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} war, Mikl {{served in the}} Volkswehr militia which was formed to resist the {{incorporation}} of his home town of Radkersburg into the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He served with the Austrian Army from 1920 until the Anchluss in 1938, when it was absorbed by the Wehrmacht, and he transferred to the German Army as an Oberstleutnant. He commanded an anti-tank battalion during the invasion of Poland and Battle of France, during which {{he was awarded the}} Iron Cross 2nd and 1st Class, and was promoted to Oberst. Through the intervention of a friend, the adjutant of Generalleutnant Erwin Rommel, under whose command he had served in France, Mickl was transferred to North Africa to command a rifle regiment. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his leadership of a kampfgruppe during the Battle of Sidi Rezegh, during which he and 800 of his soldiers were captured by New Zealand troops. Two days later he precipitated a successful mass escape from a prisoner of war <b>collection</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

40|$|Sequential {{movement}} of Aedes albopictus was observed by {{the release of}} individually marked females in Nagasaki, Japan. Three cohorts of laboratory females were individually marked and released for 3 successive days from a point in an isolated, small, grassy and scrub area in May, 1990. Human bait collection was made at 10 fixed <b>collection</b> <b>points</b> for 15 days, and collected females were checked for the mark. The marked females were released again {{from the point of}} recapture. Unmarked females collected were individually marked and released from the point where they were collected. From the repeated recapture data, sequential movements of females among 10 <b>collection</b> <b>points</b> were recorded and analyzed. Some points characterized by accumulation and/or frequent exchange of females were distinguished through the analysis. The spatial variation in the number of biting females among 10 <b>collection</b> <b>points</b> was partly explained by repeated movements among <b>collection</b> <b>points...</b>|$|R

25|$|Thermonuclear thinking: The most {{dramatic}} proposal for in situ production from deep oil sand deposits came from Richfield Oil Company. In 1959 Richfield suggested an experimental plan to release liquid hydrocarbons from the sand through the expedient of an underground nuclear explosion. The company proposed detonating a 9-kiloton explosive device below the oil sands {{at a site}} 100 kilometres south of Fort McMurray. Thermonuclear heat would create a large underground cavern and simultaneously liquefy the oil. The cavern {{could serve as a}} <b>collection</b> <b>point</b> for the now-fluid oil, enabling the company to produce it.|$|E
25|$|Haptanthus hazlettii {{has only}} been found {{in a very small}} area of {{tropical}} rain forest on the northern coast of Honduras, close to Matarras in the Arizona Municipality. After the original specimen was collected in 1989, numerous attempts were made to find the species again but without success; the area had become covered with grass following tree clearance. It was thought that the species was perhaps extinct. In 2010 an expedition organized by Alexey Shipunov and Ekaterina Shipunova found a single tree 2km from the original <b>collection</b> <b>point.</b> A few more were later found nearby. Work to conserve the species is being led by the Lancetilla Botanical Garden of Tela, Honduras.|$|E
25|$|The {{area around}} Elsenborn Ridge became a <b>collection</b> <b>point</b> for ragtag groups of American troops whose units been broken and {{scattered}} {{at the start}} of the enemy offensive. With so many troops from different units arriving in every kind of condition, organizing a coherent defense was a huge task, but one that occurred with surprising speed under the circumstances. Intelligence about the attack that reached the Americans was spotty and contradictory. General Lauer, commanding officer of the 99th, ordered Col. Robertson at Wahlerscheid to stay put until at least the next morning when more orders would be forthcoming. Robertson told his men to hold and he also prepared them for an orderly withdrawal in the morning.|$|E

25|$|Container deposit {{legislation}} involves {{offering a}} refund {{for the return}} of certain containers, typically glass, plastic, and metal. When a product in such a container is purchased, a small surcharge is added to the price. This surcharge can be reclaimed by the consumer if the container is returned to a <b>collection</b> <b>point.</b> These programs have been very successful, often resulting in an 80 percent recycling rate. Despite such good results, the shift in collection costs from local government to industry and consumers has created strong opposition to the creation of such programs in some areas. A variation on this is where the manufacturer bears responsibility for the recycling of their goods. In the European Union, the WEEE Directive requires producers of consumer electronics to reimburse the recyclers' costs.|$|E
25|$|Rideau Hall {{has long}} been a <b>collection</b> <b>point</b> for Canadian art and cabinetry. As early as the first viceregal inhabitants, the hall has held pieces by {{prominent}} Canadian cabinet makers, such as Jaques & Hay of Toronto, James Thompson of Montreal, and William Drum of Quebec. Originally, the interior decoration was heavily Victorian, with many Rococo influences. Renovations, however, have turned the interiors into predominantly Georgian spaces, with Adam and Palladian elements. Until the 1960s, the contents and colours of the house changed with each successive royal and viceroyal family; the consort typically seeing it as her duty to update Rideau Hall to suit both her personal and contemporary tastes. As there were few paintings in the palace's permanent collection, the National Gallery would provide works on loan; a relationship that continues into the present.|$|E
25|$|The International Boundary Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) developed, as a {{joint project}} of the USA and Mexico in the mid-1980s {{following}} substantial environmental studies, treats 25million gallons of water per day (mgd) from the Tijuana River; directly pumped {{across the border from}} the central <b>collection</b> <b>point</b> in Mexico. When the river is flowing, the diversion system of the plant begins operating and diverts up to about 12-13mgd to the IWTP. The total amount of water being diverted must not exceed 25 mgd, based on a monthly average decided upon by permit conditions, although the IWTP can treat sustained flows up to 45mgd daily and peaks of 70mgd for a short period. The diversion system regularly sends approximately six to eight million gallons of water daily to the IWTP. The plant is currently being upgraded to include a secondary treatment facility.|$|E
