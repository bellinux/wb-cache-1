25|$|The Václav Havel Bench is {{an artistic}} and urban utility project, created by Czech {{architect}} and designer Bořek Šípek. It's {{composed of two}} wooden garden chairs connected by a round table, which has a hole inside. A linden, national tree of <b>Czechia,</b> is growing through this hole. These benches {{can be found in}} many Czech towns, as well as in some foreign locations (Washington D.C., Dublin, Barcelona). Many benches were damaged by an act of vandalism.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} to mid-1990s, {{straight}} edge spread from the United States to Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and South America. It grew around the world due to the relentless touring of youth crew bands and the ease of ordering records from American record labels via mail. Fluff Fest, which has been held in <b>Czechia</b> since 2000 and draws audiences from across Europe, is linked to straight edge through its organizers and showcases prominent straight edge bands.|$|E
25|$|Fascioloides magna, {{also known}} as giant liver fluke, large American liver fluke or deer fluke, is {{trematode}} parasite that occurs in wild and domestic ruminants in North America and Europe. Adult flukes occur in the liver of the definitive host and feed on blood. Mature flukes measure 4 to 10cm in length × 2 to 3.5cm in width, and have an oval dorso-ventrally flattened body with oral and ventral sucker. The flukes are reddish-brown in colour and are covered by tegument. As with other digenean trematodes, the life cycle includes intramolluscan phase in snails. The parasite is currently distributed in wild ruminants in North America and Europe, including Austria, Canada, <b>Czechia,</b> Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, and USA.|$|E
500|$|The {{effect of}} commercialization {{on the music}} became an {{increasingly}} contentious issue. As observed by scholar Ross Haenfler, many punk fans [...] "'despise corporate punk rock', typified by bands such as Sum41 and Blink182". At the same time, politicized and independent-label punk continued to thrive in the United States. Since 1993, Anti-Flag had been putting progressive politics {{at the center of}} its music. The administration of George W. Bush provided them and similarly minded acts eight years of conservative government to excoriate. Rise Against was the most successful of these groups, registering top ten records in 2006 with The Sufferer & the Witness and two years later with Appeal to Reason. Leftist punk band Against Me!'s New Wave was named best album of 2007 by Spin. Politicized DIY punk also sustains active and inter-linked communities across Europe, as demonstrated by independent international events such as Fluff Fest in <b>Czechia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Partly due to {{developments}} in digital communications, {{there has been}} a rise in interaction between hardcore scenes in different places and subgenres, particularly in Europe. In September 2017, Bandcamp Daily wrote that Fluff Fest, which has been held in <b>Czechia</b> since 2000 and features an international lineup of independent bands ranging in style from crust punk to screamo, [...] "has established itself as the main DIY hardcore punk event in Europe".|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-2000s {{the style}} of early screamo regained vitality, with American bands like Comadre, Off Minor, and Hot Cross {{releasing}} records on independent labels. The contemporary screamo scene has remained particularly active in Europe, with bands such as Amanda Woodward, Louise Cyphre, Le Pré Où Je Suis Mort, La Quiete, and Raein all being prime examples of their scene. Fluff Fest, held in <b>Czechia</b> since 2000, was in 2017 described by Bandcamp Daily [...] as a [...] "summer ritual" [...] for many fans of screamo in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Most ethnic Germans fled or were {{expelled}} from European countries (<b>Czechia,</b> Slovakia, Poland and Hungary) under the Potsdam Agreement from 1945 to 1948 {{towards the end}} and after the war. [...] Both those who became ethnic Germans by registering in the Deutsche Volksliste and Reichsdeutsche retained German citizenship {{during the years of}} Allied military occupation, after the establishment of East Germany and West Germany in 1949, and later in the reunified Germany. In 1953 the Federal Republic of Germany - by its Federal Expellee Law - naturalised many more East European nationals of German ethnicity, who neither were German citizens nor had enrolled in any 'Volksliste', but had been stranded as refugees in West Germany and fled or {{were expelled}} due to their German or alleged German ethnicity.|$|E

5000|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of Czechoslovakia {{at the end of}} 1992, the Czech part of the former nation found itself without a common single-word geographical name in English. The name <b>Czechia</b> [...] was recommended by the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs (minister Josef Zieleniec). In a memorandum to all Czech embassies and diplomatic missions in 1993, the full name [...] "Czech Republic" [...] was recommended for use only in official documents and titles of official institutions. The geographical name still has not reached general recognition, but its usage is increasing. Czech president Miloš Zeman uses the name <b>Czechia</b> in his official speeches. <b>Czechia</b> was approved by the Czech government on 2 May 2016 as the Czech Republic's official short name and was published in the United Nations UNTERM and UNGEGN country name databases on 5 July 2016. <b>Czechia</b> appears on some U.S. government web pages alongside Czech Republic, and <b>Czechia</b> is included in the ISO 3166 country codes list.
