40|$|OVERVIEW: To {{protect the}} global environment, current power {{generators}} must be highly efficient {{and must be}} able to minimize waste over long-term operation. With these circumstances in mind, Hitachi evaluated the reliability of a 250 -MVA class large-capacity air-cooled generator. In this evaluation, an air-cooled generator and a large-capacity load machine were electrically connected and a rated field current was applied to reproduce field conditions. Temperature distribution in the coil slot and the coil-end was then evaluated. It was found that the stator-coil temperature rise at the specified measured points between the top and bottom coils stayed within the limitation of B class insulation; in other words, the maximum temperature of the stator coil strand was well within the permissible temperature range. Hitachi has also developed a new insulation system using “low-environmental burden epoxy resin ” for the stator coil, a key component affecting generator performance.

40|$|Cured {{epoxy resins}} {{have emerged as}} one of the most {{demanding}} industrial materials due to their properties such as high stiffness, adhesive nature and environmental stability. Their versatile nature makes it valuable with tremendous application potential ranging from sports goods to aerospace industry. Cured epoxy is a product of processed epoxy oligomer or polymer into a three dimension network generated by employing <b>curing</b> <b>catalysts.</b> The conventional <b>curing</b> <b>catalysts</b> however suffer from serious drawback of premature curing even undesired at ambient conditions limiting its pot-life. Therefore utilization of latent catalyst for thermoset applications is highly desired to extend the working life of a formulated mixture by passivating the activity of the catalyst until triggered by the external stimulus. The impetus for using latent catalysts is to impart the ability for developing the fully formulated resin systems with long storage life that can be applied directly by the end user. This, in turn, helps guaranteed consistency and improve process efficiency. To attain this, core shell encapsulation or matrix encapsulation are being currently used but they suffer from the problems like diffusion through the thermoset after release and sluggish release kinetics respectively. We have found that metal sulfides exhibit the curing of epoxy resin composite like conventionally used acid and base catalysts. Normally such catalyst start reacting immediately having limitation on the pot-life. Since metal sulfides are generally insoluble in the solvent and by homogeneously mixing with the ingredients of the epoxy resin composite their latent catalytic property cannot be effectively utilized. Metal xanthates are well known soluble precursors for the metal sulfides whose solubility can be controlled by judicious modification of alkyl chain. Just upon heating to the threshold temperature, they generate the metal sulfide in the system releasing only the gaseous bi-products. This dynamic latent capability of metal xanthates to form catalytically active metal sulfides was put to use in this current study.

40|$|International audienceSeveral {{aromatic}} dicyanate monomers {{have been}} synthesized bearing para-linked strong electron withdrawing groups, such as phenylphosphine oxide, sulfone, and carbonyl. These groups increased the reactivity of the cyanate functional groups and eliminated {{the need for}} <b>curing</b> <b>catalysts.</b> However, an undesirable decrease in the processing window between the monomer melting point and the onset of cure was also generally observed. An arylene ether phenyl phosphine oxide system was designed that displayed several attractive characteristics such as a low softening point, a wide processing window, <b>cure</b> with no <b>catalyst,</b> high Tg and high char yield in air, suggesting that these new thermosets might show good fire resistance. The dicyanate ester monomers were synthesized in high yield by reacting various bisphenols with cyanogen bromide {{in the presence of}} triethylamine.

TMETN is a liquid nitrate ester which requires stabilization with conventional free radical stabilizers such as 2 - nitrodiphenylamine, methyl-nitroanaline, or ethyl centrylite.

40|$|Ageing {{studies on}} {{composite}} rocket propellants (CRP), {{which are based}} on HTPB (hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene) binder systems, are often affected by the post-curing reaction. To obtain satisfying mechanical properties, the so called equivalent ratio NCO/OH for the curing reaction is set normally to values lower than 1. This means, there are more hydroxyl groups available from the binder (HTPB) than isocyanate groups from the curing agent are present in the mix. Nevertheless a complete conversion of the isocyanate groups during the curing reaction is hindered by the reduction of the mobility or in other words the increasing viscosity due to the curing progress. The knowledge of the curing reaction kinetics is important for ageing studies, for the assumptions of the stress-free temperature value and not at least for assessing the post-curing reaction. The value of stress-free temperature is also influenced by ageing effects. Post-curing increases the cross-link density at storage temperature, resulting in a new network part, which overlays and counteracts to the one of the main network formed at curing temperature. This effect should be minimized and the investigation of the time-temperature behavior of the curing reaction is used to determine optimal curing times. In order to separate the influence of filler particles on the curing reaction and to get basic information about the reaction, several formulations have been used: binder formulations with and without plasticizer as well as with and without <b>curing</b> <b>catalyst,</b> besides the curing of complete propellant formulations. The curing processes were followed by heat flow microcalorimetry using the heat of reaction as indicator and by pressure measurements with pressure-temperature transducers in closed pressure cells using the volume shrinkage of the material during curing as indicator...|$|E

The structural and physicochemical analyses of the various resin samples were carried out.

For the conventional UF resin (UF I), the only clear distinction between spectra for the UF resin II and UF resins (III/V) is the presence of diminished peaks for methylene groups at 2. 2 ppm. The relationship between the logarithmic viscosity of cured PF resin with time showed continuos dependence of viscosity with time during cure up to 70 minutes.

Moreover, one can pre-serve the characteristics (kneading process, mechanical properties, pot-life) of conventional HTPB binder formulations together with less sensitivity regarding formation of pyrophoric iron on inner surfaces of the propellant grain. The behavior of Butacene formulations during accelerated aging is analyzed mainly by DMA and additional results are shared with the current study. The thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA) is used to characterize SCRP for thermal expansion. But TMA {{can be used in}} part complementary to DMA as it is also sensitive to molecular mobility of the different fractions in highly filled elastomeric network. Butacene preserved insensitivity compared to a formulation with HTPB and using other materials as burning catalyst as CatoceneTM or iron oxide. The interpretation of SCRP cure kinetics is important {{in order to get the}} final product free of flaws, i. e., cracks, fissures, voids, and further on interphases with adequate mechanical properties. An important point is to be able to define final point of curing and residual post-curing time because the latter interferes with the accelerated aging and would distort the estimation of in-service time. Thus analysis of rheological and thermal cure kinetics during the evolution of liquid to gel to solid phase is investigated. The curing characteristics of such a system can be modelled in several ways in terms of viscosity build-up w. r. t. time, thermally with DSC via Kissinger method, and in Heat Flow Calorimeter (HFC) and Pressure Curing Cells (PCC).

It was hoped that the hydrocarbon - only nature of the polymer backbone, and the absence of hydrophilic <b>cure</b> <b>catalysts</b> would produce a material of low water absorption. The introduction of unsaturation has been approached in two ways. The first was to synthesize Friedel - Crafts prepolymers with ethyl side - chains. The side - chains were then tb be chlorinated, and then dehydrochlorinated to produce vinyl unsaturation. The introduction of vinyl unsaturation by this method was concluded to be unsatisfactory, due to the ease of premature crosslinking of the vinyl polymer during dehydrochlorination. The second method of introducing unsaturation was to include an allyl aromatic monomer in a F/C polymerisation. Such allyl F/C prepolymers were successfully prepared, characterised, and crosslinked. The need for a high cure temperature, and the consequent ease of oxidation make the radical cure of the allyl polymers inconvenient. They may be cured at lower temperatures, without oxidation, by cross linking them via a cationic mechanism.

40|$|Composite rocket {{propellants}} {{have often}} three-dimensional polyurethane elastomers as binders. One {{of the high}} performance binders is HTPB (hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene) cross-linked to an elastomer with an isocyanate in polyaddition reaction. It {{is essential for the}} mechanical properties of the final rocket propellant that cross-linking or curing has reached a high degree of conversion during the heat treatment of the initially liquid propellant mix. To assess the degree of curing is especially important, when evaluating and assessing the ageing. Therefore, one should understand the kinetics of the curing reaction in order to know, when residual curing during in-service time does not interfere with loss in strain capacity by ageing. Some binder and propellant mixes were investigated (1) via the reaction heat followed by heat flow calorimetry and (2) by volume shrinkage caused by cross-linking, at several temperatures in the range of 50 °C to 80 °C. The shrinkage of the volume Vg of the reaction mixture was followed in a closed pressure curing cell (PCC) by measurements of the system pressure pS. A kinetic model based on the bimolecular reaction between OH-terminated pre-polymer and poly-isocyanate was developed, which describes the heat generation rates dQ/dt and the volume change rates dVg/dt or pressure change rates dpS/dt. The equivalent ratio between OH-groups and NCO-groups is considered in the model. However, the application of the model is not straightforward in spite of the basic simplicity of the model. The reason is that the reaction of second order between two components demands the knowledge of the real start point in time of the reaction, as well as the start concentrations of the reactants. Further on, there are many handling procedures as kneading with the isocyanate, taking out the samples from the batch, transportation of samples to the laboratory, filling of measurement cells and finally the preparation of the measurement itself. During all these steps, the reaction is already in progress and a certain conversion is achieved already up to the time from where the measurement of heat generation rate or volume shrinkage is usable for evaluation. Therefore, a special modelling procedure was developed to take into consideration of all these time-temperature sections with their pre-reactions with regard to {{the main part of the}} curing reaction in the microcalorimeter or in the PCC. By this procedure, the heat flow curves dQ/dt and the pressure rate curves dpS/dt or the system pressure course pS = f(t) can be at first reconstructed and secondly described. With measurements at several temperatures, the Arrhenius parameters are obtained and conversion curves can be established. By this, the curing reactions can be assessed and suitable curing times can be defined. Further, the molar heat of reaction and the molar volume of reaction for one molar conversion of NCO were determined. The effect of <b>curing</b> <b>catalysts</b> are easily recognizable...|$|R

It was demonstrated that thermoformable paint films {{could be used to}} produce coated RIDFTed components. Coinfusion was also successfully implemented. This work also investigated the feasibility of designing and incorporating a Cure on Demand system into the RIDFT process, using ultraviolet (UV) light for the curing of composite laminates. The objective was to develop a process for the RIDFT that would eliminate or reduce the inflexibility in the current production process, resulting in shortened production cycle times. UV-cured laminates were produced {{at a fraction of the}} time required to produce catalyst-cured laminates. Mechanical and material characterization tests were performed on each of the UV-cured laminates produced. The results were referenced against those obtained for laminates produced using a <b>catalyst</b> <b>curing</b> system to determine their overall quality. The UV-cured laminates, after undergoing tensile and rheological thermal tests, were found to have mechanical and material properties comparable, or in a few instances slightly better, than that of thermally cured laminates...|$|R
