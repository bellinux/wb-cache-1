40|$|One hanging {{question}} in <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> policy and research {{is whether there}} is an artificial overrepresentation of the poor in <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> caseloads or whether this reflects the co-occurrence of poverty and need. In order to address this question, this study uses data from <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> (report, assessment, service and re-report), income maintenance, special education, hospitals, juvenile court, public mental health treatment, and census data. Poor children reported to <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> are compared to non-poor children reported to <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> and also to poor children not reported to <b>child</b> <b>welfare.</b> Poor <b>children</b> reported for maltreatment had greater risk factors at the parent and neighborhood levels and higher rates of negative outcomes than children in either comparison group. Among children reported for maltreatment, poor children have worse outcomes, both within <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> (e. g., recurrence) and outside of <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> (e. g. juvenile court, hospitalization for violence) than non-poor children. These data suggest that the overrepresentation of poor children is driven largely by the presence of increased risk among the poor children that come to the attention of <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> rather than high levels of systemic class bias. <b>Child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>Child</b> abuse Child neglect Reporting bias Poverty Cross-sector...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{a larger}} {{research}} project, we interviewed ten parents with refugee backgrounds about their experiences of contact with <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services in Norway. Despite parents describing both positive and negative experiences, and trust as well as distrust, we found that fear of the <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services was a central theme. Thematic analyses showed that fear of the <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services was not primarily related to the interviewees' own negative experiences, but to a variety of perceptions or representations of the <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services that informants described as common or prevalent among people from ethnic minorities in general. We found that the representations of the <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services could be categorized into the following themes: 1) <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services primarily take children away from parents, 2) <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services do not go into dialogue with parents, and 3) <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services discriminate against ethnic minority families. The analysis is discussed critically in light of Axel Honneth and Nancy Fraser's understandings of recognition and social justice. We suggest that the parents’ fear of the <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services can be understood as fear of experiencing humiliation and disrespect through contact with <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services; fear of losing their children, becoming invisible and being discriminated against. A key implication of the study is the need for further research that examines the fear of <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> among people from ethnic minorities, as well as measures that address distrust of services in parts of the population...|$|R

40|$|In 2004, the <b>Child</b> <b>Welfare</b> Reform (CWR) was {{introduced}} in Norway. One {{of the most important}} goals of the reform was to strengthen State level authority in public <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> and establish equal <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services across the country. The aim {{of this article is to}} study how this new reform affected the work of municipal <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> professionals and led to the development of a regional project called New <b>Child</b> <b>Welfare</b> (NCW). Based on qualitative interviews with central actors in NCW, regarding the interaction between state and local <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> professionals, the article shows how professionals within local <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> reacted on the CWR. The NCW was established as a consequence of the professionals’ reaction on state governance and represent a new type of network. Inspired by Michel Foucaults’ concepts of governmentality and self-work, the article focuses on the development of the NCW as a result of <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> workers’ confrontation with state governance and their fight for innovative solutions, knowing that the reform had direct impact on vulnerable children, youths, and their families. The local and collective self-work in NCW is an expression of a new form of productive power based on equality and cooperation, as well as a particular form of dependency between municipal and state levels of governance.

40|$|<b>Child</b> <b>welfare</b> {{services}} {{are intended to}} prevent the abuse or neglect of children; ensure that children have safe, permanent homes; and promote the well-being of children and their families. As the U. S. Constitution has been interpreted, states have the primary obligation to ensure the <b>welfare</b> of <b>children</b> and their families. At the state level, the <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> “system” consists of public child protection and <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> workers, private <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> and social service workers, state and local judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement personnel. These representatives of various state and local entities assume interrelated roles while carrying out <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> activities, including investigating allegations {{of child abuse and}} neglect, providing services to families to ensure children’s safety in the home, removing children from their homes when that is necessary for their safety, supervising and administering payments for children placed in foster care, and ensuring permanency planning and regular case review for children in foster care. Most federal dollars dedicated to <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> purposes are provided to state <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> agencies, and federal involvement in <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> is primarily tied to this financial assistance. In recent years, Congress has appropriated just above or below $ 8 billion in federal support dedicated to <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> purposes. As a condition of receiving these foster care and other <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> program funds, states must typically provide nonfederal funds of between 20 % and 50 % of the program costs, and they are required to abide by a series of federal <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> policies. Those policies focus on ensuring the safety and well-being of all children served. However, the most specific and extensive federal requirements are designed for the protection of children in foster care, especially to ensure them a safe and permanent home. Apart from the federal funding provided for programs described in this report, state <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> agencies tap significant program resources—as much as $ 5. 6 billion—from other federal funding streams, including the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), and Medicaid. These federal funding streams have federal statutory goals, or support activities, that overlap with <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> purposes. However, they are not solely dedicated to <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> purposes and states are not necessarily required to use them for those specific purposes. Neither do states need to meet federal requirements specific to the conduct of their <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> programs as a condition of receiving this “nondedicated” funding.

Malmö city's <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> board ended up handling cases that the community considered as problems related to home and upbringing. The cases varied from correction of the children's behavior by reprimand to placement in foster home or juvenile prison. Each subject was unique and different from the former, the process {{on the other hand}} was always the same. In the <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> law of 1902 focus was placed on the children, together with their parents', immoral living rather than their physical well-being.
