40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the feasibility of}} hedging volatility in <b>commercial</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>property</b> returns using mixed portfolios of public equity securities. The various components of the Russell-NCREIF Index were used as proxies for the returns series. The appraisal smoothing and lag effects in the indices were removed to uncover true returns using autoregressive methods (see Fisher, Geltner and Webb (1994)). Hedge portfolios were determined for the total national index {{as well as for}} the Southeast and West /Retail sub-indices. Hedge ratios were determined by running stepwise regressions of the property returns on a basket of securities. The resulting hedges were then tested in out-of-sample periods. The results indicate that it is not possible to hedge away risk by following this strategy. Although the R 2 s obtained from the regressions were relatively high, the relationship between the two markets appears too unstable to hold up outside the sample period. The hedged portfolios actually displayed more volatility than the unhedged portfolios...|$|E

Our study addresses this topic by analyzing a sample of 8864 repeat sales transactions between 1998 and 2010.

We find some evidence that this performance is improved by very tightly focused indices. However, controlling for property level cash flow, nearly half the variation in property price appreciation is still unexplained.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} pressure from political circles and citizens’ groups {{to ensure the}} production of urban built forms that can address both social and economic needs while respecting long-term environmental goals. This has resulted in new legislative and policy frameworks aimed at encouraging the adoption of sustainable development practices. This paper analyzes how professionals investing finance capital in <b>commercial</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>properties</b> in France are responding to such pressure. It raises the theoretical question of how sustainability goals may be internalized by investors {{in a context of}} financialization of urban production. Based on a qualitative analysis, the paper questions how property investors engage with the sustainability agenda and how this affects their organizational charts, business strategies, investment processes and day-to-day management of <b>commercial</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate.</b> The results show that FCIs have to internalize potentially contradictory objectives, i. e., countering the capital depreciation arising from new legislation by upgrading their portfolios and, at the same time, limiting their investments to maintain their profit margins. To achieve this, they both encourage their tenants to reduce energy consumption and adopt spatially selective ‘green’ investments that favor a limited number of ‘established’ markets at both intra and inter-urban levels...|$|R
40|$|CMBS (Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities) are {{securities}} {{backed by}} pools of mortgage loans on <b>commercial</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>properties.</b> The primary attractiveness of the CMBS market {{is that it}} provides liquidity and diversification to <b>commercial</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> investors and ready access to capital for commercial lenders. CMBS are structured such that a master servicer oversees {{the administration of the}} underlying loans and the distribution of the cash flows to the tranche investors. One of these functions involves the administration and disposition of troubled loans. When a loan in a CMBS deal fails to perform as expected, the master servicer sends the loan to a “special servicer. ” The special servicer has wide latitude to foreclose on the loan or modify the loan terms in an effort to maximize the cash flows to the CMBS investors. Since the first-loss investors have the most at stake when a loan fails to perform, these investors often control the appointment of the special servicer. In fact, the special servicer often holds a portion of the first-loss piece in order to properly align the incentives of the investors and the special servicer. As such, the special servicer may not be concerned with the borrower's position, but rather may undertake action...|$|R
