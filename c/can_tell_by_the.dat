500|$|The {{strength}} of the sestina, according to Stephen Fry, is the [...] "repetition and recycling of elusive patterns that cannot be quite held in the mind all at once". For [...] Shanna Compton, these patterns are easily discernible by newcomers to the form; she says that: [...] "Even someone unfamiliar with the form's rules <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the second}} stanza... what's going on...".|$|E
500|$|In October 2011, Tricky Stewart told MTV that he {{was back}} in the studio with Perry working on {{leftovers}} from their Teenage Dream sessions. He stated: [...] "Katy and I went into [...] just to address some issues with [...] records that we had done in the past that didn't end up going on , so {{we are in the process}} of just listening and freshening up things and getting ready for something special she has going on", hinting that Teenage Dream would have a re-release. Stewart also added: [...] "We always knew that the records we created were special [...] at the time it was more contractual obligation , I can only have so many songs produced by me on the album, and she honestly didn't need any more records, as you <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> success of this album, the songs have been flawless." [...] The producer later revealed one of the songs was titled [...] "Dressing Up", saying: [...] "This song is really special. It's called 'Dressing Up,' so it's going to be a big record, I think, it definitely fits. It's right there in what her sensibilities are as a musician and a songwriter. She doesn't change much. She has a very keen musical taste. It'll be really good".|$|E

2500|$|Beckett's prose pieces {{during the}} late period were not so {{prolific}} as his theatre, {{as suggested by the}} title of the 1976 collection of short prose texts Fizzles (which the American artist Jasper Johns illustrated). Beckett experienced something of a renaissance with the novella Company (1980), which continued with Ill Seen Ill Said (1982) and Worstward Ho (1984), later collected in Nohow On. In these three [...] "'closed space' stories," [...] Beckett continued his preoccupation with memory and its effect on the confined and observed self, {{as well as with the}} positioning of bodies in space, as the opening phrases of Company make clear: [...] "A voice comes to one in the dark. Imagine." [...] "To one on his back in the dark. This he <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pressure on his hind parts and by how the dark changes when he shuts his eyes and again when he opens them again. Only a small part of what is said can be verified. As for example when he hears, You are on your back in the dark. Then he must acknowledge the truth of what is said." [...] Themes of aloneness and the doomed desire to successfully connect with other human beings are expressed in several late pieces, including Company and Rockaby.|$|E
2500|$|Ringer {{said after}} the game, {{referring}} to being drafted late [...] "I {{think a lot of}} people thought I had a lot of wear and tear on me, too much, so they didn’t know how much I have left, I just kind of laughed it off. I still feel good, and I think because of all that I’ll never be complacent. I feel like I want to prove myself even more, and prove a lot of people wrong. Everything happens for a reason, though." [...] Titans quarterback Kerry Collins said of Ringer [...] "He is a good football player. Some guys are just football players, and Javon Ringer is a football player. He is patient, remarkably patient for a rookie running back. He sees blocking schemes well and has a good feel for when to cut back and when not to cut back. He has shown a lot of moves. I think the kid has a bright future.” Titans linebacker Keith Bulluck also said “He has an understanding of the game, you <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cuts he makes at times. The way he runs, and the way that he pays attention. You don’t see the coaches get on him much for messing up, so that’s big for a rookie. I’ve been impressed.’’ Tackle Michael Roos also added in, “He sees the block in progress, He can tell when a block is going to be made and he trusts that it will be made, so sometimes he is cutting before the block has even been made. You don’t see that a lot. A few people have that, and he has definitely got it. Hopefully he can get reps with the (first team) a little more and see where it goes from there.’’ ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's {{not likely}} that you're serious," [...] he objected. [...] "You are {{a young man and}} strong-limbed, I should imagine, but you've education--one <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> it <b>by</b> <b>the</b> way you {{pronounce}} your words. It's but a poor living, after all, to be made here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know who}} they are, Dick," [...] she confessed, [...] "but I know the ways of this place well, and I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you one thing--they are people of importance.

In Poole's work Parnassus, Mab is described as the Queen of the Fairies and consort to Oberon, Emperor of the Fairies.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{statements}} are most remarkable," [...] said the voice, on concluding its questioning, [...] "but you are evidently speaking the truth, {{and it is}} equally evident {{that you are not}} of Barsoom. I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>by</b> <b>the</b> conformation of your brain and the strange location of your internal organs and the shape and size of your heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> way he bites. Ha! I've got him now," [...] cried Lane, {{giving a}} quick jerk. There was a splash {{and he pulled}} out a squirming eel.|$|E
6000|$|... "'New York,' {{chips in}} the Noble Grand. 'I know,' says he, grinning. 'It ain't {{the first time}} you've seen it go down on the blotter. I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> way you hand it out. Well, explain [...] "capitalist."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the least; {{but as far}} as I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sound, {{they must}} be attacking us in force, and they seem to be working round in rear of our battery there. The sound is {{certainly}} coming this way." ...|$|E

It is useless to follow him because he has too long a start," [...] said Shadow, and he snarled again in rage and disappointment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now you're all right, ol' top. You don't have to duck nothin' for you ain't did nothin'.

6000|$|Harry chuckled. [...] "You don't want to {{get them}} mixed with the redskins of the plains, though I suppose where they're not wiped out they're pretty quiet too. These fellows are a {{different}} breed. Most of them are sailors and fishermen, and they dress {{much the same as}} you and I do. They come up these rivers now and then after the salmon, and they made this trail. You <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>by</b> <b>the</b> looks of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{looks of}} you. Look's if you'd been pulled through a knot-hole, {{as they say}} up in Molasses Gap. Heard {{everything}} that took place, didn't you? I did too. You'll get over that. I sleep like a top now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is European management, all over! An inch a day--think of that! Five {{hundred years}} to go a trifle over three miles! But I am not a bit surprised. It's a Catholic glacier. You <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> look of it. And the management." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something's {{wrong with}} him," [...] {{declared}} Patsy. [...] "He's had some sad bereavement--a great blow of some sort--and {{it has made}} him somber and melancholy.

5000|$|He {{was also}} asked, is change good, he replied: [...] "Change creates excitement. … The Green Bay Packers {{organization}} will never lack for energy. It’s {{such a great}} place to work from a culture standpoint, the passion of all the people that work here. But there’s definitely a ton of energy on the third floor right now. Today’s exciting. We’re finally all back. Everybody’s here, our staff is complete. So, you <b>can</b> just <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> response of the players and the people close to the football team, everybody’s excited about our new direction." ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{leaving the}} {{directorship}} of the Old Vic, handing over to Tyrone Guthrie after the 1933-34 season, Williams frequently accepted invitations {{to act with}} the company, for Guthrie and his successors.

5000|$|Whitney {{became the}} {{director}} of the Hauenstein Center for Presidential Studies at Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 2003.

6000|$|At {{the next}} moment Tom Coxswain stood {{at the wheel of}} the [...] "Royal George"--the Briton who had guarded, a corpse at his feet. The hatches were down.

We know, or rather do not know, the result; for who <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> whom <b>the</b> lower-deck ports of the brave ship were opened, and how the haughty prisoners below sunk the ship and its conquerors rather than yield her as a prize to the Republic! ...|$|R
