[...] Conversely, Scott Fischer, the leader of Boukreev's team who died on the mountain, had complained continuously about Boukreev's shirking of responsibility and inability to meet the demands put upon him as the top guide - complaints that were documented in transcripts of radio transmissions between Fischer and his Base Camp managers. After publication of Into Thin Air and The Climb, DeWalt, Boukreev, and Krakauer became embroiled in disagreements about Krakauer's portrayal of Boukreev. Krakauer reached a détente with Boukreev in November 1997, but the Russian climber was killed by an avalanche several weeks later while climbing Annapurna.|$|E

5000|$|Students need {{something}} complex that challenges them to explore: Students need {{to engage with}} the phenomena of study, not schematic substitutes. It is in struggling with complex problems that every learner undergoes the process of constructing their own knowledge. As learners experience internal cognitive conflicts in what they believe about the subject matter, their minds become more deeply engaged with the problem at hand. Learners' efforts in figuring out questions and puzzles are more productive than knowing the right answer because higher order thinking processes are involved. Therefore, teachers of critical exploration value the diverse efforts that students make during their explorations even where these efforts do not arrive at expected answers. In facilitating this investigative work, the questions that are asked {{over and over again}} by students and teachers alike are, for example: [...] "What do you notice?" [...] What do you mean?" [...] "How are you thinking about it?" [...] "Why do you think that?" [...] "Is that the same as what (someone else) thought they saw?" [...] "How did you figure that?" [...] "How did you do that?" [...] "How does that fit with what she just said?" [...] "Could you give an example?" [...] The responses that teachers and students give to each other might have the form of: [...] "I don't quite get it." [...] "It doesn't make sense (to me)." [...] "I don't really get that; <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> it another way?" [...] Hence, most important: It is the students who make sense and understand by trying out their ideas, explaining them to others, and seeing how this holds up in other people's and their own eyes and {{in the light of the}} phenomena itself (Duckworth, 2002).|$|E

40|$|Vol. 17, Issue 1 BTS: Your {{aim is to}} {{move the}} animal-rights debate beyond the field of ethics and into {{political}} philosophy. Drawing insights from citizenship theory, Zoopolis proposes recognizing domes-ticated animals as full citizens of our communities, treating wild animals who live outside our communities as {{members of their own}} sovereign communities, and treating those “liminal” non-domesticated animals who live within the spaces of our communities as denizens with appropriate rights. This is an am-bitious vision that would fundamentally transform our under-standing of politics and how we think about our communal life. The initial reaction of many will be that this vision is wildly utopian and impracticable.

40|$|Abstract. Now a {{standard}} {{feature in the}} translator’s toolbox, translation memory (TM) technologies come with various prices and brands, and hence different learning curves and levels of customer service. A study of messages posted to Lantra-L, an online forum for translators, reveals {{the advantages and disadvantages}} involved. Lantra-L contributors often mention gains in productivity due to repetitive texts as a key advantage, even if this has also led clients and translation agencies to seek discounts for perfect and near matches. Despite this drawback, non-repetitive texts and terminology management can also benefit from translation memories. Translators could explore opportunities for using TMs with non-repetitive texts, as this is something that neither agencies nor clients have system-atically taxed yet. “Question to those who actually use translation tools: <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> in a few words what you actually gain by using them? ” (6 March 2003 16 : 10) The question above was pasted to the Lantra-L discussion list from EST-training, a list the contributor defined as for “academic teachers, at best moonlighting as translators”. 1 It generated the short thread on Lantra-L titled “Translation Memory software +&-”. Increased productivity was the highlight among the pros, with fee discounts for repetitions the main feature among the cons. This is one of the issues the Lantra-L list deals with many times and which academic and professional literature tends to ignore (an interesting exception being Rode 2000), so it is informative {{to take a step back}} to show how it is being answered—which we will do here for th...|$|E
40|$|Red Sara, {{emerging}} Urban Landscape painter, political activist, and portrait artist {{can also}} make a mean cup of green tea. I am sitting in her window gallery sipping a cup as she buzzes around the room, telling me a bit about herself. Unremitting traffic noise from outside her studio window sounds like the scolding whirr of thousands of angry worker bees. We battle to hear each other, Red Sara clutching her mug as a shield to my probing. Our conversation ranges from discussing Picasso’s blue period; her thoughts on being labeled an “outsider artist”, to the changing installations in her window, a protest against the invasion of car sounds. “Red Sara ” is her art persona. She was actually born Sara Ross on September 17, 1971 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. After graduating high school in Toronto in 1989 she studied architecture at Carleton for 2. 5 years, later moving to Vancouver. Once here, she studied at the University of British Columbia, first enrolling in forestry, then graduating with a BA in Geography. Her focus was on human geography, the study of people in space. She has lived in Vancouver for 9 years and during my interview with her, I {{have come to realize}} that she has made much of her time in our city. Red Sara is an important contributor to the community, not just with her artwork, but also with the donation of her organizational skills. Guinevere Pencarrick (GP) : I’ll start with your landscapes.
