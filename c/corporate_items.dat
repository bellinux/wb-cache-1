40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{short notice}} surveys in accreditation programmes. Design: Two trials using short notice surveys were conducted independently: {{a study of}} 20 healthcare organizations with the Australian Council on Healthcare Standards (ACHS) and a study of 7 general practices with the Australian General Practice Accreditation Limited (AGPAL). Participating organizations volunteered. ACHS and AGPAL selected 17 and 13 surveyors, respectively, and provided training for them on short notice surveys. Methods: Each agency's short notice surveys were an abbreviated version of their current advanced notification surveys. Short notice surveys assessed accreditation programme criteria or indicators that corresponded to the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care's priority issues. Fifteen (out of 45) ACHS criteria and 48 (out of 174) AGPAL indicators that aligned to the Commission's criteria were evaluated. Participating organizations were given 2 days notice prior to the short notice surveys. Ratings from the short notice surveys were compared with those from the most recent advanced notification surveys, and statistical tests were {{performed to detect differences}} and potential confounding factors. Surveyors and organizational staff completed a post-survey feedback questionnaire which was analysed thematically and by inferential statistics. Results: The short notice survey approach overall produced ratings congruent with the advanced notification survey for both accreditation programmes. However, for both programmes short notice surveys assessed that more organizations would not reach the accreditation threshold as compared with the previous survey. Organizations in both programmes were judged to have achieved less successful performance against clinical standards by the short notice survey than the advanced notification survey. There was support from surveyors and organizational staff for short notice survey to be adopted. However, there were mixed views about the impact of short notice surveys and whether they validated trial participants' continuous improvement efforts. Conclusions: The study demonstrated that short notice surveys are more critical in their assessment of clinical than administrative or <b>corporate</b> <b>items.</b> Short notice surveys, while broadly comparable with existing advanced notification survey practice, produced different accreditation outcomes for a significant proportion of the study organizations. The overall value and worth of short notice surveys remains to be proved. 7 page(s...|$|E

We analyse the stock market reaction to the publication of press releases on a sample of 145 firms from 2003 to 2005. Results indicate that investors react positively to information concerning a firm's capacity to consolidate its position, diversify and grow. Investors react negatively to information about new product launches and upgrades. We also find that investors in companies with a strong market position and growth prospects highly value information on takeovers and internationalisation. In contrast, investors in low-performing companies value news of disposals and distribution alliances. Our results enhance the general understanding of the relevance of non-financial information to investors, {{and contribute to the}} debate surrounding the usefulness of publishing non-financial information. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{increase}} in the number of universities offering higher education has surpassed the {{increase in}} demand for higher education. Hence, the competition for potential customers, especially postgraduates, is very stiff. When the characteristics of service offering have become uniform, universities should be looking for their own competitive edge in the market to differentiate themselves from their competitors. This study attempts to investigate the influence of the corporate image of a university on the willingness of their outgoing undergraduates to continue postgraduate studies at the university (market retention) and to recommend their friends, families, and employers to engage with the university (positive word of mouth). Data was collected randomly from 872 outgoing undergraduates using self-administered questionnaires. Factor analysis or <b>corporate</b> image <b>items</b> extracted three distinct dimensions. The study renamed these dimensions as the image of a university, image of its academic programs and the external recognition received by the university. As for the studentsâ€™ loyalty, the factor analysis extracted two distinct dimensions. The study renamed these dimensions as market retention and positive recommendation. The study found that the corporate image of a university had a significant and direct effect on studentsâ€™ intention to enroll in postgraduate programs at the university. Among the influential corporate image dimensions are the image of a university and the image of its academic programs. The corporate image of a university provides a significant influence on positive word of mouth and recommendations by outgoing undergraduates to potential postgraduate customers to register with the university.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the compliance and disclosure levels of corporate governance practices of Malaysian firms under the MCCG 2012. Additionally, the study aims to deepen {{our understanding of}} the main drivers of corporate governance reporting in one of the fast developing countries in Asia. Data for 84 top companies listed with Bursa Malaysia are extracted from their 2013 annual reports. Sixty-four <b>corporate</b> governance disclosure <b>items</b> are utilised to develop a disclosure index which is taken as the dependent variable. The overall voluntary compliance and disclosure in Malaysia's top listed companies is good with an average of 77. 1 %, with minimum compliance level being 50 % and maximum being 90 %. Firm characteristics and corporate governance mechanisms are taken as the independent variables. Using OLS regression, the study finds that board size, institutional ownership, foreign ownership, profitability, and auditor size are the main determinants of corporate governance disclosure in Malaysia under MCCG 2012. The paper contributes to literature on disclosure and the reported findings are broadly consistent with the notion that good corporate governance generally leads to better corporate disclosure and transparency in developing capital markets. corporate governance; corporate disclosure; transparency; capital markets; institutional ownership; foreign ownership; profitability; auditor size; MCCG 2012; board size; compliance; Malaysia...|$|R

In this quantitative study, the effects of a core values intervention on the four leadership dimensions of House 2 Ì† 7 s path-goal theory were evaluated at a semiconductor manufacturer with a focus on the differences between supervisors and non-supervisory personnel. Data were gathered from the validated, company-developed Corporate Culture Survey that was administered pre and post intervention. Data were also gathered from a categorization task that sorted the <b>Corporate</b> Culture Survey <b>items</b> into leadership dimensions to form the dependent measures. ANOVA was used to determine whether significant changes in perceptions of leadership behavior by supervisors and non-supervisory personnel occurred on House 2 Ì† 7 s four leadership dimensions {{as a result of the}} values intervention.

40|$|As {{more and}} more {{businesses}} move online, research into the determinants and measurement of online service quality has become a research imperative (Zeithaml et al., 2000; Bitner, Parasuraman et al., 2005). Notwithstanding, {{research in this area}} {{is still in its infancy}} and much of the existing research is largely anecdotal, centering on consumer perceptions and ignoring the business customer perspective. As a result, to date, limited insights have been gained. This study represents a first attempt at addressing this gap in the scholarly literature. A two-phase study design was used to 1) explore the meaning of B 2 B online service quality, 2) identify its key determinants and 3) develop a valid and reliable measure for the construct. In Phase I of the study, 16 in-depth interviews with business customers from a range of industry sectors were conducted. Results revealed that business customers expect online service levels at least equal to that provided in offline service environments. The results also revealed that business customerâ€™s assessment of online service quality is formed across ten key determinants: Website Design, Ease of Use, Technical Reliability, Usefulness, Intuitiveness, Presentation, Accuracy, Availability, Service Reliability and Flexibility. In Phase II of the study, a measure of online service quality (OLSQ scale) was developed and empirically tested and validated from data collected from 699 customers of a large Australian <b>corporate</b> supplier. <b>Items</b> included in the measure were derived from the Phase I interviews and refined through an expert review process. Two plausible measurement models were then specified and data-model fit of each of the models examined. A second-order factor structure, comprising three dimensions, Service Quality, Web Quality and Technical Quality, consisting of 20 items was derived from the evaluation. Validity and reliability of the measure were then assessed and confirmed. Collectively, the results provide support for the soundness of the measureâ€™s factor structure and its psychometric properties. The attributes of OLSQ identified in this study provide a starting point on which providers can base the development of their online service strategy and modifications to strategy as customer needs and expectations change over time. In order to do this, providers need a valid and reliable instrument to gather information about customer service requirements and indicators of the quality of their online service offering as perceived by customers. It is envisaged that the OLSQ measure will also act as a diagnostic tool, assisting providers in pinpointing weaknesses in their online service strategy, enabling them to take corrective action where necessary. The results of this study also provide a starting point from which providers can base future research into the determinants and measurement of B 2 B online service quality...|$|R

The company {{is viewed as a}} confederation of profit making elements called Strategic Business Units (SBU) which are independent of each other and held together by a central authority. The dissertation uses a computerized simulation model of the deterministic type in a timesharing mode. The model is deterministic with some limited probabilistic The model is deterministic with some limited probabilistic effects. It is used to develop projected balance sheets and profit and loss statements for each period in a predetermined planning horizon and to evaluate the success of a set of alternative futures of the SBU. The set of SBU alternatives to be evaluated as the 2 Ì† 2 company 2 Ì† 2 may be arbitrarily chosen by the operator or chosen {{through the use of a}} near-optimal, integer programming algorithm for a variety of measurement criteria and subject to various restraints on the balance sheet. The research uses data generated by the long-range planning process at an intermediate sized, multinational corporation listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The data consist of assets, liabilities, and profit and loss statement items for each period in a planning horizon and for each of three alternatives of each SBU in the study. In addition, a beginning corporate balance sheet is required as are planned <b>corporate</b> expense <b>items</b> and the specification of operating restrictions. Research into the effect of several strategic policies, including dividend rate and debt to equity ratio, on the future prospects of the company in accordance with the optimal value of five different measurement criteria, is reported. The five measurement criteria are present value of shareholder equity, growth in earnings per share, growth in total assets, total assets and growth in sales. The appendix material contains listings of computer programs used in the model (written in the Basic computer language), the research data used, numerous computer printouts, and technical discussions on the model. Several tentative conclusions are listed, many areas for further research are suggested, and strengths and constraints of the model are discussed. It is concluded that the techniques developed have good potential for increasing cash generation and the efficiency of the investment process in a company; the dividend rate has a significant effect on how fast a company can grow; and the model is flexible and can be used for a number of investigative purposes to support company decision-makers. An interesting area for further research is the tentative conclusion that return on assets, when used as an optimization criterion, produces a significantly different set of SBU alternatives from the one which results from using the other measurement criteria...|$|R
