50|$|The building's {{prominent}} {{location on}} the river front also served as an attraction of new customers. It was seen from long distances, even from across the East River. As the Sohmers were producing product for popular consumption {{it was important that}} his factory was seen by as many people as possible, thus this location served not only as a display for inhabitants of Manhattan, but also those who passed by on the boats. The building served excellent as an eye catcher because of its scale and proportions. But the most focal point of the building of course remained the clock tower elevating above the 2 wings of the factory. This clock tower remains the most significant feature of the building. It is also most elaborately decorated part of the building. Mansard roof with curved dome is covered with decorations expressing this as the most focal part of the building.

5000|$|Inboard ski/wakeboard {{boats are}} the most popular choice for this sport as the {{propeller}} is under the boat, and are less likely to make contact with the rider. Owners of inboard boats place ballast, such as water, lead weights, concrete, or other heavy objects in different sections of the boat in order to weight the boat down and create a larger wake. The best weight configuration for wakesurfing is to place the majority of the weight near the back <b>corner</b> <b>side</b> on the side you're surfing on. The deeper the boat is in the water, the bigger the wake will be overall. In addition, you will want to place a larger amount at the stern of the boat on the side which the rider is riding. This will ramp the wake up on the side the rider is riding and washout the opposite side. A rope length of 8 to 10 feet is recommended. Wakesurf intended ropes are generally 20 feet long, making it ideal for boats that have a tower set up. Long ski and wakeboard ropes can become hazardous for wakesurfing because it usually involves winding up the rope or tying unnecessary knots. See http://www.howtowakesurf.com ...|$|E

40|$|Aerodynamic damping {{in certain}} {{conditions}} {{appears to have}} a negative value, which increases the dynamic response of a tall building. Six single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) aeroelastic models of tall buildings with typical cross sections (square, square with concave or bevel corners, and rectangular) are tested in a wind tunnel with a suburban terrain flow field condition. The along-wind and across-wind aerodynamic damping ratios of the tall buildings are identified by using the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) method in conjunction with the random decrement technique (RDT). The effects of wind speed, corner modifications (concave or bevel <b>corner),</b> <b>side</b> ratio, and wind direction on the aerodynamic damping are studied. The results indicate that in most cases the along-wind aerodynamic damping is positive and gradually increases with the increase of reduced wind speed (Ur). The across-wind aerodynamic damping is likewise a positive value at low Ur in most cases, but suddenly becomes negative when Ur becomes greater than 10. 5 for the square cross-section building...|$|E

40|$|The wake of {{asymmetric}} bluff bodies was experimentally {{measured using}} particle imaging velocimetry, laser Doppler anemometry, load cell, hotwire, and flow visualization techniques at Re= 2600 – 8500 Re= 2600 – 8500 {{based on the}} freestream velocity and the characteristic height of the bluff bodies. Asymmetry is produced by rounding some corners of a square cylinder and leaving others unrounded. It is found that, with increasing corner radius, the flow reversal region is expanded, and the vortex formation length is prolonged. Accordingly, the vortex shedding frequency increases and the base pressure rises, resulting in {{a reduction in the}} mean drag as well as the fluctuating drag and lift. It is further found that, while the asymmetric cross section of the cylinder causes the wake centerline to shift toward the sharp <b>corner</b> <b>side</b> of the bluff body, the wake remains globally symmetric about the shifted centerline. The near wake of asymmetric bluff bodies is characterized in detail, including the Reynolds stresses, characteristic velocity, and length scale, and is further compared with that of the symmetric ones.

40|$|The {{collective}} {{electronic excitation}} in planar sodium clusters is studied by time-dependent density functional theory calculations. The formation {{and development of}} the resonances in photoabsorption spectra are investigated in terms of the shape and size of the 2 -dimensional (2 -D) systems. The nature of these resonances is revealed by the frequency-resolved induced charge densities present on a real-space grid. For long double chains, the excitation is similar to that in long single atomic chains, showing longitudinal modes, end and central transverse modes. However, for 2 -D planes consisting of (n × n) atoms with n up to 16, new 2 -D characteristic modes emerge regardless of the symmetries considered. For a kick parallel to the plane, besides the equivalent end mode, mixed modes with contrary polarity occur, while for an impulse perpendicular to the plane there will be <b>corner,</b> <b>side</b> center, bulk center, and circuit modes.

40|$|Introduction: Anthropometric {{proportions}} and symmetry {{are considered}} determinants of beauty. These parameters have significant importance in facial plastic surgery, particularly in rhinoplasty. As the central {{organ of the}} face, the nose is especially important in determining facial symmetry, both through the perception of a crooked nose and through the determination of facial growth. The evaluation {{of the presence of}} facial asymmetry has great relevance preoperatively, both for surgical planning and counseling. Aim/Objective: To evaluate and document the presence of facial asymmetry in patients during rhinoplasty planning and to correlate the anthropometric measures with the perception of facial symmetry or asymmetry, assessing whether there is a higher prevalence of facial asymmetry in these patients compared to volunteers without nasal complaints. Methods: This prospective study was performed by comparing photographs of patients with rhinoplasty planning and volunteers (controls), n = 201, and by evaluating of anthropometric measurements taken from a line passing {{through the center of the}} face, until tragus, medial canthus, <b>corner</b> <b>side</b> wing margin, and oral commissure of each side, by statistical analysis (Z test and odds ratio). Results: None of the patients or volunteers had completely symmetric values. Subjectively, 59 % of patients were perceived as asymmetric, against 54 % of volunteers. Objectively, more than 89 % of respondents had asymmetrical measures. Patients had greater RLMTr (MidLine Tragus Ratio) asymmetry than volunteers, which was statistically significant. Discussion/Conclusion: Facial asymmetries are very common in patients seeking rhinoplasty, and special attention should be paid to these aspects both for surgical planning and for counseling of patients...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a materials and computational model based analysis utilized to design an engineered “overpack” container capable of maintaining structural integrity for confinement of transuranic wastes undergoing the cryo-vacuum stress based “Bag-Buster” process and satisfying DOT 7 A waste package requirements. The engineered overpack {{is a key}} component of the “Ultra-BagBuster” process/system being commercially developed by UltraTech International for potential DOE applications to non-intrusively breach inner confinement layers (poly bags/packaging) within transuranic (TRU) waste drums. This system provides a lower cost/risk approach to mitigate hydrogen gas concentration buildup limitations on transport of high alpha activity organic transuranic wastes. Four evolving overpack design configurations and two materials (low carbon steel and 300 series stainless) were considered and evaluated using non-linear finite element model analyses of structural response. Properties comparisons show that 300 -series stainless is required to provide assurance of ductility and structural integrity at both room and cryogenic temperatures. The overpack designs were analyzed for five accidental drop impact orientations onto an unyielding surface (dropped flat on bottom, bottom <b>corner,</b> <b>side,</b> top corner, and top). The first three design configurations failed the bottom and top corner drop orientations (flat bottom, top, and side plates breached or underwent material failure). The fourth design utilized a protruding rim-ring (skirt) below the overpack’s bottom plate and above the overpack’s lid plate to absorb much of the impact energy and maintained structural integrity under all accidental drop loads at both room and cryogenic temperature conditions. Selected drop testing of the final design will be required to confirm design performance...|$|E
40|$|Eldon unifaces are unifacially flaked stone tool {{artifacts}} that {{are unique to}} the Canadian Plains of the early-Middle Period (7, 500 - 4, 500 ya). They are unique because cortex covers the ventral side. The artifacts also have a suit of traits such as being thinned (or {{an attempt was made}} to thin), unifically flaked, and there is a preference for them to be made from large quartzite cobbles. Further morphological traits indicate that there are four related types of these tools: Classic, <b>Corner,</b> <b>Side,</b> and Amorphous; the first two are the focus of this thesis. Design theory and Châine Opératoire are used to study how the artifacts were made and used. Other geographic regions are sought for similar artifact forms: Manitoba, Eastern Woodlands /Maritimes, and British Columbia. It is the cobble spall tools from British Columbia that has the most striking similarity in morphology and manufacturing strategy. There are also important differences like in how Eldon unifaces are more heterogeneous and circumscribed to a shorter period of time than the British Columbia artifacts. A morphological and usewear analysis is undertaken to ascertain the function of Classic and Corner Eldon unifaces. The morphological analysis indicates that the tools were likely used to process medium to hard materials; however, the literature is rife with contraditctions on how to relate morphology with function. This questioned the reliability of a morphological approach to function and indicated that it needed to be supported by a usewear approach. The usewear analysis supported the inferences of the tools working medium to hard materials and also indicated how the tools were used (motion). Further, the usewear and morphological analyses also indicated that the Eldon unifaces were likely hafted...|$|E
