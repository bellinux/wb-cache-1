5|$|Following the Spanish–American War, {{which gave}} Cuba its {{independence}} from Spain, many anarchists were dissatisfied with the conditions that persisted after independence. They cited conditions that were perpetuated by the new government, like suppression of labor movements, US occupations, and dissatisfaction with the school systems. By 1899, anarchist workers had reorganized themselves, under the Alianza de Trabajadores (Worker's Alliance). By September of this year, five of the groups organizers had been arrested, following a mason's strike which spread {{to all of the}} construction trade. Around this time, anarchist organizer Errico Malatesta visited Cuba, giving speeches, and interviews to several periodicals, but was soon barred from further speaking engagements by <b>civil</b> <b>governor</b> Emilio Nuñez. Around 1902-03, anarchists and other labor organizers began to attempt to organize the sugar industry, then the largest industry in Cuba. But owners responded quickly, and two workers were murdered, and the crimes never solved.|$|E

25|$|In the Roman Republic, {{military}} command, or imperium, {{could be}} exercised constitutionally {{only by a}} consul. There were two consuls at a time, each elected to a one-year term.

This custom allowed for continuity of command despite the high turnover of consuls. In the Roman Empire, proconsul was a title held by a <b>civil</b> <b>governor</b> and did not imply military command.|$|E
