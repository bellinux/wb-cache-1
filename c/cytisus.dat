25|$|Within the {{heathland}} areas, {{the predominant}} community types are Calluna vulgaris (common heather)–Deschampsia flexuosa (wavy hair grass) (H9) and heather–Ulex gallii (western gorse) (H8). Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) is also widespread, with some patches of bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), and less frequently bell heather (Erica cinerea), cross leaved heath (Erica tetralix) and broom (<b>Cytisus</b> scoparius).|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{invasive}} plant species inhabit the Peter Murrell Conservation Area and threaten native vegetation. These invasive plant species include gorse (Ulex europeaus), Spanish heath (Erica lusitanica), English broom (<b>Cytisus</b> scoparius), canary broom (Genista monspessulana), boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera), blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), blue-butterfly-bush (Psoralea pinnata) and introduced wattles (Acacia spp.). Invasive {{species such as}} these can threaten ecosystems as they can displace native species, contribute to land degradation and lessen overall productivity.|$|E
25|$|The goal is an {{economically}} viable process {{that could be}} included in modern agriculture practices. Average poor tropical soils are easily enrichable to terra preta nova {{by the addition of}} crumbled charcoal and condensed smoke. Terra preta may be an important avenue of future carbon sequestration while reversing the current worldwide decline in soil fertility and associated desertification. Whether this is possible on a larger scale has yet to be proven. Tree Lucerne (tagasaste or <b>Cytisus</b> proliferus) is one type of Fertilizer tree used to make Terra preta. Efforts to recreate these soils are being undertaken by State owned companies such as Embrapa and other organizations in Brazil. Academic research efforts continue.|$|E
25|$|On Hesselberg {{all forms}} (high forest, coppice-with-standards, coppice) and types (temperate {{coniferous}} forest, mixed forest, deciduous forest) of forests can be found. The coppice {{in the upper}} regions of the northern slope has the strangest appearance. After coppicing more light reaches the ground and thermophile animals such as the sand lizard thrive. Later, when the canopy closes again, many other specialised animals such as the Eurasian woodcock find a suitable habitat. All game that is typical of German forests (for example hare, roe, red fox, and squirrel) are present in Hesselberg's woods. The drumming of woodpeckers and the crying of cuckoos contribute to {{the mood of the}} wood as well as the singing of countless birds. Various Ranunculaceae—such as liverworts and wood anemones—are the signs of spring in Hesselberg's forests. In May ramsons turn the ground of the deciduous forest into a carpet of green and white blooms. After blooming the intense odour of garlic fills the air. The various species of orchids such as the red helleborine have become increasingly rare. The Turk's-cap lily, which belongs to the lily family, can still be found relatively often but flower's diversity is in need of protection. The erica and the <b>Cytisus</b> scoparius prefer the iron sandstone layers of the lower parts of the slopes.|$|E
500|$|Across its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater {{is found}} {{in a range of}} habitats—in open sclerophyll forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in {{riparian}} woodlands. [...] It most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum (Corymbia maculata) with ironbarks and stringybarks such as narrow-leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus crebra) and silver-leaved ironbark (E. melanophloia), with a light shrubby understorey, and less often in dry open forests and woodlands dominated by Angophora, Acacia, Banksia, Casuarina or Callitris, or in high-altitude, tall, open forests of alpine ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis) and woodlands dominated by snow gum (E. pauciflora) or white box (E. albens). It has been recorded in coastal heath when banksias are blooming, and among flowering mangroves. It occupies areas infested with weeds such as Scotch broom (<b>Cytisus</b> scoparius) and blackberries, and developed areas including orchards and parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers. It can be found in forests regenerating after fire or logging, though it is more common in mature forests. Where it {{is found in}} woodland, it is usually woodland near forest or with an understory of sclerophyll plants.|$|E
2500|$|Siliceous {{mountains}} {{such as the}} Sistema Central, Serra da Estrela, the Sistema Ibérico of {{the region}} of Soria, {{and parts of the}} Cantabrian mountains, are covered by thickets of <b>Cytisus</b> purgans (variously known as [...] "Andorra broom", [...] "Provence broom", or [...] "Spanish gold hardy broom") or Alpine juniper (Juniperus communis subsp. alpina). In the Sierra Nevada, on the other hand, under similar conditions, the Genista baetica, is more dominant, sometimes accompanied by <b>Cytisus</b> purgans and another species of juniper (J. communis subsp. hemisphaerica).|$|E
2500|$|Forests of Algerian oaks (Quercus canariensis) {{are well}} {{represented}} in western Andalusia and very patchily by hybridizations in Catalonia and the Cordillera Mariánica. They {{are the most}} demanding as to temperature and humidity, and therefore do not usually stray too far from areas with a maritime climate; they prefer the cooler, shady northward slopes, damp meadows and the banks of streams of the lower ground. In general, they alternate with the Cork Oaks, which they displace in the coolest zones; both prefer siliceous soils. In the clearings and degraded stages of these forests los piornos (Teline sp., <b>Cytisus</b> baeticus), heather (Erica arborea, Erica scoparia), and [...] rock rose (Halimium lasianthum) are common.|$|E

60|$|Before {{giving a}} summary on Bud-variation I will discuss some {{singular}} and anomalous cases, {{which are more}} or less closely related to this same subject. I will begin with the famous case of Adam's laburnum or <b>Cytisus</b> adami, a form or hybrid intermediate between two very distinct species, namely, C. laburnum and purpureus, the common and purple laburnum; but as this tree has often been described, I will be as brief as I can.|$|E

60|$|I will {{therefore}} give {{all the facts}} which I {{have been able to}} collect on the formation of hybrids between distinct species or varieties, without the intervention of the sexual organs. For if, as I am now convinced, this is possible, it is a most important fact, which will sooner or later change the views held by physiologists with respect to sexual reproduction. A sufficient body of facts will afterwards be adduced, showing that the segregation or separation of the characters of the two parent-forms by bud- variation, {{as in the case of}} <b>Cytisus</b> adami, is not an unusual though a striking phenomenon. We shall further see that a whole bud may thus revert, or only half, or some smaller segment.|$|E
60|$|The potato affords {{the best}} {{evidence}} {{of the possibility of}} the formation of graft-hybrids, but we must not overlook the account given of the origin of the famous <b>Cytisus</b> adami by M. Adam, who had no conceivable motive for deception, and the exactly parallel account of the origin of the Bizzarria orange, namely by graft-hybridisation. Nor must the cases be undervalued in which different varieties or species of vines, hyacinths and roses, have been grafted together, and have yielded intermediate forms. It is evident that graft-hybrids can be made much more easily with some plants, as the potato, than with others, for instance our common fruit trees; for these latter have been grafted by the million during many centuries, and though the graft is often slightly affected, it is very doubtful whether this may not be accounted for, merely by a more or less free supply of nutriment. Nevertheless, the cases above given seem to me to prove that under certain unknown conditions graft-hybridisation can be effected.|$|E
6000|$|The valley, winding {{through the}} red and green hills, was dull and warm till the cool morning easter, which usually set about eight a.m., began to blow. The effect of {{increasing}} altitude showed itself in the vegetation. We now saw {{for the first time}} the Kidád (Astragalus), with horrid thorns and a flower resembling from afar the gooseberry: it is common on the Hismá and in the South Country. The Kahlá (Echium), a bugloss, a borage-like plant, with viscous leaves and flowers of two colours,--the young light-pink and the old dark-blue,--everywhere beautified the sands, and reminded me of the Istrian hills, where it is plentiful as in the Nile Valley. The Jarad-thorn was not in bloom; and the same was the case with the hyacinth (Dipcadi erythraeum), so abundant in the Hisma', which some of us mistook for a [...] "wild onion." [...] The Zayti (Lavandula) had just donned its pretty azure bloom. There were Reseda, wild indigo, Tribulus (terrestris), the blue Aristida, the pale Stipa, and the Bromus grass, red and yellow. The Ratam (spartium), with delicate white and pink blossoms, was a reminiscence of Tenerife and its glorious crater; whilst a little higher up, the amene <b>Cytisus,</b> flowering with gold, carried our thoughts back to the far past.|$|E
6000|$|After a {{few minutes}} we left the Hárr, which drains the tallest of the inland hillock-ranges, and the red block [...] "Hamrá el-Maysarah;" [...] and we struck {{south-east}} into the Wady Sanawíyyah. It is a vulgar valley with a novelty, the Tamrat Faraj. This cairn of brick-coloured boulders buttressing the right bank has, or is said to have, the Memnonic property of emitting sounds--Yarinn is the Bedawi word. The boomings and bellowings {{are said to be}} loudest at sunrise and sunset. The [...] "hideous hum" [...] of such subterraneous thunderings is alluded to by all travellers in the Dalmatian Island of Melada, and in the Narenta Valley. The marvel has been accounted for by the escape of imprisoned air unequally expanded, but [...] "a veil of mystery hangs over the whole."[EN#18] The valley-sides of dark trap were striped with white veins of heat-altered argil; the sole with black magnetic sand; and patches of the bed were buttercup-yellow with the Handán (dandelion), the <b>Cytisus,</b> and the Zaram (Panicum turgidum) loved by camels. Their jaundiced hue contrasted vividly with the red and mauve blossoms of the boragine El-Kahlá, the blue flowerets of the Lavandula (El-Zayti), and the delicate green of the useless[EN#19] asphodel (El-Borag), which now gave a faint and shadowy aspect of verdure to the slopes. Although the rise was inconsiderable, the importance of the vegetation palpably decreased as we advanced inland.|$|E
60|$|As we {{advanced}} up the Camiño de Chasna, a road only by name, the quintas were {{succeeded by}} brown-thatched huts, single or in clumps. On the left, 3,400 feet above sea-level, stood the Pino del Dornajito ('of the Little Trough'), {{one of the}} few survivors in this once wealthy pine-ground. The magnificent old tree, which was full grown {{in the days of the}} conquest, and which in the seventeenth century was a favourite halting-point, suffered severely from the waterspout of November 7, 1826; but still measured 130 feet long by 29 in girth. The vegetation now changed. We began brushing through the arbutus (callicarpa), the wild olive (Olea excelsa), the Canarian oak, the daphne, the myrtle entwined with indigenous ivy (Hedera canariensis); the <b>cytisus,</b> the bright green hypericum of three species, thyme, gallworts, and arborescent and other ferns in numbers, especially the hare's-foot and the peculiar Asplenium canariense, the Trichomanes canariensis, and the Davallia canariensis; the brezo (Erica aborea and E. scoparia), a heath whose small white bells scented the air; and the luxuriant blackberry, used to fortify the drystone walls. The dew-cloud now began to float upwards from the sea in scarf-shape, only a few hundred feet thick; it had hangings and fringes where it was caught by the rugged hill-flanks; and above us globular masses, white as cotton bales, rolled over one another. As in the drier regions of Africa the hardly risen sun made itself felt.|$|E
60|$|The {{stripes and}} {{segments}} just referred to are not due, {{as far as}} is known, to reversion to characters derived from a cross, but to characters lost by variation. These cases, however, as Naudin (13/22. 'Nouvelles Archives du Museum' tome 1 page 25. Alex. Braun (in his 'Rejuvenescence' Ray Soc. 1853 page 315) apparently holds a similar opinion.) insists in his discussion on disjunction of character, are closely analogous with those given in the eleventh chapter, in which crossed plants {{have been known to}} produce half-and- half or striped flowers and fruit, or distinct kinds of flowers on the same root resembling the two parent-forms. Many piebald animals probably come under this same head. Such cases, as we shall see in the chapter on Crossing, apparently result from certain characters not readily blending together, and, as a consequence of this incapacity for fusion, the offspring either perfectly resemble one of their two parents, or resemble one parent in one part, and the other parent in another part; or whilst young are intermediate in character, but with advancing age revert wholly or by segments to either parent-form, or to both. Thus, young trees of the <b>Cytisus</b> adami are intermediate in foliage and flowers between the two parent-forms; but when older the buds continually revert either partially or wholly to both forms. The cases given in the eleventh chapter on the changes which occurred during growth in crossed plants of Tropaeolum, Cereus, Datura, and Lathyrus are all analogous. As, however, these plants are hybrids of the first generation, and as their buds after a time come to resemble their parents and not their grandparents, these cases do not at first appear to come under the law of reversion in the ordinary sense of the word; nevertheless, as the change is effected through a succession of bud-generations on the same plant, they may be thus included.|$|E
60|$|The {{scattered}} growths {{were composed}} of the broomy Codeso and Retama. The former (Adenocarpus frankenoides), a leguminous plant, showed only dense light-green leaves without flower, and consequently without their heavy, cloying perfume. The woody stem acts in these regions as the doornboom of South Africa, the wild sage of the western prairies, and the shih (absinthium) of the Arabian desert. The Arabic Retama, or Alpine broom (<b>Cytisus</b> fragrans, Lam.; Cyt. nubigenus, Decan.; Spartium nubigenum, Alton and Von Buch), {{is said to be}} peculiar to Tenerife, where it is not found under one vertical mile of height. Some travellers divide it into two species, Spartium monospermum and S. nubigenum. The bush, 9 to 10 feet tall by 7 to 15 inches diameter, is easily distinguished from the Codeso by its denser and deeper green. This pretty rounded growth, with its short brown stem throwing out lateral branches which trail on the ground, flavours meat, and might be naturalised in Europe. From June till August it is covered with a profusion of white blossoms, making Las Canadas a Hymettus, an apiarian heaven. It extends as far as the second cone, but there it shrinks to a foot in height. We did not see the tree growing, but we met a party of Chasna men, [Footnote: A romantic tale is told of the origin of Chasna. In 1496, before the wars ended, one Pedro de Bracamonte, a captain under De Lugo, captured a 'belle sauvage,' who made her escape after a few days. He went about continually repeating, 'Vi la flor del valle' (I saw the valley flower), and died after three months. His soldiers buried him and priests said masses for the soul of this 'hot amorist.'] driving asses like onagers, laden with the gummy wood of the Tea or Tiya pine (P. canariensis). The valuable material, which resists damp and decay for centuries, and which Decandolle declares would grow in Scotland, is rapidly disappearing from the Pinals. The travellers carried cochineal-seed, for which their village is famous, and a hive which might have been Abyssinian. It was a hollow cylinder of palm-bole, closed with board at either end; in July and August it is carried up the mountain, where the bees cannot destroy the grapes. We searched in vain for M. Broussonet's white violet (V. teydensis), [Footnote: Humboldt's five zones of vegetation on the Pike are vines, laurels, pines, broom, and grasses (p. 116). Mr. Addison modifies this scale to vines, laurels, pines and junipers, mountain-brooms and pumice-plains, I should distribute the heights as growing cochineal, potatoes, and cereals, chestnuts, pines, heaths, grasses, and bare rock.] and for the lilac-coloured Viola cheiranthifolia, akin to V. decumbens.|$|E
