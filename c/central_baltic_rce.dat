40|$|Oithona similis is an {{abundant}} but poorly studied cyclopoid copepod in the brackish <b>Central</b> <b>Baltic</b> Sea. We describe the spatio-temporal distribution of O. similis in a <b>Central</b> <b>Baltic</b> deep basin (Bornholm Basin) during {{spring and summer}} 1999. Using vertically resolving sampling in parallel with hydrographic measurements, we found the copepod to dwell in the permanent halocline characteristic of a <b>Central</b> <b>Baltic</b> deep basin. The habitat of O. similis is thus limited from above by low salinity and from below by low oxygen conditions, both characteristic for the area. Horizontally resolving sampling yielded abundance surfaces which were compared by analysis of variance showing similar patterns among sampling dates.

However, knowledge of their distribution and abundance as actively CO 2 -fixing microorganisms in pelagic redoxclines is still deficient. We determined the contribution of Epsilonproteobacteria to dark CO 2 fixation in the sulfidic areas of <b>central</b> <b>Baltic</b> Sea and Black Sea redoxclines by combining catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization with microautoradiography using [14 C]bicarbonate and compared it to the total prokaryotic chemoautotrophic activity. In absolute numbers, up to 3 × 105 14 CO 2 -fixing prokaryotic cells ml− 1 were enumerated in the redoxcline of the <b>central</b> <b>Baltic</b> Sea and up to 9 × 104 14 CO 2 -fixing cells ml− 1 were enumerated in the Black Sea redoxcline, corresponding to 29 % and 12 %, respectively, of total cell abundance. 14 CO 2 -incorporating cells belonged exclusively to the domain Bacteria.

For the Baltic Sea, the Sulfurimonas subgroup GD 17, previously assumed to be involved in autotrophic denitrification, was the most dominant CO 2 -fixing group. In conclusion, Epsilonproteobacteria were found to be mainly responsible for chemoautotrophic activity in the dark CO 2 fixation maxima of the Black Sea and <b>central</b> <b>Baltic</b> Sea redoxclines.

40|$|AbstractHerring (Clupea harengus) is {{a capital}} breeder that stores energy {{reserves}} in muscle tissue. Individual potential fecundity {{relies on the}} size and weight of female fish. Poor condition during the maturation process {{can lead to a}} heavy down-regulation of fecundity through atresia and, in the extreme, cause skipped spawning. Herring in the <b>Central</b> <b>Baltic</b> Sea exist in a variable environment where food availability fluctuates substantially. Compared to other herring populations their condition is generally poor. In the present study, the oocyte dynamics and fecundity in relation to the condition of <b>Central</b> <b>Baltic</b> herring was investigated. A modern stereological method, the physical fractionator, was used to quantify the number of oocytes in previtellogenic (PG), cortical alveoli (CA) as well as successive vitellogenic (VT 1 and VT 2) stages in <b>central</b> <b>Baltic</b> herring during ovarian maturation. The potential fecundity, i. e. the number of VT 2 oocytes, was low compared to other Atlantic stocks but the relative potential fecundity was higher. The latter decreased by 71 % when comparing early-maturing individuals with CA oocytes and late-maturing individuals with VT 2 oocytes, suggesting a substantial down-regulation of fecundity. Although determined as spring spawners by otolith hatch type, 15 % of the randomly sampled females were characterized by oocytes in CA stage in the prespawning period, indicating skipped spawning. The condition of these females was poor, which might have resulted in skipped spawning. Ovary weight was a good predictor of potential fecundity within maturing stages of females. Combined with estimates of skipped spawning, this ovary weight could be used to estimate egg production thereby improving <b>Central</b> <b>Baltic</b> herring stock-recruitment models...|$|R

For this purpose, the absolute abundance of these microfossils were recorded. Quantitative measurements of morphological change of the dinoflagellate Operculodinium centrocarpum, which indicate salinity changes, were performed. The cores from the <b>Central</b> <b>Baltic</b> Sea are correlated ecostratigraphically.

We present laboratory feeding rate experiments along with video recordings, in situ reproduction rates and distribution data to investigate the direct and indirect effect on the Baltic cod population. Feeding rates on cod larvae were low and negligible for eggs under the hydrographic conditions characteristic for the spawning grounds. Further, Mnemiopsis passively selected against cod eggs. Application of our clearance rates to in situ abundances confirmed that Mnemiopsis has a negligible direct predation impact on cod offspring. Further, due to drastically reduced reproduction rates at low salinities, occurrence of Mnemiopsis in the <b>central</b> <b>Baltic</b> appears {{to be dependent on}} advection, and is unlikely to reach large population sizes.

Large interannual fluctuations in the standing stock of P. elongatus have been attributed to significant changes in the hydrographic environment over the last two decades. In particular, the decreasing salinity in the Baltic deep basins, a result of a change in atmospheric forcing leading to an increase in rainfall since the 1980 s and of a lack of pulses of saline water intrusions from the North Sea, was found to affect reproduction and maturation of the copepod. In parallel, dramatic changes in the weight-at-age of herring, {{one of the most important}} commercial fishes of the Baltic Sea, have been observed since the late 1980 s.

The September 1999 was the warmest since 1946. The mild winter led to sea surface temperatures in the Baltic Sea that were about 1 K above the long-term mean during winter and early spring. This resulted in relatively warm water of 3 - 4 C being trapped in the summer intermediate water layer of the <b>central</b> <b>Baltic</b> Sea. The surface temperatures in the summer reached positive anomalies up to 4 K in the 20 m upper layer due to the warm summer. The deep water temperatures of the <b>central</b> <b>Baltic</b> Sea were still anomalously high due to the inflow of warm water in 1997, 0. 2 - 1. 7 K above the mean for the period 1950 - 1998. The weather conditions in winter 1998 / 1999 {{gave rise to a}} low inflow activity across the sills into the Baltic with only small inflows. Inflows in October and late December 1998 led only to the aeration of the Bornholm Basin deep water in spring 1999. From May ownwards hydrogen sulphide was measured in the Bornholm Basin up to the end of November when other small inflows led again to oxic conditions. A major inflow event did not occur. In the eastern Gotland Basin, the anoxic water covered the layer between bottom and about 130 m depth all year round.

40|$|How {{multiple}} stressors influence fish stock dynamics is {{a crucial}} question in ecology in general and in fisheries science in particular. Using time-series covering a 30 yr period, we show that the body growth of the <b>central</b> <b>Baltic</b> Sea herring Clupea harengus, {{both in terms of}} condition and weight-at-age (WAA), has shifted from being mainly driven by hydro-climatic forces to an inter-specific density-dependent control. The shift in the mechanisms of regulation of herring growth is triggered by the abundance of sprat, the main food competitor for herring. Abundances of sprat above the threshold of ~ 18 × 1010 ind. decouple herring growth from hydro-climatic factors (i. e. salinity), and become the main driver of herring growth variations. At high sprat densities, herring growth is considerably lower than at low sprat levels, regardless of the salinity conditions, indicative of hysteresis in the response of herring growth to salinity changes. The threshold dynamic accurately explains the changes in herring growth during the past 3 decades and in turn contributes to elucidate the parallel drastic drop in herring spawning stock biomass. Studying the interplay between different stressors can provide fundamental information for the management of exploited resources. The management of the <b>central</b> <b>Baltic</b> herring stock should be adaptive and take into consideration the dual response of herring growth to hydro-climatic forces and food-web structure for a sound ecosystem approach to fisheries...|$|R
40|$|The {{comb jelly}} Mertensia ovum, widely {{distributed}} in Arctic regions, {{has recently been}} discovered in the northern Baltic Sea. We show that M. ovum also exists in the <b>central</b> <b>Baltic</b> but that the population consists solely of small-sized larvae (less than 1. 6 mm). Despite the absence of adults, eggs were abundant. Experiments revealed that the larvae were reproductively active. Egg production and anticipated mortality rates suggest a self-sustaining population. This is the first account of a ctenophore population entirely recruiting through larval reproduction (paedogenesis). We hypothesize that early reproduction is favoured over growth to compensate for high predation pressure...|$|R
