5000|$|Machig Labdrön's Chöd, {{also known}} as Mahamudra Chöd, has been {{widespread}} in Tibet since Machig's lifetime. It is also called [...] "The Beggars' Offering" [...] or [...] "The Cutting-Off-Ritual." [...] Chöd is a visionary Buddhist practice of <b>cutting</b> <b>attachment</b> to one’s corporeal form (in terms of the dualistic proclivity to relate to one's corporeal form as a reference-point that proves one's existence). This means that a practitioner offers the mandala of their own body in a ganachakra rite. The practitioner works entirely with their own mind, visualizing the offering, and—by practicing in lonely and dreaded places, like cemeteries—works to overcome all fear. This is also why Chöd was often used to overcome sickness in order to heal oneself and others. In some lineages of the Chöd practice, chodpas and chodmas (practitioners of Chöd) use a ritual bell, a specialized Chöd drum called a damaru, and a human thigh-bone trumpet (often obtained from the charnel ground of sky burials).|$|E
40|$|Generally, {{the choice}} of <b>cutting</b> <b>attachment</b> used in brush cutters for brushwoods and grasses depends {{on the type of}} work, on one hand, {{and the size of the}} engine, on the other. However, at the same time, the use of {{individually}} chosen cutting elements entails a certain risk of vibration resulting from their varying design and size, which has a big impact on comfort and working time, but most importantly on operator health...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} homeowners {{that would like}} to {{maintain}} the trees around their homes but cannot do so. The drive of this project was to develop a 0 g mechanism which would provide a senior citizen or an individual with limited upper body strength, with the ability to cut through branches that would otherwise pose challenging. The design would allow the end user to cut a branch by simply pulling a trigger. A branch <b>cutting</b> <b>attachment</b> was designed to attach to the front of a DeWALT cordless impact gun. This attachment will convert the rotational torque and motion from the impact gun into a shearing motion which can be utilized by a set of cutting blades to cut through the branches. This conversion came through a worm gear set that simultaneously changes the rotational direction of motion and increases the output torque of the impact gun through the gear set. The cutter was constructed from lightweight aluminum to keep the weight down as it is a hand held tool and was also designed to be easily attached and detached from the impact gun for ease of use. The design incorporated off the shelf blades so that in the event a blade was damaged during use a new blade was easy to obtain. Through testing {{it was found that the}} <b>cutting</b> <b>attachment</b> performed well on a variety of tree branch types and sizes up to 1 - 1 / 8 ”. It was also found that the attachment was easy to use by all user types. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{cultivation}} of Gracilaria domingensis in a mussel farming urbanized area in Santa Catarina, Brazil. Relative growth rate was the parameter {{used to evaluate the}} <b>cuttings</b> <b>attachment</b> methods on the cultivation rope, cuttings density, cultivation period and cystocarpic versus unfertile thalli performance. The cultivation was feasible only when protected by net cages due to herbivory. The tie-tie attachment method presented the best results. No differences were observed when comparing the cuttings densities and reproductive phase. Future studies should evaluate the cost-effectiveness of producing the species in net cages and its potential as biofilter...|$|R

50|$|A drill {{is a tool}} {{fitted with}} a <b>cutting</b> tool <b>attachment</b> or driving tool attachment, usually a drill bit or driver bit, used for boring holes in various {{materials}} or fastening various materials together. The attachment is gripped by a chuck {{at one end of}} the drill and rotated while pressed against the target material. The tip, and sometimes edges, of the cutting tool does the work of cutting into the target material. This may be slicing off thin shavings (twist drills or auger bits), grinding off small particles (oil drilling), crushing and removing pieces of the workpiece (SDS masonry drill), countersinking, counterboring, or other operations.|$|R
40|$|While monastic {{identity}} and ascetic {{practices such as}} vipassanā meditation have historically been the preserve of monks, requiring full ordination and celibacy, in contemporary Thailand ‘monastic’ and ‘lay’ are not fixed or mutually exclusive categories: temporary ordination for {{short periods of time}} has always been available to Thai men; vipassanā has been propagated to the laity since the 1950 s; large numbers of laity now enter monasteries as mediation students for short periods and accept monastic precepts for the duration of their retreat; and finally, the subsequent monasticization of popular Buddhism is enabling Thai Buddhist nuns (mae chee), though outside the ordained monastic community (sangha), to define themselves in ways which are, critically, religious, ascetic and  associated with prestige. At the same time, it is providing a vehicle for the actualization of renunciation through the monastic duty to teach and embody the principles of meditation. Monastic {{identity and}} practice remain distinct from that of the laity even as lay practice becomes increasingly monasticized. I identify the paradox of will and spontaneity in religious attainment as highlighting the appropriateness of vipassanā  practice in the Buddhist ethical project of <b>cutting</b> <b>attachment</b> to ones self. The morality of monastics presents paradox as a process of self-aware reflection on the one hand and, on the other, absence of self in the performance of one’s moral duty to the laity. For meditation practitioners it is through such self-willed practice that the ethical ideals of non-self (anatta) and spiritual attainment may be actualized. Through the performance of mindfulness within a community of practice, monastics cultivate an ascetic interiority, creating the cognitive space in which spiritual development may be actualized. In this context the ethical ideals of monasticism are actualized through the practice of meditation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

5000|$|Chöd {{developed}} {{outside the}} monastic system. It was subsequently {{adopted by the}} monastic lineages. As an internalization of an outer ritual, Chöd involves a form of self-sacrifice: the practitioner visualizes their own body as the offering at a ganachakra. The purpose of the practice is to engender a sense of victory and fearlessness. These two qualities are represented iconographically by the victory banner and the ritual knife. The banner symbolizes overcoming obstacles and the knife symbolizes cutting through the ego. The practitioner may cultivate imaginary fearful or painful situations since they help the practitioner's work of <b>cutting</b> through <b>attachment</b> to the self. Machig Labdrön said, [...] "To consider adversity as a friend is the instruction of Chöd".|$|R

Children become increasingly aware of their mortality as they bump their heads and fall to the ground. They come to fear their mortality and then palliate this fear by finding ways to deny it altogether. In this sense, the Aghora sādhanā is a process of unlearning deeply internalized cultural models. When this sādhanā takes the form of charnel ground sādhanā, the Aghori faces death as a very young child, simultaneously meditating on the totality of life at its two extremes. This ideal example serves as a prototype for other Aghor practices, both left and right, in ritual and in daily life." ...|$|R

30|$|In the film, Kibong was {{introduced}} as a discontented {{young man who}} comes to the mountain hermitage to search for his true self. His Confucian virtue as a {{head of the household}} seems to be disharmonized with his own possibilities of self-realization. In his case, departure is detachment from his blind elderly mother and underage sister. He suffers from the family pressures of taking care of his blind mother. He has a strong desire to escape from reality and to chase after personal freedom. Therefore, he chooses to leave the world and seek after enlightenment. By doing so, he has to empty his inner world and break the ties with his family. From a Confucian point of view, he deserves criticism for turning away from his filial responsibility. The irony is that, when he becomes a monk, he is sent to a remote mountain {{to take care of a}} sick Seon Master, Hyegok, and a baby orphan brother, Haejin. His departure from his family caused him to have another set of relationships. That is to say, there will be no way one can be completely detached from human relationships, but we all probably have to live an endless karma of attachment and detachment through continual practices of emptying and filling. Although Kibong ordains with the hope that he can achieve liberation and enlightenment by <b>cutting</b> off all <b>attachments</b> to his previous life, he cannot avoid this karmic facticity of relationships.|$|R
30|$|Although we can {{successfully}} remove leads with mechanical dilator sheath extraction systems, procedure has serious life threatening complications. The Evolution {{is a big}} bulky device {{and has to be}} used by at least two experienced operators one holding the lead and stylet complex and other one <b>cutting</b> fibrotic <b>attachments</b> and advancing the dilator sheath. If their manipulations are not optimally coordinated the lead’s integrity can be easily damaged and heart and great vessels may be injured during the procedure. Major complications with percutaneous lead extraction procedures are cardiac rupture (1 – 4  %), emergency cardiac surgery requirement (1 – 2  %) and death (0.4 – 0.8  %) (Henrikson and Brinker 2008). In our experience we had 4.8  % major and 12.2  % minor complication rates. These rates may be due to our relatively early experience, older age of patients and long implantation duration in our study. Compared to our preliminary results (Kocabas et al. 2015) clinical and procedural success rates are similar but, our minor complication rates declined and less snare use is needed with more experience with the extraction system. Learning curve mostly occurs during first 10 – 20 cases and when compared with our previous report need for snares 20  % and other minor complications 25  % decreased to 12.2  %. Only one additional case of snaring was required in our second half of experience and other minor complications which we reported in preliminary results did not occur. Snaring was needed mostly in patients who have passive fixation electrodes and previously damaged leads. However there was one case of mortality in our series. That patient suffered sudden cardiac arrest with electromechanical dissociation without any pericardial or pleural effusion, arrythmia or profound hypotension in intensive care unit 4  h after successful procedure. He did not respond to iv fluids vasopressors and cardiopulmoner resuscitation and expired before being taken into the cardiovascular surgery room. Autopsy was not performed but tear and late rupture of great vessels is suspected because two mechanical dilator sheaths (11 F and 13 F) were used in this patient to complete the extraction procedure. Experience of the operator is important in preventing complications with these extraction systems; (Smith and Love 2008) and procedure must be performed at high volume cardiovascular centers with emergency cardiovascular surgery backup.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of the main process {{parameters}} involved in CO 2 laser cutting of 1. 5 -mm twinning-induced plasticity steel sheets have been investigated by means of experimental tests. The quality of the cut edges of the sheets was evaluated by analyzing the kerf width, kerf deviation, roughness of the cut surfaces, and dross attachment. The process parameters used were the laser power, cutting speed, oxygen pressure, and pulse frequency of the CO 2 laser beam. The optimal settings of the process parameters were predicted using the Taguchi parameter design approach with an L 27 (3 (13)) orthogonal array and calculating the average effect of both the laser parameters and the signal-to-noise ratios. Analysis of variance was performed to evaluate the statistical significance and the contribution of the laser process parameters to the examined kerf features and roughness. On the basis of the Taguchi approach, the predicted optimal settings of the process parameters were verified through confirmation tests. The results show that the selected process parameters, as well as their interactions, can have a remarkable effect on the cutting quality of twinning-induced plasticity steel sheets. The laser power is the main process parameter that affects the kerf width on both sheet sides, while the pulse frequency and its interaction with the laser power are the main factors that influence the kerf deviation, followed by the cutting speed. The roughness of the cut surfaces is mainly affected by the oxygen pressure and the interaction between laser power and <b>cutting</b> speed. Dross <b>attachment</b> was primarily observed in the specimens cut with high laser power and low cutting spee...|$|R
40|$|Local Name: Aphrodisias, Northeast NecropolisLocal Information: Old Geyre Cemetery in use {{at least}} up to 2003 Latitude: 37. 42. 41. 6 Longitude: 28. 43. 50. 2 Elevation: 532 mAxis: South (vault); east (doorway) Dimensions: W: 1. 55 m, D: 2. 25 mDescription: Two {{independent}} simple vaulted tombs (a: "Bishop's Tomb", b: "trapezoidal tomb"). Both well preserved; both entirely cleared by Museum. The tombs open onto a shared quadrilateral forecourt (approximately 1. 70 m n-s {{by up to}} 1. 55 m e-w). They have no walls in common. The western (118 a) should predate the eastern (118 b) since the west wall of the latter blocks {{the end of the}} inscription on the lintel of the former; they may be roughly contemporary, however. The full thickness of two walls of Tomb 118 a is known; the southern is 0. 64 m thick, and the western is 0. 72 m thick. No superstructure of either tomb is visible. The western tomb (D 118 a) is a regular vaulted chamber, 2. 25 m N-S by 1. 55 m E-W. Although the vault is oriented N-S, entrance is through {{the southern end of the}} eastern wall (H: 1. 20 m, W: 0. 8 m). The threshold is missing, but the lintel, though broken, is preserved in place and inscribed "Theopropius, bishop. He lives. " with flanking chi-rho monograms (ALA 166). A pivot is preserved on the north end (Diam: 0. 09 m, D: 0. 06 m); from the outside, the door swung inward and toward right. The masonry of the walls is quite irregular, and many of the thick mortar beds are scored. Some sections are in coursed petit appareil, but other areas contain re-used blocks; these include two fragments of a sarcophagus lid at the spring point of the vault in the northwest corner, and four scattered petit appareil blocks with clamp <b>cuttings</b> for the <b>attachment</b> of revetment. A square niche (H: 0. 52 m, W: 0. 45 m) is centered in the upper part of the north wall. The heavily mortared vault is constructed entirely of long split marble blocks (L: 0. 40 - 0. 88 m, H: 0. 27 - 0. 38 m, W: 0. 06 - 0. 11 m); the structure is most clearly visible at the southern end where it is broken away. Plaster is preserved on some sections of the walls, especially along the eastern wall, across most of the vault, and within the area of the cists. The plaster contains many long narrow cavities, perhaps from decayed straw. ** The floor of the doorway is 2. 05 m below the crest of the vault. Below this level are two layers of cists; the upper continues 0. 70 m below the floor level, and the lower reaches 1. 27 below the floor. A shallow indentation (H: 0. 09 - 0. 10 m, D: 0. 07 - 0. 10 m) cut into the blocks of the north wall marks the original floor level and the upper level of the cists, and is likely served to support the cover slabs. The level of the lower cists is marked in the north and south walls by a shallow shelf that projects 0. 12 - 0. 16 m from the plane of the wall. Two cross walls divide the lowest area into three cists (southern: L: 1. 73 m, W: 0. 56 m; middle: L: 1. 68 m, W: 0. 45 m; northern: L: 2. 00 m, W: 0. 44 m). The wall between the southern two is built of mortared rubble (W: 0. 28 - 0. 31 m), while the wall between the northern (W max: 0. 23 m) is made up in great part of re-used blocks, including a vertically split Corinthian capital (H orig: 0. 64 m). The northern cist is longer than the others since it extends eastward under the eastern wall of the tomb. Several fragments of bone are seen in the bottom of the northern cist...|$|R
