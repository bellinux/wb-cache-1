DESIGN [...] Retrospective {{review of the}} last six years' issues of Ringing World, advertisement in Ringing World, and a postal questionnaire sent to 20 active ringing towers. SUBJECTS [...] Regular bell ringers. RESULTS [...] Seventy nine injuries were identified both from review and by advertisement in Ringing World. The incidence of injury among 221 ringers identified by postal questionnaire was 1. 8 % a year. CONCLUSION [...] Although sonerous, bell ringing can be dangerous and occasionally even fatal. Doctors {{should be aware of the}} dangers to which <b>campanologists</b> expose themselves...|$|R

50|$|The {{town has}} two notable rings of bells hung for change ringing. One is at St. Christopher's (Warden Hill), the lightest ring of church bells in the world.

The other is a ring of 12 bells dating mainly from the 19th century hung in St. Mary's Church. These were the venue in 2008 for the eliminators of the National 12 Bell Striking contest, in which teams of <b>campanologists</b> from around the world compete to win the Taylor Trophy. The towers in the locality of Cheltenham belong to the Cheltenham branch of the Gloucester & Bristol Diocesan Association of Church Bell Ringers.|$|R
50|$|Madresfield {{is part of}} a Church of England parish which {{includes}} the neighbouring village of Guarlford. There is a parish church in the village (dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin). There have been three churches, the first a small chapel that was mainly used by the Beauchamps. A second church, built on marshy ground to the designs of Augustus Pugin, was demolished after only twelve years after becoming unsafe. The present church was built on land donated by the Earl Beauchamp and re-used many items from the earlier church. The church, dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, has a refurbished peal of bells which are on the visiting circuit of regional <b>campanologists.</b> The bells were rehung in December 2005 following recasting of 1 and 2 from the scrap metal of the old 4th and tenor and retuning the other bells., The village also has a primary school.|$|R
5000|$|Yarkhill Church is {{important}} to <b>campanologists</b> as the [...] "Father of Change Ringing" [...] Fabian Stedman {{was born in the}} village and baptised at St John's church on 7 December 1640. Fabian's father Francis Stedman was Rector of Yarkhill from 1625-1671. Francis's time as Rector saw the installation of the current ring of four bells seen today. In October 2012 the Church finally completed the project to install 8 new bells dedicated to the legacy of Fabian Stedman. In fact the new tenor bell of the ring of eight was inscribed [...] "Given by the Bell Restoration Fund who named me Fabian Stedman 1640-1713". The old four bells have been preserved as they hang in the old 17th century bell frame. It is still hoped when funds become available that the old bells will be fitted with chiming apperatur so they can be heard. The new bells have been rung regularly on practice nights and for Sunday service. Many visitors have been given permission to ring the bells for pure enjoyment, and Stedman Triples is a regular method to be heard ringing out from the tower.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1950s, {{he played}} the time-traveller (also known as [...] "the voice") in the British sci-fi radio series Journey Into Space. Guyler then took on the role in the title {{character}} of a Scotland Yard detective in the Light Programme series Inspector Scott Investigates, created by John P. Wynn, that ran from 1957 to 1963.
