50|$|Note that check {{words are}} not subject to bit stuffing, and may be all-zero or all-one. Thus, it is not {{possible}} to detect erasure of a <b>check</b> <b>word.</b>|$|E
50|$|Additionally, if {{the total}} number of data bits {{available}} in the symbol is not a multiple of the codeword size, the data string is prefixed with an appropriate number of 0 bits to occupy the extra space. These bits are not included in the <b>check</b> <b>word</b> computation.|$|E
50|$|Both {{the mode}} word, and the data, must have <b>check</b> <b>words</b> {{appended}} {{to fill out}} the available space. This is computed by appending K <b>check</b> <b>words</b> such that the entire message is a multiple of the Reed-Solomon polynomial (x−2)(x−4)...(x−2K).|$|R

50|$|The padded main message {{begins at}} the outer top-left of the entire symbol, and spirals around it {{counterclockwise}} in a 2-bit thick layer, ending directly above the top-left corner of the core. This places the bit-stuffed data words, for which erasures can be detected, in the outermost layers of the symbol, which is most prone to erasures. The check words are stored closer to the core. The last <b>check</b> <b>word</b> ends just above the top left corner of the bull's eye.|$|E
5000|$|In some cases, {{the total}} {{capacity}} of the matrix does not divide evenly by full code words. In such cases the main message is padded with 0 bits in the beginning. These bits {{are not included in}} the <b>check</b> <b>word</b> calculation and should be skipped during decoding. The total matrix capacity for a full symbol can be calculated as (112+16*L)*L for a full Aztec code and (88+16*L)*L for a compact Aztec code, where L is the symbol size in layers. [...] As an example, the total matrix capacity of a compact Aztec code with 1 layer is 104 bits. Since code words are six bits, this gives 17 code words and two extra bits. Two zero bits are prepended to the message as padding and must be skipped during decoding.|$|E
50|$|The mode word {{is broken}} into 2 or 4 4-bit codewords in GF(16), and 5 or 6 Reed-Solomon <b>check</b> <b>words</b> are appended, making a 28- or 40-bit mode message, which is {{wrapped in a}} 1-pixel layer around the core.|$|R

While the gay images did not affect homophobia, they elicited strong negative emotional responses, particularly the erotic images, and the responses were strongly correlated with levels of homophobia.

40|$|Abstract: Mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) {{is a kind}} of {{wireless}} ad-hoc network. It is a self-configuring network of mobile nodes connected by wireless links, without the aid of any fixed infrastructure or centralized administration. Nodes within their wireless transmitter ranges can communicate with each other directly, while nodes outside the range rely on other nodes to relay messages resulting in a multi-hop scenario. As the low transmission power of each node limits its communication range, the nodes must assist and trust each other before getting involved into a real communication. However, this implied trust relationship can be threatened by malicious nodes. So far the majority of research work has been done to achieve a secure routing infrastructure, assuming the existence of an efficient node authentication mechanism which in turn is part of a key management scheme. This paper will analyze previous work and then present a new node authentication mechanism which is fully distributed and has the ability to self-organize with out the requirement of any online trusted third party.
