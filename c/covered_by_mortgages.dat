50|$|In real estate, {{foreclosure}} is {{the termination}} of the equity of redemption of a mortgagor or the grantee in the property <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> the <b>mortgage.</b> Depending {{on the type of}} foreclosure proceeding, the sale may be administered by the courts (judicial foreclosure) or by an appointed trustee (statutory foreclosure). Proceeds from the sale are used to satisfy the claims of the mortgagee primarily, with any excess going to the mortgagor. Anyone may bid on properties sold at a foreclosure sale. As a practical matter, however, most properties are acquired by the lender, often for the amount owed on the foreclosed loan.|$|R
50|$|The {{suit was}} {{apparently}} decided in Fust's favour, November 6, 1455, in the refectory of the Barefooted Friars of Mainz, when Fust swore {{that he himself}} had borrowed 1550 guilders and given them to Gutenberg. There {{is no evidence that}} Fust, as is usually supposed, removed the portion of the printing materials <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> his <b>mortgage</b> to his own house, and carried on printing there with the aid of Peter Schöffer of Gernsheim (who is known to have been a scriptor at Paris in 1449), who in about 1455 married Fust's only daughter Christina. Their first publication was the Psalter, August 14, 1457, a folio of 350 pages, the first printed book with a complete date, and remarkable for the beauty of the large initials printed each in two colours, red and blue, from types made in two pieces. New editions of the Psalter were with the same type in 1459 (August 29), 1490, 1502 (Schöffer's last publication) and 1516.|$|R

Such proceedings were had - the Georgia corporations appearing and making defense - that on May 1, 1877, a final decree was entered by which it was, among other things, adjudged that [...] "the unsecured creditors of the Montgomery and West Point Railroad Company, to which class complainants belong, have a lien" [...] upon the property transferred by it to the Western Railroad Company; that such lien was subordinate to those for the bonds issued under the several <b>mortgages</b> executed <b>by</b> the Montgomery and West Point Railroad Company that were outstanding and unpaid, but superior to that of the <b>mortgage</b> executed <b>by</b> the Western Railroad Company after its said purchase, so far as the property of the Montgomery and West Point Railroad Company was <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> that <b>mortgage,</b> and that the property of all kinds, belonging to the latter company, be sold to satisfy its debts according to priority.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the interactions}} between household wealth, mortgage decisions and savings in a single empirical framework and identifies an important role for a "down-payment channel" in the euro area. Contrary to the traditional housing wealth channel, the "down-payment channel" posits a positive relation between household savings and house prices: a rise in house prices forces credit-constrained households who wish to acquire a house to accumulate more savings in order to cover a higher down-payment (i. e. {{the share of the}} housing acquisition value that is not <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> a <b>mortgage).</b> The overall effect of a rise in house prices on private consumption {{can be seen as the}} result of two offsetting forces: a rise in house prices tends to push up consumption via the traditional housing wealth channel but it also tends to depress the consumption of credit-constrained households who wish to acquire a house via the down-payment channel. Estimates based on a structural VEC model for the euro area suggest that the down-payment effect tends to dominate in the medium term, translating into an overall negative impact of higher house prices on consumption in the euro area. ...|$|R

Furthermore, that the subprime crisis will drag on without a solution such as bankruptcy reform or legislated debt reduction...|$|R

In the Boston NECTA during the 2000 - 2002 period, 70 % of home-purchase lending was done by out-of-state banks or <b>by</b> <b>mortgage</b> companies not affiliated with Massachusetts banks. These lenders, not <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> CRA, perform significantly worse than covered lenders in lending to borrowers and neighborhoods of color. Pending Massachusetts legislation would bring the state’s CRA into line with the transformed nature of the <b>mortgage</b> lending industry <b>by</b> imposing CRA-type obligations and evaluations on all types of mortgage lenders. This could make a significant contribution to reducing the current racial/ethnic disparities in mortgage lending that are documented in this paper. Also available at [URL]...|$|R
