5|$|The US {{state of}} Oregon uses {{magnesium}} chloride, a relatively cheap chemical similar in snow-melting effects to sodium chloride, but less reactive, while New Zealand uses <b>calcium</b> <b>magnesium</b> acetate, which avoids the environmentally harmful chloride ion altogether. Urea is sometimes used to grit suspension bridges, {{as it does}} not corrode iron or steel at all, but urea is less effective than salt, and can cost up to 7 times more weight-for-weight.|$|E
5|$|Annual world {{production}} of yttrium oxide had reached 600tonnes by 2001; by 2014 it had increased to 7,000 tons. Global reserves of yttrium oxide were estimated in 2014 {{to be more}} than 500,000 tons. The leading countries for these reserves included Australia, Brazil, China, India, and the United States. Only a few tonnes of yttrium metal are produced each year by reducing yttrium fluoride to a metal sponge with <b>calcium</b> <b>magnesium</b> alloy. The temperature of an arc furnace of greater than 1,600°C is sufficient to melt the yttrium.|$|E
5|$|Fiberglass is a fiber {{reinforced}} polymer made {{of plastic}} reinforced by glass fibers, commonly woven into a mat. The glass fibers used in the material are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use. These glasses all contain silica or silicate, with varying amounts of oxides of <b>calcium,</b> <b>magnesium,</b> and sometimes boron. The boron is present as borosilicate, borax, or boron oxide, and is added to increase {{the strength of the}} glass, or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of silica, which is too high to be easily worked in its pure form to make glass fibers.|$|E

30|$|The {{concentration}} of <b>calcium</b> and <b>magnesium</b> ranges from 30 to 200  mg/l and 1.2 to 164  mg/l, respectively. The <b>calcium</b> and <b>magnesium</b> ions {{present in the}} groundwater are possibly derived from leaching of calcium and magnesium-bearing rock-forming silicates, limestone, dolomite, gypsum and anhydrides. The majority of groundwater shows {{concentration of}} <b>calcium</b> and <b>magnesium</b> above the WHO (2011) suggested maximum permissible limit.|$|R
5|$|The {{abundant}} inorganic elements act as ionic electrolytes. The {{most important}} ions are sodium, potassium, <b>calcium,</b> <b>magnesium,</b> chloride, phosphate and the organic ion bicarbonate. The maintenance of precise ion gradients across cell membranes maintains osmotic pressure and pH. Ions are also critical for nerve and muscle function, as action potentials in these tissues {{are produced by}} the exchange of electrolytes between the extracellular fluid and the cell's fluid, the cytosol. Electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins in the cell membrane called ion channels. For example, muscle contraction depends upon the movement of calcium, sodium and potassium through ion channels in the cell membrane and T-tubules.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{the total}} {{reserves}} of salt in the mines range from 82 million tons to 600 million tons. In raw form it contains negligible amounts of <b>Calcium,</b> <b>Magnesium,</b> Potassium, Sulphates and moisture, with Iron, Zinc, Copper, Manganese, Chromium and Lead as trace elements. Salt from Khewra, also known as Himalayan salt, is red, pink, off-white or transparent. In {{the early years of}} British rule, the Khewra mine produced about 28,000 to 30,000 tons per annum; it increased to about 187,400 tons per annum for the five fiscal years ending 1946–7 and to 136,824 tons for the two years ending 1949–50 with the systematic working introduced by Dr H. Warth. The mine's output was reported in 2003 to be 385,000 tons of salt per annum, which amounts to almost half of Pakistan's total production of rock salt. At that rate of output, the tunnel would be expected to last for another 350 years.|$|E
5|$|Locusts yield {{about five}} times more edible protein per unit of fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of {{greenhouse}} gases in the process. The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult locust, 14–18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is however low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. A serving of 100 g of desert locust provides 11.5 g of fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286mg of cholesterol. Among the fatty acids, palmitoleic, oleic and linolenic acids {{were found to be}} the most abundant.

5|$|Like humans, {{but unlike}} most other mammals, guinea pigs cannot {{synthesize}} their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy. Guinea pigs require about 10mg of vitamin C daily (20mg if pregnant), {{which can be}} obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements. Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of <b>calcium,</b> <b>magnesium,</b> phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary. Imbalanced diets {{have been associated with}} muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems. Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity. They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types. A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present. Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely , lest their teeth become too large for their mouths, a common problem in rodents. Guinea pigs also chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} was initiated {{to assess the}} following objectives: (1) to measure the total <b>calcium</b> and <b>magnesium</b> content in agricultural soil and sewage sludge from the Mediterranean coastal area of Motril (southeastern Spain); (2) to determine the pH values of indicated samples in order to evaluate first their influence on <b>calcium</b> and <b>magnesium</b> content, and second on levels of these minerals in the main crop (sugar cane: Saccharum officinarum) grown in the area; (3) to study the influence of industrial activities, first on <b>calcium</b> and <b>magnesium</b> cantents and pH values in agricultural soil, and second on <b>calcium</b> and <b>magnesium</b> concentrations present in sugar cane samples; (4) to check if the <b>calcium</b> and <b>magnesium</b> levels existing in agricultural soil exert any influence on corresponding element uptake by sugar cane plants. Calcium levels found in agricultural soil were significantly higher (p < 0. 05) than those found in sewage sludge. Significant linear relationships between <b>calcium</b> and <b>magnesium</b> concentrations in agricultural soil and sewage sludge (p < 0. 005) were found. Calcium concentrations found in soil from the industrialized area (39. 2 ± 7. 2 mg g − 1) {{were significantly higher than}} those corresponding to the non-industrialized area (31. 0 ± 6. 6 mg g − 1). The pH values determined in agricultural soil were significantly influenced by industrial activity (p < 0. 05). The industrial activity and pH values measured in agricultural soil did not statistically influence either <b>calcium</b> or <b>magnesium</b> levels in the sugar cane plants. <b>Calcium</b> and <b>magnesium</b> concentrations existing in agricultural soil did not significantly influence the element uptake by sugar cane plants...|$|R
40|$|Diabetes is {{associated}} with renal <b>calcium</b> and <b>magnesium</b> wasting, but the molecular mechanisms of these defects are unknown. We measured renal <b>calcium</b> and <b>magnesium</b> handling and investigated the effects of diabetes on <b>calcium</b> and <b>magnesium</b> transporters in the thick ascending limb and distal convoluted tubule in streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic rats. Rats were killed 2 weeks after inducing diabetes, gene expression of <b>calcium</b> and <b>magnesium</b> transporters in the kidney was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the abundance of protein was assessed by immunoblotting. Our results showed that diabetic rats had {{significant increase in the}} fractional excretion for <b>calcium</b> and <b>magnesium</b> (both P< 0. 01), but not for sodium. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed significant increases in messenger RNA abundance of transient potential receptor (TRP) V 5 (223 ± 10 %), TRPV 6 (177 ± 9 %), calbindin-D 28 k (231 ± 8 %), and TRPM 6 (165 ± 8 %) in diabetic rats. Sodium chloride cotransporter was also increased (207 ± 10 %). No change was found in paracellin- 1 (cortex: 108 ± 8 %; medulla: 110 ± 10 %). Immunofluorescent studies of renal sections showed significant increase in calbindin-D 28 k (238 ± 10 %) and TRPV 5 (211 ± 10 %), but no changes in paracellin- 1 in Western blotting (cortex: 110 ± 7 %; medulla: 99 ± 7 %). Insulin administration completely corrected the hyperglycemia-associated hypercalciuria and hypermagnesiuria, and reversed the increase of <b>calcium</b> and <b>magnesium</b> transporter abundance. In conclusion, our results demonstrated increased renal <b>calcium</b> and <b>magnesium</b> transporter abundance in STZ-induced diabetic rats, which may represent a compensatory adaptation for the increased load of <b>calcium</b> and <b>magnesium</b> to the distal tubule...|$|R

25|$|Many {{industries}} {{have a need}} to treat water to obtain very high quality water for demanding purposes such as environmental discharge compliance. Water treatment produces organic and mineral sludges from filtration and sedimentation. Ion exchange using natural or synthetic resins removes <b>calcium,</b> <b>magnesium</b> and carbonate ions from water, typically replacing them with sodium, chloride, hydroxyl and/or other ions. Regeneration of ion exchange columns with strong acids and alkalis produces a wastewater rich in hardness ions which are readily precipitated out, especially when in admixture with other wastewater constituents.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{latitude}} affects risk of osteoporotic fracture. Areas of higher latitude such as Northern Europe receive less Vitamin D through sunlight compared to regions closer to the equator, and consequently have higher fracture rates in comparison to lower latitudes. For example, Swedish men and women have a 13.% and 28.5% risk of hip fracture by age 50, respectively, whereas this risk is only 1.9% and 2.4% in Chinese men and women.

25|$|Mineral {{sequestration}} aims to trap {{carbon in}} the form of solid carbonate salts. This process occurs slowly in nature and is responsible for the deposition and accumulation of limestone over geologic time. Carbonic acid in groundwater slowly reacts with complex silicates to dissolve <b>calcium,</b> <b>magnesium,</b> alkalis and silica and leave a residue of clay minerals. The dissolved calcium and magnesium react with bicarbonate to precipitate calcium and magnesium carbonates, a process that organisms use to make shells. When the organisms die, their shells are deposited as sediment and eventually turn into limestone. Limestones have accumulated over billions of years of geologic time and contain much of Earth's carbon. Ongoing research aims to speed up similar reactions involving alkali carbonates.|$|E
