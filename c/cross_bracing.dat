25|$|The Dongó's wings {{were simply}} braced {{compared}} with most biplanes of the day, with an arrangement {{made possible by}} the narrow chord and large stagger. A single, vertical, faired interplane strut on each side braced the rear spar of the upper wing to the lower forward spar. Towards its top a metal faired-in oblique strut braced the forward, upper spar and there was a similar arrangement at its foot to the rear spar. To minimise drag, there were no conventional <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> flying wires but instead a single, faired diagonal strut from the top of each interplane struts to the corresponding lower fuselage longeron.|$|E
25|$|The T.III's {{alternative}} undercarriages {{were both}} fixed, {{with the two}} legs independent of each, avoiding the <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> which would have interfered with the bomb or torpedo release. Each mainwheel was on a horizontal axle supported at the outer end by a longitudinal V-strut from the wing underside. There were two more pairs of Vs, one fixed below the wing {{and the other on}} the lower fuselage, angled towards each other to support the inner end of the axle. A tailskid completed the undercarriage. The T.III's twin float undercarriage projected just forward of the nose. The floats were mounted on the fuselage by two sets of N-struts, with diagonal transverse bracing between them, on each float. Both wood and aluminium floats were available. Fitting floats added 243kg (536lb) to the unladened weight and reduced the maximum speed by 11km/h (7mph).|$|E
25|$|The pointed chancel arch is 13th century. It is moulded {{of three}} {{chamfers}} leading to respondshalf-piers {{against a wall}} supporting an archof three part round columns with continuous annulet between, and with polygonal capitals and base reflecting those of the arcade piers. At the spring of the arch are open cusped devices similar to those on the tower arch. The chancel roof is 19th century and of barrel vault construction. In the north wall of the chancel is a rectangular aumbry. In the south wall is an arched door, of planking over <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> and heavy surrounds, recessed within a plain right angle opening with pointed and chamfered double-arch head. From the 19th-century restoration are chancel altar rails, choir stalls, a brass eagle lectern, and a wood pulpit. The pulpit is octagonal with one side open and receiving steps. The upper level is moulded top and bottom, with each side paneled with inset tracery and quatrefoils, and is supported by scrolled brackets set on an inset base.|$|E
5000|$|Another way {{in which}} {{stretcher}} bars can be strengthened is by having a <b>cross</b> <b>brace</b> inserted. It is advised that lengths over 40" [...] or 1m be fitted with a <b>cross</b> <b>brace.</b> By doing this it ensures the wood will not warp and will hang flat.|$|R

500|$|Manjushri Temple, {{also called}} 'Jampe Lhakhang', {{is built around}} the four central images of Manjushri (seated back to back) seen on a common {{platform}} [...] that is [...] square. Four pillars form the enclosure for the images; the pillars are supported with <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> connected to the painted wood ceiling. The paintings on the wooden ceiling are [...] {{similar to those in}} the Sumtseg and the two chortens, but are unrefined. Located close to the Indus river, the temple is not well preserved except for wood carvings on the doors and pillars. The Lhotsava or Lotsawa temple to its left side is a later addition. The Manjushri images are on a common pedestal ( [...] high), painted recently to give [...] an overall picture of fright since the decorative scrolls are derived from the tails of Makara surrounded by images of animals, gods and symbols. The normal colour attributed to Manjushri images is orange, but in this temple they are depicted [...] with different colours.|$|E
2500|$|Designer Othmar Ammann {{had several}} {{plans for the}} bridge that would keep {{construction}} on its tight schedule. The two [...] towers were constructed in a short 18 days and {{were the first to}} have no diagonal <b>cross</b> <b>bracing.</b> Unlike other suspension bridges, the Whitestone Bridge did not have a stiffening truss system. Instead, [...] I-beam girders gave the bridge an art deco streamlined appearance.|$|E
2500|$|The Hols der Teufel {{was built}} (and named) by Alexander Schleicher in his {{factory in the}} valley below the Wasserkuppe. Detailed plans of it for amateur use were {{included}} in a book on glider building published by Jacobs in 1932 and led to its widespread construction. [...] The complete Schleicher version differed somewhat from the plans in several details, for example more rounded wing tips and span, different girder frame <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> and a wire, rather than strut braced tailplane.|$|E

2500|$|The all-important floats {{were similar}} to those Shorts had made for the Gloster III, single stepped, small heeled and long enough that the Mussel sat in flight {{position}} on the water, not on a tail float like their many earlier seaplanes. [...] This first set of floats was mounted with two pairs of struts to the lower fuselage fore and aft, with a pair of <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> struts between the floats. The Mussel also had a built in tail skid in anticipation of a landplane configuration.|$|E
2500|$|The lych gate, flanked on {{both sides}} by random rubble {{retaining}} walls, defines the main entrance to the church grounds {{at the corner of}} Vulture Street and Balmoral Terrace. Constructed from heavy timbers, it has decorative <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> and a gable roof, clad in metal roof sheeting and lined with timber tongue and groove boards. Curved brackets on the street-facing side form an archway, above which the words [...] "Seek and ye shall find" [...] are carved in Gothic-style script. Curved red concrete steps ascend from street level to the gate, before continuing as straight steps up to a red concrete pathway leading to the entrance porch.|$|E
2500|$|The rather tubby {{fuselage}} of the HD.15 had tubular cross-section longerons with similar, triangularly arranged, <b>cross</b> <b>bracing.</b> [...] The pilot's open cockpit {{was just}} behind the main wing spar, under a deep trailing edge cut-out to improve his upwards and forward vision. [...] Close behind was the observer's cockpit, fitted with a mounted pair of swivelling machine guns. [...] The fuselage was fabric covered from the pilot's cockpit aft. The Hispano engine, enclosed under a metal cowling, was cooled {{with a pair of}} circular cross-section radiators mounted ventrally between the undercarriage legs. [...] The HD.15 had a fixed conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels on a single axle mounted on the lower fuselage longerons by two pairs of V-struts.|$|E

2500|$|The Salmson {{engine was}} close cowled with {{fairings}} over each cylinder and drove a two blade propeller. [...] It was cooled with an Andre radiator mounted ventrally {{in the space}} between the fuselage and the lower wing. [...] The H.31's fuselage was built around four Duralumin tube longerons with triangular <b>cross</b> <b>bracing.</b> [...] Its external oval cross section was produced by longitudinal stringers over formers. The pilot's open cockpit, provided with a small, faired headrest was under the trailing edge of the upper wing. [...] The fuselage tapered only gently to the rear, where a roughly elliptical cantilever tailplane carrying split elevators was mounted on top. [...] The vertical tail was similarly rounded and low, with a rudder that extended down to the keel. [...] The fighter had a fixed conventional undercarriage with mainwheels on a fixed axle, supported by a pair of V-struts attached {{to the bottom of the}} lower wing to fuselage struts, and given lateral strength by cross-wire bracing. There was a tailskid.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structural}} fuselage of the Types M and N was {{a rectangular}} section, ash framed lattice girder with wire <b>cross</b> <b>bracing.</b> Poplar formers and stringers produced a more rounded, fabric covered section. The pilot sat well {{down in an}} open cockpit over the wing and behind the upper pylon. A wide range of engines were fitted, including the [...] Anzani three cylinder inverted Y radial engine, the [...] Anzani 6-cylinder two row radial and the [...] Gnome. The last, a rotary engine, was usually covered over the upper part to screen the pilot from oil spray; the Anzanis were mounted uncowled. They all drove large, rather broad chord propellers. [...] The very broad chord, low aspect ratio tailplane was constructed like the wing with a flexible rear surface acting both to improve stability and, by warping, act like conventional elevators, its trailing edge extending well beyond {{the end of the}} fuselage. [...] A small, near rectangular, one piece, rigid fin was pivoted near its leading edge from the extreme tail.|$|E
2500|$|The Blériot XI, largely {{designed}} [...] by Raymond Saulnier, was {{a development}} of the Blériot VIII, which Blériot had flown successfully in 1908. Like its predecessor, it was a tractor-configuration monoplane with a partially covered box-girder fuselage built from ash with wire <b>cross</b> <b>bracing.</b> [...] The principal difference {{was the use of}} wing warping for lateral control. [...] The tail surfaces consisted of a small balanced [...] "all-moving" [...] rudder mounted on the rearmost vertical member of the fuselage and a horizontal tailplane mounted under the lower longerons. This had elevator surfaces making up the outermost part of the fixed horizontal surface; these [...] "tip elevators" [...] were linked by a torque tube running through the inner section. [...] The bracing and warping wires [...] were attached to a dorsal, five-component [...] "house-roof" [...] shaped cabane consisting of a pair of inverted V struts with their apices connected by a longitudinal tube, and an inverted four-sided pyramidal ventral cabane, also of steel tubing, below. [...] When first built it had a wingspan of [...] and a small teardrop-shaped fin mounted on the cabane, which was later removed.|$|E

2500|$|The Dyott was a single-seat, mid-wing {{monoplane}} {{of clean}} appearance for its day. [...] The fuselage was built up around four longerons. [...] These were of ash in the stressed region from wing spars to engine, spruce {{at the rear}} and internally wire braced. [...] Stringers behind the cockpit formed a smooth rounded decking under the overall fabric covering. The forward fuselage, including the cockpit was aluminium clad, with a neat nose piece over the 7-cylinder, 50hp (37kW) Gnome rotary engine, more to protect the pilot from oil than for streamlining. Steel tubing was used in several places: the empennage was steel framed, as was [...] the pilot's seat, and steel tubes formed the vertical undercarriage members. [...] There were four of the latter, each pair mounting a short wooden skid with steel <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> and a single axle on shock absorbers carrying a pair of wheels. [...] The undercarriage was initially completed with a long sprung tail skid, later replaced by a shorter cane skid mounted further aft. At the same time, Dyott made some changes to the transverse bracing of the main undercarriage.|$|E
2500|$|The H.31 was {{a single}} bay biplane with {{straight}} edged, parallel chord wings with slight sweep and essentially no stagger; {{the leading edge of}} the lower wing was marginally behind that of the upper one because its chord was a little less. It also had a slightly smaller span. A single, wide chord, airfoil section interplane strut on each side, with widened roots to lower interference drag, separated the bays; on each side pairs of flying wires and landing wires provided <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> between these struts and the fuselage. The wings were built around twin Duralumin box main spars, with metal and wood ribs. [...] There were ailerons on the upper planes. [...] Neither wing was directly fuselage mounted but instead held off by pairs of N-form struts on each side. Those joining the lower wing to the low-mid fuselage were longer than those of the cabane and the lower forward component was itself a close pair. Both upper and lower wings had the common cut-outs to improve the pilot's vision but the H.31 had a forward, full chord slot between the upper wings as well.|$|E
50|$|In construction, <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> is {{a system}} {{utilized}} to reinforce building structures in which diagonal supports intersect. <b>Cross</b> <b>bracing</b> can increase a building’s capability to withstand seismic activity. Bracing is important in earthquake resistant buildings because it helps keep a structure standing. <b>Cross</b> <b>bracing</b> is usually seen with two diagonal supports placed in an X shaped manner; these support compression and tension forces. Depending on the forces, one brace may be in tension while the other is slack. It helps make buildings sturdier {{and more likely to}} withstand lateral forces. <b>Cross</b> <b>bracing</b> can be applied to any rectangular frame structure, such as chairs and bookshelves. In steel construction, steel cables may be used due to their great resistance to tension (although not resistant at all to compression). The common uses for <b>cross</b> <b>bracing</b> includes bridge (side) supports, along with structural foundations. This method of construction maximizes the weight of the load a structure is able to support.|$|E
