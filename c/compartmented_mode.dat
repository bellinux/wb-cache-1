The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model to describe the absorption characteristics of pregabalin given fasted or after meals. Data from five healthy subject PK studies (n= 88) of single- or multiple-dose pregabalin (150  mg) were used. Pregabalin was administered twice daily, without meals or 30  min after a meal (regular or high-fat diet) in the morning and 30  min or 4  h after a meal (regular diet) in the evening. Serial plasma samples were collected up to 24  h after the last dose for PK analysis. Because the peak concentrations were not properly modeled by a conventional first-order absorption model, Erlang frequency distribution, Weibull-type absorption, and transit compartment models were tested on a two-compartment linear PK model using a nonlinear mixed-effects method (NONMEM; version 7. 3). The transit compartment model best described the absorption characteristics of pregabalin regardless of meal status. We conclude that the absorption model should be carefully chosen based on the principle of model development and validation and not by following a conventional first-order absorption model for its popularity and simplicity, especially when the PK dataset includes densely sampled absorption-phase data.

40|$|Ca 2 �-binding {{proteins}} are ubiquitously expressed {{throughout the}} CNS {{and serve as}} valuable immunohistochemical markers for certain types of neurons. However, the functional role of most Ca 2 �-binding proteins has to date remained obscure because their concentration in central neurons is not known. In this study, we investigate the intracellular concentration of the widely expressed Ca 2 �-binding protein calbindin-D 28 k in adult hippocampal slices using patch-clamp recordings and immunohistochemistry. First, we show that calbindin-D 28 k freely exchanges between patch pipette and cytoplasm during whole cell patch-clamp recordings with a time constant of � 10 min. Substituting known concentrations of recombinant calbindin-D 28 k in patch pipettes enabled us to determine the endogenous calbindin-D 28 k concentration by postrecording immunohistochemistry. Using this calibration procedure, we find that mature granule cells (doublecortin�) contain � 40 �M, and newborn granule cells (doublecortin�) contain 0 – 20 �M calbindin-D 28 k. CA 3 stratum radiatum interneurons and CA 1 pyramidal cells enclose � 47 and � 45 �M calbindin-D 28 k, respectively. Numerical simulations showed that 40 �M calbindin-D 28 k is capable of tuning Ca 2 � microdomains associated with action potentials {{at the mouth of}} single or clustered Ca 2 � channels: calbindin-D 28 k reduces the increment in free Ca 2 � at a distance of 100 and 200 nm by 20 and 35 %, respectively, and strongly accelerates the collapse of the Ca 2 � gradient after cessation of Ca 2 � influx. These data suggest that calbindin-D 28 k equips hippocampal neurons with � 160 �M mobile, high-affinity Ca 2 �-binding sites (� S � 200) that slow and reduce global Ca 2 � signals while they enhance the spatiotemporal fidelity of submicroscopic Ca 2 � signals.

40|$|The {{explosive}} growth witnessed in the Internet {{over the last}} few years has encouraged companies to connect to it and to offer services to their customers over it. Concerns about security are holding them back from all but the most restrictive connectivity. This paper explores the use of a military development, the <b>Compartmented</b> <b>Mode</b> Workstation, in a commercial setting, as a platform that is secure enough to implement services that are accessed over the Internet. Two applications have been investigated in detail, a firewalled Domain Name System and a World Wide Web service with enhanced authentication. Finally, there is discussion of how other Internet-based services might benefit from the application of CMW technology.

40|$|Version 1. 05 Over {{the past}} several years there has been an {{increasing}} interest in windowing systems and security. Most of this interest has been in security aspects of the X Window System 1, while there has been some work in policy issues for windowing and in windowing systems other than X. Because X is a network protocol, it is susceptible to many types of attack foreign to other windowing systems. Additionally, X was designed without concern for security: the X designers frequently state that X provides (graphical) “mechanism without policy”, but in the area of security, X provides “policy without mechanism. ” Much of the interest in security has come from the government community, in particularly in the form of <b>Compartmented</b> <b>Mode</b> Workstations (CMWs). The commercial world is increasingly sensitive to issues of authentication in X, {{and to a lesser extent}} issues of audit and access control to X resources.

40|$|As the <b>Compartmented</b> <b>Mode</b> Workstation (CMW) {{market has}} matured, several vendors have {{released}} new versions of their CMW operating systems. These include {{a new version}} from SecureWare (CMW + Version 2. 4), and Sun`s CMW 1. 1 (also known as Trusted Solaris 1. 1). EC is now shipping MLS+ 3. 0 for DEC Alpha platforms. Relatively new entries in the market include Loral B 1 /CMW for IBM RS/ 6000 platforms and a SecureWare-based CMW for HP platforms (HP-UX 10. 09). With all these choices {{it is time for}} a comparative analysis of the features offered by the various vendors. The authors have three of the above five CMW systems plus HP-UX BLS 9. 09, which is a multilevel secure operating system (OS) targeted at the B 1 level but not a CMW. Each is unique in sometimes obvious, sometimes subtle ways, a situation that requires knowing and keeping straight a variety of commands {{to do the same thing}} on each system. Some vendors offer extensive GUI tools for system administration; some require entering command-line commands for certain system administration tasks. They examine the differences in system installation, system administration, and system operating among the systems. They look at trusted networking among the various systems and differences in the network databases and label encodings files.

Nonlinear finite element analysis is used to validate both the progressive collapse methodology and the analytical approach proposed for determining the buckling capacity of orthogonally stiffened substructures within the hill girder compartment. The research has been undertaken due to the continued growth {{in the size of}} large lightweight craft in both commercial and naval vessels, combined with increasing operability requirements for these vessels. The development of large and lightweight marine structures, predominantly built from aluminium alloy, has raised important issues regarding the response of the hull girder under primary hull girder bending.

40|$|Endocytosis is {{a common}} {{internalization}} pathway for cellular labeling with MRI contrast agents. However, the entrapment of the Gd(III) complexes into endosomes results in a "quenching" of the attainable relaxivity {{when the number of}} Gd(III) complexes reaches the number of ca. 1 × 10 (9) /cell. Herein we show that the use of the newly developed photochemical internalization technique provides an efficient method for attaining the endosomal escape of GdHPDO 3 A molecules entrapped by pinocytosis into different kind of cells. Furthermore, it has been found that a new "quenching" limit is observed when the number of Gd-HPDO 3 A complexes is ca. five times higher than the value observed for the endosome entrapped conditions. The observed behavior is explained in terms of the attainment of the conditions in which the difference in proton relaxation rates between the cytoplasmic and the extracellular compartment is higher than the exchange rate of water molecules across the cellular membrane. The experimental data points have been reproduced by using a properly designed theoretical <b>compartment</b> T(1) -relaxation <b>mode...</b>|$|R
40|$|Dysferlin {{is a type}} II trans{{membrane}} protein implicated in surface membrane repair in muscle. Mutations in dysferlin lead to limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2 B, Miyoshi Myopathy and distal anterior <b>compartment</b> myopathy. Dysferlin’s <b>mode</b> of action is not well understood {{and only a few}} protein binding partners have thus far been identified. Using affinity purification followed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, we identified alpha-tubulin as a novel binding partner for dysferlin. The association between dysferlin and alpha-tubulin, as well as between dysferlin and microtubules, was confirmed in vitro by glutathione S-transferase pulldown and microtubule binding assays. These interactions were confirmed in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation. Confocal microscopy revealed that dysferlin and alpha-tubulin co-localized in the perinuclear region and in vesicular structures in myoblasts, and along thin longitudinal structures reminiscent of microtubules in myotubes. We mapped dysferlin’s alpha-tubulin-binding region to its C 2 A and C 2 B domains. Modulation of calcium levels did not affect dysferlin binding to alpha-tubulin, suggesting that this interaction is calcium-independent. Our studies identified a ne...|$|R
40|$|Drug {{therapy is}} often {{directed}} to specific organ and tissue <b>compartments</b> where the <b>mode</b> of {{action of the}} compound effects specifically targeted biological processes. However, the direct measurement of drug uptake {{in terms of a}} time kinetic and concentrations attained at the local sites has not been readily available as a clinical index for most drugs. A proof-of-principle study was conducted to test the utility of applying MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) to demonstrate the qualitative distribution pattern of a locally administered drug within tissue sites of targeted action. Here we have measured the occurrence of an inhaled bronchodilator, the muscarinic receptor antagonist ipratropium, within human bronchial biopsies obtained by fiber optic bronchoscopy shortly after dosing exposure. Cryo-preserved biopsy samples from five subjects being evaluated for airway obstruction or potential tumor development were prepared as thin frozen sections. Samples coated with a MALDI matrix were analyzed by a MALDI LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer at large (100 μm) and small (30 μm) raster size. Our results demonstrate that ipratropium is rapidly absorbed into the airway wall. Ipratropium parent ion (m/z 332. 332) and daughter ions (m/z 166. 2 and 290. 2) were coincidently partitioned within submucosal spaces containing targeted airway smooth muscle in 4 / 5 subjects. The signal intensity of ipratropium fragment ions provided estimates that local drug concentrations between 3 - 80 nM were achieved within the airway wall. To our knowledge, this is the first reported study in man applying MALDI-MSI to demonstrate the localization of a drug administered at therapeutic levels. The study highlights the potential benefit of MALDI-MSI to provide important measurements of drug efficacy in clinical settings...|$|R
40|$|The {{mammalian}} skin is {{a versatile}} organ that protects from external harm, regulates the body temperature, {{and provides the}} touch sensation. Its epithelium, the epidermis, forms several highly regenerative structures as the hair follicle (HF), the sebaceous gland (SG), and the interfollicular epidermis (IFE). Lineage tracing experiments in mice have demonstrated that several basal cell populations in the IFE and HF {{have the capacity to}} renew the epidermis during homeostasis, and also contribute to wound healing and cancer formation. However, clear insights distinguishing the different stem cell populations and defining their exact spatio-temporal patterns of contribution were lacking. Expression of Lgr 5 marks stem cells located in the HF bulge and hair germ. We used lineage tracing of Lgr 5 -expressing (Lgr 5 +) cells in mice to investigate how wound healing affects the capacity of epidermal stem cells to initiate skin cancer. Induction of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) through activation of Hedgehog signalling in the entire basal layer confirmed that wounding strongly increases the incidence and severity of BCC-like lesions. Targeting the oncogenic mutation to Lgr 5 + cells revealed that transformed HF cells are able to leave their natural environment and establish tumours in the IFE in response to wounding. Thus, wounding activates HF stem cells to expand and migrate to unaffected tissue areas, thereby augmenting BCC development. Since it was discovered that Lgr 6 is another epidermal stem cell marker, we set out to explore the role of Lgr 6 + stem cells during epidermal homeostasis. Detailed analysis of the lineagetracing pattern of the Lgr 6 + cells populations in the isthmus, SG, and IFE disclosed that these resident Lgr 6 + populations independently maintain their respective <b>compartment.</b> The <b>mode</b> of tissue renewal displayed by all three Lgr 6 + cell populations was in accordance with a stochastic division of one type of progenitor cell. These results highlight that stochastic stem cell renewal is relevant in many types of rapidly proliferating epithelia. We further investigated the susceptibility of the different epidermal compartments harbouring Lgr 6 + stem cells towards BCC initiation and evaluated the influence of the microenvironment on tumour formation. Knockout of Ptch 1 in Lgr 6 + cells resulted in highly accelerated BCC development within the HF isthmus and the touch dome niches in the IFE. The touch dome and the isthmus are both associated with cutaneous nerve fibres, and show several morphological and molecular features that are highly similar to BCC. This demonstrates that these two niches promote the response of the epithelial cells to the oncogenic stimulus. In summary, tracking the fate of Lgr 5 - and Lgr 6 -expressing epidermal stem cells during homeostasis, wound healing and early cancer formation shed light on the similarities and differences between distinct stem cell populations in the skin. The results illustrate how stem cell renewal is achieved, elucidate the early steps of skin cancer development, and underline the influence of the microenvironment on the behaviour of tissue stem cells...|$|R
