30|$|A final {{explanation}} for the limited extent of inter-tenant information sharing reported in our study {{was the lack of}} knowledge about other tenants. Without the necessary knowledge, it was difficult to identify potential synergies and areas for collaboration. All incubator firms had some contact with other tenants, but they lacked the comprehensive and detailed knowledge about the other firms required to exploit this potential fully. The entrepreneurs recognized that internal networking could be strengthened within the incubator. More informal <b>contact,</b> common <b>seminars</b> where tenants present their projects, and a more developed “sharing” culture could remedy this. The above findings have also been identified in previous research (e.g., Cooper et al. 2012; Tötterman and Sten 2005).|$|R
40|$|The Northern Michigan Environmental Research Program was {{conducted}} by the University of Michigan's Biological Station and Institute for Social Research to obtain information about the aquatic and human resources of water-rich, resort-oriented northern lower Michigan.

Multiple methods were used to communicate study results, including self-contained information briefs, regular <b>contacts</b> and <b>seminars</b> with community leaders and public officials, and mass media. Selected illustrations of project data applied to environmental management problems are cited, e. g., curtailment of nutrient loadings, wetlands protection, improved effectiveness of riparian organizations, and highway planning. A series of short Lakeland Reports, designed to present factual information, general environmental principles, and action implications to a lay audience, proved to be effective. However, it became apparent that environmental decisions were not strongly affected by reports alone. Instead, several mutually reinforcing channels of communication must be employed to develop a climate of receptiveness and understanding to insure environmentally sound decisions...|$|R

It incorporates many valuable comments from colleagues in the Climate, Energy and Environmental Risk Directorate of Defra and the Department of Trade and Industry. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to draw attention to some issues that we have initially identified as priorities for a debate on SCC estimates and their subsequent application to policy assessment. These include the wide range of estimates indicated by different studies, the dependency of SCC estimates on value judgments, the partial coverage of current SCC estimates and the appropriate way of applying them to policy decision-making in conditions of uncertainty.

The plans did not materialize, so Swenson decided to instead co-organize a local music festival, with the help of two other people at the Chronicle: editor and co-founder Louis Black, and publisher Nick Barbaro. Louis Meyers, a booking agent and musician, was also brought on board. Black came up with the name, as a play on the name of the Alfred Hitchcock film North by Northwest. The event was first held in March 1987. The organizers considered it a regional event and expected around 150 attendees to show up, but over 700 came, and according to Black [...] "it was national almost immediately." ...|$|R
30|$|The {{traditional}} face-to-face lectures {{were replaced}} with a flipped approach for 6 weeks. However, considering that many students do not have computers or internet at home, one of the 3 weekly classes of 50  min in this period was replaced with online learning according to the blended learning design proposed by Picciano (2009). This slot on the timetable allowed for self-study which included viewing the online videos and downloading the other online material using campus internet, harnessing the ample student computers available on campus in the library and computer labs, as well as unlimited free internet on campus. Students could alternatively download the material on their smart phones using the Blackboard Student ™ application. Two adjacent class slots provided sufficient <b>contact</b> time for <b>seminar</b> activities aimed at theory application. The third component of the semester course consisted of a group project, where students collaboratively researched a given topic and created artefacts for assessment. (Work-place readiness was a high priority and each cohort completed {{a different kind of}} group project, which is not discussed in this paper. Other resources or activities that differed from year to year are not discussed either).|$|R
40|$|Using mixed methods {{research}} design, {{the current}} study has analyzed Iranian researchers’ information searching behaviour on the Web. Then based on extracted concepts, the model of their information searching behavior was revealed.. Forty-four participants, including academic staff from universities and research centers were recruited for this study selected by purposive sampling. Data were gathered from questionnairs including ten questions and semi-structured interview. Each participant’s memos were analyzed using grounded theory methods adapted from Strauss & Corbin (1998). Results showed that the main objectives of subjects were doing a research, writing a paper, studying, doing assignments, downloading files and acquiring public information in using Web. The most important of learning about how to search and retrieve information were trial and error and get help from friends among the subjects. Information resources are identified by searching in information resources (e. g. search engines, references in papers, and search in Online database…) communications facilities & tools (e. g. <b>contact</b> with colleagues, <b>seminars</b> & workshops, social networking [...] .), and information services (e. g. RSS, Alerting, and SDI). Also, Findings indicated that searching by search engines, reviewing references, searching in online databases, and contact with colleagues and studying last issue of the electronic journals {{were the most important}} for searching. The most important strategies were using search engines and scientific tools such as Google Scholar. In addition, utilizing from simple (Quick) search method was the most common among subjects. Using of topic, keywords, title of paper were most important of elements for retrieval information. Analysis of interview showed that there were nine stages in researchers’ information searching behaviour: topic selection, initiating search, formulating search query, information retrieval, access to information, information evaluation, information selection, information management, and stop/ continue. These stages located in greater four categories: search initiation behaviors, formulating search queries, search navigational behaviors, and information processing behaviors. The study contributes to the theoretical basis of Web search research. It also raises various questions within the context of user studies...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Education)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. The {{application}} of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as supportive tool {{in teaching and}} learning {{within the framework of the}} radical change that Outcomes Based Education (OBE) has created, pervades and consequently alters the pedagogy and methodology of Geography teaching. Geography Is a subject in which ICT can make a definite and worthwhile contribution and it is, therefore, important that Geography educators know how to harness the benefits of ICT for their learners. Apart from the general availability of ICT to fulfil the requirements of the curricula, there are pressures from the world outside the classroom in the form of professionals who utilize Geography in their profession, such as town planners and meteorologists, who utilise new technology such as GIs, GPS, satellite images, radar summaries, air charts and meteograms as an integral part of their work. The Internet, the World Wide Web and CD-Rom are used progressively as resource-based and communication tools {{in teaching and learning}} throughout the world. The challenge to utilise ICT in Geography teaching and learning occurs in a world experiencing increasing disparities between the rich and poor, among and within nations. For example, while 72. 7 % of Americans currently use the Internet, only 6. 4 % of South Africans have access to and use the Internet. A solution for sufficient ICT support in teaching and learning for developing countries is to focus on ICT variants that are affordable and that will sustain movement toward fulfilling development objectives. Developing countries (such as the RSA) need to consider alternatives to ICT that maximise the Impact of ICT and that entail balancing investment in computers with investment in other technologies that might be cheaper and equally effective. The use of alternative ICT variants must, however, be globally competitive, but at the same time be cost-effective. The ability, versatility and low cost of an ICT variant such as the Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) suggest that it can serve this purpose. ICT supports teaching and learning in Geography in many ways and has an impact on the quality of learners' learning experience and the depth of their learning. It can be a tool for inquiry learning, a resource for obtaining secondary source material, an aid in measuring physical events and situations, models real-world situations, helps to communicate and present information, improves efficiency and pace of workload, provides resources and structure to support learning independently of the educator and improves the quality of task outcomes for learners. The introduction of OBE in South Africa since 1994 has also encouraged learner-centred teaching and learning and has required a paradigm shift away from the traditional content-based transmission model of teaching and learning. The purpose of this study is to: • determine whether or not the DVD method can support the teaching and learning of Geography teacher students effectively; • determine how the DVD alters the format, structure and number of traditional formal Geography lectures; • determine what the nature of the information on the DVD must be in order to be perceived by the students effectively; • Investigate the effect of the utilisation of the DVD on the academic performance of Geography teacher students; and • develop a model for the effective integration and utilisation of the DVD in fulltime Geography teaching and learning. An action research method constituted the backbone of this study. The action research included a combined qualitative and quantitative research method in the form of a cross-sectional study as part of a developmental research method, in order to develop and evaluate a proposed model for the effective integration and utilisation of the DVD in Geography teaching and learning. The participants in this study included the entire population of the full-time, second-year students of the Economic Geography module, GEOH 251 of 2004, 2005 and 2006 of the B. Ed (teaching degree) of the North-West University (Potchefstroom Campus). The results of the study can be summarised as follows: This study indicated that the majority of the GEOH 251 students were positive regarding the integration of the DVD in Geography teaching and learning. The DVD-method teaching approach challenges lecturers and students to fulfil new roles within the teaching and learning environment. The results of this study indicate the following: The integration of the DVD method can support the teaching and learning of Geography teacher students effectively. The utilisation of the DVD, together with a seminar format with a specific procedure, enhances the teaching and learning of Geography. The DVD with all the different types of information included thereon was well received by the Geography students and was deemed effective. The integration of the DVD into Geography teaching and learning evidently did not result in poorer academic performances of students in the GEOH 251 module. The proposed model provides clear guidelines on how to integrate the DVD In Geography teaching and learning. It explains how the DVD should be compiled, what to include and how to employ it effectively in conjunction with seminars. It also describes the transition of formal <b>contact</b> sessions to <b>seminars,</b> which occur less frequently than traditional contact sessions, but with regular weekly intervals, as well as explains the seminar proceedings, interactions and timeframes. The DVD can be integrated into Geography teaching and learning effectively if the procedures, steps, and actions, as expounded in the proposed model, are applied. The advantages of the DVD as ICT variant in Geography teaching and learning can be clearly seen, especially if it can be implemented in developing countries. Doctora...|$|R
