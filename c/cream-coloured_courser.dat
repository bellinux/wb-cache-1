60|$|Though these shaggy hills were {{apparently}} so solitary, several keen round eyes were always ready {{on such a}} wintry morning as this to converge upon a passer-by. Feathered species sojourned here in hiding which would have created wonder if found elsewhere. A bustard haunted the spot, and not many years before this five and twenty might have been seen in Egdon at one time. Marsh-harriers {{looked up from the}} valley by Wildeve's. A <b>cream-coloured</b> <b>courser</b> had used to visit this hill, a bird so rare that not more than a dozen have ever been seen in England; but a barbarian rested neither night nor day till he had shot the African truant, and after that event cream-coloured coursers thought fit to enter Egdon no more.|$|E

50|$|This courser is {{widespread}} in South Asia and overlaps {{with some other}} species such as the similar looking <b>cream-coloured</b> <b>courser.</b> This species is however brighter coloured than the <b>cream-coloured</b> <b>courser</b> and has a broader black eye-stripe that begins {{at the base of}} the beak. The crown is chestnut and the breast is rufous. The nape has a dark black patch where the long longer feathers forming the white stripe meet. In flight, the rump appears white and the wing tip is not as contrastingly black as in the <b>cream-coloured</b> <b>courser.</b> The sexes are alike.|$|E
50|$|Hayman's Shorebirds {{treats the}} east African form littoralis as {{a race of}} the Somali courser rather than of cream-colored. Some {{authorities}} in turn consider the Somali, Burchell's and <b>cream-coloured</b> <b>coursers</b> to be conspecific.|$|R
40|$|Background: Relatively {{little is}} known about the {{prevalence}} of blood parasites in shorebirds, especially those breeding in the tropics. The prevalence of blood parasites of the genera Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon was assessed in blood samples from Kentish plovers and <b>cream-coloured</b> <b>coursers</b> in Cape Verde, and samples of Kittlitz's plovers, Madagascar plovers and white-fronted plovers in Madagascar. Results: Only two of these samples were positive for Plasmodium: a Kittlitz's plover was infected by a generalist lineage of Plasmodium that has already been reported in Europe and Africa, while in a white-fronted plover direct sequencing revealed a previously un-described Plasmodium lineage. Conclusion: Potential explanations for the low prevalence of blood parasites include the scarcity of vectors in habitats used by these bird species and their resistance to parasitic infections...|$|R

5000|$|... a <b>cream-coloured</b> <b>courser</b> (Cursorius cursor) in 2004 was {{the first}} to be seen in Britain for 20 years.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cream-coloured</b> <b>courser</b> (Cursorius cursor) is a wader in the {{pratincole}} and courser family, Glareolidae. Both {{parts of}} the scientific name derive from Latin cursor, [...] "runner", from currere, [...] "to run".|$|E
50|$|The Dawlish Warren {{nature reserve}} {{provides}} a major roosting site for wading birds and migratory waterfowl, {{and serves as}} a habitat for the endangered petalwort plant. It is also one of only two sites in Britain where the sand crocus (Romulea columnae) grows. A large number of rare vagrant birds have been recorded at Dawlish Warren, including elegant tern, lesser crested tern, long-billed murrelet, greater sand plover, semipalmated plover, <b>cream-coloured</b> <b>courser</b> and great spotted cuckoo. Some sand lizards have also been spotted at the reserve, as a result of re-introductions.|$|E
50|$|Some {{species of}} {{pratincole}} are long-distance migrants. Shorter migrations include {{those of the}} Madagascan pratincole, which migrates from its breeding grounds in Madagascar to East Africa; in contrast the black-winged pratincole migrates from the steppes of Eastern Europe and Central Asia to West and Southern Africa. The migration, which can measure 10,000 km in distance, is often undertaken as a single non-stop flight and is flown at high altitude. The coursers are not particularly migratory, although the <b>cream-coloured</b> <b>courser</b> does migrate from the northern extremes of its range in the winter. The coursers are fairly nomadic, but do not undertake long distance migrations.|$|E
5000|$|The {{village of}} Aral Nani also {{includes}} a 3-star luxurious hotel [...] "Infinity Rann Of Kutch" [...] located in Khatau Wadi region of this village. Aral Nani {{is located in a}} small band of land, just inland from the coast, where four distinct ecosystems (desert, coastal, grassland and upland) exists within a span of 100 km. Huge wetlands are created in a good monsoon year providing excellent habitat for resident and migratory birds, including the Flamingo City, which is the largest and the only known breeding ground of greater and lesser flamingos in India. The area together with the Banni grasslands and other smaller wetlands like Chari-Dhand Wetland Conservation Reserve {{is one of the best}} areas to see rare bird species like the grey hypocolius, Eurasian eagle-owl, common crane, Dalmatian pelican, houbara bustard, curlew sandpiper, sociable plover, <b>cream-coloured</b> <b>courser</b> and Indian skimmer.|$|E
40|$|Niche theory {{predicts that}} coexisting species with similar trophic {{requirements}} should demonstrate resource partitioning, particularly where resources are scarce. Conversely, {{this is not}} expected between species that do not share primary resources. This study analyses the patterns of spatial coexistence and habitat selection, on two spatial scales, of three species of semidesert regions in Morocco: the Black-bellied Sandgrouse (Pterocles orientalis), the Stone Curlew (Burhinus oedicnemus) and the <b>Cream-coloured</b> <b>Courser</b> (Cursorius cursor). Co-occurrence analysis results point to between-species segregation on a macrohabitat scale. Hotelling's T test of the species-presence data showed a pattern of macrohabitat selection that diverged from habitat availability for the three species with differences among them. Both the classification tree and the pattern of microhabitat selection obtained by model averaging showed scant overlap between the Sandgrouse and the Courser, suggesting habitat partitioning between them on a fine scale. Our results confirm spatial segregation of the three species, especially between species with different trophic strategies: the Sandgrouse versus the Stone Curlew and the Courser. The latter two species were best segregated on a microhabitat scale, supporting the conclusions that macro- and microhabitat selection are major factors in bird community configuration in arid ecosystems and contributing to reduce potential competition.
