60|$|Christie {{saw this}} wish, {{and tried to}} gratify it with a dutiful affection which could not fail to win its way. Baby unconsciously lent a hand, for Uncle Enos could not long {{withstand}} the sweet enticements of this little kinswoman. He did not own the conquest in words, but was seen to cuddle his small <b>captivator</b> in private; allowed all sorts of liberties with his spectacles, his pockets, and bald pate; and never seemed more comfortable than when she confiscated his newspaper, and sitting on his knee read it {{to him in a}} pretty language of her own.|$|E
6000|$|Two fish-pools {{irradiated}} {{by a pair}} {{of stars}} would not kindle to greater warmth than did those elderly orbs into which Harry poured his gaze. Nevertheless, he plunged into their blue depths, and fancied he saw heaven in their calm brightness. So that silly dog (of whom Aesop or the Spelling-book used to tell us in youth) beheld a beef-bone in the pond, and snapped at it, and lost the beef-bone he was carrying. O absurd cur! He saw the beefbone in his own mouth reflected in the treacherous pool, which dimpled, I dare say, with ever so many smiles, coolly sucked up the meat, and returned to its usual placidity. Ah! what a heap of wreck lie beneath some of those quiet surfaces! What treasures we have dropped into them! What chased golden dishes, what precious jewels of love, what bones after bones, and sweetest heart's flesh! Do not some very faithful and unlucky dogs jump in bodily, when they are swallowed up heads and tails entirely? When some women come to be dragged, it is a marvel what will be found in the depths of them. Cavete, canes! Have a care how ye lap that water. What do they want with us, the mischievous siren sluts? A green-eyed Naiad never rests until she has inveigled a fellow under the water; she sings after him, she dances after him; she winds round him, glittering tortuously; she warbles and whispers dainty secrets at his cheek, she kisses his feet, she leers at him from out of her rushes: all her beds sigh out, [...] "Come, sweet youth! Hither, hither, rosy Hylas!" [...] Pop goes Hylas. (Surely the fable is renewed for ever and ever?) Has his <b>captivator</b> any pleasure? Doth she take any account of him? No more than a fisherman landing at Brighton does of one out of a hundred thousand herrings.... The last time. Ulysses rowed by the Sirens' bank, he and his men did not care though a whole shoal of them were singing and combing their longest locks. Young Telemachus was for jumping overboard: but the tough old crew held the silly, bawling lad. They were deaf, and could not hear his bawling nor the sea-nymphs' singing. They were dim of sight, and did not see how lovely the witches were. The stale, old, leering witches! Away with ye! I dare say you have painted your cheeks by this time; your wretched old songs are as out of fashion as Mozart, and it is all false hair you are combing! ...|$|E
50|$|A {{structure}} {{made only}} out {{of wood and}} glue had to be provided by the team to be tested at a tournament. The structure also had {{to function as a}} golf ball holder. A golf ball delivery device also had to be made by the team. A story about a <b>captivator</b> had to be presented alongside the structure. Two items of the teams choosing would be scored additionally as Team Choice Elements.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{assessment}} of aroma active compounds in gooseberry and sensory analysis of it focusing on flavour. The theoretical part describes general characteristics, biological marks and properties of selected varieties, healing abilities, the active substances contained in gooseberry fruits and their use. The aim of the experimental part was to determine aroma-active substances contained in fruits of nineteen selected cultivars of gooseberry using SPME-GC-FID method. In total 45 volatile compounds were identified, among them 17 alcohols, 11 aldehydes, 6 ketones, 9 esters and 2 acids. For a better identification one sample (<b>Captiv√°tor</b> variety) was also analysed using GC-MS with purge and trap extraction. Pentan- 1 -ol, hexanal, pentanal, ethylethanoate, ethylbutanoate, methylethanoate, methylbutanoate and ethanol were confirmed using mass spectra. Only several cultivars were selected {{for the assessment of}} overall sensory quality and palatability of fruits. Karmen and Remarka varieties were considered as the best samples by assessors...|$|E
