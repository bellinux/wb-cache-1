5|$|Pleased {{with the}} success of {{operations}} in Élisabethville, Prem Chand decided to immediately <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> with the UN's plans. In the afternoon of 30 December the head of the Swedish battalion at Kamina Air Base, Överstelöjtnant Bengt Fredman, received orders to advance upon the gendarmerie encampments in Kamina early the following morning. The gendarmes had expected an attack on 30 December, but when one failed to occur they began to drink beer and fire flares at random, possibly to boost morale. Rogue bands of gendarmes subsequently conducted random raids around the city and looted the local bank.|$|E
5|$|Mercator {{now turned}} to the modern maps, as author but no longer engraver: the practicalities of {{production}} of maps and globes had been passed to his sons and grandsons. In 1585 he issued a collection of 51 maps covering France, the Low Countries and Germany. Other maps may have followed in good order had not the misfortunes of life intervened: his wife Barbara died in 1586 and his eldest son Arnold died the following year so that only Rumold and the sons of Arnold were left to <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> his business. In addition, {{the time he had}} available for cartography was reduced by a burst of writing on philosophy and theology: a substantial written work on the Harmonisation of the Gospels as well as commentaries on the epistle of St. Paul and the book of Ezekiel.|$|E
5|$|Tanks were {{primarily}} {{used on the}} Western Front. The first offensive {{of the war in}} which tanks were used en masse was the battle of Cambrai in 1917; 476 tanks started the attack, and the German front collapsed. At midday the British had advanced five miles behind the German line. The battle of Amiens in 1918 saw the value of the tank being appreciated; 10 heavy and two light battalions of 414 tanks were included in the assault. 342 Mark Vs and 72 Whippets were backed up by a further 120 tanks designed to <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> supplies for the armour and infantry. By {{the end of the first}} day of the attack, they had penetrated the German line by , 16,000 prisoners were taken. In September 1918, the British Army was the most mechanised army in the world. Some 22,000 men had served in the Tank Corps by the end of the war.|$|E

30|$|Recognizing the {{existence}} of loss <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> and <b>carried</b> backward in the US corporate tax system, Mackie–Mason (1990) analysed {{the effects of the}} marginal tax rate on debt policy. He found that when a company has loss <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> and investment tax credit (i.e., another tax shield), it is less likely to raise capital by new debt issue. Since both existing loss <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> and investment tax credit are substitutes for new debt issue in terms of tax savings, this result is consistent with the trade-off theory.|$|R

25|$|The Mumbai attack also {{triggered}} {{a chain of}} citizens' movements across India.

The gathering of citizens at the Gateway of India in Mumbai was unprecedented and historic. From India Gate and Jantar Mantar in New Delhi to marketplaces and street corners all across the country, India witnessed candlelight vigils by the common people. Some organised initiatives to <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> the citizens' movement included a Hindustan Times-CNN-IBN Initiative, India Today Group's War Against Terror, and , besides a large number of blogs on the issue.|$|E
25|$|It was however Ravi Varma's {{daughters who}} were {{singled out by}} destiny for greatness, {{although}} not {{in the field of}} art, nor personally, but through their daughters. The three daughters of Ravi Varma and Bhageerthi Bayi were Mahaprabha Amma (who features in two of Varma's most famous paintings), Uma Amma (named after Varma's mother) and Cheria Kochamma. In 1900 CE, the Royal House of Travancore once again faced a succession crisis. Bhageerthi's two elder sisters, who had been adopted in order to <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> the lineage, had failed to produce the desired heirs. They had had six children between them, but only two of those had survived, and both were boys (who also, incidentally, later died childless). According to the matrilineal Marumakkathayam system, the succession to the throne could only progress through females, and therefore it was necessary to make an adoption. Tradition dictated that two girls belonging to branches of the Royal Family be adopted together. They would be designated the Senior and Junior Rani of Attingal, and the succession to the throne of Travancore would be vested in their progeny, in accordance with the unusual and unique Marumakkathayam system of succession.|$|E
