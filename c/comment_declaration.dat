50|$|Coding {{conventions}} are a set {{of guidelines}} for a specific programming language that recommend programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of a program written in that language. These conventions usually cover file organization, indentation, <b>comments,</b> <b>declarations,</b> statements, white space, naming conventions, programming practices, , , architectural best practices, etc. These are guidelines for software structural quality. Software programmers are highly recommended to follow these guidelines to help improve the readability of their source code and make software maintenance easier. Coding conventions are only applicable to the human maintainers and peer reviewers of a software project. Conventions may be formalized in a documented set of rules that an entire team or company follows, or may be as informal as the habitual coding practices of an individual. Coding conventions are not enforced by compilers.|$|R

40|$|The {{rigidity}} {{associated with}} formal international law has induced states {{and international organizations}} to resort to <b>declarations,</b> <b>comments,</b> guidelines, and other "informal" international instruments. Despite their informality, many of these nontreaty instruments have prompted actions at the domestic level, including before domestic courts. This Article analyzes on what basis domestic courts apply informal international instruments. Given that the "bindingness" is not always available as an explanatory factor, the normative basis for giving effect to informal instruments has {{to be found in}} the persuasiveness of instruments. Yet, what makes a particular instrument persuasive in the eyes of a domestic court remains unclear. The uncertainty in the notion of persuasiveness on the one hand empowers domestic courts in the development of international norms. On the other hand, the uncertainty renders unstable the legitimacy of judicial engagement and generates the varied judicial amenability to informal international instruments...|$|R

The report of the speech of the minister in a great assembly, which I have read, is a <b>comment</b> upon the <b>Declaration.</b> Without inquiry how far that report is exact, (inferior I believe it may be to what it would represent,) yet still it reads as a most eloquent and finished performance. Hardly one galling circumstance of the indignities offered by the Directory of Regicide to the supplications made to that junto in his Majesty's name has been spared. Every one of the aggravations attendant on these acts of outrage is, with wonderful perspicuity and order, brought forward in its place, and in the manner most fitted to produce its effect. They are turned to every point of view in which they can be seen to the best advantage. All the parts are so arranged as to point out their relation, and to furnish a true idea of the spirit of the whole transaction.|$|R

40|$|The {{rigidity}} {{associated with}} formal international law has induced states {{and international organizations}} to resort to <b>declarations,</b> <b>comments,</b> guidelines and other "informal" international instruments. Despite their informality, many of these non-treaty instruments are adopted {{with the expectation that}} actions would be taken at the domestic level. This paper analyzes how and on what basis domestic courts indeed apply informal international instruments. The limited survey of judicial practices unveils that judicial references to informal international instruments, albeit in many cases symbolic, influence the outcome and give rise to the question of justification. The degree of influence and the need for justification vary depending on the purposes for which instruments are employed, the types of instruments, and the weight they carry in the judicial reasoning. The justification offered explicitly or implicitly by domestic courts in resorting to non-treaty documents is the persuasiveness, as opposed to bindingness, of instruments. Yet what constitutes persuasiveness remains unclear, and this uncertainty renders unstable the legitimacy of judicial engagement with informal instruments. While we identified the systematic association with treaties, the independence of institutions that adopt informal instruments, and the wider public acceptance as possible variables that constitute persuasiveness, these rather non-substantive criteria do not exhaust possibly more value-laden factors which determine judicial reference to informal international instruments...|$|R

Citing the deaths of MidWesterners in the northern riots and the region's antebellum support for a confederal government, Okonkwo declared that the new state would support Biafra in all causes and would participate in organisations such as the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organisation of African Unity. However, Okonkwo knew that the new state could not last: he and other officials had discussed an independence declaration on 5 September without coming to agreement, and the announcement was recorded in a short lull as he and his military forces retreated {{in the face of a}} federal military advance. Later in the same day, federal forces reached Benin City, and the British High Commissioner reported crowds lining the streets to celebrate the reconquest. [...] Meanwhile, President Ojukwu offered no <b>comment</b> on the <b>declaration,</b> concentrating instead on Biafran soldiers' failure to stop the enemy. His attention to Okonkwo's military failures and lack of comment on the independence declaration suggests that Biafran officials may have been planning for the declaration of the Republic and that their objections referred to its timing, rather than its occurrence. Biafra won outside recognition from some foreign states, but all gains were unrelated to the proclamation of Benin, and the Biafran occupation of the region failed to achieve its objectives while goading the federal government into full-fledged war.|$|R
