6000|$|It is {{not easy}} to gather from this {{confession}} whether Prideaux had or had not read the books he [...] "coated." [...] It is certain that Dean Aldrich (and here again we recognise the eternal criticism of modern Oxford) held a poor opinion of Humphrey Prideaux. Aldrich said Prideaux was [...] "incorrect," [...] "muddy-headed," [...] "he would do little or nothing besides heaping up notes"; [...] "as for MSS. he would not trouble himself about any, but rest wholly upon what had been done to his hands by former editors." [...] This habit of carping, this trick of <b>collecting</b> <b>notes,</b> this inability to put a work through, this dawdling erudition, this horror of manuscripts, every Oxford man knows them, and feels those temptations which seem to be in the air. Oxford is a discouraging place. College drudgery absorbs the hours of students in proportion to their conscientiousness. They have only the waste odds-and-ends of time for their own labours. They live in an atmosphere of criticism. They <b>collect</b> <b>notes,</b> they wait, they dream; their youth goes by, and the night comes when no man can work. The more praise to the tutors and lecturers who decipher the records of Assyria, or patiently collate the manuscripts of the Iliad, who not only teach what is already known, but add to the stock of knowledge, and advance the boundaries of scholarship and science.|$|R
