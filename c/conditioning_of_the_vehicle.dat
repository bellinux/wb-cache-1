However, the vaporisation-compression-type refrigerating machines cause heavy pollution to <b>the</b> environment (gap <b>of</b> ozone layer problem), there-fore the interest in the cold air refrigerating machines has been greatly aroused lately. In the paper, the operation, theory and application possibilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cold air refrigerating machines are dealt with, especially considering <b>the</b> air- <b>conditioning</b> <b>of</b> motor <b>vehicles.</b> <b>The</b> improvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy <b>of</b> cold air refrigerating machines is especially paid great attention in this paper.

40|$|In {{order to}} meet <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Energy's (DOE's) FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies (FVCT) goals for volume, weight, efficiency, reliability, and cost, <b>the</b> cooling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power {{electronic}} devices, traction motors, and generators is critical. Currently the power electronic devices, traction motors, and generators in a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) are primarily cooled by water-ethylene glycol (WEG) mixture. The cooling fluid operates as a single-phase coolant as <b>the</b> liquid phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WEG does not change to its vapor phase during the cooling process. In these single-phase systems, two cooling loops of WEG produce a low temperature (around 70 C) cooling loop for the power electronics and motor/generator, and higher temperature loop (around 105 C) for the internal combustion engine. There is another coolant option currently available in automobiles. It is possible to use the transmission oil as a coolant. The oil temperature exists at approximately 85 C which can be utilized to cool the power electronic and electrical devices. Because heat flux {{is proportional to the}} temperature difference between the device's hot surface and the coolant, a device that can tolerate higher temperatures enables the device to be smaller while dissipating <b>the</b> same amount <b>of</b> heat. Presently, new silicon carbide (SiC) devices and high temperature direct current (dc) -link capacitors, such as Teflon capacitors, are available but at significantly higher costs. Higher junction temperature (175 C) silicon (Si) dies are gradually emerging in the market, which will eventually help to lower hardware costs for cooling. <b>The</b> development <b>of</b> high-temperature devices {{is not the only way}} to reduce device size. Two-phase cooling that utilizes <b>the</b> vaporization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquid to dissipate heat is expected to be a very effective cooling method. Among two-phase cooling methods, different technologies such as spray, jet impingement, pool boiling and submersion, etc. are being developed. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is leading the research on a novel floating refrigerant loop that cools high-power electronic devices and the motor/generator with very low cooling energy. The loop can be operated independently or attached to <b>the</b> air <b>conditioning</b> system <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> to share <b>the</b> condenser and other mutually needed components. The ability to achieve low cooling energy in the floating loop is attributable to the liquid refrigerant operating at its hot saturated temperature (around 50 C+). In an air conditioning system, the liquid refrigerant is sub-cooled for producing cool air to the passenger compartment. The ORNL floating loop avoids <b>the</b> sub-cooling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquid refrigerant and saves significant cooling energy. It can raise <b>the</b> coefficient <b>of</b> performance (COP) more than 10 fold from that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing air-conditioning system, where the COP is <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cooled power and the input power for dissipating the cooled power. In order to thoroughly investigate emerging two-phase cooling technologies, ORNL subcontracted three university/companies to look into three leading two-phase cooling technologies. ORNL's assessments on these technologies are summarized in Section I. Detailed descriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reports by the three university/companies (subcontractors) are in Section II...|$|R
