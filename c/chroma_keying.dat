5|$|Interest in {{creating}} a sequel to Tron arose after the film garnered a cult following. After much speculation, Walt Disney Pictures began a concerted effort in 2005 to devise Tron: Legacy, with the hiring of Klugman and Sternthal as writers. Kosinski was recruited as director two years later. As he was not optimistic about Disney's Matrix-esque approach to the film, Kosinski filmed a high-concept, which he used to conceptualise the universe of Tron: Legacy and convince the studio to greenlight the film. Principal photography took place in Vancouver over 67 days, {{in and around the}} city's central business district. Most sequences were shot in 3D and ten companies were involved with the extensive visual effects work. <b>Chroma</b> <b>keying</b> and other techniques were used to allow more freedom {{in creating}} effects. Daft Punk composed the musical score, incorporating orchestral sounds with their trademark electronic music.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene that}} {{features}} Scully applying a yellow powder to the invisible body of Anson Stokes {{made use of}} various digital techniques. The first shot of the scene used a blue head cast of Kevin Weisman, the actor who portrayed Stokes. Gillian Anderson then added the yellow dust onto the cast. The second shot used motion control in order to match the film up exactly. Anderson then attempted to match her movements so that, when the two strips of film were combined, they would {{create the illusion of}} one complete scene. Finally, various close-ups of the blue head cast were filmed, with the blue color being removed via <b>chroma</b> <b>keying.</b> Paul Rabwin later called the scene [...] "very effective." ...|$|E
40|$|Video editing {{software}} {{can be used}} to combine different videos into one video using the <b>chroma</b> <b>key</b> feature. However, detecting such video manipulation is an understudied topic. Digital forgers may present a manipulated video from <b>chroma</b> <b>key</b> composition as evidence in court, thus creating a severe problem. In this paper, we propose a blind detection technique designed to analyze the statistical correlation of blurring artifact extracted from a digital video. This technique allows us to detect <b>chroma</b> <b>key</b> forgery in a manipulated composite video. Findings from our experiments demonstrate that the proposed detection technique can adequately determine the presence of manipulation on a video using <b>chroma</b> <b>key,</b> with a true positive detection rate of 91. 12 % and a false positive detection rate of 1. 95 %...|$|R

500|$|The {{elaborate}} The Brady Bunch house set {{featured in}} the episode was built completely by the production crew, according to series co-star Gillian Anderson. She recounts the fact that, due to the original set having been long ago disassembled, people came [...] "from all over Los Angeles" [...] to get their pictures taken on the set. Anderson, who was a fan of popular sitcoms made by Sherwood Schwartz, like Gilligan's Island and The Brady Bunch, called the experience [...] "wild". The scene wherein Fogelman's house turns into an outside field was created via the technique of <b>Chroma</b> <b>Keying.</b> A shot of both The Brady Bunch house and an outside field were filmed. Then, the actors were filmed against a blue screen. A matte of the scenes was then cut and the scenes were composited against each other. Due {{to the fact that}} the shot was an extended scene, Paul Rabwin later noted that the effects were [...] "a little tricky" [...] to get right; Rabwin noted that the shots' mattes had to cover the [...] "little strands of hair" [...] on Anderson's head, because missing the strands is what [...] "gives [...] away".|$|E
500|$|It {{took two}} years and ten {{companies}} to create the 1,565 visual effects shots of Tron: Legacy. The majority of the effects were done by Digital Domain, who created 882 shots under supervisor Eric Barba. The production team blended several special effect techniques, such as <b>chroma</b> <b>keying,</b> to allow more freedom in creating effects. Similar to Tron, this approach was seen as pushing the boundaries of modern technology. [...] "I was going more on instinct rather than experience," [...] Kosinski remarked. Although he had previously used the technology in producing advertisements, {{this was the first}} time Kosinski used it a large scale simultaneously. Darren Gilford was approached as the production designer, while David Levy was hired as a concept artist. Levy translated Kosinski's ideas into drawings and other visual designs. [...] "Joe's vision evolved the visuals of the first film," [...] he stated. [...] "He wanted the Grid to feel like reality, but with a twist." [...] An estimated twenty to twenty-five artists from the art department developed concepts of the Tron: Legacy universe, which varied from real world locations to fully digital sets. Gilford suggested that there were between sixty and seventy settings in the film, split up into fifteen fully constructed sets with different levels of computer-created landscapes.|$|E
2500|$|The museum {{occupies}} a site originally proposed for a theatre in central Bradford, for which work {{begun in the}} 1960s remained unfinished. [...] Resulting from discussions between Dame Margaret Weston of the Science Museum, London and Bradford city councillors, the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, {{as it was then}} called, opened on 16 June 1983. [...] The museum launched Britain’s largest cinema screen, IMAX, five storeys high with six-channel sound, on the same day. [...] During this period the museum specialised in the art and science of images and image-making since Colin Ford, its first director, believed that understanding how images are made led to appreciation of the ideas expressed and the intentions and skills of image-makers. [...] To mark the 50th anniversary of the first public television service, two interactive television galleries were developed in 1986. These allowed visitors to operate cameras on a studio set with programmed sound and lighting, use vision mixers, read a news item from an autocue and discover how <b>chroma</b> <b>keying</b> works.|$|E

2500|$|The {{continuing}} {{popularity of}} Star Wars and other science fiction franchises were relevant in cinematic CGI at this time, as Lucasfilm and Industrial Light & Magic {{became known as}} the [...] "go-to" [...] house by many other studios for topnotch computer graphics in film. Important advances in <b>chroma</b> <b>keying</b> ("bluescreening", etc.) were made for the later films of the original trilogy. Two other pieces of video would also outlast the era as historically relevant: Dire Straits' iconic, near-fully-CGI video for their song [...] "Money For Nothing" [...] in 1985, which popularized CGI among music fans of that era, and a scene from Young Sherlock Holmes the same year featuring the first fully CGI character in a feature movie (an animated stained-glass knight). In 1988, the first shaders - small programs designed specifically to do shading as a separate algorithm - were developed by Pixar, which had already spun off from Industrial Light & Magic as a separate entity - though the public would not see the results of such technological progress until the next decade. In the late 1980s, SGI computers were used to create some of the first fully computer-generated short films at Pixar, and Silicon Graphics machines were considered a high-water mark for the field during the decade.|$|E

5000|$|Chroma key compositing, or <b>chroma</b> <b>keying,</b> is {{a visual}} effects / {{post-production}} technique for compositing (layering) two images or video streams together based on color hues (chroma range). The technique {{has been used}} heavily in many fields to remove a [...] from {{the subject of a}} photo or video - particularly the newscasting, motion picture and videogame industries. A color range in the foreground footage is made transparent, allowing separately filmed background footage or a static image to be inserted into the scene. The <b>chroma</b> <b>keying</b> technique is commonly used in video production and post-production. This technique is also referred to as color keying, colour-separation overlay (CSO; primarily by the BBC), or by various terms for specific color-related variants such as green screen, and blue screen - <b>chroma</b> <b>keying</b> can be done with backgrounds of any color that are uniform and distinct, but green and blue backgrounds are more commonly used because they differ most distinctly in hue from most human skin colors. No part of the subject being filmed or photographed may duplicate the color used as the backing.|$|E
