A child that has been screened with the GSEGC and displays significant developmental delay will then proceed to this step. In this process, a single <b>clinician</b> <b>or</b> <b>clinicians</b> of multiple disciplines (i.e. pediatrics, speech therapy, occupational therapy, psychology, etc.) must spend {{a significant amount of}} time observing a child. Specifically, the clinician(s) must be able to characterize how {{the degree to which a}} child is able to interact with others as it relates to developmental level.|$|R

50|$|As {{in other}} aspects of applied ethics, {{different}} approaches {{may be used to}} understand these problems; they may be seen in terms of the rights and duties involved in medical practice, or how to maximise the good through the work <b>clinicians</b> do, <b>or</b> in terms of the virtues needed to flourish as a <b>clinician</b> <b>or</b> a patient. Deciding which moral framework to apply brings primary care ethics into contact with meta-ethics and epistemology. There is increasing interest in the empirical study of primary care ethics, often using qualitative research methods, which raises important metaethical and methodological questions about the relationship between facts and values.|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{comprehensive}} review of structured family support programs in children’s mental health was con-ducted in collaboration with leadership from key national family organizations. The goals were to identify typologies of family support services for which evaluation data exis-ted and identify research gaps. Over 200 programs were examined; 50 met criteria for inclusion. Programs were categorized by whether they were delivered by peer family members, <b>clinicians,</b> <b>or</b> teams. Five salient components of family support were identified: (a) informational, (b) instructional, (c) emotional, (d) instrumental, and (e) advocacy. Clinician-led programs were heavily represented (n = 33, 66 %), followed by family-led (n = 11, 22 %), and team-delivered (n = 6, 12 %) programs. Key differences between programs delivered by <b>clinicians</b> <b>or</b> by peer family members {{were found in the}} degree of emphasis, research methodology, and outcomes. However, the content of the components was similar across all three program types. There are both important differences in emphasis across typologies of family support provided by <b>clinicians,</b> family members, <b>or</b> teams as well as important similarities in content. Family-delivered support may be an important adjunct to existing services for parents, although the research base remains thin. A research agenda to promote more rigorous evaluations of these services especially those delivered by peer family members is critical...|$|R
30|$|It is {{important}} for multisite collaborations that involve simultaneous collation of assessments to have efficient procedures for data capture that do not overburden <b>clinicians</b> <b>or</b> researchers but that maximise the likelihood of complete and accurate data entry. To help in this process, a specific case report form was produced, incorporating all {{the items in the}} standardised assessment package which was then translated into the languages of participating countries for local use.|$|R
40|$|Focused ethnographies {{can have}} {{meaningful}} application in primary, community, or hospital healthcare. They can be pragmatic and efficient ways to investigate specific phenomena important to individual <b>clinicians</b> <b>or</b> clinical specialities.

This paper defines focused ethnographies, locates them within the ethnographic genre, justifies their use in healthcare research, and outlines the methodological processes...|$|R
50|$|The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is {{a rating}} scale which a <b>clinician</b> <b>or</b> {{researcher}} may use to measure psychiatric {{symptoms such as}} depression, anxiety, hallucinations and unusual behaviour.

The scale {{is one of the}} oldest, most widely used scales to measure psychotic symptoms and was first published in 1962.|$|R

30|$|A {{wealth of}} {{information}} on genomics is rapidly being acquired {{with the potential for}} a major impact on human health. However, these data are scattered through multiple scientific journals, reviews and state-sponsored reports and bulletins. A <b>clinician</b> <b>or</b> health professional often has difficulty in accessing and assimilating this information for application in medical and public health practice. More importantly, an inability to assimilate and interpret leads to frustration and avoidance of potentially useful information.|$|R
50|$|The <b>clinician</b> <b>or</b> {{researcher}} {{should be}} present in the room with the test-taker to prevent the subject from asking others how they should answer the question. Additionally, the administrator should only answer questions regarding the test in a non-committal fashion, reiterating that the subject may complete the stem however he or she wishes. This may even include fragmentary or non-responses, which Loevinger asserts are still of importance and must be rated as any other response.|$|R
50|$|The Ben Kean Medal is {{an honor}} awarded by the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene to a <b>clinician</b> <b>or</b> {{educator}} who impacts the people around them with the same traditions that Ben Kean first proposed.

40|$|In {{situations}} where completing a full intellectual assessment {{is not possible}} <b>or</b> desirable the <b>clinician</b> <b>or</b> researcher may require an alternative means of accurately estimating intellectual functioning. There has been limited research {{in the use of}} proxy IQ measures in children with an intellectual disability or low IQ. The present study aimed to provide a means of converting total scores from a screening tool (the Child and Adolescent Intellectual Disability Screening Questionnaire: CAIDS-Q) to an estimated IQ. A series of linear regression analyses were conducted on data from 428 children and young people referred to clinical services, where FSIQ was predicted from CAIDS-Q total scores. Analyses were conducted for three age groups between ages 6 and 18 years. The study presents a conversion table for converting CAIDS-Q total scores to estimates of FSIQ, with corresponding 95 % prediction intervals to allow the <b>clinician</b> <b>or</b> researcher to estimate FSIQ scores from CAIDS-Q total scores. It is emphasised that, while this conversion may offer a quick means of estimating intellectual functioning in children with a below average IQ, it should be used with caution, especially in children aged between 6 and 8 years old...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} <b>clinicians</b> <b>or</b> other users to retrieve and query contextual information of inpatients, ontology technology is used to integrate data and annotate the connotation of related concepts and properties. The quantitative model based on the RF algorithm is manually transformed into several rules in Jena format, and the Jena inference API is utilized to create an inference model for obtaining the quantitative results. Eventually, an exemplary application named quantitative analysis for depression mood status and knowledge sharing is actualized.|$|R

Generalists are individuals who are responsible for managing or helping to manage an entire facility. Specialists are individuals who are responsible for the efficient operations of a specific department such as policy analysis, finance, accounting, budgeting, human resources, or marketing.|$|R
