40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative {{bacterium}} that causes hospital-acquired infections. P. aeruginosa has {{a multitude of}} defense mechanisms that limit the effectiveness of antibiotics to combat the bacterium. A large number of antibiotics were developed over the 20 th century, but overuse has helped contribute {{to the rise of}} antibiotic resistance. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has categorized P. aeruginosa as a “serious” threat among the top eighteen antibiotic-resistance bacterial threats identified in the US. Cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAPs), including colistin and polymyxin B, are currently utilized as last resort treatments for infections with multidrug-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa. Alarmingly, CAP-resistant strains of the bacterium have been encountered. Resistance occurs with the up regulation of the arnBCADTEF operon, leading to the modification of the outer membrane. This modification decreases the net negative charge on the outer membrane, which in turn lowers the affinity for the <b>CAPs,</b> <b>blocking</b> their entry into the cell. We are targeting inhibition of the first committed step of the pathway, catalyzed by ArnA. Successful inhibition of this enzyme with a small molecule will render the pathway nonfunctional, preventing outer membrane modification. The bacteria will thus remain susceptible to colistin, and a combination therapy of the ArnA inhibitor and colistin could be utilized against resistant strains...|$|R
40|$|Cyclase-associated protein (CAP), {{also called}} Srv 2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a conserved actin monomer-binding protein that {{promotes}} cofilin-dependent actin turnover in vitro and in vivo. However, {{little is known}} about the mechanism underlying this function. Here, we show that S. cerevisiae CAP binds with strong preference to ADP-G-actin (Kd 0. 02 μM) compared with ATP-G-actin (Kd 1. 9 μM) and competes directly with cofilin for binding ADP-G-actin. Further, <b>CAP</b> <b>blocks</b> actin monomer addition specifically to barbed ends of filaments, in contrast to profilin, which blocks monomer addition to pointed ends of filaments. The actin-binding domain of CAP is more extensive than previously suggested and includes a recently solved β-sheet structure in the C-terminus of CAP and adjacent sequences. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we define evolutionarily conserved residues that mediate binding to ADP-G-actin and demonstrate that these activities are required for CAP function in vivo in directing actin organization and polarized cell growth. Together, our data suggest that in vivo CAP competes with cofilin for binding ADP-actin monomers, allows rapid nucleotide exchange to occur on actin, and then because of its 100 -fold weaker binding affinity for ATP-actin compared with ADP-actin, allows other cellular factors such as profilin to take the handoff of ATP-actin and facilitate barbed end assembly...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that {{an increase in}} intracellular Ca 2 + is both necessary and sufficient to commit ectoderm to a neural fate in Xenopus embryos. However, the relationship between this Ca 2 + increase and the expression of early neural genes {{has yet to be}} defined. Using a subtractive cDNA library between untreated and caffeine-treated animal caps, i. e., control ectoderm and ectoderm induced toward a neural fate by a release of Ca 2 +, we have isolated the arginine N-methyltransferase, xPRMT 1 b, a Ca 2 +-induced target gene, which plays a pivotal role in this process. First, we show in embryo and in animal cap that xPRMT 1 b expression is Ca 2 +-regulated. Second, overexpression of xPRMT 1 b induces the expression of early neural genes such as Zic 3. Finally, in the whole embryo, antisense approach with morpholino oligonucleotide against xPRMT 1 b impairs neural development and in animal <b>caps</b> <b>blocks</b> the expression of neural markers induced by a release of internal Ca 2 +.

40|$|The {{basement}} membrane (BM) represents {{a barrier to}} cell migration, which has to be degraded to promote invasion. However, the role and behaviour of the BM during the development of pre-invasive cells is only poorly understood. Drosophila border cells (BCs) provide an attractive genetic model in which to study the cellular mechanisms underlying the migration of mixed cohorts of epithelial cells. BCs are made of two different epithelial cell types appearing sequentially during oogenesis: the polar cells and the outer BCs. Here, we show that the pre-invasive polar cells undergo an unusual and asymmetrical apical capping with major {{basement membrane}} proteins, including the two Drosophila Collagen IV alpha chains, Laminin A and Perlecan. Capping of polar cells proceeds through a novel, basal-to-apical transcytosis mechanism that involves the small GTPase Drab 5. Apical capping is transient and is followed by rapid shedding prior to the initiation of BC migration, suggesting that the apical <b>cap</b> <b>blocks</b> migration. Consistently, non-migratory polar cells remain capped. We further show that JAK/STAT signalling and recruitment of outer BCs are required for correct shedding and migration. The dynamics of the BM represents a marker of migratory BC, revealing a novel developmentally regulated behaviour of BM coupled to epithelial cell invasiveness...|$|R

40|$|In this report, we {{have used}} mRNA {{injection}} to study the action of mutants of XrelA, a Xenopus homolog of the RelA (p 65) component of NF-kappa B, on the induction of mesoderm in Xenopus embryos. A region of the res homology domain of XrelA was deleted to create XrelA Delta SP, which retains the dimerization and activation domains, but no longer binds to DNA, We also made an analogous derivative of mammalian NF-kappa B 1 (p 50), We show that both constructs have dominant inhibitory activity. When message encoding ei;ther is injected into eggs or oocytes, DNA binding of rel family members is suppressed, as is transactivation of a kappa B-dependent promoter in embryos. Expression of XrelA Delta SP in animal <b>caps</b> <b>blocks</b> the induction of mesoderm by bFGF. In addition, this mutant prevents elongation movements generated by activin, but has little effect on posterior dorsal cytodifferentiation, which in marked contrast is blocked by inhibition of the FGF signal transduction pathway between the receptor and MAP kinase, The specificity of the XrelA Delta SP effect on FGF signaling is shown by rescue of mesodermal marker expression when XrelA Delta SP is coexpressed with a specific rel inhibitor. The target of these dominant negative constructs seems to be neither XrelA itself, nor p 50, but rather some other molecule with which XrelA, rather than NF-kappa B 1, heterodimerizes. We show that XrelA Delta SP blocks FGF induction of mesoderm downstream of MAP kinase and Xbra expression. Thus it prevents the maintenance of Xbra expression by inhibiting its autoregulation by embryonic FGF (eFGF). We suggest that XrelA Delta SP differs from other reported inhibitors of FGF signaling because it inhibits only gastrula stage FGF signaling and not the maternally programmed signaling at the blastula stage, Our results therefore suggest that zygotic FGF action is required for cell movements rather than dorsal differentiation...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In syncytial {{blastoderm}} Drosophila embryos, actin caps assemble during telophase. As {{the cell}} cycle progresses through interphase, these small caps expand and fuse to form pseudocleavage furrows that are structurally {{related to the}} cleavage furrows that assemble during somatic cell division. The molecular mechanism driving cell cycle coordinated actin reorganization from the caps to the furrows is not understood. RESULTS: We show that Drosophila embryos contain a typical Arp 2 / 3 complex and that components of this complex localize to {{the margins of the}} expanding caps, to mature pseudocleavage furrows, and to somatic cell cleavage furrows during the postcellularization embryonic divisions. A mutation that disrupts the arpc 1 subunit of Arp 2 / 3 leads to spindle fusions that are characteristic of pseudocleavage furrow disruption. By contrast, this mutation does not significantly affect nuclear positioning during interphase, which is dependent on actin cap function. In vivo analysis of actin reorganization demonstrates that the arpc 1 mutation does not prevent assembly of small actin <b>caps</b> but <b>blocks</b> <b>cap</b> expansion and furrow assembly as the cell cycle progresses through interphase. The scrambled gene is also required for cap expansion and furrow assembly, and Scrambled is required for Arp 2 / 3 localization to the cap margins. CONCLUSIONS: The Drosophila Arp 2 / 3 complex and Scrambled protein are required for actin cap expansion and pseudocleavage furrow formation during the syncytial blastoderm divisions. We propose that Scrambled-dependent localization of Arp 2 / 3 to the margins of the expanding caps triggers local actin polymerization that drives cap expansion and pseudocleavage furrow assembly...|$|R
40|$|As {{pretreatment}} with intraperitoneal capsaicin (8 -methyl-N-vanillyl- 6 -nonenamide, CAP), an agonist of the vanilloid receptor {{known as}} VR 1 or transient receptor potential channel-vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (TRPV- 1), {{has been shown}} to block the first phase of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) fever in rats, this phase is thought to depend on the TRPV- 1 -bearing sensory nerve fibers originating in the abdominal cavity. However, our recent studies suggest that <b>CAP</b> <b>blocks</b> the first phase via a non-neural mechanism. In the present work, we studied whether this mechanism involves the TRPV- 1. Adult Long–Evans rats implanted with chronic jugular catheters were used. Pretreatment with CAP (5 mg kg− 1, i. p.) 10 days before administration of LPS (10 μg kg− 1, i. v.) resulted in the loss of the entire first phase and a part of the second phase of LPS fever. Pretreatment with the ultrapotent TRPV- 1 agonist resiniferatoxin (RTX; 2, 20, or 200 μg kg− 1, i. p.) 10 days before administration of LPS had no effect on the first and second phases of LPS fever, but it exaggerated the third phase at the highest dose. The latter effect was presumably due to the known ability of high doses of TRPV- 1 agonists to cause a loss of warm sensitivity, thus leading to uncontrolled, hyperpyretic responses. Pretreatment with the selective competitive TRPV- 1 antagonist capsazepine (N-[2 -(4 -chlorophenyl) ethyl]- 1, 3, 4, 5 -tetrahydro- 7, 8 -dihydroxy- 2 H- 2 -benzazepine- 2 -carbothioamidem, CPZ; 40 mg kg− 1, i. p.) 90 min before administration of LPS (10 μg kg− 1, i. v.) or CAP (1 mg kg− 1, i. p.) did not affect LPS fever, but blocked the immediate hypothermic response to acute administration of CAP. It is concluded that LPS fever is initiated via a non-neural mechanism, which is CAP-sensitive but RTX- and CPZ-insensitive. The action of CAP on this mechanism is likely TRPV- 1 -independent. It is speculated that this mechanism may be the production of prostaglandin E 2 by macrophages in LPS-processing organs...|$|R
