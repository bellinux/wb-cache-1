And the influence of friction coefficient on the quality of end-plane and side spread of ring, rolling force, rolling moment and metal flow characteristic in the <b>cold</b> ring <b>rolling</b> process have been explored using the three dimensional (3 D) numerical simulation based on the elastic-plastic dynamic finite element method (FEM) under the ABAQUS software environment, and the results show that increasing the friction on the contact surfaces between rolls and ring blank is useful not only for improving the stability of <b>cold</b> ring <b>rolling</b> but also for improving the geometry and dimension precision of deformed ring.

40|$|SALF {{program is}} a Brazilian program {{developed}} to simulate the <b>cold</b> flat <b>rolling</b> process by the finite element method. The program uses the implicit and rigid-plastic approaches to perform numerical analyses. This article presents the <b>cold</b> flat <b>rolling</b> simulations performed by SALF, where the variables of rolling force, effective strain rate, and effective strain were analyzed.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Cold</b> ring <b>rolling</b> {{is a kind}} of {{advanced}} manufacturing technology. During rolling process the ring may be collapsed or deformed unexpectedly under the pressure of guide roll because the stiffness condition is not met. The force of guide roll to ring was obtained by analyzing the forces to ring. The stiffness condition expressions of ring during rolling were shown after constructing the mechanical model. According to the expressions, the effects of several parameters on the stiffness condition were discussed and analyzed in detail, such as position angle of guide roll, friction coefficient and feed rate, etc, which revealed essential reasons of some cases occurring in <b>cold</b> ring <b>rolling.</b> Then the ring blank dimension was deduced based on the ring stiffness condition. The dimensions of ring blank should meet a relationship to ensure the ring stiffness condition to be satisfied during rolling, which can conduct the practical manufacturing effectively. Finally the analysis and effect laws were proved by finite element simulation experiments. The researches could be helpful to control parameter in <b>cold</b> ring <b>rolling</b> effectively for high quality products...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Guide rolls play an {{important}} role in controlling both the ring circularity and the stability of <b>cold</b> ring <b>rolling</b> process. However, it is difficult to predict and control the motion of the guide rolls due to the complexity of process associated with the coupled effects of multi-factors. In this paper, a reasonable controlling model of the guide rolls is proposed, and the functional relationship between the motion track of the guide rolls and their setup parameters and process ones is established, by which the guide rolls motion track can be determined. On this basis, a 3 D-FE simulation model for <b>cold</b> ring <b>rolling</b> is developed under the ABAQUS software environment and the effects of the initial position and motion track of the guide rolls on the forming stability, ring circularity, rolling force, and oscillating are investigated. Taking the forming stability and ring circularity as objects, the optimum initial position and motion track of the guide rolls are obtained...|$|R
40|$|Friction is {{the reason}} for the process of rolling to {{actually}} take place, and it {{plays an important role in}} determining the rolling mechanics and deformation distributions of the strip. At the interface between the roll and strip, friction has a significant influence on the dimensional accuracy and strip surface quality. This paper presents the modelling of <b>cold</b> strip <b>rolling</b> taking into account the friction along the strip rolling and transverse directions. A 3 D rigid plastic finite element method considering slightly compressible material, and an influence function method were employed, respectively, to analyse the <b>cold</b> strip <b>rolling,</b> and simulation results show that the friction in both directions has a significant effect on the rolling mechanics, strip shape and profile. Variation of the transverse friction affects the strip edge drop, but the friction variation along the rolling direction may affect the central and edge buckles of the strip. The calculated rolling forces are in good agreement with the measured values...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the development of}} microstructure and texture during <b>cold</b> ring <b>rolling</b> of 100 Cr 6 steel rings with starting rectangular cross-sections. By interrupting the rolling process at pre-defined intervals expansion ratios ranging from 1. 05 to 1. 5 were achieved resulting in varying degrees of deformation of the rings. Results for rings with a simple rectangular cross-section were compared with results for a cold rolled ring with a more complex cross-section. By combining results from optical and scanning electron microscopy with hardness measurements the two different ring shapes were shown to display similar material flow during <b>cold</b> ring <b>rolling.</b> The deformation was most severe near the inner diameter of the rings decreasing towards {{the area of the}} outer diameter. By employing electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) the ring rolling process was shown to change the { 111 }-fibre texture of the ring blanks to a { 110 } texture.
