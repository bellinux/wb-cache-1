Relevance of the selected issue {{is due to the}} fact that often a criminal crime, administrative and disciplinary offences are similar, and that?s why in some cases one type of legal liability without any reason is substituted by another one. In this regard, there is an increasing rate of people who are illegally brought to criminal, administrative and disciplinary liability through the shortcomings of the relevant legislation and the failure to distinguish one type of legal liability from another. There is a question how disciplinary guilt is different from a crime and administrative offence. The answer is of fundamental practical and theoretical importance. Based on the analysis of special literature and existing scientific research the author has made a comparative analysis of the characteristics and differences of various types of legal liability. Disciplinary liability is different from other types of legal liability according to the legal consequences of the offence. <b>Disciplinary</b> <b>sanctions</b> are different from criminal punishments, not only by the level of severity, a criminal record, but the way of setting. Disciplinary law, unlike the criminal one, does not carry out the distribution of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>sanctions</b> on the basic and additional. Nurturing, not punishment determines socio-legal content of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>sanctions</b> and distinguishes them from criminal and administrative penalties. <b>Disciplinary</b> <b>sanctions</b> and criminal penalties by the socio-legal content vary by the speed of their application to the offender. Procedural forms {{of disciplinary}} proceedings differ from procedural forms of other types of liability. Disciplinary liability differs from administrative one by the grounds, legal consequences of an offense, subjects of liability and other features. <b>Disciplinary</b> <b>sanctions</b> differ from administrative ones by the ways of their setting by the state.
