5|$|In 2005, 270 {{sales were}} {{necessary}} to attain break-even and with 751 expected deliveries its Internal rate of return outlook was at 19%, but due to disruptions in the ramp-up leading to overcosts and delayed deliveries, it increased to 420 in 2006. In 2010, EADS CFO Hans Peter Ring said that break-even could be achieved by 2015 when 200 deliveries were projected. In 2012, Airbus clarified that the aircraft production <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> less than its sales price.|$|E
5|$|As {{both the}} other {{alternatives}} were discarded, consensus gradually grew for the Flåm alternative, and the Railway Committee for Nordre Bergenhus County recommended this proposal. New plans from NSB criticized {{the mix of}} rack and adhesion railway, and instead proposed a conventional adhesion line all the way. Engineer Ferdinand Bjerke traveled to Continental Europe to study several combined railways. He published a preliminary report in 1911, which recommended an adhesion railway, although he also felt {{the need for a}} detailed study of a rack railway. His final report was finished in 1913, and although it recommended adhesion, it pointed out that the line's capacity would be smaller than predicted and that <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> three times as high—NOK5.5 million. The plans were approved by the Ministry of Labour and NSB's main board in 1915.|$|E

30|$|In {{monetary}} terms, we {{can take}} the polar cases of Germany and the UK. Suppose that we equate the marginal cost of the market to 10, 000 euros, the per-refugee compensation given by the Asylum and Migration Fund. The total cost, both under the existing pledges and under the market, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> equal to 40, 137 pledges times 10, 000 euros, that is 201 million euros. Under {{the current system of}} pledges, Germany’s <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> equal to 150 million while the UK’s <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> limited to 715, 000 euros.

5|$|At the time, the {{government}} was spending NOK 1.4 billion annually on purchasing passenger transport from NSB. By introducing PSO, Skogsholm stated that she hoped the <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> reduced, and that quality and safety levels would remain, or even improve. The counties {{have been allowed to}} issue PSO contracts on bus transport since 1994; and Skogsholm saw the competition in rail transport as a continuation of this. Following the announcement of the competition, CEO of NSB, Einar Enger, said that he did not see competition as a threat, but instead that NSB would introduce means to rationalize costs. In November 2002, NSB laid off 100 employees, and reduced its administration by a third. The administration of all local and regional trains was reallocated to Oslo. Skogsholm stated that {{the government}} had no plans to sell NSB.|$|E
5|$|On June 20, Jaws opened across North America on 464 screens—409 in the United States, the {{remainder}} in Canada. The coupling of this broad distribution pattern with the movie's then even rarer national television marketing campaign yielded a release method virtually unheard-of at the time. (A month earlier, Columbia Pictures {{had done something}} similar with a Charles Bronson thriller, Breakout, though that film's prospects for an extended run were much slimmer.) Universal president Sid Sheinberg reasoned that nationwide marketing <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> amortized at a more favorable rate per print relative to a slow, scaled release. Building on the film's success, the release was subsequently expanded on July 25 to nearly 700 theaters, and on August 15 to more than 950. Overseas distribution followed the same pattern, with intensive television campaigns and wide releases—in Great Britain, for instance, Jaws opened in December at more than 100 theaters.|$|E
5|$|Until 1918, the {{majority}} of the primary roads through southern Ontario formed part of the County Road System. The Department of Public Works and Highways paid up to 60% of the construction and maintenance costs for these roads, while the counties were responsible for the remaining 40%. In 1919, the federal government passed the Canada Highways Act, which provided $20,000,000 to provinces under the condition that they establish an official highway network; up to 40% of construction <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> subsidized. The first network plan was approved on February26, 1920, and included the Talbot Road. The majority of what would soon become Highway3 was designated several months later in August.|$|E

5000|$|According to research, substituting all coal {{consumption}} for {{residential and commercial}} use to natural gas requires additional 88 billion cubic meters of natural gas, which is 60% of China's total consumption in 2012, and the net <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> 32-52 billion dollars. Substituting the share of coal-fired power plant with renewable and nuclear energy also requires 700GW additional capacity, which cost 184 billion dollars. So the net <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> 140-160 billion dollars considering value of saved coal. Since all the above policies have been already partially implemented by national and city governments, they should lead to substantial improvements in urban air quality.|$|R
50|$|Design and {{engineering}} for the station cost $25 million; the MBTA estimated the construction <b>cost</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> $91 million. The primary construction contract was for $82 million, and total construction cost was $88 million.|$|R
5|$|New York voters {{passed a}} {{transportation}} bond issue on November 8, 2005, allowing for dedicated funding allocated for that phase. Its passage {{had been seen}} as critical to its construction, but the bond was passed only by a narrow margin, with 55 percent of voters approving and 45 percent disapproving. At the time, the MTA said that the project would be done in 2012 in case the city's 2012 Summer Olympics bid succeeded, which it had not. On December 18, 2006, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) announced that they would allow the MTA to commit up to $693 million in funds to begin construction of the Second Avenue Subway and that the federal share of such <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> reimbursed with FTA transit funds, subject to appropriations and final labor certification. The USDOT also later gave $1.3 billion in federal funding for the project's first phase, to be funded over a seven-year period.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{assertions that}} speculators {{are making the}} Greek crisis worse, Germany's market {{regulator}} BaFin found no proof supporting the claim.

25|$|The Executive Council {{approved}} Tramways' plan {{to relocate}} its depots to Sai Wan Ho and Sai Ying Pun in July 1986, on {{the argument that}} the HK$3.5million in operating <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> saved. The company promised that tram fares would be unchanged until the end of 1988. The old Sharp Street tram depot was decommissioned in 1988, and the Times Square commercial complex was constructed on the site.|$|E

25|$|According to the law, a tariff {{reflecting}} {{generation and}} transmission <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the regulated power price for distributors. The tariff, {{to be published}} in the official Gazette in order to become effective, had to be calculated yearly by the generators and approved by the regulator, who would also decide on any subsequent adjustments to it. However, ENEE has failed to apply this 1994 Law’s provision for the calculation and implementation of cost-covering tariffs and of focalized subsidies.|$|E
25|$|Coleridge at {{this time}} envisioned the {{community}} including “twelve men with their families,” among whom the <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> split, with the wealthier {{members of the community}} making up for the shortcomings of the poorer members. Besides money, other practical issues arose. Having little ability in farming or carpentry, the young men planned to acquire these skills over the winter in time for a March departure. Among the families who were planning to make the voyage were children, and Coleridge worried that they might already be deeply prejudiced by society, which could subvert and corrupt the Pantisocracy.|$|E

25|$|On February 13, 2014 the Lake Elsinore Unified School District Board of Trustees {{voted to}} hire an {{architectural}} firm and construction company for the rebuilding of Butterfield. It was expected that some primary grades {{would return to the}} rebuilt campus by the fall of 2015, and the remainder of students up through 6th grade would return for the 2016/17 school year. However, after investigation by the planning and architectural firms, it was decided that reconstruction <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> too high to deal with possible seismic refits and the plan to reopen the school has been cancelled. The idea of a Butterfield Renaissance appears to now be dead.|$|E
25|$|SAS {{planned to}} use Stavanger Airport, Sola as its hub, {{providing}} feeder traffic to the capital cities. Stavanger was in part chosen because it had the only suitable runway. Reports from Boeing showed that the maintenance <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very high for the aircraft, and SAS decided {{that it would be}} cheaper to contract with British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), which had also ordered the Stratocruiser, to perform maintenance. When {{it became clear that the}} aircraft would not be delivered until 1950, SAS started negotiations to sell them, and reached an agreement with BOAC to purchase the aircraft for the same cost as SAS had paid.|$|E
25|$|The {{current price}} of CFLs {{reflects}} the manufacturing {{of nearly all}} CFLs in China, where labour costs less. In September 2010, the Winchester, Virginia, General Electric plant closed, leaving Osram Sylvania and the tiny American Light Bulb Manufacturing Inc. the last companies to make standard incandescent bulbs in the United States. At that time, Ellis Yan, whose Chinese company made the majority of CFLs sold in the United States, said {{he was interested in}} building a United States factory to make CFL bulbs, but wanted $12.5 million from the U.S. government to do so. General Electric had considered changing one of its bulb plants to make CFLs, but said that even after a $40 million investment in converting a plant, wage differences would mean <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> 50% higher.|$|E

25|$|In case of {{a nuclear}} accident, should claims exceed this primary liability, the PAA {{requires}} all licensees to additionally provide a maximum of $95.8 million into the accident pool - totaling roughly $10 billion if all reactors were required to pay the maximum. This is still not sufficient in the {{case of a}} serious accident, as the cost of damages could exceed $10 billion. According to the PAA, should the costs of accident damages exceed the $10 billion pool, the process for covering the remainder of the <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> defined by Congress. In 1982, a Sandia National Laboratories study concluded that depending on the reactor size and 'unfavorable conditions' a serious nuclear accident could lead to property damages as high as $314 billion while fatalities could reach 50,000.|$|E
25|$|A {{demand for}} control {{of this process is}} based on the {{principle}} of caution and effective control measures are regarded as necessary. However this faces problems that are not negligible. To separate the “pure” dingo from other domestic dogs is difficult, if it is possible at all. The <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> enormous, and even if all hybrids are destroyed, there are currently no methods to tests the dingoes in the field. Furthermore, control measures usually do not discriminate between dingoes and other domestic dogs. According to the biologist David Jenkins from the Australian National University there is little {{that can be done to}} reverse the process of interbreeding. Even if selectively searching for hybrids during the killings, it would only disrupt the pack structure and therefore affect the breeding rate of the dogs.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this was}} during {{an era of}} rapid shifts within the {{aviation}} industry. The winding-down of major purchases to feed the Vietnam War and Project Apollo was forcing the major aerospace firms to seek ways to diversify, and the government was actively funding a number of mass transit projects in partnership with them. Rivers changed the focus to be a show about any form of transit, not just aircraft, and the size and cost started to increase. He won an initial appropriation of $3 million for the show, but {{had to return to}} Congress for another $2 million to keep it on track as its scale rapidly increased. Critics, notably William Proxmire, attacked the event and claimed that the actual <b>costs</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> closer to $10 million when industry input was considered.|$|E
