50|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>stearoyl-2-lactylate</b> is a food {{additive}} that {{is found}} in many food products, such as baked goods, desserts, powdered drink mixes, dehydrated potatoes, and chewing gums. In Canada, {{it is commonly used}} in yeast-leavened recipes as an emulsifier during bread making. In bread, <b>calcium</b> <b>stearoyl-2-lactylate</b> helps to improve the mixability of the dough and strengthen it. It also improves bread’s grain and texture, as well as the volume of the final loaf.|$|E
50|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>stearoyl-2-lactylate</b> (calcium stearoyl lactylate or CSL) is a versatile, FDA {{approved}} food additive. CSL is non-toxic, biodegradable, {{and typically}} manufactured using biorenewable feedstocks. Because CSL {{is a safe}} and highly effective food additive, it is used {{in a wide variety}} of products from baked goods and desserts to packaging.|$|E

50|$|Compared to <b>calcium</b> <b>stearoyl-2-lactylate</b> (CSL), SSL {{offers some}} advantages. First, SSL disperses and {{hydrates}} more readily in water than CSL. Therefore, SSL {{does not require}} pre-hydration. Second, SSL provides better crumb softening than CSL. SSL's crumb softening effect is noticeable up to 5-7 days after baking. Third, in rich bread formulations (e.g. pan bread and hamburger buns), SSL provides better dough strengthening than CSL. Use of SSL in these formulations will yield (nearly) perfect symmetry in the finished baked good. Because of these characteristics, SSL is currently used in more baking applications than CSL.|$|E
50|$|Lactylates {{have been}} {{subjected}} to extensive safety evaluations prior to being FDA approved for use as food additives. The first safety evaluations were initiated by the C.J. Patterson Company in 1950. These biochemical and toxicology studies focused on Verv®, <b>calcium</b> <b>stearoyl-2-lactylate.</b> Data collected from eighteen separate investigations over eleven years were extensively reviewed by physiologists, toxicologists, and statisticians. The results of these studies conclusively demonstrated lactylates to be non-toxic by ingestion leading to FDA approval in April 1961. Research into the safety of lactylates has since continued, with the latest study being completed in 2010. The results of each new study have confirmed the safety of lactylates.|$|E
