30|$|An {{overview}} of the characterisation of rock art pigments in locations across Australia has been provided in this paper and has demonstrated the expanding use of modern analytical techniques to the many archaeological and heritage questions that arise from such important sites. Through the successful identification of the chemical composition of complex pigment mixtures questions about the source of materials and how {{and when they were}} applied can be answered. Specifically, links to material sources (local or traded), the origins of special <b>colours,</b> <b>preparation</b> methods and method of application, the sequencing of painting from stratified paint layers, and the weathering processes to age works have been investigated via a chemical characteristion of rock art materials.|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{performed}} analyses of the factors that contributed the infected meat reach food chain, we have found out that the infection occurred after consuming the meat inspected by the method of collective samples artificial digestion by using a magnetic stirrer (MM). In this work there are presented assay results which show how modifications of the method, on the level of final sedimentation, influence the reliability of Trichinella larvas detection in the infected meat samples. It has been shown that use of inadequate laboratory containers for larva collecting in final sedimentation and change of volume of digestive liquid that outflow during <b>colouring</b> <b>preparations,</b> can significantly influence inspection results. Larva detection errors ranged from 4 to 80 % in presented the experimental groups in regard to the control group of samples inspected by using MM method, which had been carried out completely according to Europe Commission procedure No 2075 / 2005, where no errors in larva number per sample was found. We consider that the results of this work will contribute to the improvement of control of the method performance and especially of the critical point during inspection of meat samples to Trichinella larvas in Serbia...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{multidisciplinary}} investigation of pigments and artefacts with traces of colour from the Early- Middle Holocene site of Takarkori, {{located in the}} Tadrart Acacus Mountains (central Sahara, SW Libya). Here, geological, archaeological, taphonomic and chemical studies (Raman, Fourier-transform infrared, X-ray powder diffraction, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry) are used to examine a vast range of artefacts (raw materials, grinding stones, painted items, as well as lithic, bone, wooden and ceramic tools) equally distributed from Late Acacus contexts related to hunter-gatherers (ca. 8900 – 7400 uncal years bp) to pastoral groups (ca. 7400 – 4500 uncal years bp). The exploited minerals (goethite, hematite, kaolinite and jarosite, among others) are locally procured and processed using quartzarenite grinding stones of different shapes and sizes. Thermal treatment of the minerals is also suggested by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Raman studies. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses show {{the addition of a}} lipid binder to small lumps of pigments in order to obtain a sticky product. Their fatty acid distribution differs from the residues on grinding stones, pointing to a specific use of these lumps. The grinding stones have also been used to crush and pulverize the pigments and as base for <b>colour</b> <b>preparation.</b> A sample of colour from a fallen painted slab referable to late pastoral phases shows the presence of a binder, chemically identified as casein. Taken together, the evidence collected at Takarkori conveys to suggest an articulated chaîne opératoire, not only directed towards the preparation of pigments for the parietal rock art but also to other non-utilitarian functions, such as body care and ornamentation and decoration of artefacts...|$|R

40|$|For medieval people, colour {{provided}} {{important information}} {{about the nature of}} objects, and that was no less true of what they ate than of anything else. On one level colour might expose moral and spiritual connotations, on another it might offer indications of characteristics of a foodstuff according to medieval humoral theories. Moreover, it was to form an important element in the elite cuisine that developed across Europe from 1200 and perhaps earlier. Display was a crucial part of this cuisine, and this paper demonstrates how and why it was employed, {{and the ways in which}} these culinary practices were emulated elsewhere in society. Recipes instructed cooks in colouring dishes, and in ways of adding verisimilitude to made dishes. Heraldic colours and designs were employed for ‘subtleties’, the set pieces that came to table with wider messages. There were general cultural associations between <b>colours</b> and culinary <b>preparations,</b> and some types of dish show common patterns of colouring. However fleeting the colours of foodstuffs, they offer a further dimension to our understanding of meals, the material culture of dining and medieval mentalities...|$|R
5|$|The battalion's {{personnel}} {{during the}} early stages of its existence were volunteers who enlisted within the 4th Military District, which encompassed South Australia and Broken Hill, New South Wales. Many of the commissioned officers and some of the non-commissioned officers had previous military experience in the Militia, while the bulk of the enlisted personnel had no prior military service. Rudimentary individual soldier training was conducted along with sports meets throughout August, followed by skill-at-arms training and range shoots in September, while key appointment holders were sent away on various promotion and other specialist training courses. In early October, the battalion was presented with its battle flag by veterans who had served in the 43rd Battalion during World War I, and a short time later it was announced that the 24th Brigade would be transferred to join the 9th Division in the Middle East. More intense training, including company and battalion-level field training was conducted in the weeks that followed. In late November, the 2/43rd received their Unit <b>Colour</b> Patches in <b>preparation</b> for deployment and the battalion marched through the centre of Adelaide. Finally, on 28 December 1940, the men entrained at Oakbank, and were transported by rail to Melbourne, where they embarked on the transport Mauretania.|$|R
40|$|A {{purified}} arylesterase preparation from bovine plasma {{was characterized}} {{to the extent}} that it has a partial specific volume of 0. 91 ml/g and an apparent z-average molecular weight of 440000. The relatively large magnitude of the former reflects the presence of phospholipids, cholesterol, triglycerides and β-carotene, the last-named being responsible for the pronounced yellow <b>colour</b> of the <b>preparation.</b> Removal of the lipid material is accompanied by a decrease in the apparent z-average molecular weight to 120000, the size of the smallest species detected by high-speed sedimentation equilibrium being in the vicinity of 70000 daltons: denaturation of the lipid-free preparation with 6 m-guanidine hydrochloride caused essentially complete breakdown into subunits of this size. In kinetic studies on the enzyme the maximal velocity for the hydrolysis of phenyl acetate was found to increase by 60 % on addition of 1 mm-Ca 2 +, with the Km showing a concomitant decrease from 6. 6 to 2. 1 mm. Removal of lipid had no detectable effect on Vmax. or Km in either the presence or the absence of Ca 2 +. It is concluded that the bovine plasma arylesterase preparation is either a lipoprotein or an enzyme–lipoprotein complex with properties very similar to those of the α 1 -lipoprotein or high-density lipoprotein (HDL 2) fraction of serum...|$|R
40|$|Observation on the Effects of Different Methods of Processing Cassava Chips on Chips Damage Due to Insect Attacks during Storage. The {{influence}} of four traditionnal methods of processing cassava chips in the Republic Democratic of Congo has been evaluted regarding damages caused by insect attacks during storage. The methods tested were : chips from peeled, soaked and sun dried cassava, Bas-Congo type, chips from peeled and sun dried cassava, Kasai type, chips from peeled, soaked and smooked cassava, Haut-Congo/Ecuador type and chips from non-peeled, soaked and smooked cassava, Maindombe type. The more important pests are three coleopteras : Sitophilus sp., Tribolium sp. and Rhizoperta dominica. The chips of Kasai type were almost completely destroyed by insects within four months. Those of Bas-Congo type showed a weight loss of about 40 % after six months. Chips of Haut-Congo and Maindombe types are more suitable to storage, loss of 10 % {{but they have}} a dark aspect due to the smoke. They need a further effort to remove the dark <b>colour</b> before meal <b>preparation.</b> Chips of Bas-Congo type are preferred and would be suitable for storage if preventive measures are taken to prevent early infestations and if the duration of storage does not exceed three months...|$|R

40|$|Medicines for the {{treatment}} of rare diseases frequently do not attract the interest of the pharmaceutical industry, and hospital pharmacists are thus often requested by physicians to prepare personalized medicines. Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a rare disease that causes disfiguring lesions named facial angiofibromas. Various topical formulations of rapamycin (= sirolimus) have been proved effective in treating these changes in small case series. The present study provides for the first time characterization of a 0. 1 % rapamycin cream formulation presenting good rapamycin solubilisation. The first step of the formulation is solubilisation of rapamycin in Transcutol®, and the second step is the incorporation of the mixture in an oil-in-water cream. A HPLC stability-indicating method was developed. Rapamycin concentration in the cream was tested by HPLC and confirmed that it remained above 95 % of the initial concentration for at least 85 days, without characteristic degradation peaks. The preparation met European Pharmacopoeia microbial specifications throughout storage in aluminum tubes, including when patient use was simulated. Odour, appearance and <b>colour</b> of the <b>preparation</b> were assessed and no change was evidenced during storage. The rheological properties of the cream also remained stable throughout storage. To conclude, we report preparation of a novel cream formulation presenting satisfactory rapamycin solubilisation for {{the treatment}} of TSC cutaneous manifestations, with stability data. The cream is currently being used by our patients. Efficacy and tolerance will be reported later...|$|R
40|$|The work {{summarizes}} created algorithms for {{formation of}} finite element (FE) mesh which {{is derived from}} bitmap pattern. Process of registration, segmentation and meshing is described in detail. C++ library of STL from Insight Toolkit (ITK) Project together with Visualization Toolkit (VTK) were used for base processing of images. Several methods for appropriate mesh output are discussed. Multiplatform application WOOD 3 D for the task under GNU GPL license was assembled. Several methods of segmentation and mainly different ways of contouring were included. Tetrahedral and rectilinear types of mesh were programmed. Improving of mesh quality in some simple ways is mentioned. Testing and verification of final program on wood anatomy samples of spruce and walnut was realized. Methods of microscopic anatomy samples preparation are depicted. Final utilization of formed mesh in the simple structural analysis was performed. The article discusses main problems in image analysis due to incompatible <b>colour</b> spaces, samples <b>preparation,</b> thresholding and final conversion into finite element mesh. Assembling of mentioned tasks together and evaluation of the application are main original results of the presented work. In presented program two thresholding filters were used. By utilization of ITK two following filters were included. Otsu filter based and binary filter based were used. The most problematic task occurred in a production of wood anatomy samples in the unique light conditions with minimal or zero co­lour space shift and the following appropriate definition of thresholds (corresponding thresholding parameters and connected methods (prefiltering + registration) which influence the continuity and mainly separation of wood anatomy structure. Solution in samples staining is suggested with the following quick image analysis realization. Next original result {{of the work is}} complex fully automated application which offers three types of finite element mesh. Tetrahedral mesh is coded for FE analysis with significant gradients and hexahedral mesh is offered for tasks with low gradients. Modified octree code is introduced for future research of anisotropic combined mesh...|$|R
40|$|This current {{research}} {{is focused on}} the mineralogical and petrographic characterisation of mortar-based materials from Villa San Marco in the ancient Stabiae (modern Castellammare di Stabia, Napoli), an outstanding example of Roman otium villae, and aims at recognising the technology used by the ancient skilled workers. Several analytical techniques were used such as digital videomicroscopy, optical microscopy, digital image analysis, scanning electron microscopy coupled with EDS analysis and Quantitative Powder X-ray Diffraction. A multi-layer technology characterised the plasters; the scratch coat was made with lime mortars mixed with a pozzolanic lightweight aggregate and cocciopesto, required ingredients providing a quick-setting and a better adhesion with the support. As far as the arriccio layer is concerned, the mix-design is a lime mortar with volcanic sand as the aggregate and a minor content of pozzolan and/or cocciopesto to enhance the workability of the mortar in order to correct any error due to the roughness of the scratch coat. The plaster s. s. was the removable support in case of mistakes, and gave a lighter <b>colour</b> to the <b>preparation</b> layer of the frescoes. The last thin layer, prepared with lime mortars and a carbonate aggregate, is characterised by low porosity in order to avoid pigment adsorption. The painting technique was a fresco with encaustication. In contrast, the mortars of the building structures were made with lime added to a pozzolanic aggregate (volcanics and cocciopesto), giving a quick setting during the implementation of the yellow tuff opus reticulatum. The rudera and nuclei of the mosaics were built with abundant volcanic sand and cocciopesto mixed with the lime, producing a more resistant surface, and finally the tesserae were fixed exclusively with lime. The white and black colours of the mosaics were produced by local limestone and tephritic lava. The results permitted an evaluation of the high level of specialization of both the workers and the artists that built and decorated these maritime villas. Moreover, the collected data highlighted the wide potentiality of the materials cropping out in the environs of the Somma-Vesuvius volcanic complex. This research aims at furnishing a useful reference for future restoration action in Villa San Marco and the other Roman villas in this area...|$|R
