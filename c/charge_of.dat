50|$|<b>Charging</b> <b>of</b> {{capacitor}} by {{constant current}} source and by voltage source is different. Linearity is maintained for constant current source <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> capacitor with time, whereas voltage source <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> capacitor is exponential with time. This particular property of constant current source helps for proper signal conditioning with nearly zero reflection from load.|$|R

30|$|As coordinated <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> EVs is a {{large scale}} {{optimization}} problem, many techniques are proposed to improve the calculation speed. In [11], by correcting nodal voltages iteratively, a linear constrained convex quadratic programming <b>of</b> coordinated <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> EVs is built at each iteration. In [12], a sequential non convex quadratic programming for coordinated <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> EVs is proposed. However, both of the above methods belong to heuristic techniques and the simulation results are based on small systems. When applied to large systems, they could not converge or converge very slowly. In [13, 14], aiming at maximizing total <b>charging</b> energy <b>of</b> all EVs, with the inequality constraints of node voltage and thermal loadings of distribution transformer and cables linearized, a linear programming <b>of</b> coordinated <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> EVs is proposed. In [15], aiming at maximizing the revenue of power corporations with the model of distribution network linearized, a mixed integer linear programming <b>of</b> coordinated <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> EVs is proposed. As the relationship between losses of distribution system and <b>charging</b> power <b>of</b> EVs is non-linear, a linear programming is not applicable to coordinated <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> EVs aiming at minimizing distribution system losses.|$|R
