40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the study and {{comparison}} of stress intensity factor solutions for cracks emanating from <b>countersunk</b> holes in a plate subjected to remote tension and bending moments. To explore {{the difference in the}} crack behavior at a straight-shank and <b>countersunk</b> rivet hole, models of holes with different shapes at various ratios of <b>countersunk</b> depth to plate thickness were generated, in which there were two extreme cases of <b>countersunk</b> holes: knife edge hole and straight-shank hole. The stress intensity factor solutions for cracks at the <b>countersunk</b> holes were predicted using the FEM-BEM alternating technique. The FEM-BEM alternating method, which is described in this paper, was verified by carrying out a study of the stress intensity factor for a crack at a straight-shank hole.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} conducted into the damage progression {{and strength of}} bolted joints with fibre-reinforced composite laminates and <b>countersunk</b> fasteners. The main goal of the experimental investigation is to characterise {{the effect of the}} <b>countersink</b> geometry on the load-carrying capacity of single lap joints in comparison to the straight-shank case. The effects of bolt torque, clearance and <b>countersink</b> height ratio on the damage progression and joint strength are also studied. Experimental tests and detailed microscopy studies are conducted on a bearing test specimen with a straight-edged hole, and several single-lap joint configurations with <b>countersunk</b> fasteners. It is found that introduction of the <b>countersunk</b> hole roughly halves the bearing stress, and causes delamination for some configurations. This delamination is primarily located {{at the start of the}} <b>countersink</b> region, though is found to be triggered by other damage mechanisms and has only minor influence on the results. Bolt torque increases the density of through-thickness damage though limits its extension from the hole edge, whilst bolt clearance causes localisation of the damage region. Increasing the ratio of the <b>countersink</b> depth to the laminate thickness reduces the extent of bearing and promotes bending, with a change to net section failure at large ratios...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—An {{investigation}} into the effect of <b>countersunk</b> depth, plate thickness, <b>countersunk</b> angle and plate width on the stress concentration around <b>countersunk</b> hole is carried out {{with the help of}} finite element analysis. The variation of stress concentration with respect to these parameters is studied for three types of loading viz. uniformly distributed load, uniformly varying load and functionally distributed load. The results of the finite element analysis are interpreted and some conclusions are drawn. The distribution of stress concentration around <b>countersunk</b> hole in isotropic plates simply supported at all the edges is found similar and is independent of loading. The maximum stress concentration also occurs at a particular point irrespective of the loading conditions...|$|R

Regardless of the name given to the cutter, the surface being generated may be a conical chamfer (plunging applications) or a beveled corner for the intersection of two planes (traversing applications).|$|E

50|$|Form {{countersink}}ing, {{also known}} as dimpling, is a countersink that is formed into sheet metal to increase {{the strength of a}} structure as the <b>countersinks</b> of multiple pieces nest together. There are two processes for producing formed countersinks: coin dimpling and modified radius dimpling. Such dimples in fairly thick sheet can even be tapped to yield a threaded hardpoint on the sheet without the bother and expense of welding a nut to the sheet. This style of construction is often seen in modern household appliance design, because it allows the product to be lower-priced, and the quality can still be good as long as the sheet is thick enough.|$|E

40|$|Results are {{presented}} for the fracture strengths of several Gr/F p (AS/ 3501 - 5) laminates containing countersunk holes and normal and slant cracks. <b>Countersinks</b> {{are treated as}} effective uniform holes and slant cracks as effective normal cracks. It is shown that the average stress criterion leads to acceptable strength predictions for all cases considered. SCOPE O RIGINALLY INTRODUCED TO explain the hole size effect in laminated com-posites without resorting to inherent flaws and fracture mechanics concepts, the average stress failure criterion was found to result in remarkably good quantita-tive strength predictions for composites containing cutouts [1, 2]. With one excep-tion [3], however, the applications of this failure criterion to date have been for circular holes or cracks oriented normal to an applied uniaxial tensile load [1, 2, 4]. Thus, the effects on failure predictions of substantial combined stresses and mixed-mode fracture have not been thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, no applications of the average stress criterion appear to exist for failure predictions of notched laminates subjected to compressive loadings...|$|E

40|$|Single-lap, carbon-epoxy joints with <b>countersunk</b> {{fasteners}} were modelled {{using the}} nonlinear finite element code Abaqus.

Bolt-hole clearance, which arises due to limitations in manufacturing capabilities, is modelled extensively. Clearance levels {{both inside and outside}} typical aerospace fitting tolerances are studied and the finite element model is validated with experimental data. Plots of radial stress in each ply of the <b>countersunk</b> laminate show the load transfer to be severely localised, with only a few plies bearing the majority of the load. The inclusion of clearance in the model was shown to result in far higher radial stresses compared to those in the neat-fit joint model. An associated loss in joint stiffness of more than 10 % was recorded for the highest clearance considered (240 mu m). Finally compressive through-thickness stresses are shown to be present at the damageable region of the <b>countersunk</b> hole, and increase with bolt-hole clearance. These compressive stresses, which are an indicator of lateral constraint, are seen to suppress "brooming" failure in the <b>countersunk</b> laminate. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} to determine the bolt clampup force relaxation behavior in <b>countersunk,</b> single-lap bolted joints between glass/vinylester resin laminates and steel panels. Additionally, the effect of bolt clampup force relaxation on the bearing strength of such joints was studied. Specially-instrumented bolts were used to measure clampup force relaxation in ten <b>countersunk</b> joint specimens. A 100, 000 pound capacity MTS testing machine {{was used to evaluate}} the bearing strength in tension of sixteen <b>countersunk</b> bolted joint specimens torqued to four different levels of initial torque, as well as four similar protruding-head bolted joint specimens (at the same levels of torque). The results of the relaxation experiments indicate that clampup force varies widely in nominally identical joints at identical torque levels, by as much as a factor of two. In <b>countersunk</b> bolt joints with sufficiently high initial clampup force, the clampup force relaxed in accordance with the inverse power equation proposed by Shivakumar and Crews for protruding-head bolt joints in graphite/epoxy laminates. Relaxation in the present experiments proceeded faster than in the protruding-head joints studied by Shivakumar and Crews; this {{is believed to have been}} due to the relative lack of constraint provided at the GRP surface by the <b>countersunk</b> bolt. The results from the bearing strength experiments suggest that clampup force has only a small beneficial effect on bearing strength in both <b>countersunk</b> and protruding head single-lap joints, when compared to double-lap joints. The reduced effectiveness of clampup force in increasing the bearing strength is believed to be a result of the increased joint rotation and bolt bending inherent in single-lap joints. These phenomena lead to delamination and brooming failure in the GRP, which can be avoided in double lap joints with sufficient bolt clampup force. The <b>countersunk</b> joints failed at a load approximately 20 % lower than the protruding head joints. [URL]...|$|R
