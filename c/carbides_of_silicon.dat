40|$|The {{commercial}} {{technologies for}} aluminium production include production of alumina from bauxite by the Bayer process and smelting of alumina to produce aluminium by Hall-Heroult process. The current technology is energy intensive, {{a major source}} of greenhouse gas emissions and harmful fluoride emissions. These issues have stimulated the interests in search for alternative technologies of aluminium production. Carbothermal reduction of alumina is considered a promising alternative technology for aluminium production. However, the carbothermal process in investigation still needs pure alumina which does not solve the problems related to Bayer process, such as generation of harmful red mud, requires very high temperatures, and is overall still an energy intensive process. This thesis is concerned with the development of an environmentally sustainable technology for aluminium production that will avoid the generation of environmentally negative red mud sludge. It is to investigate the feasibility of stepwise carbothermal reduction of bauxite at different temperatures with emphasis on the examination of the mechanisms and kinetics of reduction of different metal oxides in bauxite, and also on the deportment of impurities among the various phases formed. It is expected that, if successful, this technology will significantly decrease energy consumption and CO 2 emissions compared to conventional carbothermal reduction for aluminium production without generation of red mud waste. Understanding the kinetics and mechanisms of reduction of the different metal oxides in bauxite and the effects of operational parameters is essential for the achievement of the optimal conditions for the production of metallic aluminium and by-products such as ferroalloys and possibly titanium and silicon carbides. This project investigated the carbothermal reduction of Western Australian and Queensland bauxites in argon, carbon monoxide and hydrogen atmospheres. Experiments were performed in a high temperature vertical tube furnace and the off-gas composition was monitored using an infra-red gas analyser. The phase composition of reduced samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Oxygen and carbon contents in reduced samples were determined by LECO analysers. The morphology of the surface and intersections was observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The chemical compositions of the phases in the reduced samples were also detected by Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).

Differential thermal analysis (DTA), hardness test and microstructural analysis were then performed on the samples from each composition. The results obtained showed that the hardness of the composite increased gradually as the silicon and silicon carbide particles content increased. The micrographs obtained revealed the presence <b>of</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>carbide,</b> silicon precipitates and aluminium carbide (Al 4 C 3) within the metallic matrix. The amounts of these phases varied with the silicon and silicon carbide content. All the samples gave DTA curves with major endothermic peaks between 550 – 570 oC and two sets of exothermic peaks between 580 – 610 oC for the first set and between 565 – 570 oC for the second set. It was inferred from the study that although varied silicon and silicon carbide contents affected the thermal, hardness and microstructural behaviour of the Al-Si-SiCp composites, the variation of the SiCp content had a more pronounced effect on the hardness value of the Al-Si-SiCp composite...|$|R
40|$|Understanding carbon {{redistribution}} in steels {{is crucial}} in developing advanced high strength steels. For instance, Quenching & Partitioning (Q&P) processes rely on the partitioning of carbon from martensite into austenite, where {{at the end of}} the heat treatment the carbon-enriched austenite shows higher stability at room temperature. Recent literature gives increasing evidence <b>of</b> <b>carbide</b> precipitation occurring during partitioning despite the addition <b>of</b> <b>silicon,</b> conventionally thought to suppress carbide precipitation. The aim of the present study is to gain insight into carbon-competing processes by applying a series of Q&P heat treatments, with particular focus on the partitioning stage, where the role <b>of</b> <b>silicon</b> in the stability of austenite is evaluated. Various characterisation techniques are combined in order to unveil the microstructural changes. While carbide precipitation does appear to occur in the presence <b>of</b> <b>silicon,</b> it is found that silicon plays an active role in the stabilisation of the austenite during the partitioning reaction. </p...|$|R
