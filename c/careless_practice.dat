40|$|The {{link between}} {{experiences}} {{of care and}} criminal justice systems is well-documented, yet curiously neglected in policy and practice. Whilst the over-representation of care leavers in the justice system is often taken as given, there has been negligible change in policy and practice that appropriately responds {{to the needs of}} these individuals. Drawing on interviews with practitioners, this paper highlights a series of organisational and institutional barriers to implementing a unique intervention. More broadly, such barriers contribute to the persistence of <b>care(less)</b> <b>practice,</b> facilitating the neglect of care leavers’ needs to a system dominated by risk. It is argued that the continued inertia within this area can only be construed as practice negligence and an affront to justice...|$|E

40|$|Thesis Submitted in {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the degree Master of Technology (MTech) in Information Technology in the Faculty of Informatics and Design at the Cape Peninsula University of TechnonlogyThe sourcing of IT solutions (whether to provide internal solutions or to outsource services to specialized IT service providers) is a major strategic decision for all organizations. This study sought to explore the dynamics of Knowledge Management (KM) implementations in the Information Technology (IT) services outsourcing industry. A qualitative research method was then used {{to carry out the}} investigation. Using the purposive sampling technique, the IT services industry, comprising IT services clients and service providing organizations (contractors) in both {{the public and private sectors}} were the main sources of primary data, whereas secondary data came from the literature. Then, because of its alignment to the interrogation of a subjective nature that requires interpretation (KM in IT outsourcing industry), critical paradigm together with interpretive paradigm collectively known as critical-interpretive paradigm became appropriate for this study. The primary data was collected through the use of interviews which were subsequently subjected to content analysis and the Actor Network Theory (ANT) was deployed as the analytical lens. ANT aided in drawing a comparison between the ideal IT services industry network and the actual meaning of the findings. Findings reveal that whilst most service providing organizations (contractors) demonstrate significant improvement in the management of knowledge assets, particularly the protection of intellectual property, the same cannot be said of their clients. Further, although there are encouraging cases of good practice and comprehension of the benefits of outsourcing in both sectors, IT services clients still engage in <b>careless</b> <b>practices</b> when appointing their contractors. For example, in most cases the clients’ appointing panels are not representative of all stakeholders but only limited to management with no regard for the input from IT professionals. Low numbers of dedicated KM departments in IT services client organizations is also a concern since it is these departments who should champion the KM processes and implementations. On outsourcing, it is recommended that organizations must implement clear and representative selection policies during the selection of contractors and not just rely on past experiences or exclude other key stakeholders. On the protection of intellectual property (IP) and organizational culture, a recommendation is that organizations should define clear KM processes aimed at addressing issues from deliberate protection of knowledge assets to timely and secure dissemination of knowledge. The allocation of sufficient time to knowledge workers to integrate, discover better ways of doing things is also proposed, together with a concise definition of how new ideas will be evaluated and selected for further development and investment...|$|R
40|$|Fire was an {{ever present}} hazard in {{towns and cities}} until the twentieth century, and in many places the impact of fires upon the {{townscape}} has been very clear. Local historians have long been interested in this subject but, as Michael Barke points out in this important paper, they have tended to consider fires as isolated one-off events and {{to concentrate on the}} largest and most dramatic instances, rather than looking at longer-term patterns and trends and including the smaller, but much more frequent, localised fires in their analyses. The paper looks at Newcastle upon Tyne over a century and a half, and thus seeks to place the events in a wider context. It begins with an explanation of sources—the journals of events kept by two nineteenth century historians, local newspapers, and municipal records. It is emphasised that only serious fires were included—those which involved destruction of property or loss of life, and the almost innumerable small fires were omitted. The analysis first revealed that half of all fires were in workshops and factories, with residential premises surprisingly under-represented. The paper then considers long-term trends, showing that {{the increase in the number}} of fires closely matched that of the population between 1720 and 1820, but then far outstripped population growth for thirty years. Seasonal and diurnal patterns are investigated. The next section deals with the main fire risks, looking at factors such as lack of safety regulation, <b>careless</b> industrial <b>practices,</b> the physical overcrowding of the urban fabric, and the widespread uncontrolled use of hazardous materials and processes. The final section considers responses to these problems, and the arguments over the provision of public fire-fighting services the role of insurance, and the involvement of the private sector...|$|R
40|$|There are 15 {{methods of}} {{traditional}} processed {{fruits and vegetables}} illustrated in this report. Each process {{can be applied to}} the other kinds of fruit and vegetable. These processes are the old methods which are used to preserve the seasonal surpluses of fruits and vegetables in Thailand. According to the principles of food preservation, they are divided into four methods, i. e. drying by sun-drying or evaporation to produce high total solid products, addition of sugar, salt, acid, or combination of them at high concentration, fermentation, and canning. Most of the traditional processed foods are produced in the horn?-scale industries. Some products are made day to day and sold directly to consumers. In the past, many products had low quality and short shelflife due to the lack of basic technology and <b>careless</b> of hygienic <b>practice.</b> Recently, basic technology has been transferred to producers by short-course training, personal contact, self-study from newspapers, magazines, text-books and scientific journals.

40|$|Available {{literature}} on the ecological and toxicological aspects of mercury (Hg) in the environment, with special reference to fish and wildlife resources, is reviewed and summarized. Subdivisions include sources, chemical properties, background concentrations, acute and chronic toxicity, sublethal effects, and proposed criteria to protect sensitive resources. Mercury {{has been used by}} man for at least 2, 300 years, most recently as a fungicide in agriculture, in the manufacture of chlorine and sodium hydroxide, as a slime control agent in the pulp and paper industry, in the production of plastics and electrical apparatus, and in mining and smelting operations. Mercury burdens in some environmental compartments are estimated to have increased up to 5 X precultural levels, primarily as a result of man's activities. The construction of artificial reservoirs, for example, which releases Hg from flooded soils, has contributed to the observed elevation of Hg concentrations in fish tissues from these localities. Elevated levels of Hg in living organisms in Hg-contaminated areas may persist for as long as 100 years after the source of pollution has been discontinued. One major consequence of increased mercury use, coupled with <b>careless</b> waste disposal <b>practices,</b> has been a sharp {{increase in the number of}} epidemics of fatal mercury poisonings in humans, wildlife, and aquatic organisms.

Literature review {{has been done on}} topics such as information disclosure, Corporate governance and risk disclosure in the UK, risk reporting debates, risk management and the Enterprise Risk Management. In the past years, we have witnessed many enterprise scandals due to <b>careless</b> risk management <b>practice.</b> The needs for more efficient corporate governance and higher risk management standard have been developed. After the global crisis, the issue of risk management is even more emphasised, and therefore the real estate industry has been facing increased pressure to disclosure more risk information in their annual reports. An increasing number of risk information disclosure and more sophisticated risk management practice suggests UK real estate companies adopt the market discipline to encourage more detailed risks in order to satisfy the stakeholders. A study of risk disclosure and risk management practices in the UK real estate industry is carried out using the sentence analysis methods. Five hypotheses are derived from the literature review and tested based on the content analysis of the annual reports and accounts of selected UK real estate companies. The results show that the real estate companies are putting an increase effort on risk disclosure and risk management practice. Larger real estate companies are disclosing more risks information and adopt more sophisticated risk management practice than smaller companies. Also, real estate companies are disclosing more “future risks” and “good risks” in their annual reports...|$|R
40|$|The SARS (severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome) {{outbreak of}} 2006 {{and fears of}} avian influenza have sensitized many to the risks of transmission of especially viral illnesses during air travel. People worry about recirculated air, and some wear masks during trips. On several recent flights I have noticed another likely means of viral transmission: <b>careless</b> hygiene <b>practices</b> by flight attendants serving drinks. Using hands I never see washed or cleaned with waterless cleaners, and after handling money required {{for some of the}} drinks, the attendants pull stacks of cups out of their plastic wrappers and handle the cups by the rims when serving the drinks. Rims are the business ends of the cups 9 ̆ 7 to which we apply our mouths when drinking. Wiser practice would be to place the cups upside down and keep them in their plastic sleeves on the cart, pull them out handling only the bottom outside surfaces of the cups, and never touch the rims from which we drink. The containers from which the drinks are served should always have openings that don 9 ̆ 2 t require handling the area over which the liquid flows when poured (think about how we handle milk-carton-type containers in which some kinds of orange juice are packaged). Similar practices should apply in restaurants. Americans fly about 650 million domestic air trips annually. The number of meals eaten out annually is about 100 billion. Observe how your waiters handle pitchers and drinking glasses next time you eat in a restaurant. Does your waiter hold the water glass by the rim as he serves it? Does he place the water pitcher on the table and lean against it with his hands {{on the rim of the}} pitcher while pleasantly chatting with you? If so, he is putting his customers at risk from germs transmitted from his hands, from other customers, from handled money, or from his own nose and skin. The message about the critical importance of hand washing in health care settings may finally be getting enough attention to turn heads and decrease nosocomial infection rates. The cleaning products industry has developed many new, quick, easy methods for sanitizing. But my observations suggest that common sense and thoughtful application of what we know about disease transmission 9 ̆ 7 not only in the hospital setting but also in our everyday lives 9 ̆ 7 are lacking. We practicing physicians need to carry our greater mindfulness about sensible hygiene from the hospital and clinic out into the community. It is a matter of social responsibility and public health.

But {{if these}} evils now continue, {{it can only}} be through rashness which no example can warn, or through apathy which no hope can stimulate, for Mr. Eastlake has alike {{withdrawn}} license from experimentalism and apology from indolence. He has done away with all legends of forgotten secrets; he has shown that the masters of the great Flemish and early Venetian schools possessed no means, followed no methods, but such as we may still obtain and pursue; but he has shown also, among all these masters, the most admirable care in the preparation of materials and the most simple consistency in their use; he has shown that their excellence was reached, and could only have been reached, by stern and exact science, condescending to the observance, care, and conquest of the most minute physical particulars and hindrances; that the greatest of them never despised an aid nor avoided a difficulty. The loss of imaginative liberty sometimes involved in a too scrupulous attention to methods of execution is trivial compared to the evils resulting from a <b>careless</b> or inefficient <b>practice.</b> The modes in which, with every great painter, realization falls short of conception are necessarily so many and so grievous, that he can ill afford to undergo the additional discouragement caused by uncertain methods and bad materials. Not only so, but even the choice of subjects, the amount of completion attempted, nay, even the modes of conception and measure of truth are in no small degree involved in the great question of materials. On the habitual use of a light or dark ground may depend the painter's preference of a broad and faithful, or partial and scenic chiaroscuro; correspondent with the facility or fatality of alterations, may be the exercise of indolent fancy, or disciplined invention; and to the complexities of a system requiring time, patience, and succession of process, may be owing the conversion of the ready draughtsman into the resolute painter. Farther than this, who shall say how unconquerable a barrier to all self-denying effort may exist in the consciousness that the best that is accomplished can last but a few years, and that the painter's travail must perish with his life? ...|$|R
