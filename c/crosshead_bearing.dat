50|$|The neo-classic {{elevation}} {{draws attention}} to its portal: the two pilasters carry a <b>crosshead</b> <b>bearing</b> a bearded mascaron, topped by a pediment which tympanum is adorned with a winged figure and floral motifs.|$|E
50|$|Some late steam engines, mostly {{high-speed}} steam engines, {{were also}} single acting. These also used trunk pistons, {{but in a}} new form. These engines were vertical and used a simple piston design, with no separate trunk but using the sides of an elongated piston as the <b>crosshead</b> <b>bearing</b> surface.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} decades of the 20th century, when large diesel engines were first being used, the engines took a form similar to the {{compound}} steam engines common at the time, with the piston being connected to the connecting rod by a <b>crosshead</b> <b>bearing.</b> Following steam engine practice some manufacturers made double-acting two-stroke and four-stroke diesel engines to increase power output, with combustion taking place on both sides of the piston, with two sets of valve gear and fuel injection. While it produced large amounts of power, the double-acting diesel engine's main problem was producing a good seal where the piston rod passed through the bottom of the lower combustion chamber to the <b>crosshead</b> <b>bearing,</b> and no more were built. By the 1930s turbochargers were fitted to some engines. Crosshead bearings are still used to reduce the wear on the cylinders in large long-stroke main marine engines.|$|E
25|$|Crank pin and <b>crosshead</b> <b>bearings</b> carry small {{cup-shaped}} reservoirs for oil. These have {{feed pipes}} to the bearing surface that start above the normal fill level, or are kept closed by a loose-fitting pin, {{so that only}} when the locomotive is in motion does oil enter. In United Kingdom practice the cups are closed with simple corks, but these {{have a piece of}} porous cane pushed through them to admit air. It is customary for a small capsule of pungent oil (aniseed or garlic) to be incorporated in the bearing metal to warn if the lubrication fails and excess heating or wear occurs.|$|R
50|$|The engine has <b>crosshead</b> <b>bearings</b> so {{that the}} always-vertical piston rod allows a tight seal under the piston. Consequently, the {{lubrication}} of the engine is split: the cylinders and the crankcase use different lubricants, each being specialised for and dedicated to its role. The cylinders are lubricated by continual, timed injection of consumable lubricant, formulated to protect the cylinders from wear and to neutralise the acids formed during combustion of the high-sulfur fuels commonly used. The crosshead design reduces sideways forces on the piston, keeping diametral cylinder liner wear {{in the order of}} only about 0.03 mm per 1000 hours.|$|R
50|$|A {{piston rod}} is {{attached}} to the piston and links it to the crosshead, which is a large casting sliding in crosshead guides (UK: slidebar), allowing it only to move {{in the same direction as}} the piston travel. The crosshead also houses the gudgeon pin on which the small end of the connecting rod pivots. In this way, the transverse forces are applied only to the <b>crosshead</b> and its <b>bearings,</b> not to the piston itself.|$|R
5000|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines using crossheads make for easier {{maintenance of the}} top end of the engine, since the pistons can be easily removed. The piston rod is mounted {{on the underside of}} the piston and connected to the crosshead by a single nut in double acting engines. The large two-stroke marine diesel engines are usually of this pattern. A crosshead is essential in a double-acting diesel engine (see also: [...] battleships: 12 MAN double-acting 2-stroke 9-cylinder diesels). Large diesels often have a plunger oilpump directly attached to the crosshead to supply oil under high pressure to the <b>crosshead</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Companies such as MAN B&W Diesel, and Wärtsilä design {{such large}} {{low-speed}} engines. They are unusually narrow and tall {{due to the}} addition of a <b>crosshead</b> <b>bearing.</b> As of 2007, the 14-cylinder Wärtsilä-Sulzer 14RTFLEX96-C turbocharged two-stroke diesel engine built by Wärtsilä licensee Doosan in Korea is the most powerful diesel engine put into service, with a cylinder bore of 960 mm delivering [...] It was put into service in September 2006, aboard what was then the world's largest container ship Emma Maersk which belongs to the A.P. Moller-Maersk Group. Typical bore size for low-speed engines ranges from approximately 35 to 98 cm. As of 2008, all produced low-speed engines with crosshead bearings are in-line configurations; no Vee versions have been produced.|$|E
40|$|The <b>crosshead</b> <b>bearing</b> {{in large}} {{two-stroke}} diesel engines operates under severe lubrication conditions because hydrodynamic action {{is limited by}} low-amplitude, low-velocity oscillation under high specific load. The recent trend toward more compact engines with increased output raises the bearing specific load, thereby significantly increasing the lubrication severity. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} find a means to prevent tribological failure such as seizure. In this study, a technique for monitoring abnormal vibration was evaluated using a dynamically loaded bearing seizure test rig that is capable of simulating load patterns and relative oscillations of the <b>crosshead</b> <b>bearing</b> in actual engines. Vibration spikes occur around crank angles of ± 90 deg where the oscillating speed is zero during one cycle. When lubrication is impaired, an abnormal vibration spike caused by severe metal-to-metal contact is generated at a crank angle of approximately + 90 deg, where the oil film thickness is a minimum. The frequency of this spike generation increases with the degree of impairment. If running-in is carried out immediately after detecting abnormal vibration, the bearing surface is conformed, thereby avoiding severe metal-to-metal contact damage. The detection of abnormal vibration can be an effective means to prevent seizure of the <b>crosshead</b> <b>bearing...</b>|$|E

This solution example apply to isothermal bearing model with infinity breadth. Lubricating oil {{used in this}} model has Newtonian properties and dynamic viscosity in dependence on pressure. It shows a preliminary analysis change of pressure and capacity forces in the bearing by laminar, unsteady lubrication caused by velocity perturbations of oil flow in the longitudinal direction of a bearing.
