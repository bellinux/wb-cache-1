25|$|The USBC {{completed}} {{data analysis}} and released a lengthy report {{on its website}} (www.bowl.com) {{to the public in}} the spring of 2008. As of April 1, 2009, The USBC now regulates the chemical surface roughness of all bowling balls manufactured for certified ten-pin bowling. This specification is a direct result from the ball motion study, as the surface roughness of the <b>coverstock</b> of a bowling ball was the number one variable (out of 18) that affected the strength (how much a ball hooks) of a bowling ball. The radius of gyration specification has also been tightened and went into effect in 2010. For up to date information on ball specifications, check the USBC Equipment Specifications website at http://bowl.com/equipandspecs/index.jsp.|$|E
25|$|In 1981 Ebonite began {{manufacturing}} {{the very}} first urethane cover stock bowling balls and sold the rights to AMF. Ebonite produced AMF balls at that time. Ebonite {{did not believe that}} bowlers would pay the $80.00 price this new technology would demand. That ball became the AMF Angle and this one <b>coverstock</b> change allowed the ball to get a better grip on the urethane finishes used on natural wood lane surfaces, which changed the nature of the bowling game significantly. Then in 1991, Nu-Line Industries produced the X-Calibur, a reactive resin cover. Part-time professional Steve Cooper was the owner and president of the corporation. But production lagged in the early days, allowing firms like Storm, Brunswick and Columbia to enter the reactive market by the following summer. The race to create more and more dynamic balls was on.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, a new {{material}} known as [...] "reactive resin" [...] was introduced. Reactive resin is still made from polyurethane, {{but has been}} treated with additives while in a liquid state that create pores in the <b>coverstock</b> that allow it to absorb oil. As oil is absorbed into the ball rather than sitting on the surface, there is greater friction between the ball and the lane.|$|E
2500|$|Because spinners do {{not want}} the ball to grab onto the lane with its surface, they often use [...] "plastic" [...] bowling balls - balls with the older {{polyester}} cover-stock popular in the 1970s and 1980s, and commonly used as house balls today - in comparison to the widely used polyurethane, [...] "particle" [...] (polyurethane with nigh-microscopic glass spheres or other hard material throughout the <b>coverstock)</b> and [...] "reactive resin" [...] balls ("reactive resin" [...] is itself polyurethane manufactured using a process to leave microscopic pores throughout it, essentially, a hard sponge) used by bowlers who desire a ball that will grip the lane and roll strongly. Additionally, because the chances of injury are somewhat elevated with this style of bowling, as well as the advantage of ball deflection with this style, the spinner will have a tendency to use lightweight balls between ten and twelve pounds.|$|E
