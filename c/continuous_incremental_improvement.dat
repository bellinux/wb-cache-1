It is therefore {{critical for the}} Genome Sequencing platform of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard to continually strive to reduce cost, improve throughput, and increase {{the quality of its}} data output. In the past, new technology in the form of both chemistry improvements and robotics has allowed the Institute to achieve these goals in a step-wise manner. However, as the rate of technology progression in sequencing has slowed, the Institute has been forced to look to <b>continuous,</b> <b>incremental</b> <b>improvement</b> in order to achieve its goals. The Core Sequencing/Detection group handles the high-throughput sequencing duties at the Broad Institute. Through the use of robotics and cutting edge biology, they are able to process and sequence upwards of 50 billion bases of DNA per year. The work that this thesis was based on took place primarily in this automated production area. This thesis utilizes a number of lean concepts, including the 7 Wastes and pull production control. (cont.) Kanban systems, workflow changes, and a 5 S implementation were used to bring these concepts to life at the Broad Institute. In order to correctly size the kanban system, process buildup diagrams and discrete event simulation were used. Each of these tools helped to drive the process towards the Institute's goals of reducing cost and improving quality and throughput. by Kerry P. Person. Thesis (M. B. A.)

One of the subjects often discussed is the importance of <b>continuous</b> <b>incremental</b> <b>improvements.</b> Nowadays, for many organisations, continuous improvement has become an important topic; many organisations are considering clever ways to organise ongoing <b>incremental</b> <b>improvements.</b> In this thesis, one way of organising such improvements is examined: continuous improvement by improvement teams. An improvenemt team is a group of people tasked with solving problems in their own work, often with the help of a coach. In the thesis, the focus is on the problems that arise when improvement activities are performed by teams. It is investigated whether the correspondences and differences between the operational and the improvement activities carried out by the team members can explain the problems that arise. To examine this, improvement teams, operating in companies, were extensively studied over several years. This thesis contains an overview and discussion of the most significant literature on continuous improvement, the theoretical framework used to examine the research question, a discussion of the research method that was used, an analysis of the research data that was collected, and a discussion of the major findings...|$|R

In the future PhiloBiblon will be enriched, most importantly, through first-hand inspection of primary sources and by making use of the increasing number of secondary and tertiary  sources now available on line.           This leads to a consideration of the current state of information technology and medieval studies.

40|$|Integrating Knowledge Management {{maturity}} with associated Continuous Improvement {{efforts in}} order to remain competitive, is absent in most Operational Excellence initiatives. Furthermore, the intertwined relationship of Continuous Improvement and work development becomes a crucial focus area for organisations that wish to establish a continuously evolving management system consisting of core values, methodologies and tools with the aim of creating more satisfied customers with less resources. The old industrial paradigm that focused on labour, capital, materials, and energy viewed technology and knowledge as external influences on production. This framework is now being challenged and a new trend is emerging. This trend seeks to transform the old industrial system to that of a knowledge-based which one can lead to innovation and hence economic advantage. Continuous Improvement as a concept has roots in many other fields, including social-technical system design, human relations progress and the discussion surrounding ‘lean manufacturing’. This study will focus on Continuous Improvement as a noun, referring to on the outcome of the process of a stream of emergent innovations. The primary objective of the study is to create a model that will present an organisation with a three-layer knowledge reference process grid, which will align and depict the surrounding business knowledge functions, knowledge-enabling processes and knowledge-manipulating processes aiming for enabling Operational Excellence. This study promotes the theory that the cognitive domain layer, functional domain layer and resources layer of an organisation can be increasingly stimulated by focusing effort through Continuous Improvement routines towards the associated inter-organisational knowledge processes sustaining Operational Excellence. The proposed model is structured to review, compare, evaluate and integrate existing Knowledge Management practices of ii an organisation within the context of clear definitions for important concepts of Knowledge Management. Additionally the model provides an assessment instrument for evaluating the organisation’s Knowledge Management maturity level. The study concerns itself with two concepts towards business value creation which will lead to increased Operational Excellence. Firstly, the maturity of Knowledge Management processes, and secondly the level of the organisation wide process of focused and <b>continuous</b> <b>incremental</b> <b>improvement</b> namely, Continuous Improvement. A case study with PriceWaterhouseCoopers was concluded and an on-line Internet survey was used with a stratified sample from knowledge workers to test the factors from both a Knowledge Management and Continuous Improvement perspective. These factors were verified by means of a hypotheses network, describing in a structured and descriptive way, the importance of Knowledge Management and Continuous Improvement collectively on sustainable Operational Excellence as an integral development of Operational Excellence. With respect to Knowledge Management practices, the hypothesis network proposed at least three domains, which of knowledge generation, knowledge mobilisation and knowledge application as important input to the proposed process grid of knowledge development and associated layer elements. From a Continuous Improvement principles perspective it is apparent that elements from Continuous Improvement routines and Continuous Improvement characteristics are associated with the organisation Continuous Improvement ability. These findings are also a result of the deliberate design of processes, tools, structures and environments with the intent to increase, renew, share or improve the use of knowledge represented in any of the three elements for structural, human and social of intellectual capital. The proposed model combines the framework of the Boyd cycle as it is conceptualized as self-assessment activities, for it becomes possible to use them as basis of a self-assessment with sense making navigational properties across iii the proposed knowledge process grid for the model. The model will facilitate the concept of a three-layer knowledge reference process grid, which represents the main components of the knowledge processes within the cognitive domain layer, functional layer and resources layer of an organisation. The proposed model will deliver a single value that co-exists with the Knowledge Management maturity level and Continuous Improvement readiness index rating attained. Logical relationships to dynamic, evolving and flexible enabling Knowledge Management practices for each layer of the proposed three-layer knowledge reference process grid will be integrated as output of the proposed model. The research has limitations as Knowledge Management practices were measured using a subjective norm scale. It is suggested that a more comprehensive measure of Knowledge Management maturity processes may be needed to represent this construct. The complexity of the proposed model and the number of associated variables included in the results need further confirmation using possible multiple samples and additional measures of Knowledge Management maturity and Continuous Improvement readiness elements. The benefit of the proposed model as a practical Operational Excellence tool is to overcome the perceived gap of implementing Knowledge Management practices and Continuous Improvement principles collectively to deliver and sustain Operational Excellenc...|$|E

This study investigated the key factors that drive the adoption of internal competition and internal collaboration, the consequences of implementing each approach, how levels of internal competition and internal collaboration vary at different management levels and whether a viable hybrid combination of both management approaches is possible. A qualitative exploratory study by in-depth interview was conducted with twenty senior executives.

Two factors triggered the need for understanding the innovation systems: Ethiopian dairy subsector {{has not been able to}} take-off despite decades of research and development efforts; and the context for the subsector development is changing. The purpose of the research was to identify organizational, institutional and policy options to facilitate market-driven and knowledge-based smallholder dairy development in the country. Specifically, the analysis looked at contextual factors determining opportunities and necessities for innovation; the key innovation systems actors, pattern of interaction between them; coordination mechanisms; and the subsector development policy and strategy. The investigation was based on a survey of actors and their roles and interactions, review of policy, and project documents and available empirical evidence. The research identified constraints and challenges relating to market, supportive services, interaction of actors, inter-organizational coordination, and gaps in the subsector development policy and strategy. Finally,options are identified that can enhance commercialization and innovation. The options include: strengthening dairy cooperatives with emphasis on their business-orientation, linking them, where appropriate, vertically to processors and input suppliers, and strategically linking dairy development intervention to informal markets through food security/food transfer programs and institutionalized school feeding programs; public support for the development of private service and pluralistic service delivery system, alongside strengthening public capacity for performing regulatory and quality assurance functions effectively; formulating national dairy development policy and strategy to ensure coordinated policy implementation on the ground; encouraging the integration of emerging dairy cooperatives at higher levels and capacity building to enable them to demand service, command accountability, and serve as a mouthpiece of producers; capitalizing on the on-going Business Process Re-engineering for revising the prevailing reward systems in public research and extension to encourage innovation and impactorientation; creating incentive system such as leverage fund and competitive grant to encourage intervention-based public–private innovation partnership; and strengthening dairy platform at woreda and/or milkshed level for achieving of better impact through <b>continuous</b> <b>incremental</b> <b>improvements</b> and to facilitate scaling out and up of successful experience to achieve wider impact and inform higher policymaking.

40|$|In {{managing}} organisations {{for optimal}} performance, managers {{are faced with}} the dilemma of either positioning their employees to compete or collaborate internally within the organisation. Internal competition can motivate individuals and teams to strive to be the best and in so doing result in <b>continuous</b> <b>incremental</b> performance <b>improvements.</b> In contrast, internal collaboration can result in effective problem solving through knowledge sharing and innovation. Management is therefore faced with a challenging dilemma of how best to leverage these seemingly opposing tensions for optimal performance. This study investigated the key factors that drive the adoption of internal competition and internal collaboration in organisations, the consequences of implementing either management approach, how levels of internal competition and internal collaboration vary at different management levels in the organisation and finally whether a viable hybrid combination of both management approaches was possible. To this end a qualitative research study with an explorative design was conducted with twenty senior executives. The insights from these in-depth interviews formed the basis of the data that was analysed to produce the research findings in this study. The research identified drivers and outcomes of the management approaches under review. The Internal Competition and Internal Collaboration Hybrid Model (Figure 14) emerged from these research findings. This model was found to confirm while the management approaches are different there is an optimal way of combining them to allow managers to leverage competitive and collaborative tensions. In this way managers can achieve sustainable high performance within their organisation.

40|$|From the {{perspective}} of educators, games are viewed as a medium in which the younger generation both thrive and excel. Students navigate game environments with ease and regularly solve problems, engage in advanced collaborative efforts, and communicate complex concepts and strategies to one another during their private gaming sessions at home. Games invite the player to form an understanding of intricate systems and mechanics based on participation and experimentation rather than mere observation, and on these merits games are often prophesized as a medium that will significantly {{change the face of}} education as we know it. However, while teacher interest in using games is increasing, wide-spread and successful examples of games being implemented in formal educational contexts (e. g. schools and university courses) remain rare. This thesis aims to examine why this is the case and identifies some of the more prevalent obstacles educators and developers both face when embarking on learning game projects as users and creators. In order to examine the situation from both of these perspectives, the research takes a mixed-method approach that entails extensive literature studies coupled with several studies with both educators and developers. Interviews were conducted in order to investigate attitudes and experiences, and more direct researcher participation and case studies were used to examine the processes of implementing and developing learning games as they were carried out. The studied cases and literature have revealed obstacles that indicate that “traditional” entertainment game development is incommensurable with learning game development, and that the use of games in formal educational settings introduces heavy demands on the recipient organization’s infrastructure, culture, and working processes. The conclusion of this research is that learning games embody a unique mixture of utility and game experience, and the formal context which they are to be used in significantly influence the process of developing and using them. Learning games can’t be understood if they’re solely seen as a teaching utility or solely as a game experience and to make them viable both educators and developers need to change their internal processes, their own perceptions of games and teaching, as well as the way they collaborate and communicate with each other. There are also several obstacles that are outside individual institutions and developers’ control, for example the practicalities of the economic constraints that both developers and educators work under that put the sustainability of pursuing learning games for formal education as a business into question. However, the <b>continuous</b> <b>incremental</b> <b>improvements</b> on the infrastructure of educational institutions (e. g. availability of technology and teachers’ familiarity with technology) can likely alleviate many of the obstacles currently inhibiting the impact learning games can potentially have in formal education.
