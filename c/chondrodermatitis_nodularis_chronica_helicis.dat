40|$|<b>Chondrodermatitis</b> <b>nodularis</b> <b>chronica</b> <b>helicis</b> in {{a patient}} with {{systemic}} sclerosis associated with primary biliary cirrhosis (Reynolds syndrome) : A case report <b>Chondrodermatitis</b> <b>nodularis</b> <b>chronica</b> <b>helicis</b> is a rare non-neoplastic inflammatory and degenerative process of the external ear, charac-terized by necrobiotic changes in the dermis that extend down to the perichondrium. This condition has been occasionally reported in patients with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis but not in those with concomitant primary biliary cirrhosis; this association is known as Reynolds syndrome. We report a 70 -year-old woman diagnosed with primary biliary cirrhosis at age 47 and with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis at age 54 who developed a painful ulcerated nodule on the helical rim of the left ear shortly after the last diagnosis. The lesion was excised because of the suspicion of malignancy, but the histopathology was consistent with <b>chondrodermatitis</b> <b>nodularis</b> <b>chronica</b> <b>helicis.</b> Although this condition is infrequent, {{it is necessary to}} know, because it may occur in patients with systemic sclerosis and be mistaken for neoplasms, such as basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma, and these patients have an increased risk for the devel-opment of skin malignancies.

40|$|Background: <b>Chondrodermatitis</b> <b>nodularis</b> <b>chronica</b> <b>helicis</b> (CNCH) is a benign, painful, {{indurated}} inflammatory nodule arising on the pinna. Different treatment modalities {{have been}} used with varying efficacy rates. Despite lower efficacy, conservative methods are most desirable. Case reports: Three patients diagnosed with CNCH were treated with 0. 4 % topical nitroglycerin ointment, twice daily. These included two women and one man, aged 66, 86, and 60 -years-old, respectively. Two painful nodules were located on the antihelix, {{and one on the}} helix. One patient had been previously treated with intralesional corticosteroids, and another with intralesional corticosteroids, CO 2 laser and photodynamic therapy. All three patients experienced significant clinical and symptomatic improvement with topical nitroglycerin. No side effects were reported. Discussion: The etiology of CNCH is uncertain. Dermal and chondral ischemia arising from perichondrial arterial narrowing has been recently described as a possible cause for this benign condition, hence the potential of nitroglycerin as a smooth muscle relaxant and vasodilator. A previous report described significant improvement in twelve patients treated with 2 % topical nitroglycerin. Conclusion: Topical nitroglycerin ointment appears to be a noninvasive alternative for the treatment of CNCH. A lower concentration (0. 4 %) may be as effective and with fewer side effects, but more studies are warranted...|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{purpose of}} this study was to define the {{pathological}} changes of some lesions of the elastic cartilage of the epiglottis of the larynx and the auricle and to consider their pathogenesis. Methods. Surgical histological material was examined from one patient with pseudocyst of the epiglottis, one with pseudocyst of the auricle of the ear and four with <b>chondrodermatitis</b> <b>nodularis</b> helicis, in one of whom the lesion was bilateral. Results. The pseudocyst of the epiglottis was situated between the anterior and posterior surfaces of that organ. In the anterior region of the epiglottic cartilage, but not the posterior, perichondrium was fibrotic, and chondrocytes and elastic fibres were markedly reduced. There were similar changes in relation to the auricular cartilage pseudocyst. In the auricles with chondrodermatitis the changes were those of focal necrosis of the rim of the cartilage at the helix with associated acute inflammation, ulceration and hyperplasia of the overlying epidermis. In one lesion necrotic cartilage had been extruded and lay on the floor of the ulcer. Thickening of the walls of small arteries was seen near the perichondrium of the heliceal region. Conclusions. The patient with pseudocyst of the epiglottis had severe gastro-oesophageal reflux which had necessitated recent gastric surgery. The acid reflux may have caused perichondrial ischaemia of the anterior epiglottic cartilage resulting in the pseudocyst. The auricular pseudocyst was associated with similar focal perichondrial damage on one surface only, probably caused by trauma. <b>Chondrodermatitis</b> <b>nodularis</b> helicis is likely produced by ischaemia of perichondrium at the poorly vascularized helix</p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Chondrodermatitis</b> <b>Nodularis</b> Helicis is {{a benign}} {{inflammatory}} process affecting {{the skin and}} cartilage of the ear. It typically presents as a painful nodule surrounded by an area of erythema and often prevents the patient from sleeping on the affected side. Many treatments have been described in the literature, but the condition is prone to recurrence. A literature search was performed {{in order to identify}} the best possible treatment. Fifty-eight articles were included, describing and investigating nonsurgical as well as surgical treatment modalities. Large prospective, controlled, and randomised long-term studies are lacking, but based on the available literature, we recommend starting with a conservative approach using decompression devices. Simple surgical procedures should only be used if conservative measures fail...|$|R

40|$|Five {{cases of}} spectacle-frame {{acanthoma}} are reported; four were retro-auricular (three unilateral; one bilateral) {{and one was}} present {{on the left side}} of the nose. Clinical aspects of the lesions are described by the light of all the other cases that have been previously reported in the literature. Histopathological features are compared to those encountered in <b>chondrodermatitis</b> <b>nodularis</b> helicis for which a frictional origin may also be suspected. In the vast majority of cases, spontaneous resolution is obtained when responsible spectacle frames are removed whereas a few lesions persist indefinitely despite of the fact that corrective measures are applied, on the contrary to what has been reported in previous papers. Apart from removing spectacles, these few cases needed surgical excision for a complete cure. Anatomo-clinical confrontations seem to indicate that those persistent lesions are completely fissured acanthomas...|$|R
