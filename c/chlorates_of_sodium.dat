The {{analogy of}} the decomposing or {{experimental}} cell {{to the other}} cells of the voltaic battery renders it nearly certain that any of those substances which are decomposable when fluid, as described in my last paper (402.), would, {{if they could be}} introduced between the metallic plates of the pile, be equally effectual with water, if not more so. Sir Humphry Davy found that litharge and <b>chlorate</b> <b>of</b> potassa were thus effectual[A]. I have constructed various voltaic arrangements, and found the above conclusion to hold good. When any of the following substances in a fused state were interposed between copper and platina, voltaic action more or less powerful was produced.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{experimentally}} investigated the use <b>of</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>chlorate</b> as an oxygen storage medium {{for use in}} underwater fuel cell power systems. Research into improving hydrogen storage systems is the primary concern when designing fuel cell systems with access to atmospheric oxygen. However, in an underwater environment, performance of the oxygen storage system cannot be overlooked. Oxygen candles using sodium chlorate offer gravimetric storage densities similar to compressed gas storage while also offering volumetric storage densities greater than both gas and cryogenic liquid oxygen storage. Unfortunately, this technology {{does not allow for}} controllable rates of oxygen production and is known to cause fires and occasionally explosions when contaminated with organic materials or exposed to external sources of heat. Though useful as an emergency source <b>of</b> oxygen, <b>sodium</b> <b>chlorate</b> will not be viable for use in power systems until safer and more controllable methods of releasing its oxygen are implemented. During this project we developed a batch method for releasing oxygen from <b>sodium</b> <b>chlorate.</b> Two grams <b>of</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>chlorate</b> with nanoscale cobalt oxide catalyst were loaded into a reaction chamber and heated until decomposition. Afterwards a piston was used to eject the materials from the reaction chamber. This method proved to be safer and more reliable than similar chlorate-based oxygen systems as the primary modes of failure, those associated with the buildup of solid residue at the inlets and exits of the reaction chamber, were removed. Aside from preventing the flow of oxygen to a fuel cell, the over-pressurization caused by these problems could compromise the reaction chamber and potentially result in catastrophic failures. The achieved rate of oxygen production, 0. 21 L/min with a heating rate between 25 W and 33 W, was below the target 1. 13 L/min needed to operate a 200 W PEM fuel cell. Further assessment of this method will require the use of a more active cobalt oxide catalyst, a system with a larger reaction chamber capable of decomposing increased amounts sodium chlorate per cycle and a reduction in heat losses through the use of improved insulation and thermal isolation techniques. by Jorge David Garcia.

The transepithelial transport <b>of</b> <b>sodium</b> and the <b>sodium</b> content <b>of</b> the tissue were found to increase rapidly with rise in concentration <b>of</b> <b>sodium</b> in the mucosal medium up to values of 30 to 60 meq per liter.

40|$|Some {{bacteria}} can use (per) chlorate as terminal electron acceptor for growth. These bacteria convert perchlorate via chlorate and chlorite into chloride and molecular oxygen. Oxygen formation in microbial respiration is unique. In this study two chlorate-reducing strains {{belonging to the}} species Pseudomonas chloritidismutans and a (per) chlorate -reducing strain Dechloromonas hortensis were isolated. The characterization of the chlorate-reducing strain AW- 1, which was isolated from a bioreactor treating a chlorate and bromate polluted waste stream, enabled the comparison of denitrifying bacteria with (per) chlorate-reducing bacteria. Despite a very close phylogenetic relationship between strain AW- 1 and two Pseudomonas stutzeri strains, the former {{was not able to}} use nitrate as electron acceptor, and the latter two were not able to use chlorate. These results confirmed that separate pathways exist for chlorate and nitrate reduction. In accordance, chlorite dismutase activity was only present in strain AW- 1 and it was therefore proposed to name strain AW- 1, Pseudomonas chloritidismutans sp. nov [...] P. chloritidismutans was differentiated from other described (per) chlorate -reducing bacteria, by its inability to use perchlorate. To get more insight into the pathway <b>of</b> <b>chlorate</b> reduction, the <b>chlorate</b> reductase <b>of</b> P. chloritidismutans was purified and characterized. The oxygen sensitive chlorate reductase showed only reductase activity with chlorate and bromate which was different from the purified (per) <b>chlorate</b> reductase <b>of</b> the (per) chlorate-reducing strain GR- 1, which in addition showed activity with perchlorate, nitrate and Mn(V). The <b>chlorate</b> reductase <b>of</b> Ideonella dechloratans also showed no reductase activity with perchlorate. The cytoplasmic localization <b>of</b> the <b>chlorate</b> reductase <b>of</b> P. chloritidismutans was different from the periplasmic orientation <b>of</b> the (per) <b>chlorate</b> reductase <b>of</b> strain GR- 1 and <b>of</b> the <b>chlorate</b> reductase <b>of</b> I. dechloratans. The native enzyme had a molecular mass of 167 kDa and consisted of 3 subunits of 97, 38 and 34 kDa. The same stoichiometry (Î± 1 Î² 1 Î³ 1) was found for the <b>chlorate</b> reductase <b>of</b> I. dechloratans but this was different from the stoichiometry found for the (per) <b>chlorate</b> reductase <b>of</b> strain GR- 1 (Î± 3 Î² 3). The b -subunit <b>of</b> the <b>chlorate</b> reductase <b>of</b> P. chloritidismutans revealed sequence similarity to b-subunits of various other reductases or dehydrogenases. The chlorate reductase from P. chloritidismutans was found to contain Mo and Fe, as was the case for the reductase of strain GR- 1. EPR analysis confirmed this. The presence of molybdenum is not unusual because sofar, all enzymes that show chlorate reductase activity contain molybdenum (<b>chlorate</b> reductase <b>of</b> P. chloritidismutans and I. dechloratans, (per) <b>chlorate</b> reductase <b>of</b> strain GR- 1, nitrate reductase, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) reductase). These enzymes are positioned in the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) reductase family. The chlorite dismutase was purified from P. chloritidismutans and this enzyme showed similar characteristics when compared to chlorite dismutases of strain GR- 1, Dechloromonas agitata and I. dechloratans. The localization (periplasm), subunit composition (homotetramer), subunit size and the spectral characteristics (heme group, Fe-protoporphyrin IX) were the same. Experiments with 18 O-labelled water showed that no 36 O 2 or 34 O 2 labeled oxygen was produced, indicating that water is not a substrate in the conversion of chlorite and that oxygen is entirely produced out of chlorite. The N-terminal sequence of the chlorite dismutase of P. chloritidismutans had no similarity with the N-terminal sequences of other chlorite dismutases. Instead, similarity was found with an internal sequence of a hypothetical protein of dechloratans The gene coding for this hypothetical protein (partial ORF 2) was located downstream of the gene of the chlorite dismutase. PCR experiments showed that the chlorite dismutase gene arrangement of P. chloritidismutans was different from the organization of the chlorite dismutase gene and partial ORF 2 which was found for dechloratansThe previously isolated strain GR- 1 had not yet been taxonomically described. Therefore, 16 S rDNA sequence analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization experiments were performed. It was found that strain GR- 1 was related at the species level to another (per) chlorate -reducing strain, Dechlorosoma suillum, which was recently renamed as Azospira oryzae. The occurrence <b>of</b> (per) <b>chlorate</b> -reducing bacteria in certain environments is a result of Â  the contamination with (per) chlorate by anthropogenic activities. However, in this study also the possibility of (a) biotic processes by which chlorate can be formed is discussed...|$|R
