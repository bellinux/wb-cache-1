5|$|The {{controversy}} over Bennett's actions became public in mid-1945, {{when the war}} ended and Percival and Callaghan were released from Japanese captivity. Percival, who had never got on with Bennett, wrote a letter accusing him of relinquishing his command without permission. Callaghan delivered the letter to Blamey upon his release and Blamey convened a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> under Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead, and Major Generals Victor Stantke and George Wootten, which found that Bennett was not justified in handing over his command, or in leaving Singapore. Veterans of the 8th Division, who were generally loyal to Bennett, protested against this finding.|$|E
5|$|A <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> {{was held}} the {{following}} month in Liverpool by the Board of Trade, and focused particularly on {{the roles of the}} captains in the tragedy as well as the design of the Liverpool lifeboat. The court found that no-one was to blame for the loss of either Ellen Southard or the Liverpool lifeboat. Captain James Martin and his crew were praised for their gallantry in getting everyone off the ship, and absolved of any blame with respect to the capsizing of the lifeboat. The lifeboat was furthermore found to be of sound design and suitably adapted to her role, but debate continued for many years about the merits of the tubular design vs the self-righting one, as well as the requirement for lifeboats to be powered.|$|E
5|$|Following the defeat, the Chief of the German General Staff, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, {{ordered the}} Supreme Army Command {{to conduct a}} <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> into the {{defensive}} collapse of the Arras sector. The court concluded that the Sixth Army headquarters had disregarded frontline commander reports, noting a possible imminent attack and as a result, reserve units were kept too far back to execute a timely and effective counterattack. The court concluded that Sixth Army commander General Ludwig von Falkenhausen failed to apply an elastic defence properly as espoused by German defensive doctrine of the time. Instead, the defensive system {{was a series of}} unmoving strong points and static lines of resistance, which the Allied artillery ultimately isolated and destroyed. As a result of the inquiry, Hindenburg removed Falkenhausen from his command and transferred him to Belgium where he served the remainder of the war as that country's Governor General.|$|E

50|$|The Bill {{provided}} for the replacement of trial by jury by courts-martial in those areas where IRA activity was prevalent and a further extension of the jurisdiction of courts-martial to include capital offences. In addition military <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> were to be substituted for coronersâ€™ inquests. This was primarily as local authorities were finding British soldiers liable in killing Irish people.|$|R
5|$|On 27 January 1915, Colonel Martin {{announced}} that the 5th Light Infantry was {{to be transferred to}} Hong Kong for further garrison duties, replacing another Indian regiment. However, rumours were circulated among the sepoys that they might instead be sent to Europe or to Turkey to fight against their Muslim co-religionists. Three Indian officers, Subedar Dunde Khan, Jemedar Christi Khan, and Jemedar Ali Khan, were later to be identified by a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> as key conspirators in the matter. When the final order to sail to Hong Kong aboard the Nile arrived in February 1915, they and other ringleaders among the sepoys decided {{that it was time to}} rebel. On the morning of 15 February, the General Officer Commanding Singapore addressed a farewell parade of the regiment, complimenting the sepoys on their excellent turnout and referring to their departure the next day, without mentioning Hong Kong as the destination. At 3:30pm on the afternoon of the same day, four Rajput companies of the eight companies making up the 5th Light Infantry mutinied. The mostly Pathan sepoys of the remaining four companies did not join the mutiny but scattered in confusion. Two British officers of the regiment were killed as they attempted to restore order.|$|E

50|$|When {{a certain}} case was {{presented}} to the <b>court,</b> one method <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> was by the examination of witnesses, there were then, as now, both false and true witnesses. The Sirupancamulam condemns the witness who deposes to an untruth. The false witness is mentioned as one among the six offenders of a State. The other five are pseudo-Sannyasins, housewives loose in morals, disloyal ministers, adulterers and tale-bearers. In different places of the Silappathikaram, deposing as false witness is treated as a great crime. Thus, we see how carefully justice was administered and the dignity of law and order was maintained.|$|R
25|$|After a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> {{chaired by}} William McNair KC the Ministry of Civil Aviation {{announced}} that the probable cause of the accident was the loading of the aircraft, which had moved the centre of gravity considerably aft of where it should have been, thus reducing {{the effectiveness of the}} elevators.|$|E
25|$|A {{military}} <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> put {{the majority}} of blame for the incident on the prisoners, but {{found that there were}} cultural differences in the camp, which led to the deadly actions and needed to be addressed. Among the issues was that the Japanese did not know that under the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, compulsory work was allowed. The event remains a testimony to cultural misunderstanding for the Featherston community today.|$|E
25|$|The {{errors in}} the {{official}} KLM approach chart the crew had relied on. It emerged during the enquiry that these charts had been copied from war-era United States Air Force charts, which upon subsequent examination were also found to be faulty.

50|$|NWEA put {{together}} {{a report on the}} effects of the controversial Satyamangalam Railway line on this ecologically sensitive area. The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) <b>of</b> the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> India, after <b>enquiry,</b> found that the area is home to both elephants and tigers, and other species listed in Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. On the basis of this observation the CEC directed the Railways to withdraw the project.

Ex-poachers and their wives have since been assisted in gaining new employment in the eco-tourism business.|$|R
40|$|The {{reliability}} of eyewitness identification has attracted concern from {{the legal profession}} in England for at least 100 years. In 1904 a committee <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> was established to investigate the trials of Adolf Beck. Incredibly, on two separate occasions Adolf Beck was wrongly convicted {{on the basis of}} mistaken eyewitness identification. In both trials, multiple eyewitnesses identified Beck as a confidence trickster who stole jewellery from them. The crimes were subsequently found to have been committed by William Wyatt. The 1904 Committee <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> led directly to the establishment <b>of</b> a <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Appeal. ...|$|R

25|$|The <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Enquiry</b> found Captain Lee {{culpable}} for {{the loss}} of his ship. Blue Star Line dismissed him and he turned to being a publican in England.

He later emigrated to India, where he died shortly after his arrival.|$|E
25|$|The Free State unit the Dublin Guard, and in {{particular}} their commander, Paddy Daly, were widely held {{to be responsible for}} these killings. They, however, claimed that the prisoners had been killed while clearing roads by landmines laid by Republicans. When questioned in the DÃ¡il by Labour Party leader Thomas Johnson, Richard Mulcahy, the National Army's commander-in-chief, supported Daly's story. A military <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Enquiry</b> conducted in April 1923 cleared the Free State troops of the charge of killing their prisoners.|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study explores how knowledge and concepts of knowledge are experienced in an undergraduate teacher education course that employs a community <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> pedagogy. As designer and facilitator {{of the course}} I engaged students in enquiries and enquiry-based activities to learn about art. Using an action-research approach I made changes to the course design in response to how it played out. The art <b>of</b> the Constitutional <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> South Africa {{was the focus of}} our study and students developed structured and logical â€˜frameworksâ€™ for analysing artworks as well as playing with laterally extending concepts such as art, justice, equality and humanity. The findings suggest that the dialogical and embodied practice of a community <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> pedagogy strongly influenced my studentsâ€™ and my own awareness of knowledge as a creative and experiential opening up and as a companion to the equally valuable experience of not knowing. Teaching within this epistemological framework demands democratic and reflexive pedagogies such as the community <b>of</b> <b>enquiry...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{most likely}} {{cause of the}} {{disaster}} {{appears to have been}} overheating of cordite charges stored alongside a boiler room bulkhead, and this was the explanation accepted by the <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>enquiry.</b> It has also been suggested that damage caused to one of the shells stored in the battleship's cross-passageways may have weakened the fusing mechanism and caused the shell to become 'live'. A blow to the shell, caused by it being dropped point down, could then have set off a chain reaction of explosions among the shells stored in Bulwarks cross-passageways sufficient to detonate the ship's magazines.|$|E
500|$|A <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> {{praised the}} {{surviving}} crew and their dead captain and authorised the award of the Victoria Cross posthumously to Thomas Crisp and Distinguished Service Medals {{to his son}} and {{another member of the}} crew. On 29 October 1917, David Lloyd George made an emotional speech in the House of Commons citing Crisp's sacrifice as representative of the Royal Navy's commitment [...] "from the icy waters of the Arctic Ocean to the stormy floods of Magellan", which promoted Crisp into an overnight celebrity whose story ran in all the major London papers for nearly a week, containing as it did a story of personal sacrifice, filial devotion and perceived German barbarity. The medal presentation was made to Tom Crisp Jr. at Buckingham Palace on 19 December 1917, shortly before he was promoted to Skipper in his own right.|$|E
500|$|There was no {{time for}} evasive action, and three of the four torpedoes struck {{amidships}} so closely together as to throw up a single massive water column. Barham quickly capsized to port and was lying on her side when a massive magazine explosion occurred aft about four minutes after she was torpedoed and sank her. The <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Enquiry</b> into the sinking ascribed the final magazine explosion to a fire in the 4-inch magazines outboard of the main 15-inch magazines, which would have then spread to and detonated the contents of the main magazines. Due to the speed at which she sank, 862 officers and ratings were killed, including two who died of their wounds after being rescued. The destroyer [...] rescued some 337 survivors, including Vice-Admiral Henry Pridham-Wippell and the pair who later died of their wounds, while the Australian destroyer [...] reportedly rescued some 150 men. The sinking was captured on film by a cameraman from PathÃ© News, aboard Valiant.|$|E

Based on available historical evidence, although the mutineers clearly directed their murderous intentions towards the British, they were careful to avoid targeting and the killing of British women [...] Unfortunately, {{the fact that only}} one British woman was killed was often ignored in the reports that followed the mutiny. For instance, in a long letter detailing her experience during the mutiny, a British woman who was an eyewitness to the incident misleadingly wrote in to The Times that the sepoys had [...] "deliberately shot at every European man or woman they saw" [...] and that [...] "21 English men and women were buried yesterday" [...] (26 March 1915). Sir Evelyn Ellis, a member of the Legislative Council in Singapore and of the official <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> that investigated the mutiny, publicly described the revolt as [...] "part of a scheme for the murder of women and children". More than 15 years later, in 1932, a journalist in Penang, George Bilainkin, wrote that during the mutiny, the sepoys had [...] "knifed and shot white men and women indiscriminately".
