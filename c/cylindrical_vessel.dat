25|$|Coffee may be brewed by {{steeping}} in {{a device}} {{such as a}} French press (also known as a cafetière, coffee press or coffee plunger). Ground coffee and hot water are combined in a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>vessel</b> and left to brew for a few minutes. A circular filter which fits tightly in the cylinder fixed to a plunger is then pushed {{down from the top}} to force the grounds to the bottom. The filter retains the grounds at the bottom as the coffee is poured from the container. Because the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the water, all the coffee oils remain in the liquid, making it a stronger beverage. This method of brewing leaves more sediment than in coffee made by an automatic coffee machine. Supporters of the French press method point out that the sediment issue can be minimized by using the right type of grinder: they claim that a rotary blade grinder cuts the coffee bean into a wide range of sizes, including a fine coffee dust that remains as sludge {{at the bottom of the}} cup, while a burr grinder uniformly grinds the beans into consistently-sized grinds, allowing the coffee to settle uniformly and be trapped by the press. Within the first minute of brewing 95% of the caffeine is released from the coffee bean.|$|E

The cyclic loading response of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>vessels</b> under load and deformation controlled cyclic loading is compared for the cases where creep is included and excluded. Kinematic hardening theory of plasticity {{based on the}} multi-linear Prager and Armstrong– Frederick models is assumed to evaluate the multi-axial non-linear strains in the plastic region. An iterative incremental method is proposed to solve the governing equations due to the non-linearity and load history dependency of the problem. Based on the obtained results an interaction diagram is proposed to predict ratcheting or shakedown behaviour of the thick <b>cylindrical</b> <b>vessels...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Failure of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>vessels</b> can {{be caused}} by stress {{singularity}} at pitting corrosion induced cracks. Literature suggests that most of research focuses on how to determine stress intensity factors for surface cracks with low aspect ratios, i. e.,a/c≤ 1. 0. Situation may well arise where the aspect ratio of cracks is larger than one. This paper attempts to propose a weight function method to determine stress intensity factors for high aspect ratio semi-elliptical cracks in <b>cylindrical</b> <b>vessels.</b> The weight functions are derived based on three dimensional finite element analysis. The proposed weight function method is verified numerically. It is found that the higher the aspect ratio of cracks the larger the stress intensity factors, and that the aspect ratio of cracks may alter the failure mode of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>vessels...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Beebe's initial design {{called for}} a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>vessel,</b> and {{articles}} describing his plans were published in The New York Times.

[...] So many unqualified opportunists were attempting to join Beebe in his efforts that Beebe tended to ignore most of his mail, and Barton's first efforts to contact him were fruitless. [...] A mutual friend of Barton's and Beebe's eventually arranged a meeting between the two, enabling Barton to present his design to Beebe in person. [...] Beebe approved of Barton's design, {{and the two of them}} made a deal: Barton would pay for the vessel and all of the other equipment to go with it, while Beebe would pay for other expenses such as chartering a ship to raise and lower it, and as the owner of the vessel Barton would accompany Beebe on his dives in it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{mechanism}} {{and patterns of}} rapid crack propagation and branching in carbon steel were studied on the fracture of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>vessels</b> with artificial defects under internal pressure. It was established that microscopic fracture patterns are common for model (polymethylmethacrylate) and structural (carbon steel) materials. SEM fractography shows that fracture occurs via transgranular cleavage; the lateral dimension of the crack formation zone increases along the crack path and decreases immediately before branching. A physical crack branching mechanism was proposed, based on study of patterns of single crack rapid propagation and its transition to branching mode in the model and structural materials. Crack transition from rectilinear propagation to branching occurs when its velocity V reaches its limiting value V, at which the flow of elastic strain energy entering the crack tip, G, exceeds energy G expended by the material to hold off {{the growth of the}} single crack, i. e. at G>G (necessary condition) and V=V (sufficient condition). The value of G depends on the deformation properties of the material at V V and on the sample thickness. Key words: Steel <b>Cylindrical</b> <b>vessels</b> Fracture Crack branchin...|$|R
