50|$|The {{process for}} {{bottling}} wine is largely {{similar to that}} for bottling beer, except wine bottles differ in volumes and shapes. Traditionally, a cork is used to provide closure to wine bottles. After filling, a bottle travels to a <b>corking</b> <b>machine</b> (corker) where a cork is compressed and pushed into {{the neck of the}} bottle. Whilst this is happening, the corker vacuums the air out of the bottle to form a negative pressure headspace. This removes any oxygen from the headspace, which is useful as latent oxygen can ruin the quality of the product via oxidation. A negative pressure headspace will also counteract pressure caused by the thermal expansion of the wine, preventing the cork from being forced from the bottle. Champagnes and sparkling wines may further be sealed with a muselet, which ensures the cork will not explode off in transit. Alternative wine closures such as screw caps are available.|$|E

The paper presents the dynamic modeling of a new automatic <b>corking</b> <b>machine</b> for threaded plastic caps. The model is obtained using the energy-based modeling technique named “Power-OrientedGraphs” (POG). The considered <b>corking</b> <b>machine</b> is an electromechanical system with two degrees of freedom composed by two electrical motors moving a ball screw/spline that realizes the linear/rotary motion necessary to screw a plastic cap on a bottle. The paper presents the dynamic model of the machine and the interaction between the cap and the bottle. In the paper a control algorithm is proposed. Some simulation results are presented and compared to experimental results...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is {{to show how the}} {{modeling}} of an electromechanical system can be addressed using the energy-based graphical modeling technique named “Power-Oriented Graphs” (POG). Differences and analogies of POG against Bond Graphs modeling technique are discussed. The paper presents the POG dynamic model of an automatic <b>corking</b> <b>machine</b> for threaded plastic caps: the system is composed by two electric motors moving a ball screw/spline that realizes the linear/rotary motion necessary to screw a plastic cap on a bottle. First an extended POG model is presented, together with the equivalent Bond Graph model, then some proper congruent state space transformations and a POG-based graphical method are introduced to transform and reduce the system dynamic model. Simulation and experimental results are finally presented and compared...|$|E

25|$|The {{roots of}} the modern Champagne {{industry}} were laid during the Industrial Revolution which saw vast leaps in understanding the method of making sparkling wine and improvements in the technology needed to make production more financially feasible. The French scientist Jean-Antoine Chaptal popularized the understanding that Champagne sparkled because it was sealed in a bottle before fermentation was complete. He further noted {{that it was the}} sugar in the wine that facilitated this fermentation process resulting in bubbles. Along with the bubbles came intense pressure from the carbon dioxide gas that could result in the bottles exploding. The disturbance caused by one bottle's disintegration could cause a chain reaction, with it being routine for cellars to lose 20–90% of their bottles to instability. The British method of coal fired glassmaking contributed to stronger wine bottles being available that could withstand the pressure of the carbon dioxide gas better. In the 1830s, a pharmacist from Châlons-sur-Marne named André François outlined formulas with precise measurements of how much sugar is needed to make a wine sparkle without producing more pressure than the wine bottle could withstand. <b>Corking</b> <b>machines</b> and improved <b>corks</b> made sealing the wine easier with less opportunity for the precious gas to seep out of the bottle.|$|R

Early Champagne producers chose not to remove the sediment, which left the wine cloudy and prone to off flavors if the sediment was shaken up or poured into the glass. At royal courts and banquets, servers would pour new serving of Champagne into a fresh glass to avoid the residue of sediment left over in the previous glass. To remove the sediments, some producers would decant the wine by pouring it a new bottle. However this process caused a considerable amount of carbon dioxide gas to escape and the resulting wine was noticeably less bubbly. With the aid of her cellar master, Madame Clicquot of the Champagne house Veuve Cliquot developed the process of riddling in the early 19th century {{to solve the problem of}} sediments without losing much gas. This technique, which involves collecting the sediment in the neck of the bottle and using the pressure of the wine to eject just the sediment, led to the popularity of adding sugar-sweet dosage to replace the wine lost during riddling. The Russians, in particular, were fans of very sweet Champagne and Veuve Cliquot was able to tailor the sweetness level of their wines for their customers by the composition of their dosage. At first the house of Veuve Cliquot tried to keep this technique of riddling a secret but by the late 1820s the secret was out and Champagne houses were settling up production lines for riddling. In 1854, the French national railroad system linked Reims with the rest of the country, including its coastal ports. From that point on, Champagne was connected to its worldwide market and sales grew by leaps and bounds. During the 1850s production was averaging 20 million bottles a year.|$|R
