This advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption, thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings. The Crystal Palace is the supreme example of the use of sheet glass in a new and innovative structure.|$|E

The Core Facility consists mainly of a vacuum-tight stainless steel <b>cylinder</b> (<b>Process</b> Chamber) capable of accommodating different individual Furnace Inserts (FIs), within which sample processing is carried out.

40|$|In {{reciprocating}} gas handling machinery, {{there is}} both a net or average heat transfer over many cycles between the gas and the environ-ment, and an instantaneous heat flux {{back and forth between}} the gas and the cylinder wall within each cycle. The latter phenomenon occurs both in open <b>cylinder</b> <b>processes</b> and in closed <b>cylinder</b> <b>processes,</b> where it results in what is sometimes referred to as "gas spring loss". This thesis addresses the instantaneous heat transfer as it occurs in a closed cylinder without combustion. In order to evaluate the effect of the heat transfer on the thermodynamic cycle of the gas taken as a whole, the heat transfer is spatially averaged over the boundary of the gas space. The T-S diagram, based on the mixed mean temperature and entropy of the gas, is shown to be an excellent indicator of instantaneous heat transfer process at the wall. The T-S diagram can be derived from measure-ments of pressure and volume for a fixed mass of gas, without any knowledg...|$|R

5000|$|Chance Brothers was {{amongst the}} {{earliest}} glass works {{to carry out}} the <b>cylinder</b> <b>process</b> in Europe, and the company became known as [...] "... the greatest glass manufacturer in Britain.". In 1832, it made the first British cylinder blown sheet glass using French and Belgian workers. In 1839, a further development named plate glass was patented by James Timmins Chance. In 1848 under the supervision of Georges Bontemps, a French glassmaker from Choisy-le-Roi, who had purchased the secret of the stirrer after the deaths of Pierre Louis Guinand and Joseph von Fraunhofer, the pioneers of the manufacture of high-precision lenses for observatory telescopes, a new plant was set up to manufacture crown and flint glass for lighthouse optics, telescopes and cameras. [...] Bontemps agreed to share the secret with Chance Brothers and stayed in England to collaborate with them for six years. Just three other companies in Britain made glass in the same way, Pilkington of St Helens, Hartleys of Sunderland and Cooksons of Newcastle. During 1832, Chance Brothers became the first company to adopt the cylinder method to produce sheet glass, and became the largest British manufacturer of window and plate glass, and optical glasses.|$|E

Drag reduction {{is a phenomenon}} that can have substantial energy savings, resulting in ecological and economical benefits. We use a Taylor-Couette facility as experimental instrument to measure the drag change of turbulent wall-bounded flows above modified surfaces [2, 4]. In this manuscript, we apply a riblet surface to observe the drag change compared to a smooth reference surface. Riblets are small surface protrusions which are aligned in the flow direction. They reduce drag by disturbing the spanwise motion of the flow at the surface and thereby moving turbulent vortices further {{away from the wall}} [1].

40|$|The need {{to reduce}} harmful {{emissions}} to the environment is been addressed on different fronts. Diesel engines, {{as one of the}} prime movers in transport industry, has become an active research focus for several years in order to improve their efficiency while keeping the harmful emissions the lowest possible. The inclusion of more stringent regulations and emission control areas such as NECA in the north sea demands for {{a better understanding of the}} combustion process in the cylinder in order to reduce emissions. To study such problem an approach is to regard the cylinder as a perfectly mixed volume. This concept is very simple and allows for fast calculations but it lacks the physics and the resolution necessary to study pollutants formation. The main objective of this thesis is to propose a model where the cylinder volume is divided into a few volumes, so the <b>cylinder</b> <b>process</b> can be studied in more detail and some resolution is included to calculate NO emissions. A model with three control volumes, called zones, is introduced. One zone represents the liquid fuel in the cylinder and two zones represent the gas mixture. In one of the gaseous zones the mixture preparation and combustion reaction occur; the second gaseous zone provides the oxidant to the previous zone and the combustion products are further mixed with air. The detailed model and the equations necessary to simulate the process are introduced. The required sub-models are proposed and the implementation of the complete model is done in different steps. First the liquid volume is treated and tested under a set of different conditions. In a second step the gas phase is simulated by neglecting the existence of liquid fuel in the cylinder. Finally, the complete model is assembled and NO formation mechanism is coupled with the model, testing is done allowing to evaluate the concept.
