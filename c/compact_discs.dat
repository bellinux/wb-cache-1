5|$|The {{original}} {{score for}} Final Fantasy Tactics was composed, arranged, and produced by Hitoshi Sakimoto and Masaharu Iwata. Matsuno approached his longtime friends Sakimoto and Iwata to compose the music {{soon after the}} initial release of Final Fantasy VII in January 1997. Sakimoto composed 47 tracks for the game, and Iwata was left to compose the other 24. The orchestral timbres of the game's music were synthesized, with performance by Katsutoshi Kashiwabara and sound programming by Hidenori Suzuki. The album was first released on two <b>Compact</b> <b>Discs</b> by now-defunct DigiCube on June 21, 1997, bearing the catalog number SSCX-10008, and was re-released by Square Enix on March 24, 2006, with the catalog number SQEX-10066/7.

For example, only one aria from Elgar's Dream of Gerontius, and none of her renderings of 20th century songs by Holst, Bax, Delius and others were recorded.

5|$|In 1995, Square {{showed an}} {{interactive}} SGI technical demonstration of Final Fantasy VI for the then {{next generation of}} consoles. The demonstration used Silicon Graphics's prototype Nintendo 64 workstations to create 3D graphics. Fans believed the demo was of a new Final Fantasy title for the Nintendo 64 console; however, 1997 saw the release of Final FantasyVII for the Sony PlayStation. The switch was due to a dispute with Nintendo over its use of faster but more expensive cartridges, {{as opposed to the}} slower and cheaper, but much higher capacity <b>Compact</b> <b>Discs</b> used on rival systems. Final FantasyVII introduced 3D graphics with fully pre-rendered backgrounds. It was because of this switch to 3D that a CD-ROM format was chosen over a cartridge format. The switch also led to increased production costs and a greater subdivision of the creative staff for Final FantasyVII and subsequent 3D titles in the series.|$|E
