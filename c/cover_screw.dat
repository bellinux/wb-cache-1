As compared to the negative control, CO 2 laser on dry surface, CO 2 laser+hydrogen peroxide and the positive control had statistically significant thinner fibrous capsules. As compared to the positive, only laser alone resulted in a similar tissue response. It is concluded that CO 2 laser used alone or in combination with hydrogen peroxide may be used clinically for sufficient decontamination of titanium surfaces. © Munksgaard 2000.

40|$|Background: Although {{favorable}} integration {{occurs with}} immediately loaded implants, {{the relationship between}} implant outcome, levels of occlusion, and diet requires optimization. Purpose: Pertubating load on single implant restorations immediately after placement by a hard food diet will increase the strains at the bone-implant interface, increasing the risk for failure. Materials and Methods: Forty-eight implants replaced {{the first and third}} mandibular premolars in 12 pigs, allocated into two groups based on soft- and hard-diet feeding. Cylindrical and tapered implants replaced the first and third premolars, respectively. Each animal received at random four different masticatory loading conditions (group 1 [control]: implant with either a <b>cover</b> <b>screw</b> or a healing abutment, and group 2 [test]: implant with a crown either with or without occlusal contacts). Results: Thirteen implants out of 44 failed in 11 animals (one with a <b>cover</b> <b>screw,</b> one with a healing abutment, three with nonocclusal, and eight with occlusal restorations). The failure rate of restored implants (either in occlusion or not) was significantly higher in the third premolar sites (p =. 007), although diet had no significant effect (p =. 421). Conclusions: While diet had no effect on the failure pattern of immediately loaded single implants, the position and type of load under the masticatory mode were significant. Immediately loaded implants {{both in and out of}} occlusion were less successful than the controls, and this is probably attributed to detrimental strain induced on the bone-implant interface...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Evidently, {{there is}} a {{fast-moving}} shift from delayed to immediate implant loading. The hypothesis to be tested was that bone reactions adjacent to single TiO 2 -microthreaded implants exposed to immediate masticatory loading for 10 weeks after placement would modulate osseointegration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cylindrical- and tapered-designed implants (Astra Tech AB, Mölndal, Sweden) replaced first and third mandibular premolars respectively in 12 pigs. The animals were allocated into two groups based on soft and hard diet feeding. Each animal received, at random positions, four different masticatory loading conditions: implant with either (1) a <b>cover</b> <b>screw</b> only, (2) a healing abutment, (3) an implant with a crown without occlusal contact, or (4) an implant with a crown {{in contact with the}} antagonistic teeth. RESULTS: Histomorphometry showed that there were no statistically significant differences in bone-implant contact (BIC), bone mass inside/outside of the threads and soft tissue ingrowth ratio for all the implants at 10 weeks after placement irrespective of masticatory loading condition. Bone loss showed a trend of progressive increase for implants with a healing abutment toward implants with occlusal contact.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective survey of 20 orthopantomographs with unrestored implants (only with <b>cover</b> <b>screw)</b> in the mandibular posterior region (molars and premolars) was conducted. All radiographs were taken using the same machine by skilled technicians. Two examiners were asked to measure the vertical dimension of the implants seen on the radiographs viewed using two differently sized display screens. Inter-examiner and intra-examiner reliability tests were performed. Differences between the measured length and the actual length using each screen type were compared. Results: High coefficients of reliability were observed on intra- and inter-examiner correlation. The overall reliability of measuring the vertical dimensions of implants between both examiners for the large screen and the small screen were 97. 4 % (Cronbach′s alpha 0. 993) and 94. 0 % (Cronbach′s alpha 0. 984), respectively. There were no significant differences between the errors seen with either the large screen or the small screen, when each of them was compared to the original length (P = 0. 146).

40|$|Implant-prosthetic {{rehabilitation}} {{has become}} a scientifically well-documented and commonly established treatment option in clinical management of partial and total edentulism during the last decades. Nowadays, dental osseointegrated implants are not only used for retention of removable complete or partial dentures in anatomically hampered preconditions, but gained a widespread utilisation for fixation of fixed partial dentures {{as well as for}} single tooth replacement. The prognosis of implant-borne prostheses is comparable to that of conventional prostheses. Moreover, scientifically well-evaluated and clinically established sophisticated procedures allow for development of anatomically compromised implant sites, either prior to or in conjunction with simultaneous implant placement. Nowadays, a prosthetically driven backwards planning is possible and implants can now be considered as the extension of an optimally placed prosthetic suprastructure. Since implant treatment is a complex and interdisciplinary approach, thorough treatment planning and diagnosis as well as superior patient compliance are required. Compliance, general and individual risk factors as well as chances and challenges of the planned treatment have to be considered critically and weighed against alternative treatment options prior to scheduling a patient for implant-prosthetic treatment procedures. This includes a thorough patient information as well. Internal and external evidence should be included into decision making. The purpose of this summary of selected studies on implant survival and success rates as well as on chances and risks of alveolar ridge augmentation procedures was to identify risk factors and to take them into consideration for treatment decisions. Two of the included studies identified partial exposure of the <b>cover</b> <b>screw</b> {{as well as of the}} implant surface during the unloaded healing phase of the implant osseointegration as a risk factor for implant survival and success. Premature exposure of the <b>cover</b> <b>screw</b> was found to be significantly associated with a thin crestal mucosa. Therefore, planning of incision and a smooth preparation of the soft tissue to preserve an optimal blood supply seem to be crucial. Additional risk factors as there is for example smoking should be considered critically in surgical planning. A higher rate of screw implant failures was found in the maxilla, compared to the mandible, which was discussed in context with the anatomical peculiarities of the region. This difference considering the implant site was not found when using screw-cylinder implants with a microstructured surface. Moreover, while using screw-cylinder implants, no differences were found between the survival rates of implants considered short (9 to 11 mm in length) compared to long implants (13 mm an more). Therefore, the use of short implants with a microstructured surface might be considered as treatment alternative compared to vertical alveolar ridge augmentation by bone block grafts or distraction osteogenesis prior to placement of long implants. The two included studies revealed smoking as a significant risk factor for implant survival and implant success. Implant loss was found significantly more often in smokers in the maxilla and when using short implants. These findings encouraged to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prognosis of implant-prosthetic rehabilitations in smokers compared to non-smokers. This meta-analysis revealed a significantly enhanced frequency of implant loss in smokers compared to non-smokers (implant-related odds ratio for implant loss 2. 38; patient-related odds ratio 2. 64). Frequency of implant loss was significantly enhanced in smokers undergoing augmentation procedures, compared to non-smokers (odds ratio 3. 6). Therefore, smoking should be considered a serious risk factor in therapy planning and treatment decision making as well as in patient information. This requires the identification of smokers. Questions concerning the smoking status and –quantity should be included into the general health questionnaire. However, studies with larger sample sizes and longer observation periods should be performed to evaluate, if the prognosis of dental implants with microstructured surfaces in smokers is comparable to that of non-smokers. Guided bone regeneration (GBR) of localized alveolar ridge defects utilising barrier membranes is a well-established method to augment bone prior to, or in conjunction with dental implant placement in anatomically compromised sites. A premature membrane exposure interferes with the desired result of the augmentation. When utilising membranes made of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), a premature membrane exposure to the oral environment will result in a peri-membraneous infection with a subsequent partial or total loss of the augmented hard tissue and will result in inferior esthetic and functional results. The frequency of premature membrane exposures reported in the literature ranges between 12 % to 74 % for ePTFE. Soft tissue closure above barrier membranes is a sophisticated and technically sensitive method which requires consideration of tissue thickness, blood supply, and additional anatomical peculiarities of the augmentation site. Again, smokers undergoing GBR procedures were found to have an enhanced risk of biological complications. The included study on GBR using ePTFE membranes revealed the localization of the incision line and of the barrier membrane in relation to the alveolar ridge as risk factors. In an in vivo animal study, all barrier membranes utilised were found to be suitable for augmentation procedures. However, multinuclear giant cells were found frequently around and underneath resorbable synthetic membranes made of polylactic acid and / or polyglycolic acid, which were used as alternative barrier materials compared to dense PTFE, ePTFE, polyetherurethane or microperforated titanium foils. Moreover, degradation of the synthetic resorbable barriers started 4 weeks following implantation obviously and will therefore be degraded prior to maturation of augmented hard tissue. Collagen membranes of bovine or porcine origin have recently been established as widely used resorbable barrier material. Several studies demonstrated a re-epithelialization even in large exposed areas of the membranes without significant loss of the augmented hard tissue underneath. In the presented in vivo study, collagen membranes were found to prolapse into the defect. Conclusions of the animal study suggest to overfill the defect with an augmentation material with autogenous bone, bone substitution material or combinations of both to prevent barrier membranes to prolapse into the defect. Furthermore, patients have to be informed about nature and origin of the membrane material intended to be utilised. In narrow alveolar ridges, implant placement requires the widening of the alveolar bone. Local alveolar bone spreading or osteotomy techniques might be considered as an alternative treatment option compared to GBR procedures for lateral ridge augmentation. By these procedures, the implant site is prepared without or with limited use of ablative preparation procedures (drilling), the spongious bone will be condensed and the local palatal or lingual as well as the buccal cortical plate will be spreaded and left adhered to the periosteum. Animal experiments revealed a similar osseointegration course of dental implants in sites with condensed bone subsequently to bone spreading or osteotomy procedures. Since no clinical data were available yet, a clinical study was conducted to evaluate the implant survival and success following bone spreading and osteotomy. The extent of peri-implant crestal bone resorption at different intervals following implant placement and compared to the crestal bone level at implant placement was found to be significantly correlated with the bone quality at the implant site. Implants in spongious bone with wide intertrabecular spaces revealed less peri-implant bone loss compared to implants inserted in dense spongious bone. These findings were evident following second stage surgery as well as following several intervals of prosthetic loading. Indications for utilising osteotomy technique should be considered with caution and strictly related to the bone quality evaluated at first step of implant site preparation using a pilot drill. Further implant site preparation must be adjusted to the bone quality. Implant placement in the atrophic posterior maxillary ridge requires bone tissue augmentation at the bottom of the maxillary sinus floor (sinus floor elevation and augmentation, SFEA). Since anatomical borders of the alveolar ridge are crossed with this surgical approach, a critical consideration of indication and risk factors must be performed prior to surgery. A systematic review on studies focusing on SFEA procedures revealed an implant survival rate of 92. 7 % following 5 years (retrospective studies) and 89. 5 % following 2 years of observation period (prospective studies), respectively. The nature and origin of bone augmentation materials as well as one- or two-stage procedures were not associated with the frequency of implant loss. Complications were found to be rare: the frequency range of a sinusitis was found between 3. 2 % (data from prospective studies) and 8. 2 % (retrospective studies). Again, besides occurrence of earlier sinusitis in patient history, use of implants shorter than 13 mm in length, treatment of the edentulous maxilla (compared to treatment of partially edentulous maxilla) and bruxism, smoking was identified as a significant risk factor for complications. Modern surgical procedures help to overcome anatomical limitations for prosthetic-driven implant placement. The presented studies revealed risk factors, which must be considered prior to implant-prosthetic therapy while treatment planning, patient information and with respect to alternative treatment options. Since implant-prosthetic treatment is an elective treatment option, risk factors of general health, smoking status, patient´s compliance, oral hygiene must be considered critically...|$|E

But do not fill the jar full of water; leave {{about a quarter of}} the contents in empty air, which the water may absorb, and so keep itself fresh. And any pieces of stone, or oysters, which you send up, hang by a string from the mouth, that they may not hurt tender animals by rolling about the bottom. With these simple precautions, anything which you are likely to find will well endure forty-eight hours of travel.|$|R

Below, Lee Goom and Toyama were lowering skylight <b>covers</b> and <b>screwing</b> up deadeyes. Duncan pulled shut {{the cover of the}} companion scuttle, and held on, waiting, the first drops of rain pelting his face, while the Samoset leaped violently ahead, at the same time heeling first to starboard then to port as the gusty pressures caught her winged-out sails.|$|R
