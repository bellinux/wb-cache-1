50|$|In {{a nuclear}} weapon, {{an array of}} {{explosive}} lenses is used to change the several approximately-spherical diverging detonation waves into a single spherical converging one. The converging wave is then used to collapse the various shells (tamper, reflector, pusher, etc.) and finally compresses the core (pit) of fissionable material to a prompt critical state. They are usually machined from a plastic bonded explosive and an inert insert, called a wave-shaper, which is often a dense foam or plastic, though many other materials can be used. Other, mainly older explosive lenses do not include a wave shaper, but employ two explosive types that have significantly different velocities of detonation (VoD), which {{are in the range}} from 5 to 9 km/s. The use of the low- and high-speed explosives again results in a spherical <b>converging</b> <b>detonation</b> wave to compress the physics package. The original Gadget device used in the Trinity test and Fat Man dropped on Nagasaki used Baratol as the low-VoD explosive and Composition B as the fast, but other combinations can be used.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a {{mechanism by which}} a failed deflagration of a Chandrasekharmass carbon-oxygen white dwarf can turn into a successful thermonuclear supernova explosion, without invoking an ad hoc high-density deflagration-detonation transition. Following a pulsating phase, an accretion shock develops above a core of ∼ 1 M ⊙ composed of carbon and oxygen, inducing a <b>converging</b> <b>detonation.</b> A three-dimensional simulation of the explosion produced a kinetic energy of 1. 05 × 10 51 ergs and 0. 70 M ⊙ of 56 Ni, ejecting scarcely 0. 01 M ⊙ of C-O moving at low velocities. The mechanism works under quite general conditions and is flexible enough {{to account for the}} diversity of normal Type Ia supernovae. In given conditions the detonation might not occur, which would reflect in peculiar signatures in the gamma and UV-wavelengths.

40|$|In this fluid dynamic video {{we present}} {{simulations}} of <b>converging</b> two-dimensional <b>detonation</b> in a radially expanding supersonic flow of ideal reactive gas. The detonation {{is found to}} be unstable and leads to formation of characteristic cellular patterns. Without any obstacles in the flow, the detonation keeps expanding radially. To retain the wave within a bounded region, we place a number of rigid obstacles in the flow so that the detonation shock stands some distance toward the center from the obstacles. This leads to generation of reflected shock waves from the obstacles which help the detonation wave to remain at a finite distance from the source. The cellular structure of detonation creates beautiful patterns of shock waves and contact discontinuities within and after the reaction zone. The patterns often resemble a sunflower, hence the name of "sunflower detonation"...|$|R

ABSTRACT (Continue on reverse if noceaaary and {{identify}} by block number) In this f inal report a summary is given {{of the research}} performed under the Sponsorship Of AFOSR grant nuniberApDSR- 86 - 0218. In addition this reprt includes a Preprint of a paper entitled "The existence and behavior of viscous structure for plane detonation waves. " The abstract of this paper follows. "We prove a necessary condition and a sufficient condition {{for the existence of}} steady lane wave solutins to the Navier Stokes equations for a reacting gas. These solutions represent plane <b>detonation</b> waves, and <b>converge</b> to ZND <b>detonation</b> waves as the viscosity, eat conductivity, and species diffusion rates tend to zero. We assume that the Pradtl titr is 3 / 4, but we permit arbitrary Lewis numbers. We make no assumrption concerning the activation energy.
