50|$|Perchloromethyl {{mercaptan}} is the organosulfur compound {{with the}} formula CCl3SCl. It is mainly {{used as an}} intermediate for the synthesis of dyes and fungicides (<b>captan,</b> <b>folpet).</b> It is a colorless oil, although commercial samples are yellowish. It is insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents. It has a foul, unbearable, acrid odor. Perchloromethyl mercaptan is the original name. The most common name is trichloromethanesulfenyl chloride, because the compound is a sulfenyl chloride, not a mercaptan.|$|E
40|$|<b>Captan</b> and <b>folpet</b> are two {{fungicides}} largely used in agriculture, but biomonitoring {{data are}} mostly limited to measurements of captan metabolite concentrations in spot urine samples of workers, which complicate {{interpretation of results}} in terms of internal dose estimation, daily variations according to tasks performed, and most plausible routes of exposure. This study aimed at performing repeated biological measurements of exposure to <b>captan</b> and <b>folpet</b> in field workers (i) to better assess internal dose along with main routes-of-entry according to tasks and (ii) to establish most appropriate sampling and analysis strategies. The detailed urinary excretion time courses of specific and non-specific biomarkers of exposure to <b>captan</b> and <b>folpet</b> were established in tree farmers (n = 2) and grape growers (n = 3) over a typical workweek (seven consecutive days), including spraying and harvest activities. The impact of the expression of urinary measurements [excretion rate values adjusted or not for creatinine or cumulative amounts over given time periods (8, 12, and 24 h) ] was evaluated. Absorbed doses and main routes-of-entry were then estimated from the 24 -h cumulative urinary amounts {{through the use of}} a kinetic model. The time courses showed that exposure levels were higher during spraying than harvest activities. Model simulations also suggest a limited absorption in the studied workers and an exposure mostly through the dermal route. It further pointed out the advantage of expressing biomarker values in terms of body weight-adjusted amounts in repeated 24 -h urine collections as compared to concentrations or excretion rates in spot samples, without the necessity for creatinine correction...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the stage of bacterial growth of the over-night culture on captan- and folpet-induced reversion in the Ames test was investigated. Tests were performed {{in order to determine}} both the number of viable bacteria at different intervals of bacterial growth-in {{the presence or absence of}} captan and folpet-and also the number of revertants. <b>Captan</b> or <b>folpet</b> were tested at 5 ¡tg per plate, a concentration which had previously showed a mutagenic effect to the TA 100 strain. The highest induced reversion was obtained when the bacterial culture used had entered the stationary-phase after 10 - 14 h, with a titre of at least 108 viable cells per mI...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{indiscriminate}} {{use of pesticides}} on grape crops is harmful for consumers´ healthin “in natura” consumption and in the ingestion of wine and grape juice. During winemaking, a rapid and efficient fermentation stage is critical to avoid proliferation of contaminating microorganisms and to guarantee the product´s quality. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) {{has the advantage of}} detecting these contaminants {{in the early stages of}} fermentation. However,this enzymatic reaction may also be susceptible to specific problems, reducing its efficiency. Agricultural practices, such as fungicide treatments, may be a source of PCR inhibiting factors and may also interfere in the normal course of fermentation. The action of the pesticides <b>captan</b> and <b>folpet</b> on PCR and on yeast metabolism was evaluated, once these phthalimide compounds are widely employed in Brazilian vineyards. DNA amplification was only observed at 75 and 37. 5 µg/mL of captan concentrations, whereas with folpet, amplification was observed only in the two lowest concentrations tested (42. 2 and 21. 1 µg/mL). Besides the strong inhibition on Taq polymerase activity, phthalimides also inhibited yeast metabolism at all concentrations analyzed. Grape must containing <b>captan</b> and <b>folpet</b> residues could not be transformed into wine due to stuck fermentation caused by the inhibition of yeast metabolism. Non-compliance with the waiting period for phthalimide fungicides may result in financial liabilities to the viticulture sector. The use of yeasts with high fungicide sensitivity should be selected for must fermentation as a strategy for sustainable wine production and to assure that products comply with health and food safety standards...|$|R
40|$|<b>Captan</b> and <b>folpet</b> are {{fungicides}} largely used in agriculture. They {{have similar}} chemical structures, except that folpet has an aromatic ring unlike captan. Their half-lives in blood are very short, given {{that they are}} readily broken down to tetrahydrophthalimide (THPI) and phthalimide (PI), respectively. Few authors measured these biomarkers in plasma or urine, and analysis was conducted either by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography with UV detection. The objective {{of this study was}} thus to develop simple, sensitive and specific liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/APCI-MS/MS) methods to quantify both THPI and PI in human plasma and urine. Briefly, deuterated THPI was added as an internal standard and purification was performed by solid-phase extraction followed by LC/APCI-MS/MS analysis in negative ion mode for both compounds. Validation of the methods was conducted using spiked blank plasma and urine samples at concentrations ranging from 1 to 250 μg/L and 1 to 50 μg/L, respectively, along with samples of volunteers and workers exposed to <b>captan</b> or <b>folpet.</b> The methods showed a good linearity (R (2) [*]> 0. 99), recovery (on average 90 % for THPI and 75 % for PI), intra- and inter-day precision (RSD, < 15 %) and accuracy (< 20 %), and stability. The limit of detection was 0. 58 μg/L in urine and 1. 47 μg/L in plasma for THPI and 1. 14 and 2. 17 μg/L, respectively, for PI. The described methods proved to be accurate and suitable to determine the toxicokinetics of both metabolites in human plasma and urine...|$|R
40|$|The time {{courses of}} key {{biomarkers}} {{of exposure to}} <b>captan</b> and <b>folpet</b> was assessed in accessible biological matrices of orally exposed volunteers. Ten volunteers ingested 1 [*]mg kg(- 1) body weight of <b>captan</b> or <b>folpet.</b> Blood samples were withdrawn at fixed time periods over the 72 [*]h following ingestion and complete urine voids were collected over 96 [*]h post-dosing. The tetrahydrophthalimide (THPI) metabolite of captan along with the phthalimide (PI) and phthalic acid metabolites of folpet were then quantified in these samples. Plasma levels of THPI and PI increased progressively after ingestion, reaching peak values ~ 10 and 6 [*]h post-dosing, respectively; subsequent elimination phase appeared monophasic with a mean elimination half-life (t(½)) of 15. 7 and 31. 5 [*]h, respectively. In urine, elimination rate time courses of PI and phthalic acid evolved in parallel, with respective t(½) of 27. 3 and 27. 6 [*]h; relatively faster elimination was found for THPI, with mean t(½) of 11. 7 [*]h. However, phthalic acid was present in urine in 1000 -fold higher amounts than PI. In the 96 [*]h period post-treatment, on average 25 % of folpet dose was excreted in urine as phthalic acid as compared with only 0. 02 % as PI. The corresponding value for THPI was 3. 5 %. Overall, THPI and PI appear as interesting biomarkers of recent exposure, with relatively short half-lives; their sensitivity to assess exposure in field studies should be further verified. Although not a metabolite specific to folpet, the concomitant use of phthalic acid as a major biomarker of exposure to folpet should also be considered. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|To better assess {{biomonitoring}} data in workers {{exposed to}} <b>captan</b> and <b>folpet,</b> the kinetics of ring metabolites [tetrahydrophthalimide (THPI), phthalimide (PI) and phthalic acid] were determined in urine and plasma of dermally exposed volunteers. A 10 [*] mg kg(- 1) dose of each fungicide was applied on 80 [*]cm(2) of the forearm and left without occlusion or washing for 24 [*]h. Blood samples were withdrawn at fixed time periods over the 72 [*] h following application and complete urine voids were collected over 96 [*]h post-dosing, for metabolite analysis. In the hours following treatment, a progressive increase in plasma levels of THPI and PI was observed, with peak levels being reached at 24 [*]h for THPI and 10 [*]h for PI. The ensuing elimination phase appeared monophasic {{with a mean}} elimination half-life (t(½)) of 24. 7 and 29. 7 [*]h for THPI and PI, respectively. In urine, time courses PI and phthalic acid excretion rate rapidly evolved in parallel, and a mean elimination t(½) of 28. 8 and 29. 6 [*]h, respectively, was calculated from these curves. THPI was eliminated slightly faster, with a mean t(½) of 18. 7 [*]h. Over the 96 [*] h period post-application, metabolites were almost completely excreted, and on average 0. 02 % of captan dose was recovered in urine as THPI while 1. 8 % of the folpet dose was excreted as phthalic acid and 0. 002 % as PI, suggesting a low dermal absorption fraction for both fungicides. This study showed the potential use of THPI, PI and phthalic acid as key biomarkers of exposure to <b>captan</b> and <b>folpet...</b>|$|R
40|$|A multiresidue gas chromatographic {{method for}} the {{determination}} of six fungicides (<b>captan,</b> chlorthalonil, <b>folpet,</b> iprodione, procymidone and vinclozolin) and one acaricide (dicofol) in still and fortified wines was developed. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) was chosen for the extraction of the compounds from the studied matrices and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) detection was used. The extraction consists in a solvent free and automated procedure and the detection is highly sensitive and selective. Good linearity was obtained with correlation coefficients of regression (R 2) > 0. 99 for all the compounds. Satisfactory results of repeatability and intermediate precision were obtained {{for most of the}} analytes (RSD < 20 %). Recoveries from spiked wine ranged from 80. 1 % to 112. 0 %. Limits of quantification (LOQs) were considerably below the proposedmaximumresidue limits (MRLs) for these compounds in grapes and below the suggested limits for wine (MRLs/ 10), with the exception of captan...|$|R
5000|$|Captan was {{previously}} cited as Group B2, a probable human carcinogen by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but was reclassified in 2004. Since {{the mode of}} action has been established as a proliferative response (in mice only) after intestinal villi are disrupted, captan has been deemed not likely to cause tumors at doses that do not irritate the intestine. The EPA now states, [...] "The new cancer classification considers captan to be a potential carcinogen at prolonged high doses that cause cytotoxicity and regenerative cell hyperplasia. These high doses of captan are many orders of magnitude above those likely to be consumed in the diet, or encountered by individuals in occupational or residential settings. Therefore, captan {{is not likely to}} be a human carcinogen nor pose cancer risks of concern when used in accordance with approved product labels. A similar reclassification has been made for folpet, captan's sister fungicide, which shares a common mechanism of toxicity. A key finding for <b>captan</b> (and <b>folpet)</b> is these fungicides are not mutagenic in vivo; that is, they are not mutagenic in the intact animal.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the gas phase thermal decomposition of captafol, a sulfenimide fungicide which consists of a thiotetrachloroethyl (-SCCl 2 CHCl 2) group bonded to a tetrahydrophthalimide (C 6 H 8 (CO) 2 N-) moiety. The experiments were performed on a bench type apparatus, under conditions representing both under and well-ventilated non-flaming fires. The analyses of gaseous species relied on Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) and micro gas chromatography (μGC), resulting in the identification and quantification of 11 gaseous products; among them, phosgene, thiophosgene and hydrogen cyanide. Gas chromatography - quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-QMS) was employed to analyse the condensed products and volatile organic compounds (VOC), while a GC equipped with an ion trap mass spectrometer (GC-ITMS) was used to quantify polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F). The GC-QMS analysis determined several VOC toxicants; viz., trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, benzonitrile and chlorinated benzenes. At higher temperature (600 °C), the oxidation of captafol {{led to the formation of}} mono- to hepta- CDD/F congeners including the most toxic 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD. In addition, the experimental results were compared to those of the other two sulfenimide fungicides, <b>captan</b> and <b>folpet,</b> both of which contain the thiotrichloromethyl (-SCCl 3) moiety rather than the thiotetrachloroethyl group of captafol. It appears that the thiotetrachloroethyl group in captafol is responsible for the difference in the toxic pollutants formed, particularly influencing the distribution and yields of PCDD/F congeners. Combined with quantum chemical calculations, the results presented in this article provide an insightful understanding of fire chemistry of the sulfenimide fungicides, especially the pathways to the formation of major toxicants during the oxidative thermal decomposition of captafol...|$|R
