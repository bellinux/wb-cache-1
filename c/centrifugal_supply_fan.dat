Direct expansion (DX) air conditioning (A/C) units are commonly used for environmental control in small- to medium-scaled buildings. This paper reports on an experimental study to investigate the indoor thermal comfort characteristics {{under the control of}} a DX A/C unit having variable-speed compressor and <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> at a fixed space cooling load but having three different ratios between its sensible part and latent part. The experimental results suggested that under a fixed indoor total cooling load with three different space sensible heat ratios (SHRs) of 0. 92, 0. 72 and 0. 62, varying both speeds of compressor and <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> in the DX A/C unit would influence indoor thermal comfort. Furthermore, when a DX A/C unit having variable-speed compressor and <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> is used for indoor thermal comfort control under abnormal indoor load conditions, its ability of indoor thermal comfort control through varying compressor speed and <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> speed may be duly restricted.

40|$|For {{residential}} buildings {{located in the}} subtropics, direct expansion (DX) air conditioning (A/C) units are commonly used. Most DX A/C units are currently equipped with single-speed compressors and <b>supply</b> <b>fans,</b> relying on on-off cycling compressors as a low-cost approach to maintain only indoor air dry-bulb temperature, resulting in either space overcooling or an uncontrolled equilibrium indoor relative humidity (RH) level. With the rapid development of A/C industry, the use of variable-speed compressor and <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> has {{become more and more}} prevalent and practical. This paper, the first part of a two-part series, reports on the development of a novel direct digital control (DDC) -based capacity controller for a DX A/C unit having variable-speed compressor and <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> to simultaneously control indoor air temperature and RH in a conditioned space served by the DX A/C unit. The controller is {{the first of its kind}} as a composite parameter, sensible heat ratio (SHR), is used as a controlled parameter. The core element of the capacity controller, a numerical calculation algorithm (NCA) is firstly presented. This is followed by reporting the results of preliminary controllability tests of the DDC-based capacity controller, which suggested that the controller developed could achieve a reasonable control accuracy, but with room for improvement with respect to control sensitivity. Part II of the two-part series reports on the further development of the controller to improve its control sensitivity, and the results of associated controllability tests.

This would impact the operating efficiency and stability of the DX A/C system. Therefore a new DS controller, which was intended for improving the DS control performance when the fluctuation of operating DS was resulted from speed changes, has been developed and its controllability tested. The test results showed that this new DS controller, which replaced the conventional PID DS controller, can significantly improve DS control performance after speed changes while indoor air temperature and humidity were controlled to their respective settings. With the improved DS control performance, the operating efficiency and stability of the DX A/Csystem were also enhanced. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|An {{artificial}} {{neural network}} (ANN) -based dynamic model for an experimental variable speed direct expansion (DX) air conditioning (A/C) system has been developed, linking the indoor air temperature and humidity controlled by the DX A/C system with the variations of compressor and <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> speeds. The values of average relative error (ARE) and maximum relative error (MRE) when validating the ANN-based dynamic model developed under three different input patterns were 0. 33 %, 0. 27 %, 0. 27 % and 0. 89 %, 0. 99 %, 1. 15 %, respectively, indicating the high accuracy of the ANN-based dynamic model developed. An ANN-based controller was then developed for controlling the indoor air temperature and humidity simultaneously by varying the compressor speed and <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> speed in a space served by the experimental DX A/C system.

40|$|The {{instability}} in a refrigeration system, conventionally known as hunting, is the phenomena of the oscillation of certain system operational parameters {{such as the}} degree of refrigerant superheat (DS), refrigerant mass flow rate and evaporating pressure. Hunting has been noticed in not only the refrigeration systems controlled by thermostatic expansion valves (TEVs), but also those controlled by electronic expansion valves (EEVs), and hence attracted {{a lot of research}} interest. However, no previous studies on the impacts of both the operational parameters of an EEV and the simultaneous variation of compressor and <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> speed in a variable speed (VS) direct expansion (DX) air conditioning (A/C) system may be identified. Â This paper reports on a modeling study on the operational stability of a VS DX A/C system. An existing detailed, physical based dynamic model for a VS DX A/C system has been further developed by adding equations for both the temperature sensor in an EEV and the air side of the evaporator. Using this further developed model, a modeling study on the stability of a VS DX A/C system based on the classical minimal-stable-signal (MSS) theory has been carried out. The effects of the dynamics of the temperature sensor, Proportional-Integral (PI) control settings of the EEV and variable speed operation of both compressor and <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> on the operational stability of the VS DX A/C system have been investigated. The modelling results demonstrated that increasing the time constant of the temperature sensor would help mitigating the system instability, and increasing the compressor speed or decreasing the <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> speed would lead to the movement of a mixture-vapor transition point towards evaporator exit, leading to potential instability of the VS DX A/C system. ...|$|R

40|$|Controlling indoor {{humidity}} at {{an appropriate}} level {{is very important}} since this affects occupants' thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ). The paper presents an investigation on developing a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) control strategy for simultaneously controlling the indoor air temperature and humidity by varying the speeds of both compressor and <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> in an experimental DX A/C system. The MIMO-based controller was designed based on the linearized dynamic model of the experimental DX A/C system. The Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) technique was used in designing the MIMO-based controller. The controllability tests with respect to both the disturbance rejection capability and the command following capability were carried out to assess the control performance of MIMO controller. The results of disturbance rejection capability test showed that the MIMO control strategy can effectively maintain the indoor air temperature and humidity to their respective settings after an unmeasured heat load disturbance was imposed by simultaneously varying speeds of both the compressor and the <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> of the DX A/C system. Furthermore, in the command following capability test for indoor air temperature, the test {{results showed that the}} indoor air temperature can be controlled to its new setting while indoor humidity remained unchanged. Similar test results were also observed in the command following capability test for indoor humidity. Therefore, the MIMO controller developed can effectively control indoor air temperature and humidity simultaneously by varying compressor speed and <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> speed of the DX A/C system. Compared to the previous related studies using conventional on-off control method or single-input single-output (SISO) control strategy, which can only effectively control either air temperature or relative humidity, the MIMO controller can simultaneously control the indoor air temperature and humidity with adequate control sensitivity and accuracy. The application of MIMO control strategy developed can be extended to other HVAC systems in the future to improve their operating performance and energy efficiency.

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the {{inherent}} operational characteristics of a variable speed (VS) direct expansion (DX) air conditioning (A/C) system at a fixed degree of refrigerant superheat (DS) setting without considering its operational stability have been conducted. Therefore, a follow-up study on the inherent operational characteristics of a VS DX A/C system considering its operational stability {{has been carried out}} and the study results are reported. Using an experimental VS DX A/C system, the inherent correlations between its output total cooling capacity (TCC) and equipment sensible heat ratio (E SHR) at different combinations of compressor speed and <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> speed were studied and the unstable operating points of speed combinations under different DS settings and inlet air states identified. The experimental results suggested while different DS settings may not significantly influence the inherent correlations between TCC and E SHR, but did impact the operational stability. A lower DS setting would result in a larger unstable operating region. Furthermore, VS operation and different inlet air states to the DX evaporator also influenced the operational stability. A higher compressor speed or a lower <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> speed, and a lower inlet air temperature or relative humidity would lead to a higher chance to instability.

An ANN-based model having the configuration of 2 neurons in the input layer, 2 neurons in the output layer and 6 neurons {{in each of the}} 2 hidden layers, i. e. 2 - 6 - 6 - 2 configuration, was thus developed. The ANN-based model developed can be used to predict the operating performance of the DX A/C system with a higher accuracy.
