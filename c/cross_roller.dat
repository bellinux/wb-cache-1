40|$|Bearings are {{essential}} parts used in machine tools where high precision is required. It {{is important to}} understand bearing failure in order to replace a bearing before it affects the quality of precision. Bearing failure appears as a run-out in some applications, which is a critical factor for precision. However, previous studies have only focused on failure mechanisms, such as spalling. In this study, two types of wear models were used to predict the thrust bearings run-out: Linear and non-linear mechanisms. In order to validate the models, wear experiments of <b>cross</b> <b>roller</b> thrust bearings were performed. The average difference between the experiment and simulation run-out result was 16 %. Then, the wear of different sized <b>cross</b> <b>roller</b> bearings was predicted by using a simulation. This was compared with the experiment result and showed up to a 6 % difference. The suggested wear models are expected to be used to predict the failure/life of bearings...|$|E
50|$|This type of rotary stage {{includes}} {{ball bearing}} stages, <b>crossed</b> <b>roller</b> bearing stages, and possibly others. Any {{of a number}} of different rolling-element bearings may be employed. Typically, a pair of bearings is used and they are preloaded to take up any slack which could result in the stage platform lifting relative to the base.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} <b>crossed</b> <b>roller</b> slides, roller slides are non-motorized linear slides that provide low-friction linear {{movement}} for equipment powered by inertia or by hand. Roller slides {{are based on}} linear roller bearings, which are frequently criss-crossed to provide heavier load capabilities and better movement control. Serving industries such as manufacturing, photonics, medical and telecommunications, roller slides are versatile and can be adjusted to meet numerous applications which typically include clean rooms, vacuum environments, material handling and automation machinery.|$|R
50|$|A wire race bearing is a rolling-element bearing, {{where the}} balls or rollers run on races {{resembling}} loops of wire. Roller bearings may use just two races, but ball bearings typically use {{three or four}} races. Wire race bearings can be large yet lightweight and with small profile and good precision. Wire races have little intrinsic structure and must be adequately supported by the bearing housing. Balls, <b>rollers</b> or even <b>cross</b> <b>rollers</b> are used as rolling elements. Due to the design wire race bearings are commonly called '4-point-contact' bearings.|$|R

An example shows that the bearing’s life is improved significantly by the optimization. It indicates that the optimization design has some guidance significance in the design process of the slewing bearing...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} calculate the energy balance under consideration of variable technological parameters which allows to calculate the energetic behaviour of a hydraulic drive {{by means of the}} state variables supplied by dynamic simulation. In this method, the energetic behaviour of a hydraulic drive can be determined by means of the state variables supplied by dynamic simulation. A <b>cross</b> <b>roller</b> drive is investigated as an example for use. Hereby, a really available drive is analyzed according to functionality and energy balance in comparison with alternative drive variants. All variants are compared and evaluated. To evaluate the drives' energetic behaviour, there are considered the magnitude of power dissipation and the efficiency in various working cycles and technological parameters...|$|E
40|$|The digital {{revolution}} has fundamentally changed our lives by giving us {{new ways to}} express ourselves through digital media. For example, accessible multimedia content creation tools allow people to instantiate their ideas and share them easily. However, most of these outcomes only exist on-screen and online. Despite the growing accessibility of digital design and fabrication tools the physical world and everyday objects surrounding us have been largely excluded from a parallel explosion of possibilities to express ourselves. Increasingly, webbased services allow professional and non-professional audiences to access computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) tools like 3 D-printing and laser-cutting. Nonetheless, there are few (if any) design tools and methods for creating complex mechanical assemblies that {{take full advantage of}} CAM systems. Creating unique mechatronic artifacts or "originalMachines" requires more specific and sophisticated design tools than exist today. "Object-Oriented Mechatronics" is a parametric design approach that connects knowledge about mechanical assemblies and electronics with the requirements of digital manufacturing processes. Parametric instances like gears, bearing and servos are made available as objects within a CAD environment which can then be implemented into specific projects. The approach addresses the missing link between accessible rapid-manufacturing services and currently available design tools thereby creating new opportunities for self-expression through mechatronic objects and machines. The dissertation matches mechanical components and assemblies with rapid manufacturing methods by exploring transferability of conventional manufacturing techniques to appropriate rapid manufacturing tools. I rebuild various gearing and bearing principles like four-contact point bearings, <b>cross</b> <b>roller</b> bearings, spur and helical gears, planetary gears, cycloidal and harmonic gear reducers using the laser cutter, the CNC-mill and the 3 D-printer. These explorations lead to more complex assemblies such as the PlywoodServo, 3 DprintedClock and 3 -DoF (Degree of Freedom) Head. The lessons from these explorations are summarized in a detailed "cook book" of novel mechatronic assemblies enabled by new fabrication tools. Furthermore, I use the results to develop a CAD tool that brings together several existing software packages and plug-ins including Rhino, Grasshopper and the Firefly experiments for Arduino, which will allow animation, fabrication and control of original machines. The tool is an example of an object-oriented design approach to mechatronic assemblies. A user calls a DoF (Degree of Freedom) object (parametric servo) with specific parameters like gearing and bearing types, motor options and control and communication capabilities. The DoF object then creates the corresponding geometry which can be connected and integrated with other actuators and forms. A group of roboticists and designers participated in a workshop to test the tool and make proposals for original machines using the tool. The dissertation has contributions on multiple levels. First, the actuator assembly examples and parametric design tool present a body of novel work that illustrates the benefits of going beyond off-the-shelf actuator assemblies and kit-of-parts for robotic objects. Second, this tool and the accompanying examples enable the design of more original machines with custom actuator assemblies using the latest digital fabrication tools. Finally, these explorations illustrate how new CAD/ CAM tools can facilitate an exchange between more design-oriented users and more engineering-oriented users. by Peter Schmitt. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|A {{compact and}} {{lightweight}} mechanism has been developed to accurately move a Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) scan mirror (a cube corner) in a near-linear fashion with near constant speed at cryogenic temperatures. This innovation includes a slide mechanism to restrict motion to one dimension, an actuator to drive the motion, and a linear velocity transducer (LVT) to measure the speed. The cube corner mirror is double-passed in one arm of the FTS; double-passing is required to compensate for optical beam shear resulting from tilting of the moving cube corner. The slide, actuator, and LVT are off-the-shelf components {{that are capable of}} cryogenic vacuum operation. The actuator drives the slide for the required travel of 2. 5 cm. The LVT measures translation speed. A proportional feedback loop compares the LVT voltage with the set voltage (speed) to derive an error signal to drive the actuator and achieve near constant speed. When the end of the scan is reached, a personal computer reverses the set voltage. The actuator and LVT have no moving parts in contact, and have magnetic properties consistent with cryogenic operation. The unlubricated slide restricts motion to linear travel, using <b>crossed</b> <b>roller</b> bearings consistent with 100 -million- stroke operation. The mechanism tilts several arc seconds during transport of the FTS mirror, which would compromise optical fringe efficiency when using a flat mirror. Consequently, a cube corner mirror is used, which converts a tilt into a shear. The sheared beam strikes (at normal incidence) a flat mirror {{at the end of the}} FTS arm with the moving mechanism, thereby returning upon itself and compensating for the shea...|$|R

25|$|A {{swaging machine}} works by using two or four split dies which {{separate}} and close up to 2000 times a minute. This action {{is achieved by}} mounting the dies into the machine's spindle which is rotated by a motor. The spindle is mounted inside a cage containing rollers (looks like a roller bearing). The rollers are larger than the cage so as the spindle spins the dies are pushed out to ride on the cage by centrifugal force, as the dies <b>cross</b> over the <b>rollers</b> they push the dies together because of their larger size. On a four-die machine, the number of rollers cause all dies to close at a time; {{if the number of}} rollers do not cause all pairs of dies to close at the same time then the machine is called a rotary forging machine, even though it is still a swaging process.|$|R

The drum gear coupling effect on the roller system stability and the automatic balance conditions of the coupling transmission torque were studied; the influence of axial force caused by the <b>roller</b> <b>cross</b> on the system stability was analyzed. Finally, the roller transverse friction chatter vibration mechanics model was established; the simulation analysis was carried out with eliminating mill house-bearing clearance and adding floating support for coupling, respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the study presented in this report was to document {{the launch of the}} Iowa River Bridge and to monitor and evaluate the structural performance of the bridge superstructure and substructure during the launch. The Iowa Department of Transportation used an incremental launching method, which is relatively unique for steel I-girder bridges, to construct the Iowa River Bridge over an environmentally sensitive river valley in central Iowa. The bridge was designed as two separate roadways consisting of four steel plate girders each that are approximately 11 ft deep and span approximately 301 ft each over five spans. The concrete bridge deck was not placed until after both roadways had been launched. One of the most significant monitoring and evaluation observations related to the superstructure was that the bottom flange (and associated web region) was subjected to extremely large stresses during the <b>crossing</b> of launch <b>rollers.</b> Regarding the substructure performance, the column stresses did not exceed reasonable design limits during the daylong launches. The scope of the study did not allow adequate quantification of the measured applied launch forces at the piers. Future proposed esearch should provide an opportunity to address this. The overall experimental performance of the bridge during the launch was compared with the predicted design performance. In general, the substructure design, girder contact stress, and total launching force assumptions correlated well with the experimental results. The design assumptions for total axial force in crossframe members, on the other hand, differed from the experimental results by as much as 300...|$|R
