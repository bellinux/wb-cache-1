5000|$|Daechi-dong was {{developed}} by the Gangnam development policy in the early 1970s. There are two main reasons why the government promoted the Gangnam development policy. The first reason is that the increase of population in Seoul is so large that the existing large cities could not cope with the influx of population into Seoul. And the second reason is {{that it is difficult to}} evacuate people in the northern Han river when a war similar to the Korean War occurs.So the government built a bridge in the Han river near Gangnam and made the Gyeongbu Expressway, which is the highway that run from Busan to Gangnam. As a result, land prices in Gangnam rose 15 times bigger in that year. However, since Gangnam did not have the necessary facilities to live, the migration to Gangnam, which the government wanted, was very slow. Therefore, the government relocated Seoul City Hall and various government offices to Gangnam, and moved the prestigious high schools in Gangbuk to Gangnam. The government also moved Seoul University and other universities to Gangnam.

This resulted a huge shift of hagwons to Gangnam.http://www.lh.or.kr/http://www.mediatoday.co.kr/?mod=news&act=articleView&idxno=130150http://www.bookpot.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=273http://scholar.dkyobobook.co.kr/searchDetail.laf?barcode=4010017043877https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ED%95%9C%EB%82%A8%EB%8C%80%EA%B5%90 ...|$|E
40|$|Nearly {{seven years}} have passed since the last {{recession}} ended in November 2001. That recession was characterized by an unwinding of excess business investment {{in the aftermath of a}} burst U. S. stock market bubble (see Lansing 2003 a). During the early years of the recovery, an accommodative interest rate environment provided stimulus to the housing market. To keep initial monthly payments affordable for the large influx of new and often <b>credit-impaired</b> homebuyers, the lending industry marketed a range of “exotic ” mortgage products, for example, loans requiring no down payment or documentation of income, monthly payments for interest-only or less, and adjustable rate mortgages with low introductory “teaser ” rates that reset higher over time.
