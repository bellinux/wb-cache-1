IRM typically integrates with content management system software but corporations such as Samsung Electronics also develop their own custom DRM systems.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{the authors}} {{investigate}} <b>consumers?</b> consideration of <b>media</b> channels during different usage situations. They develop {{a model that}} explains <b>consumers?</b> <b>media</b> channel consideration {{as a function of}} the media channel?s perceived benefits. In addition, they hypothesize that the usage situation affects <b>consumers?</b> <b>media</b> channel consideration and that situation-based benefit requirements moderate the effect of the benefits on their channel consideration. The authors test the hypothesized relationships using survey data from 341 consumers regarding their consideration of 12 different media channels used by manufacturers to communicate product information across three product-related usage situations. The results of the analyses support the proposed model structure and confirm the expected relationships among perceived media channel benefits, usage situations, media channel requirements, and <b>consumers?</b> <b>media</b> channel consideration. ...|$|R

40|$|Executive summary Purpose: Current {{research}} [1] {{compared the}} differences in terms of perception of trustworthiness and emotional appeal of traditional and <b>consumer</b> generated marketing <b>media</b> and [2] evaluated the correlation between factors of the recently developed relationship communication framework (Finne & Grönroos, 2009) with the perception of a marketing action by actual customers of a firm, to see whether these factors {{should be considered in}} firm’s marketing communication strategy. Additionally, the researchers compared the correlations between traditional and <b>consumer</b> generated <b>media</b> types to the relationship communication factors, effectively combining the two researched subjects.         Design and execution: The research utilized quantitative research approach relying on simple random sampling technique within fitness and recreational settings.   Findings/Implications: Data analysis confirmed that there is a consistent difference between traditional and <b>consumer</b> generated <b>media</b> in terms of perception of trustworthiness and partial and not consistent difference in terms of emotional appeal. Mild correlation between consumer unique factors of relationship communication framework (Finne & Grönroos, 2009) and perception of the marketing action have been confirmed, with these correlations remaining consistent between traditional and <b>consumer</b> generated <b>media.</b> The findings suggest that traditional and <b>consumer</b> generated <b>media</b> have varying impacts on consumer’s perception of marketing action and that incorporating consumer unique factors of relationship communication framework (Finne & Grönroos, 2009) in marketing communication strategy may benefit the firm in relationship building and integrated marketing communication...|$|R

40|$|This article {{goes beyond}} the {{principle}} of relative constancy (PRC) by testing 2 new models of <b>consumer</b> mass <b>media</b> spending using 1953 - 1991 Belgian data. Unlike traditional PRC models, which have focused exclusively on the long-term relationship between income and mass media spending, these 2 models contain additional regressors (price, population, unemployment, and interest rate) in current (Model 1) and lagged (Model 2) form. Time-series regression analyses were performed to determine which variables significantly predict changes in <b>consumer</b> mass <b>media</b> expenditures. Model 1 regressions revealed that price and population were better predictors of mass media expenditures than income, stressing the importance of developing models of <b>consumer</b> mass <b>media</b> spending that go beyond a simple mass media expenditures-income relation. Model 2 regressions showed that lagged variables {{played an important role}} in explaining changes in mass media expenditures, indicating the need for incorporating lags in future mass media spending work. ...|$|R

Loss aversion is a well documented aspect of human behavior. Economists have theories of rational information consumption and investment that do {{not account for the}} commonly observed media choices of typical <b>media</b> <b>consumers.</b> By integrating loss-aversion into the model of informational choices, we are able to explain many of the commonly observed patterns in media consumption. For example, <b>media</b> <b>consumers</b> show preference for media outlets that report "dramatic" events that have little real affects on the lives of most viewers. Additionally, <b>media</b> <b>consumers</b> tend to prefer outlets that confirm pre-existing biases the consumer holds. The explorations in information consumption in consideration of loss aversion, provide a basis for interpreting these common observations...|$|R
