When the family patriarch, Pancho Duque, is offered a lucrative but questionable deal by his bitter adversaries, the Samuels, he is faced with a difficult choice: Should he <b>cash</b> <b>out</b> of the sugar business and focus solely on rum, which would please his biological son, Frank Duque?

25|$|Future {{contracts}} are another way our farmer can hedge his risk without {{a few of}} the risks that forward contracts have. Future {{contracts are}} similar to forward contracts except they are more standardized (i.e. each contract is the same quantity and date for everyone). These contracts trade on exchanges and are guaranteed through clearinghouses. Clearinghouses ensure that every contract is honored and they take the opposite side of every contract. Future contracts typically are more liquid than forward contracts and move with the market. Because of this, the farmer can minimize the risk he faces in the future through the selling of future contracts. Future contracts also differ from forward contracts in that delivery never happens. The exchanges and clearinghouses allow the buyer or seller to leave the contract early and <b>cash</b> <b>out.</b> So tying back into the farmer selling his wheat at a future date, he will sell short futures contracts for the amount that he predicts to harvest to protect against a price decrease. The current (spot) price of wheat and the price of the futures contracts for wheat converge as time gets closer to the delivery date, so in order to make money on the hedge, the farmer must close out his position earlier than then. On the chance that prices decrease in the future, the farmer will make a profit on his short position in the futures market which offsets any decrease in revenues from the spot market for wheat. On the other hand, if prices increase, the farmer will generate a loss on the futures market which is offset by an increase in revenues on the spot market for wheat. Instead of agreeing to sell his wheat to one person on a set date, the farmer will just buy and sell futures on an exchange and then sell his wheat wherever he wants once he harvests it.|$|E

6000|$|... â€œOh, you have! Of my {{big sister}} Therese, six, {{ten years older}} than myself perhaps? She just comes a little above my shoulder, but then I was always a long thing. I never knew my mother. I donâ€™t even know how she looked. There are no {{paintings}} or photographs in our farmhouses amongst the hills. I havenâ€™t even heard her described to me. I believe I was never good enough to be told these things. Therese decided that I was a lump of wickedness, and now she believes that I will lose my soul altogether unless I take some steps to save it. Well, I have no particular taste that way. I suppose it is annoying to have a sister going fast to eternal perdition, but there are compensations. The funniest thing is that itâ€™s Therese, I believe, who managed to keep me out of the Presbytery when I went {{out of my way to}} look in on them on my return from my visit to the Quartel Real last year. I couldnâ€™t have stayed much more than half an hour with them anyway, but still I would have liked to get over the old doorstep. I am certain that Therese persuaded my uncle to go out and meet me at the bottom of the hill. I saw the old man a long way off and I understood how it was. I dismounted at once and met him on foot. We had half an hour together walking up and down the road. He is a peasant priest, he didnâ€™t know how to treat me. And of course I was uncomfortable, too. There wasnâ€™t a single goat about to keep me in countenance. I ought to have embraced him. I was always fond of the stern, simple old man. But he drew himself up when I approached him and actually took off his hat to me. So simple as that! I bowed my head and asked for his blessing. And he said â€˜I would never refuse a blessing to a good Legitimist.â€™ So stern as that! And when I think that I was perhaps the only girl of the family or in the whole world that he ever in his priestâ€™s life patted on the head! When I think of that I [...] . I believe at that moment I was as wretched as he was himself. I handed him an envelope with a big red seal which quite startled him. I had asked the Marquis de Villarel to give me a few words for him, because my uncle has a great influence in his district; and the Marquis penned with his own hand some compliments and an inquiry about the spirit of the population. My uncle read the letter, looked up at me with an air of mournful awe, and begged me to tell his excellency that the people were all for God, their lawful King and their old privileges. I said to him then, after he had asked me about the health of His Majesty in an awfully gloomy toneâ€”I said then: â€˜There is only one thing that remains for me to do, uncle, and that is to give you two pounds of the very best snuff I have brought here for you.â€™ What else could I have got for the poor old man? I had no trunks with me. I had to leave behind a spare pair of shoes in the hotel to make room in my little bag for that snuff. And fancy! That old priest absolutely pushed the parcel away. I could have thrown it at his head; but I thought suddenly of that hard, prayerful life, knowing nothing of any ease or pleasure in the world, absolutely nothing but a pinch of snuff now and then. I remembered how wretched he used to be when he lacked a copper or two to get some snuff with. My face was hot with indignation, but before I could fly out at him I remembered how simple he was. So I said with great dignity that as the present came from the King and as he wouldnâ€™t receive it from my hand there was nothing else for me to do but to throw it into the brook; and I made as if I were going to do it, too. He shouted: â€˜Stay, unhappy girl! Is it really from His Majesty, whom God preserve?â€™ I said contemptuously, â€˜Of course.â€™ He looked at me with great pity in his eyes, sighed deeply, and took the little tin from my hand. I suppose he imagined me in my abandoned way wheedling the necessary <b>cash</b> <b>out</b> of the King for the purchase of that snuff. You canâ€™t imagine how simple he is. Nothing was easier than to deceive him; but donâ€™t imagine I deceived him from the vainglory of a mere sinner. I lied to the dear man, simply because I couldnâ€™t bear the idea of him being deprived of the only gratification his big, ascetic, gaunt body ever knew on earth. As I mounted my mule to go away he murmured coldly: â€˜God guard you, SeÃ±ora!â€™ SeÃ±ora! What sternness! We were off a little way already when his heart softened and he shouted after me in a terrible voice: â€˜The road to Heaven is repentance!â€™ And then, after a silence, again the great shout â€˜Repentance!â€™ thundered after me. Was that sternness or simplicity, I wonder? Or a mere unmeaning superstition, a mechanical thing? If there lives anybody completely honest in this world, surely it must be my uncle. And yetâ€”who knows? ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{number of}} merchants permit {{customers}} using a debit card to withdraw cash {{as part of}} the EFTPOS transaction. In Australia, this facility (known as debit card cashback in many other countries) is known as [...] "cash out". For the merchant, <b>cash</b> <b>out</b> is a way of reducing their net cash takings, saving on banking of cash. There is no additional cost to the merchant in providing <b>cash</b> <b>out</b> because banks charge a merchant a debit card transaction fee per EFTPOS transaction, and not on the transaction value. <b>Cash</b> <b>out</b> is a facility provided by the merchant, and not the bank, so the merchant can limit or vary how much cash can be withdrawn at a time, or suspend the facility at any time. When available, <b>cash</b> <b>out</b> is convenient for the customer, who can bypass having to visit a bank branch or ATM. <b>Cash</b> <b>out</b> is also cheaper for the customer, since only one bank transaction is involved. For people in some remote areas, <b>cash</b> <b>out</b> may be {{the only way they can}} withdraw cash from their personal accounts. However, most merchants who provide the facility set a relatively low limit on <b>cash</b> <b>out,</b> generally $50, and some also charge for the service. Some merchants in Australia only allow <b>cash</b> <b>out</b> with the purchase of goods; other merchants allow <b>cash</b> <b>out</b> whether or not customers buy any goods. <b>Cash</b> <b>out</b> is not available in association with credit card sales because on credit card transactions the merchant is charged a percentage commission based on the transaction value, and also because cash withdrawals are treated differently from purchase transactions by the credit card company.
