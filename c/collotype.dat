The {{university}} published his current and previous work as an extensive portfolio of 780 <b>collotype</b> plates, under the title Animal Locomotion: An Electro-photographic Investigation of Consecutive Phases of Animal Movements, 1872–1885. The <b>collotype</b> plates measured 19 by 24inches, each were contained in 36 by 36-inch frames; the total number of images were approximately 20,000. The published plates included 514 of men and women in motion, 27 plates of abnormal male and female movement, 16 of children, 5 plates of adult male hand movement, and 221 with animal subjects.|$|E

The earliest, which belonged to Wordsworth, is partly in Coleridge's handwriting and partly in that of Mary Hutchinson (Mrs. Wordsworth). The probable date of this MS., now {{in the possession of}} the poet's grandson, Mr. Gordon Wordsworth, is April-October, 1800. Later in the same year, or perhaps in 1801, Coleridge made a copy of the First Part (or Book), the Conclusion to the First Book, and the Second Book, and presented it to Mrs. Wordsworth's sister, Sarah Hutchinson. A facsimile of the MS., now in the possession of Miss Edith Coleridge, was issued in <b>collotype</b> in the edition of Christabel published in 1907, {{under the auspices of the}} Royal Society of Literature. In 1801, or at some subsequent period (possibly not till 1815), Miss Hutchinson transcribed Coleridge's MS. The water-mark of the paper is 1801. Her transcript, now in the possession of Mr. A. H. Hallam Murray, was sent to Lord Byron in October, 1815. It is possible that this transcription was the 'copy' for the First Edition published in 1816; but, if so, Coleridge altered the text whilst the poem was passing through the press.|$|E

5000|$|Cronau {{contributed a}} series of {{articles}} and illustrations on the subject of life in the United States. In the fall of 1881 he journeyed to Fort Randall in Dakota Territory where he would meet and befriend Sitting Bull, then a prisoner of war at that post. Cronau was sympathetic to the Indian's plight, causing him to remain nearly half a year in the territory documenting and illustrating the Sioux. Most of Rudolf Cronau’s artistic work from that period is in pencil, some in pen, and there are a few watercolors. Some of his drawings were transferred into <b>collotypes,</b> a photo printing process using gelatin. After Cronau returned to Germany in 1883, he published 50 <b>collotypes</b> in a book about his American visit entitled [...] "Von Wunderland zu Wunderland".|$|R

50|$|Báez became {{interested}} in working with <b>collotypes</b> in the 1970s. During this time, the political climate of Puerto Rico had shifted. Her work {{began to focus on}} the new middle class. Art critic Margarita Fernández Zavala identifies class struggles in Báez's work which often explores urban themes and an emerging Puerto Rican bourgeoisie. There is a sense of uneasiness where individuals depicted in her portraits of this period seem unsure of their new economic and social status. Báez creates a sense of dichotomy with these pictures where the individuals portrayed don't seem to completely fit-in with their surroundings. They seem both at-odds with their world and, yet her vivid sense of color lifts them out of the ordinariness of everyday life.|$|R

He drew the sketches of plain folk around him, including the employees of his shipping firm. Around 2,000 sketches of his are preserved in the Rabindra Bharati University museum. Some of his sketches were published in Bharati in 1912. William Rothenstein happened to see them and evinced interest in them. He wanted {{to see more of}} his sketches. When Rabindranath proceeded for his third visit to England the same year, he carried a bunch of sketches prepared by Jyotirindranath. Rothenstein was highly impressed and with his assistance the book Twenty-five <b>collotypes</b> from the original Drawings of Jyotirindranath Tagore was published in England.|$|R
