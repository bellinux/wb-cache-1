25|$|A full {{container}} load (FCL) is an ISO {{standard container}} that is loaded and unloaded under the risk and account of one shipper and only one consignee.

FCL is intended to designate a container loaded to its allowable maximum weight or volume, but FCL in practice on ocean freight does not always mean a full payload or capacity - many companies will prefer to keep a 'mostly' full container as a single container load to simplify logistics and increase security compared to sharing a container with other goods.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reviews the}} current {{logistics}} processes and issues for <b>container</b> <b>shipments</b> {{in the supply}} chain. In particular, {{the problems associated with}} <b>container</b> <b>shipments</b> from China to the US, via the Hong Kong Port, includes low end-to-end visibility, security concerns, low product- handling productivity, and unmanageable unexpected events. Research was conducted using results from both interviews and surveys to collect information about the current process. This thesis also proposes the use of RFID-enabled logistics to improve the current processes and discusses the impact and value of the RFID-enabled processes. The research results show that through RFID technology, collaborators in the supply chain can improve product-handling productivity, supply chain visibility, and product security. Furthermore, the RFID application for supply chain management can increase the use of direct shipment and cross-docking, which result in considerable cost savings to both a manufacturer and a retailer. by Taehee Han.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a practical liner ship fleet deployment problem with week-dependent <b>container</b> <b>shipment</b> demand and transit time constraint, namely, maximum allowable transit time in container routing between {{a pair of}} ports. It first uses the space–time network approach to generate practical container routes subject to the transit time constraints. This paper proceeds to formulate the fleet deployment problem based on the practical container routes generated. In view of the intractability of the formulation, two relaxation models providing lower bounds are built: one requires known <b>container</b> <b>shipment</b> demand at the fleet deployment stage, and the other assumes constant <b>container</b> <b>shipment</b> demand over the planning horizon. An efficient global optimization algorithm is subsequently proposed.

A solution method integrating dual decomposition and Lagrangian relaxation method is designed for solving the developed model. Numerical experiments are carried out to assess applicability and performance of the proposed model and solution algorithm. The results further demonstrate importance of stochastic dependence of the uncertain <b>container</b> <b>shipment</b> demand...|$|E
