5|$|A five-year interim {{management}} plan {{was put in}} place by the Western Australia's Department of Environment and Conservation in October 2005. Actions under that plan include regular monitoring of populations, management of the threats of fire and P.cinnamomi, and the <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> of seed. As of December 2009 a recovery plan is being developed. There is also a translocation project underway.|$|E
5|$|All {{vegetables}} {{benefit from}} proper post harvest care. A {{large proportion of}} vegetables and perishable foods are lost after harvest during the storage period. These losses may {{be as high as}} thirty to fifty percent in developing countries where adequate <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> facilities are not available. The main causes of loss include spoilage caused by moisture, moulds, micro-organisms, and vermin.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{methods of}} {{producing}} lager were pioneered by Gabriel Sedlmayr the Younger, who perfected dark brown lagers at the Spaten Brewery in Bavaria, and Anton Dreher, who began brewing a lager (now known as Vienna lager), probably of amber-red colour, in Vienna in 1840–1841. With improved modern yeast strains, most lager breweries use only {{short periods of}} <b>cold</b> <b>storage,</b> typically 1–3 weeks.|$|E

5|$|A further block (also {{known as}} Annexe Market or Triangular Block) {{consisting}} of two separate structures (the Fish Market and the Red House) was built between 1886 and 1899. The Fish Market, built by John Mowlem & Co., was completed in 1888, one year after Sir Horace Jones' death. The Red House, with its imposing red brick and Portland stone façade, was built between 1898 and 1899 for the London Central Markets <b>Cold</b> <b>Storage</b> Co. Ltd..

5|$|For cut flowers, bulbs {{larger than}} 12cm in size are preferred. To bloom in December, bulbs are {{harvested}} in June to July, dried, stored {{for four days}} at 34°C, two weeks at 30 and two weeks at 17–20°C and then placed in <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> for precooling at 9 degrees for about 15–16 weeks.

5|$|For potted flowers a lower {{temperature}} {{is used for}} precooling (5°C for 15 weeks), followed by 16°C–18°C in a greenhouse. For later blooming (mid- and late-forcing), bulbs are harvested in July to August and the higher temperatures are omitted, being stored a 17–20°C after harvesting and placed in <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> at 9°C in September for 17–18 (cut flowers) or 14–16 (potted flowers) weeks.

5|$|Proper post-harvest storage {{aimed at}} {{extending}} and ensuring shelf life is best effected by efficient cold chain application. <b>Cold</b> <b>storage</b> is particularly useful for vegetables such as cauliflower, eggplant, lettuce, radish, spinach, potatoes, and tomatoes, the optimum temperature {{depending on the}} type of produce. There are temperature-controlling technologies that do not require the use of electricity such as evaporative cooling. Storage of fruit and vegetables in controlled atmospheres with high levels of carbon dioxide or high oxygen levels can inhibit microbial growth and extend storage life.|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{assessment}} of the thermodynamic performance of <b>cold</b> thermal <b>storage</b> systems using exergy and energy analyses. Several cases are considered, including some storages which are homogeneous, and others which undergo phase changes. In some cases the storages are stratified. A full cycle of charging, storing and discharging is considered for each case. Four <b>cold</b> thermal <b>storage</b> cases are presented in an illustrative example. The results demonstrate that. exergy analysis provides more realistic and accurate assessments of the efficiency and performance of <b>cold</b> thermal <b>storage</b> systems than those given by the more conventional energy analysis. In addition, exergy analysis is conceptually more direct since it treats cold as a valuable commodity. It is concluded that the potential usefulness of exergy analysis in addressing and solving <b>cold</b> thermal <b>storage</b> problem...|$|R

5|$|Located at the {{junction}} of Sungei Road and Pitt Road, was the former site of the Singapore Ice Works that {{was built in the}} 1930s. The factory was the first ice-making plant in Singapore using large compressors manufactured mainly from Carrier and York corporations.
