50|$|Concerns about {{chemicals}} ingested {{by children}} when chewing plastic toys prompted the European Commission {{to order a}} temporary ban on phthalates in 1999, the decision of {{which is based on}} an opinion by the Commission’s Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE). A proposal to make the ban permanent was tabled. Until 2004, EU banned the use of DEHP along with several other phthalates (DBP, BBP, DINP, DIDP and DNOP) in toys for young children. In 2005, the Council and the Parliament compromised to propose a ban on three types of phthalates (DINP, DIDP, and DNOP) “in toys and <b>childcare</b> <b>articles</b> which can be placed in the mouth by children”. Therefore, more products than initially planned will thus be affected by the directive. In 2008, six substances were considered to be of very high concern (SVHCs) and added to the Candidate List including Musk Xylene, MDA, HBCDD, DEHP, BBP, and DBP. In 2011, those six substances have been listed for Authorization in Annex XIV of REACH by Regulation (EU) No 143/2011. According to the regulation, phthalates including DEHP, BBP and DBP will be banned from February 2015.|$|E

30|$|Regulations {{put forward}} by the European Union (EU) are being {{employed}} {{for the assessment of}} the presence or migration of hazardous compounds in toys and <b>childcare</b> <b>articles</b> in many countries worldwide. The maximum migratory levels for BTEX compounds according to the BS EN 71 - 9 : 2005  + A 1 : 2007 standard of the EU are as follows: toluene— 2  mg/L of aqueous migrate, xylene (all isomers)— 2  mg/L of aqueous migrate (total) and ethylbenzene— 1  mg/L of aqueous migrate. The presence of benzene in any toy or childcare article is completely restricted. For phthalates, according to the EU regulation (1999 / 815 /EC), the migration of 10 phthalates including diethyl and dibutyl phthalate are to be maintained at a level less than 0.1  % of the weight of the material intended to be placed in the mouths of children.|$|E
30|$|Hazardous {{compounds}} {{present in}} various consumer goods {{have come to}} light {{as a result of}} recent studies. The presence and the migration of BTEX and phthalates in certain toys and <b>childcare</b> <b>articles</b> have been previously reported (Abe et al. 2013; Earls et al. 2003; Johnson et al. 2011; Marin et al. 1998). While most studies have focused on identification and determining total levels of such compounds present in the article (Lim et al. 2014; Marin et al. 1998), only a few have studied the migratory levels (Abe et al. 2013). A very limited number of studies have assessed the fate of these compounds once they enter the body (Brandon et al. 2006; Dennison et al. 2005). This creates a need for a migration study using a saliva simulant. By gaining better insight on the oral exposure scenario, a more accurate health risk assessment can be done.|$|E

30|$|The minimum {{detection}} limit for BTEX ranged from 1.22 to 1.60  µg/L. The {{highest level of}} toluene migration of 9.35  mg/L; almost three times the EU standard level of 2  mg/L, was observed in the imported balloon brand I 3. The lowest migratory level was observed in a local large scale manufacturer L 1 at 1.24  mg/L and was below the EU regulatory limit. All other brands that exhibited toluene migration exceeded the maximum permissible level. The migration of xylene was observed in four brands (I 1, I 3, S 1, L 3) and varied between 6.79 and 0.72  mg/L, with three brands (I 1, I 3, S 1) exceeding the maximum migratory level of 2  mg/L. Ethylbenzene migration occurred in two imported brands I 2 and I 3. Brand I 3 exceeded the maximum migratory limit at 1.17  mg/L and the other remained at 0.66  mg/L, below the maximum permissible level. Benzene migration was detected in a single local small scale manufactured brand S 2 {{at a level of}} 0.77  mg/L. According to EU regulations that clearly restricts the presence of benzene in toys and <b>childcare</b> <b>articles,</b> the observed migratory level is a serious violation. Migratory levels of benzene and ethylbenzene were less prominent compared to toluene and xylene levels.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comIn the light of women’s increased labour force participation {{and the demands of}} western feminism for men’s participation in housework and <b>childcare,</b> this <b>article</b> analyses vocabularies on these issues among young people in Australia, USA and Canada and seven countries in Asia. While very few young people in any of the samples use explicitly feminist justifications for their statements, there is high support for sharing housework when both partners are in paid work. By contrast, the strong support for role reversal — for men being ‘house husbands’ — is confined to the western samples. The article explores reasons for these differences based in respondents’ domestic experiences and national family policies. Where many of the western respondents rely on equality or individualism, the Asian respondents are more likely to understand the role of the husband and wife {{in the context of their}} duties to each other and the nation or to assert the existence of gender differences between men and women.

40|$|The Labour {{government}} aims {{to increase}} the lone parent employment rate to 70 per cent by 2010. To achieve this aim, it has introduced a state subsidy for childcare {{in the form of}} the childcare element of the Working Tax Credit. So far this has been limited to formal childcare despite evidence that lone parents are more likely to use informal <b>childcare.</b> This <b>article</b> investigates the potential of a state subsidy to be extended to support informal childcare. Utilizing evidence from a study of 78 qualitative in-depth interviews with lone parents, it explores preferences for informal care and the way that informal care is negotiated. On the one hand, we found that some lone parents held deeply embedded preferences for informal childcare based on trust, commitment, shared understandings and children's happiness. Thus it can be concluded that it is important for the government to support informal as well as formal care. On the other, we found that the way lone parents actually negotiated informal childcare involved complex notions of obligation, duty and reciprocity, suggesting that a subsidy could potentially intrude upon complex private family relationships. However, the evidence suggests that care was negotiated differently depending on whether it was provided by a grandparent or other family and friends, with lone parents tending to favour paying for childcare provided by other family and friends than grandparents. This has implications for a state subsidy, which needs further investigation...|$|R
40|$|On {{behalf of}} CEN/TC 248 /WG 26 and ISO/TC 38 /WG 22, the European Commission’s Joint Research Center (JRC) {{organised}} a collaborative {{study on the}} determination of PVC and phthalates in textiles products. The {{purpose of the study}} was the comparison and validation of four methods for the determination of phthalates and the validation of one method to determine the content of PVC in textile products. Methods 1, 2 and 3 were based on ultrasonic extraction of phthalates with n-hexane/acetone 80 / 20 v/v, n-hexane, tert-butyl methyl ether, respectively, and method 4 foresaw PVC dissolution in tetrahydrofuran and re-precipitation with acetonitrile. One method for the quantification of PVC in textile products based on the dissolution of PVC with tetrahydrofuran, followed by the washing of the residue and its gravimetric determination was also investigated (method 5). The collaborative exercise was organised, according to ISO 5725 - 2, as a balanced uniform-level experiment with the same number of test results in each laboratory, which each laboratory analysing the same levels of test samples. Thirteen laboratories both European and non-European participated to this study. The Italian company MP S. p. A produced both the PVC samples and the textile ones, made by cotton spread with PVC layer. Four textile and one PVC samples containing in total 7 phthalates (DEHP, DBP, BBP, DINP, DIDP, DNOP and DIBP) at 3 concentration levels and one sample, in which the PVC mass per cent had to be measured were analysed in triplicates. Levels I, II and III refer to samples containing a specific phthalate in concentrations of approximately 200, 1000 and 5000 mg/kg. In the case of DIDP and DINP, level I corresponded to approximately 500 mg/kg of PVC. These phthalate concentrations were selected in order to assess the precision of the analytical methods in the range of the current limits for toys and <b>childcare</b> <b>articles.</b> The homogeneity study was carried out by the JRC and all samples could be considered ‘sufficiently homogeneous’ according to the IUPAC harmonised protocol for proficiency testing. Results were statistically evaluated following the rules laid down in ISO 5725 parts 2 and 5. The consensus values and the precisions of the various methods, in terms of repeatability and reproducibility limits as well as repeatability and reproducibility relative standard deviations, were evaluated. Applying ISO 5725 - 2, the statistical outliers identified with Cochran’s and Grubbs’ tests were rejected, together with the results of LC 0004 for method 4 and the ones of LC 0005 for DIDP in methods 1 - 4, which were identified as outliers with Mandel’s h statistics. On the contrary, considering ISO 5725 - 5, all test results were retained and robust statistics was used. These two alternative approaches gave results that could be considered in good agreement. Generally, the differences were always lower than 35 %, except in few cases. Concerning the extraction efficiency, method 4 proved to be the best one in terms of phthalates’ recovery, whereas method 2 was the worst one. Practically the same recovery rate was shown by methods 1 and 3. Relative standard deviations of repeatability and reproducibility ranged from 3. 0 to 23. 5 % and from 19. 4 and 189. 9 % respectively. This means that both the four methods and the laboratories’ performance have to be drastically improved. Poor repeatability was observed in the case of several laboratories and the large spread in the mean values calculated in the 13 laboratories is responsible for the high observed relative standard deviation of reproducibility. Regarding method 5 for the quantification of PVC, repeatability and reproducibility relative standard deviations were 0. 6 and 1. 4 % respectively. Considering that these values are in the same range of the values obtained with similar dissolution methods validated in the context of quantification of fibre binary mixtures, this method can be considered validated.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{ascertain}} whether certain migrants and refugees have been telling the ‘truth’ about their age, the UK border control system has, in the past, relied {{on the use of}} skeletal x- ray to estimate the applicant’s age, and in recent years has sought to use dental x-ray for the same purpose. However using x-ray for age assessment purposes has been criticised as inaccurate in providing a reasonable estimate of age and as an unnecessary medical risk, which infringes the human rights of the applicant.

40|$|Today, many {{working parents}} {{are caught in}} a “childcare squeeze”: while they require two incomes just to make ends meet, they end up {{spending}} a strikingly large percentage of their income on childcare {{so that they can}} work outside the home.

Currently, the Internal Revenue Code treats the childcare costs incurred by working parents as personal expenses, subject to various dollar limitations, percentage limits, and phaseouts.

This Article shows that this is inappropriate as a matter of fundamental tax policy and results in the overtaxation of the working family.

METHOD: Twenty-seven facilities (9 centers, 10 homes, and 8 FDK) participated in this study. Participants (aged 2. 5 - 5 years; n = 297) were fitted with Actical™ accelerometers for 5 consecutive days during childcare/school hours to assess their PA. The Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation (EPAO) tool was used to objectively examine the PA environment of all participating facilities. Finally, demographic questionnaires were administered to preschoolers 2 ̆ 7 parents/guardians. RESULTS: Preschoolers in FDK accumulated significantly more MVPA (p 3 ̆c. 05; 3. 33 min/hr) than those in center- (1. 58 min/hr) and home-based (1. 75 min/hr) childcare, and they accumulated significantly more TPA (p 3 ̆c. 05; 20. 31 min/hr) than those in center-based childcare (18. 36 min/hr). For FDK, the Active Opportunities, Sedentary Opportunities, Sedentary Environment, and Fixed Play Environment subscales of the EPAO significantly impacted both MVPA and TPA. For center-based childcare, only the Sedentary Environment subscale was found to impact MVPA and TPA. No subscales influenced children 2 ̆ 7 s MVPA or TPA in home-based childcare.
