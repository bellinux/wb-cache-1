40|$|Thermal {{stress and}} in {{particular}} heat during anthesis causes sterility in rice inflorescences. Rice spikelets open {{in the morning and}} close a few hours later. Genotypic variation in the time of day of anthesis is considered an escape mechanism from thermal stress, but little is known on its dependency on environmental conditions. One traditional, cold-tolerant rice cultivar and three improved tropical rice cultivars were grown in four different climatic environments under flooded conditions to study the environmental response of time of day of anthesis. The environments were the cold-dry season and the hot-dry season in Senegal, the temperate summer in Southern France and the dry season in the Philippines. The time of day when the first spikelets opened, a maximum of spikelets were open and the last spikelets closed was observed daily on a population basis (2 m 2 plots replicated 3 times). The time of these observations was expressed as hours after sunrise (hasr) calculated from astronomic day length and the local time of solar noon. Aggregate flowering periods were 4 - 10 d at panicle scale and 14 - 32 d at population scale. Within a day, onset of anthesis was earliest in the Philippines (3. 4 hasr) and latest in the cool season in Senegal (6. 75 hasr), the other environments being intermediate. The duration from onset to end of anthesis varied between 1. 82 h in the Philippines and 2. 77 h in France. Genotypic differences in time of anthesis and duration of anthesis were small. Across all genotypes and environments, 80 % of the variation of the time of maximum anthesis could be explained with the mean minimum air temperature (T min) during the 7 d preceding any given anthesis event. Linear, multiple regression models determined for each cultivar using T min and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) observations from the three tropical environments explained 94 % of variation of time of anthesis onset and end. Low T min thereby delayed and low VPD advanced anthesis processes. Under the assumption that panicle temperature during anthesis is indeed a major determinant of spikelet fertility in rice, it is concluded that the sensitivity of time of day of anthesis to air temperature and humidity is an effective eco-physiological adaptation of the rice <b>crop.</b> <b>Prospects</b> for improved modeling approaches for the prediction of thermal sterility in rice are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|SUMMARY] At {{first the}} grain <b>crop</b> <b>prospect</b> was very good. In {{particular}} the crop perspective of rye which has duplicate demand as food（bread） and feed was remarkably favorable. But the forecast prospect worsened {{as time went}} owing to the serious crop losses caused by bad weather and the harvest largely declined as a result. In addition, the Second ４ Year Plan was announced on ９ September. So the distribution of grain must have been previously and strictly controlled. Because the supplies mobilization program would be all the more needed. The distributive regulation of feed grain was also inevitably strengthened {{by the introduction of}} its own delivery certificate and the statement duty for resale towards the economic authority of grain in the involved state. In spite of these coercive arrangements, the delivery of food grain（particularly rye）sharply stagnated from the late autumn. The prohibition of the resale of food grain as feed grain was consequently ordered in January 1937. In the third grain procurement measures the whole quantity control was put into practice including the comprehension of the distribution of feed grain. Therefore the private initiative of the farmers engaged in animal husbandry came to be more severely than ever before restrained...|$|R

As small farmers evaluate other <b>cropping</b> <b>prospects,</b> organic <b>cropping</b> systems {{and the availability of}} organic price premiums should be considered as an alternative in meeting farm profitability goals. This study compared the economic return per acre of converting to an organic cropping system from a conventional system against the conventional crop enterprise of the same crop mix. A simulation model was created using assumed organic yield data, actual organic prices, historical conventional yield data and historical conventional prices to determine the economic return. An initial simulation was run, ignoring the three-year transitional period that farms must undergo with no synthetic inputs to become certified organic, to determine if organic cropping systems using organic price premiums on the 600 -acre farm would be competitive with conventional production. The simulation showed that organic production is economically competitive with conventional production. Previous studies and personal interviews indicated that the three-year transitional period could easily cause the farm economic loss, since conventional inputs cannot be used and organic premiums cannot be obtained for crops sold. Therefore, three different conversion schemes were simulated to find which one would cause the farm the least economic damage: converting the entire farm to organic production at once, converting 20 % of the farm's tillable acres to organic production annually and converting 10 % of the farm's tillable acres to organic production annually. All three of the proposed transition schedules revealed economic loss to the farm at some point during their transition periods. The only scheme that showed no average loss was the existing conventional system. However, after complete transition, the three transition schemes showed higher profitability than the conventional cropping system. The downside was that this took a minimum of 13 years to accomplish. The only scheme that did not cause the farm's cumulative present value to drop into negative numbers was the 10 % per year transition rate...|$|R

40|$|Some {{years ago}} the MARS-FOOD group was {{established}} to support the Food Aid and Food Security policies of the European Commission. The activities are aimed at improving methods and information on <b>crop</b> yield <b>prospects.</b> Russia, Central Asia, and non-European Mediterranean countries (MECA region), Eastern Africa (IGAD sub-region) and the MERCOSUR region in South America were selected as pilot areas. Crop growth indicators are produced based on low resolution remote sensing data, global meteorological modelling outputs (ECMWF model) and crop growth simulation models (CGMS and FAO-WSI). Crop yield forecasting is done using predictors selected from the crop growth indicators. Dekadal SPOT-VEGETATION data are used {{as a basis for}} calculation of remote sensing indicators of crop growth. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and results of Dry Matter Production modelling (DMP) applying the Monteith approach (Monteith, 1972) are used as a main source of remote sensing indicators for the MECA region. The indicators are used in aggregated for sub-national administrative unit form applying crop mask. Some indicators are derived for a network of representative points. The current dekadal indicators are compared with previous year dekadal values or with long-term average dekadal data. Additionally relative time mosaics of indicators are used as a tool for crop growth monitoring (Savin, Nègre, 2002). We analyze additionally seasonal cumulative values of indicators by comparing seasonal time profiles. As a result, near 10 remote sensing indicators can be derived for each crop for each dekad of growing season in aggregated form and the same amount for representative points. Crop yield forecasting starts from an attempt to build simple regression equation between statistical crop yield and crop growth indicators. We found that regression with high R...|$|R
40|$|Farmers {{around the}} world have to cope with {{apparently}} unpredictable climatic hazards. Droughts and floods, sudden extreme heat or cold which are merely inconveniences to most people are of much greater concern to farmers. Their livelihoods are affected and often their lives themselves are at stake. In order to survive they must farm efficiently under conditions of climatic risk. This is particularly true of the semi-arid regions. Many of the countries of the Tropics and Subtropics face similar problems of rainfall variability, often under conditions of extreme population pressure. In July 1990, a group of scientists and economists met in Brisbane, Australia, to participate in a symposium on climatic risk in crop production; the resulting book contains 24 invited papers given at the symposium. It reviews progress in methods for quantifying climatic risk, in reducing that risk and uncertainty by improved long term weather forecasting, and in developing management strategies to cope with climatic risk. The book is divided into seven parts: the importance of climatic variability m crop production, estimating climatic risk to crop production (methods); estimating risk (applications); optimizing agronomic practice in response to climatic risk; decision-making to reduce risk of <b>crop</b> failure; <b>prospects</b> for, and implications of, improved weather prediction, and setting priorities for research. At a time when it is becoming widely acknowledged that climatic variations will increase, these analyses are particularly welcome.

40|$|Energy is {{essential}} and vital for development, {{and the global}} economy literally runs on energy. The use of fossil fuels as energy is now widely accepted as unsustainable due to depleting resources and also due to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the environment. Renewable and carbon neutral biodiesel are necessary for environmental and economic sustainability. Biodiesel demand is constantly increasing as the reservoir of fossil fuel are depleting. Unfortunately biodiesel produced from oil crop, waste cooking oil and animal fats {{are not able to}} replace fossil fuel. The viability of the first generation biofuels production is however questionable because of the conflict with food supply. Production of biodiesel using microalgae biomass appears to be a viable alternative. The oil productivity of many microalgae exceeds the best producing oil crops. Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms which convert sunlight, water and CO 2 to sugars, from which macromolecules, such as lipids and triacylglycerols (TAGs) can be obtained. These TAGs are the promising and sustainable feedstock for biodiesel production. Microalgal biorefinery approach can be used to reduce the cost of making microalgal biodiesel. Microalgal-based carbon sequestration technologies cover the cost of carbon capture and sequestration. The present paper is an attempt to review the potential of microalgal biodiesel in comparison to the agricultural <b>crops</b> and its <b>prospects</b> in India.

It was designed to work one hectare to a depth of 8 - 10 cm in ten hours, using a pair of oxen. One of its main advantages is that it prevents the formation of a thick crust on the soil surface. The draft-powered courter, also developed by CEEMAT, is designed for use during the dry season to break up the soil and allow water to penetrate as soon as the rains begin. The furrows it draws reduce run-off and hence minimize erosion. The rollivator and courter both are designed {{to be used in the}} Sudano-Sahelian region; by enabling earlier <b>crop</b> sowing, the <b>prospect</b> of a good harvest can be much improved.

Therefore developing improved varieties and designing newer approaches for crop improvement against stress tolerance have become a priority now-a-days. However, most of the crop improvement strategies are directed toward staple cereals such as rice, wheat, maize etc., whereas attention on minor cereals such as finger millet [Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn. ] lags far behind. It is an important staple in several semi-arid and tropical {{regions of the world}} with excellent nutraceutical properties as well as ensuring food security in these areas even during harsh environment.
