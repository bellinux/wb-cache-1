40|$|Prevention and {{management}} of wound infections receive a lot of attention, since the presence of micro-organisms interferes with the wound-healing process. The aim of this work was to use cyclodextrins (CDs) to endow hydrogels and gauzes {{with the ability to}} take up antiseptics and sustain their delivery for several hours. Benzalkonium chloride (BzCl) can form inclusion complexes with cross-linked CDs that regulate the release through an affinity-driven mechanism. Grafting of CDs to <b>cotton</b> <b>gauzes</b> using citric acid as the linker, at 190 degrees C and for 15 min, led to grafting yields of about 148 %, much larger than those obtained at 180 degrees C or with shorter reaction times. Microbiological tests revealed that the BzCl-loaded networks can inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli both on agar plates and in liquid medium. Furthermore, the antiseptic-loaded gauzes were able to inhibit biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus RN 1 HG pMV 158 GFP when applied in early stages of biofilm formation and could reduce the number of living cells in preformed biofilms grown in a chronic wound biofilm model. These findings highlight the role of CDs as main components of hydrogels and gauzes for the efficient delivery of antiseptics...|$|R

40|$|Multidrug-resistant {{organisms are}} {{increasingly}} implicated in acute and chronic wound infections, thus compromising {{the chance of}} therapeutic options. The resistance to conventional antibiotics demonstrated by some bacterial strains has encouraged new approaches {{for the prevention of}} infections in wounds and burns, among them the use of silver compounds and nanocrystalline silver. Recently, silver wound dressings have become widely accepted in wound healing centers and are commercially available. In this work, novel antibacterial wound dressings have been developed through a silver deposition technology based on the photochemical synthesis of silver nanoparticles. The devices obtained are completely natural and the silver coatings are characterized by an excellent adhesion without the use of any binder. The silver-treated <b>cotton</b> <b>gauzes</b> were characterized through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) in order to verify the distribution and the dimension of the silver particles on the cotton fibers. The effectiveness of the silver-treated gauzes in reducing the bacterial growth and biofilm proliferation has been demonstrated through agar diffusion tests, bacterial enumeration test, biofilm quantification tests, fluorescence and SEM microscopy. Moreover, potential cytotoxicity of the silver coating was evaluated through 3 -[4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide colorimetric assay (MTT) and the extract method on fibroblasts and keratinocytes.

Mixed polymer formulations like chitosan-sodium alginate, sodium alginate-calcium alginate and chitosan-sodium alginate-calcium alginate were prepared and coated separately on <b>cotton</b> <b>gauze</b> surface using pad-dry-cure method. The herbal extract of Bletilla striata was immobilized on the polymer coated fabrics to increase the rate of wound healing.
