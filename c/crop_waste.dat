5|$|After the {{development}} of larger and faster-growing hogs (due to crosses between European and Asian breeds) in the 18th and 19th century in the United States, backyard and small-scale hog production provided an inexpensive means of converting waste food, <b>crop</b> <b>waste,</b> and garbage into calories (in a relatively small space and {{in a relatively short}} period of time). Many of those calories came in the form of fat and rendered lard. Lard was used for almost all cooking and was a fundamental component in many common homestead foods (many that today are still regarded as holiday and comfort foods) like biscuits and pies. The economic/caloric necessity of consuming lard and other saved fats may have led to the popularity of fried foods, not only in the US, but worldwide. In the 19th century cast iron became widely available for use in cooking. The combination of flour, lard, a chicken and a heavy pan placed over a relatively controllable flame became the beginning of today's fried chicken.|$|E

30|$|The {{design of}} biomass carbonizers, gasifiers or pyrolysers is an {{emerging}} concept that will add value to wastes and attract large and small-scale farmers to adopt biochar (Hussein et al. 2015).

Therefore, the main objective {{of this study was to}} assess the physico-chemical properties of biochar produced from <b>crop</b> <b>wastes</b> for their purposeful use in enhancing soil fertility and mitigating climate change. The specific objectives were: (1) compare the pyrolysis of biochar from different <b>crop</b> <b>wastes,</b> and (2) to assess their carbon sequestration potential.

30|$|Table  7 {{shows that}} <b>crop</b> <b>wastes</b> contain large {{quantities}} of both N, P and K. During plant growth and development, a large percentage about 25 % of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and 75 % of potassium (K) uptake by agricultural crops are retained in crop residues, making them valuable nutrient sources (Enders et al. 2012; Adamu et al. 2014; Kumer et al. 2015). Open burning of <b>crop</b> <b>wastes</b> contributes significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as carbon dioxide, monoxide, nitrous oxide (N 2 O), sulphur dioxide (SO 2), methane (CH 4) along with particulate matter and hydrocarbons (Adamu et al. 2014). These trace gases have adverse impacts on air pollution and water quality {{as well as on}} human and animal health (Kumer et al. 2015). Open burning also results in the loss of plant nutrients and thus adversely affect soil properties (International Biochar Initiative 2016). Pyrolysis causes the decomposition of the functional groups and improves other properties such as such as surface area, porosity, adsorption, and recalcitrant chemical character in the biochars (Rajkovich et al. 2012). It will therefore be more sustainable to convert <b>crop</b> <b>wastes</b> to biochar for use in agriculture rather than open burning as means of waste disposal.|$|R

40|$|After 16 {{years of}} {{periodical}} applications of either farmyard manure or <b>crop</b> <b>wastes</b> at {{two levels of}} mineral N fertilization to a Calcic Haploxeralf in the semiarid central Spain, we found significant changes in chemical fertility levels and in the concentration, chemical composition, and carbon mineralization rates of soil organic matter (SOM). The changes in SOM quality were related to significant improvements of soil physical properties, mainly aggregate stability and water retention. Such changes {{were related to the}} increased concentration of humic colloids in soil, the mineral N dose, and the type of organic matter applied. When compared with the control plots, the organic matter accumulated in the amended plots tended to be less transformed, and its total concentration and humification degree decreased with increasing external N-inputs. Humic acids from the amended plots showed a more marked aliphatic character (mainly after N addition) than those from control plots. Farmyard manure led to a significant improvement of soil physical properties, but had a comparatively small effect in promoting biodegradation and humification of <b>crop</b> <b>wastes.</b> This could be due to the high biological stability of the manure used which, in semiarid Mediterranean fields, usually leads to an accumulation of little transformed SOMFinancial support from the Spanish CICyT grant AGL 2002 - 04186 is gratefully acknowledgedPeer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Pseudomonas syringae pv. porri, {{the causal}} agent of {{bacterial}} blight of leek, is a current threat for leek (Allium porrum) {{production in the}} Netherlands. The roles of post-harvest <b>crop</b> <b>waste</b> and plant invasion from soil in leek plant infection was investigated with the purpose to gain better understanding on the ecology and epidemiology of this pathogen. In a survey done over 167 leek fields, P. syringae pv. porri was present in 101 fields. About a tenfold higher P. syringae pv. porri average infection rate was recorded in leek plants from fields where post-harvest <b>crop</b> <b>waste</b> was returned than in those from fields where no waste was returned. P. syringae pv. porri could survive for at least 1 month in shredded plant material made from infected plants (mimicking <b>crop</b> <b>waste</b> in practice). Field experiments done over three successive years revealed that leek plants that were treated with <b>crop</b> <b>waste</b> at the nursery and production growth stages consistently showed higher infection rates than plants that remained untreated. Plants that were treated with <b>crop</b> <b>waste</b> only at one of both stages revealed intermediate infection rates. In a plant-soil microcosm study, it appeared that P. syringae pv. porri strain P 55 R colony numbers in the leek rhizosphere were approximately 4 orders in magnitude higher than in corresponding bulk soils.

40|$|The {{dominance}} of biofuel combustion {{emissions in the}} Indian region, and the inherently large uncertainty in biofuel use estimates based on cooking energy surveys, prompted the current work, which develops a new methodology for estimating biofuel consumption for cooking. This is based on food consumption statistics, and the specific energy for food cooking. Estimated biofuel consumption in India was 379 (247 - 584) Tg yr(- 1). New information on the user population of different biofuels was compiled at a state level, to derive the biofuel mix, which varied regionally and was 74 : 16 : 10 %, respectively, of fuelwood, dung cake and <b>crop</b> <b>waste,</b> at a national level. Importantly, the uncertainty in biofuel use from quantitative error assessment using the new methodology is around 50 %, giving a narrower bound than in previous works. From this new activity data and currently used black carbon emission factors, the black carbon (BC) emissions from biofuel combustion were estimated as 220 (65 - 760) Gg yr(- 1). The largest BC emissions were from fuelwood (75 %), with lower contributions from dung cake (16 %) and <b>crop</b> <b>waste</b> (9 %). The uncertainty of 245 % in the BC emissions estimate is now governed by the large spread in BC emission factors from biofuel combustion (122 %), implying the need for reducing this uncertainty through measurements. Emission factors of SO 2 from combustion of biofuels widely used in India were measured, and ranged 0. 03 - 0. 08 g kg(- 1) from combustion of two wood species, 0. 05 - 0. 20 g kg(- 1) from 10 <b>crop</b> <b>waste</b> types, and 0. 88 g kg(- 1) from dung cake, significantly lower than currently used emission factors for wood and <b>crop</b> <b>waste.</b> Estimated SO 2 emissions from biofuels of 75 (36 - 160) Gg yr(- 1) were about a factor of 3 lower than that in recent studies, with a large contribution from dung cake (73 %), followed by fuelwood (21 %) and <b>crop</b> <b>waste</b> (6 %) ...|$|E

Due to the rapid development in agricultural sectors, there are approximately 1. 2 million tons of agricultural wastes being disposed annually in Malaysia. This kind of waste is usually eliminated by burned or decomposed and lead to the arising of some environmental issues. Regarding to environmental and sustainability awareness, concerns on the long term effect of burning <b>crop</b> <b>waste</b> have been expressed including pineapple leaves burning. Responding to this emerging issue, there are emphases on transformation of <b>crop</b> <b>waste</b> to wealth {{in order to create}} a sustainable agriculture industry. In pineapple cultivation, the pineapple leaves can be further processed to produce value-added products. Pineapple waste is no longer something that is unwanted.

In Malaysia, several initiatives have been done in order to extract fiber from pineapple leaves and convert into commercial products. However, the process involved in pineapple leaves fiber productions is still lag behind technologies development in this era.
