Mumbai Port {{has one of the}} best natural {{harbours}} in the world, and has extensive wet and dry dock accommodation facilities. Jawaharlal Nehru Port, commissioned on 26 May 1989, is the busiest and most modern major port in India.

5|$|The Jawaharlal Nehru Port, which {{currently}} handles 55–60% of India's <b>containerised</b> <b>cargo,</b> was commissioned on 26 May 1989 across the creek at Nhava Sheva {{with a view}} to de-congest Bombay Harbour and to serve as a hub port for the city. The geographical limits of Greater Bombay were coextensive with municipal limits of Greater Bombay.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{comparison of}} intermodal network capacities for Ports of Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney, {{and how these}} ports are planning to meet their future demand prediction. In Queensland and New South Wales, there are obvious regions for economic growth and rapid urban development. In Queensland, South East Queensland region {{has been identified as}} the region for fast economic, industrial, residential and urban developments. In the past 20 years, urbanisation in Sydney has moved to Central West Sydney, Western Sydney and South West Sydney. In Victoria, the Victoria Government adopts the policy to manage growth to ensure sustainability for all urban and rural areas. Melbourne is planning the capacity of its metropolitan and surrounding areas to absorb estimated of 620, 000 extra households over the next 30 years while protecting and enhancing existing suburbs. The Australian Government Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics estimated that Australian ports that serve <b>containerised</b> <b>cargoes</b> in major capital cities including Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney would handle the increase demand in <b>containerised</b> <b>cargoes</b> between 100 % and 300 % by 2025 compared with the current <b>containerised</b> <b>cargoes</b> handled by these ports in 2004 / 05. Most Australian major container ports are currently planning their port capacities to meet these estimates. Container ports face similar problems such as limited port lands, limited intermodal terminals, port access congestion, environmental issues, etc. Topics to be discussed and compared in this report include: • Estimated demand for future <b>containerised</b> <b>cargoes</b> • Port facilities • Plans for freight terminals at port precincts • Road and rail accessibility to ports • Road and rail freight networks • Current port-freight intermodal terminal networks • Road and rail network infrastructure to support freight movements including AusLink networks • Plans for future demand including; o Future port capacity o Future intermodal terminals o Future road and rail acces...|$|R

Its development was accelerated further with the extension of a railway line from Kuala Lumpur to the new port.

50|$|Indian Railway's {{strategic}} {{initiative to}} <b>containerise</b> <b>cargo</b> transport put India on the intermodal freight transport map {{for the first}} time in 1966. Given India's size (almost 3000 km from North to South and East to West), rail transport is often a cheaper option for all cargo over medium and long distances, especially if the cost of inter-modal transfers can be reduced. Seeing that containerised multi-modal door-to-door transport provided a solution to this problem, in 1966 Indian Railways entered the market for moving door-to-door domestic cargo in special DSO containers.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{standardised}} {{freight container}} {{was one of}} the most important innovations of the 20 th Century. <b>Containerised</b> <b>cargoes</b> travel from their point of origin to their destination by ship, road and rail as part of a single journey, without unpacking. This simple concept is the key element in cheap, rapid transport by land and sea, and has led to a phenomenal growth in global trade. Likewise, <b>containerised</b> air <b>cargo</b> has led to a remarkable increase in the inter-continental transportation of goods, particularly perishable items such as flowers, fresh vegetables and live animals. In both cases, containerisation offers great advantages in speed and security, but reduces the opportunity to inspect cargoes in transit. An inevitable consequence is the globalisation of undesirable species of animals, plants and pathogens. Moreover, cheap passenger flights offer worldwide travel for viral and parasitic pathogens in infected humans. The continued emergence of exotic pests, vectors and pathogens throughout the world is an unavoidable consequence of these advances in transportation technology...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} issues in the {{shipping}} industry is ensuring safety. This article will draw attention to a particular problem with <b>containerised</b> <b>cargoes,</b> namely the issue of correctly stating a cargo’s characteristics. Safety includes the correct statement {{with regard to the}} weight and contents of the container to be loaded. It is suggested that 10 per cent of containers have wrongly declared weights when presented to the ship for loading. These weights are declared by the shippers. Such errors can lead to stability problems and difficulties in stowage. This, in turn, can result in lives and property being put at risk...|$|R

40|$|Container port {{accessibility}} {{examines the}} potential or {{opportunity for the}} transportation of <b>containerised</b> <b>cargoes</b> within the global liner shipping network. It is also a particularly relevant aspect of port competitiveness since, as previous studies have pointed out, the level of throughput at any container port is significantly and positively correlated to its accessibility. This paper aims not only to generate quantitative estimates of individual container port accessibility, but also to provide a numerical basis for comparing the relative geographical importance of each port. For this purpose, the principal eigenvector method is described and applied {{to a sample of}} port data. By supplementing extant technical indicators that relate to port competitiveness, such as port prices and estimates of relative efficiency, with a quantitative measure of port accessibility, the results provide {{a better understanding of the}} current structure of the global liner shipping network and the ongoing status of inter-port competition.
