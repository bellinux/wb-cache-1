500|$|However, when Domnall mac Causantín died at Dunnottar in 900, he was {{the first}} man to be {{recorded}} as rí Alban and his kingdom was the nucleus that would expand as Viking and other influences waned. In the tenth century the Alban elite had begun to develop a conquest myth to explain their increasing Gaelicisation at the expense of Pictish culture. Known as MacAlpin's Treason, it describes how Cináed mac Ailpín is supposed to have annihilated the Picts in one fell takeover. However, modern historians are now beginning to reject this conceptualization of Scottish origins. No contemporary sources mention this conquest. Moreover, the Gaelicisation of Pictland was a long process predating Cináed, and is evidenced by Gaelic-speaking Pictish rulers, Pictish royal patronage of Gaelic poets, and Gaelic inscriptions and placenames. The <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> can perhaps be explained by the death of the Pictish language, but also important may be Causantín II's alleged Scoticisation of the [...] "Pictish" [...] Church and the trauma caused by Viking invasions, most strenuously felt in the Pictish kingdom's heartland of Fortriu.|$|E

[...] She was always friendly, but never made those {{interesting}} betrayals of regard which are so encouraging to youthful gentlemen [...] "who fain would climb, yet fear to fall." [...] She never blushed when he pressed her hand, never fainted or grew pale when he appeared with a smashed trotting-wagon and black eye, and actually slept through a serenade that would have won any other woman's soul out of her body with its despairing quavers. Matters were getting desperate; for horses lost their charms, [...] "flowing bowls" [...] palled upon his lips, ruffled shirt-bosoms no longer delighted him, and hops possessed no soothing power to allay the anguish of his mind. Mr. Seguin, after unavailing ridicule and pity, took compassion on him, and from his large experience suggested a remedy, just as he was departing for a more congenial sphere.|$|E

Those two communities had previously been of more or less equal socio-economic standing but the emphasis of the land reforms better suited the agricultural peasantry than the warriors.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the post-war}} {{economic}} boom {{collapsed in the}} 1970s, and big changes in social roles occurred, these kinds of controversies stimulated a focus by social theorists on the [...] "social construction of personal identity".

The discourse <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> resonated well with the concerns of {{adolescents and young adults}} who are finding their identity, and it has been a popular subject ever since. Another reason for the popularity of the topic, noted by Richard Sennett in his book The corrosion of character, is the sheer number of different jobs people nowadays end up doing during their lifetime.
