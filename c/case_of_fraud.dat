5|$|Only {{a single}} known <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> {{involving}} a record submitted to BBRC has become public. In autumn 1994, Nigel Pepper, a birdwatcher from Essex, {{claimed to have}} recorded a hermit thrush in a garden in Chipping Ongar. Doubts about the record were raised in Birdwatch and BBRC reviewed the record in 2002, but decided that it should stand. In 2009, Pepper revealed in Birdwatch magazine (Birdwatch 204: 46-47) that the record was a deception, made in protest at perceived secrecy surrounding rare birds in the county.|$|E
5|$|Since {{substitute}} {{checks are}} considered legal checks, substitute checks {{are subject to}} existing check laws and regulations. Other laws and regulations that govern substitute checks in the United States include the Expedited Funds Availability Act, Article3 (Negotiable Instruments), and Article4 (Bank Deposits and Collections) of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), along {{with a variety of}} state and federal regulatory laws. U.S. federal laws that also affect substitute checks include Federal Reserve regulations that provide for recrediting the amount of the substitute check in the <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> and duplicate payments caused by settlement of both the substitute check and the original check used for creating the substitute check. If any state law, federal law, or provision of the UCC conflicts with the Check21Act, the Check21Act takes precedence to the extent of the inconsistencies among those laws and provisions.|$|E
25|$|The IRS is precluded from {{assessing}} {{additional tax}} {{after a certain}} period of time. In the case of federal income tax, this period is generally three years from the later of the due date of the original tax return or the date the original return was filed. The IRS has an additional three more years to make changes if the taxpayer has substantially understated gross income. The period under which the IRS may make changes is unlimited in the <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>fraud,</b> {{or in the case of}} failure to file a return.|$|E

25|$|As {{with other}} {{intentional}} torts, such liability was extended following Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd, to cover any fraud which {{is closely related}} to an employee's employment. The first <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> to be decided under this authority was Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam, involving the fraud of a senior partner in a firm of solicitors. The House of Lords chose to extend the principal liability of employers, to cover fraudulent representations made by employees with no actual or ostensible authority to make them. Here, despite the employer having made no representations to the claimants, {{it was found that the}} close connection between the partner's fraud and his duties established liability.|$|E
2500|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} prohibition was a [...] <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> involving Ieyasu's Catholic vavasor, {{but there were also}} other reasons behind it. The shogunate was concerned about a possible invasion by the Iberian colonial powers, which had previously occurred in the New World and the Philippines. Domestically, the ban was closely related to measures against the Toyotomi clan.|$|E

6000|$|While {{this was}} going on near the engine, the robbers were being removed from their {{carriage}} to receive the due reward of their deeds. Three tall and strong-boned men had been on the platform for some time awaiting the arrival of the [...] "Flying Dutchman." [...] Swift though John Marrot's iron horse was, a swifter messenger had passed on the line before him. The electric spark--and a fast volatile, free-and-easy, yet faithful spark it is--had been commissioned to do a little service that day. Half-an-hour after the train had left Clatterby a detective, wholly unconnected with our friend Sharp, had called and sent a message to London to have Thomson, Jenkins, and Smith apprehended, in consequence of their connexion with a <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>fraud</b> which had been traced to them. The three tall strong-boned men were there in virtue of this telegram. But, accustomed though these men were to surprising incidents, they had scarcely expected to find that the three culprits had added another to their many crimes, and that one of them had leaped out of the train and out of their clutches--in all probability out of the world altogether! Two of the strong men went off immediately in search of him, or his remains, while the other put proper manacles on Jenkins and Smith and carried them off in a cab.|$|E
