40|$|With {{regions and}} nations having {{formally}} fulfilled the ex ante conditionality, this book provides a first overall review of RIS 3 policy processes, aiming {{to assess the}} consistency of the concept of smart specialization from an applied, policy-oriented perspective. Moving from the theory of design to the practice of implementation, the reflections and case studies in this volume reveal strengths and weaknesses in the way concrete strategies have been conceived and implemented, enabling reflections {{on the future of the}} concept in a more general sense. In many cases, smart specialization strategies turn out to be new variants of regional development policies, embracing the importance of a place-based approach. However, the approach's potential to add distinctive value will stem from its capacity to turn innovation and knowledge into tools for local development by harnessing them for wider territorial development goals. By helping regions to identify and leverage untapped resources through new processes, smart specialization-based policies may help to reconcile cohesion and <b>competitiveness</b> <b>objective.</b> Consequently, new approaches appear most promising where institutional, administrative and political conditions allow the setup of genuinely new processes and where their focus is on territorial assets in a comprehensive manner rather than mere industrial renewal...|$|E

40|$|Background: Plant {{chemicals}} {{can affect}} reproductive strategies of tephritid fruit flies by influencing sex pheromone communication and increasing male mating <b>competitiveness.</b> <b>Objective</b> and Methodology: We explored whether exposure of Anastrepha fraterculus males to guava fruit volatiles {{and to a}} synthetic blend of volatile compounds released by this fruit affects the sexual performance of wild and laboratory flies. By means of bioassays and pheromone collection we investigated the mechanism underlying this phenomenon. Results: Guava volatile exposure enhanced male mating success and positively affected male calling behavior and pheromone release in laboratory and wild males. Changes in male behavior appear to be particularly important during the initial phase of the sexual activity period, {{when most of the}} mating pairs are formed. Exposure of laboratory males to a subset of guava fruit volatiles enhanced mating success, showing that the response to the fruit might be mimicked artificially. Conclusions: Volatiles of guava seem to influence male mating success through an enhancement of chemical and physical signals related to the communication between sexes. This finding has important implications for the management of this pest species through the Sterile Insect Technique. We discuss the possibility of using artificial blends to improve the sexual competitiveness of sterile males. Correction can be found in PLoS ONE, 10 (5), e 0129523. doi: [URL] page(s...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{it being}} a global phenomenon, there is no formal process to guide governments’ offer of {{incentives}} to industry. Specific to South Africa, the offer of incentives to the automotive industry to support its competitiveness has had mixed results. Industry trade deficit has consistently increased and investment in R&D has remained minimal. The {{purpose of the study}} was to develop a formal model to determine the effect of changes in the value and basis of the Productive Asset Allowance (PAA) incentive on industry competitiveness and on industry trade balance. An overview of the South African automotive industry, automotive policy and industry performance under the country’s Motor Industry Development Programme (MIDP) was done. This was followed by literature review on investment, investment incentives, R&D and competitiveness. Quantitative and qualitative data was collected through observer participation in the study situation and expert opinion interviews. A formal modelling process of the PAA based on the system dynamics modelling protocol followed. The PAA model had to be extended to incorporate the Import-Export Complementation (IEC) incentive structure because of the intertwined nature of the effect of PAA and IEC on industry dynamics. The study findings as per the specific study objectives were as follows: • The prospect of the PAA to support the <b>competitiveness</b> <b>objective</b> was dependent on the extent to which the incentive would motivate technological innovation in the automotive industry. • The often-assumed positive relationship between investment and investment incentives was not universal. Each case of industry incentive offer has to be judged on its own merit. • The PAA had a significant and positive effect on industry investment, but limited ability to support long-term industry competitiveness though R&D and innovative activities. • The IEC rather than the PAA incentive was the major contributor to the industry trade balance trend. • The PAA-IEC incentive model exhibited time-bound constraints. The model demonstrated saturation as benefits awarded to industry tended towards the domestic market size over time. • The PAA-IEC incentive model had no specific policy lever to direct investment into R&D and innovative activities. By this measure the model was not a strong policy framework for supporting long-term industry competitiveness. For the South African automotive industry, the study introduced and showed the usefulness of applying system dynamics modelling in understanding causes of unintended consequences of government incentives to the industry. For countries in which offer of incentives is part of the national industrial policy, the study provided scientific means through which the question of how to structure incentives can be objectively investigated as a means of improving policy decisions on such industry intervention.

The paper develops and applies a simple methodology for assessing trade competitiveness at a disaggregated industry level. The unique aspect of the approach is the attempt at incorporating existing levels, and changes in, trade performance and protection, and likely future growth in market demand. The findings provide some evidence which throws doubt on the assumption that reduced protection in manufacturing will be a substantial force in attaining the desired longer-term trade <b>competitiveness</b> <b>objectives</b> of Australian industry policy. The observed relationship between changes in protection and trade is weak and ambiguous at best. There has also been no sustained improvement in trade {{performance in}} manufacturing, total merchandise, or goods and services overall, since the early 1970 s. Furthermore, the industry groups with high competitive advantage potential in the 1970 s have not benefited from the structural readjustment accompanying reduced protection. ...|$|R
40|$|Does size matter? Is {{regional}} competitiveness {{affected by the}} region’s size? Are regional problems in Greece the same or differentiated among regions? Could an administrative reform create better development preconditions? The designation of the 13 Regions in the 80 ’s in Greece basically stemmed from the need to create development units for programming and managing the development planning. Nonetheless, the designation of regions under the effect of historical factors and political expediency led to uneven area as well as population sizes. Moreover, up to today, Greece has put its major developmental effort in the infrastructures sector, while the new 4 th programming period 2007 - 20013 imposes <b>competitiveness</b> <b>objectives</b> and an integration of the Lisbon Strategy in the Coherence policy that constitute an innovation for the Greek reality.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the Romanian rural areas from the perspective of certain indicators related to agricultural economy, employment and the quality of human resources, insisting on several of the significant problems that are slowing down rural development in Romania. These problems are discussed in relation with the objectives and the impact of national and European development strategies. The EU strategic guidelines and objectives set as a main priority the increased competitiveness of the rural economy, especially of the agricultural economy, which corresponds to the specific needs of the "old" Member States (EU 15), as reflecting a specific historical development path. In the national rural strategy, prioritizing <b>competitiveness</b> <b>objectives</b> to the detriment of market integration and modernization objectives proves to be inappropriate for the immediate challenges posed by the Romanian rural economy, where the vast majority of agricultural holdings are outside the commercial and production mechanisms of the market. This could explain the low values of implementation indicators for the national rural development plan (PNDR) measures and the low absorption rate of allocated funds and contracts concluded in relation to most measures...|$|R

In this perspective, environmental innovations appear as technological compromises which aim at combining regulatory objectives and environmental performances with productivity and <b>competitiveness</b> <b>objectives</b> of firms. The sectoral analyses presented {{in the first section}} illustrate these concepts, in particular the trajectories of clean technology and the sources of technological lock-in in the automotive industry and in green chemistry. In section 2, we focus on the role of demand and of environmental quality requirements in vertical relationships between firms. We present an evolutionary model of industrial dynamics which explicitly takes into account innovative activities of suppliers and environmental requirements of industrial clients. Simulation results underscore the determining role of demand in technological paradigm shifts, and more particularly the role of a critical mass of users characterized by high environmental requirements and high willingness to pay. environmental innovations; technological trajectories and paradigms; technological compromises; industrial dynamics and evolutionary simulation models...|$|R

40|$|This paper reviews {{growth and}} {{competitiveness}} in 94 Australian regions {{over the last}} two decades. Enterprising human capital is identified as a key determinant of regional outcomes. What we mean by regional competitiveness and enterprising human capital, and how it can be activated through engaging community and institutional behavior is explained. Recent research into the growth and competitiveness of Australian regions using multi-methods research has highlighted enterprising human capital as a key driver of regional outcomes. The multi-methods approach in the research represents a conditional interaction between econometric modeling of 94 regions and qualitative inquiry through 12 regional case study workshops. Regions seen as resilient and vulnerable to competitiveness are identified. Eight potential drivers of regional growth are examined using the Australian regional data. Regions with a good mix of positive drivers and a lower incidence of the negative driver are shown to perform more highly than others. Human capital is a key positive driver for regional growth that is latent in most regions. While creative capital and social capital are seen as important in the regional context it is enterprising human capital that holds the key to realizing outcomes. Enterprising human capital is the ability of regional residents to have an entrepreneurial capacity for knowledge activation goes beyond the âgood ideaâ or having a quality skill set.
