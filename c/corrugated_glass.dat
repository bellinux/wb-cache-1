50|$|After filming {{had already}} begun, the Hungarian {{abstract}} artist and experimental filmmaker László Moholy-Nagy was commissioned to produce {{some of the}} effects sequences for the re-building of Everytown. Moholy-Nagy's approach was partly to treat it as an abstract light show, but only some 90 seconds of material was used, e.g. a protective-suited figure behind <b>corrugated</b> <b>glass.</b> In the autumn of 1975 a researcher found a further four sequences which had been discarded.|$|E
50|$|The {{district}} {{also features}} two smaller, later automobile or auto parts retail buildings. Built in 1951 for Hoskins Pontiac, {{the building at}} 1018 Fifth Street (118-5318-0050) features a polygonal façade that is dominated by an angular metal canopy, yellow brick laid in a running bond, and polished aluminum doorframes. A service area along the Polk Street elevation is fenestrated by a short row of steel hopper windows topped by large vertical panels of thick green <b>corrugated</b> <b>glass.</b> The Burnett Tire Company building at 403 Fifth Street (118-5318-0004) was likely designed by the Lynchburg architectural firm of Cress & Johnson (Carl Cress and Stanhope S. Johnson) in 1956, and features a striking angular glass storefront that conveys a modern sense of upward movement and speed.|$|E
5000|$|Completed in 2005, the {{new home}} of the National Orchestra of Porto, the Casa da Música, stands on a new public square in the {{historic}} Rotunda da Boavista. With a distinct faceted form, New York Times critic Nicolai Ouroussoff called it [...] "a building whose intellectual ardor is matched by its sensual beauty". Inside, the elevated 1,300-seat (shoe box-shaped) Grand Auditorium has <b>corrugated</b> <b>glass</b> façades at either end that open {{the hall to the}} city and offer Porto itself as a dramatic backdrop for performances. As well as the Grand Auditorium, conceived as a simple mass hollowed out end-to-end from the solid form of the building, the Casa da Musica also contains a smaller, more flexible performance space with no fixed seating.|$|E

50|$|Laundry {{was first}} done in watercourses, letting the water carry away the {{materials}} which could cause stains and smells. Laundry is still done {{this way in}} some less industrialized areas and rural regions. Agitation helps remove the dirt, so the laundry is often rubbed, twisted, or slapped against flat rocks. Wooden bats or clubs {{could be used to}} help with beating the dirt out. These were often called washing beetles or bats and could be used by the waterside on a rock (a beetling-stone), on a block (battling-block), or on a washboard. They were once common across Europe and were also used by settlers in North America. Similar techniques have also been identified in Japan.Wooden or stone scrubbing surfaces set up near a water supply or portable washboards, including factory-made <b>corrugated</b> <b>glass</b> or metal ones, gradually replaced rocks as a surface for loosening soil.|$|E
5000|$|In 1849, Adelicia Hayes Franklin married Joseph Alexander Smith Acklen, a young {{attorney}} from Alabama, {{and they}} immediately began construction of Belle Monte (Belmont) on 180 acre in Davidson County. It {{was completed by}} 1853 as an Italian villa style summer home. Adelicia and Joseph used Belmont as a summer home {{to escape from the}} heat of Adelicia's seven Louisiana cotton plantations, which totaled 8600 acre. The Acklens built, furnished, and landscaped one of the most elaborate antebellum homes in the South, totaling 36 rooms and 19000 sq ft. The estate contained a variety of buildings with the house adorning the top of the hill. Beside the house, there was a T-shaped guest house and art gallery. The south wing of the guest house contained guestrooms and a bowling alley. The art gallery had a <b>corrugated</b> <b>glass</b> roof and comprised the north wing. The grounds also included lavish gardens, conservatories, aviary, lake and a zoo. The conservatories housed tropical fruit and flowers along with camellia japonica, jasmine, lilies, and cacti. The zoo featured bears, monkeys, peacocks, singing birds, a white owl, alligators from Louisiana and a deer park. Covered balconies with cast iron railing and trim surrounded the house to protect windows from the sun. Atop the house, a ten-foot octagonal cupola vented the house during the summer months and provided an [...] "astronomical observatory" [...] used for viewing the stars, the estate and downtown Nashville.|$|E

5000|$|Single-stream (also {{known as}} “fully commingled” or [...] "single-sort") {{recycling}} {{refers to a}} system in which all paper fibers, plastics, metals, and other containers are mixed in a collection truck, instead of being sorted by the depositor into separate commodities (newspaper, paperboard, <b>corrugated</b> fiberboard, plastic, <b>glass,</b> etc.) and handled separately throughout the collection process. In single-stream, both the collection and processing systems are designed to handle this fully commingled mixture of recyclables, with materials being separated for reuse at a materials recovery facility (MRF). The single-stream option replaces the dual-stream option, which is where people separate certain recyclable materials and place them in separate containers for collection.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{honeycomb}} made of sinusoidally <b>corrugated</b> <b>glass</b> strips was optimized {{for use in}} water-cooled, single-glazed flat plate solar collectors with non-selective black absorbers. Cell diameter (d), cell height (L), and pitch/diameter ratio (P/d) maximizing solar collector performance and cost effectiveness for given cell wall thickness (t sub w) and optical properties of glass were determined from radiative and convective honeycomb characteristics and collector performance all calculated with experimentally validated algorithms. Relative lifetime values were estimated from present materials costs and postulated production methods for <b>corrugated</b> <b>glass</b> honeycomb cover assemblies. A honeycomb with P/d = 1. 05, d = 17. 4 mm, L = 146 mm and t sub w = 0. 15 mm would provide near-optimal performance over the range delta T sub C {{greater than or equal}} to 0 C and less than or equal to 80 C and be superior in performance and cost effectiveness to a non-honeycomb collector with a 0. 92 / 0. 12 selective black absorber...|$|E

In this work, {W 2 } {{was used for the}} copolymerization of the aforementioned monomers, yielding statistical poly(norbornene) /poly(norbornadiene) PNBE/PNBD copolymers of high molecular weight and high-cis content. The composition of the polymer chain was estimated by 13 C CPMAS NMR data and {{it was found that the}} ratio of PNBE/PNBD segments in the polymer chain was relative to the monomer molar ratio in the reaction mixture. The thermal properties of all copolymers were similar, resembled the properties of PNBD homopolymer and indicated a high degree of cross-linking. The morphology of all materials in this study was smooth and non-porous; copolymers with higher PNBE content featured a <b>corrugated</b> morphology. <b>Glass</b> transition temperatures were lower for the copolymers than for the homopolymers, providing a strong indication that those materials featured a branched-shaped structure. This conclusion was further supported by viscosity measurements of copolymers solutions in THF. The molecular structure of those materials can be controlled, potentially leading to well-defined star polymers via the “core-first” synthesis method. Therefore, {W 2 } is not only a cost-efficient, practical, highly active, and cis-stereoselective ROMP-initiator, but it can also be used for the synthesis of more complex macromolecular structures...|$|R
50|$|On 21 April 1899, after {{completing}} the loading of a cargo of construction materials (steel, <b>corrugated</b> iron, and <b>glass)</b> which belonged to a San Francisco contractor given the contract to build a wharf and a coal shed at Pago Pago, Tutuila, American Samoa, and steel rods and angle irons earmarked for strengthening {{the foundations of the}} coal shed at Pago Pago, Abarenda shifted to Coal Pier No. 2 at Hampton Roads the following day, and coaled until the 24th. She departed Hampton Roads on 30 April, bound for the Pacific. En route, the ship stopped briefly at Montevideo, Uruguay, and Punta Arenas, Chile; rounded Cape Horn in rough weather (rolling as much as 30° during the passage); and visited Valparaíso, Chile; Bounty Bay, Pitcairn Island; and Tahiti, before sighting Tutuila on 9 August. She anchored in Apia Harbor the following morning, and then shifted to Pago Pago {{on the morning of the}} 13th, to soon commence unloading the cargo brought from Norfolk.|$|R
50|$|The lowset {{weatherboard}} lock-up, {{of standard}} government design, {{consists of two}} cells, an oversail veranda enclosed by a steel grill, and a galvanized corrugated steel roof with lead head nails. The lock- up stands on concrete stumps. The cells have steel doors and observation ports, with barred windows above the doors, and barred rear windows, and are lined with horizontal, unpainted boards with steel tongue inserts between them. The exterior is painted a standard government colour. Judging from its construction {{it is possible that}} it pre-dates 1934, and that it was relocated to the Pomona site.The court house is highset and clad in weatherboard, standing on concrete perimeter stumps and tubular steel centre stumps.

Its interior is clad in vertical board, and the courtroom contains the original wooden magistrates bench, witness stand and dock. A small storage room is at the back of the courtroom.|$|R
40|$|My {{knowledge}} of architecture is constrained to a coupler of idiosyncratic data: {{my love for}} Ayn Rand and her architecture-novel The Fountainhead; my admiration of the Stalinist “wedding-cake” baroque kitsch; my dream of a house composed only of secondary spaces and places of passage – stairs, corridors, toilets, store-rooms, kitchen – with no living room or bedroom. The danger that I am courting is thus that what I will say will oscillate between the two extremes of unfounded speculations and what most is already {{known for a long}} time. I would like to begin with the notion of parallax which I took from Kojin Karatani. The common definition of parallax is: the apparent displacement of an object (the shift of its position against a background), caused by a change in observational position that provides a new line of sight. The philosophical twist to be added, of course, is that the observed difference is not simply “subjective,” {{due to the fact that}} the same object which exists “out there” is seen from two different stations, or points of view. It is rather that, as Hegel would have put it, subject and object are inherently “mediated,” so that an “epistemological” shift in the subject’s point of view always reflects an “ontological” shift in the object itself. When confronted with such a parallax gap, one should renounce all attempts to reduce one aspect to the other (or, even more, to enact a kind of “dialectical synthesis” of the opposites); the task is, on the contrary, to conceive all possible positions as responses to a certain underlying deadlock or antagonism, as so many attempts to resolve this deadlock… and this already brings us to so-called postmodern architecture which, sometimes, seems to enact the notion of parallax in a directly-palpable way. Think about Liebeskind or Gehry: their work often appears as a desperate (or joyous) attempt to combine two incompatible structuring principles within the same building (in the case of Liebeskind, horizontal/vertical and oblique cubes; in the case of Gehry, traditional house with modern – concrete, <b>corrugated</b> iron, <b>glass</b> – supplements), as if two principles are locked in a struggle for hegemony...|$|R
5000|$|From {{a pool of}} 25 {{international}} architects , the BMW jury {{chose the}} very innovative design of Zaha Hadid as the final piece of the BMW plant in Leipzig, Germany. With no real precedent for her design, Zaha Hadid's Central Building can only {{be related to the}} revolutionary and monumental industrial designs of the past including Fiat Lingotto Factory by G. Matté-Trucco and the AEG Turbine Factory in Berlin by Peter Behrens. The BMW Central building is a 270000 sq ft facility that makes up only 250000 sq ft of the 540 acre campus. Serving 5,500 employees, the building functions as the most important piece of the factory, connecting the three production sheds. Each day, 650 BMW 3 Series sedans pass through the Central Building on an elevated conveyor as they move from one of the three production sheds to the next. Dim blue LED lights highlight the vehicles after each stage, as they exit one of the sheds. These conveyors not only take the vehicles from one production shed to another, but do so directly through all of the functional spaces of the Central Building. The offices, meeting rooms, and public relations facilities are all built around these elevated conveyors, creating an interesting relationship between the employees, the cars, and the public. Not only is the Central Building an office building and public relations center for the factory, it is also a very important piece of the production process at the factory. All of the load-bearing walls, floors, and office levels are made of cast-in-place concrete, while the roof structure is composed of structural steel beams and space frame construction.
