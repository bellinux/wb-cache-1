Despite its obvious usefulness in planetary geochemistry germanium is not analyzed routinely, with there being only three prior studies reporting germanium abundances in Martian meteorites. The broad range (1 - 3 ppm) observed in Martian igneous rocks is {{in stark contrast}} to the narrow range of germanium observed in terrestrial basalts (1. 5 plus or minus 0. 1 ppm). The germanium data from these studies indicates that nakhlites contain 2 - 3 ppm germanium, while shergottites contain approximately 1 ppm germanium, a dichotomy with important implications for core formation models. There have been no reliable germanium abundances on <b>chassignites.</b> The ancient meteoritic breccia, NWA 7533 (and paired meteorites) contains numerous clasts, some pristine and some impact melt rocks, that are being studied individually. Because germanium is depleted in the Martian crust relative to chondritic impactors, it has proven useful as an indicator of meteoritic contamination of impact melt clasts in NWA 7533.

The iron/manganese ratio is consistent with that of other Martian meteorites, but the oxygen isotopes do not correlate with a Martian origin. The change in oxygen isotope ratios could be explained by removal or addition of heavier or lighter isotopes, or by mixing with a mass with a different isotopic ratio.

40|$|Amphibole in <b>chassignite</b> melt {{inclusions}} provides {{valuable information}} about the volatile content of the original interstitial magma, but also shock and postshock processes. We have analyzed amphibole and other phases from NWA 2737 melt inclusions, and we evaluate these data along with published values to constrain the crystallization Cl and H 2 O content of phases in <b>chassignite</b> melt inclusions {{and the effects of}} shock on these amphibole grains. Using a model for the Cl/OH exchange between amphibole and melt, we estimate primary crystallization OH contents of <b>chassignite</b> amphiboles. SIMS analysis shows that amphibole from NWA 2737 currently has 0. 15 wt% H 2 O. It has lost ~ 0. 6 wt% H 2 O from an initial 0. 7 – 0. 8 wt% H 2 O due to intense shock. Chassigny amphibole had on average 0. 3 – 0. 4 wt% H 2 O and suffered little net loss of H 2 O due to shock. NWA 2737 amphibole has δD ≈ + 3700 ‰; it absorbed Martian atmosphere-derived heavy H in the aftermath of shock. Chassigny amphibole, with δD ≤ + 1900 ‰, incorporated less heavy H. Low H 2 O/Cl ratios are inferred for the primitive <b>chassignite</b> magma, which had significant effects on melting and crystallization.

Similarly, the source regions of the parent magmas of the nakhlite and <b>chassignite</b> meteorites differed from those on the shergottite parent body by being still richer in this volatile-rich component.

40|$|Lithium abundances and isotope {{compositions}} {{are reported}} for {{a suite of}} martian meteorites that span the range of petrological and geochemical types recognized to date for Mars. Samples include twenty-one bulk-rock enriched, intermediate and depleted shergottites, six nakhlites, two <b>chassignites,</b> the orthopyroxenite Allan Hills (ALH) 84001 and the polymict breccia Northwest Africa (NWA) 7034. Shergottites unaffected by terrestrial weathering exhibit a range in δ 7 Li from 2. 1 to 6. 2 ‰, similar to that reported for pristine terrestrial peridotites and unaltered mid-ocean ridge and ocean island basalts. Two <b>chassignites</b> have δ 7 Li values (4. 0 ‰) intermediate to the shergottite range, and combined, these meteorites provide the most robust current constraints on δ 7 Li of the martian mantle. The polymict breccia NWA 7034 has the lowest δ 7 Li (− 0. 2 ‰) of all terrestrially unaltered martian meteorites measured to date and may represent an isotopically light surface end-member. The new data for NWA 7034 imply that martian crustal surface materials had both a lighter Li isotope composition and elevated Li abundance compared with their associated mantle. These findings are supported by Li data for olivine-phyric shergotitte NWA 1068, a black glass phase isolated from the Tissint meteorite fall, and some nakhlites, which all show evidence for assimilation of a low-δ 7 Li crustal component. The range in δ 7 Li for nakhlites (1. 8 to 5. 2 ‰), and co-variations with chlorine abundance, suggests crustal contamination by Cl-rich brines. The differences in Li isotope composition and abundance between the martian mantle and estimated crust are not {{as large as the}} fractionations observed for terrestrial continental crust and mantle, suggesting a difference in the styles of alteration and weathering between water-dominated processes on Earth versus possibly Cl–S-rich brines on Mars.

40|$|The {{history of}} Pb isotope {{analyses}} of the martian meteorites (SNC) and their interpretations is laden with difficulties. Two different analytical groups have interpreted their ancient (4 Ga) shergottite Pb ages as primary [1 - 5]. A Nakhla age of approximately 4. 3 Ga has been interpreted to be primary as well [2]. This is {{in stark contrast to}} the young (1. 4 Ga) crystallization ages defined by the Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, Lu-Hf, and KAr systems [6]. Possibly, a better interpretation for the ancient Pb ages is that they reflect the formation times of the various SNC source regions [7]. A difficulty in dealing with Pb is that terrestrial contamination is ubiquitous, unlike the other chronometer systems noted above. This issue is complicated by the fact that radioactive decay causes localized mineral damage. So washing and leaching to remove Pb contamination tends to remove in situ radiogenic Pb. This issue is further compounded because U and Th are often concentrated in phosphates and other minor phases, so the leaching process tends to remove these, especially phosphates. Another difficulty is that it is not clear whether the observed Pb isotopic variation in leachates, residues, and ion-microprobe analyses is due to terrestrial or to indigenous martian Pb contamination [e. g., 8]. A third difficulty is that the shergottites on the one hand, and the nakhlites and <b>chassignites</b> on the other, appear to have come from separate source regions with different chemical compositions [e. g., 7]. Thus, it is expected that their Pb isotopic characteristics would be different. And even if all these meteorite types came from the same source region, their igneous ages differ considerably. The nakhlites and <b>chassignites</b> are ~ 1. 4 Ga and the shergottites are 600 Ma [e. g., 6]. This age difference alone should assure that the two distinct SNC groups have differing Pb isotopic signatures...|$|R

Assuming Chassigny comes from Mars and the amphiboles have not been subject to alteration after their crystallization, this result implies either that recycling of D-enriched Martian atmosphere-derived waters into the planetary interior has taken place, or that the primordial hydrogen isotopic composition of the interior of Mars differs significantly {{from that of the}} Earth (delta(D(sub SMOW)) approximately 0 percent).

Although the mg ratios range from 0. 7 to 0. 2, the silica {{contents of the}} trend are nearly constant from 47 to 53 wt%, indicating that the shergottite melts are basaltic, never andesitic nor komatiitic. The trend is enriched in FeO with the range from 15 to 22 wt%, and poor in Al_ 2 O_ 3 with the range from 4 to 14 wt%. The melts for nakhlites are poorer in SiO_ 2 and Al_ 2 O_ 3 and richer in FeO than the shergottite melt trend. Although the melts for <b>chassignite</b> {{are similar to the}} shergottite melt trend, the melts for <b>chassignite</b> and nakhlites are more enriched in K_ 2 O contents than the shergottites melts, indicating that they have a different origin from the latter. The bulk major-element compositions of terrestrial basalts, lunar basalts, and eucrites are compared to the shergottite melt trend. The terrestrial basalts and komatiites are poorer in FeO and richer in Al_ 2 O_ 3, CaO, and Na_ 2 O than the shergottite melt trend. The lunar low-Ti mare basalts and eucrites have rather similar compositions to the shergottite trend. However, their alkali and P_ 2 O_ 5 contents are low in comparison to the shergottite trend, reflecting their planetary compositions.
