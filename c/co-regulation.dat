This research predicts a common metabolic pathway that is shared by Obesity, Type- 2 Diabetes, Hypertension and Cardiovascular diseases due to metabolic disorder. A protein-protein interaction network is created to show the protein co-expression, <b>co-regulations</b> and interactions among gene and diseases. Genes whose are associated with metabolic diseases have been accumulated from different gene databases with verification and 'mined' them to establish gene interaction network models for expressing the molecular linkages among genes and diseases which affect disease progression.

50|$|<b>Co-regulation</b> {{has also}} been {{examined}} {{in the context of}} close adult relationships, though less so than in the parent-child context. Research studies conducted thus far provide preliminary support for the phenomenon. Similar to the evidence for <b>co-regulation</b> in childhood, this literature is often rooted in the attachment framework. As such, it works from the hypothesis that early experiences of <b>co-regulation</b> are internalized and guide expectations about and behavior within future close relationships. There, however, are several points of divergence between the child and adult literature on <b>co-regulation.</b> First, <b>co-regulation</b> in adult relationships is defined by reciprocity between partners, such that the responsibility to regulate the other is more or less equally split. Second, research on adult <b>co-regulation</b> is more likely to incorporate physiological measures. Indeed, physiological substrates involved in reward systems (e.g., oxytocin, opioids), are strongly activated by sexual contact, which is an added mechanism through which adults co-regulate. Third, animal models are commonly utilized in studies of <b>co-regulation</b> within adult dyads.|$|E
50|$|Inclusion of {{physiological}} measurements of <b>co-regulation</b> {{is a relatively}} recent innovation in the psychological research. The underlying premise is that, similar to observable indicators of <b>co-regulation,</b> co-regulating partners' physiology will be bidirectionally linked and subsequently stabilized. Some of these biological measures {{may be more effective}} research tools than others. More rapidly fluctuating indices, such as autonomic responses, for example, are proposed to be more temporally sensitive measures of biological <b>co-regulation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Co-regulation</b> {{is often}} {{applied in the}} context of {{emotions}}. In this sense, the emotions of each individual within a dyad are constantly in flux, depending on the emotions and behaviors of the partner. If emotion <b>co-regulation</b> is in effect, the result will be a decrease in overall emotional distress. A working definition of emotion <b>co-regulation</b> has been offered as [...] "a bidirectional linkage of oscillating emotional channels between partners, which contributes to emotional stability for both partners". Emotion <b>co-regulation</b> is thoroughly studied {{in the context of}} early emotional development, often between infants and caregivers. It has also been studied in adult interpersonal interactions, with an emphasis on close, romantic relationships. One important note regarding <b>co-regulation</b> is that there may be an imbalance within the dyad, such that one member is more actively regulating the behavior of the other.|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{development}} and increasing popularity of gene expression microarrays {{have resulted in}} a number of studies on the discovery of co-regulated genes. One important way of discovering such <b>co-regulations</b> is the query-based search since gene co-expressions may indicate a shared role in a biological process. Although there exist promising query-driven search methods adapting clustering, they fail to capture many genes that function in the same biological pathway because microarray datasets are fraught with spurious samples or samples of diverse origin, or the pathways might be regulated under only a subset of samples. On the other hand, a class of clustering algorithms known as biclustering algorithms which simultaneously cluster both the items and their features are useful while analyzing gene expression data, or any data in which items are related in only a subset of their samples. This means that genes need not be related in all samples to be clustered together. Because many genes only interact under specific circumstances, biclustering may recover the relationships that traditional clustering algorithms can easily miss. In this chapter, we briefly summarize the literature using biclustering for querying co-regulated genes. Then we present a novel biclustering approach and evaluate its performance by a thorough experimental analysis...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: As public {{microarray}} repositories {{are constantly}} growing, {{we are facing}} the challenge of designing strategies to provide productive access to the available data. METHODOLOGY: We used {{a modified version of}} the Markov clustering algorithm to systematically extract clusters of co-regulated genes from hundreds of microarray datasets stored in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (n = 1, 484). This approach led to the definition of 18, 250 transcriptional signatures (TS) that were tested for functional enrichment using the DAVID knowledgebase. Over-representation of functional terms was found in a large proportion of these TS (84 %). We developed a JAVA application, TBrowser that comes with an open plug-in architecture and whose interface implements a highly sophisticated search engine supporting several Boolean operators ([URL] User can search and analyze TS containing a list of identifiers (gene symbols or AffyIDs) or associated with a set of functional terms. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: As proof of principle, TBrowser was used to define breast cancer cell specific genes and to detect chromosomal abnormalities in tumors. Finally, taking advantage of our large collection of transcriptional signatures, we constructed a comprehensive map that summarizes gene-gene <b>co-regulations</b> observed through all the experiments performed on HGU 133 A Affymetrix platform.

40|$|Comparing large {{covariance}} matrices {{has important}} applications in modern genomics, where scientists are often interested in understanding whether relationships (e. g., dependencies or <b>co-regulations)</b> among {{a large number}} of genes vary between different biological states. We propose a computationally fast procedure for testing the equality of two large covariance matrices when the dimensions of the covariance matrices are much larger than the sample sizes. A distinguishing feature of the new procedure is that it imposes no structural assumptions on the unknown covariance matrices. Hence the test is robust with respect to various complex dependence structures that frequently arise in genomics. We prove that the proposed procedure is asymptotically valid under weak moment conditions. As an interesting application, we derive a new gene clustering algorithm which shares the same nice property of avoiding restrictive structural assumptions for high-dimensional genomics data. Using an asthma gene expression dataset, we illustrate how the new test helps compare the covariance matrices of the genes across different gene sets/pathways between the disease group and the control group, and how the gene clustering algorithm provides new insights on the way gene clustering patterns differ between the two groups. The proposed methods have been implemented in an R-package HDtest and is available on CRAN.

5000|$|As <b>co-regulation</b> is {{contingent}} on reciprocal relationships {{between members of}} a dyad, it can be compromised by risk factors within the individuals. As such, a newer line of research has identified children on the autism spectrum as a risk group for disruptions in <b>co-regulation</b> in their parent-child dyads. In the DSM-5, the first diagnostic criterion of ASD is [...] "Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts" [...] Thus, disruptions with <b>co-regulation</b> are inherent in the disorder, in that individuals with ASD exhibit difficulties in social-emotional reciprocity and sharing of emotions.

40|$|Background: The b-Zip {{transcription}} factor AtfA {{plays a key}} role in regulating stress responses in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. To identify the core regulons of AtfA, we examined genome-wide expression changes caused by various stresses in the presence/absence of AtfA using A. nidulans microarrays. We also intended to address the intriguing question regarding the existence of core environmental stress response in this important model eukaryote. Results: Examination of the genome wide expression changes caused by five different oxidative stress conditions in wild type and the atfA null mutant has identified a significant number of stereotypically regulated genes (Core Oxidative Stress Response genes). The deletion of atfA increased the oxidative stress sensitivity of A. nidulans and affected mRNA accumulation of several genes under both unstressed and stressed conditions. The numbers of genes under the AtfA control appear to be specific to a stress-type. We also found that both oxidative and salt stresses induced expression of some secondary metabolite gene clusters and the deletion of atfA enhanced the stress responsiveness of additional clusters. Moreover, certain clusters were down-regulated by the stresses tested. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the observed <b>co-regulations</b> were most likely consequences of the overlapping physiological effects of the stressors and not of the existence of a general environmental stress response. The function of AtfA in governing various stress responses is much smaller than anticipated and/or other regulators may play a redundant or overlapping role with AtfA.

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are {{responsible}} for the regulation of target genes involved in various biological processes, and may play oncogenic or tumor suppressive roles. Many studies have investigated the relationships between miRNAs and their target genes, using mRNA and miRNA expression data. However, mRNA expression levels do not necessarily represent the exact gene expression profiles, since protein translation may be regulated in several different ways. Despite this, large-scale protein expression data have been integrated rarely when predicting gene-miRNA relationships. This study explores two approaches for the investigation of gene-miRNA relationships by integrating mRNA expression and protein expression data. First, miRNAs were ranked according to their effects on cancer development. We calculated influence scores for each miRNA, {{based on the number of}} significant mRNA-miRNA and protein-miRNA correlations. Furthermore, we constructed modules containing mRNAs, proteins, and miRNAs, in which these three molecular types are highly correlated. The regulatory interactions between miRNA and genes in these modules have been validated based on the direct regulations, indirect regulations, and <b>co-regulations</b> through transcription factors. We applied our approaches to glioblastomas (GBMs), ranked miRNAs depending on their effects on GBM, and obtained 52 GBM-related modules. Compared with the miRNA rankings and modules constructed using only mRNA expression data, the rankings and modules constructed using mRNA and protein expression data were shown to have better performance. Additionally, we experimentally verified that miR- 504, highly ranked and included in the identified modules, plays a suppressive role in GBM development. We demonstrated that the integration of both expression profiles allows a more precise analysis of gene-miRNA interactions and the identification of a higher number of cancer-related miRNAs and regulatory mechanisms...|$|R

The present study investigated the systems-wide response of B. subtilis to different simultaneously imposed stresses by combining chemostat experiments under conditions of carbon and nitrogen limitation, ionic and non-ionic osmotic stress and osmoprotection with multi-omics analyses of the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and fluxome. Surprisingly, the flux through central carbon and energy metabolism is very robust under all conditions studied. The key to achieve this robustness is the increased production of several enzymes of central carbon metabolism to compensate for their reduced activity {{in the presence of}} high salt. A major response of the cell during osmotic stress is the production of the compatible solute proline through the concerted adjustment of multiple reactions around the 2 -oxoglutarate node, which drives metabolism towards the precursor glutamate. <b>Co-regulations</b> between the individual cellular components under the investigated stress conditions indicate that the fine-tuning of the transcriptional and metabolic networks involves functional modules that outreach single pathways. Additionally, the work shortly describes the salinity-decoupled fed-batch production of the compatible solute ectoine in Corynebacterium glutamicum and the contribution of precursor amino acids of the aspartate family.

Überraschenderweise ist die metabolische Flussverteilung im zentralen Kohlenstoffwechsel unter allen untersuchten Bedingungen sehr rigide.

40|$|Abstract Background The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is able {{to adapt}} and in situ detoxify {{lignocellulose}} derived inhibitors such as furfural and HMF. The length of lag phase for cell growth {{in response to the}} inhibitor challenge has been used to measure tolerance of strain performance. Mechanisms of yeast tolerance at the genome level remain unknown. Using systems biology approach, this study investigated comparative transcriptome profiling, metabolic profiling, cell growth response, and gene regulatory interactions of yeast strains and selective gene deletion mutations in response to HMF challenges during the lag phase of growth. Results We identified 365 candidate genes and found at least 3 significant components involving some of these genes that enable yeast adaptation and tolerance to HMF in yeast. First, functional enzyme coding genes such as ARI 1, ADH 6, ADH 7, and OYE 3, as well as gene interactions involved in the biotransformation and inhibitor detoxification were the direct driving force to reduce HMF damages in cells. Expressions of these genes were regulated by YAP 1 and its closely related regulons. Second, a large number of PDR genes, mainly regulated by PDR 1 and PDR 3, were induced during the lag phase and the PDR gene family-centered functions, including specific and multiple functions involving cellular transport such as TPO 1, TPO 4, RSB 1, PDR 5, PDR 15, YOR 1, and SNQ 2, promoted cellular adaptation and survival in order to cope with the inhibitor stress. Third, expressed genes involving degradation of damaged proteins and protein modifications such as SHP 1 and SSA 4, regulated by RPN 4, HSF 1, and other co-regulators, were necessary for yeast cells to survive and adapt the HMF stress. A deletion mutation strain Δrpn 4 was unable to recover the growth in the presence of HMF. Conclusions Complex gene interactions and regulatory networks as well as <b>co-regulations</b> exist in yeast adaptation and tolerance to the lignocellulose derived inhibitor HMF.

40|$|E-crimes {{continue}} to generate grave {{challenges to the}} ICT regulatory agenda. Because e-crimes involve a wrongful appropriation of information online, it is enquired whether information is property which is capable of being stolen. This then requires an investigation {{to be made of}} the law of property. The basis for this scrutiny is to establish if information is property for purposes of the law. Following a study of the Roman-Dutch law approach to property, it is argued that the emergence of an information society makes real rights in information possible. This is the position because information is one of the indispensable assets of an information society. Given the fact that information can be the object of property, its position in the law of theft is investigated. This study is followed by an examination of the conventional risks that ICTs generate. For example, a risk exists that ICTs may be used as the object of e-crimes. Furthermore, there is a risk that ICTs may become a tool in order to appropriate information unlawfully. Accordingly, the scale and impact of e-crimes is more than those of the offline crimes, for example theft or fraud. The severe challenges that ICTs pose to an information society are likely to continue if clarity is not sought regarding: whether ICTs can be regulated or not, if ICTs can be regulated, how should an ICT regulatory framework be structured? A study of the law and regulation for regulatory purposes reveals that ICTs are spheres where regulations apply or should apply. However, better regulations are appropriate in dealing with the dynamics of these technologies. Smart-regulations, meta-regulations or reflexive regulations, self-regulations and <b>co-regulations</b> are concepts that support better regulations. Better regulations enjoin the regulatory industries, for example the state, businesses and computer users to be involved in establishing ICT regulations. These ICT regulations should specifically be in keeping with the existing e-authentication measures. Furthermore, the codes-based theory, the Danger or Artificial Immune Systems (the AIS) theory, the Systems theory and the Good Regulator Theorem ought to inform ICT regulations. The basis for all this should be to establish a holistic approach to e-authentication. This approach must conform to the Precautionary Approach to E-Authentication or PAEA. PAEA accepts the importance of legal rules in the ICT regulatory agenda. However, it argues that flexible regulations could provide a suitable framework within which ICTs and the ICT risks are controlled. In addition, PAEA submit that a state should not be the single role-player in ICT regulations.
