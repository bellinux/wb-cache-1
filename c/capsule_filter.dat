40|$|The EPA method 1623 is {{designed}} specifically {{for the detection of}} Cryptosporidium and Giardia, but the method has some issues with low and variable recoveries. Ultrafiltration has been used effectively for microorganism recovery from water samples but is not approved by the EPA. To determine the efficacy of using ultrafiltration, 10 -L tap water and surface water samples were seeded with Cryptosporidium and Giardia and concentrated with either a pleated <b>capsule</b> <b>filter</b> or a hollow-fiber ultrafilter. For Cryptosporidum, oocyst recovery in tap water was significantly higher for ultrafiltration (68 %) versus the <b>capsule</b> <b>filter</b> (37 %); ultrafiltration recovered 65 % of oocysts in surface water versus 61 % for the <b>capsule</b> <b>filter.</b> However, Giardia cyst recovery was mixed. In tap water, the <b>capsule</b> <b>filter</b> produced a significantly better recovery (85 %) of Giardia compared with ultrafiltration (63 %), but the surface water ultrafiltration recovery (81 %) was significantly better than the <b>capsule</b> <b>filter</b> recovery (40 %). Overall, ultrafiltration recoveries were equal to or better for Cryptosporidium, but recoveries of Giardia were varied depending on the filter used and the type of water analyzed.

40|$|The aim {{of present}} work {{was to develop}} a stable Cytarabine {{injectable}} formulation for the treatment of various cancers. Cytarabine is freely soluble and stable in water. Different compatibility studies of Cytarabine formulation was carried out. The fluororesin coated chlorobutyl rubber stopper was given least % impurities as compare to bromobutyl and teflon coated rubber stoppers. The platinum cured silicon tubing of Masterflex was observed the best suitable tubing in terms of % impurities. The filter made of the Polyethersulfone (PES) was compatible with Cytarabine formulation in terms of % impurities and loss of drug during filtration. Thermal cycling was performed at 40 °C for 4 days and there was found that there was no significant decrease in assay and related substances. Filter validation was carried out with PES <b>capsule</b> <b>filter</b> and it was found to be compatible with Cytarabine formulation. Chemical stability of Cytarabine formulation with infusion solutions was performed and (0. 9 % NaCl, 5 % Dextrose & Water) it was observed that the final solution for injection was stable after 5 days.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{occurrence}} of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts in reclaimed effluents if method 1623 with the Envirochek capsule filters (standard and high-volume [HV] filters) and {{a modified version of}} the Information Collection Rule method (ICR) with the polypropylene yarn-wound cartridge filter are used. The recovery efficiency of the analytical methods was evaluated with samples of reagent, tap, and reclaimed water by using flow cytometer-sorted spike suspensions. (Oo) cyst recovery efficiency determined filter performance and method reproducibility in the water matrix tested. Method 1623 with the Envirochek HV <b>capsule</b> <b>filter</b> generated significantly higher recovery rates than did the standard Envirochek filter and the modified ICR method. Notwithstanding, large variations in recovery rates (> 80 %) occurred with samples of reclaimed water, and none of the water quality parameters analyzed in the reclaimed effluents could explain such variability. The highest concentrations of indigenous oocysts were detected by method 1623 with the HV filter, which provided a sufficient number of oocysts for further confirmation of infectious potential. Confir-mation of species and potential infectivity for all positive protozoan samples was made by using a nested PCR restriction fragment polymorphism assay and the focus detection method most-probable-number assay, re-spectively. The methodology and results described in the present investigation provide useful information for the establishment of pathogen numeric standards for reclaimed effluents used for unrestricted irrigation...|$|E

40|$|Bench-scale {{dissolved}} air flotation (DAF) of Tagus River surface water (Valadas, Portugal) was investigated as pre-treatment for spiral-wound module nanofiltration (SWNF). Before the DAF, a coagulation/flocculation of the surface water was performed using aluminium sulphate, ferric chloride and chitosan coagulants and several commercial coagulant aids. The coagulation/flocculation experiments were carried with 2 L of surface water in a jartest equipment at room temperature. The DAF performance to remove colloidal matter and suspended solids was evaluated through the measurement of the silt density index (SDI) and the modified fouling index (MFI) of the treated water. The air saturation pressure was varied between 300 and 600 kPa and the recycle ratio between 5 and 50 %. The DAF without coagulation/flocculation was not effective in the reduction of both the SDI and MFI, even at a high DAF recycle ratio of 50 %. The use of coagulants improved the DAF efficacy in reducing the fouling indexes and, for the optimal operating conditions, the MFI of the treated water was reduced {{by more than one}} order of magnitude. However, {{it was not possible to}} obtain treated water with SDI and MFI values below the recommended ones for SWNF. Further filtration of the DAF treated water with a 5 micron <b>capsule</b> <b>filter</b> was necessary to reduce the SDI below 5 %/min and the MFI below 10 s/l 2.

40|$|The {{protozoan}} parasite Cryptosporidium parvum {{is known}} to occur widely in both source and drinking water and has caused waterborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis. To improve monitoring, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency developed method 1622 for isolation and detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts in water. Method 1622 is performance based and involves filtration, concentration, immunomagnetic separation, fluorescent-antibody staining and 4 ′, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI) counterstaining, and microscopic evaluation. The <b>capsule</b> <b>filter</b> system currently recommended for method 1622 was compared to a hollow-fiber ultrafilter system for primary concentration of C. parvum oocysts in seeded reagent water and untreated surface waters. Samples were otherwise processed according to method 1622. Rates of C. parvum oocyst recovery from seeded 10 -liter volumes of reagent water in precision and recovery experiments with filter pairs were 42 % (standard deviation [SD], 24 %) and 46 % (SD, 18 %) for hollow-fiber ultrafilters and capsule filters, respectively. Mean oocyst recovery rates in experiments testing both filters on seeded surface water samples were 42 % (SD, 27 %) and 15 % (SD, 12 %) for hollow-fiber ultrafilters and capsule filters, respectively. Although C. parvum oocysts were recovered from surface waters by using the approved filter of method 1622, the recovery rates were significantly lower and more variable than those from reagent grade water. In contrast, the disposable hollow-fiber ultrafilter system was compatible with subsequent method 1622 processing steps, and it recovered C. parvum oocysts from seeded surface waters with significantly greater efficiency and reliability than the filter suggested {{for use in the}} version of method 1622 tested...|$|E
40|$|Published {{accounts}} of Crassostrea iredalei are only of its {{distribution in the}} Philippines. In Indonesia, this species is known to occur {{on the coast of}} South Sulawesi as well as in Banten. The purposes of the present studies were to investigate effect of salinity, temperature and food value of four microalgae to C. iredalei larval growth. Fine filtration of water was carried out using Sartorius <b>capsule</b> <b>filter</b> cartridge (1. 2 ìm and 0. 2 ìm) and sterilization was achieved by passing the water through an ultraviolet light unit. Low-salinity water was prepared by diluting filtered seawater with distilled water. High-salinity water was made by adding synthetic sea salts. All cultures were kept in constant temperature baths. Experiments of 8 -days (for temperature and salinity trials) and 10 -days (for diet trial) duration were duplicated in 500 mL glass beakers with larval density of 104 per liter. Seawater was changed every 48 h. The algae, Isochrysis galbana, I. galbana clone T-ISO, and Pavlova lutheri were added to the glass beakers at a rate of 100 cells/ìL; cell density of Chaetoceros calsitrans was 250 cells/ìl {{at the start of the}} experiment and after every water change. Using thermostat chambers, 5 temperatures were tested, ranging from 14 o to 34 o in 5 steps. Four salinities were used, they ranged from 10 to 35 ‰ in 5 ‰ steps. For environmental condition trial, I. galbana as food was used. In diet trials, 4 species of algae were tested e. g. I. galbana, I. galbana T-ISO, P. lutheri, C. calcitrans and a mixture of algae, T-ISO/C. calcitrans. The optimum salinity range for growth of larvae was recorded at 20 ‰— 30 ‰ at which the mean shell length was 85. 1 — 87. 7 ìm. The highest survival rate was recorded at salinity of 25 ‰— 30 ‰, it was 91. 6 %— 92. 7 %. There were significant differences in larval growth between temperature treatments. The optimum temperature for larval growth was at 24 °C— 29 °C, with survival rate of 91. 6 %— 93. 0 %. P. lutheri and I. galbana proved to be of equal value as diet for larval growth, with survival rates of 89. 4 %— 90. 6 %.

40|$|Introduction  Since {{being brought}} to market in 2007, {{cigarettes}} with <b>capsules</b> in the <b>filter</b> that can be burst to change the flavor have had remarkable global success, highlighting the importance of product innovation for tobacco companies. Very few studies have explored how these products are perceived by smokers however. This paper sought to address this gap by exploring smokers’ awareness of cigarettes {{with one or two}} flavor-changing <b>capsules</b> in the <b>filter</b> and the appeal of these products.   Methods  Twenty focus groups were conducted in Glasgow and Edinburgh in 2015 with current smokers (N= 120), segmented by age (16 – 17, 18 – 24, 25 – 35, 36 – 50, > 50), gender, and social grade.   Results  Awareness, use and appeal of capsule cigarettes was greater among younger adults (16 – 35 years), who showed most interest in these products. Those who perceived capsules positively mentioned multiple benefits: the ability to burst the capsule, convenience of being able to share cigarettes among menthol and nonmenthol smokers, better taste, fresher breath, reduced smell, and greater discretion. It was suggested that capsule cigarettes, particularly the double capsule cigarette (which had two differently flavored <b>capsules</b> in the <b>filter),</b> would encourage nonsmokers to experiment with smoking and discourage smokers from quitting.   Conclusions  The findings offer some reasons behind the global growth of the capsule cigarette segment.   Implications  Cigarettes with flavor-changing <b>capsules</b> in the <b>filter</b> {{have been one of the}} most successful product innovations of the last decade for tobacco companies. They have received very little academic attention however. Employing focus groups with 120 smokers aged 16 and over, we found that capsule cigarettes held most appeal to, and were considered to be targeted at, younger people, with it suggested that these products would encourage initiation and discourage cessation.

40|$|Relatively {{few studies}} have {{examined}} recoveries from source waters by using Environmental Protection Agency method 1623 with organism spike doses that are environmentally realistic and at turbidity levels commonly found in surface waters. In this study, we evaluated the filtration capacities and recovery efficiencies of the Gelman Envirochek (standard filter) and the Gelman Envirochek high-volume (HV) sampling capsules under environmental conditions. We also examined the performance of method 1623 under ambient conditions with matrix spike experiments using 10 organisms/liter. Under turbid conditions, the HV <b>capsule</b> <b>filtered</b> approximately twice the volume filtered by the standard filter, but neither could filter 10 liters without clogging. In low-turbidity waters, oocyst, but not cyst, recoveries were significantly higher when the HV capsule was used. In turbid waters, organism recoveries were lower than those in nonturbid waters and were not significantly different for the different filters. When the HV capsule was used, Cryptosporidium recoveries ranged from 36 to 75 %, and Giardia recoveries ranged from 0. 5 to 53 %. For both organisms, recoveries varied significantly by site. Turbidity could explain variation in Giardia recoveries (r 2 = 0. 80) but not variation in Cryptosporidium recoveries (r 2 = 0. 16). The inconsistent recoveries across sites suggested that the background matrix of the ambient water affected recovery by method 1623. A control sample collected {{at the height of the}} winter rainy season detected one organism, highlighting the difficulty of using this method to accurately measure pathogen abundance under natural conditions. Our findings support the use of the HV filter under field conditions but suggest that designing a cost-effective and statistically valid monitoring program to evaluate sources and loads of protozoan pathogens may be difficult...|$|R

Waterborne cryptosporidiosis {{has been identified as}} an emerging public health problem. This parasite is resistant to most currently used water disinfectants and no effective spécifie treatment has been available. Infectivity of oocysts recovered from waters should be evaluated for estimating the risks of contamination. Variable importance in outbreaks and significance in distribution had been documented for subgenotypes of C. parvum. In the present study, A NMRI-suckling mice model was developed for evaluation of infectivity of C. parvum oocysts and in vitro excystation was measured as viability. Infectivity of fourteen isolates of C. panwm oocysts were investigated and all were infective to suckling mice. Influence of temperature and durations of storage on viability, infectivity and morphology of oocysts were studied. Infectivity of oocysts stored at + 10 C decreased more rapidly than that of those stored at + 4 C, more contracted size and more changes in external wall structure were observed on oocysts stored at + 10 C. Using polypropylene cartridge filter and Gelman Envirochek <b>capsule</b> <b>filters,</b> local environmental waters and local distribution waters were filtered respectively. C. parvum oocysts were detected in the condensed water samples by IFA. C. parvum oocysts were also found from condensed mussel (Mytilus edulis) tissues by IFA, IMS and PCR-sequencing. Curative anticryptosporidial activity of nitazoxanide (NTZ) was evaluated in an immunosuppressed rat model and compared with the effects of sinefungin (SNF) and paromomycin (PRM). Although the inhibition rate was lower than that of SNF and PRM, NTZ exerted a long-lasting curative anti-C. parrwm activity in the immunosuppressed rat. Using the 18 S rDNA primers, PCR were performed on 6 isolates of C. par-tiwm oocysts from clinic AIDS patients, 1 isolate from experimentally infected calf and 2 isolates from mussels.

The legislation was phased in between May 2016 and May 2017. Our objective was to monitor pack, brand and product changes pre- and post-implementation.   Methods Our surveillance of the cigarette market involved a review of the trade press, a monthly monitor of online supermarkets, and regular visits to stores, from May 2015 to June 2017.   Results Pre-standardised packaging there were changes to the pack graphics (e. g. redesigned packs and limited-editions) and pack structure (e. g. re-sealable inner foil), and the issue of a number of re-usable tins. Post-standardised packaging, changes included newer cigarette pack sizes for some brand variants (e. g. 23 and 24 packs). Changes to the branding pre-standardised packaging included brand extensions, and post-standardised packaging included brand and/or variant name change, often with the inclusion of colour descriptors, and brand migrations. Product changes pre-standardised packaging included the introduction of novel filters (e. g. filters with two flavour-changing <b>capsules,</b> tube <b>filters,</b> firmer filters, and filters with granular additives).

40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} {{for personal}} sampling for inhalable aerosol hazards is constrained by issues of sampler cost and complexity; these issues have limited the adoption {{and use of}} some samplers by practicing hygienists. Thus, despite the known health effects of inhalable aerosol hazards, personal exposures are routinely assessed for {{only a small fraction}} of the at-risk workforce. To address the limitations of current technologies for inhalable aerosol sampling, a disposable inhalable aerosol sampler was developed and evaluated in the laboratory. The new sampler is designed to be less expensive and simpler to use than existing technologies. The sampler incorporates a lightweight internal capsule fused to the sampling filter. This capsule-filter assembly allows for the inclusion of particles deposited on the internal walls and inlet, thus minimizing the need to wash or wipe the interior sampling cassette when conducting gravimetric analyses. Sampling efficiency and wall losses were tested in a low-velocity wind tunnel with particles ranging from 9. 5 to 89. 5. The results were compared to the proposed low-velocity inhalability criterion as well as published data on the IOM sampler. Filter weight stability and time-to-equilibrium were evaluated as these factors affect the practicality of a design. Preliminary testing of the new sampler showed good agreement with both the IOM and the proposed low-velocity inhalability curve.

40|$|Metals {{transport}} in the Sacramento River, northern California, {{was evaluated}} {{on the basis}} of samples of water, suspended colloids, streambed sediment, and caddisfly larvae that were collected on one to six occasions at 19 sites in the Sacramento River Basin from July 1996 to June 1997. Four of the sampling periods (July, September, and November 1996; and May–June 1997) took place during relatively low-flow conditions and two sampling periods (December 1996 and January 1997) took place during high-flow and flooding conditions; respectively. Tangential-flow ultrafiltration with 10, 000 nominal molecular weight limit, or daltons (0. 005 micrometer equivalent), pore-size membranes was used to separate metals in streamwater into ultrafiltrate (operationally defined dissolved fraction) and retentate (colloidal fraction) components, respectively. Conventional filtration with <b>capsule</b> <b>filters</b> (0. 45 micrometer pore-size) and membrane filters (0. 40 micrometer pore-size) and totalrecoverable analysis of unfiltered (whole-body) samples were done for comparison at all sites. Because the total-recoverable analysis involves an incomplete digestion of particulate matter, a more reliable measurement of whole-water concentrations is derived from the sum of the dissolved component that is based on the ultrafiltrate plus the suspended component that is based on a total digestion of colloid concentrates from the ultrafiltration retentate. Metals in caddisfly larvae were determined for whole-body samples and cytosol extracts, which are intercellular solutions that provide a more sensitive indication of the metals that have been bioaccumulated. Trace metals in acidic, metal-rich drainage from abandoned and inactive sulfide mines were observed to enter the Sacramento River system (specifically, into both Shasta Lake and Keswick Reservoir) in predominantly dissolved form, as operationally defined using ultrafiltrates. The predominant source of acid mine drainage to Keswick Reservoir is Spring Creek, which drains the Iron Mountain mine area. Copper concentrations in filtered samples from Spring Creek taken during December 1996, January 1997, and May 1997 ranged from 420 to 560 micrograms per liter. Below Keswick Dam, copper concentrations in conventionally filtered samples ranged from 0. 5 micrograms per liter during September 1996 to 9. 4 micrograms per liter during January 1997; the latter concentration exceeded the applicable water-quality standard. The proportion of trace metals that was dissolved (versus colloidal) in samples collected at Shasta and Keswick dams decreased in the order cadmium ≈ zinc 3 ̆e copper 3 ̆e aluminum ≈ iron ≈ lead ≈ mercury. At four sampling sites on the Sacramento River at various distances downstream of Keswick Dam (Bend Bridge, 71 kilometers; Colusa, 256 kilometers; Verona, 360 kilometers; and Freeport, 412 kilometers) concentrations of these seven metals were predominantly colloidal during both high- and low-flow conditions. Because copper compounds are used extensively as algaecides in rice farming, agricultural drainage at the Colusa Basin Drain was sampled in June 1997 during a period shortly after copper applications to newly planted rice fields. Copper concentrations ranged from 1. 3 to 3. 0 micrograms per liter in filtered samples and from 12 to 13 micrograms per liter in whole-water samples (total recoverable analysis). These results are consistent with earlier work by the U. S. Geological Survey indicating that copper in rice-field drainage likely represents a detectable, but relatively minor source of copper to the Sacramento River. Lead isotope data from suspended colloids and streambed sediments collected during October and November 1996 indicate that lead from acid mine drainage sources became a relatively minor component of the total lead at the site located 71 kilometers downstream of Keswick Dam and beyond. Cadmium, copper, and zinc concentrations in caddisfly larvae were elevated at several sites downstream of Keswick Dam, but concentrations of aluminum, iron, lead, and mercury were relatively low, especially in the cytosol extracts. Cadmium showed the highest degree of bioaccumulation in whole-body and cytosol analyses, relative to an unmineralized control site (Cottonwood Creek).

The capsule cigarette was then discussed in depth. The pink coloured cigarette and slim cigarettes created significant interest and were generally perceived as most appealing and pleasant tasting, and least harmful. The black aromatized cigarette received a mixed response, with some disliking the dark colour and associating it with low appeal, strong taste and increased harm, whereas for others the smell helped to enhance appeal and taste perceptions and lower perceptions of harm. The novel capsule cigarette, when discussed in-depth, was viewed very positively. Just as research shows that cigarette packs can influence perceptions of appeal, harm and taste, {{this study suggests that}} the actual cigarettes can do likewise. The findings have implications for tobacco education and policy...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{quantify}} the precision of coal mine dust concentration measurements made with state-of-the-art gravimetric techniques and samplers incorporating flow control technology. Using a specially designed, portable dust chamber, twenty-two tests were conducted in an underground coal mine. Each test consisted of collecting 16 simultaneous dust samples, using 16 coal mine dust sampler units, symmetrically mounted in a container with a central inlet. Dust <b>filter</b> <b>capsules</b> were weighed in the same laboratory before and after exposure, with pre- and post-exposure weights recorded to the nearest µg (0. 001 mg). The average weight gain observed within tests ranged from 62 µg, collected over a 325 -minute sampling period, to 6750 µg, collected over 320 minutes. Based on a weighted least squares, repeated measures regression analysis, a point estimate for the standard deviation of error in recorded weight gain is 9. 1 µg, with an upper one-tailed 95 %-confidence limit (UCL) of 10. 3 µg. The corresponding estimate of measurement imprecision deriving from other sources (including inter-sampler variability) is 4. 3 percent (UCL = 6. 8 %). For dust samples collected over a 480 -minute period, this results in an estimate of overall measurement imprecisio...|$|R
40|$|Closed-face 37 -mm {{polystyrene}} cassettes {{are often}} used for exposure monitoring of metal particulates. Several methods have been proposed {{to account for the}} wall loss in air sampling cassettes, including rinsing, wiping, within-cassette dissolution, and an internal capsule fused to the filter that could be digested with the <b>filter.</b> Until internal <b>capsules</b> replace <b>filters,</b> other methods for assessing wall losses may be considered. To determine if rinsing and wiping or wiping alone is adequate to determine wall losses on cassettes, we collected 54 full-shift area air samples at a battery recycling facility. We collected six replicate samples at three locations within the facility for three consecutive days. The wall losses of three replicate cassettes from each day-location were analyzed following a rinse and two consecutive wipes. The wall losses of the other three replicates from each day-location were analyzed following two consecutive wipes only. Mixed-cellulose ester membrane filter, rinse, and wipes were analyzed separately following NIOSH Method 7303. We found an average of 29 % (range: 8 - 54 %) recovered lead from the cassette walls for all samples. We also found that rinsing prior to wiping the interior cassette walls did not substantially improve recovery of wall losses compared to wiping alone. A rinse plus one wipe recovered on average 23 % (range: 13 - 33 %) of the lead, while one wipe alone recovered on average 21 % (range: 16 - 22 %). Similarly, we determined that a second wipe did not provide substantial additional recovery of lead (average: 4 %, range: 0. 4 - 19 %) compared to the first wipe disregarding the rinse (average: 18 %, range: 4 - 39 %). We concluded that when an internal capsule is not used, wall losses of lead dust in air sampling cassettes can be adequately recovered by wiping the internal wall surfaces of the cassette with a single wipe.

40|$|Many {{naturally}} occurring materials are autofluorescent, a property that {{can reduce the}} discriminative ability of fluorescence methods, sometimes {{to the point where}} they cannot be usefully applied. Shifting from the spectral to the temporal domain, it is possible to discriminate fluorophores on the basis of their fluorescence decay lifetime. Luminophores with sufficiently long lifetimes can be discriminated from short-lived autofluorescence using time-gated luminescence (TGL). This technique relies upon the application of a brief excitation pulse followed by a resolving period to permit short-lived autofluorescence to decay, after which detection is enabled to capture persistent emission. In our studies, a high-power UV LED was mounted in the <b>filter</b> <b>capsule</b> of an Olympus BX 51 microscope to serve as the excitation source. The microscope was fitted with an Andor DV 885 electron-multiplying CCD (EM-CCD) camera with the trigger input synchronized to UV LED operation. Giardia lamblia cysts labeled with the europium chelate BHHST were analyzed against an autofluorescent background with the TGL microscope. The EM-CCD camera captured useful TGL images in real time with a single exposure cycle. With 4 x frame averaging, images acquired in TGL mode showed a 30 -fold improvement in SNR compared with conventional fluorescence microscopy. 6 page(s...|$|R
40|$|A {{polyvinyl}} chloride (PVC) cassette insert with PVC filter (ACCU-CAP) in a 37 -mm closed-face cassette (CFC) {{was designed for}} gravimetric analysis. A customized version of the ACCU-CAP, also {{to be used in}} the CFC, was manufactured from an acid-digestible cellulose-acetate cassette insert joined to a mixed cellulose ester (MCE) filter for wet chemical analysis. The aim of this study was to compare metal particle concentrations as sampled by the customized insert (CI) in a CFC sampler with the traditional sampling method using only a MCE filter in the CFC. Thirty-nine personal and 13 area samples were taken using paired filter-based CFC and the CI in CFC samplers at a solder manufacturing plant. The CI was removed from its CFC, and digested and analyzed as a whole. The MCE filter from the typical CFC was removed for analysis and then the interior of the cassette was wiped with Ghost Wipe for a separate analysis. The MCE filter only, Ghost Wipe, and CI were separately dissolved in heated nitric acid for ICP-MS analysis. Overall, the geometric mean concentration of the filter-only (FO) samples was considerably lower than that of the CI samples, by 53 % for lead and 32 % for tin. However, if the FO analysis was added to the corresponding Ghost Wipe analysis, i. e., filter+interior wipe (FW), the geometric mean concentrations of the FW results were similar to those of the CI results (by 113 % for lead and 98 % for tin). For both lead and tin the comparison of (log-transformed) metal concentrations between the FW and CI results showed no statistically significant difference (p-value = 0. 3009 for lead and 0. 800 for tin), while the comparison between the FO and CI results shows statistically significant differences (all p-values < 0. 05). In conclusion, incorporating the sampler internal non-filter deposits by wiping or use of an internal <b>filter</b> <b>capsule</b> gave higher results than analyzing only the filter. Close agreement between the two methods of including non-filter deposits is an indication of general equivalency.
