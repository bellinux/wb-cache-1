40|$|Documenting {{the long}} term impact <b>of</b> <b>structural</b> <b>policies</b> on {{economic}} performance has generated tremendous interest in the development literature. In contrast, contemporary effects <b>of</b> <b>structural</b> <b>policies</b> are difficult to establish. <b>Structural</b> <b>policies</b> seldom change sufficiently in the short run, and accepted instruments to control for endogeneity in cross sections are inappropriate for time series analysis. In this paper we utilize an eleven year panel of 26 transition countries to identify short term effects <b>of</b> <b>structural</b> <b>policies</b> that are large and significant. A ten percent change in the quality <b>of</b> <b>structural</b> <b>policies</b> (or the Rule of Law) towards OECD standards is shown to raise annual growth by about 2. 5 %.

40|$|The article {{contains}} a presentation {{of the main elements}} of the concept <b>of</b> regional <b>structural</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> the Federal Republic of Germany. A point of departure for the analysis is a defnition of role and place <b>of</b> the regional <b>structural</b> <b>policy</b> within economic sciences. It allows to determine its role and scope, goals of particular entities and applied instruments. The regional <b>structural</b> <b>policy</b> holds a permanent place in the German economic thought as a part o f the economic policy pursued by the State. A specific character of the federal state implies special regulations concerning the problem of subjectiveness. Goals <b>of</b> the regional <b>structural</b> <b>policy</b> ensue from the pyramid of goals accepted within the framework of social market economy doctrine. The instruments applied have been subordinated to these goals.
