5|$|The {{metric system}} was first {{implemented}} during the French Revolution (1790s) {{with just the}} metre and kilogram as standards of length and mass respectively.

In the 1860s a group working {{under the auspices of}} the British Association for the Advancement of Science formulated the requirement for a <b>coherent</b> <b>system</b> of units with base units and derived units. The inclusion of electrical units into the system was hampered by the customary use of more than one set of units, until 1900 when Giovanni Giorgi identified the need to define one single electrical quantity as a fourth base quantity alongside the original three base quantities.|$|E

5|$|In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell, William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) {{and others}} {{working under the}} auspices of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, built on Gauss' work and formalised the concept of a <b>coherent</b> <b>system</b> of units with base units and derived units. The {{principle}} of coherence was successfully used to define a number of units of measure based on the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS), including the erg for energy, the dyne for force, the barye for pressure, the poise for dynamic viscosity and the stokes for kinematic viscosity.|$|E
5|$|The International System of Units (abbreviated as SI, {{from the}} French Système {{international}} (d'unités)) is the modern {{form of the}} metric system, and is {{the most widely used}} system of measurement. It comprises a <b>coherent</b> <b>system</b> of units of measurement built on seven base units and a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system also specifies lowercase names for 22 derived units.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the BIPM had custody of two artefacts – one to define length and the other to define mass. Other units of measure which did not rely on specific artefacts were controlled by other bodies. In the scientific world, quantum theory was in its infancy and Einstein had yet to publish his theories of relativity. By the end of the century, a <b>coherent</b> <b>system</b> of units was in place under the control of the bodies set up by the Convention du Mètre (Metre Convention), the definition of the second relied on quantum theory, the definition of the metre relied on the theory of relativity, and plans were being made to relegate the international prototype kilogram to the archives.|$|E

5|$|Beliefs in {{the divine}} and in the afterlife were {{ingrained}} in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule {{was based on the}} divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a <b>coherent</b> <b>system.</b> These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.|$|E
5|$|The SI base {{units are}} the {{building}} blocks of the system and all other units are derived from them. When Maxwell first introduced the concept of a <b>coherent</b> <b>system,</b> he identified three quantities that could be used as base units: mass, length and time. Giorgi later identified the need for an electrical base unit. Theoretically any one of electric current, potential difference, electrical resistance, electrical charge or a number of other quantities could have provided the base unit, with the remaining units then being defined by the laws of physics. In the event, the unit of electric current was chosen for SI. Another three base units (for temperature, substance and luminous intensity) were added later.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the view that}} science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a <b>coherent</b> <b>system.</b> Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified. A prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} and implementation complexity of coherent and of noncoherent QPSK and GMSK modulation/demodulation techniques {{in a complex}} mobile satellite systems environment, including large Doppler shift, delay spread, and low C/I, are compared. We demonstrate that for large f(sub d) T(sub b) products, where f(sub d) is the Doppler shift and T(sub b) is the bit duration, noncoherent (discriminator detector or differential demodulation) systems have a lower BER floor than their coherent counterparts. For significant delay spreads, e. g., tau(sub rms) greater than 0. 4 T(sub b), and low C/I, <b>coherent</b> <b>systems</b> outperform noncoherent systems. However, the synchronization time of <b>coherent</b> <b>systems</b> is longer than that of noncoherent systems. Spectral efficiency, overall capacity, and related hardware complexity issues of these systems are also analyzed. We demonstrate that <b>coherent</b> <b>systems</b> have a simpler overall architecture (IF filter implementation-cost versus carrier recovery) and are more robust in an RF frequency drift environment. Additionally, the prediction tools, computer simulations, and analysis of <b>coherent</b> <b>systems</b> is simpler. The threshold or capture effect in low C/I interference environment is critical for noncoherent discriminator based systems. We conclude with a comparison of hardware architectures of coherent and of noncoherent systems, including recent trends in commercial VLSI technology and direct baseband to RF transmit, RF to baseband (0 -IF) receiver implementation strategies...|$|R
500|$|From its inception, {{the metric}} system was {{designed}} {{in such a}} manner that the various units of measure were linked to each other. At the start of the nineteenth century, length, mass, time and temperature were the only base unit units that were defined in terms of formal standards. The beginnings of a <b>coherent</b> <b>system</b> were in place with the units of area and volume linked to the unit of length, though at the time science did not understand the concepts of base units and derived units, nor how many physical quantities were inter-related. This concept, which enabled thermal, mechanical, electrical and relativistic systems to be interlinked was first formally proposed in 1861 using length, mass and time as base units. [...] The absence of an electrical base unit resulted {{in a number of different}} electrical systems being developed in the latter half of the nineteenth century. The need for such a unit to resolve these problems was identified by Giorgi in 1901. The SI standard which was published in 1960 defined a single <b>coherent</b> <b>system</b> based on six units.|$|E
500|$|In 1837 {{the metric}} system was re-adopted by France, and also {{during the first}} half of the 19th century was adopted by the {{scientific}} community. In the middle of the century, James Clerk Maxwell put forward the concept of a <b>coherent</b> <b>system</b> where a small number of units of measure were defined as base units, and all other units of measure, called derived units, were defined in terms of the base units. Maxwell proposed three base units: length, mass and time. This concept worked well with [...] mechanics, but attempts to describe electromagnetic forces in terms of these units encountered difficulties. By the end of the 19th century, four principal variants of the metric system were in use for the measurement of electromagnetic phenomena: three based on the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS system), and one on the metre-kilogram-second system of units (MKS system). This impasse was resolved by Giovanni Giorgi, who in 1901 proved that a <b>coherent</b> <b>system</b> that incorporated electromagnetic units had to have an electromagnetic unit as a fourth base unit.|$|E
