5|$|A 2002 {{research}} paper on machine vision by <b>computer</b> <b>scientists</b> Roman Goldenberg, Ron Kimmel, Ehud Rivlin, and Michael Rudzsky used Futurism's techniques of motion, as embodied by Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash, {{to illustrate the}} mathematical representation of periodic motion using {{a small number of}} eigenshapes.|$|E
5|$|Academic <b>computer</b> <b>scientists</b> were {{generally}} uninterested in business applications when COBOL was created {{and were not}} involved in its design; it was (effectively) designed from the ground up as a computer language for business, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only data types were numbers and strings of text.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, North American Falun Gong <b>computer</b> <b>scientists</b> began {{developing}} circumvention and annonymizing {{tools to}} enable those in mainland China to access information on Falun Gong.

5|$|Pre-conference {{tutorials}} {{have played}} an important role in ISMB since the first conference.

5|$|The giraffe {{has also}} been used for some {{scientific}} experiments and discoveries.

5|$|Pixar got {{its start}} in 1974 when New York Institute of Technology's (NYIT) founder Alexander Schure, who was also {{the owner of a}} {{traditional}} animation studio, established the Computer Graphics Lab (CGL), recruited <b>computer</b> <b>scientists</b> who shared his ambitions about creating the world's first computer-animated film. Edwin Catmull and Malcolm Blanchard were the first to be hired and were soon joined by Alvy Ray Smith and David DiFrancesco some months later, which were the four original members of the Computer Graphics Lab. Schure kept pouring money into the computer graphics lab, an estimated $15million, giving the group everything they desired and driving NYIT into serious financial troubles. Eventually, the group realized they needed to work in a real film studio in order to reach their goal, and when George Lucas approached them and offered them a job at his studio, six employees decided to move over to Lucasfilm. During the following months, they gradually resigned from CGL, found temporary jobs for about a year to avoid making Schure suspicious, before they joined The Graphics Group at Lucasfilm.|$|E
