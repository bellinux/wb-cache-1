5|$|The {{combined}} SDU {{and ground}} station bias was calculated from 17 signals exchanged between the ground {{station and the}} aircraft during a 30-minute period before take-off, when the aircraft's location was known (at Kuala Lumpur International Airport). To establish the accuracy of their calculations, the bias value was {{used to calculate the}} distance from the aircraft to the satellite during the time it was on the ground at KLIA, with errors of <1 km-8.85 km (<1 mi-5.5 mi). The distance from the satellite to the aircraft was also calculated while the aircraft was in-flight and at a known location shortly after take-off, showing similar accuracy. The distance between the satellite and aircraft could thus be calculated for signals exchanged between 02:25–08:19, after Flight 370 disappeared from radar. However, this could only produce a ring on Earth's surface that is equidistant from the satellite at the <b>calculated</b> <b>value,</b> adjusted to account for the aircraft flying at 10,000 m (33,000 ft). The ring could also be reduced to an arc by taking into consideration the maximum range of the aircraft if it flew at its maximum speed.|$|E

5|$|The {{software}} also {{calculated the}} fireball's instantaneous apparent magnitude at the ground. The computation started {{and ended with}} heights of approximately 250km, long {{before and after the}} cameras of the European Fireball Network could observe it. Its apparent magnitude started at a value of +5.7 and it became brighter quite quickly. The program gave an apparent magnitude of −5.7 when it was seen by one camera and −6.3 at perigee. The fireball subsequently dimmed, with an apparent magnitude of −5.4 when it was last seen by the cameras and a final <b>calculated</b> <b>value</b> of +6.0 at a height of 257km. These values are not entirely certain, because the program worked with the simplified assumption that the luminous efficacy of the fireball did not change along the track. The starting apparent magnitude is not far from the naked eye visibility limits. For example, faint stars of the magnitude +6 can be observed only in dark rural areas approximately 150km away from large cities. This magnitude corresponds to the apparent magnitude of Uranus. At its brightest, it was several times as bright as the maximum brightness of Venus.|$|E

As of the end of the 2016 season, Texas' all-time record is 891–359–33 (.718), which ranks as the second-most wins in NCAA Division I FBS history. Texas is known for their post-season appearances, ranking second in number of bowl game appearances (53), fourth in bowl game victories (27), most Southwest Conference football championships (27), and most Cotton Bowl Classic appearances and victories. [...] Other NCAA records include 108 winning seasons out of 122 total seasons, 23 seasons with 10 or more wins, 9 undefeated seasons, and 26 seasons with at most one loss or tie.
