40|$|Studies of the {{fundamental}} processes of combustion are usually concerned with wide ranges of investigation of individual processes. In general, each fundamental combustion process may be studied {{in an environment that}} is most suited to its evaluation and possibly unrelated basically to any practical application. The majority of the data presented in volume I of this series concern {{the fundamental}} aspects of combustion as functions of the individual occurrence of various contributing processes. In a jet engine, however, the various fundamental combustion processes may occur simultaneously and may interact. Furthermore, the engine environment usually does not permit independent variation of single combustion parameters, since specified operating conditions impose specific values on the parameters. In volume II, data are presented to show the effect of operating conditions on the over-all combustion process in different <b>combustion</b> <b>components.</b> To show the effect of operating conditions, it is necessary to specify the range of these conditions within which <b>combustion</b> <b>components</b> may operate. Therefore, this chapter presents only the operating conditions that might be required in the primary combustors and afterburners of typical current turbojet engines. (Corresponding information on ram-jet engines is presented in ch. xisi.) This chapter is not intended to serve as an explanation of engine operation. The operating conditions of the <b>combustion</b> <b>components</b> are presented in terms of total pressures and temperatures at the primary-combustor and afterburner inlets, reference velocities and outlet total temperatures of the primary combustors, and velocities at the plane of the flameholder in the afterburners.

This article describes experimental investigations aimed at providing such a fundamental basis for design and engineering of <b>combustion</b> <b>components.</b> It reports recent applications of imaging techniques to cryogenic combustion at high pressure.

40|$|Methoxyphenols, lignin {{pyrolysis}} products, {{are major}} biomass <b>combustion</b> <b>components</b> and are considered potential tracers for wood smoke emissions. Their atmospheric reactivity, however, {{has not been}} well characterized. Guaiacol, creosol, and syringol are three typical methoxyphenols generated in relatively high concentrations in fresh wood smoke. In this study, the gas-phase reactions of NO 3 radicals with these methoxyphenols were investigated using a laboratory-built vacuum ultraviolet photoionization gas time-of-flight mass spectrometer (VUV-GTOFMS) and off-line GC-MS. By combining experimental and theoretical methods, 4 -nitroguaiacol, 6 -nitroguaiacol, and 4, 6 -dinitroguaiacol were determined as the primary degradation products for guaiacol; similarly, 6 -nitrocreosol and 3 -nitrosyringol were identified for creosol and syringol, respectively. Using the relative rate method, rate constants at 298 K and 1 atm for the gas-phase reactions of guaiacol, creosol, and syringol with NO 3 radicals were measured to be 3. 2 x 10 (- 12), 2. 4 x 10 (- 13), and 4. 0 x 10 (- 13) cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1), respectively. At a typical tropospheric concentration of NO 3 radicals (5 x 10 (8) molecule cm(- 3)), atmospheric lifetimes for guaiacol, creosol, and syringol toward NO 3 radicals were 0. 2, 2. 3, and 1. 4 h, respectively.

40|$|A {{significant}} number of domestic and industrial boilers are in operation in Ukraine. Nitrogen oxides are the most dangerous among all combustion products that pollute the atmosphere, therefore, one should take some measures for decreasing the formation of nitrogen oxides during combustion. The {{studies were carried out}} at the boilers of low power (100 kW) with a tubular radiator and an open end. The studies in the furnaces of industrial steam boilers having a tubular radiator with a closed end have not been done. The numerical study results of the gaseous fuel combustion processes in the furnace of a DE- 10 / 14 steam water-tube boiler are presented. The fuel-air mixture is formed by premixing the 15 % part of the air with a primary burner twist factor n= 2. 4 and a secondary burner twist factor n= 1. 6, and an air excess factor αв= 10. As a result of the studies, the temperature and velocity distributions of gases in the combustion chamber, the density of heat flows on the screen tubular surfaces, and the concentrations of the <b>combustion</b> <b>components</b> were determined. Flue gas recirculation in the volume of 80 - 100 % is provided, and the reversible movement of combustion products towards the combustion front provides a reduction in the concentration of nitrogen oxides up to 123 - 125 mg/m 3 at the furnace outlet.

40|$|The {{increasing}} material {{temperatures of}} gas turbine components have the consequences that ceramic materials are taken {{more and more}} into account as construction materials. Typical components are turbine blades, nozzles, inlet liners, heat exchangers or <b>combustion</b> <b>components.</b> For their design the material data at operating temperatures have to be known. The most important data are strength, tensile creep and fatigue strength, and the gas corrosion behaviour, which are presented here for a sintered silicon carbide and for temperatures up to 1550 deg C. With slightly modified commercial water cooled hydraulic grips for tension-compression loading a maximum specimen temperature of 1550 deg C could be reached. The development of grips with hot elements have reduced the temperature gradient between the clamping and testing areas of the specimen. With this system specimen temperatures up to 1600 deg C can be reached over a measuring length of 25 mm. Due to the reduced thermal gradient also sh orter specimens can be used. The tensile creep experiments with the silicon carbide tested here show, that a maximum operating temperature for long term applications is limited to about 1500 deg C. Significant creep deformation at 20 OMPa occurs above 1500 deg C. The minimum creep rate can be described by a power law, and the activation energy by an exponential law as far as corrosion can be neglected. After cyclic tension-compression loading at 1 Hz over 100 hrs slightly reduced strength values are detected. The fractographic investigations of the specimens {{have shown that the}} strength degradation is more a result of gas corrosion than a result of microstructural fatigue at temperatures >= 1 550 deg C...|$|E

It contains the <b>combustion</b> <b>components</b> of a 1 MWe coal fired power plant, a 17, 500 lb/hour steam boiler, coal storage and feed components, and stack gas cleanup components. The plant s design incorporates improvements resulting from 2000 hours of testing between 1987 and 1993 on a first generation, commercial scale, air cooled combustor of equal thermal rating. Since operations began in early 1996, a total of 51 days of testing have been successfully completed. Major results include durability of the combustor s refractory wall, excellent combustion with high ash concentration in the fuel, removal of 95 % to 100 % of the slag in the combustor, very little ash deposition in the boiler, major reduction of in-plant parasitic power, and simplified power system control {{through the use of}} modular designs of sub-systems and computer control. Rapid fuel switching between oil, gas, and coal and turndown of up to a factor of three was accomplished. All these features have been incorporated in advanced coal fired plant designs in the 1 to 20 MWe range. Incremental capital costs are only $ 100 to $ 200 /kW higher than comparable rated gas or oil fired steam generating systems. Most of its components and subsystems can be factory assembled for very rapid field installation.
