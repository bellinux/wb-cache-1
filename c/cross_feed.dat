The two dominant phyla in healthy humans are Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, with minor phyla such as Proteobacteria having elevated abundances in various disease states. While the gut microbiome has been widely studied, relatively {{little is known about}} the role of interspecies interactions in promoting microbiome stability and function. We developed a biofilm metabolic model of a very simple gut microbiome community consisting of a representative bacteroidete (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron), firmicute (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) and proteobacterium (Escherichia coli) to investigate the putative role of metabolic byproduct <b>cross</b> <b>feeding</b> between species on community stability, robustness and flexibility. The model predicted coexistence of the three species only if four essential cross-feeding relationships were present. We found that <b>cross</b> <b>feeding</b> allowed coexistence to be robustly maintained for large variations in biofilm thickness and nutrient levels. However, the model predicted that community composition and short chain fatty acid levels could be strongly affected only over small ranges of byproduct uptake rates, indicating a possible lack of flexibility in our cross-feeding mechanism.

50|$|Two {{or three}} similar stages are stacked {{side by side}} and burn in parallel. Using crossfeed, the fuel tanks of the orbital stage are kept full, while the tank(s) in the booster stage(s) are used to run engines in the booster stage(s) and orbital stage.

40|$|This is {{the final}} report in a study {{examining}} the impact of launch vehicles for various boost propulsion design options. These options included: differing boost phase engines using different combinations of fuels and coolants to include RP- 1, methane, propane (subcooled and normal boiling point), and hydrogen; variable and high mixture ratio hydrogen engines; translating nozzles on boost phase engines; and <b>cross</b> <b>feeding</b> propellants from the booster to second stage. Vehicles examined included a fully reusable two stage cargo vehicle and a single stage to orbit vehicle. The use of subcooled propane as a fuel generated vehicles with the lowest total vehicle dry mass.

The use of high mixture ratio or variable mixture ratio hydrogen engines in the boost phase of flight resulted in vehicles with total dry mass 20 percent greater than the reference hydrogen vehicle. Translating nozzles for boost phase engines generated a heavier vehicle. Also examined were the design impacts on the vehicle and ground support subsystems when subcooled propane {{is used as a}} fuel. The most significant cost difference between facilities to handle normal boiling point versus subcooled propane is 5 million dollars. Vehicle cost differences were negligible.

Accordingly, E. coli glucose transport mutants that produce lower amounts of acidic metabolites had little effect on the survival of V. cholerae in cocultures.

Segregants from an unstable Ncd population gave rise to two viable haploid cell types. By contrast, stable Ncds segregated into a population of viable and inviable haploid cells. We propose that the latter are derived from irreversible chromosome silencing. Our results indicate that clonal populations of stable Ncds are heterogenous and suggest that segregation and inactivation are independent parameters...|$|R

40|$|A {{stability}} and control augmentation system (SCAS) was designed {{based on a}} set of comprehensive performance criteria. Linear optimal control theory was applied to determine appropriate feedback gains for the stability augmentation system (SAS).

The ratio of these factors was employed as a parameter for SAS analysis and values of the feedback gains were selected on this basis to satisfy three of the performance criteria for full and partial state feedback systems. A least squares design method was then applied to determine control augmentation system (CAS) <b>cross</b> <b>feed</b> gains to satisfy the remaining seven performance criteria.

40|$|Stable mutants highly {{resistant}} to the protein synthesis inhibitor diphtheria toxin (dipr) have been selected in human diploid fibroblast cells at a frequency of 1 - 8 X 10 (- 6). Treatment of cells with mutagens, (e. g., ethylmethanesulfonate, nitrosoguanidine, and ICR- 170), increased the frequencies of dipr mutants by 50 - to 500 -fold in different experiments, and the optimal expression time for dipr mutation was about 5 days.

40|$|Abstract Displacements {{obtained}} from double integration of digitally recorded ground accelerations often show drifts {{much larger than}} those expected for the true ground displacements. These drifts {{might be due to}} many things, including dynamic elastic ground tilt, inelastic ground deformation, hysteresis in the instruments, and <b>cross</b> <b>feed</b> due to misalignment of nominally orthogonal sensors. This article shows that even if those effects were not present, the analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) process can produce apparent “pulses ” and offsets in the acceleration baseline if the ground motion is slowly varying compared with the quantization level of the digitization. Such slowly varying signals can be produced by constant offsets that do not coincide with a quantization level and by near- and intermediate-field terms in the wave field radiated from earthquakes. Double integration of these apparent pulses and offsets leads to drifts in the displacements similar to those found in processing real recordings. These effects decrease in importance as the resolution of the ADC process increases...|$|E

The dynamic equations are then developed for the tip-path plane, {{and the influence of}} individual and combined variations in the design parameters determined. The steady state flapping response is examined with respect to control input and aircraft angular rate which leads to a feedforward control law for control decoupling through <b>cross</b> <b>feed,</b> and a feedback control law to decouple the steady state flapping response. The condition for achieving perfect decoupling of the flapping response due to aircraft pitch and roll rates without using feedback control is also found for the hover case.

40|$|Bacteria of {{the marine}} Roseobacter clade are characterised by their ability to utilise {{a wide range of}} organic and {{inorganic}} compounds to support growth. Trimethylamine (TMA) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) are methylated amines (MA) and form part of the dissolved organic nitrogen pool, the second largest source of nitrogen after N 2 gas, in the oceans. We investigated if the marine heterotrophic bacterium, Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS- 3, could utilise TMA and TMAO as a supplementary energy source and whether this trait had any beneficial effect on growth. In R. pomeroyi, catabolism of TMA and TMAO resulted in the production of intracellular ATP which in turn helped to enhance growth rate and growth yield as well as enhancing cell survival during prolonged energy starvation. Furthermore, the simultaneous use of two different exogenous energy sources led to a greater enhancement of chemoorganoheterotrophic growth. The use of TMA and TMAO primarily as an energy source resulted in the remineralisation of nitrogen in the form of ammonium, which could <b>cross</b> <b>feed</b> into another bacterium.

However, the genetic traits facilitating their adaptation to this highly competitive and variable ecological niche are still poorly characterized.

Such glycan-degrading abilities are expected to be a reflection of the carbon sources present in the ecological niche of bifidobacteria. Furthermore, transcriptome profiling of bifidobacterial genomes supported the involvement of various chromosomal loci in glycan metabolism. The widespread occurrence of bifidobacterial saccharolytic features was confirmed by interrogating metagenomic datasets, thereby supporting the notion that metabolic accessibility to dietary and/or host derived glycans is a potent evolutionary force that has shaped bifidobacterial genomes.
