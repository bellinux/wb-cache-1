500|$|Another {{distance}} measure {{commonly used}} in agglomerative clustering is {{the distance between the}} centroids of pairs of clusters, also known as the weighted group method. It can be calculated easily in constant time per distance calculation. However, it is not reducible. For instance, if the input forms the set of three points of an equilateral triangle, merging two of these points into a larger cluster causes the inter-cluster distance to decrease, a violation of reducibility. Therefore, the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm will not necessarily find the same clustering as the greedy algorithm.

50|$|The {{second major}} {{improvement}} is increased azimuth accuracy. With PSRs and old SSRs, azimuth {{of the aircraft}} {{is determined by the}} half split (<b>centroid)</b> <b>method.</b> The half split method is computed by recording the azimuth of the first and last replies from the aircraft, as the radar beam sweeps past its position. Then the midpoint between the start and stop azimuth is used for aircraft position. With MSSR (monopulse secondary surveillance radar) and Mode S, the radar can use the information of one reply to determine azimuth. This is calculated based on the RF phase of the aircraft reply, as determined by the sum and difference antenna elements, and is called monopulse. This monopulse method results in superior azimuth resolution, and removes target jitter from the display.|$|E
50|$|The output fuzzy {{sets for}} all the rules are then {{aggregated}} into a single fuzzy set. This group encompasses a range of output values, and is de-fuzzified in order to resolve a single crisp output value from the group (i.e. a value between 0 and 1). This approach uses the <b>centroid</b> <b>method</b> to obtain the representative non-fuzzy value for the output, as commonly adopted in the Sugeno-type systems. The expert reasoning runs as follows: if all input variables are F, {{the value of the}} module is 0 (good response according to all metrics used); if all indices are U, the value of the module is 1 (bad response according to all inputs used), while all the other combinations assume intermediate values. Limits F and U may come from experience, may be extracted from literature, or may be set by law. The weights can be chosen based on the analyst own experience in handling each input.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Gene {{expression}} based cancer classification using classifier ensembles is {{the main}} focus of this work. A new ensemble method is proposed that combines predictions of a small number of k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers with majority vote. Diversity of predictions is guaranteed by assigning a separate feature subset, randomly sampled from the original set of features, to each classifier. Accuracy of k-NNs is ensured by the statistically confirmed dependence between dataset complexity, determining how difficult is a dataset for classification, and classification error. Experiments carried out on three gene expression datasets containing different types of cancer show that our ensemble method is superior to 1) a single best classifier in the ensemble, 2) the nearest shrunken <b>centroids</b> <b>method</b> originally proposed for gene expression data, and 3) the traditional ensemble construction scheme that {{does not take into account}} dataset complexity.

We {{generate}} two sets of simulations to test our method. The first set is generated by GalSim with elliptical Moffat profile and strong anisotropy which shifts {{the center of the}} PSF. The second set of simulation is drawn from CFHT i band stellar imaging data. We find non-negligible anisotropy from CFHT stellar images, which leads to ∼ 0. 08 scatter in unit of pixels using polynomial fitting method Vakili and Hogg (2016). And we apply FPF method to estimate the centroid in real space, this scatter reduces to ∼ 0. 04 in SNR= 200 CFHT like sample. In low SNR (50 and 100) CFHT like samples, the background noise dominates the shifting of the centroid, therefore the scatter estimated from different methods are similar. We compare polynomial fitting and FPF using GalSim simulation with optical anisotropy. We find that in all SNR∼ 50, 100 and 200) samples, FPF performs better than polynomial fitting by a factor of ∼ 3. In general, we suggest that in real observations there are anisotropy which shift the <b>centroid,</b> and FPF <b>method</b> is a better way to accurately locate it.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel technique—Floating <b>Centroids</b> <b>Method</b> (FCM) {{designed to improve}} {{the performance of a}} conventional neural network classifier. Partition space is a space that is used to categorize data sample after sample is mapped by neural network. In the partition space, the centroid is a point, which denotes the center of a class. In a conventional neural network classifier, position of centroids and the relationship between centroids and classes are set manually. In addition, number of centroids is fixed with reference to the number of classes. The proposed approach introduces many floating centroids, which are spread throughout the partition space and obtained by using K-Means algorithm. Moreover, different classes labels are attached to these centroids automatically. A sample is predicted as a certain class if the closest centroid of its corresponding mapped point is labeled by this class. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method has favorable performance especially with respect to the training accuracy, generalization accuracy, and average F-measures.
