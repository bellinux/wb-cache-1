40|$|Abstract — Recently, {{with the}} {{emergence}} of mobile technology and mobile banking, debit and <b>credit</b> <b>transactions</b> have been the most common transactions that are widely spreading, using such technologies. In this research, we specify the concurrent debit and <b>credit</b> <b>transactions</b> in temporal logics such as CTL (Computational Tree Logic) and LTL (Linear-Time Temporal Logic). These specifications describe the infinite histories that may be produced by the iterations of such concurrent transactions infinitely many times. We represent the infinite histories as a model of temporal logics formulae. Then, model checkers, such as NuSMV or SPIN, can carry out exhaustive checks of the correctness of the concurrent debit and <b>credit</b> <b>transactions.</b> Moreover, in this paper, we presume that the serializability condition is too strict. Therefore, a relaxed condition has been suggested to keep the database consistent. Moreover, the relaxed condition is easier to encode into temporal logics formulae...|$|R

50|$|Leases of movable goods—that is, not land or housing—would include, for example, a telefax {{machine or}} a motor car, with rent being paid in instalments, {{together}} with fees and interest. (If interest and fees are not charged, {{it will not}} be a <b>credit</b> <b>transaction</b> in terms of the Act). The total instalments will usually amount to the value of the item let. Once all instalments are paid, ownership passes to the consumer. This is contrary to the common law of lease. If, however, the agreement provides that ownership will always remain with the lessor, it will still be a <b>credit</b> <b>transaction</b> in terms of the Act.|$|E

40|$|Agricultural {{production}} takes time. The lag {{between the}} start of production and the realization of output ranges from {{a few months to}} several years. In this environment, <b>credit</b> <b>transactions</b> serve to finance production and to permit farmers to consume before harvest. Moreover, the agricultural production process depends on a host of external factors, many of which are not {{under the control of the}} farmer. When production is risky and insurance markets are incomplete, <b>credit</b> <b>transactions</b> serve a valuable role by permitting people to smooth consumption in the face of a randomly fluctuating stream of income. Where farmers are poorer, these motivations for <b>credit</b> <b>transactions</b> are stronger- liquidity constraints are more likely to be binding so that production and consumption cannot be financed from savings, and the costs (in terms of utility, health, and even survival) of fluctuations in an already low level of consumption are very high. Seasonal <b>credit</b> <b>transactions,</b> therefore, are found in virtually all poor agricultural economies. The institutional arrangements through which these transactions are effected are varied and often complex. There are formal financial institutions, including banks, credit cooperatives, and group lending schemes. Many financial transactions, however, occur outside the boundaries of the formal financial system. There are specialist moneylenders, informal loans among family and friends, loans tied to purchases, labor transactions, or land rental arrangements, and a variety of informal financial groups. It is commonly the case in rural areas of poor countrie...|$|R
