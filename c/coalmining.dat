In the paper, order degree evaluation index system of <b>coalmine</b> safety and economy has been established and by SPSS software coordination degree of <b>coalmine</b> safety and economy level has been calculated quantitatively.

40|$|AbstractCoal is {{the primary}} energy {{resource}} in China, with the raw coal production reaching 2. 8 billion tons in 2008. However, great amount of <b>coalmine</b> methane is released during coal exploitation, which runs up to over 3. 5 billion cubic meters. To minimize environmental pollution caused by <b>coalmine</b> methane and to promote resource utilization, various systems for utilizing <b>coalmine</b> methane energy are developed in China. Common types of such systems include power generation system utilizing <b>coalmine</b> methane, combined-heat-and-power system of <b>coalmine</b> methane, thermal energy provision system of <b>coalmine</b> methane, and fuel-gas provision system, etc. This paper describes elements, characteristics, and applicability of these systems and presents thermal economy analysis to specific system. Thermal economic indexes, such as exergic efficiency and exergic losses of specific <b>coalmine</b> methane energy utilization system are obtained. These data are very useful in finding the way to make further progress in improving thermal economy of <b>coalmine</b> methane energy utilization systems {{as well as providing}} technical support to make tradeoffs among those systems. In addition, the possibility of serving <b>coalmine</b> methane energy utilization systems as distributed energy resource is discussed and potential problems summarized.

Aluminium smelting requires large amounts of electricity, and the original plan had been to use locally produced electricity, generated with local coal supplies.
