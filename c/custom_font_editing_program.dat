5000|$|King's {{modifications}} to Adobe's fonts were mechanical {{and did not}} eliminate copyright infringement. Since the <b>font</b> <b>editing</b> <b>programs</b> extracted control points from Adobe's fonts, use of those programs constituted copying of literal expression. Thus, King also infringed on Adobe's copyright through intermediate copying into RAM.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2010, Fontographer version 5.0 was {{released}} by FontLab. [...] This represents the first major features added to the product since 1996.

50|$|Paul King, {{the sole}} {{employee}} of Southern Software, Inc. altered Adobe's Utopia Font using the commercially available tools FontMonger and Fontographer. He produced three new fonts which differed trivially {{from the original}} <b>font.</b> These <b>font</b> <b>editing</b> <b>programs</b> extracted the control points from Adobe's font files and made them available for manipulation and saving to a new font file. He had scaled the coordinates of the fonts by 101% on the vertical axis in order to slightly change the fonts. Adobe also alleged that King modified the <b>font</b> <b>editing</b> tools in order to remove Adobe's copyright notices. In total, King was accused of infringing Adobe's copyrights on more than 1100 fonts.|$|R
