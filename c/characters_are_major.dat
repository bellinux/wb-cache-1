The exact origin of Jack Frost remains unclear with suspicions of Norse and Ango-Saxon history. Jack is mentioned in holiday song “The Christmas Song” and has a presence among movies and wintertime specials including movies ‘’Jack Frost” and “Rise of the Guardians” and television series “A Touch of Frost”. <b>Characters</b> <b>are</b> <b>major</b> components in contemporary children’s books, television shows, songs, movies, and oral tradition.|$|E
40|$|Visually and phonologically similar <b>characters</b> <b>are</b> <b>major</b> {{contributing}} factors for errors in Chinese text. By defining appropriate similarity measures that consider extended Cangjie codes, {{we can identify}} visually similar characters within {{a fraction of a}} second. Relying on the pronunciation information noted for individual characters in Chinese lexicons, we can compute a list of characters that are phonologically similar to a given character. We collected 621 incorrect Chinese words reported on the Internet, and analyzed the causes of these errors. 83 % of these errors were related to phonological similarity, and 48 % of them were related to visual similarity between the involved characters. Generating the lists of phonologically and visually similar characters, our programs were able to contain more than 90 % of the incorrect characters in the reported errors. ...|$|E

The {{brothers were}} limited to one-way communication with the player, and at any point a player could choose to walk away and [...] "break the spell" [...] of the game. Displaying video in the game was initially infeasible. Designing around the limits, the designers created the trap books, which were location-specific, one-way communication devices.

5000|$|It is {{commonly}} mistaken that Here and Now is a spin-off of The Cosby Show. That {{is not the}} case, {{due to the fact}} Malcolm-Jamal Warner played an entirely different <b>character.</b> This discrepancy <b>is</b> due to the many similarities between the A.J. character and Theo Huxtable, the character that Malcolm-Jamal Warner played on The Cosby Show. Some of similarities <b>were</b> that both <b>characters</b> <b>were</b> psychology <b>majors</b> and worked at community centers (Theo worked at a community center during The Cosby Shows final season).

40|$|Rendering {{detailed}} animated <b>characters</b> <b>is</b> a <b>major</b> {{limiting factor}} in crowd simulation. In this paper {{we present a}} new representation for 3 D animated characters which supports output-sensitive rendering. Each <b>character</b> <b>is</b> encoded through a small collection of textured boxes storing color and depth values. At runtime, each box is animated according to the rigid transformation of its associated bone. A fragment shader is used to recover the original geometry using an adapted version of relief mapping. Unlike competing outputsensitive approaches, our compact representation is able to recover high-frequency surface details and reproduces view-motion parallax. Furthermore, our approach does not require us to predefine the animation sequences nor to select a subset of discrete views. Our user study demonstrates that our approach allows for much more simulated agents with negligible visual artifacts. Postprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Oral mucosal lesions of ulcerative, desquamative, and bullous <b>character</b> <b>are</b> <b>major</b> {{problems}} for clinicians and patients alike. Underlying such processes is the autoimmune reaction manifesting as specific subsets of immunopathology. Responsible {{for the maintenance}} of mucosal integrity within the oral cavity are numerous adhesion proteins which operate at the cell-to-cell and cell-to-connective-tissue-matrix level. Two of the better-understood conditions characterized by altered or disordered levels of adherence are the pemphigus and the pemphigoid groups of lesions. Autoantibodies in pemphigus vulgaris specifically attack normal proteins within the desmosomal structure. Cellular adhesion is affected by steric interference by antibodies directed against antigens residing within the intercellular space or the desmosome itself. Such alterations ultimately result in cell-to-cell separation, with production of the acantholytic element characteristic of pemphigus vulgaris. Mucous membrane pemphigoid is characterized by a separation at the junction of the epithelium and connective tissue {{at the level of the}} basement membrane complex. Histologically, a split occurs in the sub-basilar region, with antibodies directed to the 230 -kDa protein component of the hemidesmosome. Minor antigens residing within the basement membrane area include a 180 -kDa element as well as other less commonly found proteins near the membrane complex. Manifestations of these illnesses are often severe. Management strategies of pemphigus vulgaris have changed over the recent past, with new modalities supplementing the traditional corticosteroid approach. Both conditions are usually lifelong, with the implications of management a major consideration...|$|R
