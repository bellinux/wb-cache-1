5000|$|In 1928 she {{designed}} three chairs from Corbusier's {{principles that}} {{the chair was}} a [...] "machine for siting," [...] and {{that each of the}} three would accommodate different positions for different tasks. At Corbuiser's request a chair was made for conversation: the B301 sling back chair, another for relaxation: the LC2 Grand Comfort chair, and the last for sleeping: the B306 chaise longue. Each chair had a <b>chromium-plated</b> tubular <b>steel</b> base.|$|R
5000|$|Gray's {{innovative}} Bibendum Chair {{was one of}} the 20th century's most recognisable furniture designs. Its back/arm rest {{consists of}} two semi-circular, padded tubes encased in soft leather. The name that Gray chose for the chair, originates from the Bibendum character created by Michelin to advertise tyres. [...] The Bibendum Chair was relatively large; its depth approximately 840mm and its height 740 mm tall. The visible part of the frame of the Bibendum was made of a polished, <b>chromium-plated,</b> stainless <b>steel</b> tube. The framing of the actual seat was made of beechwood, and there was rubber webbing that was inter-woven across the base of the seat to provide added comfort. The seat, back and arm rests encased in soft, pale leather.|$|R
50|$|The building’s main {{elements}} were large bands of Portland stone alternating with strips of windows spanning {{the whole building}} width, a glass wall that stretched {{the height of the}} building at 90 feet that lit each open-plan floor with natural light (from a side lightwell due to the densely built up area), against which the enormous Travertine marble staircase spiralled up the centre of the building, and the distinctive non-reflecting concave windows along the street level at front and back - the first in the country at the time. The design is distinctly modern in comparison to the regular architectural style of the time - Simpson wanted the building elements to visually show their function rather than disguised by unnecessary decoration; innovative in its use of materials - large windows, <b>chromium-plated</b> fittings, <b>steel</b> structure (devised by Felix Samuely, which London County Council first had the steel framing removed before agreeing to allow its use); and cost such a price that Alexander Simpson warned that the company wasn’t expecting to earn a profit for several years after due to his determination for creating something of such high quality (which it later won awards for).|$|R

5000|$|Usually each segment in this chain (which is {{constructed}} from riveted metal sections {{similar to a}} bicycle chain, but without rollers) features small sharp cutting teeth. Each tooth {{takes the form of}} a folded tab of <b>chromium-plated</b> <b>steel</b> with a sharp angular or curved corner and two cutting edges, one on the top plate and one on the side plate. Left-handed and right-handed teeth are alternated in the chain. Chains come in varying pitch and gauge; the pitch of a chain is defined as half of the length spanned by any three consecutive rivets (e.g., 8 mm, 0.325 inch), while the gauge is the thickness of the drive link where it fits into the guide bar (e.g., 1.5 mm, 0.05 inch). Conventional [...] "full complement" [...] chain has one tooth for every two drive links. [...] "Full skip" [...] chain has one tooth for every three drive links. Built into each tooth is a depth gauge or [...] "raker" [...] which rides ahead of the tooth and limits the depth of cut, typically to around 0.5 mm (0.025"). Depth gauges are critical to safe chain operation. If left too high they will cause very slow cutting, if filed too low the chain will become more prone to kick back. Low depth gauges will also cause the saw to vibrate excessively. Vibration is not only uncomfortable for the operator but is also detrimental to the saw.|$|E
5000|$|PD1/3: In Autumn 1946, the Construction and Use {{regulations}} were revised, allowing a maximum width for buses of 8', {{rather than the}} previous 7'6" [...] inches, provided the Traffic Commissioners approved the use of wider buses on routes, {{in the same way}} as they already had the power to approve double-deck buses on a route-by-route basis. Also, the gross vehicle weight for a double-deck bus was increased to 12 tons, from the wartime figure of 11 tons. The PD1/3 differed from the PD1 in that it had wider axles, being designed for the 8-foot width. Oldham Corporation quickly obtained clearance for all their routes and in 1947 DBU244 with Charles H. Roe H31/25R body became the first 8-foot-wide motorbus built for service in the UK. Oldham took in total 50 similar buses in 1947/8. Manchester Corporation were also early customers for the wider bus, following up their initial 1946 batch of fifty PD1s with a 1947/8 order for 100 PD1/3 with 58-seat (H32/26R) bodies to their standard outline by Metro-Cammell. During 1948 Ribble Motor Services, who had obtained permission to use full-width double-deck coaches on their express services from East Lancashire to Blackpool, received 30 such bodies by H. V. Burlingham of Blackpool, which had full-width cabs, electrically powered folding doors to the rear platform, which itself was built-up to saloon level, allowing a small luggage boot. The body design, with additional luggage stowage over the rear wheel arches, had generously radiussed windows, two sunroofs on the upper deck and, although of lowbridge layout (the Leyland patent on this expired in 1937), were fitted out to full coach standards for 49 passengers (FCL27/22RD). Liberal use was made of <b>chromium-plated</b> <b>steel</b> trim and they carried the cream coach livery, with red relief, rather than the bus livery of red with cream relief, they soon became famous as the [...] "White Ladies" [...] was so successful that a further twenty similar vehicles on PD2/3 chassis with East Lancashire Coachbuilders bodies, were added in 1951.|$|E
40|$|General Design Criterion 26 {{requires}} {{that one of}} the reactivity control systems shall use control rods, preferably including a positive means for inserting the rods, and shall be capable of reliably controlling reactivity changes to assure that fuel design limits are not exceeded under conditions of normal operation, including anticipated operational occurrences. The areas listed below relating to materials considerations {{in the design of the}} control rod drive mechanism are reviewed. The review areas are similar to those given in Standard Review Plan Section 5. 2. 3, "Reactor Coolant Pressure Boundary Materials. " For the purpose of this SRP section, the control rod system is comprised of the control rod drive mechanism (CRDM) and extends only to the coupling interface with the reactivity control (poison) elements in the reactor vessel; it does not include the electrical and hydraulic systems necessary for actuating the CRDOs. 1. Materials Specifications The properties of the materials used in the control rod drive are reviewed from the standpoint of adequate performance throughout the design life of the plant (or component). Materials commonly used include austentic stainless steels (which may be cold worked) <b>chromium-plated</b> stainless <b>steels,</b> martensi-tic stainless steels, precipitation-hardening stainless steels such as 17 - 4 PH, and other special-purpose materials such as cobalt-base alloys (Stellites) ...|$|R

Depending on operating temperatures of pyrolytic chromium-plating process {{on the surface}} of steel specimens chromium coatings with homogeneous, horizontal-layered and columnar (dendritic) structures were formed. The speed of formation chromium coatings during pyrolytic chromium-plating process was 5 μm/min – 6 μm/min. The microhardness of formed chromium coatings was 10000 MPa – 20000 MPa. Rotating bending fatigue test results have shown that after pyrolytic chromium-plating the {{fatigue strength}} of steel can be improved as well as considerably worsened. It was determined, that chromium coatings having three different microstructures had different resistant to cyclic load.

40|$|A {{series of}} layered {{structures}} based on epoxy resins coated with diamond-like carbon (DLC) are examined as potential replacements for electroplated chromium in aerospace applications. Diamond-like carbon coatings can offer superior mechanical properties and tribological performance; however, in some applications high internal stresses and poor adhesion limit their practical use. A DLC/epoxy system is developed and studied utilising pin-on-disk testing, {{scanning electron microscopy}} and atomic force microscopy, resulting in an optimum system with characteristics superior to those of <b>chromium-plated</b> <b>steel.</b> This new coating system has a great potential in restoring worn or damaged aircraft components, without the health and environmental issues associated with chromium plating.
