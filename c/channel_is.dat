5|$|At one point, Eddy Creek {{flows through}} a {{restored}} channel at a reclaimed mining site. Further downstream, the creek flows through its natural channel and cuts across {{a number of}} rock ledges. However, {{by the time it}} crosses US Route 6, it has lost its flow. Nevertheless, its <b>channel</b> <b>is</b> still discernible and its gradient is shallower. The creek loses its channel completely at the intersection of an electric transmission corridor and the Eddy Creek Mine Tunnel. It eventually reappears, but disappears again in strip pits and sinks. From Birds Eye Mine to Underwood Road, the stream channel has been completely destroyed. The creek has an engineered channel in one reach where it passes through a residential area.|$|E
5|$|Broad <b>Channel</b> <b>is</b> a {{small island}} with fewer than 3,000 residents, and as a result, it has {{historically}} {{been one of the}} least-used stations in the system. In 1985, the station had only 224 paying daily riders on a typical weekday not counting farebeaters (people not paying their fare) {{making it one of the}} least used stations in the system. The station has the second-lowest ridership in the subway system as of 2015, with 91,766 annual riders, or 310 riders per weekday. In terms of annual ridership, it was only trailed by Cortlandt Street, a station that is closed to be rebuilt as a result of damage from the September 11 attacks. Overall, Broad <b>Channel</b> <b>is</b> the least used of any fully operating subway station in the city, although on weekdays it has on average 5 more riders than the Beach 105th Street station. However, it is the only transfer point between the A train and the Rockaway Park Shuttle, and some 2,700 daily riders use it in this capacity. As a result, the platforms are sometimes packed.|$|E

5|$|Directional {{anisotropy}} {{refers to}} a difference in diffusion mechanism or rate in a particular direction on a given crystallographic plane. These differences may {{be a result of}} either anisotropy in the surface lattice (e.g. a rectangular lattice) or the presence of steps on a surface. One of the more dramatic examples of directional anisotropy is the diffusion of adatoms on channeled surfaces such as fcc (110), where diffusion along the <b>channel</b> <b>is</b> much faster than diffusion across the channel.|$|E
5|$|For {{greatest}} {{efficiency and}} best coupling to the room's air volume, subwoofers {{can be placed}} {{in a corner of the}} room, far from large room openings, and closer to the listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long wavelength; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener's left and right ears, and so they cannot be readily localized. All low frequency information is sent to the subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it's possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one <b>channel</b> <b>is</b> out of phase with another.|$|E

40|$|ATP-sensitive {{potassium}} (KATP) <b>channels</b> <b>are</b> a major drug {{target for}} the treatment of type- 2 diabetes.

Also, KATP <b>channels</b> <b>are</b> involved in the protection against neuronal seizures and ischaemic stress in the heart, brain and in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle tone. Functional KATP <b>channels</b> <b>are</b> hetero-octamers composed of two subunits, a pore forming Kir 6, which {{is a member of the}} inwardly rectifying potassium channels family, and a regulatory sulphonylurea receptor (SUR).
