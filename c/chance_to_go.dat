5|$|Richard Smith {{was active}} in the field of comedy, and participated in the {{vaudeville}} scene. He met his wife Alice Howell when {{she was a member of}} a production by DeWolf Hopper, in 1910. The two utilized the title of a previously known vaudeville group, and performed together as Howell and Howell. The Howell and Howell duo performed together for three years. Their performances included burlesque and vaudeville. Mack Sennett directed Smith at the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company in New York City. Sennett offered Smith a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with him when he started the company Keystone Studios, but he declined the opportunity.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{expedition}} it took the combined efforts of two relief ships and the use of explosives to free Discovery from the ice. His insistence during {{the expedition}} on Royal Navy formalities had made for uneasy relations with the merchant navy contingent, many of whom departed for home with the first relief ship in March 1903. Second-in-command Albert Armitage, a merchant officer, was offered the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home on compassionate grounds, but chose to interpret the offer as a personal slight, and refused. Armitage also promoted the idea that the decision to send Shackleton home on the relief ship arose from Scott's animosity rather than Shackleton's physical breakdown. Although there were later tensions between Scott and Shackleton, when their polar ambitions directly clashed, in public mutual civilities were preserved; Scott joined in the official receptions that greeted Shackleton on his return in 1909 after the Nimrod Expedition, and the two were exchanging polite letters about their respective ambitions in 1909–10.|$|E
5|$|Cogan joined Gillingham in June 2007, being tipped by {{new manager}} Ronnie Jepson {{to fill the}} void left by Matt Jarvis, who had joined Wolverhampton Wanderers. He made his debut for Gillingham in the 3–0 defeat at Watford in the League Cup on 14 August, and scored his first goal for the club in the 3–1 home victory over Leyton Orient on 2 October 2007. Following a string of bad results, Jepson resigned, and Mark Stimson was named as his {{permanent}} replacement in November 2007. Stimson saw Cogan as surplus to requirements, and offered him a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out on loan in February 2008. He rejected this initial chance, but subsequently joined Grays Athletic for a month on 14 March 2008, scoring five goals in thirteen Conference National matches. Gillingham released Cogan {{at the end of the}} 2007–08 season, after he made just 21 appearances in all competitions.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United drew {{their first}} and only home blank of the season against Newcastle United, but made amends with a 3–2 victory over bottom team Blackburn Rovers. Defensive frailties, most notably from Schmeichel, were on show away to Sheffield Wednesday as the team missed the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> top of the table. A brace from winger Jens Niclas Alexandersson and a debut goal scored by Wim Jonk {{consigned}} Ferguson to his second defeat {{in the league and}} extended a barren run at Hillsborough; United had won only a single game in their last eight visits. On 29 November, Manchester United hosted Leeds United and a valiant performance by the visitors looked to have gained them a draw, after going two goals down in the first half. A moment of brilliance from Butt however secured the three points for the Red Devils and kept up the pressure on the challengers.|$|E

Abi is defensive of her father and she argues with Kirsty about it, blaming her for her family's breakdown.|$|E

After the fall of two early wickets, Ponting and Hussey, who was {{promoted}} to No. 4 instead of Damien Martyn, formed a steady partnership to guide Australia to victory. Ponting fell on 49 but the battle was well over. Hussey scored the winning runs and made 61 not out from 66 balls. His partner, Michael Clarke, scored 21 not out.|$|E

In an otherwise triumphant visit to Greensboro Coliseum for the 2006 ACC Tournament and early NCAA Tournament games, Redick struggled at the line, lowering his career free-throw percentage by about 0.5% and finishing his career with 91.16% (660 out of 724).|$|E

Meanwhile, they lost their National League lead without playing a game, as Sussex Sharks beat Kent Spitfires to go top - and six days later, when Durham had the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> past Sussex again, they lost to Warwickshire in a game {{featuring}} less than 300 runs in total. Durham rounded off the month with three matches without loss, however, as they beat Derbyshire in the League and Somerset in the Championship to have a 24.5-point lead {{at the end of the}} month. In the League, however, Warwickshire overtook them as they fell to third place.|$|E

25|$|The {{first half}} of the National Championship game was tightly fought, with neither team taking a lead larger than five points in the first 19 minutes. In the last minute of the half, North Carolina briefly went up by seven points, and had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> up by nine. However, Villanova's Josh Hart blocked a layup attempt, which led to a Phil Booth jump shot {{at the other end of}} the court, cutting the deficit to 39–34 as the clock expired. At halftime, Joel Berry II of the Tar Heels led all players with 15 points. Despite {{entering}} the game ranked only 294th out of all 351 Division I teams in three-point shooting, North Carolina hit seven of their nine three-point attempt in the first half. However, the Tar Heels hit just 32% of their two-point attempts. Villanova had the edge in points the paint by a 18–12 margin, connecting on 65% on their two-point shots. The Tar Heels led in fast break points by a 10–2 margin and collected five offensive rebounds compared to only one for Villanova. Villanova's Kris Jenkins played just four minutes in the half after getting into early foul trouble.|$|E
25|$|Marseille are up {{to second}} in Ligue 1 after they emerged victorious over a ten-man Paris Saint-Germain in the 'classico'. Toulouse {{continued}} their string of strong results with a comprehensive win at home to Paris, their tenth victory in 14 matches in all competitions in 2009, to climb back to fourth place on the Ligue 1 table. Paris Saint-Germain beat Nice at the Parc des Princes to maintain their title challenge. Lille's goalless draw with visiting Paris {{was a case of}} two points dropped against an uninspired opposition and did little to help either side's fortunes, with both clubs leapfrogged by Toulouse, winners over Nantes. Paris Saint-German moved into fourth place as the club from the capital eased past bottom side Le Havre. Lyon and Paris Saint-Germain raised the curtain on a decisive weekend of football with a heart-stopping draw at the Stade Gerland which, in the end, suited neither side. Paris Saint-Germain missed out on the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> above Lyon into third as they were narrowly beaten by Rennes. Mateja Kezman's second league goal of the season gave Paris Saint-Germain a narrow win at Le Mans to keep them in contention for a top-three finish. Paris saw their chances of overtaking Lyon into third place and a Champions League qualifying spot dealt a blow as they succumbed to in-form Auxerre at the Parc des Princes. PSG's ambitions of European football were in the balance after they saw a stubborn Valenciennes side come from behind at the Stade Nungesser. Paris needed to win at home to Monaco to clinch fourth or fifth and a place in Europe next season, but a tepid display from Paul Le Guen's men in a goalless draw left them empty-handed after being tipped as potential title contenders throughout the season.|$|E
