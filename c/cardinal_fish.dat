40|$|The author {{observed}} the spawning behavior of Apogon notatus (HOUTTUYN), {{one of the}} mouth-breeding <b>cardinal</b> <b>fishes</b> in the southern Japan, at Sakurajima Aquarium of Kagoshima and in the natural habitat near the aquarium. They spawn in July to September, at temperatures of 24 to 29 degrees. Their spawning size measures usually 80 to 90 mm or more in total length. They mate 7 to 10 days prior to spawning. In mating, the pair separate themselves from the school at {{a corner of the}} tank in the aquarium and drive off all the fishes coming near. The courtship is mainly expressed by the female at first, and normally {{a few days before the}} spawning, the male begins to respond to it. At the spawning, the pair swim side by side firstly, then the male turns himself upsidedown, so that his belly approximately comes in contact with hers. In this way the eggs are layed in a mass and inseminated readily. After a few seconds, the male holds the egg mass, which is still attaching to the genital opening of the female, in his mouth. After the spawing, the male joins the school and shows no more attention to the female. The eggs survived for only two days or less in the aquarium, so the development was not observed. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract OnlyThe {{significant}} revenue {{involved in}} marine aquarium trade notwithstanding, {{in developing countries}} generates gainful employment and alternate livelihood in rural sector to fishers. Despite rich biodiversity of marine ornamental fishes and ideal milieu for expansion of trade the sector remains at infancy. However, absence of primary database on marketing is a major handicap in expansion and regulation of this sector. This study focused on status of demand, supply and potentials of marine aquarium fish trade. The study covered demand and supply entities including suppliers, hobbyists and aquarium keepers. The results documents prominence of aquarium industry and portray the challenges in expanding domestic trade in Kerala. The preferred candidates in trade in Kerala include damsel fish, wrasse, butterfly fish, trigger <b>fish</b> and <b>cardinal</b> <b>fishes.</b> Hobbyist‚ awareness, interests and willingness to keep marine fishes was high despite negligible trade. The demand and purchasing power of hobbyists is undoubtedly {{the single most important}} force in determining potential and profitability of marine aquarium industry in Kerala. Maintenance and upkeep snags, technological lag, institutional support and high mortality were the major problems in the sector. The resources are currently being unexploited or discarded. The sector could provide alternative avocation for fishermen if state of art technologies for collection, handling and transport are developed integrating with conservation and sustainable development objectives. The marine aquarium trade of Kerala needs to capitalize on key strength of unexploited resources by alleviating major weaknesses of technological lag and harnessing the opportunities of tapping the huge demand for improving trade...|$|R
40|$|Equatorial {{populations of}} marine species are {{predicted}} {{to be most}} impacted by global warming because they could be adapted to a narrow range of temperatures in their local environment. We investigated the thermal range at which aerobic metabolic performance is optimum in equatorial populations of coral reef fish in northern Papua New Guinea. Four species of damselfishes and two species of <b>cardinal</b> <b>fishes</b> were held for 14 days at 29, 31, 33, and 34 °C, which incorporated their existing thermal range (29 – 31 °C) as well as projected increases in ocean surface temperatures of up to 3 °C {{by the end of}} this century. Resting and maximum oxygen consumption rates were measured for each species at each temperature and used to calculate the thermal reaction norm of aerobic scope. Our results indicate that one of the six species, Chromis atripectoralis, is already living above its thermal optimum of 29 °C. The other five species appeared to be living close to their thermal optima (ca. 31 °C). Aerobic scope was significantly reduced in all species, and approached zero for two species at 3 °C above current-day temperatures. One species was unable to survive even short-term exposure to 34 °C. Our results indicate that low-latitude reef fish populations are living close to their thermal optima and may be more sensitive to ocean warming than higher-latitude populations. Even relatively small temperature increases (2 – 3 °C) could result in population declines and potentially redistribution of equatorial species to higher latitudes if adaptation cannot keep pace...|$|R
40|$|The author {{studied the}} {{morphological}} characters and the feeding habits of Apogon lineatus in Ômura-Bay which were {{caught by the}} shrimp drag nets {{in the last six}} years. The results obtained are as follows: 1. Among the <b>cardinal</b> <b>fishes</b> in Ômura-Bay, Apogon lineatus is the most common, while A. semilineatus, A. kiensis, and A. niger are seen scarcely. Apogonichthys carinatus is found in Ainoura-Bay, but not in Omura-Bay. 2. From the view of monthly changes of body length, the life span of A. lin. is supposed as one year. The max. length of female is 78 mm and that of male is 74 mm. The relation of the total length to the body length is well shown by the following formula, TL=BL× 1. 23 (in mm). 3. The growth rate is different between male and female, namely that of female is faster than male, and there is about 10 mm difference in body length in one year. 4. Both sexes of A. lin. in Ainoura-Bay are ca. 5 mm bigger than those in Ômura-Bay. 5. Body weight shows its max. in August and min. in February. 6. The dentition on the club-shaped gill rakers of male specimens are covered with soft muscular membrane at their spawning season. 7. The spawning season extends from July to October, and its peak occurs in August. At that time the ovary grows very large, while the testis is very small and less than 1 / 200 of the ovary in weight. 8. Number of gill rakers of first gill arch is commonly 14 (upper 3, lower 11) except small prickles; number of pyrolic appendages is 3; and number of vertebrae is 23. 9. Isthmus of almost all male specimens protrude oddly at the spawning season. 10. A. lin. is carnivorous and from its predacious habit it seems that it is living a little above the sea bottom. 11. Male specimens eat eggs of their own relatives at their spawning season without exception, and it is presumably regarded that the male will swallow a part of eggs when they accept the eggs in their mouth to breed. At this season no other food are eaten by the male, {{but in the case of}} female small crustaceans are eaten abundantly. 1. 大村湾内のApogonidaeはテンジクダイを主とし,その他ネンブツダイ,テツポウイシモチ,クロイシモチが僅か見られた。近接した相浦湾にはマトイシモチが少くないが,大村湾には見られない。 2. 体長の月別頻度分布からテンジクダイは一年魚であるとした。今までに大村湾で得られた最大のものは♀ 78 mm,♂ 74 mmであつた。全長と体長との関係はTL=BL× 1. 2 + 3 (mm) で表わされる。 3. ♀♂ で成長が異り,♀ の方が速く,一年間に約 10 mmの差が生ずる。 4. 相浦湾と大村湾では前者の方が♀♂共に約 5 mm大きい。 5. 同じ体長のものゝ体重は 2 月が最小 8 月が最大となる。 6. 幽門垂は大小合せて 3 本， 脊椎骨数 23,第一鰓弓の鰓把は上肢 3 下肢 11 計 14 が最も普通(たゞしprickleを除く) 。 7. 産卵期は 7 月から 10 月中旬で, 8 月が最盛期,卵巣は体重の 1 / 5 に達する大きいものがあるが,精巣は甚だ小く,卵巣の 1 / 200 以下である。 8. 産卵期には♂ の鰓把上の小刺列が袋を被る。これは口中抱卵の卵を傷けぬための自然の適応であろう。 9 ・産卵期の♂ は峡部著しく膨出し,奇型を呈する。♀にも若干見られ,♀ の口内抱卵も稀には存在するものと推測される。 10. 食餌は全く動物性のもので,その種類から見てテンジクダイは底上魚の性質を示す。 11. ♂ は産卵期には口中抱卵のため全く餌を食つていないが,同族の卵をほとんど例外なくその胃中に発見する。♀は卵を食することはなく,甲殻類などの天然餌料を盛んに摂食している...|$|R

40|$|Length–weight {{relationship}} (LWR) {{and relative}} condition factor (Kn) of wild Paracheirodon axelrodi after caught and simulated transport were investigated. These fish were random distributed in two groups: wild fish (pre-transport) and after caught (post- transport). For each group the body weight and total length were measured to determination from LWR and Kn. The LWR {{of fish in}} pre-transport was Wt = 0. 014 Lt 2. 528 (r 2 = 0. 966) and in post-transport was Wt = 0. 010 Lt 2. 848 (r 2 = 0. 956). Both groups had a negative allometric growth and differences between values of b (p< 0. 001) were observed. Body weight of fish and Kn were lower during post-transport.   Results demonstrated that post-transport is crucial phase in the extractives fishery from P. axelrodi, due to poor body conditions of the fish, which was indicated by the LWR and Kn. Therefore, they indicates the necessity of improve in the management techniques {{during and after the}} caught of this ornamental fish from Amazonian.

Os peixes foram divididos aleatoriamente em dois grupos: habitat natural (pré-transporte) e após a captura e transporte (pós-transporte). Em cada grupo foram medidos a massa corporal (Wt) e comprimentou total (Lt) para determinação da RPC e Kn em diferentes faixas de tamanho. A RPC do grupo pré-transporte foi Wt = 0, 014 Lt 2, 528 (r 2 = 0, 966) e grupo pós-transporte foi Wt = 0, 010 Lt 2, 848 (r 2 = 0, 956). Ambos os grupos apresentaram alometria negativa e houve diferença entre o valor de b entre grupos estudados. As médias do peso real dos peixes e Kn foram menores no grupo pós-transporte. Os resultados demonstram que o pós-transporte é uma etapa crítica na cadeia extrativista de P. axelrodi devido às baixas condições corporais dos peixes indicada pela RPC e Kn.
