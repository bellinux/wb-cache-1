5|$|Shortly after Kimball married, {{his father}} <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> serve as clerk for the St. Joseph Stake. In the 1920s, local stake clerks still {{performed}} the extensive record-keeping and reporting duties {{that are now}} digitized and done centrally at the LDS Church's headquarters in Salt Lake City. The position of stake clerk was essentially a part-time job, and those called were paid a monthly salary of $50.|$|E
5|$|Astana was {{at first}} not invited to the Giro. Six days before the race began, RCS Sport (the {{organizers}} of the Giro) went back on the decision to exclude Astana and extended them a late invitation. This change of heart was at least partly contingent on Contador, Leipheimer, and Klöden participating in the race. Having thought for two months prior {{that they would not}} compete in the Giro, most of Astana's riders had planned to take a break during the Tour of Italy, and Contador was actually vacationing on a beach when Bruyneel <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> tell him the team was headed to the Giro.|$|E

5|$|Jim Elliot {{first heard}} of the Huaorani in 1950 from a former missionary to Ecuador, and {{afterwards}} indicated that God had <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Ecuador to evangelize the Huaorani. He began corresponding with his friend Pete Fleming about his desire to minister in Ecuador, and in 1952 the two men set sail for Guayaquil as missionaries with the Plymouth Brethren. For six months they lived in Quito {{with the goal of}} learning Spanish. They then moved to Shandia, a Quechua mission station deep in the Ecuadorian jungle. There they worked under the supervision of a Christian Missions in Many Lands missionary, Wilfred Tidmarsh, and began exposing themselves to the culture and studying the Quechua language.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{principal}} RPF targets in Ruhengeri was the prison, which was Rwanda's largest. When he learned of the invasion the warden, Charles Uwihoreye, telephoned the government in Kigali, to request instructions. He spoke to Colonel Elie Sagatwa, one of the akazu, who ordered him to kill every inmate in the prison, to avoid escape and defections during the fighting, and to prevent high-profile political prisoners and former insiders from sharing secret information with the RPF. Uwihoreye refused to obey, even after Sagatwa <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> repeat the order, having confirmed it with the president. Eventually the RPF stormed the buildings, and the prisoners were saved. Several prisoners were recruited into the RPF, including Theoneste Lizinde, a former close ally of President Habyarimana, who had been arrested following a failed coup attempt in 1980.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} before Poland was invaded by Germany in September 1939, and during the {{invasion}} itself, Sikorski's request for a military command continued to be denied by the Polish Commander in Chief, Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły. Sikorski escaped through Romania to Paris, where on 28 September he joined Władysław Raczkiewicz and Stanisław Mikołajczyk in a Polish government-in-exile, taking command of the newly formed Polish Armed Forces in France. Two days later, on September 30, president Raczkiewicz <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> serve as the first Polish prime minister in exile. On 7 November he became Commander in Chief and General Inspector of the Armed Forces (Naczelny Wódz i Generalny Inspektor Sił Zbrojnych), following Rydz-Śmigły's resignation. Sikorski would also hold {{the position of the}} Polish Minister of Military Affairs, thus uniting in his person all control over the Polish military in war time.|$|E

5|$|That same offseason, Trevor Hoffman {{retired as}} the all-time regular season saves leader {{with a final}} tally of 601, leaving Rivera as the active leader in saves and 42 behind Hoffman's record to start 2011. Rivera's season was marked by several milestones. He broke the all-time record for games finished, and in May, he became the 15th pitcher to make 1,000appearances {{and the first to}} do so with a single team. He was named an All-Star for the 12th time with a 1.85ERA and 22saves in 26opportunities at the midseason break, but for the second {{consecutive}} year, he skipped the game to rest injuries. His pursuit of Hoffman's saves record reached a climax in the final month of the season; on September13, he collected his 600th save, making him just the second pitcher to accomplish the feat. Four days later, he saved his 601st game, tying him with Hoffman for the most in MLB history. Rivera broke the record on September19 at Yankee Stadium by closing out a 6–4 win against the Twins, the final out by strikeout. After the game, Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> offer his congratulations. Rivera finished the season with a 1.91ERA, a 0.90WHIP, and 44saves in 49opportunities, making him the first pitcher over the age of 40 to save at least 40games in a season. In the offseason, he underwent throat surgery to remove polyps from his vocal cords.|$|E

60|$|He moved a step nearer. This {{time she}} {{made no effort to}} retreat. Once more she was {{trembling}} a little, but her face was soft and sweet. All the pallor, the hard lines, the suffering seemed to have passed miraculously out of it. A soul--a woman's soul--was shining at him out of her eyes. It wasn't her physical self that spoke--in a way he knew that. Yet she was <b>calling</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>calling</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> with all she possessed, <b>calling</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as <b>to</b> her master.|$|R

25|$|According to the Book of Joshua, Abraham {{came from}} a land and a family that worshiped strange gods.

25|$|The Seljuq {{state had}} started to split into small emirates (beyliks) that {{increasingly}} distanced themselves from both Mongol and Seljuq control. In 1277, responding to a call from Anatolia, the Mamluk sultan, Baibars, raided Anatolia and defeated the Mongols, temporarily replacing them as the administrator of the Seljuq realm. But since the native forces who had <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Anatolia did not manifest themselves {{for the defense of}} the land, he had to return to his home base in Egypt, and the Mongol administration was re-assumed, officially and severely. Also, the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia captured the Mediterranean coast from Selinos to Seleucia, as well as the cities of Marash and Behisni, from the Seljuq in the 1240s.|$|E
25|$|Bragg's {{articles}} came to {{the attention}} of Representative James G. Clinton, a New York Democrat and political opponent of Scott's.

Scott ordered him not to testify, in defiance of the Congressional subpoena. Bragg was arrested and sent to Fort Monroe, Virginia, where he was court-martialed for disobedience to orders and disrespect toward his superior officers. Bragg conducted his own defense and attempted to turn the trial into a condemnation of Scott. He was found guilty, but an official reprimand from the Secretary of War and suspension at half pay for two months were relatively mild punishments, and Bragg was not deterred from future criticisms of his superiors.|$|E

The Head of SLC Thilanga Sumathipala warned Muralitharan for attempting to coach the Australian team, the team which gave more pressure to Muralitharan in the past due to his bowling actions.Muralitharan also said that the team which was totally against him now <b>called</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> coach them to play against Sri Lanka was a big victory in his career.|$|E
