5|$|If {{you do not}} {{hurry to}} fight at sea, but keep your ships here and stay near land, or even advance into the Peloponnese, then, my lord, you will easily {{accomplish}} what you had in mind on <b>coming</b> <b>here.</b> The Hellenes {{are not able to}} hold out against you for a long time, but you will scatter them, and they will each flee to their own cities.|$|E

25|$|The Querétaro {{metropolitan}} area comprises {{the municipalities of}} Querétaro, Corregidora, El Marqués and Huimilpan with a total population in 2010 of 1,097,028. According to data from the National Population Council, Querétaro is the 10th largest metro area in Mexico, {{as well as the}} 128th largest in the Americas. The {{metropolitan area}} of Querétaro has seen a population growth of between 3.65 and 5.54 percent per year since {{the second half of the}} 1990s, which makes it the fifth fastest-growing in the country behind Cancún, Tijuana, Puerto Vallarta, Ciudad Juárez and Nuevo Laredo. The population of the metro area in 2005 was 738,921, with 58% living outside of Querétaro city proper. The municipality of Corregidora has the highest rate of population growth in the state at 5.54%. Most of the population growth is due to migration with people <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> from Mexico City, Mexico State and Guanajuato. It is estimated that in 2005, 10,465 people migrated to the metropolitan area.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{attraction}} is the Bosque de los Arboles de Navidad (Christmas Tree Forest), {{one of the}} few places in Mexico where one can go and cut his/her own tree. The Bosque plants trees such as the “vikingo mexiquense” and the “vikingo canadiense” <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> has become a tradition for many families in the Mexico City area. It is a business that was conceived forty years ago as a way to help preserve the forest here as well as benefit economically. Visitors come to spend a day in the area and can cut trees only from designated locations. Picnicking is permitted with the requirement that no garbage is left behind. The Christmas tree area covers 300 acres (120 hectares), and cut trees are left to regrow instead of being killed. The park also hosts food stalls and a Christmas market, selling about 30,000 trees per year and employing 50 permanent and 250 seasonal workers.The money earned from the enterprise helps to preserve more wild areas of the mountains here. This work has earned a Premio Nacional de Ecología (National Ecology Prize). The only problem the forest experiences is that the enterprise is so popular that the roads leading to the area are jammed with traffic.|$|E
