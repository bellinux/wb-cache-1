40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical {{investigation into the}} relationship between uncertainty and ex ante U. S. labor <b>contract</b> <b>durations</b> over the period 1970 to 1995. Using a structural identification of aggregate demand and aggregate supply shocks, we find that desired <b>contract</b> <b>durations</b> are shorter during periods of heightened nominal or real uncertainty. This evidence supports the view that labor <b>contract</b> <b>durations</b> respond endogenously to the aggregate uncertainty prevailing {{at the time they}} are negotiated, but suggests that risk-sharing concerns are not paramount. The analysis also considers several measures of inflation uncertainty that have appeared in the literature. The results generally corroborate previous findings of an inverse relationship between desired <b>contract</b> <b>durations</b> and the level of inflation uncertainty.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{economic}} implications of different <b>contract</b> <b>durations</b> in markets for on-line (primary and secondary) reserve capacity in Germany with the crucial feature of separate markets for spot energy and reserve capacity provision. The analysis {{is based on}} an equilibrium model developed by Just and Weber (2008) for reserve markets. It reveals the implicit trade-off for the bidders and interdependencies between the reserve and the spot markets. The results clearly show that shorter periods (with resulting lower variations in overall electricity demand) lead to more efficient dispatch and market results. Not only prices in the reserve capacity markets are expected to be lower, but also spot market prices. As these benefits can be partially reaped by owners of large generation portfolios also under longer <b>contract</b> <b>durations,</b> it discriminates smaller generation companies and can potentially deter market participation. Further, the paper discusses security concerns against shorter <b>contract</b> <b>durations.</b> It is shown that the opportunity costs character of the reserve market implies sufficient incentives for supplying online reserve capacity.

When combined with evidence that ex ante <b>contract</b> <b>durations</b> are shorter during episodes of increased inflation uncertainty, our results suggest that these contracts are flexible both ex ante and ex post to changes in the evolution of inflation.

This obligated The United States Forest Service to provide 13.5 billion board feet of timber to pulp companies, and allowed pulp mills to take control of selecting harvesting. This act also required the United States Forest Service to take up much of the logging and manufacturing costs, and awarding pulp companyâs credits dollar for dollar on logging roads that were constructed.|$|E
30|$|Following out {{theoretical}} expectations unemployed {{respondents in}} general display a higher job offer acceptance compared with employed individuals.

Regarding their willingness to make concessions both groups behave similarly, {{with the exception of}} jobs with <b>contract</b> <b>durations</b> limited to one year. These job offers reduce the acceptance of unemployed individuals much less than that of employed individuals. Increasing duration of unemployed does also not increase acceptance of jobs with unfavourable characteristics. On the contrast, long term unemployed individuals seem to suffer from discouragement effects, which lead them to reject interregional offers that imply higher relocation costs.|$|R

40|$|The risk-incentive {{model of}} principal-agent {{relations}} and its extensions to infrastructural public-private partnerships outline the efficiency implications of parameters such as <b>contract</b> <b>duration.</b> The predominant focus on individual contracts is of limited use for public agencies {{that need to}} allocate their resources efficiently {{at the level of}} the entire asset network.

As discussed in Jacoby et al. (2002), reallocation of lands is promoted by local governments because of the following: first, following the demographic change within households, it helps to keep an egalitarian distribution of land (Kung, 1994); second, it reduces the inefficiencies often created by the distribution of land which happens with householdsâ demographic changes, especially in contexts with land rental and labor markets failure (Li 1999; Benjamin and Brandt 2000); and third, it represents for local governments a tool to collect taxes and achieve production quotas (Rozelle and Li 1998).|$|R

30|$|Currently, the {{supplier}} switching process of retail {{customers in the}} German energy market takes several days up to 3 weeks, since it involves numerous steps of data exchange, validation and confirmation between all affected market roles.
