40|$|Based on {{available}} literature, {{we collected}} and presented in tables {{the values of}} optimal precipitation (for some field-cultivated vegetables) which are still sometimes used in Poland. We also included a short sum-mary of how they are defined and how the necessary corrections are in-troduced. Included optimal precipitation values have been developed by: Dzieżycet al., Grabarczyk, Klatt and Press. Therefore, {{it is possible to}} define (estimate) precipitation deficits for specific species of vegeta-bles depending on the temperature or soil weight <b>classification</b> (<b>light,</b> medium, heavy) in various regions of Poland. By recognising optimal precipitation, we can plan, design or introduce irrigation and manage it. The formulas developed by Grabarczyk offer an additional possibili-ty of calculating expected average increase (growth) of vegetable crops as a result of irrigation within various precipitation zones in Poland.

40|$|Forest verges to paddy {{fields on}} {{lowermost}} hillside slopes are {{considered one of}} the most important habitats not only for managing forest species but also for serni-natural meadow species and species in wet conditions in the Satoyama landscape. To clarify the floristic composition of the verges in relation to environmental characteristics such as light intensity, surface soil water content, slope, slope direction and soil thickness, we sampled 33 research plots in the Tama Hills, central Japan. The results showed that although geomorphic locations were almost the same, light intensity and surface soil water content varied among plots, and these differences affected species composition. In the compositional groups of TWINSPAN <b>classification,</b> <b>light</b> intensity and surface soil water content were the principal factors that affected plant species composition. Brighter conditions due to mowing management as well as slope direction significantly enhanced the number of both meadow species and species in fields or at roadsides, while wetter conditions due to the location of aquifer and the difference in soil thickness meant a significant increase in the abundance of wetland species...|$|E

25|$|There are {{distinguishable}} {{differences between}} the EMD models and the Canadian GMD-built models. Most notable are the headlight configurations. The biggest giveaway is the rear light. GMD SD40-2s have a single beam, where EMD has twin-beam styled lights, usually placed next to each other. GMD models also have lights mounted on the nose, and EMD is above the cab between the numberboards. Some EMD variations have a nose headlight, although the headlight style and placement usually isn't the same as seen on the GMDs. Other features on the GMD models include the bell mounted above the cab between the numbers, triple-style <b>classification</b> <b>lights</b> above the numbers(since trains don't use classlights anymore, many locomotives have had them removed), and no numberboards on the back.|$|R

40|$|Purpose—To compare {{simple and}} complex {{modeling}} techniques to estimate categories of low, medium, and high ventilation (VE) from ActiGraph™ activity counts. Methods—Vertical axis ActiGraph™ GT 1 M activity counts, oxygen consumption and VE were measured during treadmill walking and running, sports, household chores and labor-intensive employment activities.

5000|$|The GS-5s are {{identical}} in appearance to the GS-4s, {{the only difference}} being the roller bearings that gave the locomotive a smoother ride and added weight. 4458 had roller bearings from the Timken Company and 4459 used SKF brand roller bearings. They had a silver smokebox with a dual-headlight casing (top headlight was a mars light), and an enclosed, all-weather cab. It retained the skyline casing {{on the top of}} the boiler, skirting on the sides, an air horn (for use at speeds due to being louder than the whistle which was rarely if ever used on the main line) and teardrop <b>classification</b> <b>lights.</b> They received the orange and red [...] "Daylight" [...] paint scheme. The GS-5's were designed for high-speed passenger service on Southern Pacific's premier passenger trains, the Coast Daylight, San Joaquin Daylight and Sunset Limited.

40|$|Oftentimes, {{architects and}} {{lighting}} designers {{do not fully}} utilize natural daylight when designing buildings and lighting systems. Buildings with artificial lighting systems are simpler to design and analyze. However, doing so would forgo some of the ecological, social, and economical benefits of daylight. Current simulation tools for predicting visual quality and energy use of architectural lighting systems are not very informative or useful when concerning the use of daylight. Photorealistic renderings produced {{by a number of}} simulation systems are only relevant for a specific set of variables, including time, season, and sky condition. For instance, the distribution, intensity, and angle of daylight can change rapidly during the day. Also, lighting quality depends upon viewer direction and location within a room, and current tools provide little assistance for managing multiple viewpoints. Tools that aggregate these results do so only at the expense of compromising fine-grained analysis details.

Objective: to evaluate the medical attention to the asthmatic patient in the Area III polyclinic of Cienfuegos. Methods: Transversal and descriptive study that included 150 patients randomly selected from the dispensary records of the Area III Educational Polyclinic of Cienfuegos, in December 2001.
