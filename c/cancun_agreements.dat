50|$|A {{number of}} analysts have {{focussed}} {{on the need}} to establish a global price on carbon in order to reduce emissions cost-effectively. The Kyoto treaty does not set a global price for carbon. As stated earlier, the US {{is not part of the}} Kyoto treaty, and is a major contributor to global annual emissions of carbon dioxide (see also greenhouse gas#Regional and national attribution of emissions). Additionally, the treaty does not place caps on emissions in developing countries. The lack of caps for developing countries was based on equity (fairness) considerations (see Kyoto Protocol#Negotiations for more information). Developing countries, however, have undertaken a range of policies to reduce their emissions domestically.

This thesis seeks to find out how indigenous peoples and local communities participated in the making of the national REDD+ strategy in Indonesia, and why the participation took the form it did.

Contrary to the general perception, the present analysis shows that India is currently experiencing deforestation and forest degradation. According to the latest assessment of the Forest Survey of India, the net annual loss of forests is estimated to be 99, 850 ha during the period 2007 - 2009, even though the total area under forests has increased. The REDD+ mechanism aims to provide financial incentives for reducing deforestation and forest degradation.

40|$|Abstract Global warming or {{climate change}} is the most {{critical}} and strategic issue of 21 st Century. For the last 25 years i. e. from 1985, global warming summits have been taking place. But the real breakthrough has not been come up and the same has become a distant dream. Copenhagen or COP 15 Accord made some head way and as a result, global leaders took note of it. But the same was not considered as a decision and hence, there was no legal binding on the members in respect of cut in global carbon dioxide emissions (chart). Keeping in mind the out come of Copenhagen Summit, {{it was believed that}} Cancun summit would give some concrete {{solution to the problem of}} global warming or climate change. The Cancun summit out come is mixture of optimism, consensus and compromises. Therefore, the present paper examines <b>Cancun</b> <b>agreement</b> at a glance and the reasons for optimism, consensus and compromises.

40|$|There is {{very little}} {{elaboration}} in literature of the phrase "equitable access to sustainable development" that is referenced in the <b>Cancun</b> <b>Agreement</b> on climate change. We interpret this at a minimum as people's right to a decent living standard, which gives rise to claims by countries to an exemption from mitigation for the energy and emissions needed to provide a decent life to all. We elaborate a conceptual framework for a comprehensive quantification of such an energy requirement, including the energy required to build out infrastructure to support these living standards. We interpret decent living as the consumption by households {{of a set of}} basic goods including adequate nutrition, shelter, health care, education, transport, refrigeration, television and mobile phones. We develop universal indicators for these activities and their infrastructure requirements, and specify a methodology to convert these to energy requirements using energy input-output analysis. Our main recommendations include estimating bottom-up, country-specific energy and emissions requirements, incorporating a minimum for methane emissions, and using international benchmarks at the sector level to encourage the reduction of countries' energy and emissions intensity...|$|R

This Study uses Porter's Diamond model and a case study to analyze the developing strategy of Green Energy Industry Cluster, especially for the solar photoelectric industry in Taiwan. We follow the following 4 procedures to process this research: 1. Identify the local environmental advantage. 2.

The paper expresses the view that seeking systemic change through the agricultural negotiations would be less confrontational as current texts on modalities provide little scope for introducing significant cuts in cotton subsidies. However, it maintains that the 'special products' concept could potentially offer a way forward, if it is extended beyond domestic food security products to cover all products central to poverty alleviation in least developed countries.

40|$|As {{argued in}} the 2011 UN Green Economy Report, the world {{currently}} faces an important opportunity {{to move from}} current resource depleting, polluting and wasteful forms of economic growth to a new, low-carbon, sustainable green economy. New markets and industries are emerging, for clean renewable energy, environmental goods and services, local organic agriculture, and payment for ecosystem services. International economic law is evolving rapidly, and could foster rather than frustrate this shift. With more than 350 trade treaties, over 2, 700 investment accords, new international disputes on resources, environment and development issues, and regimes like the UN Climate Convention <b>Cancun</b> <b>Agreement</b> or the UN Biodiversity Convention Nagoya Protocol adopting new economic instruments, it remains somewhat unclear how international rules can guide governments and markets.

50|$|The {{parties to}} the {{convention}} have met annually from 1995 in Conferences of the Parties (COP) to assess progress in dealing with climate change. In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol was concluded and established legally binding obligations for developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in the period 2008-2012. The 2010 <b>Cancún</b> <b>agreements</b> state that future global warming {{should be limited to}} below 2.0 °C (3.6 °F) relative to the pre-industrial level.

30|$|In {{order to}} achieve the {{emissions}} target to limit the increase in global average temperature {{to a maximum of}} 2  °C above pre-industrialized levels, the 16 th Conference of the Parties (COP 16) or “Cancun agreement” requires that the Annex I parties reduce emissions in the range of 25 – 40  % below 1990 levels by 2020 towards building a low-carbon society. A low-carbon society (LCS) or low-fossil-fuel economy is a concept that refers to an economy which has a minimal output of GHG emissions into the biosphere. LCS also stands for the low-carbonization in all aspects of a society including economy, culture and life (Yuan et al. 2011), but specifically refers to the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (Winyuchakrit et al. 2011 a). However, in 2010, the <b>Cancun</b> <b>agreement</b> recognized that the developing countries should contribution to the mitigation endeavor in the context of “sustainable development” to meet their emission target. The LCS concept has been adopted by developed countries, e.g., establishing a mandatory target of renewable energy consumption in the European Union (Carvalho et al. 2011). The target of GHG mitigation has been committed by Japan and the United States in Japan-U.S. Summit Meeting (2009), etc. In developing counties, {{there are a variety of}} geographic features, cultures, incomes and life styles, and developing countries are also concerned about sustainable development through the LCS mechanism as shown in a number of relevant studies. For instance, the proposed low mitigation scenarios (2.6  W/m 2) are employed by India and China to achieve LCS (Calvin et al. 2012), the benefits of low carbon development of Nepal were analyzed through the MARKAL model (Sherstha and Shakya 2012), etc. Presently Thailand is a developing country and categorized as non-Annex I country that has no commitment to any quantitative objectives under the KP but realizes that achieving those objectives is the common problem of all countries. Thus, Thailand has designed a low carbon society within the context of sustainable development using the approach of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), which has been intensively studied in order to prepare and propose achievable measures for sustainable development. Sritong et al. (2011) presented the potential of renewable power generation in Thailand for CO 2 mitigation under the framework of NAMAs. Additionally, Winyuchakrit et al. (2011 b) gathered the information concerning GHG mitigation strategies and analyzed the opportunities for reducing GHG emissions in Thailand in 2020.|$|R
