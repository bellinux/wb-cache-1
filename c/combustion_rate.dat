After analyzing TGA/DTG, petrochemical sludge shows a rapid weight reduction by vaporing of inner moisture after 170 ℃.

In this study, volatiles and char combustion behaviour of the fuel pellets composed from demineralised lignite and poplar wood sawdust, were investigated in a cylindrical wire mesh basket placed in a preheated tube furnace. The results have shown that ignition times of the pellets decreased with the burning temperature and shortened further due to demineralisation of lignite.

50|$|The Baron {{occupied}} {{himself in}} 1849 with technical work, especially intensive with the improvement and {{consolidation of the}} gun cotton Trinitrocellulose. He tried to use the guncotton as blowing agent for guns. Therefore, the “K. K. Ärarische Schießwollanstalt” in Hirtenberg, a predecessor of today existing arms factory Hirtenberger AG, was established in 1851. The later Feldzeugmeister succeeded in generating a Trinitrocellulose C12H7(3NO4)O10, that met the military requirements for durability, uniform combustion with high <b>combustion</b> <b>rate</b> and temperature insensitivity up to an ignition point of 136 °C.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{remaining}} {{difficulty with}} hybrids is with mixing the propellants during the combustion process. In solid propellants, the oxidizer and fuel are mixed {{in a factory}} in carefully controlled conditions. Liquid propellants are generally mixed by the injector {{at the top of}} the combustion chamber, which directs many small swift-moving streams of fuel and oxidizer into one another. Liquid-fueled rocket injector design has been studied at great length and still resists reliable performance prediction. In a hybrid motor, the mixing happens at the melting or evaporating surface of the fuel. The mixing is not a well-controlled process and generally quite a lot of propellant is left unburned, which limits the efficiency of the motor. The <b>combustion</b> <b>rate</b> of the fuel is largely determined by the oxidizer flux and exposed fuel surface area. This <b>combustion</b> <b>rate</b> is not usually sufficient for high power operations such as boost stages unless the surface area or oxidizer flux is high. Too high of oxidizer flux can lead to flooding and loss of flame holding that locally extinguishes the combustion. Surface area can be increased, typically by longer grains or multiple ports, but this can increase combustion chamber size, reduce grain strength and/or reduce volumetric loading. Additionally, as the burn continues, the hole down the center of the grain (the 'port') widens and the mixture ratio tends to become more oxidizer rich.|$|E
40|$|The {{combustion}} {{mechanism of}} a shredded tobacco bed during puffing has been investigated. To evaluate {{changes in the}} burning rate of the shredded tobacco bed in the region close to the paper char-line, an experimental study was carried out on the reverse combustion of the shredded tobacco bed packed in a furnace. Measurements of {{the temperature in the}} shredded tobacco bed were conducted to calculate the <b>combustion</b> propagation <b>rate.</b> The <b>combustion</b> propagation <b>rate</b> decreased with an increase in the tobacco shred width, the tobacco packing density, and with a decrease in the air flow velocity. To investigate differences in the <b>combustion</b> propagation <b>rate,</b> the oxygen transfer coefficient of the shredded tobacco bed was evaluated using the effective diameter of the tobacco shred and the effective surface area of the shredded tobacco bed. The <b>combustion</b> propagation <b>rate</b> of the shredded tobacco bed increased with the oxygen transfer coefficient of the shredded tobacco bed. Furthermore, the weight loss of the cigarette during puffing was evaluated. The weight loss of the cigarette during puffing showed an increase with an increase in the oxygen transfer coefficient of the shredded tobacco bed...|$|R
40|$|Detonation {{waves are}} {{supersonic}} combustion waves {{that have a}} multi-shock front structure followed by a spatially non-uniform reaction zone. During propagation, a de-coupled shock-flame complex is periodically re-initiated into an overdriven detonation following a transient Mach reflection process. Past researchers have identified mechanisms that can increase <b>combustion</b> <b>rates</b> and cause localized hot spot re-ignition behind the Mach shock. But due to the small length scales and stochastic behaviour of detonation waves, the important mechanisms {{that can lead to}} re-initiation into a detonation requires further clarification. If a detonation is allowed to diffract behind an obstacle, it can quench to form a de-coupled shock-flame complex and if allowed to form a Mach reflection, re-initiation of a detonation can occur. The use of this approach permits the study of re-initiation mechanisms reproducibly with relatively large length scales. The objective {{of this study is to}} experimentally elucidate the key mechanisms that can increase chemical reaction rates and sequentially lead to re-initiation of a de-coupled shock-flame complex into an overdriven detonation wave following a Mach reflection. All experiments were carried out in a thin rectangular channel using a stoichiometric mixture of oxy-methane. Three different types of obstacles were used - a half-cylinder, a roughness plate along with the half-cylinder and a full-cylinder. Schlieren visualization was achieved by using a Z-configuration setup, a high speed camera and a high intensity light source. Results indicate that forward jetting of the slip line behind the Mach stem can potentially increase <b>combustion</b> <b>rates</b> by entraining hot burned gas into unburned gas. Following ignition and jet entrainment, a detonation wave first appears along the Mach stem. The transverse wave can form a detonation wave due to rapid combustion of unburned gas which may be attributed to shock interaction with the unburned gas. Alternatively, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability can produce vortices along the slipline that may lead to mixing between burned-unburned gases and potentially increase <b>combustion</b> <b>rates</b> near the transverse wave. However, the mechanism(s) that causes the transverse wave to re-initiate into a detonation wave remains to be satisfactorily resolved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} possible practical {{answer to}} so-called challenge of turbulent combustion (i. e. inability of combustion models predict accurately at real Reynolds and Damkohler numbers <b>combustion</b> <b>rates)</b> using Kolmogorov idea of equilibrium small-scale states. As this challenge {{is connected with}} inability to resolve at combustion modeling small space and time scales where takes place coupling between chemistry and turbulence, controlling the rates, our propose is based on assumption some equilibrium small-scale structures of reaction zones at flamelet combustion mechanism, whose properties could be {{expressed in terms of}} large-scale parameters. In other words the <b>combustion</b> <b>rates</b> enter in the combustion equation through a physical model similar to the molecular dissipation in the Kolmogorov "k - ε" turbulence model. The concrete analyzed premixed combustion problem refers to the case of strong turbulence and flames with increasing brush width (this combustion regime is preceded to the traditional stationary flames). Two main equilibrium states are assumed for quantitative description of this coupling: equilibrium fine-scale turbulence, which controls thickened flamelet parameters and equilibrium small-scale structure of strongly wrinkled amelet sheet that controls the flamelet area. We examined integral turbulent ame speed Ut and the local <b>combustion</b> <b>rates</b> across the flame ρW. It has been shown that at the same Ut, the possibility of accurate prediction of the ρW distribution is closely connected with the possibility to describe the counter-gradient transport phenomenon. Finally we generalize the premixed combustion model equation in terms of the progress variable to the general case of partially premixed combustion. These more general equations are in terms of PDF of a passive concentration and a conditional progress variable, the transport terms are controlled only by physical gradient diffusion, equations contain only the dissipation of the passive concentration. At equilibrium products (fast chemistry) the coupling between chemistry and turbulence is described similar to the premixed case by a model source term. All coupling effects contains only in the equation in the terms of the conditional progress variable and enter in the source term through the physical model...|$|R

A piston press is used to create solid briquettes for {{a wide array of}} purposes. Screw extrusion is used to compact biomass into loose, homogeneous briquettes that are substituted for coal in cofiring. This technology creates a toroidal, or doughnut-like, briquette.

5000|$|For {{microscale}} particles, as {{particle size}} decreases {{and the specific}} surface area increases, the explosion severity increases. However, for dusts of organic materials such as coal, flour, methylcellulose, and polyethylene, severity ceases to increase as the particle size is reduced below ∼50 μm. This is because decreasing particle size primarily increases the volatilization rate, which becomes rapid enough that that gas phase combustion becomes the rate limiting step, and further decrease in particle size will not increase the overall <b>combustion</b> <b>rate.</b> [...] While the minimum explosion concentration does not vary significantly with nanoparticle size, the minimum ignition energy and temperature {{have been found to}} decrease with particle size.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the proper}} and the {{optimized}} heat transfer from the flue gases to the boiler tubes draft holds {{a relatively high}} amount of significance. The <b>combustion</b> <b>rate</b> of the flue gases {{and the amount of}} heat transfer to the boiler are both dependent on the movement and motion of the flue gases. A boiler equipped with a combustion chamber which has a strong current of air (draft) through the fuel bed will increase the rate of combustion ( [...] which is the efficient utilization of fuel with minimum waste of unused fuel). The stronger movement will also increase the heat transfer rate from the flue gases to the boiler (which improves efficiency and circulation).|$|E
40|$|Effects of CeO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 on {{combustion}} {{reactivity of}} several fuels, including three ranks of coals, graphite and anthracite chars, were investigated using thermo-gravimetric analyzer. The {{results indicated that}} the combustion reactivity of all the samples except lignite was improved with CeO 2 or Fe 2 O 3 addition. It was {{interesting to note that the}} ignition temperatures of anthracite were decreased by 50 degrees C and 53 degrees C, respectively, with CeO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 addition and that its <b>combustion</b> <b>rates</b> were increased to 15. 4 %/min and 12. 2 %/min. Ignition temperatures of lignite with CeO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 addition were 250 degrees C and 226 degrees C, and the <b>combustion</b> <b>rates</b> were 12. 8 % and 19. 3 %/min, respectively. When compared with those of lignite without catalysts, no obvious catalytic effects of the two catalysts on its combustion reactivity were revealed. The results from the combustion of the three rank pulverized coals catalyzed by CeO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 indicated significant effects of the two catalysts on fixed carbon combustion. And it was found that the higher the fuel rank, the better the catalytic effect. The results of combustion from two kinds of anthracite chars showed obvious effects of anthracite pyrolysis catalyzed by CeO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 on its combustion reactivity.

40|$|The {{self-sustained}} {{thermite reaction}} between iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3) and aluminum is a classical source of energy. In this work the radial combustion propagation on thin circular samples of stoichiometric and over aluminized Fe 2 O 3 /Al thermite mixtures is studied. The radial geometry allows an easy detection of sample heterogeneities and {{the observation of}} the combustion behavior in their vicinity. The influence of factors like reactant mixtures stoichiometry, samples green density and system geometry on the rate of propagation of the combustion front is analyzed. The radial combustion front profiles are registered by digital video-crono-photography. Combustion thermograms are obtained for two sample radii. Theoretical calculations, based on the impurity levels reported by the reactants manufacturers and on the thermite reaction stoichiometry, were used to define the stoichiometric mixture with unitary equivalence ratio (E.  R.). However, it was found from the experimental results that the excess of aluminum only starts for E.  R. values between 1. 12 and 1. 27. This was explained by the further oxidation of aluminum during storage and/or by the reaction incompleteness. In the range studied, the <b>combustion</b> <b>rates</b> of the thermite mixtures did not show any significant dependence on the green density. <b>Combustion</b> <b>rates</b> obtained in this work were slightly higher than those obtained in an earlier work for long square channel geometry.

5000|$|To {{keep the}} <b>combustion</b> <b>rate</b> {{of the fuel}} constant, the {{pressure}} and temperature in the engine must also be constant. This is problematic because the airflow control systems that would facilitate this are not physically possible in a scramjet launch vehicle due to the large speed and altitude range involved, meaning that it must travel at an altitude specific to its speed. Because air density reduces at higher altitudes, a scramjet must climb at a specific rate as it accelerates to maintain a constant air pressure at the intake. This optimal climb/descent profile is called a [...] "constant dynamic pressure path". It is thought that scramjets might be operable up to an altitude of 75 km.|$|E

By the mid-1950s, NAA had a version known as the XLR-43 running at [...] thrust, while further reducing weight at the same time.

50|$|The {{propellant}} {{particle size}} distribution has {{a profound impact on}} APCP rocket motor performance. Smaller AP and Al particles lead to higher combustion efficiency but also lead to increased linear burn rate. The burn rate is heavily dependent on mean AP particle size as the AP absorbs heat to decompose into a gas before it can oxidize the fuel components. This process may be a rate-limiting step in the overall <b>combustion</b> <b>rate</b> of APCP. The phenomenon can be explained by considering the heat flux to mass ratio: As the particle radius increases the volume (and, therefore, mass and heat capacity) increase as the cube of the radius. However, the surface area increases as the square of the radius, which is roughly proportional to the heat flux into the particle. Therefore, a particle's rate of temperature rise is maximized when the particle size is minimized.|$|E

50|$|In {{a typical}} ICE, {{combustion}} occurs via a flame. Hence {{at any point}} in time, {{only a fraction of the}} total fuel is burning. This results in low peak pressures and low energy release rates. In HCCI however, the entire fuel/air mixture ignites and burns over a much smaller time interval, resulting in high peak pressures and high energy release rates. To withstand the higher pressures, the engine has to be structurally stronger. Several strategies have been proposed to lower the <b>rate</b> of <b>combustion</b> and peak pressure. Mixing fuels, with different autoignition properties, can lower the combustion speed.However, this requires significant infrastructure to implement. Another approach uses dilution (i.e. with exhaust gases) to reduce the pressure and <b>combustion</b> <b>rates</b> (and output).|$|R
5000|$|In chemistry, {{the burn}} rate (or burning rate) {{is a measure}} of the linear <b>combustion</b> <b>rate</b> of a {{compound}} or substance such as a candle or a solid propellant. It is measured in length over time, such as [...] "mm/second" [...] or [...] "inches/second". Among the variables affecting burn rate are pressure and temperature. Burn rate is an important parameter especially in the area of propellants because it determines the rate at which exhaust gases are generated from the burning propellant which in turn decides the rate of flow through the nozzle. The thrust generated in the rocket of missile depends on this rate of flow. Thus Knowing quantitatively the burning rate of a propellant, and how it changes under various conditions, is of fundamental importance in the successful design of a solid rocket motor. The concept of Burning rate is also relevant in case of liquid propellants.|$|E
50|$|The {{temperature}} of the gas in the engine is highest just before the turbine, and the ability for the turbine to withstand these temperatures {{is one of the}} primary restrictions on total dry engine thrust. This temperature is known as the Turbine Entry Temperature (TET), one of the critical engine operating parameters. Because a <b>combustion</b> <b>rate</b> high enough to consume all the intake oxygen would create temperatures high enough to overheat the turbine, the flow of fuel must be restricted to an extent that fuel rather than oxygen becomes the limiting factor in the reaction, leaving some oxygen to flow past the turbine. After passing the turbine, the gas expands at a near constant entropy, thus losing temperature. The afterburner then injects fuel downstream of the turbine and reheats the gas. In conjunction with the added heat, the pressure rises in the tailpipe and the gas is ejected through the nozzle at a higher velocity. The mass flow is also slightly increased by the addition of the fuel.|$|E
5000|$|Hazardous waste may be [...] "destroyed". For example, by incinerating it {{at a high}} temperature, {{flammable}} wastes {{can sometimes}} be burned as energy sources. For example, many cement kilns burn hazardous wastes like used oils or solvents. Today, incineration treatments not only {{reduce the amount of}} hazardous waste, but also generate energy from the gases released in the process. It is known that this particular waste treatment releases toxic gases produced by the combustion of byproduct or other materials which can affect the environment. However, current technology has developed more efficient incinerator units that control these emissions to a point where this treatment is considered a more beneficial option. There are different types of incinerators which vary depending on the characteristics of the waste. Starved air incineration is another method used to treat hazardous wastes. Just like in common incineration, burning occurs, however controlling the amount of oxygen allowed proves to be significant {{to reduce the amount of}} harmful byproducts produced. Starved air incineration is an improvement of the traditional incinerators in terms of air pollution. Using this technology, it is possible to control the <b>combustion</b> <b>rate</b> of the waste and therefore reduce the air pollutants produced in the process.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 A {{program of}} {{research}} has been established at Oregon State University to study wood residue combustion using an experimental spreader-stoker combustor. This research was conducted to increase the understanding of combustion occurring in wood fired boilers. Using Douglas Fir screened to 3 / 8 - 3 / 4 inches, two 4 x 4 factorial experiments were conducted varying depth of fuel bed and fuel feed rate. The objective of the experiments was to test the hypotheses that increased fuel bed depth has the statistically significant effects of decreasing particulate emissions and increasing the relative amount of solid carbon oxidized by the underfire air (the Relative Carbon Saturation). The amount of carbon is relative to the maximum amount that could be oxidized by the air. The results of the experiments were that the following effects {{were found to be}} statistically significant. 1. Increasing fuel bed depth from two to four inches decreases particulate emissions. 2. The effect of bed depth on particulate emissions is more pronounced at higher <b>combustion</b> <b>rates.</b> 3. Increasing fuel bed depth from two to four inches increases the Relative Carbon Saturation of the gases produced in the fuel bed. 4.
