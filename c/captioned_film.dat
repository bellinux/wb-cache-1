Non-randomised pretest posttest design was adopted. To achieve the objectives of the study therefore 37 SS I economics students in Special School in Uyo Local Government Area were used as the sample for the study. The subjects were divided into experimental and control groups. Experimental group were treated with instructional <b>captioned</b> <b>film</b> while control group were treated with conventional sign method. Economics Performance Test (EPT) was used for data collection. Two research questions and two hypotheses were formulated and tested using the Analysis of Covariance at 0. 05 significant level. The result revealed that there is an overall significant difference of hearing impaired students academic performance when taught with the use Instructional <b>Captioned</b> <b>Film</b> and those taught using conventional sign method. It was also revealed that gender does not significantly influence academic performance of hearing impaired economics students. The study therefore recommended the use of Instructional <b>Captioned</b> <b>Film</b> for teaching the hearing impaired student...|$|E

Captioning for the deaf is still young, is still growing, and I think it is constantly being improved. We still have much to learn, and I hope we are never completely satisfied with our research or our end products. I simply hope we never stop learning. This coming September will mark the 20 th anniversary of Public Law 85 - 905, which established the <b>Captioned</b> <b>Films</b> for the Deaf program and the beginning of the art of captioning for the deaf. It is also considered the beginning of the use of instructional technology in the education of the deaf. The consequence of this legislation has been the design of educational materials to meet the unique learning needs of the deaf and a strong interest in exploring ways to either adapt or to develop new technology to assist in the efforts to more fully guarantee deaf persons their full rights in society. I would like to give you a review of past developments which quickly tell us how far we have come. In addition to a nationwide distribution system which makes <b>captioned</b> <b>films</b> available for deaf persons of all ages, there is an evaluation and selection system to determine which films, educational or theatrical, are annually added to the program; educators of the deaf have earned advanced degrees in instructional technology...|$|R

40|$|THESILENT FILMS OF THE EARLY 1900 s {{had a huge}} audience, {{hearing and}} deaf, for public {{entertainment}} and instruction. The advent of “talkies, ” however, excluded deaf people from this means of access to mainstream American culture.

5000|$|The NAD {{advocates for}} any {{issues that are}} {{associated}} with deaf rights. It early worked to preserve sign language, especially under George Veditz. During his time as president, Veditz {{and other members of the}} NAD used the new film technology to capture individuals signing so that their language would never be lost. Although African-Americans were not permitted to be members until later, starting in the early 1900s, the NAD advocated for vocational training for the [...] "Colored Deaf" [...] population. Because of the lack of rights afforded to blacks in NAD, several groups were formed, included National Black Deaf Advocates. The NAD has also fought to keep deaf teachers for teaching deaf students and for the opening of deaf residential schools across the country. In 1909, President William Howard Taft signed a law allowing deaf individuals to take civil service exams only after the NAD fought to have this as a law. It was a strong advocate for having <b>captioned</b> <b>films</b> and in 1958, President Dwight Eisenhower signed a law requiring it.|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the current state}} of closed captioning for online videos, in the U. S. context.

Drawing on the history of television closed <b>captioning</b> and theatrical <b>film</b> <b>captioning,</b> it argues that captions and deafness have long been associated with the private, complicating their advancement under civil rights laws concerned with the public sphere and facilitating advancement through telecommunications laws and notions of consumer choice. This article cautions that such neoliberal solutions cannot be relied on to meet the needs—and civil rights—of deaf and hard-of-hearing Americans, and might in fact damage the coalitional identity politics on which civil rights for people with disabilities depend, unless such politics can be reinvigorated through emphasis on unification around shared goals...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} {{educational}} technology predates {{the invention of}} the term by a considerable period of time. From a historical perspective, technology applied to education must be seen in reference to the available technology of the society and the times of which we speak. When Moses brought the Ten Commandments from the mountain engraved in stone, there is no question but that it carried a greater impact than if it had been hand-lettered on Papyrus or whatever alternatives existed. One might say that engraving the Ten Commandments in stone added an appropriate kinesthetic dimension to such a weighty message, and it didn‟t discriminate against the deaf and blind. However, you can be sure that, had the technology been available, Moses would have recorded the voice of God on Memorex audiotape and played it back full volume on a stereo system with appropriate psychedelic lighting. To pursue ancient history a bit longer, we hardly need to point out the massive effect of printing technology in the dissemination of knowledge and God‟s Commandments. Printing, we might say, has been and still is the backbone technology of the world‟s various educational systems. The dawn of educational technology for the hearing impaired is generally regarded to be the year of 1958 when P. L. 85 - 905 established <b>Captioned</b> <b>Films</b> for the Deaf. In terms of modern communication technology, particularly electronics, this is as good a starting point as any, although there are educator...|$|R
