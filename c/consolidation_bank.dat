40|$|Although recent {{experiences}} {{made during}} the ongoing international financial crisis call for smaller entities in banking systems, consolidation still takes place in many industrialized economies. The often stretched argument that large banks are able to establish economies of scale as well as econo-mies of scope, ignores at least the risks of financial intermediaries becoming ‘too big to fail’ or ‘too interconnected to fail’. Our analysis presents reliable evidence that even the assumption that big banks are less inefficient than small ones is far away from being convincing. We apply a range of indicators to test for both performance and risk taking capability of banks in different financial sys-tems. Our findings suggest empirical merits of diversified banking systems and higher systemic risk for financial industries dominated by global players. <b>consolidation,</b> <b>bank</b> performance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} increased consolidation in banking and monetary policy transmission in eighteen Asian and Latin American economies, using bank-level data from 1996 to 2006. Our results provide consistent evidence that as concentration in banking increases, the bank lending channel is weakened, leading the {{monetary policy transmission mechanism}} to be less effective. We also investigate how this relationship between concentration and the strength of the lending channel depends on bank-specific characteristics. Using bank-level balance sheet and income statement data allows us, first, to better identify the effects of banking consolidation on the supply-side bank lending channel from those of the demand-side interest rate channel, and second, to test for any systematic differences in the impact of consolidation on monetary policy transmission across banks of different size and financial strength. We also discuss potential explanations for and policy implications of the main findings of this paper. Banking <b>consolidation</b> <b>Bank</b> lending channel Monetary policy transmission...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The banking reform {{pronounced}} on the 6 th of July, 2004 {{had been}} a major wave towards a diversified, strong and reliable banking sector in Nigeria. This paper examined the mega banks by evaluating their performance {{four years after the}} consolidation exercise in Nigeria. It examined the impact of consolidation on performance and considers if there had been considerable improvement on their profitability, liquidity and solvency. In this study, we analyzed the performance ratio of a sample of thirteen (13) mega banks. A descriptive analysis of these performance ratios was carried out. Correlation Analysis was used to test the impact of the consolidation on the performance measurement parameters. We found that, on average, bank consolidation resulted into improved performance. The paper therefore suggests that the bank management should embrace broad product strategies, which could help in generating more income for the banks. They should also embrace diversification and financial innovation in order to produce new products and services.

40|$|Bank {{consolidation}} {{has been}} going on for more than a decade, in part the result of legislative and regulatory changes and in part a reflection of the large number of banks that became financially troubled in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. However, the rapid consolidation of institutions still continues, even though the health of most banks has improved and many states long ago liberalized regulations on intrastate branching and interstate merging. This suggests that other factors may also be playing an important role. The large number of mergers involving target banks with assets under $ 100 million and the preponderance of mergers where both target and acquirer are small banks suggest that some of the merger activity may be an attempt to overcome limitations imposed by small size, such as borrower concentration limits. The fastest-growing segment of the lending market is loans over $ 1 million, and borrower concentration limits prevent the smallest banks from servicing such loans.

The paper concludes that the establishment of Czech Consolidation Agency (Czech <b>Consolidation</b> <b>Bank,</b> respectively) was the least suitable approach {{to dealing with}} problematic assets in the Czech banking sector during the period of the transformation. The paper furthermore suggests that other methods, such as the liquidation accompanied with deposit insurance payments, publicly assisted mergers and acquisitions, or finally privately or publicly assisted purchase and assumption transactions should have been used instead.

40|$|Purpose – Governments of many {{developed}} and developing countries have designed and implemented various financial reforms to enable the sector {{to play the role}} of efficient financial intermediation, thereby helping to bolster economic growth and development. The purpose of this paper is to survey past and present literature on the chronology of banking reforms in Nigeria and the implications of the last reform on the Nigerian economy. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is analytical with mode of presentation based on content analysis. Findings – The paper posits that the banking system in Nigeria has come a long way in term of regulations and reforms, number of institutions, structure of ownership, and depth and breadth of operations. However, the various reforms have not yet achieved the desired objectives, either due to poor implementation or improper institutional arrangement or sometimes due to abrupt termination of the reforms. Originality/value – The paper suggests that henceforth, reforms should be designed according to the peculiarities of the Nigerian economy and institutional behaviour, and should be backed by adequate legislation.

40|$|For {{nearly two}} decades banks in the United States have {{consolidated}} in record numbers [...] {{in terms of both}} frequency {{and the size of the}} merging institutions. Rhoades (1996) hypothesizes that the main motivators were increased potential for geographic expansion created by changes in state laws regulating branching and a more favorable antitrust climate. To look for evidence of economic incentives to exploit these improved opportunities for consolidation, the authors examine how consolidation affects expected profit, the riskiness of profit, profit efficiency, market value, market-value efficiencies, and the risk of insolvency. Their estimates of expected profit, profit risk, and profit efficiency are based on a structural model of leveraged portfolio production that was estimated for a sample of highest-level U. S. bank holding companies in Hughes, Lang, Mester, and Moon (1996). Here, the authors also estimate two additional measures that gauge efficiency in terms of the market values of assets and of equity. Their findings suggest that the economic benefits of consolidation are strongest for those banks engaged in interstate expansion and, in particular, interstate expansion that diversifies banks' macroeconomic risk.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} the great divide {{in the level}} of financial development between the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) 7 countries and the more advanced economies in transition, in particular those of Central and Eastern Europe and Baltic states. It discusses the roots of financial underdevelopment in the CIS- 7 countries by examining the differentials in interest rate spreads between the CIS- 7 countries and the transition economies that have achieved faster financial development. The roots of the divide are traced to weaknesses in the institutional infrastructure for financial intermediation, which lead to a combination of low depositor trust in the banking system and high credit risk. High credit risk stems mainly from the poor creditor-rights protection and weak auditing and accounting standards. Financial sector reform strategies that fail to give priority to the resolution of weaknesses in the basic financial infrastructure are unlikely to be successful in letting the CIS- 7 countries bridge the great divide.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} a banking industry with heterogeneous banks that delivers predictions on the relationship between banks'' risk of failure, market structure, bank ownership, and banks'' screening and bankruptcy costs. These predictions are explored empirically using a panel of individual banks data and ownership information including more than 10, 000 bank-year observations for 133 non-industrialized countries during the 1993 - 2004 period. Four main results obtain. First, the positive and significant relationship between bank concentration and bank risk of failure found in Boyd, De NicolÃ² and Al Jalal (2006) is stronger when bank ownership is taken into account, and it is strongest when state-owned banks have sizeable market shares. Second, conditional on country and firm specific characteristics, the risk profiles of foreign (state-owned) banks are significantly higher than (not significantly different from) those of private domestic banks. Third, private domestic banks do take on more risk as a result of larger market shares of both state-owned and foreign banks. Fourth, the model rationalizes this evidence if both state-owned and foreign banks have either larger screening and/or lower bankruptcy costs than private domestic banks, banks'' differences in market shares, screening or bankruptcy costs are not too large, and loan markets are sufficiently segmented across banks of different ownership.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of fiscal policy {{response}} in 118 episodes of systemic banking crisis in advanced and emerging market countries during 1980 - 2008. It finds that timely countercyclical fiscal measures contribute to shortening the length of crisis episodes by stimulating aggregate demand. Fiscal expansions that rely mostly on measures to support government consumption are more effective in shortening the crisis duration than those based on public investment or income tax cuts. But these results do not hold for countries with limited fiscal space where fiscal expansions are prevented by funding constraints. The composition of countercyclical fiscal responses matters as well for output recovery after the crisis, with public investment yielding the strongest impact on growth. These results suggest a potential trade-off between short-run aggregate demand support and medium-term productivity growth objectives in fiscal stimulus packages adopted in distress times.

It was confirmed that policy-promoted consolidations mitigated the financial crisis by enhancing the ability of the bank to collect deposits, under the condition that the financial system was exposed to serious negative shocks. On the other hand, policy-promoted consolidations had negative aspects. They were accompanied by large organizational costs, and decreased bank profitability. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to review the obstacles to cross-border integration and <b>consolidation,</b> which confront <b>banks</b> operating within the EU. Theoretical and empirical evidence supports the view that integration and <b>consolidation</b> in the <b>banking</b> sector can enhance overall economic performance via macroeconomic stabilisation, higher levels of efficiency and consumer welfare. While in recent years only slow progress has been recorded in EU cross-border banking integration, a substantial consolidation in the Member State's national banking sectors has occurred leading to rising domestic concentration ratios implying greater efficiency but potentially limiting welfare gains. The lack of progress in cross-border integration can be attributed to various factors, including national differences in market practices, regulation and taxation. A fairly comprehensive list of existing obstacles is provided and their impact on the main avenues for cross-border banking integration is examined, namely on (i) organic growth in the form of foreign branches and subsidiaries, (ii) cross-border mergers and acquisitions and (iii) cross-border provision of banking services. In addition, the role of institutional factors relating to the framework for prudential supervision is considered, notably in the context of the relationship of home and host country supervisors with each other and with market participants. While the highlighted issues are of general relevance in the context of EU financial integration, they might be of special significance in the context of the recently acceded Member States and their largely foreign owned banking system.
