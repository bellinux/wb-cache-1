Etiological factors mainly included epilepsy in 54 cases, intracranial infection in 49 cases, and complex febrile seizure in 44 cases.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} Interictal Electroencephalographic (EEG) changes in different types of Seizures. Methods: The study covers 80 patients with generalized seizures and partial seizures. The patients were from the neurology out patient department of Little Flower Hospital, Angamaly. Forty-eight cases out of eighty were males and thirty two were females. Selection and clinical definitions of the cases were based on a positive correlation of the following two parameters. 1. Clinical features of seizures. 2. Generalization of prevalent interictal EEG activity. Out of 80 cases; 60 cases were clinically diagnosed as having generalized seizures, It includes 42 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> Generalized Tonic-Clonic seizures; 8 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> absence seizures; 5 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy 2 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> infantile spasms and 3 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> alcoholic withdrawal seizures. 20 cases showed partial seizures; it includes 18 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> simple partial seizures and 2 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> complex partial seizures.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} swallowing training combined with low-frequency electrical stimulation on dysphagia after ischemic stroke.   Methods A total of 68 patients with dysphagia after ischemic stroke were divided into control group (N = 34, receiving swallowing training and feeding strategies) and combined treatment group (N = 34, receiving swallowing training, feeding strategies and low-frequency electrical stimulation). Video Fluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS) and Standardized Swallowing Assessment (SSA) were {{used to evaluate the}} swallowing function of patients in 2 groups before and after 15 d of treatment. Results According to Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project (OCSP) classification, 34 patients in control group were classified into 12 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> total anterior circulation infarct (TACI), 8 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> partial anterior circulation infarct (PACI), 10 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> posterior circulation infarct (POCI) and 4 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> lacunar infarct (LACI); 34 patients in combined treatment group were classified into 10 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> TACI, 7 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> PACI, 11 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> POCI and 6 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> LACI. Compared with before treatment, the VFSS score increased (P = 0. 003, 0. 000), while SSA score decreased (P = 0. 003, 0. 000) in both groups. Compared with control group, the VFSS score increased (P = 0. 004), while SSA score decreased (P = 0. 020) in combined treatment group.   Conclusions Swallowing training combined with low-frequency electrical stimulation can significantly improve the swallowing capacity of patients with acute ischemic stroke, and the effect is better than mere swallowing training.   DOI: 10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2015. 04. 007 </p...|$|R
