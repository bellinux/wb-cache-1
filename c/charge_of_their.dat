5|$|Celtic manager Jock Stein {{was then}} {{appointed}} manager of Scotland on a part-time basis. Stein took <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> attempt {{to qualify for}} the 1966 World Cup. Scotland achieved good results in their first two qualifiers, a draw against Poland and a win against Finland. Stein was criticised by the Scottish press after the team conceded two late goals and lost 2–1 at home to Poland, but they managed to beat Italy 1–0 at Hampden Park to raise some hope of qualification. Scotland suffered from several players withdrawing from the return match against Italy due to injury and a 3–0 defeat meant that they failed to qualify. Clyde manager John Prentice then took the job on a full-time basis in 1966, but left to manage Dundee after just six months and four games in charge.|$|E

5|$|Himmler met {{his future}} wife, Margarete Boden, in 1927. Seven years his senior, {{she was a}} nurse who shared his {{interest}} in herbal medicine and homoeopathy, and was part owner of a small private clinic. They were married in July 1928, and their only child, Gudrun, was born on 8 August 1929. The couple were also foster parents to a boy named Gerhard von Ahe, son of an SS officer who had died before the war. Margarete sold her share of the clinic and used the proceeds to buy a plot of land in Waldtrudering, near Munich, where they erected a prefabricated house. Himmler was constantly away on party business, so his wife took <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> efforts—mostly unsuccessful—to raise livestock for sale. They had a dog, Töhle.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{approach is to}} use solvatochromic dyes, which change their properties (intensity, half-life, and excitation, and emission spectra), depending on the polarity and <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> environments. Hence, they are sometimes loosely referred to as environmentally sensitive dyes. These can be positioned on specific residues that either change their spatial arrangement due to a conformational change induced by glucose or reside in the glucose-binding pocket whereby the displacement of the water present by glucose decreases the polarity.|$|E
25|$|Her plots are {{fundamentally}} about education; her heroines {{come to see}} themselves and their conduct more clearly, and become better, more moral people. While Austen steers clear of the formal moralizing common in early-19th-century literature, morality—characterized by manners, duty to society and religious seriousness—is a central theme of her works. Throughout her novels, serious reading is associated with intellectual and moral development. The {{extent to which the}} novels reflect feminist themes has been extensively debated by scholars; most critics agree that the novels highlight how some female characters take <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own worlds, while others are confined, physically and spiritually. Almost all Austen's works explore the precarious economic situation in which women of the late-18th and early-19th centuries found themselves.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{reliability}} of electrostatically actuated RF MEMS switches is reviewed {{with emphasis on}} recent advancements. Both ohmic and capacitive switches have been operated for more 100 -billion cycles without failure. When they do fail, ohmic switches tend to fail catastrophically by stiction, whereas capacitive switches often degrade gradually through <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> dielectric insulators. Approaches to mitigate and model dielectric charging are then presented. Index Terms — Charge injection, contacts, dielectric films, dielectric materials, microelectromechanical devices...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a solution for}} the distributed dynamic assignment {{of a set of}} electric vehicles to a network <b>of</b> <b>charging</b> stations. The drivers of the vehicles send requests for the <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own vehicle; then they receive the location of the station to reach for the battery charging. The problem is solved using some distributed multi-agent assignment algorithms: the stations reach a consensus solving some local integer linear programming problems. Moreover, the convergence of the algorithms is proved and an example shows the efficiency of the proposed solution. © 2014 EUCA...|$|R
25|$|Youth {{empowerment}} is {{a process}} where {{children and young people}} are encouraged to take <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lives. They do this by addressing their situation and then take action in order to improve their access to resources and transform their consciousness through their beliefs, values, and attitudes. Youth empowerment aims to improve quality of life. Youth empowerment is achieved through participation in youth empowerment programs. However scholars argue that children’s rights implementation should go beyond learning about formal rights and procedures to give birth to a concrete experience of rights. There are numerous models that youth empowerment programs use that help youth achieve empowerment. A variety of youth empowerment initiatives are underway around the world. These programs can be through non-profit organizations, government organizations, schools or private organizations.|$|E
25|$|His father (1893–1959), a {{successful}} local surgeon born in Fontainebleau, moved to Poitiers, where {{he set up}} his own practice and married local woman Anne Malapert. She {{was the daughter of}} prosperous surgeon Dr. Prosper Malapert, who owned a private practice and taught anatomy at the University of Poitiers' School of Medicine. Paul Foucault eventually took over his father-in-law's medical practice, while his wife took <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> large mid-19th-century house, Le Piroir, in the village of Vendeuvre-du-Poitou. Together the couple had three children – a girl named Francine and two boys, Paul-Michel and Denys – who all shared the same fair hair and bright blue eyes. The children were raised to be nominal Roman Catholics, attending mass at the Church of Saint-Porchair, and while Michel briefly became an altar boy, none of the family were devout.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{energy release}} per atom is about 180 million electron volts (MeV); i.e., 74 TJ/kg. Only 7% {{of this is}} gamma radiation and kinetic energy of fission neutrons. The remaining 93% is kinetic energy (or energy of motion) of the charged fission fragments, flying {{away from each other}} mutually repelled by the positive <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> protons (38 for strontium, 54 for xenon). This initial kinetic energy is 67 TJ/kg, imparting an initial speed of about 12,000 kilometers per second. The charged fragments' high electric charge causes many inelastic collisions with nearby atoms, and these fragments remain trapped inside the bomb's uranium pit and tamper until their motion is converted into heat. This takes about a millionth of a second (a microsecond), by which time the core and tamper of the bomb have expanded to plasma several meters in diameter with a temperature of tens of millions of degrees Celsius.|$|E

Scotland suffered from several players withdrawing from the return match against Italy due to injury. Stein, by instinct an attacking coach, set his team up defensively. A 3–0 defeat meant that they failed to qualify from UEFA Group 8. Stein relinquished the Scotland job after this defeat to concentrate on his full-time role with Celtic.|$|E
25|$|Cardinal: The {{cardinal}} {{signs are}} Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn. A native with mainly cardinal signs will {{not want to}} be held under anybody's thumb, and will need to take <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own world. Their attention may be concerned with themselves or others, but wherever their energies are directed it is difficult to deflect them from their chosen course. Cardinal signs in a chart will add courage, initiative and self-motivation. Cardinal subjects are hard to influence because they generally believe they know best. A subject lacking cardinal signs may feel they are never in control of their own lives, but are manipulated by people and circumstances beyond their control. They may lack courage and initiative and may prefer others to make decisions for them. Planets in the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses, and an emphasis on fire and air signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E
25|$|Their illicit trading {{networks}} disrupted, {{the overseas}} traders banded together against the perceived intensification of the Ming anti-pirate campaign.

The Xu brothers had placed Wang Zhi in <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> fleets, finances, and foreign contacts, so Wang did not have much trouble taking over the whole syndicate. He settled on the Gotō Islands of Japan after the Ming made him an outlaw. There he called himself the King of Hui (徽王) and established good relations not only with the local daimyo Matsura Takanobu, but also with regional hegemons like Ōtomo Sōrin and Ōuchi Yoshitaka. Despite his great power, Wang Zhi initially sought to appease the Ming government in hope of getting the maritime prohibitions relaxed, so he turned the rival pirate leaders that he captured over to the authorities. Instead, the Ming authorities tightened the restrictions in 1551, banning even fishing boats from going out to sea. Indignant, Wang Zhi set his pirate fleets upon the Chinese coast.|$|E
