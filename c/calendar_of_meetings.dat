EXECUTIVE SUMMARY I I This year, {{world events}} -including {{the war in}} Iraq, terrorism, and the {{continuing}} decline of financial markets for a third {{year in a row}} (unheard of since the Great Depression) -impacted businesses, nonprofit organizations, and charities worldwide, and the personal lives of us all. I In spite of these dramatic events, members, leaders, and staff rose to the occasion to ensure Quota International's success. Quick action was taken to avert a financial crisis once it became apparent that financial markets would decline for yet another year, eliminating certain activities, I suspending our grants programs, and reducing staff. And members showed their support and commitment for Quota by donating at very generous levels when Quota's need became apparent. I One thing is certain [...] . Quota spirit {{is alive and well in}} all comers of Quota's world. YOU participated in Quota and We Share Foundation programs, activities, services, and contests­including the We Share Foundation's first-ever Quota Cares Month public awareness initiative­I in record numbers. And because of the wonders of technology WE were able to share a record I number of your service successes on our Web sites and in our publications -the most ever. In the year 2000, we featured clubs in 27 articles in our printed publications. In 2002, only two short years later, that number jumped to 74 articles in our printed and Web publications PLUS 62 individual Web stories of amazing Volunteers of the Year you nominated. I Technology also permitted us to share Quota news throughout the year via our revised Quota Home Page launched in October. We were able to report news about Quota's calendar change, I proposed bylaws, board nominees, and other Quota business as decisions were made or news was announced. And throughout this Quota year we have been adding new sections, features, resources, and information to www. guota. org to empower every member and club worldwide. I Our most recent addition, thanks to our Friends of Quota, was a major section "For Clubs" which is the complete source for all Quota and We Share Foundation club programs, services, information, membership tools, administrative procedures and guidelines, and more. In these tenuous times, its comforting to know that a global network of people of different I nationalities, cultures, and backgrounds are united in their desire to work positively towards making our world a better place. I I 1 I I Part I of my report, the Executive Summary, contains highlights of 2002 - 2003 Quota International and We Share Foundation activities. And for those of you who appreciate a more I detailed accounting, please see Part II. On behalf of the staff of Quota International, please know it has been a pleasure serving you, your clubs, and your leaders this past year. I MOVING FORWARD WITH LEADERS AS LISTENERS Since 1995, Quota's award-winning Leaders as Listeners program has served as the guiding force in the organization's strategic decision making. The beauty ofthis program is that it I provides a mechanism for leaders to seek member feedback on important decisions facing the board ofthe directors and voting delegates. I Thanks to the Leaders as Listeners prob'Tam, a major decision was made this year to change the timing of Quota's calendar of annual meetings. Based on positive feedback received from members at Convention 2002, 2002 District Conferences, and leaders who attended 2002 I Governors Seminar, the board of directors voted to change Quota's <b>calendar</b> <b>of</b> <b>meetings.</b> Beginning in 2003, Governors Seminar will now be held in conjunction with the opening of convention and district conferences will be held March through June beginning in 2004 so that I club and district leadership terms coincide. (Districts are welcome to plan an additional, optional "mini" conference in September or October 2003). In addition, the board ofdirectors sent a proposal to the Bylaws Committee recommending a change in the frequency of conventions I effective in 2004. That proposal will be discussed and voted at Convention 2003. EXPANDING QUOTA COMMUNICATIONS I The launching ofQuota's newly revised Quota Home Page in October 2002 was a major event in the organization's recent history. Originally launched in 1998, the updated site contains new features including [...] . I • A marketplace where you can purchase jewelry, order publications, or find out how you can honor someone special. I • A comprehensive section for clubs which contains complete information on programs, services, resources, administrative procedures, and much more for clubs. • A special section just for club presidents which includes important messages, reminders, and announcements. I • Complete information on how you can organize a new club. • Quota's annual calendar -which is continually updated. I • The latest Quota news headlines. • An in-depth history of Quota International including a profile ofFounder Wanda Frey Joiner and the story of Quota's beginnings • Information on how people who care can join Quota. I • More in-depth information about convention including a site to print the current convention program, tour information, hotel and meeting registration forms, and more. I I am proud to report that this new site won the 2003 Communicator's Award of Distinction for exceeding the communication industry'S high standards for excellence. In addition to launching our new and improved Quota Web Site, we updated and improVed our We Share Foundation I Web Site (www. wesharefoundation. org), produced and published four issues of our We Share e­Zine and one issue ofour Quotarian magazine. And of course we have continued our series of e-communications -the Leadership e-Alert, the Quota e-Bulletin, and a new Quota e-News I Update which contains short announcements. 2 I I I I STRENGTHENING QUOTA'S MEMBERSHIP I As of December 31, 2002, Quota International's official membership was 6850 including the members from 4 newly organized clubs. While no new clubs have chartered yet in 2003, several organization efforts are underway. I • RECRUITMENT Members worldwide are committed to Quota recruitment: clubs are recruiting at a healthy 13. 6 % with 934 new members reported as joining in the 2002 calendar year. To encourage I continued recruitment success, Quota operates two annual recruitment challenges that every club can win. Also, we share recruitment successes reported by our clubs; we also welcome every new member and thank and recognize sponsors of every new recruit reported to the QI Office. I Once again this year, Quota sponsored a special membership rewards initiative; new member sponsors received redeemable certificates to apply toward a reduction in their own dues payment in December 2003, or a reduction in their 2003 convention registration when the member(s) they I sponsored during 2002 renewed their membership in January, 2003. This was supported by a generous group ofQuotarians, "Wanda's Team" who are funding this new initiative. I • RETENTION Retention remains one ofthe most important issues facing clubs worldwide. Historically, on average, clubs lose more than half ofthe new members they recruit by the member's fifth year. I Quota's future as an international organization is dependent on the success ofour current and future clubs. Through our Leaders as Listeners program, we learned that there are three important ingredients in every successful club: I • INGREDIENT 1 : Positive attitudes and an encouraging environment -where member needs are met, problems are solved in a positive way, negativity is not condoned, and members enjoy the time they are together. I • INGREDIENT 2 : Stimulating club service and fellowship activities -that can serve as a hook in recruiting new members, improve fundraising, raise the club's local visibility and I increase the satisfaction of existing members through the connection and joy that comes from working and celebrating together. I • INGREDIENT 3 : Ongoing recruitment and "making the ask" to individuals you like and who seek what your club has to offer. I With even one "ingredient" missing, a club is weakened and its long-term viability is in question. Quota International and the We Share Foundation offer resources that can help revitalize clubs, strengthen membership satisfaction, improve recruitment success, and raise your club's visibilityI in your community. These include Quota International's Club Success Guide, the We Share Foundation's Publicity I Pointers public relations kit, and the We Share Foundation's Quota Cares Month Planning Kit. These three tools can be printed from www. guota. org and are recommended for every club's membership toolbox! I I 3 I I CELEBRATING CLUB SUCCESS I Members care deeply about extending Quota's service reach throughout the world. To date, 68 % percent of Quota's clubs have reported their 2002 - 2003 service and fund-raising successes. I INTERNATIONAL SERVICE Together reporting clubs have raised over US$I. 4 million service dollars and spent US$I. 3 million service dollars this past year to improve the lives of people in need. Clubs spent: I US$ 379, 333 on Disadvantaged Women and Children projects US$ 395, 635 on Hearing and Speech projects I US$ 430, 921 on other Community Service US$ 87, 288 on World Service (including the We Share Foundation's Club-to­ClubWorld Service Program) I QUOTASK ISpecial congratulations go to the 78 clubs which reported running the Quota 5 K and raised $ 5, 000 or more service dollars in a single event/special program this year! Just think of the thousands of individual lives that were touched this year simply because Quotarians in 14 countries care. A listing of 5 K winners is located in Tab 5 in the Convention Notebook. I I INVESTING IN QUOTA'S SUCCESS Honoring the diversity within Quota and providing what is most important to major membership constituencies has been well received. This holds true with our voluntary donations programs ­I each of which offers unique benefits that appeal to different groups within Quota's membership. Members have embraced these programs with enthusiasm: US$ 161, 380 was raised this fiscal year alone. In 1996 the average gift per member was US$ 3. 50, this year the average gift of I US$ 23. 56, represents a 500 % increase in giving per member. The beauty of Quota's voluntary donations programs is that they are just that -voluntary. And I every gift helps Quota move forward -in our programs, our development and growth initiatives, and our service expansion. Quota's success mirrors that ofother non-profit organizations which are deriving a larger portion of their annual revenues from non-dues income. I WANDA FREY JOINER FOUNDER FUND/FOUNDER'S PROGRAM Members throughout the world invested in Quota's future by donating US$ 77, 083 to Quota's I Wanda Frey Joiner Development Fund. Special con!,rratulations go to the 18 Founder donors who honored Quota with their $ 1, 000 donation or were honored by other members, clubs, and districts with $ 1, 000 donations during the 2002 - 2003 Quota year. Of those 18 donors, 10 of I them have given multiple donations and 8 of them were brand new Founders. As of May 1, 2003, we have a total of 161 Quotarians, clubs, and districts that have been named WFJ Founders since this initiative began seven years ago and with 3 more who have given since May 1, 2003, I we now have a grand total of 164 donors. I 4 I I ~ I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I WE SHARE BENEFACTORS CIRCLE PROGRAM Launched in 1999, the We Share Benefactors Circle provided funding for We Share Foundation expansion activities including strategic assessment of Quota's international service programs, the development of the Foundation's award-winning Web site, and activities related to expanding Quota's international service visibility and impact. Of these 21 Benefactor donations, 8 of them have given multiple donations and 13 of them were brand new Benefactors. During this time period, US$ 23, 454 in donations were received. Because donations are supporting Quota International's charitable arm, they are tax deductible in the United States. As of May 1, 2003, we have a total of 48 Quotarians and clubs that have been named Benefactors since this initiative began four years ago and with 3 more who have given since May 1, 2003, we now have a grand total of 51 donors. CARING HEARTS CIRCLE The We Share Foundation Caring Hearts Circle invites people everywhere to join a caring circle ofhope that is changing lives. Membership helps the We Share Foundation operate service programs and special projects, award grants for local service initiatives, and offer technical support, education, information, publications, as well as maintenance of the We Share Foundation Web Site. This program raised $ 7225 before the end of Quota's fiscal year. [...] and more has come in since! FRIEND OF QUOTA PROGRAM In its fifth and most successful year, the Friend of Quota Program raised $ 34, 930 for Quota International's general fund 285 Quotarians participated in this year's program. Silver donors ($ 50) and above received special thank-you gifts that include a year's worth of club and leadership publications. A record number of Friends ofQuota gave at the $ 500 level and above this year to support a new web site especially "for clubs" unveiled in April. The Friends of Quota program has been especially popular with past district and international leaders who appreciate being kept up-to-date on the latest club and leadership news worldwide. QUOTA CARING CLUBS At Convention 2002, the We Share Foundation launched a new high donor program for clubs. In its first year, a total of $ 5058 was donated by 19 participating clubs during the 2002 - 2003 Quota year. Three levels of giving are available through this program: the Silver Level ($ 250 -$ 499), the Gold level ($ 500 -$ 999) and Platinum Level (gifts of$I,OOO or more). All participating clubs are honored on the We Share Foundation Web site and in the Convention Notebook. All proceeds support the expansion and improvement of Quota International's charitable arm, the We Share Foundation. 5...|$|E
