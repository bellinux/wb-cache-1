40|$|To {{the extent}} that {{economic}} evaluation of medical technology is frequently antedated by its diffusion, the prospects for "nay saying" {{in the light of}} opportunity costs are limited. This study provides a prospective analysis of the cost of confirmatory testing for a program not yet introduced - use of the faecal occult blood test (FOBT) for colorectal cancer screening. Specifically, it evaluates alternative diagnostic workup strategies - based on existing data on the prevalence of cancers, adenomas and other conditions; the sensitivity and specificity of confirmatory tests (rigid sigmoidoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, double-contrast barium enema and colonoscopy); risks; and net costs to Medicare. Two dominant protocols are identified among the 22 protocols examined. The average cost of one with the best diagnostic yield is conservatively estimated to be $ 174 per FOBT positive individual. Clearly, a <b>cheap</b> <b>screening</b> test does not equate with an inexpensive screening program...|$|E
40|$|Central and Eastern Europe is {{a region}} that is {{expected}} to need more data on the concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the ambient air in the future. Passive air sampling is a <b>cheap</b> <b>screening</b> method for comparison of contamination on various sites or for verification of information obtained by active samplers. Passive air samplers are sensitive enough to mirror even small-scale differences, which makes them capable of monitoring spatial, seasonal, and temporal variations. Different passive air samplers were employed between 1990 and 2013 {{from time to time in}} six Estonian air monitoring stations. The concentrations of PCB and its congeners, HCB, PeCB, HCH, and DDT (the same for PBDE, PCN, PCDD/F) in Estonian ambient air were very low, but they allow tracking transboundary air pollution. The main aim of this article is analysis of changes in the ambient air pollution in Estonia during a long period of time (1990 – 2013).

40|$|The neurotoxin ß-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is {{suspected}} {{to play a}} role in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Because BMAA seems to be produced by cyanobacteria, surface waters are screened for BMAA. However, reliable analysis of BMAA requires specialized and expensive equipment. In 2012, a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for determination of BMAA in surface waters was released. This kit could enable fast and relatively <b>cheap</b> <b>screening</b> of surface waters for BMAA. The objective of this study was to determine whether the BMAA ELISA kit was suitable for the determination of BMAA concentrations in surface waters. We hypothesised that the recovery of spiked samples was close to 100 % and that the results of unspiked sample analysis were comparable between ELISA and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. However, we found that recovery was higher than 100 % in most spiked samples, highest determined recovery was over 400 %. Furthermore, the ELISA gave a positive signal for nearly each tested sample while no BMAA could be detected by LC-MS/MS. We therefore conclude that in its current state, the kit is not suitable for screening surface waters for BMAA...|$|E

Three hundred and fifteen serum samples were systematically sampled from 29 farms and subsequently tested using the Rose Bengal plate test (RBPT) and Indirect Antibody Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (I-ELISA). The overall prevalence of antibodies against Brucella abortus in the Nakasongola and Luwero districts was 2. 4 % and 4. 7 % on RBPT, compared with 1. 2 % and 3. 34 % on I-ELISA.

40|$|Leishmanicidal drugs {{interacting}} stoichiometrically with parasite {{plasma membrane}} lipids, thus promoting permeability, have raised significant expectations for Leishmania chemotherapy {{due to their}} nil or very low induction of resistance. Inherent in this process is a decrease in intracellular ATP, either wasted by ionic pumps to restore membrane potential or directly leaked through larger membrane lesions caused by the drug. We have adapted a luminescence method for fast automated real-time monitoring of this process, using Leishmania donovani promastigotes transfected with a cytoplasmic luciferase form, previously tested for anti-mitochondrial drugs. The system was first assayed against a set of well-known membrane-active drugs [amphotericin B, nystatin, cecropin A-melittin peptide CA(1 - 8) M(1 - 18) ], plus two ionophoric polyethers (narasin and salinomycin) not previously tested on Leishmania, then used to screen seven new cecropin A-melittin hybrid peptides. All membrane-active compounds showed a good correlation between inhibition of luminescence and leishmanicidal activity. Induction of membrane permeability was demonstrated by dissipation of membrane potential, SYTOX trade mark Green influx and membrane damage assessed by electron microscopy, except for the polyethers, where ATP decrease was due to inhibition of its mitochondrial synthesis. Five of the test peptides showed an ED 50 around 1 microM on promastigotes. These peptides, with equal or better activity than 26 -residue-long CA(1 - 8) M(1 - 18), are the shortest leishmanicidal peptides described so far, and validate our luminescence assay as a fast and <b>cheap</b> <b>screening</b> tool for membrane-active compounds...|$|E
40|$|Screening {{tests for}} {{bacteriuria}} {{based on two}} different principles were evaluated in 1582 schoolgirls aged 5 - 11 years, and in 26 girls aged 3 - 16 years attending hospitalwith symptomatic urinary tract infection. Tests for hypoglucosuria, performed by a semi-automated fluorometric method and with Uriglox strips on early-morning urine samples voided after overnight fasting, gave unacceptably high false-negative rates (16. 7 % and 20. 8 % respectively). Oxoid and Uricult dipslides were immersed in fresh midstreamspecimens of urine obtained at school and read overnight incubation at 37 degrees C. Both gave comparable results, with low false-positive rates and no false-negative responses. The higher cost of screening by dipslides was halved by using the "dipstream" technique, which also gave no false-negative results. Its false-positive rate of 13. 5 % could be reduced to 1. 8 % by disregarding colony counts of 10 - 8 non-faecal organisms and over per litre, which appear unimportant in schoolchildren. Bacteriuria was found in 2. 3 % of the schoolgirls; 39 % of them had symptons, compared with 7. 2 % of the healthy girls, and 25 % showed vesicoureteric reflux, which in 17 % was associated with renalscarring.

40|$|Pancreatic cancer {{represents}} one of the most deadly human malignancies with an overall 5 -year survival of less than 5 %. Despite improvements in imaging techniques and surgical techniques, survival statistics have hardly improved over the past decades. To improve the dismal outlook it would be highly desirable to develop a program to detect precursor lesions or small asymptomatic early cancers at the time when the disease is still at a curable stage. Screening the general population for disease presence is not feasible at present because of the relatively low disease incidence and the lack of a noninvasive, reliable and <b>cheap</b> <b>screening</b> tool. Targeted surveillance programs, however, in individuals at high risk for developing pancreatic cancer, like mutation carriers of pancreatic cancer prone hereditary (tumor) syndromes or individuals with a strong family history of pancreatic cancer without a known underlying genetic defect, might be feasible. Careful consideration of the criteria put forward by Wilson and Jungner as published by the World Health Organization on the principles and practice of screening for disease, indicate that surveillance in this high-risk population by means of endosonography (EUS) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents a promising development, though experimental. It nicely points out which open questions need to be addressed. Among others, these include how to acquire {{a better understanding of the}} natural behavior and progression of precursor lesions towards invasive cancer, how to firmly establish the performance characteristics of EUS and MRI for the detection of (early) lesions in individuals at high risk for pancreatic cancer, and how to determine which lesions can be safely observed with continued surveillance and which lesions justify resectio...|$|E

Because {{of the high}} number of undetected cases, rapid and <b>cheaper</b> <b>screening</b> methods are needed. Currently, the CD diagnosis involves the detection of anti-transglutaminase IgA antibodies (anti-tTG IgA) in blood serum through the use of ELISA systems with confirmation by histology of the intestinal mucosa. A new, rapid magneto-electrochemical immunosensor for CD diagnosis has been developed and applied to serum sample analysis. The system uses magnetic beads coated with tTG antigen to detect anti-tTG antibodies in positive serum samples and an alkaline phosphataseconjugated anti-human IgA as label. An electrochemical readout, using magnetized screen-printed electrodes coupled with a portable instrument, is made after the addition of α- naphtyl phosphate, which is enzymatically converted into the electrochemically active α-naphthol product.

There is limited information about the knowledge and practice of Iranian women about early detection of breast cancer and in this study we aimed to investigate it in Kerman. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study done on 120 women; from 6 randomly selected maternal and childcare centers spread around Kerman, women were questioned about the primary signs of breast cancer and the screening methods. Results: The results show that 70 % of women thought that with on time detection, breast cancer can be successfully treated, but 47 % had no idea about any screening method. The most common breast cancer sign mentioned by women was a painless lump. Breast self examination as the easiest and <b>cheapest</b> <b>screening</b> method was never done in 51 % of women. The most common reason for not performing screening tests in the participants, was not knowing anything about it.

40|$|Background: The {{mounting}} evidence linking hypothyroidism during pregnancy with poor pregnancy outcome underscores {{the need for}} screening and, therefore, a search for more reliable and <b>cheaper</b> <b>screening</b> methods. Methods: The {{study was conducted in}} two phases. The phase one study comprised of healthy women in different stages of pregnancy who attended routine antenatal clinic at St Theresa’s Maternity Hospital, Enugu, Nigeria from September 6 to October 18 1994. In this study the variables compared between the hypothyroid and nonhypothyroid pregnant women were maternal age, the number of the pregnancy or gravidity, gestational age, social class, body weight, height, the clinically assessed size of the thyroid gland, serum free thyroxin (FT 4) and serum thyrotrophin (TSH). Based on the parameter differences between the two comparison groups of pregnant women two Logistic models, Model I and Model 11, were derived to differentiate the hypothyroid group from their non-hypothyroid counterparts. The two logistic models were then applied in a prospective validation study involving 197 pregnant women seen at presentation in Mother of Christ Specialist Hospital and Maternity, Ogui Road, Enugu from March 2002 to November 2007 Findings: The findings were that 82 (50. 3 %) of the 163 pregnant women had thyroid gland enlargement while 60 (36. 8 %) had hypothyroidism as defined by FT 4 values below and/or TSH above their laboratory reference ranges...|$|R
40|$|Raw plastic {{materials}} used in the plastic manufacturing industries are pellets, powder or sheet mixtures constituted by the main polymer together with several additives (e. g., plasticizers, stabilizers, antioxidants, pigments). The manufacturing processes themselves depend on both the polymer characteristics and the artifact characteristics. During the plastic manufacturing, toxic products can enter the working environment due to the plastic heating. A complete environmental analysis looking for all the pollutants that can be foreseen is usually carried out to define if the workers' risk level is acceptable or not. Therefore, a simple and <b>cheap</b> <b>screening</b> procedure has been developed and validated by comparison with environmental analysis carried out in two PVC manufacturing industries. Such a procedure can give information on which toxic products are expected to enter the working environment {{as well as on}} the relative amount of such products, and it can be used to screen which situations deserve a deeper environmental analysis. For this reason, a preliminary study aimed to evaluate the release of toxic compounds in manufactures of extruded cables has been carried out. Main aim of the work was to identify and quantify the possible emissions released by several PVC-based materials once they undergo heating treatments; typical operating conditions that are used during cable production have been reproduced in a laboratory-scale apparatus and different analytical techniques have been applied in order to detect the emissions. In particular, the attention has been focused on the determination of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and aldehydes.

We therefore studied the pattern of urinary abnormalities among an apparently healthy urban population. Methods: Mid-stream clean catch urine samples were collected from 1048 apparently healthy subjects and tested for urinary abnormalities using the dipstick method following a health promotional talk in Idi-araba, a Lagos slum. Results: A total of 1048 randomly selected subjects {{with a mean age of}} 38. 7 ΁ 14. 5 years (age range 18 - 85 years) were screened. This consisted of 597 (57 %) females and 451 (43 %) males. Protenuria, hematuria, leucocyturia, nitrituria, and glucosuria were present in 18. 9 %, 1. 7 %, 9. 2 %, 1. 8 % and 2 % of the subjects respectively. Proteinuria and haematuria was more prevalent in subjects aged ≥ 40 years (P < 0. 05). The prevalence of leucocyturia, nitrituria, and glucosuria were independent of age (P < 0. 05). There were no gender differences in the prevalence of urinary abnormalities (P < 0. 05). Four hundred and forty-four (42. 3 %) of the cohort had hypertension (HTN). Proteinuria and leucocyturia were more prevalent in hypertensive subjects (P < 0. 05) while hematuria, nitrituria, and glucosuria was independent of hypertensive status of subjects (P < 0. 05).

30|$|When client firms hire {{personnel}} from a TWA they assume—after accounting for hiring and firing costs—that the worker provided {{is the best}} possible match and that their own effort in recruiting {{would not be able}} to compete with the TWA’s outcome. One hypothesis is that the TWAs increase the probability of a worker’s gaining permanent employment in the regular labor market by increasing their human capital, signaling working ambitions, expanding the worker’s network, and serving as a <b>cheap</b> <b>screening</b> device. The last two effects are especially vital for immigrants since they are likely to be subject to statistical discrimination. The type of screening service that a TWA offers in effect is likely to be one of the most powerful remedies against statistical discrimination since the client firm will be able to observe the real productivity without hiring the worker. Since employers usually have a hard time adequately assessing an immigrant’s abilities, education, and skills acquired in a different environment, TWAs could be a remedy, working as a cheap probation device where the uncertainty and risk has been incorporated into the TWA itself. It is also reasonable to believe that the immigrant’s working network is weaker than natives’ and just getting a job helps build up country-specific human capital, such as language skills and a deeper knowledge of how the labor market works 3. Another reason to further investigate the effect on immigrants is their over-representation in the industry (Andersson Joona and Wadensjö 2010). All these things taken together give reason to believe that immigrants may specially benefit from TWA employment. The opposite sign is of course also possible due to stigmatization. In the present paper I will estimate the causal impact of employment in a TWA on the medium and long-run transition rate from unemployment to regular labor market employment, with extra focus on non-western immigrants 4.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{molecular}} {{mechanisms of}} exosome biogenesis and secretion are poorly understood. An important role {{is dedicated to}} the small GTPase Rab 27 B, a regulator of vesicle exocytosis that delivers pro-invasive signals for increased tumor size, invasiveness and metastasis of various estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cell lines, both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro MCF- 7 GFP-Rab 27 B cells are used to hunt down the influence of a series of compounds on exosome secretion. V-ATPase inhibitors, bafilomycin A 1 and concanamycin A, because of demonstrated presence of V-ATPase subunits on GFP-Rab 27 B vesicles. And cytoskeleton inhibitors, cytochalasin D and nocodazole to undermine intracellular vesicle transport routes. Methods: MTT assays are performed to study the influence of the compounds on cell proliferation. To study the compounds their effect the design consists of two legs. In the quantitative leg nanoparticle tracking analysis is performed on isolated particles from conditioned medium of treated cells to study the difference in total particle secretion. In the morphological leg fluorescence microscopy is performed on treated cells to observe changes in intracellular localization of GFP-Rab 27 B vesicles containing exosomes. Results: All used compounds display reversible lowering in total particle concentration. Individual reversible inhibition of V-ATPase activity and cytoskeleton morphology demonstrates that the substrates control peripheral localization of Rab 27 B vesicles. This suggests the particle lowering observed in the quantitative leg is due to reduction in exosome secretion. Conclusion: Inhibiting V-ATPase activity and interfering cytoskeleton architecture by administration of drugs is potentially linked to a lowering of exosome secretion in ERα-positive breast cancer. The positive screening of these inhibitors reveals essential compounds in the exosome releasing pathway and proposes new perspectives for potential prevention of further metastasis in the future.

Identification of severely insulin-resistant patients who have genetic or acquired insulin receptor dysfunction may aid therapeutic decision making; however, onerous diagnostic tests allied to a low frequency of insulin receptor dysfunction often preclude formal diagnosis. Our previous observation of paradoxical hyperadiponectinemia in insulin receptoropathy provides a possible basis for a simpler and <b>cheaper</b> <b>screening</b> test. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Receiver operating characteristics {{analysis was used to}} determine diagnostic thresholds for insulin receptoropathy in severe insulin resis-tance for adiponectin and for the insulin-regulated hepatic proteins sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) and IGF binding protein- 1 (IGFBP- 1). RESULTS — Adiponectin 7 mg/l in severe {{insulin resistance}} had a 97 % positive predictive value for insulin receptoropathy and 5 mg/l a 97 % negative predictive value. IGFBP- 1 and SHBG had lesser, though still significant, utility. CONCLUSIONS — Use of these markers is likely to have significant value in accelerating the diagnosis of insulin receptoropathies. Diabetes Care 31 : 977 – 979, 2008 P athology in the insulin receptor un-derlies at least two forms of extremeinsulin resistance, namely those caused by mutations in the receptor or by autoantibodies against the receptor. While clinical features are helpful in dis-tinguishing these syndromes from more common forms of insulin resistance, they are not definitive (1, 2). Diagnostic labo-ratory testing for these disorders is cum-bersome and, for the most part, not available from commercial resources. A simple and highly specific screening test would therefore be of special utility. We have previously reported that plasma adi-ponectin is elevated in these receptoropa-thies in contrast to other forms of severe insulin resistance (3, 4), and we now for-mally assess the diagnostic performance of adiponectin as well as IGF binding pro-tein- 1 (IGFBP- 1) and sex hormone– binding globulin (SHBG), which are both insulin responsive (5, 6) ...|$|R

40|$|Liposome based sensors are {{inspired}} to the sensorial functions of biological membranes; in fact, ligand-receptor interactions mediated by lipid bilayers {{are involved in}} physiological activities of biological membranes such as signal transduction and information processing {{that are based on}} lipid reorganization. The aim of this work is to explore the possibility of developing a novel liposome based sensor for detecting the presence, and possibly dosing, the activity of thymidylate synthase, thymidine phosphorylase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of pyrimidines and are target of a potent chemotherapic agent, 5 −fluorouracil (5 -FU), widely employed in the treatment {{of some of the most}} frequently occurring malignant solid tumors (breast, colon and skin cancer). The need of rapid and accurate detection of the activity of these enzymes before and during 5 -FU treatment to individuate patients who can’t be treated or the optimal doses of treatment for treated patients is a problem of major concern. At present simple, fast, reliable and <b>cheap</b> <b>screening</b> methods to dose the activity of the three enzymes before and during the treatment with 5 -FU do not exist. The work reported in this thesis is aimed at developing an optical sensor based on the specific interaction of liposomes with the target enzymes. To this end, liposomes were formulated with both commercial and ad hoc designed lipids to give a fluorescent response upon the interaction with the target enzymes. The interaction of target enzymes with specific liposomes, promoted by 5 -FU exposed on the lipid membrane, could induce lipid reorganization and segregation in domains according to lipid component charge features. The lipid reorganization should trigger the response from a pyrene moiety linked to a cationic amphihile embedded in the lipid bilayer. Liposome membranes and Langmuir monolayers composed of different amounts of 1, 2 - dimyristoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphatidylcoline (DMPC) or 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- phosphocholine (DOPC) and a pyrene-containing lipid were investigated to study the influence of the molecular structure and of the amount of components on lipid organization and miscibility. Moreover, the formation of regular lipid organization was investigated in a 3 small range of concentration by fluorescence on liposomes and by Langmuir isotherms on lipid monolayers. Lipid organization is significantly affected by the rigidity of the pyrrolidinium ring of the fluorescent cationic amphiphile and by the balance between repulsive and attractive electrostatic interactions. The different behavior of mixed monolayers containing DMPC or DOPC and the pyrene tagged amphiphile shows that, besides the interactions between lipid headgroups, other parameters such as surface hydration and the nature of the alkyl chains have to be considered to achieve a complete understanding of the physicalchemistry and dynamics of mixed lipid systems. In particular, at certain molar fractions, lipid bilayers present regions organized in regular arrangements, probably hexagonal lattices where the acyl chains form regular patterns around the pyrene labelled chain of the synthetic component. This work allowed individuating the range of component ratio suitable to obtain a detectable fluorescent signal in response to lipid reorganization, further it has demonstrated that the novel 5 -FU derivatives are able to interact with the target enzymes when embedded in the liposome bilayer. Both findings are good premises for the development of a sensor for the target enzymes...|$|E

PA can ultimately trigger the onset of severe acute and chronic infections, especially in immunosuppressed subjects. The QS network in PA is comprised of at least four multi-layered interconnected subsystems with hierarchical organisation. From these, three (las, rhl and pqs) play a pivotal role in the production of virulence factors (e. g., lectins and pyocyanin) with relevant participation in the development and maintenance of biofilm matrices. The QS network is divided in two major signaling pathways, the one driven by N-acylhomoserine lactone signals and the one driven by 2 -alkyl- 4 -quinolone molecules. Two alkyl quinolones of core importance exist in PA, the 2 -heptyl- 3 -hydroxy- 4 (1 H) quinolone, typically recognised as the “Pseudomonas quinolone signal” (PQS) and its precursor 2 -heptyl- 4 (1 H) -quinolone (HHQ). In addition to the regulatory involvement of the las and rhl quorum sensing systems, the biosynthesis of PQS production is also positively regulated by PqsR-dependent transcription of the pqsABCDE operon (a multivirulence factor regulator also known as MvfR). For that reason, the alkyl quinolone (AQ) signalling pathway, and more specifically its major regulator PqsR, are widely seen as promising targets for novel antimicrobial approaches. Because of the growing presence of multidrug resistant PA in the clinical setting, representing both an immediate menace to immunocompromised patients and a heavy burden on hospital budgets, the development of more rapid and affordable screening strategies for detection of the pathogen are required. Thus, new screening strategies adapted to clinical samples and successful novel synthetic small PqsR antagonists can lead the way to a new Era in the battle against hyper-virulent/-resistant PA strains. Primarily focusing on the AQ system, this research project investigated three inter-related areas, namely: (a) the highthroughput screening of novel synthetic small molecule antagonists of the PqsR protein, designed for suppression of virulence-associated phenotypes, (b) the development of a luminescent PQS-based screening bioreporter to be applied in the clinical setting, and finally (c) the optimisation of a methodology combining liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA) and mass spectrometry (MS) for screening PQS-related AQs from in vivo bacterial extracts, and also intended for future screening of a variety of clinical samples (e. g., blood plasma, urine and saliva). A large number of synthetic small molecules with putative PqsR antagonism were obtained from our French partner GreenPharma, and studied for their capacity to interfere with expression of the key player of the pqs system, PqsR. By applying a rational selection strategy, based on the inhibitory effects on pqsA expression, assessment of metabolical exertion, and assay studies on the ultimate repression of key virulence-associated phenotypes (lectins LecA and LecB, pyocyanin, PQS-associated AQs) and impact on biolfilm formation, a final selection comprised of the four best antagonists was obtained. Compounds GPZ 002966, GPZ 004927, GPZ 824390 and GPZ 273902 had their cytotoxicity subsequently studied keeping in mind their applicability in pre-clinical studies. Overall, these PqsR antagonists promoted very strong inhibition of pqsA and lecA expression, strongly reduced production of pyocyanin and PQS-related AQs (HHQ, HQNO and C 7 -PQS itself), showed a strong degree of biofilm inhibition, with IC 50 scores sitting at the nanomolar level, and no signs of metabolical arrest was reported by the test strains used. Some explanations, focusing on the functional and structural organisation/composition of these compounds are also offered based on a comparative analysis against a number of the most prolific PqsR antagonists recently developed. The bioluminescent PQS-based biosensor for the detection of PA was engineered to respond to the presence of exogenous PQS that forms a complex with the regulatory PqsR protein, ultimately stimulating the expression of a luxCDABE-fused pqsA promoter. The biosensor was subsequently inserted in a non-pathogenic E. coli recipient by means of chromosomal integration, devoid of the sdiA LuxR homolog that could potentially interfere with the recognition of PqsR. A silent reporter was observed when in E. coli, but further assessments to its genetic integrity did not reveal any single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). In addition, after further testings to its activity in different established PA mutants, devoid of genes that constituted the bioreporting system or to it directly associated, a fully functional bioreporter was confirmed. Finally, a few possible explanations as to what might be in the origin of a defective bioreporter in E. coli are discussed. Lastly, a new LESA-MS protocol based on the surface sampling of dried bacterial extracts, envisaging its potentialities as a rapid and <b>cheap</b> <b>screening</b> method for detection of AQs, was designed and optimised. Even though the method has been widely used in a variety of research scenarios, {{this is the first time}} LESA-MS is applied as a screening methodology in the context of bacterial extract screening. Overall, the optimisation process showed that LESA-MS is an approach with numerous potentialities and immediate advantages, where one emphasises sampling simplicity, fast delivering of results, sensitivity to AQs at the nanomolar level (especially for C 7 -PQS and the precursor HHQ). But simultaneously, this methodology also revealed limitations inherent to its setting up that constrain an effective screening. The most emphatic ones being the volatility of the preparations to intra-sampling variability, and to a certain degree, an unexpected insensitivity to important QS N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), namely C 4 -HSL and 3 -oxo-C 12 -HSL. Nevertheless, such limitations do not present themselves as an insurmountable barrier, and based on results from available studies making use of the LESA-MS a number of possibilities to work around these are also presented...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{standard}} dementia {{screening tool}} Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) {{and the standard}} dementia staging tool Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) are prominent methods for answering questions whether a person might have dementia and about the dementia severity respectively. These methods are time consuming and require well-educated personnel to administer. Conversely, cognitive tests, such as the Semantic Verbal Fluency (SVF), demand little time. With this as a starting point, we investigate the relation between SVF results and MMSE/CDR-SOB scores. We use regression models to predict scores based on persons' SVF performance. Over a set of 179 patients with different degree of dementia, we achieve a mean absolute error of of 2. 2 for MMSE (range 0 – 30) and 1. 7 for CDR-SOB (range 0 – 18). True and predicted scores agree with a Cohen's κ of 0. 76 for MMSE and 0. 52 for CDR-SOB. We conclude that our approach has potential {{to serve as a}} <b>cheap</b> dementia <b>screening,</b> possibly even in non-clinical settings...|$|R

In August 2013, Sony addressed the first two, dropping the price to $199 in North America and €199 in Europe, and cutting the suggested retail price of the memory cards as well. The price cut also coincided with the release of a slight redesign of the system, the [...] "PS Vita 2000" [...] model.

40|$|Current x-ray {{technologies}} {{provide security}} personnel with non-invasive sub-surface imaging and contraband detection in various portal screening {{applications such as}} checked and carry-on baggage as well as cargo. Computed tomography (CT) scanners generate detailed 3 D imagery in checked bags; however, these scanners often require significant power, cost, and space. These tomography machines are impractical for many applications where space and power are often limited such as checkpoint areas. Reducing the amount of data acquired would help reduce the physical demands of these systems. Unfortunately {{this leads to the}} formation of artifacts in various applications, thus presenting significant challenges in reconstruction and classification. As a result, the goal is to maintain a certain level of image quality but reduce the amount of data gathered. For the security domain this would allow for faster and <b>cheaper</b> <b>screening</b> in existing systems or allow for previously infeasible screening options due to other operational constraints. While our focus is predominantly on security applications, many of the techniques can be extended to other fields such as the medical domain where a reduction of dose can allow for safer and more frequent examinations. This dissertation aims to advance data reduction algorithms for security motivated x-ray imaging in three main areas: (i) development of a sensing aware dimensionality reduction framework, (ii) creation of linear motion tomographic method of object scanning and associated reconstruction algorithms for carry-on baggage screening, and (iii) the application of coded aperture techniques to improve and extend imaging performance of nuclear resonance fluorescence in cargo screening. The sensing aware dimensionality reduction framework extends existing dimensionality reduction methods to include knowledge of an underlying sensing mechanism of a latent variable. This method provides an improved classification rate over classical methods on both a synthetic case and a popular face classification dataset. The linear tomographic method is based on non-rotational scanning of baggage moved by a conveyor belt, and can thus be simpler, smaller, and more reliable than existing rotational tomography systems at the expense of more challenging image formation problems that require special model-based methods. The reconstructions for this approach are comparable to existing tomographic systems. Finally our coded aperture extension of existing nuclear resonance fluorescence cargo scanning provides improved observation signal-to-noise ratios. We analyze, discuss, and demonstrate the strengths and challenges of using coded aperture techniques in this application and provide guidance on regimes where these methods can yield gains over conventional methods...|$|R

Central {{to the success of}} marker assisted breeding is the availability of faster and <b>cheaper</b> marker <b>screening</b> techniques. These techniques have become increasingly important as breeding methodologies attempt to manage and manipulate entire genomes by simultaneously using large numbers of markers to select and combine the most favorable regions of chromosomes. Here, we describe a novel multiplex PCR assay for low-cost, high-throughput marker genotyping on an automated DNA fragment analyser, such as the ABI 3730. This assay allows published markers (e. g. SSRs and allele-specific STSs) to be coamplified in a single-step, closed-tube reaction under standardized conditions that require no optimization, irrespective of the optimal annealing temperature of each marker. The assay also provides several technological advantages that facilitate automated DNA fragment analysis including: (a) an ability to label each marker with a fluorescent dye of choice during multiplex PCR amplification, and (b) relatively uniform yield of PCR product for each marker, permitting the use of standardized protocols to prepare PCR fragments for DNA fragment analysis. The multiplex PCR technology is currently deployed in several Australian cereal breeding and research programs...|$|R

Besides using drugs to lower blood sugar, a balanced diet and the intake of herbal products potentially limiting AGE formation could be considered beneficial for patients’ health. The current paper presents a simple and <b>cheap</b> high-throughput <b>screening</b> (HTS) assay based on AGE fluorescence and suitable for plant extract screening. We have already implemented an HTS assay based on vesperlysines-like fluorescing AGEs quickly (24 h) formed from BSA and ribose under physiological conditions. However, interference was noted when fluorescent compounds and/or complex mixtures were tested. To overcome these problems and apply this HTS assay to plant extracts, we developed a technique for systematic quantification of both vesperlysines (λexc 370 nm; λem 440 nm) and pentosidine-like (λexc 335 nm; λem 385 nm) AGEs. In a batch of medicinal and food plant extracts, hits were selected as soon as fluorescence decreased under a fixed threshold for at least one wavelength. Hits revealed during this study appeared to contain well-known and powerful anti-AGE substances, thus demonstrating the suitability of this assay for screening crude extracts (0. 1 mg/mL). Finally, quercetin was found to be a more powerful reference compound than aminoguanidine in such assay...|$|R
