Hu Nim was to take this route in 1955: intending to become a customs officer, he studied at the <b>Customs</b> <b>School</b> and law school in Paris, travelling several hours every day by Metro to get to his place of study.

50|$|Reinhardt {{could count}} on the Nazi Party's and Hitler's backing, which was why he held such an {{influential}} position from the outset. Reinhardt made the decisions as to taxation. Under him were the Tax and <b>Customs</b> <b>School</b> - set up by him in 1935 - and the Zollgrenzschutz ("Customs Service"). It {{was one of the}} components of the programs aimed at reducing unemployment, which collectively were also known as the Reinhardt Program. It is held by some, particularly German, historians that Reinhardt gave his name also to Operation Reinhard, although broader understanding especially after its termination has associated that program's name with Reinhard Heydrich, first head of the RSHA. The confusion stemmed from the fact that Heydrich had spelled his first name both Reinhard and Reinhardt throughout the 1930s during his career in the SS.|$|E

5000|$|Modernization of the Ottoman Empire {{occurred}} during his reign, including {{reform of the}} bureaucracy, {{the extension of the}} Rumelia Railway and Anatolia Railway and the construction of the Baghdad Railway and Hejaz Railway. In addition, a system for population registration and control over the press was established along with the first local modern law school in 1898. The most far-reaching of these reforms were in education: many professional schools were established, including Law School, School of Arts, School of Trades, Civil Engineering School, The Veterinarian School, The <b>Customs</b> <b>School,</b> The Farming School, The Linguistic School, and more. The University of Istanbul, although shut down by Abdul Hamid in 1881, was reopened in 1900, and a network of secondary, primary, and military schools was extended throughout the empire.
