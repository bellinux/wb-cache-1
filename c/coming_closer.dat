5|$|Washington and {{the army}} were {{surrounded}} on Brooklyn Heights with the East River to their backs. As the day went on, the British began to dig trenches, slowly <b>coming</b> <b>closer</b> to the American defenses. By doing this, the British {{would not have to}} cross over open ground to assault the American defenses as they did in Boston the year before. Despite this perilous situation, Washington ordered 1,200 more men from Manhattan to Brooklyn on August 28. The men that came over were two Pennsylvania regiments and Colonel John Glover's regiment from Marblehead, Massachusetts. In command of the Pennsylvanian troops was Thomas Mifflin who, after arriving, volunteered to inspect the outer defenses and report back to Washington. In these outer defenses, small skirmishes were still taking place. On the afternoon of August 28, it began to rain and Washington had his cannons bombard the British well into the night.|$|E
5|$|The {{long take}} video begins with many people dancing on a hallway, until a girl comes and opens a door {{which leads to}} a room. There, other dancers are dancing to the song in midway of white rays of light, until the camera shows Jackson {{in the corner of the}} room and they start {{performing}} a dance routine. While the singer disappears from vision, people dance until she appears again dancing to the song. Then she goes to a hallway and enters a red-lighted room, accompanied by dancers, where entertainer Mimi Marks is seen. There she dances another routine along with her dancers. After dancing, she enters in another hallway where she gets alone with a man, until they share a kiss. Then, people who were in the previous room enter to the hallway to connect to another room, with Marks taking Jackson with her. The video ends with people <b>coming</b> <b>closer</b> to Jackson.|$|E

5|$|At {{approximately}} 10:00, {{the runway}} at Khâm Đức was cleared of the wrecked helicopter. Moments later, a C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Daryl D. Cole touched {{down on the}} runway under heavy fire, which flattened one tire and caused extensive damage to the wing tanks. Almost immediately, Cole's aircraft was rushed by hysterical Vietnamese civilians from ditches along the runway, filling the aircraft so the loadmaster was prevented from unloading the aircraft's cargo. Under heavy fire, Cole decided to navigate his aircraft down the cratered and shrapnel-littered runway, {{in order to take}} off. However, the combined weight of the cargo and civilians, in addition to the damage sustained during landing, prevented the aircraft from gathering enough speed to take off. So the aircrew aborted the take off, offloaded the civilians, and proceeded to cut off the blown tire to stop it from flapping and slowing down the aircraft. They were able to cut off the rubber with the bayonet, and were able to cut through the steel beading thanks to the engineers carefully cutting the steel cords with a blowtorch. A fire extinguisher was kept handy because of fear of catching the magnesium wheel on fire. About two hours later, realizing that enemy artillery rounds were <b>coming</b> <b>closer</b> to his aircraft, Colonel Cole tried to take off for the second time, and managed to get the C-130 into the air. This time his only passengers were three members of Air Force Combat Control Team (CCT), whose radio equipment had been destroyed.|$|E

Nevertheless, Muller abandoned the siege and began falling back on Mannheim. By 13 September, most of the Army of the Rhine was safely {{on the west bank}} of the Rhine.

500|$|Several {{different}} routes {{were considered}} for the alignment. The path ultimately selected by the state was a four-lane, limited-access highway [...] north of the current alignment that would cost $5.5million (1966USD). Another proposed route would have cost $8million (1966USD), containing additional grades and curves while <b>coming</b> <b>closer</b> to the Rockefeller estate. Construction on the new NY117 was expected to begin {{before the end of}} 1966. The reaction from area residents was mixed, with some believing that the only beneficiaries of a realigned NY117 was the Rockefeller family. Rumors that the Rockefeller family had wanted NY117 moved had existed as early as the 1930s, and US Representative Richard Ottinger believed that Nelson Rockefeller, then the Governor of New York, was using his political power to move NY117 away from Kykuit at the cost of the state.

500|$|Players can split {{their cell}} into two by {{pressing}} , {{and one of}} the two evenly divided cells will be flung {{in the direction of the}} cursor (a maximum of 16 split cells). This can be used as a ranged attack to shoot a cell in order to swallow other smaller cells, to escape an attack from another cell, or to move more quickly around the map. Split cells eventually merge back into one cell. Aside from feeding viruses, players can eject (release) a small fraction of their mass to feed other cells, an action commonly recognized as an intention to team with another player. This can be done by pressing the [...] key. A player can also eject mass to trick enemies into <b>coming</b> <b>closer</b> to the player.
