40|$|WO 2005029734 A UPAB: 20050512 NOVELTY - The {{regenerator}} has {{an optical}} <b>clock</b> <b>regeneration</b> stage (2), which generates synchronized, stable optical reset clock pulses for a data signal (1). The semiconductor component is non-linear {{with reference to}} the transmission characteristics for the data signal (5, 9). A part of a degraded data signal is transmitted to the <b>clock</b> <b>regeneration</b> stage and the generated clock pulse is transmitted to the semiconductor component. The <b>clock</b> <b>regeneration</b> stage is configured {{in such a way that}} a timed optical reset to achieve transparency occurs. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A time-slice control unit (3), is connected upstream of the semiconductor component and defines a sequence of data bits in the time gap between two respective clock pulses. The other part of the degraded data signal is transmitted to the semiconductor component at a power, at which the semiconductor component, relaxing from the condition of transparency, exhibits a non-linear transmission characteristic for the data signal. A blocking unit is connected downstream of the semiconductor component and removes the reset clock pulses from the data signal path. USE - For optical signals ADVANTAGE - Degraded optical signals with high data rate are transmitted and regenerated without optoelectronic or wavelength conversion using compact, non-linear semiconductor components with low power consumption...|$|E

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} on digital optical transmission systems at bit rates of 1 and 2 Gbit/s are described. Systems with graded-index and single-mode fibers in the optical {{short and long}} wavelength region were investigated. All systems include complete circuits for <b>clock</b> and signal <b>regeneration.</b> Special emphasis was laid {{on the development of}} electronic circuits for gigabit signal processing and on the investigations of the noise sources of the optical channel, which appear especially pronounced in broad-band systems. The experimental results confirm the possibility to set up reliable high-speed optical transmission systems under laboratory conditions with available components. The remaining problems are of optical and not of electronic nature, despite the fact that monolithic integrated circuits for gigabit applications are hardly commercially available today...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{intestine}} {{has evolved}} under constant environmental stresses, because an animal may ingest harmful pathogens or chemicals {{at any time}} during its lifespan. Following damage, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) regenerate the intestine by proliferating to replace dying cells. ISCs from diverse animals are remarkably similar, and the Wnt, Notch, and Hippo signaling pathways, important regulators of mammalian ISCs, are conserved from flies to humans. Unexpectedly, we identified the transcription factor period, a component of the circadian clock, to be critical for regeneration, which itself follows a circadian rhythm. We discovered hundreds of transcripts that are regulated by the <b>clock</b> during intestinal <b>regeneration,</b> including components of stress response and regeneration pathways. Disruption of clock components leads to arrhythmic ISC divisions, revealing their underappreciated role in the healing process...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND and AIMS: The {{gastrointestinal}} {{syndrome is}} an illness of the intestine caused by {{high levels of}} radiation. It is characterized by extensive loss of epithelial tissue integrity, which initiates a regenerative response by intestinal stem and precursor cells. The intestine has 24 -hour rhythms in many physiological functions that {{are believed to be}} outputs of the circadian clock: a molecular system that produces 24 -hour rhythms in transcription/translation. Certain gastrointestinal illnesses are worsened when the circadian rhythms are disrupted, but the role of the circadian <b>clock</b> in gastrointestinal <b>regeneration</b> has not been studied. METHODS: We tested the timing of regeneration in the mouse intestine during the gastrointestinal syndrome. The role of the circadian clock was tested genetically using the BMAL 1 loss of function mouse mutant in vivo, and in vitro using intestinal organoid culture. RESULTS: The proliferation of the intestinal epithelium follows a 24 -hour rhythm during the gastrointestinal syndrome. The circadian clock runs in the intestinal epithelium during this pathologic state, and the loss of the core clock gene, BMAL 1, disrupts both the circadian clock and rhythmic proliferation. Circadian activity in the intestine involves a rhythmic production of inflammatory cytokines and subsequent rhythmic activation of the JNK stress response pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that a circadian rhythm in inflammation and regeneration occurs during the gastrointestinal syndrome. The study and treatment of radiation-induced illnesses, and other gastrointestinal illnesses, should consider 24 -hour timing in physiology and pathology...|$|R

40|$|When {{continuous}} bit streams {{are transmitted}} over packet switching networks, the 'packetized' {{version of the}} real time traffic in a periodic sequence is distorted due to random transmission delay and packet loss. The need to recover the original continuous bit stream requires an estimation of the original source clock. This <b>clock</b> <b>regeneration</b> is called Circuit Emulation. Using a single phase lock loop is insufficient since the packet arrival jitter (PAJ) is generally very large. A circuit emulation technique that has been recently proposed provides algorithms to estimate the frequency difference between the original transmitter clock and a local retiming clock. A tracking loop similar to a PLL has been designed in this thesis to regenerate the original transmitter clock from the frequency difference estimated. Performance and simulation are studied for the PLL. It is found that by an appropriate choice of the tracking loop parameters, the transmitter clock can be regenerated with minimal jitter and delay...|$|E

40|$|The Plasticity Related Gene family covers five, brain-specific, transmembrane {{proteins}} (PRG 1 - 5, also termed LPPR 1 - 5) {{that operate}} in neuronal plasticity during development, aging and brain trauma. Here we investigated {{the role of}} the PRG family on axonal and filopodia outgrowth. Comparative analysis revealed the strongest outgrowth induced by PRG 3 (LPPR 1). During development, PRG 3 is ubiquitously located at the tip of neuronal processes and at the plasma membrane and declines with age. In utero electroporation of PRG 3 induced dendritic protrusions and accelerated spine formations in cortical pyramidal neurons. The neurite growth promoting activity of PRG 3 requires RasGRF 1 (RasGEF 1 /Cdc 25) mediated downstream signaling. Moreover, in axon collapse assays, PRG 3 -induced neurites resisted growth inhibitors such as myelin, Nogo-A (Reticulon/RTN- 4), thrombin and LPA and impeded the RhoA-Rock-PIP 5 K induced neurite repulsion. Transgenic adult mice with constitutive PRG 3 expression displayed strong axonal sprouting distal to a spinal cord lesion. Moreover, fostered PRG 3 expression promoted complex motor-behavioral recovery compared to wild type controls as revealed in the Schnell swim test (SST). Thus, PRG 3 emerges as a developmental RasGRF 1 -dependent conductor of filopodia formation and axonal growth enhancer. PRG 3 -induced neurites resist brain injury-associated outgrowth inhibitors and contribute to functional recovery after spinal cord lesions. Here, we provide evidence that PRG 3 operates as an essential neuronal growth promoter in the nervous system. Maintaining PRG 3 expression in aging brain may turn back the developmental <b>clock</b> for neuronal <b>regeneration</b> and plasticity...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of mapping a set of {{processes}} which communicate synchronously on a distributed platform. The Time Triggered Architecture (TTA) proposed by Kopetz for the communication mechanism of a distributed platform offers a direct mapping that would preserve the semantics of the specification. However, its exact implementation may, at times, be problematic as it requires the distributed platform to have the clocks of its components perfectly synchronized. We propose as implementation architecture a relaxation of TTA called Loosely Time-Triggered Architecture (LTTA), in which computing units perform writes into and reads from the communication medium independently, triggered by local, quasi-periodic but non synchronized, clocks. LTTA offers some of the advantages of TTA with lower hardware cost and greater flexibility. So far LTTA was studied for single directional two-users communications over an LTT bus. General topology was not studied. In this paper we propose a design flow that ensures semantics preservation for an LTT communication network with arbitrary topology. Key elements are two new protocols for <b>clock</b> <b>regeneration</b> and predictive traffic shaping. Our approach relies on a mathematical Model of Communication (MoC) that we describe in detail...|$|E
