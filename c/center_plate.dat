500|$|The Immortal title belt was {{replaced}} by the third design of the championship belt at the March 14, 2011 tapings of the March 17 episode of Impact!, introduced by the reigning champion at the time, Sting. The design featured seven gold plates over a black leather strap. The <b>center</b> <b>plate</b> had faux diamonds aligned along its multiple rounded edges, {{similar to that of the}} Big Gold Belt. Over the <b>center</b> <b>plate</b> was a large TNA Wrestling logo and below it the words [...] "Heavyweight Champion" [...] engraved in silver. On each side of the <b>center</b> <b>plate</b> was a group of three smaller plates, one with a TNA logo engraved while the other two featured separate corresponding halves of a globe, on either side of the TNA logo side plate.|$|E
500|$|During the championship's history it has {{had four}} designs, with the {{original}} title belt (which was unveiled in May 2007) having on its <b>center</b> <b>plate</b> an imprint of an eagle with its wings extended. The word [...] "World" [...] was placed above the eagle's head on a ribbon. The ribbon was wrapped around the bird's wings and body. Five stars were engraved on the ribbon when it passed over each of the bird's wings and the word [...] "Champion" [...] as it passed over the bird's talons. The words [...] "Heavyweight Wrestling" [...] were printed across the bird's chest. At {{the top of the}} <b>center</b> <b>plate</b> there was TNA logo. Four smaller side plates had an imprint of a globe centered with TNA's logo at {{the top and bottom of}} each. At each end of the title belt there was a small plate that covered the championship belt snaps with TNA's logo engraved on each.|$|E
40|$|A seized {{lube pump}} of a {{helicopter}} was investigated. Examination revealed that the pump got seized due to seizure at the 2 nd stage rotor and <b>centering</b> <b>plate</b> interface. Evidences suggest that the seizure was caused due to adhesive wear resulting from the debris generated in-situ. It has been established that constant rubbing of the 2 nd stage rotor key with the <b>centering</b> <b>plate</b> {{was responsible for the}} generation of debris. Factors such as improper lubrication or entrapment of foreign particles as the causes of failure have been ruled out. Analysis showed that with the present design of the rotor keys, such seizure in the lube pump is unavoidable. It is recommended that the rotor keys be redesigned so that the contacts between the keys and the <b>centering</b> <b>plate</b> are avoided. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report...|$|R

500|$|At the November 8, 2010 tapings of the November 11 {{episode of}} Impact!, TNA {{introduced}} a new design for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship belt, which the champion Jeff Hardy dubbed the [...] "Immortal Championship", {{as part of the}} Immortal storyline. The new design consisted of a purple strap with a silver <b>center</b> <b>plate</b> depicting a masked head (designed to resemble Hardy's face with face paint), the TNA logo on the forehead and blue lines along the mask. There were four irregular dodecagonal side plates on the title belt, shaped like stars with rounded edges on two of the sides of these plates.|$|E

500|$|On January 7, 2013, Raw, The Rock {{returned}} to WWE to confront his Rumble opponent, then reigning champion CM Punk. He also {{made his first}} SmackDown appearance in ten years on January 11 episode, attacking Team Rhodes Scholars with a Rock Bottom to Damien Sandow and a People's Elbow to Cody Rhodes. The Rock closed out the 20th-anniversary episode of Raw on January 14 {{with one of his}} famous [...] "Rock concerts", leading to a brawl with CM Punk. The following week on Raw, The Rock was attacked by The Shield. Vince McMahon then asserted that if The Shield attacked The Rock in his title match with CM Punk, Punk would be stripped of the WWE Championship. On January 27 at the Royal Rumble, Punk defeated The Rock after The Shield interfered. McMahon was about to strip Punk of the championship, however, at The Rock's request, he instead restarted the match. This culminated in The Rock defeating Punk to win his eighth WWE Championship, a win which marked The Rock's first WWE Championship reign in over ten years, and ending Punk's long reign as champion at 434 days. Punk received a title rematch with The Rock at Elimination Chamber, with the added stipulation that if The Rock was disqualified or counted out, he would lose the title, but Rock pinned Punk to retain the championship. The following night on Raw, The Rock unveiled the new WWE Championship during his championship celebration, with an entirely new <b>center</b> <b>plate</b> and his signature Brahma Bull logo on the side plates. The Rock then resumed his rivalry with John Cena, with Cena blaming his personal and professional troubles on his loss to The Rock the previous year. On April 7 at WrestleMania 29, Rock lost the WWE Championship to Cena, ending his reign at 70 days. Despite being advertised for the Raw after WrestleMania, where it was stated by SmackDown General Manager Booker T that The Rock was still entitled a re-match for the WWE Championship, The Rock did not appear because of a legitimate injury sustained during WrestleMania, in which his abdominal and adductor tendons tore from his pelvis. Johnson underwent surgery on April 23 to reattach the torn tendons.|$|E
