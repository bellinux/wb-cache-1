25|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, the Russian Empire {{captured}} large uninhabited steppe territories {{from the}} former Crimean Khanate. The systematic colonization of lands in what became known as Novorossiya (mainly Crimea, Taurida and around Odessa) began. Migrants from many ethnic groups (predominantly Ukrainians and Russians from Russia proper) <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> area. At the same time the discovery of coal in the Donets Basin also marked the commencement of a large-scale industrialization and an influx of workers {{from other parts of the}} Russian Empire.|$|E

Goltz <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> conclusion after observing dogs who had parts of their brains removed. David Ferrier, who became a hero of Sherrington's, disagreed. Ferrier maintained that there was localization of function in the brain. Ferrier's strongest evidence was a monkey who suffered from hemiplegia, paralysis affecting {{one side of the}} body only, after a cerebral lesion.|$|E

25|$|The Manila Provincial Road that {{traverses}} Quezon City to Manila {{was renamed}} Aurora Boulevard {{in her honor}} in 1951. In the same year Elpidio Quirino created the Aurora sub-province comprising Baler and surrounding areas in the adjacent Quezon Province. In 1978, Aurora became a separate province. Manuel and Aurora Quezón are the only spouses to have respective provinces in the Philippines named after them. The first major building erected on Aurora Boulevard (also called Aurora Avenue), that is, the Aurora Tower at the Araneta Center in Cubao, was named after her. Her foremost legacy {{in the field of}} education was Mount Carmel College of Baler (formerly called Mount Carmel High School), a Catholic mission school founded in 1948 by American Carmelite missionaries who <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> town upon her invitation. The Concerned Women of the Philippines named the Aurora Aragon Quezón Peace Awards after her. Aurora A. Quezón elementary school at San Andres Malate, Manila is also named for her.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, WCW's {{first major}} {{pay-per-view}} event since Hogan's hiring, Bash at the Beach, saw the former WWF mainstay cleanly defeat Ric Flair for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The two {{had worked for}} the WWF at the same time from 1991 to 1992, and a feud was teased between them, but the big-money match originally planned for WrestleMania VIII was changed to Flair/Savage and Hogan/Sid. When WCW delivered the match, the event drew a high buyrate by WCW standards due to mainstream intrigue and hype. Despite being a critical and financial success, the glory would not last, as the Hogan/Flair feud would only result in one more match (at Halloween Havoc) and the hope for long-term effects on pay-per-view buyrates and ratings did not materialize. Turner management <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> realization when they checked up {{on the state of the}} company in mid-1995. Hence, Bischoff called Turner and requested a private meeting, which he was granted.|$|E

25|$|Papantla is {{the heart}} of Mexico's vanilla-growing region, called Totonacapan and the spice has been grown and trade here since well into the pre-Hispanic period. According to legend. The Totonacs have lived and grown vanilla since they <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> area after the {{downfall}} of Teotihuacan. The origin of the plant is said to have come from the death of two young lovers. The young woman, Tzacopantziza, was the daughter of a king named Tenitztli. She was so beautiful that her father consecrated her to the goddess Tonacayohua so that no mortal man may have her. However, a young prince by the name of Zkatan-Oxga, kidnapped her. This angered the gods and send a monster to terrify the people. The priests found the couple hiding in the mountains and decapitated them both. Where their blood spilled, a plant began to grow, which soon began to give the people their fragrant flowers and seed pods.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture was not viable in the densely forested {{northern}} and central parts of Wisconsin. Settlers <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> region for logging. The timber industry first set {{up along the}} Wisconsin River. Rivers were used to transport lumber from where the wood was being cut, to the sawmills. Sawmills in cities like Wausau and Stevens Point sawed the lumber into boards that were used for construction. The Wolf River also saw considerable logging by industrious Menominee. The Black and Chippewa Rivers formed a third major logging region. That area was dominated by one company owned by Frederick Weyerhaeuser. The construction of railroads allowed loggers to log year round, after rivers froze, and go deeper into the forests to cut down previously unshippable wood supplies. Wood products from Wisconsin's forests such as doors, furniture, beams, shipping boxes, and ships were made in industrial cities with connects to the Wisconsin lumber industry such as Chicago, Milwaukee, Sheboygan, and Manitowoc. Milwaukee and Manitowoc were centers for commercial ship building in Wisconsin. Many cargo ships built in these communities were used to transport lumber from logging ports to major industrial cities. Later a growing paper industry in the Fox River Valley made use of wood pulp from the state's lumber industry.|$|E
