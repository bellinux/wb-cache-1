40|$|The {{corporate}} {{income tax}} in the United States provides only limited tax relief to firms that report tax losses. Firms that have paid positive taxes during the three {{years prior to the}} loss year may "carry back" their losses and receive a tax refund, provided it does not exceed their total taxes in those three years. For some firms, however, current losses exceed potential <b>carrybacks.</b> This may happen when a firm experiences losses in several consecutive years, or when it incurs an especially large loss in a single year. Firms that exhaust their potential <b>carrybacks</b> must carry losses forward, using them to offset future taxable earnings. For these firms, the marginal tax rate on current earnings, as well as the value of tax deductions, depends critically upon when, and if, they regain their taxable status. Firms that anticipate persistent loss car-ryforwards will in effect face very low marginal tax rates.

50|$|Most recently, {{wind energy}} policy has {{continued}} through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5), {{signed into law by}} President Obama. In terms of wind energy, five areas were advanced: 1. an extension was given for the federal production tax credit (PTC) until December 31, 2012; 2. wind energy facilities can make use of an investment tax credit (ITC) for certain property in substitution for PTC; 3. wind projects initiated in 2009 and 2010 can receive a 30% grant from the Treasury Department for the cost of the property; 4. general business credits were modified; 5. the 2009 bonus depreciation was extended. Qualifying for an ITC gives a credit of 30% on the cost of the property used for a wind facility. Cash grants, eliminate the need for a partner to utilize tax credits. The <b>carryback</b> period was extended for the business credit, along with the bonus depreciation. Additional related incentives include 30% investment credits for manufacturers of renewable energy technologies, an increase in new clean renewable energy bonds to finance wind facilities, and funding towards advancing the electrical grid.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} how {{the length of}} the net operating loss <b>carryback</b> period affects corporate liquidity and marginal tax rates. We estimate that extending the <b>carryback</b> period from two to five years, as recently proposed in President Obama’s budget blueprint, would provide $ 19 ($ 34) billion of additional liquidity to the corporate sector for 2008 (2009). Our calculations imply that the benefits of the extended <b>carryback</b> period would be concentrated in the homebuilding, automobile, and financial industries. Extending the <b>carryback</b> period would increase the marginal tax rate of loss firms by more than 200 basis points on average, which all else equal would lead corporations to use an additional $ 8 ($ 10) billion of debt and reduce tax payments by another $ 1. 2 ($ 1. 5) billion in 2008 (2009). Overall, the tax break proposed by the Obama administration would have a significant liquidity effect on corporations suffering large losses in recent years. If the tax proposal were extended to include TARP firms, the liquidity effect would triple in size. ...|$|E
40|$|For {{corporations}} facing tax-function convexity, hedging lowers expected tax liabilities, thereby {{providing an}} incentive to hedge. We use simulation methods to investigate convexity induced by tax-code provisions. On average, the tax function is convex (although in approximately 25 percent of cases it is concave). <b>Carrybacks</b> and carryforwards increase the range of income with incentives to hedge; other tax-code provisions have minor impacts. Among firms facing convex tax functions, average tax savings from a five percent reduction in the volatility of taxable income are about 5. 4 percent of expected tax liabilities; in extreme cases, these savings exceed 40 percent...|$|R
40|$|If {{a company}} faces {{some form of}} tax progressivity-that is, its {{marginal}} tax rate increases over the firm's expected range of reported taxable income-corporate hedging can reduce the firm's expected tax liability by reducing the volatility of pre-tax income. In a study described in this article, the authors used simulation methods to investigate {{the extent to which}} tax progressivity arises from various provisions of the tax code, such as the AMT and tax carryforwards and <b>carrybacks.</b> Based on their analysis of over 80, 000 COMPUSTAT firm-year observations, the authors find that, in about 50 % of the cases, corporations face effective tax functions that exhibit progressivity. The other 50 % of cases are about evenly divided between firms that are tax neutral and those facing tax schedules that are "regressive" (again, over the relevant range of expected reported income). 2000 Morgan Stanley. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} approach to valuing interest tax shields assumes that full tax benefits are realized on every dollar of interest deduction in every scenario. The approach {{presented in this}} paper takes account of the possibility that interest tax shields cannot be used in some scenarios, in part because of variations in the firm's profitability. Because of the dynamic nature of the tax code (e. g., tax-loss <b>carrybacks</b> and carryforwards), it is necessary to consider past and future taxable income when estimating today's effective marginal tax rate. The paper uses a series of numerical examples to show that (1) the incremental value of an extra dollar of interest deduction is equal to the marginal tax rate appropriate for "that dollar"; and (2) a firm's effective marginal tax rate (and therefore the marginal benefit of incremental interest deductions) can actually decline as the firm takes on additional debt. 2001 Morgan Stanley. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{are rapidly}} {{approaching}} {{the time when}} zero <b>carryback</b> will be demanded by the environmentalists and OSHA. The <b>carryback</b> in reference is the fines that cling to the conveyor belt after the belt's cargo has been discharged over the head pulley. Having resisted the centrifugal force to be thrown off with the cargo, these fines are sticky enough {{to remain on the}} belt. As the belt returns to the tail pulley, the idlers that support the belt and the pulleys that bend the belt, dislodge this carried back material, causing it to fall and collect in piles and the very fine particles to become airborne. Recently I visited a plant that had a 42 " wide conveyor belt carrying lignite from storage into the plant. An engineer was assigned to make a study determining if the fugitive material that was creating the "DURT" " problem was coming from the belt, and if it was, what to do about it. He was undecided if it was fugitive because of <b>carryback</b> or because of wind effect as the wind swept across the conveyor. If indeed the problem was from wind effect, a gallery would have to be built to enclose the conveyor. Assisting in this investigation, 1 placed a <b>carryback</b> gauge against the bottom of the return strand of the conveyor belt near the head pulley. This gauge is a measuring device with blades that will scrape a one inch wide area when pressed against the moving belt. Any particles clinging to the belt are scraped off and collected in the container of the device. The <b>carryback</b> gauge was placed against the belt at three different locations across the width of the belt; in the center and 10 inches left and right of center. The removed <b>carryback</b> material was measured. It was found to be an average of. 08 ounces in a 10 second period. The belt was traveling at 592 feet per minute...|$|E
40|$|Midwestern producers, {{especially}} livestock producers, {{may find}} that their projected farm expenses exceed anticipated farm income for the current tax year. These farm losses are likely to cause cash flow difficulties. However, for some producers, farm losses may generate cash inflows {{in the form of}} tax refunds. Tax law allows choices with respect to farm losses. Losses in one tax year may be carried back two years or five years to obtain refunds of taxes previously paid, or losses may be carried forward to offset tax liabilities in future years. Many farmers had high incomes in 2007 and 2008, and carrying back a 2009 loss is likely to generate an income tax refund. If carrying a 2009 loss back two or five years has little or no tax benefit, a producer can elect to carry the loss forward. Therefore, producers with farm losses should analyze their <b>carryback</b> and carryforward alternatives and not just file their current year’s tax return. The farm loss reported on Schedule F (Form 1040) is generally not the same as a net operating loss (NOL) for income tax purposes. The NOL concept is simple, but computation of the NOL deduction and NOL <b>carryback</b> can be quite complex. This complexity arises because various tax benefits must be removed by modifying the deductions of the loss year and modifying the income in the <b>carryback</b> year or years. Similar modifications are made if the loss is carried forward. Because of these modifications, the tax benefits of the loss may be reduced significantly. Before briefly discussing these modifications, this publication addresses some possible los...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{facts on}} the {{importance}} of corporate losses motivate more careful study of the impact of tax incentives for investment on firms that lose money. I model firm investment decisions in a setting featuring financing constraints and <b>carrybacks</b> and carryforwards of operating losses. I estimate investment responses to tax incentives allowing effects to vary with cash flows and taxable status. Results suggest that asymmetries in the corporate tax code could have made recent bonus depreciation tax incentives at most 4 % less effective than they would have been if all firms were fully taxable. Cash flows have more important effects on the impact of tax incentives. Recent declines in cash flows would predict a 24 % decrease in the effectiveness of bonus depreciation. Results thus suggest that tax incentives have the smallest impact on investment exactly when they {{are most likely to be}} put in place [...] during downturns in economic activity when cash flows are low.

40|$|Each {{year the}} federal {{individual}} income tax delivers over 500 {{billion worth of}} incentives intended to encourage socially beneficial activities. Despite their efficiency rationale and substantial price tag, relatively {{little attention has been}} paid to the question of what is the most efficient form for these tax incentives. Currently the vast majority operate through deductions or exclusions, which link the size of the tax benefit to the taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s marginal tax bracket. This Article argues that uniform refundable credits are a more efficient approach for tax incentives intended to correct for positive externalities, absent evidence that externalities or elasticities associated with the subsidized activity vary by income class. This conclusion holds even if no positive externalities are present. Moreover, even when evidence of differences in externalities or elasticities does exist, the most efficient subsidy is almost certainly still some type of refundable credit. The efficiency benefits of refundable credits are further magnified by their tendency to automatically smooth household income and macroeconomic demand. This Article therefore proposes a dramatic change in how the government should provide tax incentives for socially valued activities: the default for all such tax incentives should be a uniform refundable tax credit. This Article also considers the arguments of refundable credit opponents. It concludes that concerns based on administrative and compliance costs are generally overstated. In addition, it finds that the vast majority of those who benefit from current-law refundable credits have positive income tax liability over time. Refundable credits are thus frequently the “rough justice” equivalent of allowing carryovers and <b>carrybacks,</b> which are common in other parts of the tax code. The Article therefore argues that the objection that tax incentives should not be structured as refundable credits because all Americans should pay some income tax is not only conceptually problematic; it is generally empirically unpersuasive on its own terms...|$|R

40|$|The {{spillage}} that accumulates under {{conveyor belt}} lines presents a possible fire and explosion hazard fomiinqjetsoruiel, especially {{to those who}} must clean up the spillage. The U. S.

The amount of material carried back under the conveyor and the wear rates of metal cleaning blades decreased with increasing blade-to-belt pressure to a limiting value, after which the <b>carryback</b> and wear rates remained essentially constant. The optimum blade-to-belt pressure {{was found to be}} 11 to 14 psi for the research conveyor system. Greater pressures increased the blade-belt friction without improving either cleaning or blade life. The modes of blade wear were three-body abrasion and slurry erosion caused by the sand-lime test mixture. Wear rates were reduced by increasing the metal hardness, opti-mizing the pressure, and removing conveyor belt imperfections. Corrosion was not observed to affect the wear of various steels in tests of less than 34 h.

40|$|In {{a recent}} working paper, Plesko (1999) uses {{confidential}} tax return data to evaluate alternative measures of corporate average and marginal tax rates and concludes “The {{results suggest that}} commonly used measures of average tax rates provide little insight about annual corporate tax burdens, and may introduce substantial bias into statistical models. Marginal tax rate proxies perform better, but {{there appears to be}} little, if any, empirical value added by methods that go beyond easily constructed measures traditionally used in the literature. ” I caution readers in accepting the above inferences because of conceptual flaws in Plesko’s evaluation. In evaluating financial statement based average tax rates, Plesko assumes researchers are attempting to estimate statutory tax burdens (tax payable as a percent of taxable income) whereas I would argue that most researchers are attempting to examine a more general concept of corporate tax burdens (tax payable as a percent of book income). Which tax burden is appropriate depends on the research question but Plesko assumes the statutory tax burden is always the appropriate measure. In evaluating financial statement based marginal tax rates, Plesko uses a single period measure which fails {{to take into account the}} effects of <b>carryback</b> and carryforward rules in calculating taxable income.

40|$|This {{testimony}} makes {{three main}} points. First, income volatility, {{especially when it}} involves income declines, imposes significant hardships on American families. It heightens stress about finances and may increase household living expenses. These hardships are most pronounced for middle-and low-income families, whose incomes {{tend to be more}} volatile, and who tend to have less access to low-cost borrowing. Second, currently the income tax system simultaneously helps and hurts families trying to cope with these burdens. It helps in that it softens annual income fluctuations on an after-tax basis by timing tax payments so that a larger share of a family’s income is due in taxes in its higher-income years, and smaller share in its lower-income years. It hurts because over time it imposes higher average tax rates on households with relatively volatile incomes, than it does on others whose income is the same over time but more stable. Finally, it outlines two potential reforms to make the tax system help more and hurt less when a family’s income fluctuates. The first is a limited form of income averaging that would permit taxpayers to elect to <b>carryback</b> unused standard deductions and personal and dependent exemptions for one year, and to average their income over two years when calculating the Earned Income Tax Credit. The second, much broader proposal would involve converting the roughly $ 500 billion per year spent on tax incentives into uniform refundable tax credits. These reforms could be implemented on a revenue-neutral basis. Both would reduce the penalties that the tax system currently imposes on families with volatile incomes, and would provide relief when families need it most – when their income has fallen...|$|E
40|$|When a {{disaster}} strikes the United States, Congress typically feels heavy pressure to enact legislation, including tax legislation, to provide relief. This Article discusses features of two tax legislative initiatives, which responded to two quite different disasters: first, {{the response to}} the devastation of the fall 2005 hurricane season and, then, {{the response to the}} earlier terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon of September 11, 2001. The Article first raises the possibility that some of the provisions of these acts may be vulnerable to indirect constitutional challenge under the Uniformity Clause. In examining some of the problems inherent in post-disaster tax legislation, it discusses the role, usually unfortunate, of sympathy in tax legislation. It goes on to consider how, {{despite the fact that the}} targets of relief legislation are generally thought to be people in need, it nevertheless seems to be the case that a good deal of the benefits of disaster legislation in the tax area goes to relatively high-income and high-wealth taxpayers. It asks whether a better approach can be institutionalized. It suggests that Congress identify those provisions enacted in response to the recent disasters that make sense generally, such as five-year <b>carryback</b> of net operating losses, and amend the tax code to adopt these rules generally. It further recommends that Congress identify those provisions needed in particular when a whole area is devastated-a five-year period for replacing destroyed property, credit for wages to pre-disaster employees, and routine extensions of filing deadlines-and make them available to any declared disaster area. It urges as well two kinds of longer-term approaches. One is to consider and evaluate disaster tax relief provisions as a kind of national insurance against disasters that the private market does not supply. The other is to develop off-the-shelf provisions to be activated when {{a disaster}} strikes...|$|E

40|$|The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) has arguably {{been the}} most {{successful}} government subsidy to finance affordable housing. Since its creation in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 as Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 42, the LIHTC program has helped finance over 1, 670, 000 housing units. LIHTC has endured {{the test of time}} due to its strength both in the public policy and political spheres as well as its effectiveness in attracting significant private capital and in encouraging private oversight. The collapse of corporate earnings in late 2008 led to the subsequent collapse of the LIHTC syndication markets as demand for LIHTCs practically evaporated. Proposed affordable housing developments that anticipated receiving private investment through the sale of LIHTCs stalled. In response to the overall national housing crises, Congress enacted the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA 2008), which contained numerous LIHTC amendments. In early 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), which temporarily converted the LIHTC program into a grant program. While HERA 2008 and ARRA were well intentioned, ARRA is a stopgap measure that could become costly to the US budget. This thesis argues that additional changes to IRC Section 42 should be implemented by Congress in order to reinvigorate the LIHTC syndication markets and improve LIHTC efficiency. This thesis will first provide a detailed, yet comprehensible, background on how the LIHTC functions. (cont.) Armed with that background, the reader will then be introduced to the recent legislation affecting the LIHTC program. Finally, additional changes to the LIHTC will be proposed that, if enacted by Congress, should serve to further strengthen the LIHTC program and help revive affordable housing production. These changes include but are not limited to: expanding the passive investor rules to individuals, permitting LIHTC investors to <b>carryback</b> the LIHTC for five years, amending the LIHTC state allocation formula, accelerating the 10 year credit period, implementing methods to better control development and program costs, and expanding the Community Reinvestment Act. by Jason Korb.
