5000|$|Suntukan {{emphasizes}} {{speed in}} striking, {{with the intent}} of overwhelming the adversary with a flurry of attacks. Indefinite combinations of different strikes are strung together continuously to make successful defense a relative impossibility. Many strikes in suntukan are said to be performed on [...] "half-beats", or in between the major strikes of a <b>combination,</b> so as <b>to</b> disorient and overwhelm an opponent, increasing the opportunity for more devastating attacks. An example of this could be performing a swift slap or eye strike after throwing a jab with the same hand in a standard jab-cross-hook combination; the eye strike both disrupts the defense against and masks the incoming cross. Sometimes, low-line kicks are often executed between boxing <b>combinations</b> <b>to</b> further <b>injure</b> and disorient the opponent.|$|R
