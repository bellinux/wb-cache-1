25|$|Formic acid has low {{toxicity}} (hence its {{use as a}} food additive), with an LD50 of 1.8 g/kg (tested orally on mice). The <b>concentrated</b> <b>acid</b> is corrosive to the skin.|$|E
25|$|Reaction with {{non-metallic}} elements, {{with the}} exceptions of nitrogen, oxygen, noble gases, silicon, and halogens other than iodine, usually oxidizes {{them to their}} highest oxidation states as acids {{with the formation of}} nitrogen dioxide for <b>concentrated</b> <b>acid</b> and nitric oxide for dilute acid.|$|E
25|$|Although {{chromium}} (Cr), iron (Fe), and aluminium (Al) readily dissolve in dilute nitric acid, the <b>concentrated</b> <b>acid</b> forms a metal-oxide layer {{that protects}} {{the bulk of the}} metal from further oxidation. The formation of this protective layer is called passivation. Typical passivation concentrations range from 20% to 50% by volume (see ASTM A967-05). Metals that are passivated by concentrated nitric acid are iron, cobalt, chromium, nickel, and aluminium.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen {{fluoride}} gas is {{an acute}} poison that may immediately and permanently damage lungs and the corneas of the eyes. Aqueous hydrofluoric acid is a contact-poison {{with the potential}} for deep, initially painless burns and ensuing tissue death. By interfering with body calcium metabolism, the <b>concentrated</b> <b>acid</b> may also cause systemic toxicity and eventual cardiac arrest and fatality, after contact with as little as 160cm2 (25 square inches) of skin.|$|E
25|$|On a {{laboratory}} scale, sulfuric acid can be diluted by pouring <b>concentrated</b> <b>acid</b> onto crushed ice made from de-ionized water. The ice melts in an endothermic process while dissolving the acid. The {{amount of heat}} needed to melt the ice in this process {{is greater than the}} amount of heat evolved by dissolving the acid so the solution remains cold. After all the ice has melted, further dilution can take place using water.|$|E
25|$|Gelatin readily dissolves in {{hot water}} and sets to a gel on cooling. When added {{directly}} to cold water, it does not dissolve well, however. Gelatin also is soluble in most polar solvents. Gelatin solutions show viscoelastic flow and streaming birefringence. Solubility {{is determined by the}} method of manufacture. Typically, gelatin can be dispersed in a relatively <b>concentrated</b> <b>acid.</b> Such dispersions are stable for 10–15 days with little or no chemical changes and are suitable for coating purposes or for extrusion into a precipitating bath.|$|E
40|$|Action of bromine in <b>concentrated</b> nitric <b>acid</b> allows {{carrying}} out mono- and polybromination of moderately deactivated aromatic compounds. 4 -Chloronitrobenzene and isophthalic acid turnes into 3 -bromo- 4 -chloronitrobenzene and 5 -bromoisophthalic acid at reaction with bromine in <b>concentrated</b> nitric <b>acid</b> at 20 ˚C whereas in absence of bromine {{in the same}} conditions 4 -chloro- 1, 3 -dinitrobenzene and 5 -nitroisophthalic acid are formed accordingly. Presence of bromine in <b>concentrated</b> nitric <b>acid</b> changes nitrating capacity to brominating one. Terephthalic acid and phthalic anhydride at heating with bromine in <b>concentrated</b> nitric <b>acid</b> can be transformed to appropriating tetrabromo substituted compounds...|$|R

50|$|Silver nitride {{is poorly}} soluble in water, but {{decomposes}} in mineral acids; decomposition is explosive in <b>concentrated</b> <b>acids.</b> It also slowly decomposes in air {{at room temperature}} and explodes upon heating to 165 °C.|$|R
25|$|Sulfuric acid is {{produced}} in the upper atmosphere of Venus by the Sun's photochemical action on carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and water vapor. Ultraviolet photons of wavelengths less than 169nm can photodissociate carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and atomic oxygen. Atomic oxygen is highly reactive. When it reacts with sulfur dioxide, a trace component of the Venusian atmosphere, the result is sulfur trioxide, which can combine with water vapor, another trace component of Venus's atmosphere, to yield sulfuric acid. In the upper, cooler portions of Venus's atmosphere, sulfuric acid exists as a liquid, and thick sulfuric acid clouds completely obscure the planet's surface when viewed from above. The main cloud layer extends from 45–70km above the planet's surface, with thinner hazes extending as low as 30km and as high as 90km above the surface. The permanent Venusian clouds produce a <b>concentrated</b> <b>acid</b> rain, as the clouds in the atmosphere of Earth produce water rain.|$|E
2500|$|Preparation of the {{diluted acid}} can be {{dangerous}} due to the heat released in the dilution process. To avoid splattering, the <b>concentrated</b> <b>acid</b> must be added to water {{and not the other}} way around. [...] Consider of the physical properties of acid and water: ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{theorized that}} in 1952 in London, the {{nitrogen}} dioxide and sulfur dioxide combined with fog rather than humidity; larger droplets of water diluted the acid products, allowing more sulfate production as sulfuric acid. [...] Sunrise burned off the fog, leaving <b>concentrated</b> <b>acid</b> droplets which killed citizens.|$|E
25|$|HI {{can also}} be {{distilled}} from a solution of NaI or other alkali iodide in <b>concentrated</b> phosphoric <b>acid</b> (note that <b>concentrated</b> sulfuric <b>acid</b> will not work for acidifying iodides, as it will oxidize the iodide to elemental iodine).|$|R
500|$|Platinum(IV) oxide, PtO2, {{also known}} as Adams's catalyst, is a black powder that is soluble in KOH {{solutions}} and <b>concentrated</b> <b>acids.</b> PtO2 and the less common PtO both decompose upon heating. Platinum(II,IV) oxide, Pt3O4, is formed in the following reaction: ...|$|R
5000|$|... β-HgS is precipitated as a {{black powder}} when H2S is bubbled through {{solutions}} of Hg(II) salts. β-HgS is unreactive to all but <b>concentrated</b> <b>acids.</b> Mercury metal is produced from the cinnabar ore by roasting in air and condensing the vapour.|$|R
2500|$|Apomorphine (brand names Apokyn, Ixense, Spontane, Uprima) {{is a type}} of aporphine having {{activity}} as a non-selective dopamine agonist which activates both D2-like and, to an order of magnitude lesser extent, D1-like receptors. It also acts as an antagonist of 5-HT2 and α-adrenergic receptors with high affinity. The compound is historically a morphine decomposition product by boiling with <b>concentrated</b> <b>acid,</b> hence the -morphine suffix. Apomorphine does not actually contain morphine or its skeleton, nor does it bind to opioid receptors. The apo- prefix relates to it being a morphine derivative (" [...] from morphine").|$|E
2500|$|Being a {{powerful}} oxidizing agent, nitric acid reacts violently with many non-metallic compounds, and the reactions may be explosive. [...] Depending on the acid concentration, temperature and the reducing agent involved, the end products can be variable. [...] Reaction takes place with all metals except the noble metals series and certain alloys. As a general rule, oxidizing reactions occur primarily with the <b>concentrated</b> <b>acid,</b> favoring {{the formation of}} nitrogen dioxide (NO2). However, the powerful oxidizing properties of nitric acid are thermodynamic in nature, but sometimes its oxidation reactions are rather kinetically non-favored. The presence of small amounts of nitrous acid (HNO2) greatly enhance the rate of reaction.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to electrophilic aromatic addition, resorcinol (and other poly-ols) undergo nucleophilic substitution via the enone form. With <b>concentrated</b> nitric <b>acid,</b> {{in the presence}} of cold <b>concentrated</b> sulfuric <b>acid,</b> it yields trinitro-resorcin (styphnic acid), which forms yellow crystals, exploding violently on rapid heating.|$|R
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of piranha solution in removing organic residues {{is due to}} two distinct processes that operate at noticeably different rates. The first and faster process is removal of hydrogen and oxygen as units of water by the <b>concentrated</b> sulfuric <b>acid.</b> This occurs because hydration of <b>concentrated</b> sulfuric <b>acid</b> is thermodynamically strongly favorable, with a ΔH of −880 kJ/mol. It is this rapid dehydrating property, rather than acidity itself, that makes <b>concentrated</b> sulfuric <b>acid,</b> and so piranha solution, very dangerous to handle.|$|R

50|$|The rapid {{furfural}} test is a chemical test used {{to distinguish between}} glucose and fructose. The rapid {{furfural test}} is similar to Molisch's test but uses <b>concentrated</b> hydrochloric <b>acid</b> instead of <b>concentrated</b> sulfuric <b>acid</b> and the solution is boiled. Dilute sugar solution is added to ethanolic 1-Naphthol and <b>concentrated</b> hydrochloric <b>acid.</b> The solution is then boiled and if a purple colour forms within thirty seconds, fructose is present. If a purple colour doesn't appear before thirty seconds, glucose is present.|$|R

The results showed that treating one-year-old Corchorus tridens seeds with <b>concentrated</b> sulphuric <b>acid</b> (98 %) for 10, 20, and 30 min significantly broke the seed dormancy and promoted the germination of the seeds compared to control seeds (treated with distilled water), hot water treatment, nitric acid (65 %) (seeds treated for 10, 20 and 30 min), gibberellic acid and ethephon. Treating Corchorus seeds with <b>concentrated</b> sulphuric <b>acid</b> for more than 10 min significantly decreased germination capacity. <b>Concentrated</b> nitric <b>acid,</b> gibberellic acid and ethephon {{had no effect on}} the germination capacity of corchorus seed. Simmering hot water also broke seed dormancy of Corchorus tridens seed but was not as effective as <b>concentrated</b> sulphuric <b>acid.</b> The results also showed that Corchorus tridens seed stored for two years lost their viability by up to 91. 5 %. It was concluded that Corchurus tridens seeds from Botswana have hard seed coat or impervious seed coat dormancy but not physiological dormancy as an adaptation to arid and desert conditions...|$|R

50|$|The {{advantages}} to priming are best demonstrated with an example.
