40|$|The fatigue {{behavior}} of a conditioned short glass-fiber reinforced polyamide 6 was studied {{and the effect of}} the cyclic frequency investigated. Load controlled fatigue tests were performed, and the strains and surface temperature of specimens were recorded continuously. The number of cycles to failure was found to be dependent upon cyclic creep rate, as is typical for short glass fiber reinforced polyamides in the conditioned state. A strong reduction of fatigue strength was observed for increasing cyclic load frequency. This was mainly related to the specimen temperature increase due to hysteretic self heating and its effect on the cyclic <b>creep</b> <b>speed.</b> A frequency superposition method is proposed, expressing the relationship between temperature rise, applied stress, and cyclic <b>creep</b> <b>speed</b> in terms of a parameter derived from the Larson–Miller steady creep parameter...|$|E

To determine a preclinical dosage regimen for cimicoxib in dog, a reversible model of kaolin-induced paw inflammation was used. Dosage regimens were established using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling approach (indirect response model). Analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic endpoints investigated with the inflammation model established the efficacy of cimicoxib at a dose of 2 mg/kg administered orally (single dose) in 12 beagle dogs. For both the oral and IV route of administration two groups of dogs to be identified namely Poor Metabolizers (PM) and Extensive Metabolizers (EM). The terminal half-life after oral administration was 8. 0 ± 0. 6 h for the PM and 4. 6 ± 2. 6 h for the EM groups, with the corresponding values after the IV route being 5. 6 ± 1. 7 h and 2. 7 ± 0. 9 h (mean ± SD). The main pharmacodynamic parameters (potency, efficacy, and sensitivity) were estimated for four endpoints (body temperature, <b>creeping</b> <b>speed,</b> ground vertical reaction force and clinical lameness score). The plasma concentration corresponding to half the maximum of the indirect effect were 239 μg/L for <b>creeping</b> <b>speed,</b> 284 μg/L for the lameness score, 161 μg/L for the ground reaction vertical force and 193 μg/L for the body temperature. To document possible polymorphism of the cimicoxib disposition in the target dog population, cimicoxib was administered by the intravenous route to 40 dogs (four different sized breeds). The cimicoxib half-lives in these 40 dogs were of same order of the magnitude as those of the EM beagle dogs. Thus pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters obtained from the EM beagle dogs were selected to simulate the dose-effect relationship of cimicoxib after an oral administration allowing a dosage regimen to be selected for confirmation by a clinical trial Cimicoxib was an efficacious anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic drug and a dosage regimen of 2 mg/kg daily was determined for confirmatory clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|Background: The flower bug Orius sauteri is an {{important}} polyphagous predator that is widely used for the biological control of mites and aphids. However, the optimal conditions for mass rearing of this insect are still unclear, thus limiting its application. Methodology: In this study, we investigated the optimal ingredients of an artificial diet for raising O. sauteri using a microencapsulation technique. The ingredients included egg yolk (vitellus), whole-pupa homogenate of the Tussah silk moth (Antheraea paphia), honey, sucrose, rapeseed (Brassica napus) pollen and sinkaline. We tested 25 combinations of the above ingredients using an orthogonal experimental design. Using statistical analysis, we confirmed the main effect factors amongst the components, and selected five optimal combinations based on different biological and physiological characters. Principal Findings: The results showed that, although different artificial diet formats significantly influenced the development and reproductive ability of O. sauteri, the complete development of O. sauteri to sexual maturity could only be achieved by optimizing the artificial diet according to specific biological characters. In general, pupae of A. paphia had more influence on O sauteri development than did artificial components.

40|$|Recently, a new nonlocal {{granular}} rheology {{was successfully}} {{used to predict}} steady granular flows, including grain-size-dependent shear features, {{in a wide variety}} of flow configurations, including all variations of the split-bottom cell. A related problem in granular flow is that of mechanically-induced creep, in which shear deformation in one region of a granular medium fluidizes its entirety, including regions far from the sheared zone, effectively erasing the yield condition everywhere. This enables creep deformation when a force is applied in the nominally quiescent region through an intruder such as a cylindrical or spherical probe. We show that the nonlocal fluidity model is capable of capturing this phenomenology. Specifically, we explore creep of a circular intruder in a two-dimensional annular Couette cell and show that the model captures all salient features observed in experiments, including both the rate-independent nature of creep for sufficiently slow driving rates and the faster-than-linear increase in the <b>creep</b> <b>speed</b> with the force applied to the intruder...|$|E
40|$|Recent dense {{granular}} flow {{experiments have}} shown that shear deformation in one region of a granular medium fluidizes its entirety, including regions far from the sheared zone, effectively erasing the yield condition everywhere. This enables slow creep deformation to occur when an external {{force is applied to}} a probe in the nominally static regions of the material. The apparent change in rheology induced by far-away motion is termed the “secondary rheology,” and a theoretical rationalization of this phenomenon is needed.

Portions of these curves in the stable crack acceleration region were hence shifted along the da/dt, axis according to a time-temperature reduction scheme, thus allowing the construction of a creep crack propagation master curve.

40|$|Photogrammetric {{measurements}} of geometry, thickness changes and horizontal movements over time periods {{of more than}} 20 years were performed for two rock glaciers in western Svalbard. The results for Brøggerbreen rock glacier revealed no signi cant thickness changes (i. e. < 1 cm a¡ 1) and horizonta l velocities {{in the range of}} a few cm a¡ 1. No signi cant horizontal or vertical changes over the observation period were detected for a rock glacier at Nordenskiöldkysten. A number of observations, however, indicate slow deformation and advance of the body. Under this assumption, the age of the rock glacier can be estimated in the order of 50 ka, which implies potentia l impact on the rock glacier by (de-) glaciations and sea level changes. While rock glaciers on Sval-bard represent creep of cold and continuou s polar permafrost, those in the European Alps are an expression of warm and discon-tinuous mountain permafrost creep. From inter-comparison of the above results with two rock glaciers in the Swiss Alps, we conclude that the observed differences in <b>creep</b> <b>speed</b> and surface micro-topography could, to a large extent, be explained by the substantia l differences in ground thermal regime...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the process}} of the {{continuous}} straightening during continuous casting, elevated temperature creep and stress relaxation are remarkable. During continuous straightening, temperature of steel billet is very high, where the characteristic of deformation is low strain and low strain rate. Experiments of elevated temperature creep, stress relaxation and elevated tension under the conditions of continuous straightening were carried on Gleeble 3500 thermal-mechanical simulation machine and the results indicate that both the <b>creep</b> <b>speed</b> and the stress relaxation speed are very fast in the conditions of continuous straightening. Then metallurgical structures were observed. A lead plate was used to simulate the billet during continuous straightening and then straightening forces were measured. An elasto-viscoplastic model and an elasto-plastic model were built according to the experiment to calculate the straightening forces. The contrast between the calculation results and the measured data shows that ignoring the creep and stress relaxation will result in great errors when calculating the straightening forces in continuous straightening. Carrying researches on elevated temperature creep and stress relaxation and using their characteristics in design has great importance to improve {{the quality and quantity of}} billets in {{the process of}} continuous casting...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Pavement/vehicle {{interaction}} {{is one of}} the growing areas in asphalt pavement design. Traffic volumes have increased considerably over the past few decades, and not only are modern trucks carrying heavier payloads, but they are also using fewer tyres which have higher inflation pressures and hence higher contact stresses than was previously the case. The aim {{of this paper is to}} highlight the variabilities associated with actual measured three-dimensional tyre-pavement contact loading/stress regimes of modern truck tyres. Tyre-pavement contact stress measurements were carried out on a busy national road (N 3) in South Africa from the port of Durban to the inland province of Gauteng. The three-dimensional tyre-pavement contact stress regimes of 45 227 individual tyres were measured using the Stress-In-Motion (SIM) system. In addition, the loading on each tyre was also captured. This measurement series was performed at slow (< 5 km/hr) <b>creep</b> <b>speed</b> conditions at a controlled weigh-bridge as part of the N 3 Traffic Control Centre (N 3 -TCC) near Heidelberg in SA.

40|$|We use a {{piezoelectric}} quartz tuning fork to calibrate {{the displacement of}} ceramic piezoelectric scanners which are widely employed in scanning probe microscopy. We measure the static piezoelectric response of a quartz tuning fork and find it to be highly linear, non-hysteretic and with negligible creep. These performance characteristics, close to those of an ideal transducer, make quartz transducers superior to ceramic piezoelectric actuators. Furthermore, quartz actuators {{in the form of}} a tuning fork have the advantage of yielding static displacements comparable to those of local probe microscope scanners. We use the static displacement of a quartz tuning fork as a reference to calibrate the three axis displacement of a ceramic piezoelectric scanner. Although this calibration technique is a non-traceable method, it can be more versatile than using calibration grids because it enables to characterize the linear and non-linear response of a piezoelectric scanner in a broad range of displacements, spanning from a fraction of a nanometer to hundreds of nanometers. In addition, the <b>creep</b> and the <b>speed</b> dependent piezoelectric response of ceramic scanners can be studied in detail. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the setting of}} power requirements of the steering actuator for an electric demonstration vehicle (EDV). The EDV is a small one-seater vehicle with mass of approximately ~ 400 kg and {{is equipped with a}} steer-by-wire system. The dimensioning of steering systems components other than the steering actuator is not discussed in this report. An analytic method has been developed to estimate maximum expected steering torque in <b>creep</b> and high <b>speed</b> scenarios. Furthermore, the model allows the prediction of suspension geometry influence on steering torque amplitude. The steering effort is analyzed by means of maximum expected tire forces, which are estimated by a simple physical tire model. In the tire model maximum tire-to-ground friction is estimated for various driving scenarios considering the physical limits of the tires. This approach allows the analysis to be performed independent of vehicle motion and without a detailed dynamic car model. The general design of the steer-by-wire system and a steering control setup is presented in order to evaluate the proposed steering system with respect to control time and precision. This is accomplished for a given actuator setup. As major outcome of this work the overall power requirements - such as torque, speed, power and energy demand - of the steering actuator are presented...|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, line locks can be {{installed}} on the rear brake lines. When the line lock is activated, fluid pressure {{is prevented from being}} transferred to the rear, allowing the rear wheels to spin freely while the front brakes can be controlled with the brake pedal. This allows one to <b>creep</b> at varying <b>speeds</b> while maintaining a burnout. Achieving such a burnout requires manipulation of both throttle and brake inputs. The burnout is initiated by manipulating the clutch with the left foot and both the brake and gas pedal with the right foot. The brakes must be held while revving up the engine, then the clutch is released while continuing to hold the brakes. Once the rear tires start spinning, the left foot is used to control the brakes while the right foot continues to control the throttle.The only advantage for such a setup is the ability to maintain a burnout at relatively low wheel low speeds, which reduces wear on the rear tires. This method can be used to increase tire temperature to provide better traction prior to a drag run, but it is also often used purely for show, such as in drifting exhibitions or simply for the personal enjoyment of the driver.Many modern sport-oriented cars now offer optional line locks for drag and show purposes, such as the so-called [...] "burnout mode" [...] found on the 2015 Ford Mustang.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of stacking fault energy during the secondary {{stage of the}} creep process is hard to grasp, both experimentally and theoretically. It is, however, well-known that such an effect is very important; indeed, a weak stacking fault energy is likely to produce a noticeable decreasing in creep rate and lead to a better heat resistance. The numerous attempts at grasping this complex phenomenon have in almost all cases been based on empirical laws which express the creep rate evolution {{as a function of}} temperature (T) and stacking fault energy (γ). The purpose of our study is to assess the {{influence of}} stacking fault energy on Cu (γ= 55 mJ/m 2) and Cu- 4 Si (γ= 25 mJ/m 2) high temperature creep. We try to show that the role of such an energy behaviour law is in accordance with the bibliography results. Several hypotheses have been examined in an attempt to account for the weakness of <b>creep</b> <b>speed</b> values in low stacking fault energies, such as copper and its alloys. On the whole, data analysis proves that copper creep is not controlled by bulk or pipe diffusion but {{is the result of a}} thermally actived slip, probably due to the cross - slip. In the case of Cu- 4 Si, the stacking fault energy represents half of that of Cu, the cross - slip proves to be harder and the creep could be controlled both by diffusion and cross - slip...|$|E

The aim of this work is to study the regularity of relaxation stresses in spring and evaluate its long-term stresses. The work allowed us to establish relaxation dependencies of springs under high temperatures. According to the results of creep tests at 600 °, the theoretical equation of steel creep was defined concretely. It was then used for the analysis at 350 °. The paper presents a created finite element model of spring relaxation. It is the stainless steel 08 Х 18 Н 10 spring to be used at the temperature of 350 °. In this paper describes the basic theory of creep, considers the relationship between the <b>creep</b> <b>speed</b> and parameters. The changing compression force of springs is analyzed under fixed compression amount. The paper also analyzes the changing length of springs in the free state after various stages of high-temperature relaxation test. It determines the results of compression forces and free length under different amount of compression. The analysis to compare the theoretical calculation of the compression forces with the experimental results is conducted. Computer modeling is created in Abaqus for calculation. Spring relaxation experiments are carried out under fixed compression amount and at the temperature of 350 °. It is shown that the simulation results, which are carried out in Abaqus coincide with experimental results. The study shows that it is possible to use the creep equation parameters, based on the experimental results at high temperatures, to predict creep and relaxation properties of springs, which work at less high temperatures. The work results can be used as a basis in designing the springs working at high temperatures. </p...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMany oceanic island rift {{zones are}} {{associated}} with lateral sector collapses, and several models have been proposed to explain this link. The North-East Rift Zone (NERZ) of Tenerife Island, Spain offers an opportunity to explore this relationship, as three successive collapses are located {{on both sides of}} the rift. We have carried out a systematic and detailed mapping campaign on the rift zone, including analysis of about 400 dykes. We recorded dyke morphology, thickness, composition, internal textural features and orientation to provide a catalogue of the characteristics of rift zone dykes. Dykes were intruded along the rift, but also radiate from several nodes along the rift and form en échelon sets along the walls of collapse scars. A striking characteristic of the dykes along the collapse scars is that they dip away from rift or embayment axes and are oblique to the collapse walls. This dyke pattern is consistent with the lateral spreading of the sectors long before the collapse events. The slump sides would create the necessary strike-slip movement to promote en échelon dyke patterns. The spreading flank would probably involve a basal decollement. Lateral flank spreading could have been generated by the intense intrusive activity along the rift but sectorial spreading in turn focused intrusive activity and allowed the development of deep intra-volcanic intrusive complexes. With continued magma supply, spreading caused temporary stabilisation of the rift by reducing slopes and relaxing stress. However, as magmatic intrusion persisted, a critical point was reached, beyond which further intrusion led to large-scale flank failure and sector collapse. During the early stages of growth, the rift could have been influenced by regional stress/strain fields and by pre-existing oceanic structures, but its later and mature development probably depended largely on the local volcanic and magmatic stress/strain fields that are effectively controlled by the rift zone growth, the intrusive complex development, the flank <b>creep,</b> the <b>speed</b> of flank deformation and the associated changes in topography. Using different approaches, a similar rift evolution has been proposed in volcanic oceanic islands elsewhere, showing that this model likely reflects a general and widespread process. This study, however, shows that the idea that dykes orient simply parallel to the rift or to the collapse scar walls is too simple; instead, a dynamic interplay between external factors (e. g. collapse, erosion) and internal forces (e. g. intrusions) is envisaged. This model thus provides a geological framework to understand the evolution of the NERZ and may help to predict developments in similar oceanic volcanoes elsewhere...|$|R
