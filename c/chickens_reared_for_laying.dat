40|$|Clinacox® 0. 5 % is a feed {{additive}} containing 0. 5 % diclazuril {{and is used}} to control coccidiosis in poultry. The previous conclusion on the safety of diclazuril in chickens for fattening at the use level of 1 mg/kg complete feed is extended to <b>chickens</b> <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying.</b> <b>Chickens</b> <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying</b> are in a similar physiological stage as chickens for fattening. The use level proposed for diclazuril in feed {{is the same for}} both categories of birds. Consequently, the metabolic fate and residue status of this additive described for chickens for fattening can be extrapolated to <b>chickens</b> <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying.</b> Feeding diclazuril at 1 mg/kg complete feed to <b>chickens</b> <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying</b> for the first 16 weeks of life would result in negligibly low or absent residues of diclazuril in the first eggs for production. Therefore, maximum residue levels (MRLs) for eggs are not necessary. The previous assessment of consumer safety for the use of diclazuril in chickens for fattening is confirmed and extended to <b>chickens</b> <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying.</b> The same MRLs for tissues as already established can be applied. Clinacox® has a low irritation potential for the eye and skin. Skin sensitisation was not observed. Considering the particle size (particle of respirable size) and dusting potential, exposure by inhalation cannot be excluded, although workers’ exposure has been calculated to be low in comparison with the ADI. In the absence of any data on respiratory toxicity, a hazard from inhalation of dust cannot be entirely excluded and appropriate protective measures should be taken. The use of Clinacox® at 1 mg/kg complete feed does not pose a risk to the terrestrial or aquatic environment. One mg diclazuril/kg complete feed is effective in controlling coccidiosis in <b>chickens</b> <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying...</b>|$|E

This product is authorised for use in chickens for fattening as a zootechnical additive, functional group of digestibility enhancers. The applicant seeks for {{the extension of the}} use of the additive to <b>chickens</b> <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying</b> and to minor poultry species for fattening at a dose range of 50 to 100 alpha-galactosidase units and of 285 to 570 glucanase units per kg feed (corresponding to 50 to 100 mg additive/kg feed). In a previous evaluation the additive was shown to be safe in chickens for fattening at a dose of 100 galactosidase and 570 glucanase units per kg feed. The FEEDAP Panel considers that this conclusion can be extended to <b>chickens</b> <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying.</b> Given the margin of safety established for the major species, these conclusions can be extrapolated to minor poultry species for fattening.

The applicant is now seeking to reduce the minimum authorised dose from 5 x 108 CFU/kg feed to 2. 5 x 108 CFU/kg feed when used with chickens for fattening and all minor avian species (except laying birds) and to extend this authorisation to <b>chickens</b> <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying.</b> The safety for the consumers, users of the product and the environment has been previously assessed by EFSA {{and found that it}} did not raise concerns. In a previous opinion the FEEDAP Panel concluded that the additive is safe for chickens for fattening when used at the then recommended dose. The Panel considers that this conclusion can be extended to <b>chickens</b> <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> <b>laying.</b> This conclusion can be taken to apply to the revised dose for all of species under application. The data from three trials made with chickens for fattening confirmed the effectiveness of the additive when used at the currently authorised dose of 5 x 108 CFU/kg feed. Effects with the reduced dose of 2. 5 x 108 CFU/kg feed were less clear and showed significantly positive results in only two of the five trials in which this dose was tested. However, a meta-analysis made by pooling results from the five trials showed significant gains in final body weight and improved feed conversion indicating that the additive had some potential to improve performance of chickens for fattening at the lower dose.

The metabolic fate of diclazuril in chicken and turkey is qualitatively similar, diclazuril being the marker residue in tissues. At a zero withdrawal time, the theoretical consumer exposure to the total residues from both chickens and turkeys represents about 13 % of the ADI. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel considers that applying a withdrawal period of zero day would not compromise consumer safety.

Such duck meat intended for human consumption has less juiciness, more toughness, less palatability which are the concealed reasons for unacceptability of the duck meat by the consumers, though there is no substantial decline in its nutritive value with escalation in age (De 2001). Comminuted, emulsion type, value added meat products can be prepared from this desi duck meat to enhance their acceptability. Moreover, processing of duck meat is more critical to provide variety of duck meat products to consumer so that demand and marketability can be augmented. Comminuted emulsion products permit inclusion of edible by-products such as skin, gizzard and heart from the spent birds, which would suffice to reduce the cost of the product and improve the yield and quality of finished product.|$|R

Chickens of the 2 ndgroup exhibited more favorable ratio of PUFA n- 6 / PUFA n- 3 in the lipids of breast muscles. The same ratio for the lipids of thigh muscles was better in the 1 stgrou...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: High ambient {{temperature}} {{is one of}} the prominent stressors that elicits low meat quality characteristics in broiler meat. The effect of ascorbic acid supplementation in drinking water on meat quality of broiler <b>chickens</b> <b>reared</b> in closed and open-sided houses during hot ({{ambient temperature}} 36 C) and coolo (ambient temperature 23 C) seasons were studied. Four hundred and thirty two, one-day-old chicks wereo used for each house across the two seasons. Birds were maintained in 23 h light and 1 h dark cycles and offered ad libitum access to water and commercial broiler diets. Broilers in both houses were randomly subjected to four drinking water treatments (9 birds in each 6 replicates/treatment) : 0, 100, 200 and 300 ppm ascorbic acid. Pectoralis muscles were taken at 24 h postmortem and analyzed for ultimate pH, expressed juice, cooking loss, Warner-Bratzler shear force value, myofibril fragmentation index, sarcomere length and colour. Pectoralis muscles collected during the hot season had significantly (p< 0. 05) higher pH, lower expressed juice, darker colour meat (L*) than those collected during cool season group. During the hot season, meat samples from <b>chicken</b> <b>reared</b> in an open-sided house had significantly (p< 0. 0) higher pH and lower lightness value (L*) than those reared in a closed house. Supplementation of drinking water with various levels of ppm ascorbic acid did not significantly improve meat quality characteristics of broiler <b>chicken</b> <b>reared</b> in open-sided or closed housing at high ambient temperatures.

40|$|We {{compared}} Ross <b>chickens</b> <b>reared</b> under broiler and free-range {{conditions to}} see {{whether there was a}} difference in thermal resistance of the plumage. 2. There was no difference in resistance to heat loss attributable to <b>rearing</b> environment <b>for</b> plumage from the back and leg but {{there was a significant difference}} in the pectoral region. 3. Free-range birds had a thicker plumage and a higher total resistance to heat transfer in the pectoral region, despite showing a lower resistance per unit depth than broiler birds. The pectoral plumage was more heavily soiled in broiler birds, which is the most likely explanation for the higher resistance per unit depth. 4. We suggest that behavioural selection of microclimate is likely to be a more important determinant of heat balance in free-range birds than intrinsic plumage adaptations...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{intermittent}} and nearly continuous lighting schedules {{on the performance}} of female broilers were compared in 3 experiments. A step-up program provided 23. 5 h light (L) : 0. 5 h dark (D) from 1 to 7 days, 1 L: 3 D from 8 to 21 days, 1 L: 2 D from 22 to 35 days and 1 L: 1 D from 36 to 48 days. A step-down program provided nearly continuous light from 1 to 7 days, 1 L: 1 D from 8 to 21 days, 1 L: 2 D from 22 to 35 days 1 L: 3 D from 36 to 48 days or 49 days. A constant intermittent lighting program provided 23 L: 1 D from 1 to 7 days and 1 L: 3 D from 8 to 49 days. Nearly continuous light (either 23. 5 L: 0. 5 D or 23 L: 1 D) was used as control treatment in each experiment. Depending on the imposed intermittent lighting program, equal (step-down) or heavier (step-up and 1 L: 3 D) slaughter weights compared with continuous lighting were observed. Cumulative feed intake of <b>chickens</b> <b>reared</b> under the 1 L: 3 D program was lower compared to <b>chickens</b> <b>reared</b> in nearly continuous lighting. In contrast, chickens provided the step-up program consumed significantly more feed compared with <b>chickens</b> <b>reared</b> in nearly continuous lighting or provided with step-down lighting program. Compared with nearly continuous lighting, cumulative feed conversion was significantly improved by imposing the 1 L: 3 D lighting schedule while the opposite was true with the step-up lighting program. Abdominal fat pad content was only significantly increased by imposing the step-up lighting program compared with nearly continuous illumination or with step-down lighting program. When changing from continuous lighting to intermittent lighting at 7 days of age, a transient depression in feed consumption and in body weight gain was observed in all experiments. Subsequently, <b>chickens</b> <b>reared</b> in intermittent lighting manifested compensatory growth so that at the same slaughter age, equal (step-down) or heavier (step-up and 1 L: 3 D) slaughter weights compared with continuous lighting were attained. The catch-up growth of the chickens on the step-down program and on the constant 1 L: 3 D program was also realized with an improved feed conversion but not for chickens on the step-up program. status: publishe...|$|R
