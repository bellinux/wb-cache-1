25|$|For {{super-fast}} trains, {{the second}} digit is always 2 (the first remains 1 or 2), the third digit is the zone, the fourth is the division {{and only the}} last digit is the serial number within the division. Trains travelling in opposite directions along the same route are usually labelled with <b>consecutive</b> <b>numbers.</b> However, there is considerable variation in train numbers and some zones, such as Central Railway, has a less systematic method for numbering trains. Most express trains also have a unique name that is usually exotic and taken from landmarks, famous people, rivers and so on.|$|E
50|$|It was {{the third}} <b>consecutive</b> <b>number</b> one single from Spirits Having Flown, which {{followed}} three <b>consecutive</b> <b>number</b> one singles from their previous album Saturday Night Fever.

40|$|Four rats responded under {{a simple}} fixed <b>consecutive</b> <b>number</b> {{schedule}} in which eight or more consecutive {{responses on the}} run lever, followed by a single response on the reinforcement lever, produced the food reinforcer. Under this simple schedule, dose-response curves were determined for diazepam, morphine, pentobarbital, and phencyclidine. The rats were then trained to respond under a multiple fixed <b>consecutive</b> <b>number</b> schedule in which a discriminative stimulus signaled when the response requirement on the run lever had been completed {{in one of the}} two fixed <b>consecutive</b> <b>number</b> component schedules. Under control conditions, the percentage of reinforced runs under the multiple-schedule component with the discriminative stimulus added was much higher than the percentage of reinforced runs under the multiple-schedule component without the discriminative stimulus. All of the drugs decreased the percentage of reinforced runs under each of the fixed <b>consecutive</b> <b>number</b> schedules by increasing the conditional probability of short run lengths. This effect was most consistently produced by morphine. The drugs produced few differences in responding between the multiple fixed <b>consecutive</b> <b>number</b> components. Responding under the simple fixed <b>consecutive</b> <b>number</b> schedule, however, was affected at lower doses of the drugs than was responding under the same fixed <b>consecutive</b> <b>number</b> schedule when it was a component of the multiple schedule. This result {{may be due to the}} difference in schedule context or, perhaps, to the order of the experiments...|$|R

25|$|The next {{task is to}} form a {{site plan}} and then use it to help decide the method of excavation. Features dug into the natural subsoil are {{normally}} excavated in portions to produce a visible archaeological section for recording. A feature, for example a pit or a ditch, consists of two parts: the cut and the fill. The cut describes {{the edge of the}} feature, where the feature meets the natural soil. It is the feature's boundary. The fill is what the feature is filled with, and will often appear quite distinct from the natural soil. The cut and fill are given <b>consecutive</b> <b>numbers</b> for recording purposes. Scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white and colour photographs of them are taken, and recording sheets are filled in describing the context of each. All this information serves as a permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site.|$|E
25|$|Tait's {{motivation}} {{for studying the}} ménage problem came from {{trying to find a}} complete listing of mathematical knots with a given number of crossings, say n. In Dowker notation for knot diagrams, an early form of which was used by Tait, the 2n points where a knot crosses itself, in consecutive order along the knot, are labeled with the 2n numbers from 1 to 2n. In a reduced diagram, the two labels at a crossing cannot be consecutive, so the set of pairs of labels at each crossing, used in Dowker notation to represent the knot, can be interpreted as a perfect matching in a graph that has a vertex for every number in the range from 1 to 2n and an edge between every pair of numbers that has different parity and are non-consecutive modulo 2n. This graph is formed by removing a Hamiltonian cycle (connecting <b>consecutive</b> <b>numbers)</b> from a complete bipartite graph (connecting all pairs of numbers with different parity), and so it has a number of matchings equal to a ménage number. For alternating knots, this matching is enough to describe the knot diagram itself; for other knots, an additional positive or negative sign needs to be specified for each crossing pair to determine which of the two strands of the crossing lies above the other strand.|$|E

2500|$|However, when {{recurring}} fractions {{do occur}} in duodecimal notation, {{they are less}} likely to have a very short period than in decimal notation, because 12 (twelve) is between two prime numbers, 11 (eleven) and 13 (thirteen), whereas ten is adjacent to the composite number 9. Nonetheless, having a shorter or longer period doesn't help the main inconvenience that one does not get a finite representation for such fractions in the given base (so rounding, which introduces inexactitude, is necessary to handle them in calculations), and overall one is more likely to have to deal with infinite recurring digits when fractions are expressed in decimal than in duodecimal, because one out of every three <b>consecutive</b> <b>numbers</b> contains the prime factor 3 in its factorization, whereas only one out of every five contains the prime factor 5. All other prime factors, except 2, are not shared by either ten or twelve, so they do not ...|$|E
