40|$|International audienceThe conserved {{oligomeric}} Golgi (<b>COG)</b> {{complex is}} a tethering factor composed of eight subunits that {{is involved in}} the retrograde transport of intra-Golgi components. Deficient biosynthesis of <b>COG</b> subunits leads to alterations of protein trafficking along the secretory pathway and thereby to severe diseases in humans. Since the <b>COG</b> complex affects the localization of several Golgi glycosyltransferase enzymes, <b>COG</b> deficiency also leads to defective protein glycosylation, thereby explaining the classification of <b>COG</b> deficiencies as forms of congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG). To date, mutations in <b>COG</b> 1, <b>COG</b> 4, <b>COG</b> 7 and <b>COG</b> 8 genes have been associated with diseases, which range from severe multi-organ disorders to moderate forms of neurological impairment. In the present study, we describe a new type of <b>COG</b> deficiency related to a splicing mutation in the <b>COG</b> 5 gene. Sequence analysis in the patient identified a homozygous intronic substitution (c. 1669 - 15 T>C) leading to exon skipping and severely reduced expression of the <b>COG</b> 5 protein. This defect was associated with a mild psychomotor retardation with delayed motor and language development. Analysis of different serum glycoproteins revealed a CDG phenotype with typical undersialylation of N- and O-glycans. Retrograde Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum trafficking was markedly delayed in the patient's fibroblast upon brefeldin-A treatment, which is a hallmark of <b>COG</b> deficiency. This trafficking delay could be restored to normal values by expressing a wildtype <b>COG</b> 5 cDNA in the patient cells. This case demonstrates that <b>COG</b> deficiency and thereby CDG must be taken into consideration even in children presenting mild neurological impairments...|$|R

40|$|Spatially and {{temporally}} regulated membrane trafficking events incorporate membrane {{and cell}} wall materials into the pollen tube apex and {{are believed to}} underlie the rapid pollen tube growth. In plants, the molecular mechanisms and physiological functions of intra-Golgi transport and Golgi integrity maintenance remain largely unclear. The conserved oligomeric Golgi (<b>COG)</b> complex has been implicated in tethering of retrograde intra-Golgi vesicles in yeast and mammalian cells. Using genetic and cytologic approaches, we demonstrate that T-DNA insertions in Arabidopsis <b>COG</b> complex subunits, <b>COG</b> 3 and <b>COG</b> 8, cause an absolute, male-specific transmission defect that can be complemented by expression of <b>COG</b> 3 and <b>COG</b> 8 from the LAT 52 pollen promoter, respectively.

Within the closed grille there the handsomest of swarthy, black-eyed, black-mustached station-masters (if such was his quality) told us that we could not have a train at once, though we had been advised that any ten of us could any time have a train, because the cars had all gone up the mountain and none would be down for twenty minutes. He spoke English and he mitigated by a most amiable personality sufferings which were perhaps not so great as we would have liked to think. Some of us wandered off down a pink-and-cream colored avenue near by and admired so much the curtains of red-and-yellow flowers--a cross between honeysuckles and trumpet blossoms--overhanging a garden-wall that two friendly boys began to share our interest in them. One of them mounted the other and tore down handfuls of the flowers, which they bestowed upon us with so little apparent expectation of reward that we promptly gave them of the international copper coinage current in Madeira, {{and went back to the}} station doubtless feeling guiltier than they. Had we not been accessory after the fact to something like theft and, as it was Sunday, to Sabbath-breaking besides? Afterward flowers proved so abundant in Madeira in spite of its being winter, that we could not feel the larceny a serious one, and the Sunday was a Latin Sabbath well used to being broken. The pony engine which was to push our slanting car over the <b>cogged</b> track up the mountain arrived with due ceremony of bell and whistle, and we were let through the grille by the station-master as politely as if we had been each his considered guest. Then the climb began through the fields of sugar-cane, terraced vineyards, orchards of fruit trees, and gardens of vegetables planted under the arbors over which the grapes were trained. One of us told the others that the vegetables were sheltered to save them from being scorched by the summer sun, and that much of the work among them was done by moonlight to save the laborers from the same fate. I do not know how he had amassed this knowledge, and I am not sure that I have the right to impart it without his leave. I myself saw some melons lolling on one of the tiled roofs of the cottages where they had perhaps been pushed by the energetic forces of the earth and sky. The grape-vines were quiescent, partly because it was winter, as everybody said, and partly because the wine culture is no longer so profitable in the island.

40|$|In visual search, some {{fixations}} {{are made}} between stimuli on empty regions, {{commonly referred to}} as "centre-of-gravity" fixations (henceforth: <b>COG</b> fixations). Previous studies have shown that observers with task expertise show more <b>COG</b> fixations than novices. This led to the view that <b>COG</b> fixations reflect simultaneous encoding of multiple stimuli, allowing more efficient processing of task-related items. The present study tested whether <b>COG</b> fixations also aid performance in visual search tasks with unfamiliar and abstract stimuli. Moreover, to provide evidence for the multiple-item processing view, we analysed the effects of <b>COG</b> fixations on the number and dwell times of stimulus fixations. The results showed that (1) search efficiency increased with increasing <b>COG</b> fixations even in search for unfamiliar stimuli {{and in the absence of}} special higher-order skills, (2) <b>COG</b> fixations reliably reduced the number of stimulus fixations and their dwell times, indicating processing of multiple distractors, and (3) the proportion of <b>COG</b> fixations was dynamically adapted to potential information gain of <b>COG</b> locations. A second experiment showed that <b>COG</b> fixations are diminished when stimulus positions unpredictably vary across trials. Together, the results support the multiple-item processing view, which has important implications for current theories of visual search...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe <b>COG</b> {{complex is}} a cytosolic heteromeric Golgi complex {{constituted}} of 8 subunits (<b>Cog</b> 1 to <b>Cog</b> 8) {{and involved in}} retrograde vesicular Golgi trafficking. The involvement of this complex in glycosylation and more specifically in Golgi glycosyltransferases localization has been highlighted {{with the discovery of}} <b>COG</b> subunit deficiencies leading to CDG (Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation), a group of inherited disorders of glycosylation. To date, many <b>COG</b> deficient CDG patients have been discovered and this article reviews the birth and rise of this group of defects. The architecture of the <b>COG</b> complex and its cellular functions in Golgi trafficking and Golgi glycosylation are discussed...|$|R
