500|$|When, in 1948 the CGPM {{was charged}} with {{producing}} a coherent system of units of measure, definitions relating to temperature had to be clarified. At the 9th CGPM, the <b>centigrade</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>scale</b> was renamed the Celsius temperature scale and the scale itself was fixed by defining the triple point of water as 0.01°C, though the CGPM left the formal definition of absolute zero until the 10th CGPM when the name [...] "Kelvin" [...] {{was assigned to the}} absolute temperature scale and triple point of water was defined as being 273.16°K. In 1967, at the 13th CGPM the degree Kelvin (°K) was renamed the [...] "kelvin" [...] (K).|$|E
50|$|Celsius (known until 1948 as <b>centigrade)</b> is a <b>temperature</b> <b>scale</b> that {{is named}} after the Swedish {{astronomer}} Anders Celsius (1701 - 1744), who developed a similar <b>temperature</b> <b>scale</b> two years before his death.

2500|$|Since the 19th century, the {{scientific}} and thermometry communities worldwide referred to this scale as the <b>centigrade</b> <b>scale.</b> <b>Temperatures</b> on the <b>centigrade</b> <b>scale</b> were often reported simply as degrees or, when greater specificity was desired, as degrees centigrade (symbol: °C). [...] Because the term centigrade was also the Spanish and French language name for a unit of angular measurement (1/100 of a right angle) and had a similar connotation in other languages, the term centesimal degree (known as the gradian, [...] "grad" [...] or [...] "gon": 1ᵍ = 0.9°, 100ᵍ = 90°) was used when very precise, unambiguous language was required by international standards bodies such as the BIPM. More properly, what was defined as [...] "centigrade" [...] then would now be [...] "hectograde". [...] Furthermore, in the context here, centigrade/hectograde is referring to the whole 0–100 range, not the given part thereof, hence [...] "20° centigrade" [...] means [...] "20ᵍ per 100 gradians" [...] (or 20% hectograde), not its literal description, [...] "0.2 gradians".|$|R
5000|$|... 1744: Coincident {{with the}} death of Anders Celsius, the famous {{botanist}} Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) effectively reversed Celsius's scale upon receipt of his first thermometer featuring a scale where zero represented the melting point of ice and 100 represented water's boiling point. The custom-made linnaeus-thermometer, for use in his greenhouses, was made by Daniel Ekström, Sweden's leading maker of scientific instruments at the time. For the next 204 years, the scientific and thermometry communities worldwide referred to this scale as the <b>centigrade</b> <b>scale.</b> <b>Temperatures</b> on the <b>centigrade</b> <b>scale</b> were often reported simply as degrees or, when greater specificity was desired, degrees centigrade.

The 9th CGPM (General Conference on Weights and Measures (Conférence générale des poids et mesures) and the CIPM (International Committee for Weights and Measures (Comité international des poids et mesures) formally adopted degree Celsius (symbol: °C) in 1948.|$|R

40|$|SummaryThermoTRPs, {{a subset}} of the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) family of cation channels, have been implicated in sensing temperature. TRPM 8 and TRPA 1 are both {{activated}} by cooling; however, it is unclear whether either ion channel is required for thermosensation in vivo. We show that mice lacking TRPM 8 have severe behavioral deficits in response to cold stimuli. In thermotaxis assays of temperature gradient and two-temperature choice assays, TRPM 8 -deficient mice exhibit strikingly reduced avoidance of cold temperatures. TRPM 8 -deficient mice also lack behavioral response to cold-inducing icilin application and display an attenuated response to acetone, an unpleasant cold stimulus. However, TRPM 8 -deficient mice have normal nociceptive-like responses to subzero <b>centigrade</b> <b>temperatures,</b> suggesting the presence of at least one additional noxious cold receptor. Finally, we show that TRPM 8 mediates the analgesic effect of moderate cooling after administration of formalin, a painful stimulus. Therefore, depending on context, TRPM 8 contributes to sensing unpleasant cold stimuli or mediating the effects of cold analgesia...|$|R
