2500|$|Because plug-in {{electric}} vehicles {{do not produce}} emissions {{at the point of}} operation are often perceived as being environmentally friendlier than vehicles driven through internal combustion. [...] Assessing the validity of that perception is difficult due to the greenhouse gases generated by the power plants that provide the electricity to charge the vehicles' batteries.

2500|$|With his translations, Smith goes {{to great}} lengths to {{preserve}} the experience of the original text as much as possible, especially if it has a distinct feel. For The Devotion of Suspect X, he mirrored Higashino's [...] "sparse, methodical tone of Japanese" [...] by using more elevated and formal language. He draws on his academic background in classical Japanese literature to inform some of these translations. When it comes to the question of leaving Japan-specific terms untranslated, Smith is careful to either translate around it or provide a <b>concise</b> <b>description</b> of the term. He only resorts to leaving a word in Japanese in rare, plot-critical cases, such as with a kotatsu used as a murder weapon in The Devotion of Suspect X, stating [...] "Nothing kills the flow of a text more than a long-winded explanation of something which would have come second nature to a reader of the original [...] ". For less [...] "literary" [...] mediums like manga and games, Smith feels more free to maximize the audience's enjoyment if a strict literal translation that adheres to the original sentence structure would impede that enjoyment.|$|E

40|$|In many {{applications}} of OLAP or data warehouse, users need to query data of interest, {{such as a}} set of data that satisfies specific properties. A normal answer to such query just enumerates all the interesting cells. This is the most accurate but not the most informative method. Summarizations need to be done in order to return more <b>concise</b> <b>descriptions</b> of these interesting cells to the users. MDL approach has been applied on the hierarchical data to get <b>concise</b> <b>descriptions.</b> However in many cases the <b>descriptions</b> are not <b>concise</b> enough to the users. Another method, GMDL, can generate much shorter descriptions, but the GMDL descriptions are not truly pure. The motivation of our research is to overcome the disadvantages in the above methods. In this thesis, we bring up a methodology that focuses on generating the summarization with exceptions of the hierarchical data. We extend the MDL approach to include some exceptions in the description. The exceptios are some uninteresting cells. The result shows that the description with exceptions is pure, which means that the description only covers “interesting cells”. We call this new approach MDLE, i. e. MDL with exceptions. Our new approach aims to find the shortest description with exceptions to cover all “interesting cells”. Firstly, we study two simple cases that can be solved in polynomial time and we give the algorithms. Secondly, we prove that MDL with exceptions is an NP-Hard problem in general cases and we propose three heuristics. Finally, we show some experiments that we have done to compare MDLE with MDL and GMDL. The experiment results show that MDLE generates more <b>concise</b> <b>descriptions</b> than MDL and meantime MDLE gets shorter descriptions than GMDL when the white-ratio is low or there are some red cells. ii Contents i...|$|R
