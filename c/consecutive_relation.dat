40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} our study {{consists}} in the research of new ways of designing reinforced concrete structures submitted to commercial aircraft impact. We will particularly focus on shaking resulting from such load case. The cutoff frequency {{of this kind of}} stress is within the range of 40 to 100 Hz which should correspond to medium frequency [1]. Therefore, industrial structure design implies dynamic studies. The response, especially during the transient stage, cannot be completely described using classical finite element method associated with explicit numerical schemes. Indeed, the medium frequency range is often ignored unless the calculation is carried out with a very refined mesh and consequently, a refined time discretization. This would lead to a prohibitive computation time. The linear behaviour is not questioned outside the impact area, however, the non-linearity of the portion of the impacted structure can have a significant influence. A new multiscale computational strategy, the Variational Theory of Complex Rays [2], is developed for the analysis of the vibration of structures in the medium frequency regime. Using two-scale shape functions which verify the dynamic equation and the <b>consecutive</b> <b>relation</b> within each substructure, the VTCR {{can be viewed as a}} means of expressing the power balance at the different interfaces between substructures in variational form. The solution is searched as a combination of propagative and evanescent waves. Only the amplitude of these waves, which are slowly varying quantities of the solution, are discretized. This leads to a numerical model with few degrees of freedom in comparison with a Finite Element model. The method consists in an initial decomposition FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) of the signal loading. The VTCR ensures the transfer of the decomposed signal into the structure. The obtained signals are then processed by inverse FFT (IFFT) to reconstruct a time signal and a response spectrum [3]. The aim is to develop a robust method to get mid-frequency spectra generated by an aircraft impact on a simplified containment [4].

The incidence of PTDM was evaluated in 538 <b>consecutive</b> KTx in <b>relation</b> to their baseline immunosuppression. PTDM was defined according to the 2003 American Diabetes Association and World Health Organization experts committee definition. As risk factors for PTDM development were considered: age, family history of diabetes, body mass index (BMI), baseline immunosuppression, doses and blood levels of the immunosuppressive agents used. Baseline immunosuppression consisted of CSA, TAC and SRL + CNI. Thirty-two pair-matched controls were identified among the 538 KTx and included in the risk analysis. Significant risk factors for the development of PTDM were identified in the family history of diabetes (P < 0. 02) and BMI (P < 0. 05). Higher BMI and positive family history for diabetes mellitus were significant risk factors for the development of PTDM, regardless of the immunosuppressive agent used...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to explore}} the complex role of <b>consecutive</b> interpreters in <b>relation</b> to context. Context shapes how interpreters are {{positioned}} within an interaction, conceived of as a multi-level framework comprising the textual level, the interactional level, and the institutional level. The empirical focus is interpreting in seminars run by a Turkish public institution and supported by an international organization {{in the framework of}} the country’s development towards EU accession. The case study relies on the triangulation of several types of data, different research methods and settings in order to provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} interpreter’s role in context. In accordance with the fieldwork strategy, the focus is on naturally occurring data, including user and interpreter surveys, interviews, and video-recordings of interpreted interactions. The findings of the study reveal that there may be a gap between the general role definitions of interpreters and the strategies they are expected to adopt. User expectations vary depending on situational factors and the role perceptions of interpreters do not necessarily match reality. The analysis of the interpreter’s role in two different events exhibiting a varying degree of formality and interactivity but sharing the same institutional context, interpreting mode, and interpreter, demonstrates the influence of context on the interpreter’s role...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to report the {{surgical}} experiences and to evaluate the effectiveness of Two-stage operation (including 1 -anterior release and fusion with hylofemoral traction and 2 -posterior correction and fusion) in scoliosis. The prospective study was performed on 45 scoliotic patients presenting to Tabriz Shohada Orthopedics Teaching Referral Hospital between January 2002 and July 2007. Two-stage operation (anterior release and fusion with hylofemoral traction followed by posterior correction and fusion) was performed for cases in which the scoliosis angle was > 70 ° and the correction level on bending films was less than 50 %. Forty five patients, 32 (71. 1 %) female and 13 (28. 9 %) male, with mean age of 15. 13 ± 0. 34 years (range of 10 to 18 years), were studied. According to the <b>consecutive</b> sampling, the <b>relation</b> of scoliosis with patients sex was significant (p< 0. 005). The mean scoliosis angle was 73. 31 ± 4. 21 before operation and 36. 11 ± 2. 56 after operation (p< 0. 005).

The authors conducted a population-based case-control study using 1992 – 1998 Washington State birth certificate and hospital discharge records to investigate this <b>relation.</b> <b>Consecutive</b> cases of pregnancy-induced hypertension were divided into four groups based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes: eclampsia (n = 154), severe preeclampsia (n = 1, 180), mild preeclampsia (n = 5, 468), and gestational hypertension (n = 8, 943). Cases were compared with controls {{who did not have}} pregnancy-induced hypertension (n = 47, 237). Gestational diabetes was more common in each case group (3. 9 % in eclamptics, 4. 5 % in severe preeclamptics, and 4. 4 % in both mild preeclamptics and those with gestational hypertension) than in controls (2. 7 %). After adjustment for body mass index, age, ethnicity, parity, and prenatal care, gestational diabetes was associated with increased risk of severe preeclampsia (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 5, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 1, 2. 1), mild preeclampsia (OR = 1. 5, 95 % CI: 1. 3, 1. 8), and gestational hypertension (OR = 1. 4, 95 % CI: 1. 2, 1. 6). Gestational diabetes was more strongly associated with pregnancy-induced hypertension among women who received less prenatal care (OR = 4. 2 for eclampsia and OR = 3. 1 for severe preeclampsia, p < 0. 05 for both) and among Black women (OR for eclampsia and preeclampsia together = 3. 9, p < 0. 05). diabetes, gestational; eclampsia; ethnic groups; hypertension; pre-eclampsia; pregnancy complications...|$|R

The study was a descriptive and non-experimental design. The microscopic observation and counting was done in ten <b>consecutive</b> fields in <b>relation</b> to 40 X and stool weight in grams. We found 77 % of samples positive for Blastocystis sp, 52 % from patients with symptoms such as flatulence 6 (24 %), abdominal pain 5 (20 %), nausea 2 (8 %), diarrhea 6 (24 %) and constipation 6 (24 %). The ranges of parasites per field more frequent in symptomatic patients were 0 - 3 (74 %) and 7 - 10 (26 %); and in the asymptomatic group 100 % of the patients were in the 0 - 3 range. In the 0 - 3 range asymptomatic patients had a lower number of parasites per gram of feces, while in the 7 - 10 range high parasite loads were observed only in symptomatic patients. Less granular forms in relation to vacuolar ones were found in both groups, in the 0 - 3 range of the symptomatic group, 85 % vacuolar and 15 % granular, and 76 % vacuolar, and 24 % granular in the asymptomatic. In conclusion, the study of the morphologies, the quantification of differential forms by field and the quantification of the number of parasites per field contributes to the technical optimization of routine coproparasitolog...|$|R

But they read them with different feelings. They were thunderstruck. Fyne had to explain the full purport of the intelligence to Mrs Fyne whose first cry was that of relief. Then that poor child would be safe from these designing, horrid people. Mrs Fyne did not know what it might mean to be suddenly reduced from riches to absolute penury. Fyne with his masculine imagination was less inclined to rejoice extravagantly at the girl's escape from the moral dangers which had been menacing her defenceless existence. It was a confoundedly big price to pay. What an unfortunate little thing she was! `We might be able to do something to comfort that poor child at any rate for the time she is here,' said Mrs Fyne.

But no comfort for anyone could be got by rushing out into the street at this early hour; and so, following the advice of Fyne not to act nastily, they both sat down at the window and stared feelingly at the great house, awful to their eyes in its stolid, prosperous, expensive respectability with ruin absolutely standing at the door." ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine {{variations}} in measures of body composition in elite soccer players. Skinfolds and measures of body mass (BM) recorded on a monthly basis across an entire competitive season in a group of senior professional players (n = 26) were used to estimate percentage body fat (%BF) and provide fat-free body mass (FFBM) values. Mean values in players were compared between 6 specific positional roles (goalkeepers, central and lateral defenders/midfielders and center-forwards). In-season variations in measures were studied by comparing values at 5 separate points across the season. The effects of positional group (goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders, and forwards) and exposure time to play (participation time in training and matches) in relation to in-season variations were also examined. To investigate interseasonal changes, repeated measures were taken in players (n = 9) over 3 <b>consecutive</b> seasons. In <b>relation</b> to positional role, a difference in average %BF and BM values was observed (p < 0. 001), with substantial differences observed in goalkeepers, lateral midfielders, and forwards. Across all players, there were significant in-season variations in %BF (between start- and mid-season and mid- and end-season, p < 0. 001) and FFBM (between start- and mid-season and start- and end-season, p < 0. 001), whereas BM remained unchanged. Further analysis of these fluctuations in %BF and FFBM at different points of the season showed that variations differed across the positional groups (p < 0. 01), especially in defenders and midfielders. In contrast, no association was observed between measures and exposure time and no differences were reported across seasons. Practitioners should consider individual positional role when interpreting mean body composition data. They should also take into account positional groups when in-season variations in body composition are identified...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{bilingualism}} on cognitive {{development has been}} a matter of interest for many scholars, as well as a source of debate, partly becau se results from different studies have led to different and even conflic ting conclusions. Although some studies have obtained evidence for a bil ingual superiority in metalinguistic awareness and mental flexibility, o thers have failed to replicate these results. To explain the discrepanci es, {{it has been argued that}} attaining a high level of proficiency in bot h languages may be necessary to experience long-term cognitive benefits. Moreover, the bilingual advantage has been confined to tasks that requi re high levels of cognitive control in both linguistic and non-linguisti c domains. The prevailing interpretation has attributed the processing a dvantage in bilinguals to an enhanced development of executive functions stemming from the necessity to manage two activated languages. Bilingua ls need a controlled-attention mechanism to manage their two linguistic systems, by selectively attending to the required system while ignoring the other. In addition, the constant need to shift attention between lan guages in order to adequately respond to situational demands implies rap id monitoring and efficient switching of representations. Management of the competing linguistic representations therefore requires the involvem ent of multiple cognitive processes such as attention, inhibition, monit oring, and switching. Thus, the need to constantly use these processes m odifies the development or operation of executive functions for bilingua ls. The current study sought to analyze the association between bilingualism and executive control. The specific aims were a) to explore the advanta ges derived from learning and using two languages habitually, and b) to determine the cognitive processes and mechanisms involved in the so-call ed bilingual effect. In Study 1, the expected bilingual advantage on c ognitive control was tested by comparing the performance of second- and fourth-grade monolingual and bilingual children on metalinguistic awaren ess and executive functioning tasks requiring inhibition, switching, and updating. Study 2 aimed to further investigate executive control in a b roader age range of bilingual children by examining metalinguistic contr ol, inhibitory control processes (response suppression, interference con trol and cognitive inhibition), and switching of mental representations. Finally, Study 3 examined the effect of relative proficiency in both la nguages (balanced and unbalanced bilinguals) and language exposure (simu ltaneous and <b>consecutive)</b> on the <b>relation</b> between bilingualism and execu tive control. Results provided partial evidence in favor of an enhanced control of pro cessing for bilingual children, both in terms of control of linguistic p rocessing as well as control of interference from competing or distracti ng cues. The bilingual advantage on cognitive control was, however, not obtained consistently in the three studies, and, when present, differenc es were rather small. Moreover, enhancement of executive control was res tricted to simultaneous and balanced bilinguals. Finally, advantages for bilinguals were observed only in young children, with differences betwe en bilinguals and monolinguals tending to decrease as a function of age. Results from this research must be considered in the context of a large body of evidence suggesting a reliable positive association between bil ingualism and the development of executive control. Nevertheless, they s erve as a reminder that the mechanism by which the bilingual advantage e merges needs to be further clarified. Most noteworthy, these results hig hlight the importance of examining the effects of bilingualism character istics (such as relative proficiency and language exposure), and age whe n studying the relationship between bilingualism and executive functions. status: publishe...|$|R
