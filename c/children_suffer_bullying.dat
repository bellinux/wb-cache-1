The National Grammar Schools Association suggest that the ethos of a grammar school could foster a culture high of attainment.|$|R
40|$|Bullying is a {{widespread}} social phenomenon. We show that both children who are being bullied and <b>children</b> who <b>bully</b> <b>suffer</b> in terms of long-term outcomes.

Evidence {{from a number of}} identification strategies suggests that the relationship is causal. Besides the direct effect bullying may have on the child in the longer run, we show that an additional mechanism can arise through teacher perceptions of short-run abilities and behavior...|$|R
