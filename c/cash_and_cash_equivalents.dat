25|$|Schur {{found himself}} lonely after {{the flight of}} many of his {{students}} and the expulsion of renowned scientists from his previous place of work. Only Dr. Helmut Grunsky had been friendly to him, as Schur reported in the late thirties to his expatriate student Max Menachem Schiffer. The Gestapo was everywhere. Since Schur had announced to his wife his intentions to commit suicide in case of a summons to the Gestapo, in the summer of 1938 his wife took his letters, and with them a summons from the Gestapo, sent Issai Schur to a relaxing stay in a home outside of Berlin and went with medical certificate allowing her to meet the Gestapo in place of her husband. There they flatly asked why they were still staying in Germany. But there were economic obstacles to the planned emigration : Emigrating Germans had a pre-departure Reich Flight Tax to pay, which was a quarter of their assets. Now Schur's wife had inherited a mortgage on a house in Lithuania, which because of the Lithuanian foreign exchange determination could not be repaid. On the other hand, Schur was forbidden to default or leave the mortgage to the German Reich. Thus the Schurs lacked <b>cash</b> <b>and</b> <b>cash</b> <b>equivalents.</b> Finally, the missing sum of money was somehow supplied, and to this day {{it does not seem to}} be clear who were the donors.|$|E

40|$|Research on {{the common}} {{characteristics}} of firms in financial distress into bankruptcy or recovery This paper uses the Cox regression model in survival analysis to investigate whether factors that affect the financial distress among listed and OTC (over-the-counter) firms in the emerging Taiwan market will continue to influence the probability of bankruptcy/delisting or recovery. The {{results show that the}} variables of liquidity, profitability, capital structure and corporate governance have significant differences in their level of influences among the three models. When <b>cash</b> <b>and</b> <b>cash</b> <b>equivalent</b> holdings are lower, the ratio of independent directors is lower, the control rights deviation level is smaller, the company is not a family-owned business, and then the probability of financial distress is higher. A high debt level increases the chance of bankruptcy/delisting. In the case of higher outsider shareholdings or more control rights deviation, the probability of bankruptcy/delisting or recovery is lower. More excess cash does not necessarily help the firm resume operations. The average stock returns of recovered firms significantly outperform the market index in the following two years. Industry classification and being a family-owned business have no influence on the chance of bankruptcy/delisting or on that of recovery. Moreover, the period from the occurrence of financial distress to the bankruptcy/delisting (to recovery) is about 18 (23) months...|$|R

40|$|Based on a {{theoretically}} correct model {{we examine}} the value the market assigns to different components of the cash flow to equity including “potential” dividends. We study publicly traded firms from five Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru during the period 1991 - 2007. The model includes the following variables: market value of equity, dividends paid, change in equity investment <b>and</b> change in <b>cash</b> <b>and</b> <b>cash</b> <b>equivalent</b> holdings (“potential” dividends). These variables are regressed with actual equity value as dependent variable and the other variables as independent variables (including equity value for next period). We tested the data applying Ordinary Least Squares OLS, and Data Panel. Both tests give consistent results. The contribution of this work is double: First, against current findings, {{we find that the}} market assigns less than one dollar to a future dollar for any of the variables studied as expected when we interpret the coefficient of the variables as discount factors. Second, in particular, we found that “potential” dividends (change in liquid assets) destroy value. This means that the value today of a dollar in t+ 1 is negative. This conclusion confirms the problem of agency costs of keeping undistributed <b>cash</b> flows <b>and</b> that they should not be included in the cash flows while listed in the Balance Sheet. The {{solution to the problem of}} destroying value is not inflating the cash flows, but making decisions to effectively distribute the excess cash. ...|$|R
5000|$|Restricted cash is {{the amount}} of <b>cash</b> <b>and</b> <b>cash</b> <b>equivalent</b> items which are {{restricted}} for withdrawal and usage. The restrictions might include legally restricted deposits, which are held as compensating balances against short-term borrowings, contacts entered into with others or entity statements of intention with regard to specific deposits; nevertheless, time deposits and short-term certificates of deposit are excluded from legally restricted deposits. Restricted cash can be also set aside for other purposes such as expansion of the entity, dividend funds or [...] "retirement of long-term debt". Depending on its immateriality or materiality, restricted cash may be recorded as [...] "cash" [...] in the financial statement or it might be classified based on the date of availability disbursements.Moreover, if cash is expected to be used within one year after the balance sheet date it can be classified as [...] "current asset", but in {{a longer period of time}} it is mentioned as non- current asset. For example, a large machine manufacturing company receives an advance payment (deposit) from its customer for a machine that should be produced and shipped to another country within 2 months. Based on the customer contract the manufacturer should put the deposit into separate bank account and not withdraw or use the money until the equipment is shipped and delivered. This is a restricted cash, since manufacturer has the deposit, but he can not use it for operations until the equipment is shipped.|$|R

Treasury is also an essential and main restriction of the financial management of the enterprise. Treasury embodies the results of operations and how to achieve financial balance of compliance. Not always an entity that ends year with benefits, has a positive <b>cash</b> (<b>cash</b> at bank <b>and</b> in availability). And this, because the gap between the recording and accounting of revenue and expenditure receipts and payments as they fall due, that gap can be decisive for the fate of the enterprise. This is a major requirement of the accrual.

40|$|The Austrian economists {{hold that}} {{the so called}} true money supply is theoreticaly {{superior}} to the classical M 1, M 2 and M 3. Using {{the data from the}} Czech Republic I verify in my thesis whether it really could be the case. The true money supply is the sum of the amount of <b>cash</b> <b>and</b> goods (<b>cash</b> <b>equivalents)</b> which could be redeemed during a period not exceeding the horizon specified at a fixed rate known in advance in cash. In addition, most market participants have to think that the amount of cash available for the purpose of such exchange is unlimited. Several true money supplies, that differ in the horizons of the included <b>cash</b> <b>equivalents,</b> are constructed based on the Czech National Bank (ČNB) data spanning the years from 2002 to 2012. For the comparison of the true money supplies and the M an elementary model is used based on the equation of exchange. The main finding is that the indicators don't considerably differ. Thus it seems that the true money supplies and M are practically the same. For all the indicators, however, the estimates of the coefficient of the model are significantly different from the quantitative theory of money predictions. That's why the results are to be interpreted with caution...|$|R

The financial crisis highlighted the risks and complexity of a leverage web that includes flesh-and-blood {{people from all walks}} of life and paper people from all corners of the business and investment world. In the tax area, the potentially problematic incentive effects of interest deductibility have long engaged a wide array of tax commentators and policymakers. While interest deductibility rightly receives widespread scrutiny, a more comprehensive approach to leverage is needed. This Article focuses on the surprisingly complicated tax treatment of <b>cash</b> (<b>and</b> <b>cash</b> <b>equivalent)</b> borrowings. This Article highlights that the current tax treatment of debt principal used to finance business and investment deductions yields favorable tax timing mismatches for taxpayers and thereby theoretically amplifies any distortions caused by the deductibility of debt interest. The tax system’s current approach to debt-financed tax benefits reflects reactive responses to particular forms of tax avoidance. The current system’s reliance on a factor drawn from tax avoidance case law— likelihood of repayment—has led to an inherently flawed set of tax rules. For example, the at-risk rules identify nonrecourse debt as problematic and then impose timing limitations on tax benefits financed only with that debt type even though potential timing distortions are embedded in all cash borrowings. Thus, the at-risk rules treat nonrecourse debt as simultaneously bona fide and suspect, yet whether an agreement constitutes bona fide debt still must be determined using a facts-andcircumstances, case-by-case analysis. The resulting tax rules relating directly to debt principal are confusing and inconsistent. The rules also invite extensive tax planning, whether legitimate or avoidant. The main tax problems relating to debt principal—the timing distortion and the possibility of sham debt—should be addressed as distinct issues with priority given to the timing issue. Giving renewed attention to resolving the timing distortion would facilitate a comprehensive approach to debt and would also have the likely side benefit of making sham debt less attractive. This Article examines multiple proposals for directly limiting timing benefits. Solving timing distortions for even simple cash debt is quite difficult. Thus, this Article details a more accurate, more complex reform avenue but also suggests a simpler, rougher justice one as well. The more complex approach rations the use of borrowed basis while the simpler approach utilizes a deferral charge. In addition, this Article briefly reviews (and rejects) two other possibilities—treating all debt as lacking basis <b>and</b> treating <b>cash</b> <b>equivalent</b> debt as income on receipt. If it is not currently possible to implement broader reform proposals, incremental reform that distinguishes more carefully between the underlying timing distortion and tax avoidance behavior could bring greater coherence to the taxing problem of debt principal...|$|R
