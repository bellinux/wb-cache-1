40|$|The {{role of the}} {{terminal}} and axillary buds, as presumptive organs of gibberellin synthesis, in the control of tuberization in potato (Solanum tuberosum L., cv. Sebago) at high temperatures was studied. Decapitation alone strongly promoted the outgrowth of axillary buds, but did not promote tubenzation. When growth of the axillary buds was suppressed {{by the use of}} <b>chemical</b> <b>pruning</b> agents (MH, TIBA or 1 -decanol), tuberization was promoted. Manual removal of the buds promoted tuberization to a similar extent. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the buds are major sites of gibberellin synthesis in the potato, and that high temperatures stimulate the synthesis of gibberellins and their export to the stolons, where they inhibit tuber formation...|$|E
40|$|A {{mechanical}} pruner serves for pruning new hopvine shoots in spring. The later yield {{depends on}} the right timing and quality of pruning. That is why hop pruning {{is one of the}} most important agrotechnical procedures. A double-disc mechanical pruner used on high trellises cannot be used on low trellises due to its large size. Abroad, for pruning hops on low trellises a specially adapted sprinkler is used (<b>chemical</b> <b>pruning).</b> With regard to the effort to minimize the chemical environmental burden, we opted for the design of the mechanical pruner. Firstly, the low trellis, mechanical pruner, and also elements used in the design of hydraulic circuit are described. Next part of the paper is devoted to the input requirements for both the hydraulic circuit and the mechanical pruner designs. Then a description of an adapted inter-axle carrier used for the experimental model of the hop mechanical pruner and of the effected field measurement follows, along with interpretation of the measured data. These data are depicted in clearly arranged graphs showing the dependency of pressure and hydraulic oil flow on the cutting disc rotational frequency...|$|E
40|$|Protection of wounds against {{infection}} by trunk disease pathogens is {{the most}} efficient and cost-effective means to prevent grapevine trunk diseases. Studies done to determine the effectiveness of <b>chemical</b> <b>pruning</b> wound protectants have mostly focused on the control of Eutypa lata. However, other important wound pathogens, such as Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, Phaeoacremonium spp., Phomopsis spp. and species of Botryosphaeriaceae (including Botryosphaeria and aggregate genera), pose just as significant a threat to sustainable grape production. Fungicide sensitivity {{studies have been conducted}} for Pa. chlamydospora, P. viticola and E. lata. However, no such studies have been conducted for the pathogenic species of Botryosphaeriaceae from grapevines in South Africa. Ten fungicides were, therefore, tested in vitro for their efficacy on mycelial inhibition of the four most common or pathogenic species of Botryosphaeriaceae in South Africa, 'B. ' obtusa, Neofusicoccum australe, N. parvum and Lasiodiplodia theobromae. Iprodione, pyrimethanil, copper ammonium acetate, kresoxim-methyl and boscalid were ineffective in inhibiting the mycelial growth at the highest concentrations tested (20 mu g/mL for copper ammonium acetate, 5 mu g/mL for other agents tested). Benomyl, tebuconazole, prochloraz manganese chloride and flusilazole were the most effective fungicides with EC 50 values for the different species ranging from 0. 36 - 0. 55, 0. 07 - 0. 17, 0. 07 - 1. 15 and 0. 04 - 0. 36 mu g/mL, respectively. These fungicides, except prochloraz manganese chloride, are registered for use on grapes in South Africa and were also reported to be effective against Pa. chlamydospora, P. viticola and E. lata. Results from bioassays on 1 -year-old Chenin Blanc grapevine shoots indicated that benomyl, tebuconazole and prochloraz manganese chloride were most effective in limiting lesion length in pruning wounds that were inoculated with species of Botryosphaeriaceae after fungicide treatment. The bioassay findings were, however, inconclusive due to low and varied re-isolation incidences. Benomyl, tebuconazole, prochloraz manganese chloride and flusilazole can be identified as fungicides to be evaluated as pruning wound protectants in additional bioassays and vineyard trials against species of Botryosphaeriaceae {{as well as the other}} grapevine trunk disease pathogens...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. <b>Chemical</b> root <b>pruning</b> studies were carried out on greenhouse grown Photinia x fraseti commonly known as red-tip photinia. Thirty plants were grown in containers coated on interior surfaces with 100 g Cu(OH) 2 /liter and thirty were grown in non-treated containers. The effects of <b>chemical</b> root <b>pruning</b> on water relations and root morphology were studied. A model was developed to predict transpiration in greenhouse grown photinia. A separate experiment was conducted to test accuracy of stem gauges. Chemically root pruned plants had a higher plant water uptake (10 - 15 % more than non-pruned plants). This was due to the apparent increase in fibrosity of the root system. Root surface area was found to be uniformly distributed in treated containers. Consequently, the treated plants were morphologically better developed. Leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, and stomatal aperture measurements were not found to be significantly different in treatment and control. A problem of excessively high flow rates was observed due to very small or negative values of dT in the stem gauges. The data was reconstructed accurately using a newly developed computer program. A regression model was developed to predict transpiration for greenhouse grown photinia in response to greenhouse weather parameters. R 2 was found to be 0. 79. It may be increased by incorporating in the model an additional term of accurately measured amount of water applied...|$|R
40|$|Publicaci√≥n ISIWe {{compared}} {{the relative importance}} of <b>chemical</b> alellopathy, <b>pruning</b> behaviour of resident ants and other non-related agents to ant-plant mutualism for seedling establishment beneath TriplaTiS americana L. (Polygonaceae), a myrmecophyte plant. We also included a preliminary analysis of effects of fragmentation on these ecological processes. Seeds and seedlings of Theobrorna cacao L. (Sterculiaceae) were used as the target species in all experiments. Leaf-tissue extracts of the myrmecophyte plant did not inhibit germination of cacao seeds. Resident Pseudomyrmex triplarinus Weddell (Pseudomyrmecinae) ants did not remove seeds under the canopy of their host plants. The main seed consumer was the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexclens L. (Myrmicinae). Leaves of cacao seedlings were partially or totally pruned by Pseudomyrmex ants mainly in forest fragments studied. We offer evidence pointing to the possibility that the absence of seedlings beneath Triplaris may result from effects of both ant species. We discuss the benefits of pruning behaviour for the resident ant colony and the effects of ant-ant interactions on seedling establishment beneath this ant-plant system. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|The one-year {{growth of}} {{lodgepole}} pine seedlings on two contrasting sites in interior British Columbia, a ploughed sandy nursery bed of low available moisture and a clayey wet forest soil, were investigated {{to evaluate the}} performance of seedlings subjected to chemical and mechanical root pruning techniques. Two sizes of chemically pruned seedlings were treated with a copper based paint (PCT 5 - 12 and PCT 4 - 10). The other treatments were containerized Styroblock (PSB) 4 - 15 seedling that were knife pruned in four ways (i. e. bottom plug removal = RPB, bottom plug removal and two lateral cuts = RPB+ 2, and lateral cutting with three cuts = RP 3 and six cuts = RP 6). Growths of pruned seedlings were compared to the un-pruned PSB 4 - 15 control group. While site soil conditions {{proved to be a}} stronger contributing factor to growth, pruning treatments induced different effects on seedlings particularly in root development. Root counts, root symmetry and proportion of direct large roots, showed greatest improvements. Root pruned seedlings also had better distribution of root growth throughout the plug. Among knife pruning treatments, lateral cutting methods were more favourable to early root growth with greater root counts after a twenty-one day period than bottom plug removal. The most extreme knife pruning treatment, consisting of six laterial cuts (RP 6), had a mean of 60 % removal of roots within the plug and showed no differences in height growth regardless of site. Also the RP 6 seedlings had 100 % survival. It shows that the PSB 4 - 15 seedling is to a great extent resilient to knife pruning, which should be encouraged where <b>chemical</b> root <b>pruning</b> is less useful as it improves rooting development in the early establishment of confer seedlings. Improved rooting establishment of planted seedlings may result to better adaptation to environmental conditions and competitive stresses, as well as improve stem morphology and long-term growth.

40|$|Predicting {{whether a}} {{molecule}} can traverse chemical labyrinths of channels, tunnels, and buried cavities usually requires performing computationally intensive molecular dynamics simulations. Often {{one wants to}} screen molecules to identify ones that can pass through a given chemical labyrinth or screen chemical labyrinths to identify those that allow a given molecule to pass. Because it is impractical to test each molecule/labyrinth pair using computationally expensive methods, faster, approximate methods are used to prune possibilities, ‚Äútriaging‚Äù {{the ability of a}} proposed molecule to pass through the given <b>chemical</b> labyrinth. Most <b>pruning</b> methods estimate <b>chemical</b> accessibility solely on geometry, treating atoms or groups of atoms as hard spheres with appropriate radii. Here, we explore geometric configurations for a moving ‚Äúmolecular worm,‚Äù which replaces spherical probes and is assembled from solid blocks connected by flexible links. The key is to extend the fast marching method, which is an ordered upwind one-pass Dijkstra-like method to compute optimal paths by efficiently solving an associated Eikonal equation for the cost function. First, we build a suitable cost function associated with each possible configuration, and second, we construct an algorithm that works in ensuing high-dimensional configuration space: at least seven dimensions are required to account for translational, rotational, and internal degrees of freedom. We demonstrate the algorithm to study shortest paths, compute accessible volume, and derive information on topology of the accessible part of a chemical labyrinth. As a model example, we consider an alkane molecule in a porous material, which is relevant to designing catalysts for oil processing...|$|R
