5|$|The {{origin of}} the name {{manganese}} is complex. In ancient times, two black minerals from Magnesia (located within modern Greece) were both called magnes from their place of origin, but were thought to differ in gender. The male magnes attracted iron, and was the iron ore now known as lodestone or magnetite, and which probably gave us the term magnet. The female magnes ore did not attract iron, but was used to decolorize glass. This feminine magnes was later called magnesia, known now in modern times as pyrolusite or manganese dioxide. Neither this mineral nor elemental manganese is magnetic. In the 16th century, manganese dioxide was called manganesum (note the two Ns instead of one) by glassmakers, possibly as a corruption and <b>concatenation</b> of two words, since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a magnesia negra (the black ore) from magnesia alba (a white ore, also from Magnesia, also useful in glassmaking). Michele Mercati called magnesia negra manganesa, and finally the metal isolated from it became known as manganese (German: Mangan). The name magnesia eventually was then used to refer only to the white magnesia alba (magnesium oxide), which provided the name magnesium for the free element when it was isolated much later.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{recent study}} of {{repetitive}} structures of strings, generalized notions of periods have been introduced. A typical regularity, the period u of a given string x, grasps the repetitiveness of x since x is a prefix of a string constructed by <b>concatenations</b> of u. A substring w of x is called a cover of x if x can be constructed by <b>concatenations</b> and superpositions of w. The notion “cover” is a generalization of periods {{in the sense that}} superpositions as well as <b>concatenations</b> are considered to define it, whereas only <b>concatenations</b> are considered for periods. We consider the all-covers problem, i. e., that of computing all the covers of a given string of length n. We present an optimal O(log log n) -time CRCW PRAM algorithm for the all-covers problem. Since there is an Ω(log log n) lower bound on the time complexity of the all-covers problem, our algorithm is work-time optimal...|$|R
