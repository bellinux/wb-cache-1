50|$|The {{government}} had not however awaited the crisis {{to begin a}} reflection on the structural {{strengths and weaknesses of}} Luxembourg. Commissioned by the previous coalition, professor Lionel Fontagné of the University of Paris I presented a report in November 2004 on Luxembourg's <b>competitivity,</b> entitled A crack in the steel (Une paille dans l’acier). The conclusions of this analysis fed in to the work of the Tripartite Coordination Committee which included the government and the social partners. The Tripartite managed to agree on the structural determinants of <b>competitivity,</b> namely education and innovation. Public and private efforts would increase spending on research and development. A national action plan was to allow the country to reach the Lisbon goals. The government increased its commitments to finance the activities of the University of Luxembourg, set up in 2003. In 2006, a multi-year contract was signed between the State and the University, providing the latter with long-term planning security.|$|E

The tradition of comprehensive agreements has been particularly persistent since then, even if there are always doomsayers predicting their end. Currently, there is no such agreement. This follows from the political pressures to increase public sector <b>competitivity</b> that led to comparatively higher increases in public sector wages, particularly nurses' wages.|$|E
50|$|A global wealth tax {{of about}} 1% on all wealth, {{including}} individual assets exceeding about US$ 1 million (including stocks and bonds) and all publicly listed companies and all trusts would raise at least US$ 600 {{billion per year}} (that's 1% of total world market capitalization, which in 2012 is about US$ 60 trillion).

Expensive but probably inevitable strategies to slow global warming include renewable energy research, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and reforestation (or preventing deforestation).|$|E

This allows us to define an undirected graph by connecting elements that compete. We call this graph a <b>competitivity</b> graph. We study the relationship of <b>competitivity</b> graphs with other well-known families of graphs, such as permutation graphs, comparability graphs and chordal graphs. In addition to this, we also introduce certain important sets of nodes in a <b>competitivity</b> graph. For example, nodes that compete among them form a <b>competitivity</b> set and nodes connected by chains of competitors form a set of eventual competitors.
