50|$|The {{manufacturing}} process {{does not produce}} <b>chemically</b> <b>pure</b> lactylates (e.g. stearoyl-2-lactylate) for two reasons. First, the source fatty acid is not <b>chemically</b> <b>pure</b> since it is typically derived from natural sources. The source fatty acid may contain varying ratios of different fatty acids (e.g. lauric acid (C12:0), myristic acid (C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), arachidic acid (C20:0), behenic acid (C22:0), etc.). Second, lactic acid readily undergoes self-esterification producing a variety of polylactyls (typically numbering from one to three lactyl groups).|$|R

40|$|Magnetite and sulfides in {{the black}} rims of {{carbonate}} globules in Martian meteorite ALH 84001 have been studied extensively because of the claim by McKay et al. that they are biogenic in origin. However, exclusively inorganic (abiotic) processes are able {{to account for the}} occurrence of carbonate-sulfide-magnetite assemblages in the meteorite. We have previously precipitated chemically zoned and sulfide-bearing carbonate globules analogous to those in ALH 84001 (at {{less than or equal to}} 150 C) from multiple fluxes of variable-composition Ca-Mg-Fe-CO 2 -S-H 2 O solutions. Brief heating of precipitated globules to approx. 470 C produced magnetite and pyrrhotite within the globules by thermal decomposition of siderite and pyrite, respectively. We have also shown that morphology of magnetite formed by inorganic thermal decomposition of Fe-rich carbonate is similar to the morphology of so-called biogenic magnetite in the carbonate globules of ALH 84001. Magnetite crystals in the rims of carbonate globules in ALH 84001 are <b>chemically</b> <b>pure</b> [Note: "Chemically pure" is defined here as magnetite with Mg at levels comparable or lower than Mg detected by [8] in ALH 84001 magnetite]. A debate continues on whether or not <b>chemically</b> <b>pure</b> magnetite can form by the thermal decomposition of mixed Mg-Fe-carbonates that have formed under abiotic conditions. Thomas-Keprta et al. argue that it is not possible to form Mg-free magnetite from Mg-Fe-carbonate based on thermodynamic data. We previously suggested that <b>chemically</b> <b>pure</b> magnetite could form by the thermal decomposition of relatively pure siderite in the outer rims of the globules. Mg-Fe-carbonates may also thermally decompose under conditions conducive for formation of <b>chemically</b> <b>pure</b> magnetite. In this paper we show through laboratory experiments that <b>chemically</b> <b>pure</b> magnetite can form by an inorganic process from mixed Mg-Fe-carbonates...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} {{of the origin of}} nanophase magnetite in Martian meteorite ALH 84001 has been widely debated for nearly a decade. Golden et al. have reported producing nearly <b>chemically</b> <b>pure</b> magnetite from thermal decomposition of chemically impure siderite [(Fe, Mg, Mn) CO 3]. This claim is significant for three reasons: first, {{it has been argued that}} <b>chemically</b> <b>pure</b> magnetite present in the carbonate disks in Martian meteorite ALH 84001 could have formed by the thermal decomposition of the impure carbonate matrix in which they are embedded; second, the chemical purity of magnetite has been previously used to identify biogenic magnetite; and, third, previous studies of thermal decomposition of impure (Mg,Ca,Mn) -siderites, which have been investigated under a wide variety of conditions by numerous researchers, invariably yields a mixed metal oxide phase as the product and not <b>chemically</b> <b>pure</b> magnetite. The explanation for this observation is that these siderites all possess the same crystallographic structure (Calcite; R 3 c) so solid solutions between these carbonates are readily formed and can be viewed on an atomic scale as two chemically different but structurally similar lattices...|$|R
