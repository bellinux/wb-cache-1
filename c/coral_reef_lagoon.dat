The benthic domain requires input of food from the pelagic system (mainly zooplankton) and from adjacent areas to sustain the biomass of predatory fishes.

The observed hysteresis may represent an overlooked challenge for predicting the effects of OA on coral reefs.

40|$|Abstract — Coastal wetlands, {{the places}} where the sea water meets the land are unique places in our global geography. They are endowed with a very wide range of coastal {{ecosystem}} like mangrove, <b>coral</b> <b>reef,</b> <b>lagoon,</b> sea grass, salt marsh and estuary. Wetlands offer myriad ecological benefits like flood control, ground water recharge and shoreline protection besides being cradles of biodiversity and habitats for waterfowl. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) in recent years have proved to be of great importance for effective resources management and coastal environmental monitoring. In the present study, an attempt has been made to delineate various coastal wetlands along Kollur-Chakra-Haladi, Sita-Swarna and Udyavara river systems in Udupi district of Karnataka. The study area geographically lies between the 13 ° 10 ’ N to 13 ° 40 ’ N latitudes and 74 ° 30 ’ E to 75 ° 20 ’ E longitudes.

40|$|Extract] The {{residence}} {{time is the}} characteristic time that a parcel of water will remain within a water body. The quantitative definition of "{{residence time}}" varies in the literature (Monsen et al., 2002). Generally, it is implied that a complete exchange of the water does not occur in this time. For this reason, the residence time is sometimes defined as the time for some fraction of the water to be exchanged. The residence time in a partially enclosed water body varies with oceanographic conditions, such as tides, waves and oceanic currents, and depends {{on the size of}} the water body and the degree of hydrodynamic connection with adjacent water bodies. Residence time is one of the key parameters controlling the fate of solutes in an enclosed water body such as a <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> <b>lagoon.</b> A long residence time could, for example, allow accumulation of pollutants. Residence time can also be very important in the (passive) dispersal of larvae...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} possible seasonal {{patterns in}} {{water quality and}} plankton distribution, weekly samples were collected in a <b>coral</b> <b>reef</b> <b>lagoon</b> and in surrounding nearshore waters over a two year period. Additionally, two oceanographic surveys were also conducted in a larger area surrounding the primary study site during the seasonal extremes. The resulting information corroborated previous observations that this area is as an oligotrophic environment. The larger-scale sampling revealed seasonal variation in cross-shelf gradients in plankton, fish-egg and larval densities that are probably related to the strong onshore winds that are typically present during the dry season. Although some limited nutrient enrichment occurs {{in parts of the}} nearshore area during the rainy season, the highest plankton density and biomass were recorded in shallow nearshore waters during the windy dry season. Larvae of numerous fish taxa were collected in these nearshore areas during the dry season, suggesting seasonal aggregation. During the rainy season, fish larvae were spread more evenly across the shelf and into nearshelf waters...|$|E
