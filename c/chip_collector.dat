5000|$|Myrtle Nola Young (April 1, 1924 - August 9, 2014) was an American potato <b>chip</b> <b>collector</b> whose {{collection}} {{caught the}} eye of national news and talk shows.|$|E
5000|$|Ashley Collins (born 1967) is an American Contemporary Painting Icon whose massive scaled {{paintings}} {{are found in}} blue chip collections and museums worldwide. [...] Collins’ painful and lengthy journey from homelessness and abject poverty to acclaimed painter informs meaning into each of her deeply layered works. Collins is known in part for taking exhibitions to a new level, such as floating 8’x10’ works off of 50’ cranes and using fire, water and other elements {{as part of her}} exhibitions. [...] Her journey from rags to riches {{has been one of the}} most painful but successful, in American Art. Although painting professionally since 1988, Collins first came to blue <b>chip</b> <b>collector</b> attention in the early 2000s for her massive scaled contemporary works integrating portions of figurative horseheads amongst layers of collage, historical documents, steel, metal, and other mediums which Collins integrated into her painting combines; breaking price points for living female contemporary painters. [...] “Collins has gone from being homeless and sleeping on concrete floors in pursuit of Artistic Success - and she has surely achieved it, her mega scale paintings including horse imagery sic command eye watering prices.” [...] Robert Rauschenberg, upon seeing her works, found in them the pain, confidence and struggles of his (sic) own journey.|$|E
5000|$|The {{importance}} and monetary values of Collins paintings {{are driven by}} international blue <b>chip</b> <b>collectors</b> and include collectors as varied as her works: Peter and Melanie Munk, Christy Walton, Marta Kaufman/Michael Skloff, Stan Kroenke, Blythe Danner, Steven Spielberg/Kate Kapshaw, Graeme Hart, Robert Redford, Chuck Binder, Gerald and Stanlee Rubin (founder, Rubin Center for the Visual Arts), John Kahlbetzer, [...] Jan Brink, Gianlucca Galtrucco, Tomas Milmo Santos, Danny Sullivan, Brenda Sullivan III, George Rosenthal, Bollinger Family Trust, Horchow Family Trust, Scott and Mer James, Dennis and Stacy Barsema, Dan and Luana Romanelli, Michael and Lauri Corliss, Norman Pearlmutter, Wade Skinner. Collins work {{is also found in}} many corporate collections worldwide: AXTEL, LIAG Argentina S.A., Creative Artist Agency, The Gores Group, Trinchero Family Estates Wineries, Barrick Gold, Harris Estates Winery, Corliss Winery, Carter Holt Harvey, 20th Century Fox, Gott Estate, among many others.|$|R

50|$|As {{the number}} of {{collectors}} grew, {{the creation of an}} official grading system was viewed as being a useful tool in part of the process to help determine the collectible value of the chips, as opposed to the face value they can also represent. In 2003, members of the CC&GTCC's Standards and Archives Committee agreed on a grading system that would be used worldwide. There are many published price guides, but two in particular are more widely used by casino <b>chip</b> <b>collectors.</b> The Official U.S. Casino Chip Price Guide, now in its 4th edition, covers chips from casinos in Nevada, Atlantic City, New Jersey, Colorado, Deadwood, South Dakota and the several Midwest States that permit Riverboat casinos. The Chip Rack, now in its 15th edition, attempts to include all chips and checks issued by casinos in the State of Nevada. Some chips are considered high-value and have a listed value as high as $50,000. During their 2014 convention, a $5 chip from the Golden Goose SOLD for $75,000, and a $5 chip from the Lucky Casino SOLD for $52,500.|$|R
40|$|Florida International University's (FIU) Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology (HCET) {{evaluated}} five saws {{for their}} effectiveness in cutting specially prepared fiberglass-reinforced plywood crates. These crates were built as surrogates for crates that presently hold radioactively contaminated gloveboxes at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Los Alamos facility. The Evolution 180 circular saw was assessed on August 14, 2001. During the FIU test of efficacy, {{a team from}} the Operating Engineers National Hazmat Program (OENHP) evaluated {{the occupational safety and}} health issues associated with this technology. The Evolution 180 is a portable, metal cutting circular saw with a 7 -inch diameter blade. The blade is contained within the main housing and has a retractable lower blade guard to prevent operator access to the blade during operation and shutdown. The saw is equipped with a <b>chip</b> <b>collector.</b> The maximum cutting thickness for metal is one-quarter inch and can cut steel tubing and pipe 2 inches in diameter. The unit is operated with an on/off guarded trigger switch and is supported with the hand guide mounted to the side of the saw. An adjustable lever sets the depth of the cut. The machine's circuitry will automatically shut the saw motor off if excessive overload is detected during operation. The one-half hour demonstration involved vertical and horizontal cuts and blade changes. During this process, operators experienced binding of the saw. This caused the blade to become hot, causing the sawdust collected in the <b>chip</b> <b>collector</b> to smoke. Care should be exercised to use the appropriate blade for the application, operator training, and personal protective equipment (PPE). Personal noise sampling indicated that neither worker was over the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Action Level of 85 decibels (dBA) with time-weighted averages (TWA's) of 69. 1 and 68. 8 dBA. The personal noise sample taken during the special demonstration with the stainless steel plate had a TWA of 69. 8 dBA. These data are not entirely representative as they were gathered during a simulation and not at the actual worksite. Additional sampling should be conducted on-site, but the workers should wear hearing protection until it is determined that it is no longer necessary. The total nuisance dust sample for the Evolution 180 circular saw was 3. 5 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m{sup 3 }), which is lower than the OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of 15 mg/m{sup 3 } and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists' (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Value (TLV) of 10 mg/m{sup 3 }. The fiber analysis yielded 1. 74 fibers per cubic centimeter (f/cc), which is above the PEL of 1 f/cc. Although the nuisance dust levels were low, fiberglass dust levels were higher than the PEL. Since fiberglass dust is known to be a strong skin irritant and a possible human carcinogen, the workers should continue to wear appropriate suits and gloves, as well as a full-face air-purifying respirator. The respirator should be equipped with a combination organic vapor and acid gas cartridge in combination with a High Particulate Air (HEPA) filter, since particulate filter, since during the demonstration, the workers complained of an odd smell, which may have been from the breakdown of the fiberglass...|$|E
