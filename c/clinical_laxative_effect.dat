40|$|Abstract Background Brazilian green {{propolis}} {{is reported}} to have wide range of biological properties including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-influenza, and antioxidant activities. In the digestive system, a protective effect of propolis on gastric ulcer has been reported, but a <b>laxative</b> <b>effect</b> has not yet been reported. We investigated the effect and the mechanism of action of water and ethanol extracts of Brazilian green propolis. Methods We examined the <b>laxative</b> <b>effect</b> of propolis on stool frequency by administering orally an ethanol extract of propolis (EEP) or a water extract of propolis (WEP) at 10, 50, 100, or 500 mg/kg to normal mice. We then investigated the effects of propolis using constipation model mice induced by two types of drugs, loperamide (a μ opioid receptor agonist) and clonidine (an α- 2 adrenergic receptor agonist). We also investigated the effects of WEP on gastrointestinal transit and contractional tension of the ileum to uncover the mechanism of action of WEP. Results Treatment with WEP, but not with EEP, significantly increased the weight of stools (p Conclusion These findings indicate that WEP has <b>laxative</b> <b>effects</b> both in normal mice and in clonidine-induced constipation model mice. The <b>laxative</b> <b>effects</b> of WEP might be mediated by increased contractional tension of the ileum exerted at least in part via activation of an acetylcholine receptor. </p...|$|R
50|$|Xylitol has {{no known}} {{toxicity}} in humans, however, some report heart palpitations after consuming it. In one study, participants consumed a monthly average of 1.5 kg of xylitol {{with a maximum}} daily intake of 430 g with no apparent ill effects. Like most sugar alcohols, xylitol has a <b>laxative</b> <b>effect</b> because sugar alcohols are not fully broken down during digestion; however, the effect varies from person to person. In one study of 13 children, four experienced diarrhea from xylitol's <b>laxative</b> <b>effect</b> when they ate more than 65 grams per day. Studies have reported that adaptation occurs after several weeks of consumption.|$|R
50|$|In medicine, {{magnesium}} oxide {{is used for}} relief of heartburn and sour stomach, as an antacid, magnesium supplement, and as a short-term laxative. It {{is also used to}} improve symptoms of indigestion. Side effects of {{magnesium oxide}} may include nausea and cramping. In quantities sufficient to obtain a <b>laxative</b> <b>effect,</b> side effects of long-term use include enteroliths resulting in bowel obstruction.|$|R

50|$|Norbu is {{considered}} to be free of immediate adverse effects. Because Norbu is new product, no data has been gathered on the long-term safety of Norbu for humans. Overconsumption however may have a <b>laxative</b> <b>effect</b> due to the presence of Erythritol.|$|R
5000|$|Sorbitol {{can be used}} as a {{laxative}} via an {{oral suspension}} or enema. As with other sugar alcohols, gastrointestinal distress may result when food products that contain sorbitol are consumed. Sorbitol exerts its <b>laxative</b> <b>effect</b> by drawing water into the large intestine, thereby stimulating bowel movements. [...] Sorbitol has been determined safe for use by the elderly, although it is not recommended without consultation with a clinician. [...] Sorbitol is found in some dried fruits and may contribute to the <b>laxative</b> <b>effects</b> of prunes. Sorbitol was discovered initially in the fresh juice of mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia) berries in 1872. It is found in the fruits of apples, plums, pears, cherries, dates, peaches, and apricots.|$|R
40|$|Castor oil {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} drugs. When given orally, it has a <b>laxative</b> <b>effect</b> and induces labor in {{pregnant}} females. The effects of castor oil are mediated by ricinoleic acid, a hydroxylated fatty acid released from castor oil by intestinal lipases. Despite the wide-spread use of castor oil in conventional and folk medicine, the molecular mechanism by which ricinoleic acid acts remains unknown. Here we show that the EP 3 prostanoid receptor is specifically activated by ricinoleic acid and that it mediates the pharmacological effects of castor oil. In mice lacking EP 3 receptors, the <b>laxative</b> <b>effect</b> and the uterus contraction induced via ricinoleic acid are absent. Although a conditional deletion of the EP 3 receptor gene in intestinal epithelial cells did not affect castor oil-induced diarrhea, mice lacking EP 3 receptors only in smooth-muscle cells were unresponsive to this drug. Thus, the castor oil metabolite ricinoleic acid activates intestinal and uterine smooth-muscle cells via EP 3 prostanoid receptors. These findings identify the cellular and molecular mechanism underlying the pharmacological effects of castor oil and indicate a role of the EP 3 receptor as a target to induce <b>laxative</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R
50|$|Natural {{chemical}} compounds similar to oxyphenisatine {{may be present}} in prunes, but a recent review of the relevant scientific literature suggests that the <b>laxative</b> <b>effect</b> of prunes is due to other constituents including phenolic compounds (mainly neochlorogenic acids and chlorogenic acids) and sorbitol.|$|R
50|$|Possible {{theories}} {{behind the}} phenomena include {{the smell of}} paper or ink having a <b>laxative</b> <b>effect,</b> the association with reading on the toilet at home, and the posture of browsing making bowel movement easier. The evidence for these explanations however remains weak.|$|R
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the extract from cascara bark also {{contains}} a substance called emodin, which may have anti-cancer effects. Emodin is also responsible for some of the <b>laxative</b> <b>effect,</b> due to its excitation of smooth muscle cells in the large intestine.|$|R
50|$|These glycosides {{contain an}} {{aglycone}} {{group that is}} a derivative of anthraquinone. They have a <b>laxative</b> <b>effect.</b> They are mainly found in dicot plants except the Liliaceae family which are monocots. They are present in senna, rhubarb and Aloe species. Antron and anthranol are reduced forms of anthraquinone.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{magnesium}} hydroxide products sold for antacid use (such as Maalox) are formulated to minimize unwanted <b>laxative</b> <b>effects</b> through {{the inclusion of}} aluminum hydroxide, which inhibits the contractions of smooth muscle cells in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby counterbalancing the contractions induced by the osmotic effects of the {{magnesium hydroxide}}.|$|R
40|$|The role of {{constitutive}} and inducible {{nitric oxide}} (NO) synthase in rats treated with senna and cascara was studied. Senna (60 mg/kg p. o.) and cascara (800 mg/kg p. o.) ex vivo significantly increased Ca 2 +-dependent constitutive NO synthase activity in the rat colon. Induction of NO synthase (12 % of the total NO synthase) was associated with cascara, but not senna, administration. Dexamethasone (0. 03 - 0. 3 mg/kg i. p.), which inhibits the expression of inducible NO synthase, significantly and dose-dependently reduced cascara- (but not senna-) induced diarrhoea and colonic fluid secretion. These findings suggest that senna probably exerts its <b>laxative</b> <b>effect</b> through stimulation of the constitutive isoform of NO synthase, while the inducible isoform of NO synthase {{also seems to be}} involved in the <b>laxative</b> <b>effect</b> of cascara...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Constipation is {{a common}} problem in males and females. The aim {{of the present study}} was to {{evaluate}} the <b>laxative</b> <b>effects</b> of fermented rice extract (FRe) on rats with loperamide-induced constipation. FRe (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg) was administered orally once per day for six days following 1 h loperamide treatment. The <b>laxative</b> <b>effects</b> of FRe were compared with those of sodium picosulfate (S. picosulfate). Following the induction of constipation in the rats, a marked decrease was observed in the fecal pellet number and water content discharged over 24 h, the surface mucus thickness in the colonic lumen, intestinal charcoal transit ratio, thickness of the colonic mucosa and the number of mucus-producing cells, while an increase was observed in the number of fecal pellets remaining in the colonic lumen and their mean diameter, as compared with the normal vehicle control rats. These condi-tions were significantly alleviated following the administration of the three doses of FRe when compared with the loperamide control group. However, the alleviating effects were lower than those of S. picosulfate, with the exception of the intestinal charcoal transit ratio. Similar effects on the intestinal charcoal transit ratio were detected for the three doses of FRe when compared with the S. picosulfate-treated rats. In conclusion, the results indicated that FRe exhibits a <b>laxative</b> <b>effect</b> without causing diarrhea, as compared with sodium picosulfate; thus, FRe may be effective as a complementary medicine in patients suffering from lifestyle-induced constipation...|$|R

40|$|The {{therapeutic}} value of Eugenia jambolana Lam. {{commonly known as}} ‘Jamun’ has been recognized in different system of traditional medication {{for the treatment of}} different diseases and ailments. It contains several phytoconstituents belonging to category of alkaloids, glucosides, flavonoides and volatile oils. It has been reported as digestive, astringent to the bowels, anthelmintic, sore throat, bronchitis, asthma, thirst, biliousness, dysentery, blood purifier, ulcers and diabetes. There are few reports available on clinical uses of Eugenia jambolana in diabetes that have shown promising results. In south India ayurvedic practitioners were using the leaf buds of Eugenia jambolana to induce <b>laxative</b> <b>effect</b> and to clean up the intestinal contents before starting any medication. The result showed that of E. jambolana stimulates the contractile action of frog and mice through an acetylcholine-like mechanism and effectively stimulates gastrointestinal motility in mice and frogs.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to validate the}} medicinal use of Chrozophora prostrata in constipation. The crude extract of C prostrata produced <b>laxative</b> <b>effect</b> in mice at 100 and 300 mg/kg, similar to carbachol and castor oil. In spontaneously contracting rabbit jejunum tissues, C. prostrata (0. 01 - 3 mg/mL) exhibited atropine-sensitive spasmogenic effect, which was reproducible in guinea-pig ileum. Interestingly, at high concentrations, C. prostrata showed concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on rabbit jejunum, suggesting the presence of accompanied spasmolytic activity. When tested on induced contractions, C. prostrata completely relaxed low K+-induced contraction, while partially inhibited high K+, similar to cromakalim. Tetraethylammonium pretreatment abolished the relaxant effect of C. prostrata on low K+-induced contractions while glibenclamide caused partial inhibition, suggesting the involvement of some non-specific and ATP-dependent K+ channels. These data show that C. prostrata possesses <b>laxative</b> <b>effect</b> at low doses mediated through cholinergic action followed by the spasmolytic activity at high doses mediated possibly through K+ channel activation...|$|R
