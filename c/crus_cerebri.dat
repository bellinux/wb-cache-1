50|$|The {{corticobulbar tract}} {{originates}} {{in the primary}} motor cortex of the frontal lobe, just superior to the lateral fissure and rostral to the central sulcus in the precentral gyrus also known as Brodmann area 4. The tract descends through the corona radiata and genu of the internal capsule with a few fibers in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, as it passes from the cortex down to the midbrain. In the midbrain, the internal capsule becomes the cerebral peduncles. The white matter {{is located in the}} ventral portion of the cerebral peduncles, called the <b>crus</b> <b>cerebri.</b> The middle third of the <b>crus</b> <b>cerebri</b> contains the corticobulbar and corticospinal fibers. The corticobulbar fibers exit at the appropriate level of the brainstem to synapse on the lower motor neurons of the cranial nerves.|$|E

50|$|Structures {{that develop}} to grow ventral or lateral outside this {{primitive}} tube as add-ons (e.g., the <b>crus</b> <b>cerebri</b> in the anterior of the midbrain) {{are not considered}} part of the tegmentum, as they {{are not part of the}} primitive neural tube but grow as projections from the cerebral cortex.

5000|$|The {{cerebral}} peduncles are structures at {{the front}} of the midbrain which arise from the front of the pons and contain the large ascending (sensory) and descending (motor) nerve tracts that run to and from the cerebrum from the pons.Mainly, the three common areas that give rise to the cerebral peduncles are the cerebral cortex, the spinal cord and the cerebellum. [...] The cerebral peduncle, by most classifications, is everything in the midbrain except the tectum. The region includes the tegmentum, <b>crus</b> <b>cerebri</b> and pretectum. By this definition, the cerebral peduncles are also known as the basis pedunculi, while the large ventral bundle of efferent fibers is referred to as the cerebral crus or the pes pedunculi.|$|E

50|$|Cortical {{upper motor neurons}} {{originate}} from Brodmann areas 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 and then descend in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, through the <b>crus</b> <b>cerebri,</b> down through the pons, and to the medullary pyramids, where about 90% of the axons cross to the contralateral side at the decussation of the pyramids. They then descend as the lateral corticospinal tract. These axons synapse with lower motor neurons in the ventral horns of {{all levels of the}} spinal cord. The remaining 10% of axons descend on the ipsilateral side as the ventral corticospinal tract. These axons also synapse with lower motor neurons in the ventral horns. Most of them will cross to the contralateral side of the cord (via the anterior white commissure) right before synapsing.|$|E
40|$|Nigral basal {{adenylate cyclase}} and dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase, {{glutamate}} decarboxylase, choline acetyltransferase, and tyrosine hydroxylase activities were measured in rats with hemitransections {{at various levels}} or with electrolytic lesions of the medial forebrain bundle or the <b>crus</b> <b>cerebri.</b> The loss of nigral dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity after the various brain lesions was correlated with loss of nigral glutamic acid decarboxylase but not that of tyrosine hydroxylase; nigral choline acetyltransferase was unaffected in all cases. The data indicate that the nigral dopamine-sensitive adenylate cylase activity may be localized on neurons afferent to the nigra, probably originating from the globus pallidus and possibly from {{the tail of the}} caudate.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{purpose of}} this study was to provide {{practical}} data for the imaging diagnosis of the optic pathways. MethodsSectional anatomy of the optic pathways on the coronal plane was investigated on 15 sets of serial coronal sections of the head of Chinese adult cadavers and 6 sets of serial coronal magnetic resonance imaging of normal adults. ResultsOn the coronal plane, we recognized the special structures of optic pathways by 5 key sections. (1) The midorbital optic nerve lay superomedially in the center of the adipose body of the orbit, surrounded by the subarachnoid space and the sheath of the optic nerve. (2) The optic chiasma was transverse between the optic and infundibular recesses of the portion of the floor of the third ventricle and it lay below the A 1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery and above the tuber cinereum and the pituitary stalk, C 2 or C 3 segment of the internal carotid artery laterally. (3) The optic tract lay between the <b>crus</b> <b>cerebri</b> and the amygdaloid, the tail of the caudate nucleus laterally. The anterior choroidal artery inferiorly and downward M 2 segment of the middle cerebral artery lay between the uncus and the <b>crus</b> <b>cerebri.</b> (4) The lateral geniculate body lay between the <b>crus</b> <b>cerebri</b> medially and the tail of the caudate nucleus laterally, the uncus and P 2 segment of the posterior cerebral artery inferiorly. (5) The optic radiation formed the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle both in the temporal horn and in the occipital horn. The optic radiation was separated from the wall of the occipital horn by the tapetum, a thin layer of fibers derived from the splenium of the corpus callosum. Coronal sectional anatomy and magnetic resonance imaging of the optic pathways revealed similar results. ConclusionThis study provides a good understanding of the structures of the optic pathways by correlation of coronal sections of the head of adult cadavers with the coronal magnetic resonance images of normal adults.

40|$|High field {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) -based delineation of the substantia nigra (SN) and visualization of its inner cellular organization are promising methods {{for the evaluation of}} morphological changes associated with neurodegenerative diseases; however, corresponding MR contrasts must be matched and validated with quantitative histological information. Slices from two postmortem SN samples were imaged with a 7 Tesla (7 T) MRI with T 1 and T 2 * imaging protocols and then stained with Perl’s Prussian blue, Kluver-Barrera, tyrosine hydroxylase, and calbindin immunohistochemistry in a serial manner. The association between T 2 * values and quantitative histology was investigated with a co-registration method that accounts for histology slice preparation. The ventral T 2 * hypointense layers between the SNr and the <b>crus</b> <b>cerebri</b> extended anteriorly to the posterior part of the <b>crus</b> <b>cerebri,</b> which demonstrates the difficulty with an MRI-based delineation of the SN. We found that the paramagnetic hypointense areas within the dorsolateral SN corresponded to clusters of neuromelanin (NM). These NM-rich zones were distinct from the hypointense ventromedial regions with high iron pigments. Nigral T 2 * imaging at 7 T can reflect the density of NM-containing neurons as the metal-bound NM macromolecules may decrease T 2 * values and cause hypointense signalling in T 2 * imaging at 7 T. ope...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{mesencephalon}} {{is involved}} in a number of human neurodegenera-tive disorders and has been typically imaged with T 1 -, T 2 - and T 2 *-weighted methods. Our aim was to collect high-contrast susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) data to differentiate among and within the basic mesencephalic structures: namely, the red nucleus, substantia nigra, and <b>crus</b> <b>cerebri.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: High-resolution SWI, 3 D T 1 -weighted, and T 2 -weighted data were col-lected to study contrast in the mesencephalon at 1. 5 T and 4 T. Contrast between structures was calculated for SWI high-pass (HP) -filtered-phase, T 1 gradient-echo, and spin-echo T 2 -weighted data. RESULTS: SWI HP-filtered-phase data revealed similar contrast for the red nucleus and substantia nigra when compared with T 2 -weighted imaging. However, SWI was able to show structures within the red nucleus, substantia nigra, and medial geniculate body that were invisible on T 2 -weighted imaging. T 1 -weighted imaging, on the other hand, did not reveal measurable contrast for any of the structures of interest. SWI HP-filtered-phase data at 4 T agreed well with india inkstained cadaver brain studies, which appear to correlate with capillary density. CONCLUSIONS: With SWI, it is possible to create better anatomic images of the mesencephalon, with improved contrast compared with conventional T 1 - or T 2 -weighted sequences...|$|E
40|$|Non-Wilsonian hepatolenticular {{degeneration}} (NWHD) is {{a heterogeneous}} neurological disorder occurring secondary to chronic acquired liver disease. Genetically determined familial NWHD is rare, poorly understood, and often mistaken for Wilson's disease (WD). We analysed clinical and MRI profiles of NWHD patients {{who did not}} have obvious cause for acquired liver disease, such as alcohol intake or hepatitis. Six patients from four families (four males, two females, mean age: 17. 0 +/- standard deviation 7. 9 years), presenting with chronic extrapyramidal disorder resembling WD and imaging (abdominal ultrasound/MRI) evidence of cirrhosis were studied. They lacked Kayser-Fleischer rings or biochemical and/or genetic evidence of WD. Clinical features included dystonia (n = 6), parkinsonism (n = 3), tremor (n = 1), cerebellar ataxia (n = 3), orofacial dyskinesia (n = 1), behavioural abnormalities (n = 3), and cognitive decline (n = 1). Brain MRI revealed T 1 -weighted hyperintensity in the pallidum (n = 6), <b>crus</b> <b>cerebri</b> (n = 4), putamen (n = 1), caudate (n = 1), thalamus (n = 1), and red nucleus (n = 1) with T 2 -weighted shortening in some of these regions. Additional findings included giant cisterna magna (n = 1), face of giant panda sign (n = 1) and thin corpus callosum (n = 1). Areas of ``blooming'' on susceptibility weighted images were noted in two patients in the caudate (n = 2) and putamen (n = 1). The finding of T 1 shortening is distinct from that of WD where the majority of lesions are T 1 -hypointense and T 2 -hyperintense. Extrapallidal T 1 -hyperintensity is also an exceptional observation in NWHD. The MRI appearance of intense T 1 shortening coupled with the lack of increased susceptibility changes suggests that the most likely mineral deposited is manganese. The association of this neurological disorder and cirrhosis of the liver {{in the absence of an}} acquired liver disease is a distinct disease entity. This syndrome may rep; resent a disorder of manganese metabolism resulting in its toxic deposition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{anatomy of}} the substantia nigra on {{conventional}} MRI is controversial. Even using histological techniques {{it is difficult to}} delineate with certainty from surrounding structures. We sought to define the {{anatomy of the}} SN using high field spin-echo MRI of pathological material in which we could study the anatomy in detail to corroborate our MRI findings in controls and Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. Methods: 23 brains were selected from the Queen Square Brain Bank (10 controls, 8 progressive supranuclear palsy, 5 Parkinson's disease) and imaged using high field 9. 4  Tesla spin-echo MRI. Subsequently brains were cut and stained with Luxol fast blue, Perls stain, and immunohistochemistry for substance P and calbindin. Once the anatomy was defined on histology the dimensions and volume of the substantia nigra were determined on high field magnetic resonance images. Results: The anterior border of the substantia nigra was defined by the <b>crus</b> <b>cerebri.</b> In the medial half it was less distinct due to the deposition of iron and the interdigitation of white matter and the substantia nigra. The posterior border was flanked by white matter bridging the red nucleus and substantia nigra and seen as hypointense on spin-echo magnetic resonance images. Within the substantia nigra high signal structures corresponded to confirmed nigrosomes. These were still evident in Parkinson's disease but not in progressive supranuclear palsy. The volume and dimensions of the substantia nigra were similar in Parkinson's disease and controls, but reduced in progressive supranuclear palsy. Conclusions: We present a histologically validated anatomical description of the substantia nigra on high field spin-echo high resolution magnetic resonance images and were able to delineate all five nigrosomes. In accordance with the pathological literature we did not observe changes in the nigrosome structure as manifest by volume or signal characteristics within the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease whereas in progressive supranuclear palsy there was microarchitectural destruction...|$|E
40|$|Magnetization {{transfer}} (MT) {{reflects the}} exchange of magnetization between protons bound to macromolecules, such as lipids and proteins, and protons in free liquid, and thus might be an early marker for subtle and undetermined pathologic changes in tissue. Detailed analysis of the entire MT phenomenon, however, commonly requires extensive data acquisition and scanning time, and hence is only of limited clinical interest. Therefore, in practice, magnetization transfer effects are commonly confined into a simple ratio measure, the so-called magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), calculated from a MT-weighted and a non-MT-weighted image. However, subtle physiologic and pathologic changes in tissue, invaluable for specific diagnostic imaging, may be lost since MTR-values depend not only on quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) parameters but also on sequence parameters and relaxation properties. In order to evaluate and assess the diagnostic specificity of MTR versus qMT, high-resolution whole brain MT data was collected from twelve healthy volunteers using balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP). In contrast to common MT imaging based on spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) sequences, whole brain qMT imaging can be performed with MT-sensitized bSSFP within a clinically feasible acquisition time. Hence, MT-sensitized bSSFP provides access to both MTR and qMT parameters within a clinical setting. The reliability and possible diagnostic value of MTR are analyzed for twelve white matter (WM) and eleven gray matter (GM) structures of the normal appearing brain. Strong correlations were found within and between longitudinal and transverse relaxation times (T 1, T 2) and MT parameters (ratio between macromolecular and water protons, F, and magnetization exchange rate, kf), whereas weaker correlations were observed between MTR-values and relaxation times or MT parameters. Structures with highly similar MTR-values, such as the <b>crus</b> <b>cerebri</b> and the anterior commissure in the WM, or the pallidum and the amygdala in the GM, however, were also found that showed significant differences in most quantitative parameters. This observation was confirmed from simulations revealing that the overall effect on MTR from an increase (decrease) in relaxation times may be counterbalanced with a decrease (increase) in MT parameters. These findings corroborate the expectation that qMT is superior to MTR imaging, especially for the evaluation and assessment of pathologic or physiological changes in healthy and pathologic brain tissue...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Palpation is an {{important}} diagnostic method to assess elasticity changes which indicate the presence of disease processes. Using modern medical imaging methods, elastography allows quantitative evaluation of mechanical changes in living tissue. This technique enables the investigation of organs like the human brain, which cannot be palpated. Mechanical waves are generated in the brain, and the acquired wave images are used to produce maps of viscoelasticity parameters. The major goal {{of this study was}} to develop an effective and gentle indirect wave excitation setup for high-resolution cerebral multifrequency magnetic resonance elastography (mMRE) and validate it as a clinically applicable method. Methods: The new remote wave excitation based on a thorax mat was compared to the established head rocker stimulation in 12 volunteers. A driving frequency range of 25 – 45 Hz was used for the excitation. Images were acquired in a coronal slice orientation in order to analyze specific anatomical regions along the spinothalamic pathway. A multifrequency inversion provided high-resolution maps of the viscoelastic parameters |G*| and φ. The amplitudes of the waves were quantified. After the measurements, the volunteers and the three operators completed a questionnaire rating the comfort and convenience of mMRE using the two methods of mechanical excitation. Results: The remote wave excitation setup was rated more comfortable (p = 0. 02) and easier to set up than the head rocker. Additionally, the variability of the shear wave amplitudes between the subjects, which occur with the conventional setup, was reduced. The viscoelastic parameters obtained with both setups were comparable. Specific elasticity values in the brain regions of pons (|G*| = 0. 97 ± 0. 08 kPa), capsula interna (|G*| = 1. 29 ± 0. 14 kPa) and <b>crus</b> <b>cerebri</b> (|G*| = 1. 64 ± 0. 26 kPa) were measured in this study for the first time. Discussion: Although pilot studies showed encouraging results in patients with multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and brain tumors, cerebral mMRE has not been established in the clinic, due in part to discomfort from onerous mechanical stimulation applied directly to the head. The new method allows remote excitation, which improves patient comfort, and allows repeatable measurements with comparable wave amplitudes. As a result of these improvements, future mMRE studies have the potential to detect local viscoelasticity changes with higher sensitivity and in a wider range of patients. The indirect wave excitation setup simplifies and enhances the clinical applicability of mMRE for neuroradiological examinations...|$|E
40|$|An autopsy {{case of a}} 17 month-old male infant with {{stenosis}} of {{the arteries}} of the circle of Willis, due to intimal fibromuscular dysplasia, was presented. The child's suffering began with a sudden onset of clonic spasm of the face, fingers and limbs subsequently followed by hemiparesis at the left side 7 months after birth. Carotid angiograms disclosed stenosis of bilateral internal carotid arteries at the siphon portion and the cervical internal carotid artery to the left. No suggestion {{of the existence of}} cerebral arterial rete was seen. Symmetrical enlargement of the lateral ventricles was noted on PEG. Cerebrospinal fluid gave no abnormal values in cytological and biochemical examinations. Spastic episodes disappeared largely with antispastic drugs, but left hemiparesis persisted. One day prior to death, the patient's temperature rose remarkably and following general convulsion the patient died. The direct cause of death was acute purulent meningitis. Clinical examination detected coli bacilli septicemia. Autopsy revealed that besides meningitis purulenta, sclerosis of the brain was found in the parietotemporal region of both hemispheres which extended into the precentral and frontal gyri, but was found to be more diffuse and intense in distribution and degree at the right side, including entire involvement of the occipital lobe. Meningeal blood vessels were anemic in the sclerosing area, but otherwise intensively hyperemic, which was suggestive of constriction of blood vessels entering into the sclerosed brain. Microscopically laminar or pseudolaminar necrosis of the cortex and demyelination and gliosis of the white matter were observed, whereas the basal ganglions were spared somewhat, only showing a slight degeneration. The internal capsule, <b>crus</b> <b>cerebri</b> and the corticopontine and corticospinal tracts were blanched. The bilateral distal portions of the internal carotid arteries, the bilateral middle and posterior cerebral arteries at the circle, and the hasilar artery were narrowed in decreasing order of intensity of intimal cushions or pads which consisted of proliferation of smooth muscle cells each encircled with collageneous and reticular fibers. Duplication and fragmentation of elastic fibers and the acidmucopolysaccharide metamorphosis of subendothelial ground substances were also apparent. A few fat granules and no disruption of internal elastic lamina were observed. The intimal thickening was considered to be caused by abnormal growth of cushions themseves which are found even in normal fetuses, infants and juveniles at the branching sites of the middlesized arteries such as the distal portion of the internal carotid artery, the middle cerebral artery and so on. This histological consideration might give a key to clarify the morphogenesis of spontaneous stenosis or occlusion of the arteries in the circle of Willis in “moyamoya” disease. The cause of the sclerotic lesion of the brain was attributable to the stenosis of the arteries in the distal portion of the internal carotid ateries and in the circle of Willis mentioned above, but other factors, for example, spastic constriction of blood vessels may also contribute to the induction of the widespread lesion of the right hemisphere. The brain sclerosis might be related partly to spasm of blood vessels...|$|E
