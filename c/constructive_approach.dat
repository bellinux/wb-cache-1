25|$|The hyperreals can be {{developed}} either axiomatically or by more constructively oriented methods. The essence of the axiomatic approach is to assert (1) the existence {{of at least one}} infinitesimal number, and (2) the validity of the transfer principle. In the following subsection we give a detailed outline of a more <b>constructive</b> <b>approach.</b> This method allows one to construct the hyperreals if given a set-theoretic object called an ultrafilter, but the ultrafilter itself cannot be explicitly constructed.|$|E

He emphasised democratic reform {{as the core}} issue {{of the party and}} wanted to end the polarisation between the Labour Party (PvdA) and People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), in order to form a government without the Christian Democratic Appeal. He led the party in the 1986 general election and gained three seats. In the 1989 election the party won another three seats, making a total of twelve, and it was asked to join the formation talks of a CDA/PvdA/D66 cabinet. Although the PvdA preferred a government with D66, the CDA did not. In the end, D66 was numerically not necessary for the coalition, and they were excluded. Although in opposition, D66 adopted a <b>constructive</b> <b>approach</b> towards the government.|$|E

25|$|Many of Euclid's propositions were constructive, {{demonstrating the}} {{existence}} of some figure by detailing the steps he used to construct the object using a compass and straightedge. His <b>constructive</b> <b>approach</b> appears even in his geometry's postulates, as {{the first and third}} postulates stating {{the existence of}} a line and circle are constructive. Instead of stating that lines and circles exist per his prior definitions, he states {{that it is possible to}} 'construct' a line and circle. It also appears that, for him to use a figure in one of his proofs, he needs to construct it in an earlier proposition. For example, he proves the Pythagorean theorem by first inscribing a square on the sides of a right triangle, but only after constructing a square on a given line one proposition earlier.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the main}} goals of {{invariant}} theory was to solve the [...] "finite basis problem". The sum or product of any two invariants is invariant, and the finite basis problem asked whether {{it was possible to}} get all the invariants by starting with a finite list of invariants, called generators, and then, adding or multiplying the generators together. For example, the discriminant gives a finite basis (with one element) for the invariants of binary quadratic forms. Noether's advisor, Paul Gordan, was known as the [...] "king of invariant theory", and his chief contribution to mathematics was his 1870 solution of the finite basis problem for invariants of homogeneous polynomials in two variables. He proved this by giving a constructive method for finding all of the invariants and their generators, but was not able to carry out this <b>constructive</b> <b>approach</b> for invariants in three or more variables. In 1890, David Hilbert proved a similar statement for the invariants of homogeneous polynomials in any number of variables. Furthermore, his method worked, not only for the special linear group, but also for some of its subgroups such as the special orthogonal group. His first proof caused some controversy because it did not give a method for constructing the generators, although in later work he made his method constructive. For her thesis, Noether extended Gordan's computational proof to homogeneous polynomials in three variables. Noether's <b>constructive</b> <b>approach</b> made it possible to study the relationships among the invariants. Later, after she had turned to more abstract methods, Noether called her thesis [...] (crap) and Formelngestrüpp (a jungle of equations).|$|E

40|$|Nomothetic {{approaches}} identify statistical tendencies from large-scale, cross-cultural data sets. Recently, newly {{available data}} and statistical techniques have prompted {{a number of}} studies which consider the links between language structure and social structure. This can contribute in two ways to <b>constructive</b> <b>approaches</b> that try to explain how cultural forces shape language. First, it can provide new empirical data on which to test models. Secondly, it can suggest phenomena for <b>constructive</b> <b>approaches</b> to aspire to. Agent-based models provide a good way of identifying mechanisms, but are often too abstract to be tested against real data (Vogt & De Boer, 2010). Results from nomothetic research can guide computational models with regards to the relevant factors that affect language evolution. For example, Lupyan and Dale (2010) show that population size predicts morphological complexity. While many models consider demongraphic data (e. g. Nowak et al., 2001), few consider a realistic notion of morphological versus lexical marking. However, caution is required when using nomothetic results to inform <b>constructive</b> <b>approaches.</b> While nomothetic approaches can identify trends, they provide little explanatory power with regards to the mechanisms which brought about these trends. That is, it’s not a straightforward task to convert the phenomena that nomothetic approaches discove...|$|R

The impact of management processes on natural systems from the recreational businesses and recreational infrastructure is shown.
