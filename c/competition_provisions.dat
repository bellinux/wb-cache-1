50|$|It {{was after}} the First World War that {{countries}} began to follow the United States' lead in competition policy. In 1923, Canada introduced the Combines Investigation Act and in 1926 France reinforced its basic <b>competition</b> <b>provisions</b> from the 1810 Code Napoleon. After World War II, the Allies, led by the United States, introduced tight regulation of cartels and monopolies in occupied Germany and Japan. In Germany, despite the existence of laws against unfair business practices and unfair competition passed in 1909 (Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb or UWG) it was widely believed that the predominance of large cartels of German industry had {{made it easier for}} the Nazis to assume total economic control simply by bribing or blackmailing the heads of a small number of industrial magnates. Similarly in Japan, where business was organised along family and nepotistic ties, the zaibatsu were easy for the government to manipulate into the war effort. Following World War II and the unconditional surrender of Japan and Germany, tighter controls, replicating the existing American policies and regulations were introduced.|$|E

50|$|To {{all these}} challenges, the Commission has {{responded with a}} {{strategy}} to decentralise {{the implementation of the}} Competition rules through the so-called Modernisation Regulation. EU Council Regulation 1/2003 places National Competition Authorities and Member State national courts {{at the heart of the}} enforcement of Arts 101 & 102. Decentralised enforcement has for long been the usual way for other EC rules, Reg 1/2003 finally extended this to Competition Law as well. The Commission still retained an important role in the enforcement mechanism, as the co-ordinating force in the newly created European Competition Network (ECN). This Network, made up of the national bodies plus the Commission, manages the flow of information between NCAs and maintains the coherence and integrity of the system. At the time, Competition Commissioner Mario Monti hailed this regulation as one that will 'revolutionise' the enforcement of Arts 101 & 102. Since May 2004, all NCAs and national courts are empowered to fully apply the <b>Competition</b> <b>provisions</b> of the EC Treaty. In its 2005 report, the OECD lauded the modernisation effort as promising, and noted that decentralisation helps to redirect resources so the DG Competition can concentrate on complex, Community-wide investigations. Yet most recent developments shed doubt on the efficacy of the new arrangements. For instance, on 20 December 2006, the Commission publicly backed down from 'unbundling' French (EdF) and German (E.ON) energy giants, facing tough opposition from Member State governments. Another legal battle is currently ongoing over the E.ON-Endesa merger, where the Commission has been trying to enforce the free movement of capital, while Spain firmly protects its perceived national interests. It remains to be seen whether NCAs will be willing to challenge their own national 'champion companies' under EC Competition Law, or whether patriotic feelings prevail.|$|E

40|$|Political economy {{research}} has long argued that regional trade agreements (RTAs) {{can contribute to}} domestic reform in developing countries. With the increase in scope and depth of regional trade agreements and the increasingly common practice of including new policy areas like competition policy in RTAs, this argument has gained new traction. However, despite the increased scholarly interest, there is still little knowledge about whether and how provisions in RTAs affect domestic change. This thesis contributes to this line of research by analysing how <b>competition</b> <b>provisions</b> in regional trade agreements between the European Union and Southern countries impact {{on the development of}} the Southern competition regimes. By combining different theories and research approaches on how regional trade agreements impact domestic reform, the analytical framework provides a detailed account on the type of change that takes place, the mechanisms through which change occurs, and the different types of actors that participate in this process. The research relies on two case studies: the EU-Morocco Association Agreement on the one hand, and the EU-Cariforum Economic Partnership Agreement on the other. The thesis finds that <b>competition</b> <b>provisions</b> in regional trade agreements were relevant in both cases for the development of competition regimes. However, the findings also suggest that the influence of the <b>competition</b> <b>provisions</b> is contingent on two other factors: the surrounding environment in which the regional trade agreement is embedded, and the presence of domestic actors that are willing to promote reform. The fact that the <b>competition</b> <b>provisions</b> in the EU-Morocco trade agreement were embedded in the European Neighbourhood Policy and, importantly, that a follow-up regional trade agreement with the European Union was envisaged for the future, implied that the EU had a stronger leverage to demand change from the Moroccan government. Moreover, in both Morocco and Cariforum, the interest of governments in advancing competition policy reform was limited. Therefore, domestic actors other than the government played a key role in ensuring that the <b>competition</b> <b>provisions</b> had an impact {{on the development of the}} respective competition regimes. In sum, the thesis makes an important theoretical and empirical contribution to the literature. First, it empirically adds to the literature that looks at the consequences of <b>competition</b> <b>provisions</b> in regional trade agreements by making in-depths analyses of two trade agreements. Second, it develops the literature on the impact of regional trade agreements on domestic reform by explaining how <b>competition</b> <b>provisions</b> can have an impact on domestic reform, even in situations when the government is not interested. Finally, it also contributes to the literature by showing the importance of serial trade agreements for domestic reform, an aspect that has previously been overlooked...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the extracurricular {{business}} plan competition (BPC), a common feature on university campuses worldwide. While such competitions seek to engender entrepreneurial learning and start-up activity there is growing scepticism regarding their utility, {{largely as a result}} of overemphasis on the written business plan which can be counterproductive to achieving entrepreneurial activity and learning which competitions seek to encourage, raising the question what a more appropriate model might be. The paper explores the conceptual rationale for such a view, against the backdrop of an effectual turn within entrepreneurship and suggests how effectuation could be translated and embedded within <b>competition</b> practice and <b>provision.</b> A key assertion is that emphasis within <b>competition</b> <b>provision</b> should shift from the action of business plan production toward business implementation. Five guiding principles are offered defining how an implementation competition could be operationalised, embedding implementation in the ‘here and now’ of competition experience rather than assuming it may follow in the future. It is argued that the ‘implementation competition’ would be better placed to achieve current BPC objectives, reducing action deferral and promoting the idea that ‘anything is possible within the context of now’, encouraging a more seamless transition between competition participation and post-competition entrepreneurship...|$|R

40|$|On 15 October 2001, the Prime Minister {{announced}} {{that there would}} be an independent review of the <b>competition</b> <b>provisions</b> of the Trade Practices Act 1974 and their administration. The Treasurer announced the terms of reference for the review and the membership of the review Committee on 9 May 2002. The Committee reported to the Government by the end of January 2003. The Committee 2 ̆ 7 s Report was released in April 2003. A Commonwealth Government Response has been released. The <b>competition</b> <b>provisions</b> of the Trade Practices Act  1974 (the Act) have helped to shape economic activity in Australia since 1974. Competitive markets make an important contribution to increasing efficiency and productivity in the economy, thereby improving the welfare of Australians. This has been evident in the contribution that more competitive markets have made to the strong performance of the Australian economy over the past decade. The recent gains have been achieved following structural reform of the economy and have been accompanied by changes to the regulatory framework. These have included the extension of the <b>competition</b> <b>provisions</b> to apply to all business activity in Australia. Whilst the changing environment of Australian business has provided substantial opportunities for investment, it has also presented some challenges. Corporations must respond to developments in market conditions that may occur quickly and may be influenced by international, as well as domestic, competition. For some businesses, including those in industries that have experienced significant structural change, the new environment involves dealing in less regulated markets or with large businesses that have greater market power. In accordance with its terms of reference, the Committee has reviewed the competition and authorisation provisions of the Act to establish whether they meet the needs of business in the current environment or whether improvements might be made to ensure that they are effective. The Committee has also had regard {{to the way in which}} the <b>competition</b> <b>provisions</b> and related aspects of the Act have been administered. The Committee has drawn on a broad range of views expressed in submissions made to it, in discussions overseas and in consultations with a wide range of interested parties. Contributions were made by business, both big and small, and other parties, including the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), governments, consumer representatives, the professions and individuals. Paragraph 1 (c) of the terms of reference required the Committee to consider whether the <b>competition</b> <b>provisions</b> promote competitive trading which benefits consumers in terms of service and price. The Committee 2 ̆ 7 s conclusions and recommendations are set out at the end of each chapter of the report. Overall, the Committee considers that the <b>competition</b> <b>provisions</b> have served Australians well. The Act has sustained a competitive environment which has benefited consumers in terms of service and price. In doing so, it has achieved an appropriate balance between the prohibition of anti-competitive conduct and the encouragement of competition. The regime established by the Act compares favourably with competition regimes in other countries, allowing for the differences in the various legal systems. At the same time, the Committee has recommended changes to the competition and authorisation provisions by way of improvement and some changes to administrative arrangements to meet concerns expressed to the Committee...|$|E

The European Union's (EU's) capacity to rise to this challenge depends on the international mode of governance it decides to pursue and the determination with which it does so. The EU {{has always been a}} strong advocate of competition law within a WTO context. Recently, however, it has been far more active on a bilateral level, embedding <b>competition</b> <b>provisions</b> in a wide array of agreements.

This article aims to contribute to the debate on whether, and if so, how competition regulation should fit into the global trade scheme, by focusing on competition chapters in FTAs. In order to fully assess their value, this contribution first analyses the need for such provisions, following which the past attempts of integrating competition in a trade context are studied, finally proceeding to an analysis and assessment of competition chapters in a selection of bilateral FTAs...|$|E

40|$|The competition-related {{provisions}} in the TRIPS Agreement were very much influenced by {{the context in which}} the Agreement was concluded. The inclusion of <b>competition</b> <b>provisions</b> served a specific purpose. Competition law was basically seen as a tool to facilitate the transfer of technology. Twenty years after the entry into force of TRIPS, the legal landscape within which IPRs are exercised has experienced tremendous changes on the IP front, as well as on the competition law front. IP protection tends to be raised beyond the minimum standards of TRIPS, questionable protection has been granted specially in the field of patents, enforcement mechanisms and remedies have been strengthened and IP portfolios are strategically used in the markets. From an international perspective, higher IP standards have been exported through bilateral and regional trade agreements. Competition law is developing at a very fast speed, especially in emerging and developing economies. Moreover, competition law and IP laws are increasingly understood as being complementary to each other. A strict and “conflict oriented” reading of TRIPS’ <b>competition</b> <b>provisions</b> does not help to cope with the new strategies of innovation and the new forms of use of IPRs. We argue in this paper that a flexible reading of the competition-related {{provisions in}} TRIPS provides enough room for applying competition law as an innovation instrument. Hence, the application of competition law to combat IP-related restraints of competition that inhibit innovation would be covered by the rationale of the TRIPS Agreement just as much as an application of competition law aimed at enhancing access to and dissemination of IP-protected products...|$|E
