5|$|No. 81 Wing RAAF is {{headquartered}} at RAAF Williamtown. It commands No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit, {{based at}} RAAF Williamtown, flying F/A-18A and F/A-18B aircraft, No. 3 Squadron, based at RAAF Williamtown, flying F/A-18 aircraft, No. 75 Squadron, based at RAAF Base Tindal, flying F/A-18 aircraft, and No. 77 Squadron, based at RAAF Williamtown, flying F/A-18 aircraft. 81 Wing {{is responsible for}} the provision of combat air power to Australian and coalition forces through Offensive <b>Counter</b> <b>Air</b> (OCA) and Defensive <b>Counter</b> <b>Air</b> (DCA) operations using three squadrons of F/A-18 Hornets, Nos. 3, 75 and 77 Squadrons.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese Air Force {{operated}} the A-7 {{primarily in the}} tactical air support for maritime operations and air interdiction roles, with air defense and <b>counter</b> <b>air</b> operations as a secondary role. These aircraft were operated by 302 Squadron, replacing the F-86F Sabre, and 304 Squadron, later created to operate the A-7, and served alongside the Fiat G.91 until this aircraft's retirement in 1993.|$|E
25|$|The {{third wave}} of the PAF <b>counter</b> <b>air</b> strikes were {{directed}} to strike Ambala, Agra and Halwara around 18:00 hrs and continued in single or two ship formations through the evening until at least 22:30 hrs. These strikes involved fifteen B-57 Canberras, four T-33s, and one C-130. The B-57s flew seven single ship sorties. These caused significant damage, especially in Uttarlai, and Halwara and impeded IAF's preparation for retaliation.|$|E

5000|$|Offensive Counterair (OCA) {{is defined}} as [...] "offensive {{operations}} to destroy, disrupt, or neutralize enemy aircraft, missiles, launch platforms, and their supporting structures and systems {{both before and after}} launch, but as close to their source as possible" [...] (JP 1-02). OCA is the preferred method of <b>countering</b> <b>air</b> and missile threats, since it attempts to defeat the enemy closer to its source and typically enjoys the initiative. OCA comprises attack operations, sweep, escort, and suppression/destruction of enemy air defense.|$|R

CVW-3 made four deployments aboard Harry S. Truman to the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean between 2004 and 2010.|$|E
25|$|To <b>counter</b> <b>air</b> {{raids on}} London during World War I, E. B. Ashmore {{constructed}} a system {{known as the}} London Air Defence Area (LADA). Ashmore put defensive weapons into three rings around the city, searchlights and anti-aircraft artillery in the outer ring, fighter aircraft in the middle ring, and the innermost ring in the city contained more anti-aircraft guns. Ashmore set up a large plotting table at Horse Guards in London. Information from spotters was relayed to this central room where wooden blocks were placed on a large map to indicate the location of aircraft and other information. Observers around the map could relay this information to one of 25 regional control rooms, who re-created the portions of the map relevant to them and passed {{the information to the}} various weapons in their region.|$|E
25|$|This policy {{made the}} {{assumptions}} that an open conflict with India would {{not last long}} due to international pressure, and since East Pakistan was undefendable, the war-effort should be concentrated on occupying as large an area of Indian territory as possible as a bargaining tool at the negotiating table. To this end, Gen. Tikka Khan had proposed an offensive into India, and the PAF's overriding priority was to give maximum support to this offensive. The initial plans for the offensive called {{for at least a}} temporary cover of air dominance by the PAF under which Khan's troops could conduct a lightning campaign deep into Western India before digging in and consolidating their positions. In order to achieve air dominance, Pakistan decided to launch an offensive <b>counter</b> <b>air</b> strike codenamed Operation Chengiz Khan on Indian airbases.|$|E

5000|$|In the U.S. Air Force, an {{electronic}} warfare officer (EWO) is a trained aerial navigator who has received training in enemy threat systems, electronic warfare principles and overcoming enemy air defense systems [...] These officers are specialists in finding, identifying and <b>countering</b> <b>air</b> defense systems and also radar-, infrared- and optically guided surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft artillery {{as well as}} enemy fighter planes. In aircraft that could penetrate enemy airspace EWOs protect their aircraft using radar jamming, chaff and flares to deceive potential threats. In other aircraft EWOs work to gather intelligence information on potential enemy air defense systems and communication systems.|$|R

As a final irony, {{in the last years}} of its use, replacement vacuum tubes had to be purchased from Soviet-bloc countries where they were still being widely manufactured.|$|R
25|$|The Northwestern Front, Red Army, {{attempted}} {{to relieve the}} pressure in the Novgorod sector. It launched a counterattack near Staraya Russa. All of Fliegerkorps VIII was thrown into countering the attack supplemented by KG 76 and KG 77 from Fliegerkorps I. The attacks destroyed the Soviet concentrations. I./KG 4 conducted rolling attacks all over the front which had a devastating effect on Soviet troop’s positions. Do 17s from KG 2 destroyed 18 tanks in one mission on 17 August. The Luftwaffe also maintained pressure on local airfields to maintain air superiority. ZG 26 destroyed 20 Soviet aircraft and damaged 13 more on 19 August, though the Germans claimed 40 for one loss. The next day another 18 were destroyed in <b>counter</b> <b>air</b> operations by ZG 26. Fliegerkorps I also contributed decisively to the battle, attacking and destroying Soviet rail traffic.|$|E
25|$|Strategic bombing {{could have}} been carried out during the first {{surprise}} operations in June 1941, especially on those Soviet armament works that lay within range of the He 111; near Moscow and Voronezh. However, the need for <b>counter</b> <b>air</b> and ground support operations predominated in German air thinking. Hitler demanded close air support for the army, implying at least one Air Corps should be attached to each of the three Army Groups. There were four Air Corps (or Fliegerkorps) in the Soviet Union, giving one possible reserve Corps. Had production been brought up to a level commensurate with total war in 1940 and early 1941, a reserve of one Air Corps {{could have been}} set aside for strategic operations to commence with air-land operations. The splitting of tactical and strategic air units, the later being formed into one unified air command, would have done much to clarify the problem of organisation. The Strategic air units could have been freed from ground support duties which they were not trained or equipped for, while being able to carry out strategic bombing as advocated by the late General Wever. The concept of concentrating all available forces for the army, in the decisive battle became invalid, since it was the ability of the Soviets to re-arm and rebuild, through the failure of the Axis to bomb industrial regions beyond the front, that contributed to ultimate failure of Barbarossa to win a decisive victory. It was not until the winter, 1941-42 that Jeschonnek and Hitler revisited the idea of producing a heavy bomber to hit far ranging targets. Fliegerkorps IV was finally ready for operations after the publication of the Luftwaffe study Battle against Russian Armaments Industry in November 1943. However, the project was abandoned as there was no capable aircraft.|$|E

500|$|After battle sequences, {{the player}} {{will have the}} {{opportunity}} to rebuild their units by allocating a quantity of armament supplies, such as air support, which can be issued to any friendly unit on the map. After rebuilding ground units, the game will move onto an [...] "air phase", which consists of commanding aircraft such as aeroplanes, bombers and a limited number of reserve air units. Several options for allocating air forces include: <b>counter</b> <b>air</b> strikes, reconnaissance on enemy movement, interdiction, assault breakers, and deep strikes. <b>Counter</b> <b>air</b> strikes involve attacks on enemy air bases, whereas interdiction involves aircraft being sent behind enemy lines in order to attack supply and movement networks. If interdiction aircraft are discovered in enemy territory, there will be a chance that the side will respond with a retaliatory nuclear strike. The remaining three aircraft options are to attack a single unit, strike enemy territory, and attack railways in order to disable enemy reinforcements, respectively.|$|E
500|$|The Japanese {{military}} began transferring fighter {{aircraft to}} the home islands from China and the Pacific in early 1944 in anticipation of B-29 raids. Japanese intelligence detected the construction of B-29 bases in India and China, and the military began to develop plans to <b>counter</b> <b>air</b> raids originating from China. The three IJAAF air brigades stationed in Honshū and Kyūshū were expanded to air divisions between March and June (these were designated the 10th, 11th and 12th Air Divisions). By late June the air defense units in the home islands were assigned 260 fighters, and could draw on approximately 500 additional aircraft during emergencies. Additional anti-aircraft gun batteries and searchlight units were also established to protect major cities and military bases. The GDC's authority was strengthened when the army units in the Eastern, Central and Western military districts were placed under its command in May. The IJN defensive fighter units stationed at Kure, Sasebo and Yokosuka were also assigned to the GDC in July, but cooperation between the GDC's Army units and the much smaller number of naval units was poor. Despite these improvements, Japan's air defenses remained inadequate as few aircraft and anti-aircraft guns could effectively engage B-29s at their cruising altitude of [...] {{and the number of}} radar stations capable of providing early warning of raids was insufficient.|$|E
