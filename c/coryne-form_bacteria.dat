The portal of entry was likely through Tenckhoff catheters. 16 S rRNA and secA 1 gene sequencing are so far the most reliable methods for the accurate identification ofGordonia species. Gordonia species are Gram-positive weakly acid-fast <b>coryne-form</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Although Gordonia species have been impli-cated {{in a variety of}} infections, only seven cases of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) -related peritonitis caused by Gordonia species have been described (1 – 4). Furthermore, the methods used for identifying these seven Gordonia isolates were not mentioned in five cases (2, 4), and the accuracy of the identi-fications could not be ascertained. In this article, we described four cases of CAPD-related peritonitis caused by three different species of Gordonia confirmed by 16 S rRNA and secA 1 gene sequencing. Clinical specimens were collected and handled according to standard protocols, and the clinical data were collected by analyz-ing the patients ’ hospital records. Phenotypic identification wa...|$|E
40|$|C. ulcerans is {{considered}} to be a zoonotic patho-gen, molecular indication for zoonotic transmission has Germany Full list of author information is available at the end of the articleBackground Diphtheria is the most severe disease attributed to <b>coryne-form</b> <b>bacteria</b> [1]. Although Corynebacterium diphtheriae is the classical pathogen described to cause diphtheria, Corynebacterium ulcerans has also been found to cause diphtheria-like illness in humans. Moreover, in recent years cases of human diphtheria caused by C. ulcerans seem to outnumber those caused by C. diphtheriae in many industrialized countries, including the United Kingdom [2], France [3], the US [4] and Germany [5]. In contrast to C. diphtheriae, which to date has been found nearly exclusively in humans, C. ulcerans is often found in domestic animals, which are suspected to serve as reser-voirs for possible zoonotic infection. Among those animals were cats, dogs and pigs [6 - 11]. Additionally, C. ulcerans has also been found in other non-domestic animals, such as cynomolgus macaques [12] and ferrets [13], and in game animals, such as wild boars and roe deer [14]. Al...|$|E
