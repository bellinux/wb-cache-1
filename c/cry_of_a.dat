25|$|Chicken {{has played}} an {{important}} role as a protein in Korean history, evidenced by a number of myths. One myth tells of the birth of Kim Alji, founder of the Kim family of Gyeongju being announced by the <b>cry</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> white chicken. As the birth of a clan's founder is always announced by an animal with preternatural qualities, this myth speaks to the importance of chicken in Korean culture. Chicken is often served roasted or braised with vegetables or in soups. All parts of the chicken are used in Korean cuisine, including the gizzard, liver, and feet. Young chickens are braised with ginseng and other ingredients in medicinal soups eaten during the summer months to combat heat called samgyetang. The feet of the chicken, called dakbal (닭발), are often roasted and covered with hot and spicy gochujang-based sauce and served as an anju, or side dish, to accompany alcoholic beverages, especially soju.|$|E

500|$|According to Kertzer, {{the proponents}} of this pro-Church {{narrative}} {{did not seem to}} realise that to many these accounts sounded [...] "too good to be true" [...] and [...] "absurd." [...] Kertzer comments: [...] "If Edgardo in fact told his father {{that he did not want}} to return with him, that he now regarded the Pope as his true father and wanted to devote his life to converting the Jews, this message seems not to have registered with Momolo." [...] Liberals, Protestants and Jews across the continent ridiculed the Catholic press reports. A booklet published in Brussels in 1859 outlined the two contrasting narratives, then concluded: [...] "Between the miracle of a six-year-old apostle who wants to convert the Jews and the <b>cry</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child who keeps asking for his mother and his little sisters, we don't hesitate for a moment." [...] Mortara's parents furiously denounced the Catholic accounts as lies, but some of their supporters were less certain about where Edgardo's loyalties now lay. These included Scazzocchio, who had attended some of the disputed meetings at the Catechumens.|$|E
500|$|Gray wolves howl to {{assemble}} the pack (usually before and after hunts), to pass on an alarm (particularly at a den site), to locate each other during a storm or unfamiliar territory and to communicate across great distances. Wolf howls can under certain conditions be heard over areas of up to [...] Wolf howls are generally indistinguishable from those of large dogs. Male wolves give voice through an octave, passing to a deep bass with a stress on [...] "O", while females produce a modulated nasal baritone with stress on [...] "U". Pups almost never howl, while yearling wolves produce howls ending {{in a series of}} dog-like yelps. Howling consists of a fundamental frequency that may lie between 150 and 780Hz, and consists of up to 12 harmonically related overtones. The pitch usually remains constant or varies smoothly, and may change direction as many as four or five times. Howls used for calling pack mates to a kill are long, smooth sounds similar {{to the beginning of the}} <b>cry</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> horned owl. When pursuing prey, they emit a higher pitched howl, vibrating on two notes. When closing in on their prey, they emit a combination of a short bark and a howl. When howling together, wolves harmonize rather than chorus on the same note, thus creating the illusion of there being more wolves than there actually are. Lone wolves typically avoid howling in areas where other packs are present. Wolves from different geographic locations may howl in different fashions: the howls of European wolves are much more protracted and melodious than those of North American wolves, whose howls are louder and have a stronger emphasis on the first syllable. The two are however mutually intelligible, as North American wolves have been recorded to respond to European-style howls made by biologists.|$|E
