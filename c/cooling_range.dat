40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe fact that typhoons cause a cooling {{of the upper}} oceanic layers during their passage is well documented. This case study establishes {{the magnitude of this}} cooling for 17 western Pacific super-typhoons during the period 1968 to 1972. Digitized bathythermograph (BT) records for the typhoons were screened to acquire points before and after typhoon passage that met selection criteria. The selected BT records were then assigned a weight that reflected the number of hours before or after the typhoon passed its closest point of approach (CPA). The resulting data file for the 17 typhoons was analyzed using several techniques. It was found that there is a positive correlation between the magnitude of mixed-layer cooling and the distance from the typhoon path, as well as with wind velocity at the BT site.

40|$|Horticultural produce {{begins to}} {{deteriorate}} {{as soon as}} it is harvested. It begins to lose its flavour and texture, and it is susceptible to infection by pathogens. An effective method of slowing the loss in quality is to cool the produce as soon as possible after harvest. Many crops, such as pome fruits, asparagus, broccoli, peas and beans can be cooled within half an hour or so by drenching them with chilled water in a device known as a hydrocooler. The project described in this report was initiated by Mr Nick Christou of Christou Logistical Services. He was using a water chilling unit to cool water which he sprayed onto vegetables after which the water was discharged. This procedure was a waste of water and energy. He required a hydrocooler capable of cooling up to 6 tonnes per hour of produce, and that is transportable from growing region to growing region, and which is water-efficient. The Smart Water Fund grant enabled a hydrocooler that incorporated water recirculation to be developed and built jointly by Victoria University and Wobelea Pty Ltd. The strategy of recirculating water has reduced the water consumption from a required 60, 000 litres per tonne of broccoli cooled to about 75 litres per tonne. When round fruit such as apples are cooled the water consumption is estimated to be about 35 litres per tonne. Measurements show that broccoli cools by 80 % of its possible <b>cooling</b> <b>range,</b> i. e. from 30 ÂºC when sprayed with water at 0 ÂºC, in about 35 minutes. The total electricity consumption is 20 kWh and 16 kWh when the throughputs are 4 tonnes per hour and 6 tonnes per hours respectively. If the water were not recirculated the electricity consumption would be about 300 kWh per tonne. Outcomes of the project include: The design and operation of a recirculating hydrocooling system. A demonstration that the new system cools horticultural produce to temperatures that will maintain the shelf life and quality of the produce. A demonstration that the hydrocooler is capabale of eliminating contaminants from the recirculated water over brief periods of time.

40|$|Electrical {{machines}} for aerospace applications often operate {{close to the}} allowable thermal limits due to high power density requirements. The power density of electrical machines is generally dependent on the machine and thermal management design. At flight level, a reduced pressure exists which in turn results in more challenging thermal management. Aerospace electric machine manufacturers are often limited {{with respect to the}} implemented cooling mechanisms. That is, natural convection systems are the norm, as fan cooled and fluid cooled machines may suffer from reliability issues. The original contribution of this work, is the design, testing, and implementation of an alternative forced cooling convective system (FCCS) based on piezoelectric fans. This thesis commences by an investigation of the capabilities of MotorCAD (a sophisticated analytical lumped thermal package) and how it can be utilised in a fully integrated way to optimise (for a maximum power density and an overall minimum motor mass) both the electromagnetic and thermal aspects of a typical traditional horizontally-mounted permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) operating at flight level. The resultant analytical temperature values were then compared to actual experimental temperature data. Piezoelectric fans are then investigated as a potential, fault tolerant FCCS that may enhance the overall cooling of a motor. These fans could be implemented in the aerospace industry as they do not suffer from the same reliability issues as traditional FFCS’s. Detailed thermal results indicating the effective piezoelectric fan <b>cooling</b> <b>range</b> together with the overall cooling effectiveness over a traditional vertical straight-finned heat sink (unit – cell), operating under different operating conditions are also presented. Furthermore, the fin/fan geometry that minimises the thermal resistance whilst minimising the overall cooling mass is presented. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) techniques were implemented to further understand the flow fields generated by an oscillating piezoelectric fan. Common parameters governing the fluid flow (vibration amplitude, separation distance, fin spacing and fan orientation) were investigated and the results are herewith presented. Designs of a supporting structure for the proposed FCCS implementation are drawn up and analysed through FEA. A prototype structure was built and its durability tested. Furthermore, the reliability (fault tolerance) of the suggested FCCS was evaluated. The feasibility of implementing this innovative cooling technique was further investigated by performing a study on the weight saving potential of the FCCS over traditional natural convective fins, and the FCCS geometry that minimises the thermal resistance whilst minimising the overall mass is selected. Furthermore, a prototype FCCS was built and tested. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyThe main {{contribution}} {{of this work}} is to answer several important questions relating to natural draft wet cooling tower (NDWCT) modelling, design and optimisation. Specifically, the work aims to conduct {{a detailed analysis of}} the heat and mass transfer processes in a NDWCT, to determine how significant the radial non-uniformity of heat and mass transfer across a NDWCT is, what the underlying causes of the non-uniformity are and how these influence tower performance. Secondly, the work aims to determine what are the consequences of this non-uniformity for the traditional one dimensional design methods, which neglect any two-dimensional air flow or heat transfer effects. Finally, in the context of radial non-uniformity of heat and mass transfer, this work aims to determine the optimal arrangement of fill depth and water distribution across a NDWCT and to quantify the improvement in tower performance using this non-uniform distribution. To this end, an axisymmetric numerical model of a NDWCT has been developed. A study was conducted testing the influence of key design and operating parameters. The results show that in most cases the air flow is quite uniform across the tower due to the significant flow restriction through the fill and spray zone regions. There can be considerable radial non-uniformity of heat transfer and water outlet temperature in spite of this. This is largely due to the cooling load in the rain zone and the radial air flow there. High radial non-uniformity of heat transfer can be expected when the cooling load in the rain zone is high. Such a situation can arise with small droplet sizes, low fill depths, high water flow rates. The results show that the effect of tower inlet height on radial non-uniformity is surprisingly very small. Of the parameters considered the water mass flow rate and droplet size and droplet distribution in the rain zone have the most influence on radial noniv uniformity of heat transfer. The predictions of the axisymmetric numerical model have been compared with a one dimensional NDWCT model. The difference between the predictions of tower <b>cooling</b> <b>range</b> is very low, generally around 1 - 2 %. This extraordinarily close comparison supports the assumptions of one dimensional flow and bulk averaged heat transfer implicit in these models. Under the range of parameters tested here the difference between the CFD models predictions and those of the one dimensional models remained fairly constant suggesting that there is no particular area where the flow/heat transfer becomes so skewed or non-uniform that the one dimensional model predictions begin to fail. An extended one dimensional model, with semi-two dimensional capability, has been developed for use with an evolutionary optimisation algorithm. The two dimensional characteristics are represented through a radial profile of the air enthalpy at the fill inlet which has been derived from the CFD results. The resulting optimal shape redistributes the fill volume from the tower centre to the outer regions near the tower inlet. The water flow rate is also increased here as expected, to balance the cooling load across the tower, making use of the cooler air near the inlet. The improvement {{has been shown to be}} very small however. The work demonstrates that, contrary to common belief, the potential improvement from multi-dimensional optimisation is actually quite small...|$|E
