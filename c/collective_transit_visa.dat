50|$|Despite this, the Japanese Consul in Kaunas, Lithuania, Chiune Sugihara, {{began to}} issue <b>transit</b> <b>visas</b> to {{escaping}} Jews against orders from Tokyo. These {{allowed them to}} travel to Japan and stay for a limited time {{on their way to}} their final destination, the Dutch colony of Curaçao, which required no entry visa. Thousands of Jews received <b>transit</b> <b>visas</b> from him, or through similar means. Some even copied, by hand, the visa that Sugihara had written. After receiving exit visas from the Soviet government, many Jews were allowed to cross Russia on the Trans-Siberian Railway, taking a boat from Vladivostok to Tsuruga and eventually settling in Kobe, Japan.|$|R
50|$|While the Soviets {{agreed to}} honor the Curaçao visas, they insisted that the visa holders also have a <b>transit</b> <b>visa</b> to a country outside Russia.

Sugihara worked in {{conjunction}} with Zwartendijk to issue 2,200 <b>transit</b> <b>visas</b> to Japan, with Curaçao as the final destination. With these visas, Jews were able to obtain exit visas from the Soviet government and take the Trans-Siberian Railway to Vladivostok, destination Kobe, Japan. None of the visa holders actually reached Curaçao.|$|R
