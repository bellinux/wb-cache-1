40|$|Abstract—Most of today’s {{approaches}} to sensor-based motion planning focus on kinematic and geometric issues {{and ignore the}} system dynamics. Those few that address dynamics {{do so in a}} two-stage fashion by considering one issue at the time. This work attempts to incorporate control of body dynamics into the sensor-based motion planning process. A point mobile robot is assumed to operate in a planar environment with unknown arbitrary stationary obstacles. Based on its <b>current</b> velocity and <b>sensory</b> <b>data</b> about the surrounding obstacles, the robot plans its motion to locally maximize the turning angle toward the current intermediate target. An optimal braking procedure takes care of sudden potential collisions by guaranteeing a safe emergency stopping path. Given the constraints on robot’s dynamics, sensing, and control means, conditions are formulated for generating trajectories that guarantee convergence and the robot’s safety at all times. The approach calls for continuous computation and is fast enough for real-time implementation. Simulated examples demonstrate its performance.

For a robot {{to walk in}} a varying terrain, it is desirable that the robot can adapt to any environment encountered in real-time. This paper aims to develop a sensory mapping unit to recognize environment types from the input sensory data based on an artificial neural network approach. With the proposed sensory mapping design, a bipedal walking robot can obtain real-time environment information and select an appropriate walking pattern accordingly. Due to the time-dependent property of sensory data, the sensory mapping is realized by using a time-delay neural network. The sensory data of earlier time sequences combined with <b>current</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>data</b> are sent to the neural network.

30|$|A {{strategy}} of double cross {{to collect data}} for industrial wireless sensor networks was proposed by Shi et al. [17]. In this strategy, the authors introduced the double-blind concept where the source nodes and mobile sink do not know each other’s location. The authors provided the scheme of a random line walk (RLW), {{which is used to}} transmit the <b>sensory</b> <b>data.</b> When a source node needs to upload the <b>sensory</b> <b>data,</b> it randomly chooses a direction to establish the baseline. The source nodes transmit <b>sensory</b> <b>data</b> in two directions in that baseline. On the basis of the RLW, the authors proposed the {{strategy of}} double cross. This strategy enables source nodes to be associated with a mobile sink. When a source node detects an event, it selects one direction randomly and transfers the <b>sensory</b> <b>data</b> along that direction and its vertical direction by the RLW mechanism. All sensor nodes on the transmission path cache the <b>sensory</b> <b>data.</b> When mobile sink needs <b>sensory</b> <b>data,</b> it transmits the query information. The query information is also transmitted in two directions, which are perpendicular to each other, according to the RLW mechanism. The query path and the <b>sensory</b> <b>data</b> routing path intersect at a sensor node. If the intersection sensor node receives both the query information and <b>sensory</b> <b>data,</b> the <b>sensory</b> <b>data</b> will be transmitted to mobile sink. In this strategy, too many sensor nodes need cache and relay <b>sensory</b> <b>data</b> to find the mobile sink; thus, energy is wasted, and transmission delay is large.|$|R
40|$|Global {{localization}} is {{a fundamental}} requirement for a mobile robot. Map-based global localization is a popular technique and gives a precise position by comparing a provided geometric map and <b>current</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>data.</b> However, it is quite time-consuming if 3 D range data is processed for 6 D global localization. On the other hand, appearance-based global localization using a captured image and recorded images is simple and suitable for real-time processing. However, this technique does not work in the dark or in {{an environment in which}} the lighting conditions change remarkably. To cope with these problems, we have proposed a two-step strategy which combines map-based global localization and appearance-based global localization. Firstly, several candidate positions are selected according to an appearance-based technique, and then the optimum position is determined by a map-based technique. Instead of camera images, we use reflectance images, which are captured by a laser range finder as a by-product of range sensing. In this paper, a new technique based on this global localization technique is proposed by combining the two step algorithm and a sampling-based approach. To cope with the odometry data, a particle filter is adopted for tracking robot positions. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is demonstrated through experiments in real environments...|$|E
40|$|Wireless sensor networks, {{serving as}} an {{important}} interface between physical environments and computational systems, have been used extensively for supporting domain applications, where multiple-attribute <b>sensory</b> <b>data</b> are queried from the network continuously and periodically.
