5|$|The Yugoslav coup d'état {{occurred}} on 27 March 1941 in Belgrade, Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The coup was planned and {{conducted by a}} group of pro-Western Serb-nationalist Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers formally led by its commander, General Dušan Simović, who had been associated with a number of coup plots from 1938 onwards. For practical purposes Brigadier General of Military Aviation Borivoje Mirković, Major Živan Knežević of the Yugoslav Royal Guards, and his brother Radoje Knežević all performed leadership roles in the conduct of the coup. In addition to Radoje Knežević, some other <b>civilian</b> <b>leaders</b> were probably aware of the coup before it was launched and moved to support it once it occurred, but they were not among the organisers.|$|E
5|$|The 1970 {{election}} {{included all}} of the <b>civilian</b> <b>leaders</b> of the country since independence with Apithy, Ahomadégbé, Maga, and Zinsou running against one another. The military decided to hold the elections on a staggered schedule with {{different areas of the}} country voting on different dates. This staggering meant that each of the candidates strategically tried to gain votes in later voting regions based upon the earlier results: bribery and irregularities in the election were rampant. Just before voting began in Atakora, the last department to vote which was a stronghold for Maga, Ahomadégbé supporters instigated violence to undercut turnout. Maga would have won the presidency if he had earned the most votes in Atakora, but instead of allowing the vote to go forward, de Souza suspended the election and immediately called on all sides to come to an agreement forming the next government.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} of May19 there were further discussions at Rodríguez Peña's house. Saavedra, called by Viamonte, joined the meeting, which {{involved}} military and <b>civilian</b> <b>leaders.</b> They arranged that Belgrano and Saavedra would meet with Juan José de Lezica, the senior alcalde (municipal magistrate), while Castelli would meet with the procurator Julián de Leiva, to ask for their support. They asked the Viceroy to allow an open cabildo, and said {{that if it was}} not freely granted the people and the criollo troops would march to the Plaza, force the Viceroy to resign by any means necessary, and replace him with a patriot government. Saavedra commented to Lezica that he was suspected of betrayal because of his constant requests for cautious and measured steps. This comment was designed to pressure Lezica into speeding up the legal system to allow the people to express themselves, or otherwise risk a major rebellion. Lezica asked for patience and time to persuade the Viceroy, and leave a massive demonstration as a last resort. He argued that if the Viceroy was deposed in that way, it would constitute a rebellion, which would turn the revolutionaries into outlaws. Manuel Belgrano gave the following Monday as the deadline to confirm the open cabildo before taking direct action. Leiva would later act as a mediator, being both a confidante of Cisneros and a trusted negotiator for the more moderate revolutionaries.|$|E
25|$|Continued {{pressure}} from African-American <b>civilian</b> <b>leaders</b> led the Army to let blacks train {{as members of}} bomber crews, a step that opened many more skilled combat roles to them. On January 15, 1944, the Army re-activated the 477th Bombardment Group (Medium) to train African-American aviators to fly the B-25J Mitchell twin-engine medium bomber in combat.|$|E

25|$|Upon the {{proclamation}} of the Republic, {{one of the}} <b>civilian</b> <b>leaders</b> of the movement, the lawyer Ruy Barbosa, proposed a design for the nation's new flag strongly inspired by {{the flag of the}} United States. It was flown from 15 November 1889, until 19 November 1889, when Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca (acting as provisional president of Brazil) vetoed the design, citing concerns that it looked too similar to the flag of another state.|$|E

The plane crashed while approaching Smolensk Air Base in Russia. The governor of Smolensk Oblast confirmed to the Russia 24 news channel that there were no survivors. 96 people were killed in the crash, including many of Poland's highest military and <b>civilian</b> <b>leaders.</b>|$|E
25|$|In early September {{the leading}} {{elements}} of Major General Geoffrey Charles Evans's Indian 7th Infantry Division landed, accompanied by Edwina Mountbatten. Later that month Seni Pramoj returned from Washington to succeed Tawee as prime minister. It {{was the first}} time in over a decade that the government had been controlled by civilians. But the ensuing factional scramble for power in late 1945 created political divisions in the ranks of the <b>civilian</b> <b>leaders</b> that destroyed their potential for making a common stand against the resurgent political force of the military in the post-war years.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{military}} advice, {{the idea of}} China winning the war with Japan swiftly {{with only a few}} American men and planes was tempting to <b>civilian</b> <b>leaders.</b> It was adopted by top civilian officials including Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and President Roosevelt himself. However, the American attack never took place: The Nationalist Chinese had not built and secured any runways or bases close enough to reach Japan, just as {{the military}} had warned. The bombers and crews arrived after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, and were used for the war in Burma, as they lacked the range to reach Japan from the secure bases in China.|$|E

25|$|In January 2011 the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, a German {{human rights}} group, sent a dossier {{detailing}} alleged war {{crimes committed by}} the 57 Division to the German Federal Foreign Office The ECCHR followed the military offensives as described by the Sri Lankan military, examined reports produced by the Sri Lankan government and NGOs, and talked to eyewitnesses present in the conflict area. The dossier concluded that many violations of international law were committed by the Sri Lankan military and the Tigers, particularly war crimes. The dossier supports {{the view of the}} US embassy in Colombo that the senior military and <b>civilian</b> <b>leaders</b> were responsible for these crimes. The dossier urges the German government to investigate Dias' individual criminal responsibility, withdraw his diplomatic visa and declare him persona non grata.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} State Department message {{stressed the}} need to publicly emphasize {{the fact that the}} coup was an expression of national will by citing the near unanimous support of key military and <b>civilian</b> <b>leaders.</b> The message further stressed the importance of Vice President Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ in a quick return to constitutional rule and the need, therefore, for the junta to include him in an interim regime. Lodge replied affirmatively, indicating the United States should encourage other friendly countries to publicly recognize the new junta first with the assurance that the US would follow suit shortly thereafter. The United States would then resume the Commercial Import Program (CIP) that had been suspended in the meantime. Lodge advised the CIP be resumed quietly to avoid the appearance that it was a payoff for the coup.|$|E
25|$|The United States and Britain {{came to a}} draw in the war after bitter {{fighting}} that lasted even after the Burning of Washington in August 1814 and Andrew Jackson's smashing defeat of the British invasion army at the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815. The Treaty of Ghent, officially ending the war, returned {{to the status quo}} ante bellum, but Britain's alliance with the Native Americans ended, and the Indians were the major losers of the war. News of the victory at New Orleans over the best British combat troops came {{at the same time as}} news of the peace, giving Americans a psychological triumph and opening the Era of Good Feelings. The war destroyed the Federalist Party, and opened roles as national candidates to generals Andrew Jackson and William Henry Harrison among others, as well as <b>civilian</b> <b>leaders</b> James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, and Henry Clay.|$|E

25|$|Despite those controversies and the {{apparent}} {{lessons learned from}} the Vietnam War, some theorists recognized a significant problem with Huntington's theory insofar as it appears to question the notion of a separate, apolitical professional military. While there is little argument that separate civilian and military worlds exist, there is significant debate about the proper interaction between the two. As discussed above, Huntington proposed that the ideal arrangement was one whereby civilian political leaders provided objective control to the military leadership and then stepped back to permit the experts in violence to do what was most effective. He further stated that the most dangerous arrangement was one whereby <b>civilian</b> <b>leaders</b> intruded extensively in the military world, creating a situation whereby the military leadership was not politically neutral and security of the nation was thus threatened both by an ineffective military and by provoking the military to avoid taking orders.|$|E
25|$|The President of the United States of America takes {{pleasure}} in presenting a Gold Star {{in lieu of}} a Second Award of the Legion of Merit to Rear Admiral Charles Elliott Loughlin (NSN: 0-72307/1100), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the Government of the United States from October 1966 to June 1968 as Commandant, Naval District, Washington, D.C. Exercising outstanding leadership, tact, and judgment, Rear Admiral Loughlin successfully directed and supervised the efforts of the large, diversified complex of naval activities that comprise his command, all of which are dedicated to the mission of Fleet support. Under his command, military-civilian relationships have been enhanced, leading to an increased awareness of the important role played by the Navy in the community. Rear Admiral Loughlin maintained close contact with <b>civilian</b> <b>leaders</b> in his area of coordination with a resultant increase in integrated off-base housing for military personnel. Further, he coordinated the Navy Youth Opportunity Program and Civil Disturbance Plan for his area of command. He established policies which encourage, and has personally fostered, the closest cooperation among the Navy and the other services as well as with civilian groups. By his outstanding leadership, foresight, and keen intellect, Rear Admiral Loughlin has significantly enhanced the material effectiveness of his complex command, and has upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E

His wartime experience reinforced his German patriotism and he was shocked by Germany's capitulation in November 1918.

Like other German nationalists, he believed the Dolchstoßlegende (stab-in-the-back myth), which claimed that the German army, [...] "undefeated in the field", had been [...] "stabbed in the back" [...] on the home front by <b>civilian</b> <b>leaders,</b> Jews, and Marxists, later dubbed the [...] "November criminals".|$|E
