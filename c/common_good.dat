5|$|Manuel Belgrano had a vast {{intellectual}} {{awareness of}} most important topics of his age. He studied in Europe during the Atlantic Revolutions, {{and was a}} versatile polyglot, capable of understanding Spanish, English, French, Italian, and some indigenous languages. This allowed him to read many influential books of the Age of Enlightenment, and understand the social, economic, technical, educative, political, cultural, and religious changes that were being prompted by the new ideas. He helped to promote those ideas using the press and with {{his work in the}} Consulate. He rejected localist perspectives, favouring a Latin Americanist one. He was driven by the concept of the <b>common</b> <b>good,</b> which he regarded as an ethical value. He considered public health, education, and work as part of the <b>common</b> <b>good,</b> as well as religion. He did not share completely the ideas of the French Revolution, but instead the tempered ones of the Spanish Enlightenment: most notably, he remained a monarchist and held strong religious beliefs, being Roman Catholic and a devotee of Marian theology. His monarchism was not a conservative one, as he agreed that the existing state of things should be modified, but not towards a republic as in France or the United States, but towards a constitutional monarchy, like in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In the {{economic}} field, the document addressed {{the lack of}} a bourgeoisie that could turn the political changes into economic development, and proposed to overcome this lack with strong state interventionism. Mariano Moreno proposed that the state invest 200 or 300 million in factories, manufacturing, arts, agriculture, navigation, and other critical areas. There would be no risk of bankruptcy because the state would manage the businesses. With the money generated, the state would then seek seeds and tools, and ultimately allow the continent to be economically autarchic. The initial money that the state would need to become such an active economic force would come from the mines in Potosi, where the slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million. Moreno proposed simply to confiscate the money and nationalize the mines. He reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action, but eighty or a hundred thousand would benefit. The state would not manage those areas indefinitely; Moreno proposed that this should be done only until there was a strong economic activity in each area, and then the state would just observe, making sure that they followed the laws enacted for the <b>common</b> <b>good</b> of society.|$|E

Police services as a <b>commons</b> <b>good</b> are modeled using the uncertainty about which calls for service are bona fide. The results are that optimal alarm systems per officer rise with the officers' wage, fall with the value of avoided losses and rise with the productivity of officers. Ceteris paribus, avoided losses are greater in the community with more alarm systems. Homogeneity of the community increases the optimal number of alarms per officer. Fining 'well-behaved' alarm owners more heavily increases police productivity.

50|$|In economics, {{open access}} {{resources}} are, {{for the most}} part, rivalrous, non-excludable goods. This makes them similar to <b>common</b> <b>goods</b> during times of prosperity.

However, as these resources are first come, first served, they may be affected by the phenomenon of the tragedy of the commons. Two possibilities may follow: a common property or an open access system.|$|R

Variations in this dimension are exemplified by three cases from environmental policy: global warming, biodiversity, and siting conflicts.

30|$|Nevertheless, {{these studies}} have brought to the fore the theme of <b>Common</b> <b>Goods,</b> {{material}} and immaterial, against the neoliberal policies focused on reducing public expenditure, regardless of recurring economic and social emergencies. Elinor Ostrom’s works (1990) have stressed the relevance of <b>Common</b> <b>Goods,</b> resulting in {{the recognition of the}} Australian Aborigines’ pre-capitalist collective rights, although their legalization was effected through written, rather than customary law. In Italy the subject was take up by Rodotà (2013), who defined <b>Common</b> <b>Goods</b> as being both material and immaterial goods, functional to the exercise of fundamental rights and the free development of personality, and as such to be guarded against destructive short-term logics and kept for future generations. This relevantly highlights the contradiction intrinsic to the expanding scope of private right: the monetization of all goods, to be found nowadays in the prevailing and all-pervading financial interests that, for the sake of market efficiency, are at risk of marginalizing all other concerns—both social and productive.|$|R

25|$|One {{solution}} for some resources is to convert <b>common</b> <b>good</b> into private property, giving {{the new owner}} an incentive to enforce its sustainability.

40|$|The task of {{identifying}} nonprofit organizations, voluntary action, and phil-anthropy {{as the principal}} constituents of a single "sector " within the larger economy, society, and polity has been a central challenge for the multidis-ciplinary paradigm {{that seems to be}} emerging in this field.

The commons is characterized by uncoerced participation, shared purposes and resources, mutuality, and fairness; the derivative concept of <b>common</b> <b>goods</b> is characterized as desir-able ends that are universal and indivisible within a commons but not nec-essarily beyond.
