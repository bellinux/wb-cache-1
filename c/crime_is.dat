5|$|Crime in Paris {{is similar}} to that in most large cities. Violent <b>crime</b> <b>is</b> {{relatively}} rare in the city centre.

50|$|Based on the Code, <b>crimes</b> <b>were</b> {{classified}} {{under three}} headings: delicts, misdemeanors and contraventions. The concept of attempted <b>crimes</b> <b>was</b> not mentioned throughout the code; attempting {{to commit a}} <b>crime</b> <b>was</b> punished just as harshly as if the crime happened. The accomplice was to receive the same punishment {{as the author of}} the crime.|$|R

5|$|The {{title of}} the episode is an homage to Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel Last Exit to Brooklyn, one subplot of which {{involves}} the corruption and downfall of a union leader during a strike. The body of the union president is seen buried under a football field, a homage to the mystery surrounding the whereabouts of Jimmy Hoffa and his alleged burial at New Jersey's Giants Stadium. Mr. Burns' outfit in the flashback to his childhood is based on Buster Brown. Homer's imagination of a life of organized <b>crime</b> <b>is</b> based on Don Fanucci's first appearance in The Godfather Part II, accepting donuts rather than a necklace and an orange.|$|E
5|$|According to the Augustan History, Odaenathus {{was assassinated}} by a cousin named Maeonius. In Augustan History, Odaenathus' son {{from his first}} wife was named Herodes and was crowned co-ruler by his father. The Augustan History claims that Zenobia conspired with Maeonius for a time {{because she did not}} accept her stepson as his father's heir (ahead of her own children). The Augustan History does not suggest that Zenobia was {{involved}} in the events leading to her husband's murder, and the <b>crime</b> <b>is</b> attributed to Maeonius' moral degeneration and jealousy. This account, according to historian Alaric Watson, can be dismissed as fictional. Although some modern scholarship suggests that Zenobia was involved in the assassination due to political ambition and opposition to her husband's pro-Roman policy, she continued Odaenathus' policies during her first years on the throne.|$|E
5|$|In Zoha Prison in Romania, {{there are}} {{interviews}} with traffickers serving prison sentences {{that the film}} suggested were too short {{in light of the}} severity of the crime of human trafficking. The typical sentence for this <b>crime</b> <b>is</b> six or seven years, while the sentence for trafficking in drugs is normally twenty years. Two Romanian traffickers, Traian and Ovidiu, attest to having starved, punched, and kicked the girls they trafficked. Ovidiu recounts a story, in an interview filmed in February 2007, about kidnapping a prostitute and selling her for sex when he was 14. He expresses no remorse for these actions. The sentences served by Traian and Ovidiu were short enough that, by the time the film was released, they were no longer in prison. Ana, a girl they trafficked, is also interviewed in the film, saying that she lost a tooth in one of her beatings. She describes being pregnant at the time, but not telling this to her captors because of fears for the unborn child's safety.|$|E

5|$|The area {{is now one}} of {{the most}} ethnically and {{economically}} diverse in Louisville. <b>Crime</b> <b>is</b> becoming less of a problem. While in 2003 there were 11.5 crimes per 1,000 residents, over twice the average for the city of Louisville as a whole, which was 5.0 crimes per 1,000 residents Old Louisville now has a similar number of calls for police assistance as other parts of Louisville. The Louisville Metro Police 4th Division is responsible for a large portion of Louisville beyond Old Louisville, but is conveniently located in Central Park in Old Louisville. It had 134 officers assigned to it in 2006. Most calls are related to car break-ins and non-violent crimes. Murders are still rare, with one or two per year. Overall crime rates for both Old Louisville and the city as a whole increased sharply in 2005 over the 2004 rate, although there was a decline again the first half of 2006.|$|E
5|$|Adopted {{from the}} Grand Theft Auto series, Red Dead Redemption has a {{modified}} wanted system. When the player commits a crime such as killing people near witnesses, some will {{run to the}} nearest police station. The player can bribe them or kill them {{before they reach the}} station. If a <b>crime</b> <b>is</b> committed near a police officer, the wanted meter immediately appears along with a bounty count which increases with each crime committed. If Marston's bounty becomes high enough he will be pursued by either the U.S. Marshals or by the Mexican Army depending on his locations. To evade law enforcement in pursuit, John Marston must escape a circular zone until the wanted meter disappears. Alternatively, the player character can kill all lawmen in a town to have the wanted meter disappear. Despite the chase being aborted, a bounty is placed upon John which will cause bounty hunters to come after him in the wilderness. It is impossible to surrender to these bounty hunters by putting away Marston's weapon and standing still as they will kill him regardless. Only law enforcement in towns and a posse will accept surrenders. The law will continue to chase Marston unless he pays his bounty at a telegraph station or presents a pardon letter. When arrested, Marston pays off his bounty and is then released. If the player does not have enough money to pay back the bounty, the law will assign bounty hunting activities.|$|E
5|$|The National Police Directorate, {{located in}} Downtown Oslo, {{is the central}} {{administration}} for the Norwegian Police Service. It conducts management and supervision of the specialist agencies and police districts, including organizational development and support activities. The directorate {{is led by the}} National Police Commissioner, who, since 2012, has been Odd Reidar HumlegÃ¥rd. The National Criminal Investigation Service is a national unit which works with organized and serious crime. It both works as an assistant unit for police districts, with special focus on technical and tactical investigation, in addition to being responsible on its own for organized crime. It acts as the center for international police cooperation, including participation in Interpol and Europol. The National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental <b>Crime</b> <b>is</b> responsible for complex cases of economic crime and acts as a public prosecutor for those cases. The National Police Immigration Service registers and identifies asylum seekers and returns those which have their applications rejected. The National Mobile Police Service is based in Stavern and operates throughout the country. Their primary role is as highway patrol and manages the police reserves, although they also assist police districts in extraordinary events where extra manpower is needed or where they are in the vicinity.|$|E

40|$|A trivariate Weibull {{survival}} model using {{competing risks}} concept is applied on studying recidivism of committing 3 types of crimes - sex, violent and others.

We found that the correlation of time to recidivism between sex crimes and violent <b>crimes</b> <b>are</b> more correlated than other pairs.

5|$|The game {{emphasizes}} Batman's detective skills; for example, he can scan a {{crime scene}} with Detective Vision (displayed in first-person perspective) to highlight points of interest; holograms act out theoretical scenarios of the crime. The crimes can be reviewed via Batman's link to the Batcomputer in the Batcave; this allows a player to view virtual recreations of the scene from different angles (with {{the ability to move}} back and forth through the crime's timeline), view it in slow motion or pause while looking for clues to solve the crime. Small (and large) crime scenes are distributed throughout Gotham City. Reviewing the downing of a helicopter, Batman is presented with false and accurate clues; investigation of the scene can reveal that the helicopter was shot, allowing Batman to trace the bullet's trajectory to a murdered police officer and another crime scene. When a <b>crime</b> <b>is</b> solved, the player is shown a Batman-narrated rundown of the crime. The Batcave is also a hub where Batman can change costumes, upgrade his equipment and access challenge maps to practice combat (these maps were accessed separately in previous games). After completing the story mode a New Game Plus mode is unlocked, enabling a player to replay the game with all their acquired gadgets, experience and abilities; enemies are tougher, and the icon warning players of attack is disabled. Completing New Game Plus unlocks I Am the Night mode, where the game ends if Batman dies.|$|E
