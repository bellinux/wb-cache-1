50|$|By April, {{the rules}} were changed. At Bristol, the blue/orange {{procedure}} was used only for cautions - blue sticker <b>cars</b> pitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first lap under caution, orange sticker <b>cars</b> pitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second lap. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> restarts, blue sticker <b>cars</b> started <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inside and orange sticker <b>cars</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outside. Lapped <b>cars</b> went to the rear. The blue/orange rule was eliminated during green flag stops. By the next week at North Wilkesboro, the blue/orange rule was scrapped. In its place, lead lap cars only were allowed to pit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first caution, while lapped <b>cars</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second lap.|$|R

5|$|A week-long {{visit to}} White House Farm had been {{arranged}} for the August at the Bambers' request; the plan was that the boys would visit their grandparents with Sheila before going on holiday to Norway with their father. Daniel and Nicholas were reluctant {{to stay at the}} farm. They disliked that June made them pray, and in the <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way asked their father to speak to her about it. In addition Daniel had become a vegetarian and was worried about being forced to eat meat. When their father dropped them off at the house on 4 August, {{it was the last time}} he saw them. The boys are buried together in Highgate Cemetery. Sheila was cremated, and the casket with her ashes was placed in their coffin.|$|E
5|$|After killing Yeates, Tabak {{attempted}} to cast suspicion {{for the murder}} onto Jefferies after watching a news broadcast about the case while spending the New Year with relatives in the Netherlands.

They met at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport on 31 December, where Tabak elaborated on his story, but Thomas grew suspicious of his interest in the forensic work being carried out by the police and because what he said did not concur with a previous statement.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} video surfaced {{online in}} late May 2010, explaining why Beyoncé's character was remembering her love {{interest in the}} original version. It begins {{with a view of}} the night sky and many trees, as Beyoncé drives a car and Ealy's character is chased by the police through a forest. As the video progresses, she parks her <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of the road and scenes from the original version are shown. Police dogs eventually catch Ealy's character and attack him savagely. An open bag reveals stolen money, which is dispersed by the wind. At the end of the video, in the forest, Beyoncé finds Ealy lying lifelessly on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Around 2:45 a.m., Kelly was {{on patrol}} and stopped to {{investigate}} a broken-down <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of the road, which was idling with its hood up. Kelly recognized the vehicle as having been reported stolen. While sitting in his patrol car and writing a report, Kelly noticed Clemmons approaching him and recognized him as the suspect in the Lakewood shooting. Kelly ordered him to stop and show his hands, but he instead began to flee around the disabled vehicle. Police claim that Clemmons reached into his waist area for a gun. Kelly fired several rounds at Clemmons and hit him at least twice, killing him. Clemmons was carrying a handgun {{that had belonged to}} Lakewood Officer Greg Richards. Kelly was placed on routine administrative leave following the shooting. Police later said Clemmons would have eventually died from the gunshot wound he sustained at the Lakewood shooting.|$|E
5|$|E. When Jos Verstappen stalled his <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grid, Race Director Charlie Whiting {{attempted}} to abort the start, {{a procedure that}} is carried out when a car is stalled before the lights go out. However, {{the lights went out}} before he had the chance to do so, and as a result the lights afterwards displayed the standard 5 red lights and 3 amber lights. The race was immediately stopped, but the red flag was not displayed until the cars came to the start/finish line. As is the case when a start is aborted, the race was shortened by one lap as the cars were not refuelled, but Verstappen was allowed to regain his original grid position in 15th.|$|E

5|$|Exactly {{one year}} after the {{explosion}} of Flight 180, college student Kimberly Corman is heading to Daytona Beach, Florida for spring break with her friends, Shaina McKlank, Dano Estevez, and Frankie Whitman. On route, Kimberly has a premonition of logs falling off a semi, causing a massive car accident that kills everyone involved. She stalls her <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> entrance ramp, preventing several people from entering the highway, including lottery winner Evan Lewis; widow Nora Carpenter and her fifteen-year-old son Tim; businesswoman Kat Jennings; stoner Rory Peters; pregnant Isabella Hudson; high school teacher Eugene Dix; and Deputy Marshal Thomas Burke. While Thomas questions Kimberly, the pileup occurs. Shaina, Dano and Frankie are killed by a speeding truck, but Kimberly is saved by Thomas.|$|E
5|$|Further {{down the}} field, {{there was an}} intense battle between Audi and Toyota for {{positions}} three to six. Audi struggled to find an optimum set-up for their cars as they secured fourth and sixth positions. They were separated by the two Toyota vehicles in third and fifth places. André Lotterer was slowed by another <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> start of his first timed lap and was affected by oversteer on his second lap of the circuit. Marcel Fässler took over the No. 7 Audi entry from Lotterer and abandoned his first attempt because his vehicle's rear-end became excessively light and later lost downforce behind two cars in Blanchimont corner which restricted the car to starting sixth. The two Rebellion Racing cars and the No. 4 ByKolles Racing CLM P1/01 rounded out the LMP1 qualifiers. Qualifying was stopped for ten minutes when the ByKolles car collided with the No. 43 Manor entry at La Source and debris coming from the former's rear bodywork littered the track at Radallion corner.|$|E
5|$|Nelson Piquet Jr. won {{the pole}} {{position}} by recording the fastest lap in qualifying and maintained his startline advantage {{on the first}} lap. He {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field and held first place until he collided with a barrier after swerving to avoid José María López's crashed <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 17th lap allowing Sam Bird to move into the lead. Some drivers elected to make pit stops to switch to their second cars with Bird choosing to remain on the circuit until his own stop eight laps later. He had technical problems with his second car and Buemi inherited the first position. Di Grassi was no more than two seconds behind Buemi but was unable to get close enough to challenge him because he had to conserve electrical energy usage and Buemi remained the leader for the rest of the race to win. There were three lead changes among four different drivers during the course of the race.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, Rosberg {{retained}} his lead ahead of Ricciardo, followed by Vettel and Räikkönen. Sergio Pérez gained two places and was fifth, while Esteban Gutiérrez damaged his front wing when he made contact with the back of Nico Hülkenberg's car. Hamilton remained tenth until he overtook Kvyat for ninth place on lap four. One lap later, both Bottas and Hamilton seized an opportunity to overtake Max Verstappen, as he ran wide into turn two. As a reaction, Red Bull decided to change tyres on Verstappen's <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> following lap. Another lap later, Ricciardo followed suit. At Red Bull's sister team Toro Rosso, Daniil Kvyat retired on lap eight. On lap ten, Hamilton overtook Bottas for fourth place, but was more than twenty seconds behind teammate Rosberg. He went into the pit lane for a tyre change on lap 15. Force India reacted two laps later and brought Pérez in and he emerged back from the pit lane just ahead of Hamilton. Meanwhile, the order at the front was Rosberg, Vettel, Bottas, Ricciardo and Räikkönen. On lap 18, Räikkönen took fourth place by overtaking Ricciardo on the start/finish straight. Pérez moved ahead of Massa into seventh on lap 20, and Hamilton followed through one lap later, while Bottas pitted and returned to the track in ninth place.|$|E
5|$|Drainage {{problems}} with the circuit caused {{the first two days}} of the event to be cancelled. Bräck — the season points leader heading into the race — was awarded the pole position. The original distance of the race was reduced from 210 laps to 168. Bräck lost the lead on the first lap to de Ferran who held the first position for the next 44 laps. Bräck passed de Ferran to reclaim the lead on the 45th lap and remained the leader until the second round of pit stops. The race distance was further reduced by series race director Chris Kneifel from 168 to 140 laps because of a danger from fading daylight. Gil de Ferran held the first position until he was held up by a slower <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> race's penultimate lap which allowed Bräck to retake the lead. He held it until de Ferran overtook him on the final lap winning the race. It was de Ferran's first victory of the season, his second on an oval track, and the sixth of his career. There were three cautions and five lead changes {{during the course of the}} race.|$|E
5|$|Duval and Abt {{made the}} best starts in the field, gaining two {{positions}} {{by the end of}} the first lap while Piquet lost three positions over the same distance. At the end of the first lap, Turvey led from López, who in turn, was followed by Heidfeld, Vergne, Bird, Félix da Costa, Rosenqvist, Buemi, Carroll, Evans, Gutiérrez, Engel, Prost, di Grassi, Frijns, Abt, d'Ambrosio, Duval, Piquet and Sarrazin. The stewards deployed the safety <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second lap to allow marshals to clear debris in the chicane. Prost made a pit stop for a nose cone replacement while Sarrazin elected to switch into his second car. Di Grassi rejoined the race on the same lap as the leading drivers but was now at the back of the field. Turvey led the field back up to speed at the lap-five restart, closely followed by López. Buemi immediately attacked Rosenqvist and passed him for sixth place and started to draw closer to Bird. López began to pressure Turvey for the lead with Heidfeld and Vergne close in arrears. Jaguar teammates Evans and Carroll began battling for eighth while Gutiérrez lost tenth to both Andretti cars of Félix da Costa and Frijns with Abt gaining further positions to run in 12th. At the entry to turn 13, Turvey had power issues with his car, and slowed on the start/finish straight, handing the lead to López. Turvey stopped at the turn one exit.|$|E

5|$|Homer, {{who still}} wants to party, rents an airboat and forces his family to come with him. He races through a swamp, accidentally killing the state's most famous {{resident}} and reptile – an alligator named Captain Jack, whom Marge, Maggie, Lisa, and Bart saw on a tour earlier while Homer made a fool of himself at the concert. A sheriff quickly arrives {{on the scene and}} despite the fact that Homer is the sole guilty culprit, the entire family is charged for killing the alligator. The family members flee from the sheriff and during a car chase they are hit by a train that pushes their <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rail for several miles. When the Simpsons get off of the rail, they escape to a restaurant where they are given employment. They live in a nearby trailer and progressively turn into hillbillies. The sheriff eventually tracks them down and kidnaps them while they are sleeping. For their crimes (and Homer's foolish attempt at defending himself in court), the family is put into forced labor. One night when they are working at a party held by a judge in front of the capitol, tending to the guests (and failing to escape), Captain Jack strolls out of the capitol's doors. It turns out that he was never dead but rather knocked out. The family is acquitted, though they are banned from entering the state of Florida again (and several other states, excluding Arizona and North Dakota).|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Hamilton set the fastest lap {{of the day}} at one minute and 35.078 seconds; Rosberg was second, and Bottas third. Button was fourth-fastest, ahead of Vettel and Räikkönen. Alonso, Magnussen, Kvyat and Ricciardo followed in the top ten. Some cars went off the track; Ricciardo disrupted the session for eight minutes when an oversteer sent him into the turn-18 barrier. Kobayashi {{lost control of the}} rear end of his Caterham at turn three, damaging his rear suspension and front wing, and Vergne stopped his <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back straight after exiting the Spoon Curve with a fuel pump problem. Esteban Gutiérrez later lost control of his Sauber entering the Spoon Curve and crashed into the tyre barrier. Vergne stopped a second time with an electrical problem after exiting turn 14, which brought out a second red flag; the session ended early, due to limited time available. Rosberg recorded the fastest lap time of the third practice session at one minute and 33.228 seconds, ahead of Hamilton and Alonso. Massa was fourth-fastest; Bottas was fifth and Ricciardo sixth. Magnussen was seventh, Vergne eighth, Kvyat ninth and Button completed the top ten. Hamilton drove quickly into the first turn but ran wide onto the run-off area and collided with the tyre barrier, damaging the left front quarter of his car. Although Gutiérrez lost control of his car's rear end leaving turn 15, he avoided crashing into the wall.|$|E
5|$|On 2 February 1996, {{the tunnel}} company had an {{agreement}} with Bru og Tunnelskelskapet, which operates the Bergen Toll Ring, to collect the tolls in the tunnel using the Autopass automatic toll collection system. A manual collection system was estimated to cost NOK1.4 million per year, while an automated system was estimated at NOK0.4 million. The tunnel opened on 7 May 1996, {{the same day the}} last ferry ran. Originally the plan was to charge tolls similar to the ferry. With a manual system, it would not be possible to charge for two-wheeled vehicles and passengers, so the fares for other vehicles were raised slightly. In 1995, it had cost NOK44 for a single passing with a <b>car</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ferry. The tolls were set to NOK120 for all types of vehicles, except two-wheelers, and NOK72 was charged per travel with pre-paid ticket books. Bus riders had to pay for two extra zones. The toll plaza was open a few hour each week to allow people to purchase discounted tickets.|$|E
