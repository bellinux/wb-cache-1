40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the life of}} William Jellie (1865 - 1963) {{and in so doing}} uses it as a prism with which to gain a view of history. It covers a period of ninety-eight years divided between the United Kingdom and New Zealand. His studies for the Unitarian ministry at Manchester College, removed from London to Oxford in his final year, gave him a unique education in late Victorian Britain. A course in sociology, economics and social problems which helped shape his world view. Taught by Philip Wicksteed, a Unitarian minister, economist and Dante scholar, Wicksteed would pass his passion for Dante on to William Jellie and become his friend and mentor for life. Wicksteed’s course dealt with inequality and human suffering and in doing so made it plain that a Unitarian minister was expected to address these issues and not ignore them. Consistent with his views as an ethical socialist, Philip Wicksteed supported a former class mate of William Jellie’s, John Trevor, to found the Labour Church movement in Britain in response to the prevailing conditions. William Jellie worked in his first parish for six years in one of the poorest parts of London, experiencing firsthand the suffering and depredation of an unreformed capitalism. The relationship between a theology on the left of the spectrum and the accommodation of the political left becomes an important consideration in this thesis. Arriving in New Zealand in 1900 to organise the Unitarian cause, William Jellie enjoyed friendships with Sir Robert Stout and Sir George Fowlds. He brought a cultured and intellectual view of liberal religion to colonial life. He founded a church in Auckland and was instrumental in expanding the cause to other centres. Having married in New Zealand, he returned to England just before the outbreak of war in 1914, remaining for the next seven years. There his feelings for his country of birth, Ireland, led him to publicly support the call for independence, a <b>call</b> <b>not</b> <b>accepted</b> by many of his congregants. The return of peace saw the return of the Jellie family to New Zealand. Now his ministerial work was much more subscribed and William Jellie turned to a new occupation, tutor for the Worker’s Educational Association in Auckland. This in many ways proved to be his forte, he was extremely popular as a teacher and while he concentrated on English literature and Dante courses, he also included political theory. Throughout his life in New Zealand William Jellie undertook a strong defence of secular education and in so doing was aligned with the rationalist movement on this issue...|$|E

In the case that the new <b>call</b> does <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> any degradation, the attempt to degrade lesser or equal priority users who are already in the system is still made, and the new call is again accepted only if it leads to higher revenue.|$|R

Two university students living in a nearby building saw Safronov on the ground with the window open above, and called emergency workers. Safronov was alive immediately after the fall, but at least a half-hour passed before help arrived. Safronov was lying on his stomach, and it seemed to the students that he had tried to get up on his feet. Noticing the open window on the stairway between the fourth and fifth floors {{and the fact that the}} Safronov's shoes had come off and his jacket and sweater were pulled up to his armpits, the students called for an ambulance. Their <b>call</b> was <b>not</b> <b>accepted,</b> however. [...] "We cannot collect all the drunks in Moscow on Friday night," [...] the first responders told psychology student Lena, who had witnessed the fall. She should call back if he was still there in half an hour, Kommersant reported on 6 March 2007.http://www.kommersant.com/p747802/Ivan_Safronov_arms_trading/ During that time Safronov stopped moving altogether. The students told the daily that they did not see anyone near Safronov, nor anyone in the windows of the stairway or leaving through the front door. At least three of his neighbors on the fourth and fifth floors were home at the time. They did not hear any suspicious noises on the stairway.|$|R
40|$|This paper evaluates call {{blocking}} probability over packet-switched networks with Time-driven priority (TDP) (Li et al. 1998; Li, Ofek and Yung 1996). The presented work is novel since {{call blocking}} is typically {{studied in the}} context of circuit-switched networks. TDP together with resource reservation enables real-time delivery of packets with no loss due to congestion and constant jitter of one time frame (TF) typically between 12. 5 s and 125 s. Resource reservation for a call (or multiple calls) over a TDP network requires finding a schedule. A <b>call</b> may <b>not</b> be <b>accepted</b> for two reasons (i) there is no capacitythe call is rejectedor (ii) there is capacity but no schedulethe call is blocked. This work studies the call blocking probability {{as a function of the}} link utilization, since call blocking can possibly lead to low link utilization. In other words, it may not be possible to fully utilize the network because of unschedulability (i. e., the inability to find a schedule). The results [...] ...|$|R
