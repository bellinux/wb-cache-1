The first corner complex was tightened on entry, {{while the}} middle {{part of the}} track was completely re-profiled, retaining much of the original design whilst reducing the reliance on aerodynamic grip. The most significant changes {{were made in the}} final part, with the Peraltada <b>corner</b> <b>cut</b> in half and the circuit redirected through the Foro Sol stadium complex in the circuit infield beginning with turn 12, following a similar layout to the one used by Champ Car between 2002 and 2007. The track layout featured two drag reduction system (DRS) zones, one on the main straight and another between turns three and four.|$|E

The Casa Chata is on the corner of Hidalgo and Matamoros Streets. It was built in the 18th century, with one <b>corner</b> <b>cut</b> off, creating a small façade around the main entrance. The name refers to this feature as “chata” mean flattened, or pushed in. As Tlalpan was the capital of the State of Mexico for six years, a number of constructions related to this function, such as the Casa de Moneda (coin mint) and a government print shop were built and still remain. In the latter, Cuban writer José María Heredia published poems about his stay in Mexico.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{solution}} quality for min-cut problems on graphs when restricting {{the shapes of}} the allowed cuts. In particular we are interested in min-cut problems with additional size constraints on the parts being cut out from the graph. Such problems include the bisection problem, separator problem, or the sparsest cut problem. We therefore aim at cutting out a given number m of vertices from a graph using as few edges as possible. We consider this problem on solid grid graphs, which are finite, connected subgraphs of the infinite two-dimensional grid that do not have holes. Our interest is in the tradeoff between the simplicity of the cut shapes and their solution quality: we study <b>corner</b> <b>cuts</b> in which each cut has at most one right-angled bend. We prove that optimum <b>corner</b> <b>cuts</b> get us arbitrarily close to a cut-out part of size m, and that this limitation makes us lose only a constant factor in the quality of the solution. We obtain our result by a thorough study of cuts in polygons and the effect of limiting these to <b>corner</b> <b>cuts...</b>|$|R

It was named after Pieter Albert Vincent van Harinxma thoe Slooten in 1950 who was King's Commissioner to Friesland from 1909 to 1945. Prior to this date it was called Harlinger Trekvaart.

50|$|The settee sail was a {{lateen sail}} {{with the front}} <b>corner</b> <b>cut</b> off, giving it a {{quadrilateral}} shape.

It lasted well into the 20th century as a common sail on Arab dhows. The settee sail requires a shorter yard than does the lateen, and both settee and lateen have shorter masts than square-rigged sails.|$|E

50|$|The {{colour palette}} of the zellige increased, making it {{possible}} to multiply the compositions ad infinitum (see picture above). The most current form of the zellige is a square. Other forms are possible: the octagon combined with a cabochon, a star, a cross, etc. It is then moulded with a thickness of approximately 2 centimetres. There are simple squares of 10 by 10 centimeters or with the <b>corners</b> <b>cut</b> to be combined with a coloured cabochon. To pave the grounds, bejmat, a paving stone of 15 by 5 centimetres approximately and 2 centimetres thick, can also be used.|$|R
