5|$|Italian {{prosecutors}} brought {{legal proceedings}} against six people {{in connection with}} Senna's death. They were Frank Williams, Patrick Head and Adrian Newey of Williams; Fedrico Bendinelli representing {{the owners of the}} Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari; Giorgio Poggi as the circuit director and Roland Bruynseraede who was race director and sanctioned the circuit. The trial verdict was given on 16 December 1997, clearing all six defendants of manslaughter charges. The cause of Senna's accident was established by the court as the steering column breaking. The column had been cut and welded back together at Senna's request in order for him to be more <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car.|$|E
5|$|Shearer {{is married}} to Lainya, whom he met whilst a Southampton player. The couple lived locally with her parents during Shearer's second year at the south coast club, and were married on 8 June 1991 at St. James' Church in the city. In {{contrast}} to the portrayal of some WAGs (wives and girlfriends) of later players by the media, Lainya is described by Shearer as a quiet and reserved person, not <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spotlight her husband's fame sometimes brought. The couple have three children. Shearer cited not wanting to uproot his family as a key reason for remaining in England during his career, having {{had the chance to}} move to Juventus or Barcelona when leaving Blackburn. Shearer's family accompanied him onto the pitch following the striker's testimonial in May 2006 as he performed a lap of honour at St James' Park.|$|E

5|$|To {{record the}} album, Jackson {{suggested}} a small studio located outside of Washington, D.C. in Silver Spring, Maryland. The sessions {{took place in}} September and October 1973 at Silver Spring's D Sound Studios. According to Scott-Heron, the studio's main room was so small that when the two musicians recorded, Jackson was forced out next to the cooler, playing flute in the studio's hallway while Scott-Heron sang in the main room. However, Scott-Heron felt <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> small studio. Jose Williams was enlisted as the recording engineer for the album. Williams assisted Scott-Heron and Jackson, who were credited for production under the title Perpis-Fall Music, Inc., with production, and he engineered the album's recordings entirely himself.|$|E
5|$|Hutton captained the England Test team between 1952 and 1955, {{although}} his leadership was at times controversial. He pursued a cautious approach and faced criticism for negativity. Never <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> role, Hutton {{felt that the}} former amateur players who administered and governed English cricket did not trust him. In 23 Tests as captain, he won eight Tests and lost four with the others drawn. Worn out by the mental and physical demands of his role, Hutton retired from regular first-class cricket during the 1955 season. Knighted for his contributions to cricket in 1956, {{he went on to}} be a Test selector, a journalist and broadcaster. He also worked as a representative for an engineering firm until retiring from the job in 1984. Hutton remained involved in cricket, and became president of Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1990. He died a few months afterwards in September 1990, aged 74.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} England's opening pair {{did not result}} in an {{improvement}} on the scoreboard. A run out was narrowly avoided following a mix-up on the first ball, and Cyril Washbrook and Emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface that offered early assistance to the bowlers. The Australians themselves started with Ray Lindwall and Bill Johnston taking the new ball, but Bradman had misjudged the breeze and had to swap his bowlers' ends. For this purpose, Loxton bowled a solitary over. He was erratic in his length and bowled three long hops outside leg stump at the debutant Emmett, who ignored the opportunity to attack and let the balls pass. At the other end, Washbrook also played watchfully and avoided any horizontal bat shots, apart from a missed cut against Johnston's bowling. Overall however, the English openers appeared <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first half hour of play.|$|E

25|$|Elbe started {{dressing}} in women's clothes after {{filling in for}} Gottlieb's absentee model; {{she was asked to}} wear stockings and heels so her legs could substitute for those of the model.

Over time, Gottlieb became famous for her paintings of beautiful women with haunting, almond-shaped eyes dressed in chic fashions. In 1913, the unsuspecting public was shocked to discover that the model who had inspired Gottlieb's depictions of petites femmes fatales was in fact Elbe.|$|E
25|$|As {{technology}} {{continues to}} advance, {{more can be}} added onto the controller to give the player a more immersive experience when playing different games. There are some controllers that have presets so that the buttons are mapped a certain way to make playing certain games easier. Along with the presets, a player can sometimes custom map the buttons to better accommodate their play style. On keyboard and mouse, different actions in the game are already preset to keys on the keyboard. Most games allow the player to change that so that the actions are mapped to different keys that are more to their liking.

25|$|Aware of the {{possible}} implications, Rosenqvist pulled away to build a steady advantage over Buemi. Evans's team forgot to change the gear in his second car, delaying his exit from his garage as he required additional time to get his vehicle into first gear. This caused Evans to emerge {{at the back of}} the field in 18th position. As the field became <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second period of the event, di Grassi began to challenge Vergne for third position. Following aggressive defensive manoeuvres which drew a verbal warning from his team, Vergne narrowly avoided hitting di Grassi at the final turn. Vergne was forced off the racing line under braking by di Grassi who overtook him for third heading into the first corner on lap 32. Abt activated FanBoost in an attempt to move ahead of Vergne on the next lap but was unable to pass him. Contact prevented Abt from overtaking Vergne, but after a short period of time, passed him for fourth place. Duval stopped on the circuit but later managed to limp his ailing car into the pit lane, prematurely ending his race. Having reviewed Rosenqvist's pit stop release, the stewards issued him with a ten-second time penalty on lap 34.|$|E
