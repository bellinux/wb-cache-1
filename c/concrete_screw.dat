40|$|This report aims {{to outline}} {{a number of}} {{attachment}} methods for the geophones used in vibration measurements. On behalf of Bjerking AB and their department for environmental control and vibration, a new attachment method has been developed that works on today’s building designs. Suggested mounting methods include some methods with their main stronghold in the foundation’s outermost layer and some with mounting in the concrete inside the foam. The best method is to drill through the foam and with a <b>concrete</b> <b>screw</b> - suitable for concrete drilling without plug - and anchor the geophone in the concrete. Due to the difficulty {{to get a hold}} of these screws with the required length and diameter for the current case, a similar approach with available material has been developed. This method includes a hammer drill, a threaded rod, an expander and two nuts. The conclusion drawn is that the attachment of the concrete is preferable and that this can be achieved with relatively simple means. Other methods require extensive knowledge of the building’s design as well as advanced and time-consuming tools...|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{strengthening}} reinforced concrete members using mechanically-fastened FRP (MF-FRP) {{has been studied}} in laboratory investigations and in several bridge strengthening demonstration projects. The strengthening is obtained by attaching FRP strips, with high bearing and longitudinal strengths, to concrete elements using steel power actuated fastening "pins" (PAFs), steel anchor bolts or <b>concrete</b> <b>screws,</b> or a combination thereof.

40|$|Proposition of {{this work}} is the {{investigation}} of the structural behavior of a newly developed timber construction system. It is a modular prefabricated system which combines a typical Platform Frame system with an external small thickness concrete slabs having the function of diaphragm against the horizontal actions and also thermal ad acoustic functions. Walls are formed by in situ connection of the single modules preassembled in the factory, with considerable advantages {{from the point of view}} of the site management. The structural design is similar to that of the Platform Frame, where the bracing stiffness and strength assured by nailing the OSB panels to the wooden structure cumulates with that given by the <b>concrete</b> slabs <b>screwed</b> to the vertical structure with large diameter connectors. The use of large diameter connectors assure to the investigated system a considerable stiffness and in the meantime a great capacity of energy dissipation in case of seismic events. In order to verify the real performance of the construction system under seismic actions several monotonic and cyclic tests on single panel modules and on an assembled walls was carried out. Such tests were carried out in accordance with the testing protocols specified in EN 12512. Various configurations of connection to the footing beam and between timber and concrete slab were tested. In this work the results of the experimental tests are reported and the good seismic performance of the structural system has been proved. The analytical expressions that best fit the experimental monotonic load displacement curve are reported and the comparison of the measured results with that calculated according with the national and international codes are given...|$|R
40|$|The use of mechanically-fastened fibre-reinforced polymer (MF-FRP) strips {{has been}} {{recently}} proposed {{as a possible}} alternative solution to the most common externally-bonded (EB) sheets and laminates. Although several applications of MF-FRP strengthening on reinforced concrete (RC) structures are already available, further experimental and theoretical studies are needed for both achieving a thorough knowledge of their mechanical behaviour and formulating sound design rules. The present paper deals with identifying {{the relationships between the}} actual bearing stress transferred by the fastener and the corresponding relative displacement (slip) at the FRP–concrete interface. For this purpose, a simplified numerical model is firstly formulated to simulate the experimental behaviour observed from direct shear tests (DSTs) recently performed by the Authors on FRP laminates fastened to <b>concrete</b> blocks with <b>screwed</b> steel anchors. Then, the numerical model is employed within an optimisation procedure aimed at indirectly identifying the relationships between the force applied on the single fastener and the corresponding displacement. Finally, the results of this inverse identification procedure are compared for pointing out the differences possibly arising in terms of interface stress–slip relationship as a result of different detailing in the fastening system. In particular, the cases of fasteners with or without steel washers are investigated...|$|R
40|$|A new {{technique}} for strengthening reinforced concrete (RC) slabs using FRP composites is investigated. It {{is referred to}} as the mechanically fastened (MF) technique, which is based on fixing FRP materials to concrete using closely spaced powder-actuated fasteners. A special FRP material, known by the trade name SAFSTRIP ª, is used in this method. It is characterized by a high bearing strength as well as a high tensile strength. This {{new technique}} is very rapid compared to the conventional bonded FRP techniques. Furthermore, it allows for immediate use of the structure after completion of the installation process. In addition, unlike the bonded system, the use of the MF system results in a desirable ductile behaviour of the strengthened structure. The commonly used fasteners in this technique are embedded into the concrete using a powder actuated fastening"gun". The shot of this fastener is very strong and may sometimes cause initial cracking or concrete spalling or may locally damage the FRP if the fastener is overdriven. To overcome these problems we have proposed a new fastener based on screwing rather than shooting the fastener into the <b>concrete.</b> This <b>screwed</b> fastener has a better anchorage into the concrete, and displays a much better performance. This study attempts to investigate the behaviour of RC slabs strengthened in flexure with the mechanically fastened FRP system. Two series of large-scale reinforced concrete slabs are tested. The first series is comprised of five slabs without a cut-out, and measuring 2600 x 2600 x 120 mm; the second series consists of four slabs of the same dimensions with a central cut-out measuring 800 x 800 mm. In each series, one slab is left unstrengthened to serve as a reference while FRP strips are used to strengthen the remaining slabs. Different strengthening patterns are used with different spacings between fasteners. Also, the conventionally bonded strengthening technique is used for the sake of comparison. The mechanically fastened system is found to be an interesting alternative to the bonded system resulting in a rapid, economic, and effective system. The gained increases in ultimate capacities of the MF FRP-strengthened slabs range between 30 to 70 % over those of the unstrengthened specimens. Moreover, the use of the MF system shows a desirable pseudo-ductile mode of failure. As a complementary study, experimental results from 27 direct shear tests on FRP strips mechanically fastened to concrete blocks are reported. Based on the results from these tests, new analytical models that describe the interfacial behaviour between the MF FRP and concrete substrate are developed. These models are referred to as"bearing-slip" models. Finite element models are then introduced to address the interfacial behaviour between the FRP strips and the concrete substrate for the MF FRP/concrete direct shear specimens. Results are presented in terms of ultimate load capacities and load-slip relationships. The numerical predictions are verified against the experimental data, and very good agreement is obtained. Based on this verification, the proposed bearing-slip models are subsequently used in finite element analyses to simulate the cases of RC beams and slabs strengthened with the MF system. Also, the theoretical part of this study is extended to include finite element modelling of bonded FRP-strengthened slabs. The interfacial behaviour between the FRPs and the concrete substrate is accounted for by using appropriate interfacial models. It is shown that the numerical models can be applied to arbitrary FRP configurations, and can also accommodate both passive as well as prestressed FRP strengthening schemes. Results are presented in terms of load-deflection relationships, ultimate load capacities, failure modes, and interfacial slip and stress distributions. When compared to test results reported in the literature, the analysis is shown to lead to very good predictions...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the seismic behavior, ductility and dissipative capacity of modern timber buildings. A number of innovations {{in the field of}} timber structures are reported with special regard to the modeling techniques suitable for timber joints and to the characterization of the seismic behavior of modern timber systems. A preliminary overview on the seismic-resistant timber building technology and on their evolution from the past to nowadays is reported in the introduction of this thesis work. A review of the state of art about the available seismic codes is also reported and the main lack and incongruence with the current constructive practice are pointed out. The basic terms and concepts used in structural modeling and nonlinear analysis of timber structure are provided {{in the first part of}} this dissertation. The specific behavior of wood joints under cyclic actions and therefore under earthquakes is described with emphasis to the pinching effect and strength and stiffness degrading. A literature review on the main numerical models proposed to reproduce the hysteretic load-slip curve of single fasteners, joints and whole wooden elements is presented and discussed. A proposal for a new wood joint numerical model that can be easily implemented into a standard commercial Finite Element code is reported. The reliability of such new developed model to reproduce the fasteners hysteresis behavior is presented and critically discussed in comparison with experimental results. The second part of this thesis work is based on the evidence that the growing spread of the use of timber structures has led to the development of numerous innovative construction systems but at the same time a lack of code provisions for seismic timber structure still remains, in particular concerning the ductility (or behavior) factor q to be used for the design of different timber systems. This part of dissertation analyzes the definitions of the q-factor given in the scientific literature and its relevance in the design of seismic resistant structures. The traditional methods for estimating the q-factor are investigated and an innovative procedure for expeditious q-factor estimation is presented. The theoretical aspects of this new analytical-experimental procedure are reported and the main advantages and limitations are critically discussed. The seismic behavior of the Cross Laminated Timber structure is in deep studied in the third part of this dissertation. Such building system is largely spreading in the constructive practice but no design guidelines are provided in the seismic codes yet, especially for what concerning the definition of their sound behavior factor. Aim of this part of dissertation is to define the influence of some significant building characteristics, such as building technology, storeys number, slenderness, design criteria etc [...] , on the q-factor value. Such influences were studied referring to a numbers of building configuration and by means of nonlinear analyses carried out using specific hysteretic spring lamp-mass models. Based on such numerical assessment a proposal for an analytical formulation suitable to calculate the q-factor of CrossLam buildings has been developed and is presented. The validation and the applicability limits of the proposed formulation are presented and critically discussed. The final part of the dissertation investigates from the structural efficacy of newly developed construction technology which uses an external concrete shelter made of precast R. C. slabs to improve the performance of standard platform-frame shear walls. The idea consists of external plating made of thin reinforced <b>concrete</b> slabs <b>screwed</b> to the wooden frame of the walls. The concrete slab acts as a diaphragm against the horizontal forces. The structural response of this shearwalls under monotonic and cyclic loading conditions has been assessed by means of experimental tests. The tests outcomes are presented and compared with those from code provisions. Fulfillment of the requirements given by current codes as regards the attribution to the Higher Ductility Class is also verified. The influence of concrete skin on the seismic response of the shearwalls is also evaluated by means of numerical analysis and the assured “q” ductility factor is estimated. ...|$|R
40|$|Timber-concrete {{composite}} {{beams and}} slabs require interlayer connection, which provides composite {{action for the}} cross-section. A range of mechanical connectors {{is available on the}} market with an extensive variety of stiffness and strength properties, which are fundamental design parameters for the composite structure. Stiff and strong connection systems are highly desirable in order to achieve high composite action. At the same time, however, the connectors should be inexpensive, so as to make the composite beam an economically viable alternative to the traditional precast concrete and steel-concrete composite floor systems. This paper reports the outcomes of an experimental programme carried out on timber-concrete composite systems with prefabricated concrete slabs. The programme included shear tests to failure of different connection systems and 4 -point bending tests to failure of five 4. 8 m long timber-concrete composite beam specimens. Based on the outcomes of the shear tests, two different connector types were selected for the full-scale beam tests: (i) steel tubes inserted into the <b>concrete</b> slab and <b>screwed</b> to the glulam beam, and (ii) single folded steel plates nailed to both sides of the glulam beam and welded onto a long punched metal plate embedded into the concrete slab. The new systems based on mechanical "dry-dry" connectors embedded into a pre-cast concrete slab have the advantage of not requiring pouring and curing of concrete on site. This will result in a significant improvement in the entire construction process by achieving higher quality while saving resources and simplifying recycling of waste. The beam specimens were ramp loaded to failure to assess the structural performance at ultimate and serviceability limit state. Mid-span deflection, applied load, and slip distribution along the beam length were monitored during the tests. The efficiencies of the new proposed connection systems, calculated by comparing the experimental results with the analytical limits of full and no composite action, were found {{to be in the same}} range as for connections with cast-in-situ concrete slabs. Some improvements such as a larger number of nails or larger diameter nails or screws are possible for the connection with metal plates nailed to the glulam beam in order to increase the composite action achievable by the system. The experimental load-displacement curves and slip distribution along the beam length were compared with the outcomes of a numerical analysis performed using a uniaxial finite element model purposely developed for timber-concrete composite beams. The actual shear force-relative slip measured in the shear tests were implemented in the software. Very good agreement was found, enabling the use of the program for parametric studies aimed to extend the experimental results to composite beams with different geometrical and mechanical properties. The use of the analytical formulae suggested by Ceccotti in accordance with the Eurocode 5 was found to provide acceptable accuracy for the design of the composite structure. In conclusion, the new developed composite systems based on the use of concrete slab prefabricated off-site and connected on site with timber beam can represent a viable alternative to the traditional composite systems with cast-in-situ concrete topping, with similar efficiencies achievable but all the advantages of the prefabrication.
