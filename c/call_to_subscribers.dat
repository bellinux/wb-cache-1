50|$|The {{technology}} {{behind the}} Witel service {{is based on}} phones that route calls over WiFi networks as opposed to traditional GSM or CDMA networks. By doing so Witel is using an existing global communications platform <b>to</b> deliver <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> its <b>subscribers</b> {{as long as they}} are within the vicinity of a WiFi network.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, each {{central office}} could serve up <b>to</b> 10,000 <b>subscriber</b> numbers, {{resulting}} in a four-digit line or station number. Thus, the new numbering plan identified each telephone in the system with {{the combination of the}} area code, the central office code, and the line number, {{resulting in a}} closed telephone numbering plan with a ten-digit national telephone number for each telephone. The leading part of this address was the area code (three digits), followed by the seven-digit subscriber number consisting of three digits for the central office and four digits for the station. The intent was that subscribers should not have to dial an area code when making a local call or a call within their plan area, resulting in seven-digit dialing. Area codes were only required in ten-digit dialing when placing foreign area <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>subscribers</b> in another state or numbering plan area.|$|R
50|$|When {{telephone}} {{systems were}} first introduced, subscribers called a telephone exchange and asked a human operator <b>to</b> connect the <b>call</b> <b>to</b> another <b>subscriber</b> {{on the same}} exchange; <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> other exchanges were originally not possible. Later it became possible to dial numbers on the same exchange; <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> other exchanges (trunk calls) were possible, but had to be connected by an operator. When subscribers in one area became able <b>to</b> dial non-local <b>subscribers,</b> the term used for the innovation was subscriber trunk dialling.|$|R

25|$|Cell {{sites have}} {{relatively}} low-power (often {{only one or}} two watts) radio transmitters which broadcast their presence and relay communications between the mobile handsets and the switch. The switch in turn connects the <b>call</b> <b>to</b> another <b>subscriber</b> of the same wireless service provider or to the public telephone network, which includes the networks of other wireless carriers. Many of these sites are camouflaged to blend with existing environments, particularly in scenic areas.|$|R
50|$|Heavy rain {{warning was}} first {{introduced}} in April 1967 together with thunderstorm warning by the Royal Observatory of Hong Kong {{as a result of}} the three rainstorms in 1966 which claimed 86 lives. The heavy rain warning was issued when an hourly rainfall of more than 50 mm (2 inches before metrication) was expected in six hours. Both heavy rain and thunderstorm warnings were issued to the public through press release, radio broadcast and telephone <b>calling</b> service <b>to</b> <b>subscribers.</b> In 1983, the heavy rain warning was replaced by flood and landslip warnings.|$|R
50|$|In the London {{telephone}} area, <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>subscribers</b> {{who were}} not serviced by Director telephone systems within local call-charging range of the London Director exchange area were carried by tandem exchange Toll A: a subscriber would dial a prefix code, usually three letters, followed {{by the number of}} the other subscriber on the fringe non-director exchange. Calls from fringe non-director exchanges to numbers within the director area were passed in two ways. For those to director exchanges near the area boundary adjacent to the non-director exchange, subscribers were given codes to dial, and told to follow the code with the numerical portion of the other subscriber's number. For director exchanges remote from the area boundary, the <b>subscriber</b> was told <b>to</b> dial 7, to wait for a second dialling tone, and to follow this with the whole of the other number. These calls were handled by tandem exchange Toll B, from which the second dialling tone originated. To have a second dialling tone in this way was very unusual on the PSTN in the UK, although the French and Belgian PTTs had a similar instruction for when their customers made international calls.|$|R
50|$|The MSISDN {{together}} with IMSI are two important numbers used for identifying a mobile subscriber. The latter {{is stored in}} the SIM, i.e. the card inserted into the mobile phone, and each IMSI uniquely identifies the mobile station, its home wireless network, and the home country of the home wireless network, while the former is the number used for routing <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> the <b>subscriber.</b> IMSI is often used as a key in the HLR ("subscriber database") and MSISDN is the number normally dialed <b>to</b> connect a <b>call</b> <b>to</b> the mobile phone. A SIM has a unique IMSI that does not change, while the MSISDN can change in time, i.e. different MSISDNs {{can be associated with}} the SIM.|$|R
50|$|Another {{possibility}} to prevent using the plain text list as {{a list of}} people <b>to</b> <b>call</b> is <b>to</b> provide honeypot numbers, unique to each telemarketer. If a telemarketer, or anyone he has given the list <b>to,</b> then <b>calls</b> one of the honeypot numbers, stiff penalties {{can be applied to the}} telemarketer. If the originating number of a violating call is either foreign or disguised, the CRTC could apply the penalties to the telco which delivered the <b>call</b> <b>to</b> the <b>subscriber's</b> line since that telco acted as an agent of the telemarketer by delivering the call.. There is no indication from the CRTC as to whether honeypots have been implemented as part of the DNCL.|$|R
40|$|Firms {{in mobile}} {{telephone}} markets charge {{one another for}} delivering <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>subscribers.</b> These so-called termination charges are controversial from a policy perspective since they are fairly high and stable. We present a model of consumer and firm behavior in mobile markets {{in order to identify}} the role of termination charges in determining the market equilibrium. We analyze three segments of the mobile market: termination, calling, and subscribing. Our model predicts a “waterbed effect”, that is, high termination rates will be associated with low subscription prices, if preferences are the primary source of variation in termination rates. If costs are the main driver of termination rates our model predicts a “tide ” hypothesis in which high termination rates exist alongside high subscription prices. We test these and other predictions from our model using international data on mobile subscriptions per person. We find results which are broadly consistent with our model. More specifically, we find evidence that mobile termination rates are positive and significantly related to mobile phone adoption. This result is robust to the inclusion of a variety of other structural, institutional, demographic, and income controls. We also find that competition, internet subscriptions, and a free press are positively associated with mobile phone adoption while fixed termination rates and inequality slow the adoption of mobile technologies...|$|R
50|$|Flagfall or flag fall is {{a common}} Australian {{expression}} for a fixed start fee, especially in the taxi and haulage and railway industries. From the Australian mobile phone industry, the expression has recently begun to spread to other English language countries, as business jargon for an initial fixed fee for establishing each phone call. The logic behind {{is believed to be}} a method used by Australian mobile phone companies to recover a component of the carriage charges they incur in completing a <b>call</b> <b>to</b> a <b>subscriber</b> being the termination rates, based on the price terms and conditions for the mobile terminating access service (MTAS). The Australian Consumer and Competition Commission is reviewing these arrangements.|$|R
40|$|I derive Ramsey optimal {{prices in}} one-way access of long-distance {{operators}} and enhanced service providers to local loops. As long-distance services and enhanced services become substitutes {{due to the}} advance of Internet telephony, the Ramsey principle requires higher access charges assessed on both services. I also derive Ramsey prices in two-way interconnection between fixed-link and mobile phone networks, which {{turn out to be}} formally equivalent to those for the one-way access above. This result suggests that the price of fixed-to-mobile calls should be higher than the price of mobile-to-fixed calls when the substitutability of <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> double <b>subscribers</b> is more prominent than the substitutability of calls of double subscribers, and vice versa. ...|$|R
50|$|The usage by a {{subscriber}} in a {{visited network}} is captured in a file called the TAP (Transferred Account Procedure) for GSM / CIBER (Cellular Intercarrier Billing Exchange Record) for CDMA, AMPS etc... file and {{is transferred to}} the home network. A TAP/CIBER file contains details of the calls made by the subscriber viz. location, calling party, called party, time of call and duration, etc. The TAP/CIBER files are rated as per the tariffs charged by the visited operator. The home operator then bills these <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> its <b>subscribers</b> and may charge a mark-up/tax applicable locally.As recently many carriers launched own retail rate plans and bundles for Roaming, TAP records are generally used for wholesale Inter-Operators settlements only.|$|R

50|$|For {{landline}} subscribers, {{the area}} code, prefixed by the digit '2', {{was incorporated into}} the subscriber's number. For mobile <b>subscribers,</b> formerly seven (<b>to</b> <b>call</b> another <b>subscriber</b> using the same operator) or eleven (<b>to</b> <b>call</b> any mobile <b>subscriber)</b> digits were used. For special number ranges, formerly ten digits were used, but the initial '0' was dropped. These changes made that nine digits were used for all calls after 1999.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Phone features, e. g., 911 call, voicemail, and Do Not Disturb, are {{critical}} and necessary for all deployed VoIP systems. In this paper, we empirically investigate {{the security of}} these phone features. We have implemented a number of attacks and experimented with VoIP services by leading VoIP service providers Vonage, AT&T and Gizmo. Our ex-perimental results demonstrate that a man-in-the-middle or remote at-tacker could transparently 1) hijack selected E 911 calls and impersonate the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP); and 2) spoof the voicemail servers of both the caller and the callee of selected VoIP calls; and 3) make spam <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> VoIP <b>subscribers</b> even if Do Not Disturb is enabled. These empirical results confirm that leading deployed SIP-based VoIP systems have serious security vulnerabilities...|$|R

40|$|Mobility Management {{is one of}} the {{key issues}} in {{wireless}} communications networks. To deliver an incoming <b>call</b> <b>to</b> a wireless <b>subscriber,</b> the system must keep track of the subscriber by locating the base station that covers the subscriber. As current wireless networks evolve toward personal communications systems (PCS), the fast-growing subscriber density stresses the limited wireless network resources available to support wireless services.

50|$|One example: The tiny unincorporated {{village of}} Beebe Plain, {{divided by the}} Quebec-Vermont border, is served by +1-819-876 Rock Island, Quebec, Canada (a remote station {{controlled}} from Magog) and +1-802-873 Derby Line, Vermont, USA (a remote station controlled from St. Johnsbury). Magog and St. Johnsbury are both a long-distance call from anywhere in Beebe Plain, even though Canadian subscribers can place local <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> Sherbrooke, US <b>subscribers</b> can locally call Newport and an international call within the village is local.

50|$|The {{vision and}} {{goal of the}} architects of the North American Numbering Plan was a system by which {{telephone}} subscribers in the United States and Canada could themselves dial and establish a telephone <b>call</b> <b>to</b> any other <b>subscriber</b> without the assistance of switchboard operators. While this required an expansion of most existing local numbering plans, many of which required only four or five digits to be dialed, or even fewer in small communities, the plan was designed to enable local telephone companies to make as few changes as possible in their systems. Most subscribers should not have to dial a long, full national telephone number to make a local telephone call.|$|R

5000|$|In 1986, NYNEX created Public Access Line Ports {{to serve}} New York's five boroughs. These PALP's allowed {{businesses}} {{to provide a}} [...] "virtual" [...] central phone service that wasn't encumbered by equipment or line rental. This system had high limits {{to the number of}} calls it could receive at any one time and was perfect for delivering audio information services and billing back the relevant <b>call</b> charges <b>to</b> the <b>subscriber.</b> Nynex created a variety of PALPs, and one iteration was called a 540 line. nytix took advantage of this service and launched their first 540 line in January 1995 on the line number 212 540 8499. The advent of the internet reduced the profitability and value of 540 lines to Verizon, and in 1998 they discontinued the service. nytix was still receiving calls on their 540 line on the day they stopped the service.|$|R
