5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} design of fault-tolerant computer systems, particularly via lockstep systems performing the same operation in parallel. This provides redundancy in case one component should fail, and also allows automatic error detection and error correction if the results differ. These methods can be used to help prevent single event upsets caused by transient errors. Although additional measures may be required in embedded or specialized systems, this method can provide a cost effective approach to achieve n-modular redundancy in <b>commercial</b> <b>off-the-shelf</b> systems.|$|E
5|$|A {{cluster is}} a group of loosely coupled {{computers}} that work together closely, so that in some respects they can be regarded as a single computer. Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster {{do not have to be}} symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical <b>commercial</b> <b>off-the-shelf</b> computers connected with a TCP/IP Ethernet local area network. Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker. The vast majority of the TOP500 supercomputers are clusters.|$|E

However, the Secretary of the Army disapproved the interim approach and directed that the Army look for a more advanced system that would dramatically improve over current helicopter designs.|$|E

40|$|Current {{methods for}} {{concealed}} weapon detection are mainly used at stationary security check-points due to complexity and other serious limitations for real-time outdoor scenarios. A mobile imaging radar is {{considered as a}} proper solution for fast screening of people at mass events because {{of its ability to}} detect both metal and non-metal weapons through clothes. In this thesis, the design of an RF front-end for an UWB Microwave Imaging Radar based on MIMO 2 -D array and multichannel FMCW electronics is presented. Requirements to the design were low power emissions and minimization of data acquisition time, cost and complexity. The UWB technology provides high resolution, while MIMO technique helps reducing the number of required antennas in the 2 -D array, without a net degradation of performance. The final RF-scheme was selected based on the availability of <b>commercial</b> <b>off-the-shelves</b> RF-components. The performance of the designed RF front-end was evaluated both via theoretical analysis and simulations in a dedicated software Advanced Design System (ADS, by Agilent). The obtained results in terms of sensitivity, dynamic range, down-range resolution and measurement speed demonstrate that the proposed solution is feasible for through-dress detection of concealed weapons.

25|$|The Storm SRTV {{is based}} on an {{original}} design by BC Customs (BCC) of Utah, originally submitted for the Ground Mobility Vehicle System (GMV 1.1) competition hosted by SOCOM. It is in the tactical family of SXOR Mobility Vehicles of SXOR Motorsports. It is a highly mobile 2-door off-roading pickup truck design with all-wheel-drive. The light-weight tactical vehicle has a high performance mid-engine for maximum stability with 430 horsepower and 425lb-ft of torque. The SRTV can exceed double its curb weight in payload while performing missions. The engine will run using standard gasoline, 87 Octane or higher, diesel, or JP-8. The SRTV is constructed of MIL-STD aircraft tubing, minimizing weight, maximizing strength, and providing a skeletal base for multiple types of <b>commercial</b> <b>off-the-shelf</b> (COTS) ballistic and blast armoring. The vehicle utilizes identical components with multiple body configurations, hence, it provides multi-role configurations.|$|E
25|$|The system {{initially}} used Siemens-Duewag U2 DC LRVs (originally {{designed for}} German metros, {{and used by}} the Frankfurt U-Bahn. The slightly earlier Edmonton Light Rail Transit, and the slightly later San Diego Trolley were built at approximately {{the same time and}} used the same <b>commercial</b> <b>off-the-shelf</b> German LRVs rather than custom-designed vehicles such as were used on the Toronto streetcar system and the Vancouver Skytrain. U2 vehicles constituted the entire fleet in Calgary until July 2001, when the first Siemens SD-160 cars were delivered. A total of 83 of the original U2 DCs were delivered to Calgary over three separate orders; 27 in 1981, 3 in 1983, and 53 in 1984 and are numbered 2001 – 2083. Today, 80 out of the original 83 U2 DCs remain in service. The success of the first North American LRT systems inspired Siemens to build an LRV plant in Florin, California. Siemens now supplies one-third of North American LRVs and has supplied over 1000 vehicles to 17 North American systems. This will include 258 vehicles for Calgary when the current order of Siemens S200 vehicles is completed.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Rockwell {{sold its}} {{military}} and aerospace division, including {{responsibility for the}} Collins combat system, to Boeing. Boeing attempted to produce a workable combat system, but believed that this could only be done if the changes in technology were accounted for in a contract alteration, which the RAN and the Australian Government initially refused to do. Boeing then requested assistance from Raytheon, and after further negotiations with the Government resulted in a reduction of the system capabilities, the companies were able to stabilise the system and deliver Release 2.0 {{at the end of}} 1999. Boeing sold its naval systems division to Raytheon in May 2000, making the latter company solely responsible for completion of the combat system. After this, the submarine project began investigating ideas for a new combat system. Because there was not enough time to evaluate the replacement system to include it in the [...] "fast track" [...] program, Dechaineux and Sheean were fitted with the old Rockwell combat system, which was enhanced by the addition of sub-systems developed during the early 1980s for the Oberon-class mid-life upgrade and <b>commercial</b> <b>off-the-shelf</b> components.
