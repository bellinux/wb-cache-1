We find that the sender prefers communicating by private messages if the receivers' average bias is high, and by public messages if the receivers' average bias is low and the receivers are sufficiently polarized. When {{both public and private}} messages are allowed, the sender can combine the <b>commitment</b> <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> public communication with the flexibility of private communication and transmit more information to the receivers than under either private or public communication scenarios.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{performance}} of various communication protocols in a generalization of the Crawford-Sobel (1982) model of cheap talk that allows for multiple receivers. We find that whenever the sender can communicate informatively with both receivers by sending private messages, she can communicate informatively by sending public messages. In particular, {{it is possible that}} informative communication with one or both receivers is impossible in private, but possible in public. When the sender is allowed to send both public and private messages, it is possible for the sender to combine the <b>commitment</b> <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> public communication with the flexibility <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> private communication and transmit more information to the receivers than under either private or public communication scenarios. When the players can communicate through a mediator and the receivers are biased in the same direction, it is optimal for the sender to communicate with the receivers through independent private noisy communication channels.

This study aims to integrate the organizational <b>commitment</b> <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> Hansen, Sandvik and Selnes (2003) with the affective commitment and the calculative commitment presented by Jones et al.

The research attempts to understand the factors and the effects of different commitments on consumer’s loyalty and consumer’s willing to continue consumptions under the agent’s services from the different insurance companies. The 300 consumers serviced by insurance agents are selected as research samples. The research method is applied questionnaires analyzed by multiple Hierarchical Regression analysis.

Estimates of materiel <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> the USSR to the Republicans vary between 634 and 806 aircraft, 331 and 362 tanks and 1,034 to 1,895 artillery pieces.

40|$|Stapled Finance {{refers to}} a lending <b>commitment</b> <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> an {{investment}} bank that is advising a seller in an M&A setting. The key features are that whoever wins the bidding contest has the option (but not the obligation) to accept the loan offer; and {{the details of the}} loan are known in advance (loan size, interest rate, etc.) Arranging stapled finance has become common, and it is taken up by many private equity funds. This paper shows that it is not simply a method to speed up an M&A transaction, or to eliminate the risk of a deal falling through because the winning bidder cannot put together a financing package. We show that the option of accepting a preapproved loan affects the bidding, which becomes more competitive. The seller benefits, because stapled finance increases the expected price. However, the lender cannot expect to break even when offering stapled finance and must be compensated for offering the loan. Even after doing so, the net benefit of arranging stapled finance for the seller is strictly positive. We also show that the benefits of stapled finance accrue only if the pool of bidders includes financial buyers, for example LBO funds...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of allometric equations to estimate tree phytomass in Turkey oak stands in Tuscany. Biomass estimation is a basic tool to study the ecosystem, which is currently taking on a greater importance due to the <b>commitments</b> <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> the Climate Convention and the Kyoto Protocol. The high costs of the field measurements of tree biomass calls {{for the application of}} indirect methods, such as the largely-applied biomass equations, allowing to calculate phytomass values using variables easily measurable in the field, such as tree diameter and height. The equations described here have been developed for Turkey oak coppices undergoing conversion into high forests. Such stands are nowadays more and more common because of the progressive suspension of timber harvesting on an increased part of the original coppice area. We report five equations: the first one to estimate stem volume, and the followings to estimate each phytomass component (stem, branches, and slash) and the total tree above-ground phytomass. Tree diameter at breast height and total tree height were used as independent variables (predictors). All equations were developed on the same model and the additivity of the phytomass components in respect to the total phytomass was achieved. Equation parameters showed a fairly good accuracy in the estimation of the dependent variables...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{data from}} the tobacco tax revenue {{statistics}} <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>Germany’s</b> Federal Statistical Office, we analyse the development of sales of various tobacco products. In 2016, per capita consumption of tobacco products taxed in Germany was 918 manufactured cigarettes, 37 cigars/cigarillos, 308 g fine cut (equivalent to 462 cigarettes), and 31 g of (water) pipe tobacco. Between 1991 and 2016, the sale of manufactured cigarettes decreased by nearly half, while the sale of fine cut increased by around two thirds. If the amount of fine cut is expressed as cigarette equivalents (whereby 1 kg of fine cut equals 1, 500 cigarettes) and added {{to the number of}} manufactured cigarettes sold, then cigarette sales have decreased by one third since 1991. Numerous facts indicate that measures implemented {{in the context of a}} more restrictive tobacco control policy, such as tax increases and smoking bans, have contributed to this decrease in tobacco sales...|$|R
