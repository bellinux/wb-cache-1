50|$|One {{reason for}} the drift is that the {{intensity}} of B increases as Earth is approached. The gyration around the guiding field line is therefore not a perfect circle, but curves a little more tightly on the side closer to the Earth, where the larger B gives a smaller Rg. This <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>curvature</b> makes ions advance sideways, while electrons, which gyrate in the opposite sense, advance sideways in the opposite direction. The net result, as already noted, produces the ring current, though additional effects (like non-uniform distribution of plasma density) also affect the result.|$|E

50|$|The {{principles}} of geometric design {{apply to the}} jerk oriented orthogonally to the path of motion, considering the centripetal acceleration, whereas the velocity along the path {{is assumed to be}} constant, and so the tangential jerk is zero. Any <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>curvature</b> of the path implies non-zero jerk, arising from purely geometric reasons. To avoid the unbounded (centripetal) jerk when moving from a straight path into a curve or vice versa, track transition curves are constructed, which limit the jerk by gradually increasing the centripetal acceleration, i.e. the curvature, to the value that belongs to the radius of the circle and the speed of travel. The theoretical optimum is achieved by the Euler spiral, which linearly increases the acceleration, i.e., constant jerk. As a design rule a maximum value of 0.5 m/s3 and for convenience purposes a value of 0.35 m/s3 are recommended in railway design. The picture shows a piece of an Euler spiral leading as track transition curve from a straight line to an arc of a circle. In the real scenario the plane of the track is inclined {{in the course of the}} curve and so also this vertical acceleration of the necessary lifting of the center of mass of the rail car has to be considered to minimize the wear on the embankment and the tracks by following a slightly different curve. This has been patented as the Wiener Kurve (Viennese Curve).|$|E

However, the effect of local properties on {{the perception of the}} global object has so far received little attention. In this study, cylinders with an elliptical cross section and rectangular blocks were used to investigate the effect and relative importance of curvature, <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>curvature</b> and edges, as local properties, on the ability of subjects to determine the orientation of the stimuli, which is a global property. We found that when curvature was present the threshold to determine the orientation was 43 percent lower than when curvature was absent. When, in addition, the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>curvature</b> could be felt, the threshold was 37 percent lower than when only curvature could be felt. Finally, when edges were felt during exploration, the threshold increased by 46 percent compared to when the subjects were instructed to avoid the edges in the blocks. We conclude that the perception of curvature and <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>curvature</b> improve the performance of humans in perception of the whole shape, whereas edges, when not directly contributing to the task, disrupt performance. © 2012 IEEE...|$|E

Studies investigating this hypothesis employing an experimental pain relief model have failed to isolate pain relief in their interventions. Therefore {{the purpose of this}} study was to investigate the immediate effects of pain relief on dynamic lumbar curvature. Twenty acute and 20 chronic LBP sufferers had their dynamic curvature measured using a novel fibre-optic device during flexion, extension and lifting before and after administration of oral analgesics. Peak curvature changes were examined using paired t-tests, numbers of responders to pain relief and <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> lumbar <b>curvature</b> sequencing were compared between groups using Chi-squared testing. A significant reduction in movement evoked pain was achieved. A significant reduction in kyphosis at end range flexion and lifting was identified for the acute LBP group following pain relief. No significant differences were observed for the chronic low back pain (CLBP) group. Neither the acute nor chronic LBP group were more likely to respond to pain relief by demonstrating alterations <b>in</b> peak <b>curvature</b> or <b>in</b> lumbar sequencing behaviour. These results demonstrate simple targeted pain relief did not result in gains <b>in</b> peak <b>curvature</b> challenging the assumption of movement alteration being possible through pain relief.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{formation}} of nanodrops on curved surfaces (both convex and concave) by means of molecular dynamics simulations, where the particles interact via a Lennard-Jones potential. We find that the contact angle is not affected by the curvature of the substrate, in agreement with previous experimental findings. This means that the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>curvature</b> of the drop {{in response to the}} <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>curvature</b> of the substrate can be predicted from simple geometrical considerations, under the assumption that the drop's shape is a spherical cap, and that the volume remains unchanged through the curvature. The resulting prediction is in perfect agreement with the simulation results, for both convex and concave substrates. In addition, we calculate the line tension, namely by fitting the contact angle for different size drops to the modified Young equation. We find that the line tension for concave surfaces is larger than for convex surfaces, while for zero curvature it has a clear maximum. This feature is found to be correlated with the number of particles in the first layer of the liquid on the surface...|$|E
