40|$|Abstract Background Previously {{we found}} that Rad 54 /Rad 54 B cells are more {{sensitive}} towards mitomycin C (MMC) as compared to wild-type (WT) cells. This difference in sensitivity was absent upon exposure to other <b>clastogens</b> like bleomycin (BLM) and γ-radiation. In order to get further insight into possible underlying mechanisms, gene expression changes in WT and Rad 54 /Rad 54 B MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) after exposure to the <b>clastogens</b> MMC and BLM were investigated. Exposures of these cells to mutagens (N-ac-AAF and ENU) and vehicle were taken as controls. Results Most exposures resulted in an induction of DNA damage signaling and apoptosis genes and a reduced expression of cell division genes in cells of both genotypes. As expected, responses to N-ac-AAF were very similar in both genotypes. ENU exposure {{did not lead to}} significant gene expression changes in cells of both genotypes, presumably due to its short half-life. Gene expression responses to <b>clastogens,</b> however, showed a genotype-dependent effect for BLM and MMC. MMC treated Rad 54 /Rad 54 B MEFs showed no induction of p 53 -signaling, DNA damage response and apoptosis as seen for all the other treatments. Conclusion These data support our finding that different types of <b>clastogens</b> exist and that responses to these types depend on the DNA repair status of the cells. </p...|$|R

In addition, staining micronuclei with antikinetochore antibodies from CREST serum discriminates aneugenic from clastogenic damage. The use of the micronucleus test in rats, however, has been problematic because the spleen of adult rats efficiently removes micronucleated erythrocytes from the blood. In the present study, we have treated 5 -day-old rats with either X-rays (a <b>clastogen)</b> or vinblastine (an aneugen) and measured micronuclei in erythrocytes from the blood and liver.

Seven separate tests carried out between October 1985 and May 1986 all gave positive results of varying degree depending on the time of year.

40|$|The {{importance}} of chromosomal aberrations as a proximate cause of bone marrow toxicity is discussed. Since chemicals {{that can cause}} nondisjunction are rare, numerical aberrations (aneuploidy, polyploidy) are not ordinarily important. Many structural aberrations, however, can lead directly to cell death and so are proximate causes of toxicity when they occur. The micronucleus test which utilizes the polychromatic erythrocyte is capable of detecting agents (<b>clastogens)</b> that can cause such structural aberrations. Many carcinogens can be detected by this test, and recent changes in the protocol may increase the success rate. Nevertheless only {{a small proportion of}} chemicals are <b>clastogens.</b> The {{importance of}} cell division in the expression of chromosomal damage and the stage of the cell cycle at the time of exposure on the amount of damage is emphasized.

40|$|Most {{theories}} of the mechanisms of chromosomal aberrations involve the concepts of <b>clastogens</b> directly acting on DNA to produce strand breaks, and subsequently, the survival of these directly caused DNA strand breaks - or misrepairs of them - through to metaphase when they appear as chromosomal 'breaks' or translocations. Nevertheless, various observations are inconsistent with these theories such {{as the fact that}} many chemical <b>clastogens</b> (e. g. caffeine, acridines) do not covalently react with DNA, while almost all of the chemical <b>clastogens</b> (e. g. alkylating agents) which do react covalently with DNA, do not directly cause DNA strand breaks. This paper reviews the 'direct-clastogen damage to DNA' theories, and the phenomenology of chromosomal aberrations which are inconsistent with them. Then the theory is considered that the breaks in chromosomes seen at metaphase and anaphase are not the survivors of DNA breaks directly induced by <b>clastogens,</b> but rather derive from breaks created by the enzymes which repair damaged DNA. After that, newer knowledge is reviewed that (i) strand breaks are created during normal DNA unravelling (by topoisomerases), during DNA synthesis, and during DNA repairs, and these breaks can be single- or double-stranded, (ii) breaks variously associated with unravelling, synthesis and repair can occur 'anywhere, anytime' (pre-synthesis, synthesis or post-synthesis) in the cell cycle, and (iii) the enzyme assemblies for DNA unravelling, synthesis and repair which make and religate the breaks must be non-covalently tethered {{to the ends of the}} DNA strands while the breaks created by the enzymes are in existence. It is then suggested that all the morphological types and other phenomena of chromosomal aberrations can be explained by aspects, mechanisms and effects of failures of this tethering function. Circumstances involving the basic mechanism (failure of DNA-end-tethering function while enzyme-created breaks are in existence) are described which might result in 'gaps', translocations ('exchanges'), complex lesions such as 'triradials', as well as in 'minutes', amplifications and inversions.

40|$|Distinguishing between <b>clastogens</b> and {{aneugens}} {{is vital}} in cancer risk assessment because the default {{assumption is that}} <b>clastogens</b> and aneugens have linear and non-linear dose-response curves, respectively. Any observed non-linearity must be supported by mode of action (MOA) analyses where biological mechanisms are linked with dose-response evaluations. For aneugens, the MOA has been well characterised as disruptors of mitotic machinery where chromosome loss via micronuclei (MN) formation is an accepted endpoint used in risk assessment. In this study we performed the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay and immunofluorescence mitotic machinery visualisation in human lymphoblastoid (AHH- 1) and Chinese Hamster fibroblast (V 79) cell lines after treatment with the aneugen 17 -b-oestradiol (E 2). Results were compared to previously published data on bisphenol-A (BPA) and Rotenone data.

Here, structures of Mre 11 –Rad 50 complexes define the Mre 11 2 -helix Rad 50 binding domain (RBD) that forms a 4 -helix interface with Rad 50 coiled-coils adjoining the ATPase core. Newly identified effector and basic-switch helix motifs extend the ABC-ATPase signature motif to link ATP-driven Rad 50 movements to coiled-coils binding Mre 11, implying a ~ 30 Å pull on the linker to the nuclease domain.

Mitomycin C and colchicine were used as positive controls for <b>clastogen</b> and aneugen, respectively, and these compounds produced the expected responses. The fluorescence in situ hybridization assay with a centromeric DNA probe for erythrocyte micronuclei showed that epirubicin is not only clastogenic but also aneugenic in somatic cells in vivo. By using the BrdU-incorporation assay, it could be shown that the meiotic delay caused by epirubicin in germ cells was approximately 48 h. Disomic and diploid sperm were shown in epididymal sperm hybridized with DNA probes specific for chromosomes 8, X and Y after epirubicin treatment. The observation that XX- and YY-sperm significantly prevailed over XY-sperm indicates missegregation during the second meiotic division. The results also suggest that earlier prophase stages contribute less to epirubicin-induced aneuploidy.

40|$|Genotoxic {{agents are}} {{a major threat to}} the integritiy of {{chromosomes}} and viability of cells, specially if the damage is not repaired, because it can lead to chromosome instability, cell cycle arrest, cell dysfunction, induction of apoptosis or carcinogenesis. For genotoxicity, two main endpoints are gene mutations and chromosome aberrations; the latter can either be structural (clastogenic) or numerical (aneugenic). There are several in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests available. However, none of these tests are capable to detect both endpoints of genotoxicity simultaneously. The pUR 288 mouse model, carrying the lacZ transgene on a plasmid vector, used for this thesis, is in theory capable of detecting large deletions (> 500 base pairs) in addition to small deletions and point mutations. Since it was not previously demonstrated that the pUR 288 mouse model is indeed sensitive enough to detect <b>clastogens,</b> a second mouse model was used, the Rad 54 /Rad 54 B deficient mice. This model has a defect in the repair of chromosomal aberrations, caused by <b>clastogens.</b> Determination of the lacZ mutant frequency (lacZ MF) as well as hybridization studies showed that the Rad 54 /Rad 54 B deficient mice are only moderately more sensitive towards <b>clastogens</b> as compared to pUR 288 mice. It was concluded that, although still a promising test, both in vivo models were not sensitive enough to detect the effect of exposure to <b>clastogens.</b> In contrast to the in vivo studies, the in vitro studies using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from pUR 288 and Rad 54 /Rad 54 B mice, have shown a dose-dependent induction in the lacZ MF and the micronuclei frequency (for the MNT) after exposure to both mutagens as well as <b>clastogens</b> in both MEFs models. Moreover, MMC-treatment resulted in a higher lacZ MF in Rad 54 /Rad 54 B MEFs compared to pUR 288 MEFs. This genotype effect after MMC-exposure, also shown in microarray studies, was due to an impaired DNA damage response in MMC-treated Rad 54 /Rad 54 B MEFs. This will lead to a weaker DNA repair response and therefore a larger percentage of the cells will carry a lacZ mutation, hence a higher lacZ MF in the Rad 54 /Rad 54 B MEFs compared to pUR 288 MEFs. Since MMC induces predominantly DNA crosslinks, the obtained results suggests that the Rad 54 and/or Rad 54 B genes are involved in DNA crosslink damage recognition and repair. As a conclusion, the lacZ MF assay using pUR 288 MEFs is able to detect both mutagens as well as <b>clastogens</b> simultaneously. Using this in vitro test can be of great advantage, since this can lead to a {{reduction in the number of}} tests needed. The reduction in time and costs and the increase in the sensitivity make this in vitro lacZ assay a good alternative for existing tests for screening of genotoxic compounds. However, before this test can be used as a high-throughput screenings test, it needs to be validated with a wider range of genotoxic compounds, non-genotoxic compounds, non-carcinogens and most importantly also low potency genotoxic compounds. Then it can be assessed whether this assay is reproducible and whether the results obtained can replace existing genotoxicity assay...|$|R

Currently, this assay is mostly performed with cytochalasin B, which prevents cytokinesis, resulting in polynucleated cells.

In order to evaluate mononucleates to distinguish between aneu-genic and clastogenic effects, we tested some typical aneu-gens and <b>clastogens</b> in whole blood lymphocyte cultures of four donors with the cytokinesis block micronucleus (CBMN) assay. Results showed that the aneugens diethyl-stilbestrol (80 mM), griseofulvin (25 mg/ml) and vincristine sulphate (15 mg/ml) increased MN frequencies in mono-nucleated and binucleated cells, whilst the <b>clastogens</b> mitomycin C (500 ng/ml), bleomycin (6 mg/ml) and doxo-rubicin (20 mg/ml) increased MN frequency only in binucleates.

Fanconi anemia cells are highly sensitive to DNA <b>clastogen</b> agents, but their response to ionizing radiation is still unclear. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the in vitro radiosensitivity of Fanconi anemia homozygotes and heterozygotes, and to assess the contribution of catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) to the overall radiobiological response of the cells. The incidence of radiation-induced lymphocyte micronuclei was used as the indicator of radiation sensitivity in vitro, whereas the activity of antioxidant enzymes was determined in erythrocytes. Patients with FA exhibited a two-fold decrease in catalase activity, accompanied by lowered activity of SOD, and increased incidence of baseline micronuclei. In the entire group of patients (with one exception), a reduced yield of radiation-induced micronuclei in lymphocytes was observed, and this was categorized as a radioresistant response. A mild radioresistant in vitro response was also observed in carrier-mothers, accompanied by reduced activity of catalase. The radiosensitivity of carrier-fathers was normal. The results of this study suggest that reduced activity of catalase is an important contributor to the radiobiological response of cells...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — There {{have been}} several {{suggestions}} of biomarkers that are specific to high LET radiation. Such a biomarker could significantly increase the power of epidemiological studies of individuals exposed to densely-ionising radiations such as alpha particles (e. g. radon, plutonium workers, individuals exposed to depleted uranium) or neutrons (e. g. radiation workers, airline personnel). We discuss here a potentially powerful high LET biomarker (the H value) which is the ratio of induced inter-chromosomal aberrations to intra-arm aberrations. Both theoretical and experimental {{studies have suggested that}} this ratio should differ by a factor of about three between high LET radiation and any other likely <b>clastogen,</b> and will yield more discrimination than the previously suggested F value (ratio of inter-chromosomal aberrations to intra-chromosomal inter-arm aberrations). Evidence of the long-term stability of such chromosomal biomarkers has also been generated. Because these stable intra-arm and inter-chromosomal aberrations are (1) frequent and (2) measurable at long times after exposure, this H value appears to be a practical biomarker of high LET exposure, and several in vitro studies have confirmed the approach for unstable aberrations. The approach is currently being tested in a population of Russian radiation workers exposed several decades ago to high- or low LET radiation...|$|E

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{micronucleus}} assay is broadly used, {{but is not}} per se able to discriminate aneugenic from clastogenic compounds, and cytotoxicity can be a confounding factor. In vitro genotoxicity assays generally rely on cell lines with limited metabolic capabilities. Recently, the use of histone H 2 AX and H 3 phosphorylation markers (γH 2 AX and p-H 3) was proposed to discriminate aneugenic from clastogenic chemicals. The aim {{of the present study}} was to develop a new genotoxic screening strategy based on the use of the γH 2 AX and p-H 3 biomarkers in combination with cell lines with distinct biotransformation properties. First, we tested a training set of 20 model chemicals comprised of 10 aneugens, five <b>clastogens</b> and five cytotoxics on three human cell lines (HepG 2, LS- 174 T and ACHN). Our data confirm the robustness of these two biomarkers to discriminate efficiently <b>clastogens,</b> aneugens and misleading cytotoxic chemicals in HepG 2 cells. Aneugenic compounds induced either an increase or a decrease in p-H 3 depending on their mode of action. <b>Clastogens</b> induced γH 2 AX, and cytotoxic compounds generated a marked decrease in these two biomarkers. Moreover, the use of different cell lines permits to discriminate direct from bioactivated genotoxins without the need of an exogenous metabolic activation system. Finally, we further evaluated this strategy using a test set of 13 chemicals with controversial genotoxic potential. The resulting data demonstrate that the combined analysis of γH 2 AX and p-H 3 is an efficient strategy.

A test system based on cultured human primary cells could potentially provide better prediction compared to animal tests, increasing patient safety while also implementing the 3 Rs principle, i. e. replace, reduce and refine. Hereby, we describe {{the development of an}} in vitro micronucleus assay based on animal-free ex vivo culture of human red blood cells from hematopoietic stem cells. To validate the method, five <b>clastogens</b> with direct action, three <b>clastogens</b> requiring metabolic activation, four aneugenic and three non-genotoxic compounds have been tested. Also, different metabolic systems have been applied. Flow cytometry was used for detection and enumeration of micronuclei. Altogether, the results were in agreement with the published data and indicated that a sensitive and cost effective in vitro assay to assess genotoxicity with a potential to high-throughput screening has been developed.

40|$|Approval and {{registration}} of drugs requires a comprehensive {{assessment of their}} genotoxic potential. In recent years, genetic toxicity testing has moved towards the earlier stages of drug discovery {{in order to identify}} genotoxicity liabilities as soon as possible. The in-vitro micronucleus assay is a widely used screening test which shows a high level of concordance with regulatory chromosomal aberration assays. Traditionally, micronucleus detection is done through manual reading of slides. We describe the validation of an automated method for in-vitro micronucleus analysis, using 96 -well plates and automated image analysis. The advantages of this method (small amount of compound required, rapid turnaround times, and objective/consistent scoring) make it ideal for early genotoxicity screening. We show that this assay can accurately detect micronucleus induction by <b>clastogens</b> (mitomycin C, bleomycin) and aneugens (colchicines, diethylstilbestrol, etoposide, griseofluvine). We also describe the incorporation of a metabolic activation system that allows the detection of micronucleus induction by indirect <b>clastogens</b> such as cyclophosphamide. We also describe the incorporation of two cytotoxicity indexes to this assay: the cytokinesis-block proliferation index (CBPI) and total cell counts. These indexes complement each other and help in the interpretation of micronucleus data...|$|R
40|$|Fanconi anemia (FA) is {{a genetic}} disease {{characterized}} by progressive pancytopenia and cancer susceptibil­ity. The clinical and cellular phenotypes of Fanconi anemia {{are associated with}} a set of redox abnormalities, indicating that FA is an oxidative stress-related disorder. Fanconi anemia cells are highly sensitive to DNA <b>clastogen</b> agents, but their response to ionizing radiation is still unclear. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the in vitro radiosensitivity of Fanconi anemia homozygotes and heterozygotes, and to assess the contribution of catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) to the overall radiobiological response of the cells. The incidence of radiation-induced lymphocyte micronuclei was used as the indicator of radiation sensitivity in vitro, whereas the activity of antioxidant enzymes was determined in erythrocytes. Patients with FA exhibited a two-fold decrease in catalase activity, accompanied by lowered activity of SOD, and increased incidence of baseline micronuclei. In the entire group of patients (with one exception), a reduced yield of radiation-induced micronuclei in lymphocytes was observed, and this was categorized as a radioresistant response. A mild radioresistant in vitro response was also observed in carrier-mothers, accompanied by reduced activity of catalase. The radiosensitivity of carrier-fathers was normal. The results of this study suggest that reduced activity of catalase is an important contributor to the radiobiological response of cells...|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{cytogenetics}} {{has been}} established as a valid method for evaluating the genotoxic potential of chemical agents. 1, 2 Armstrong et al' 3 have described a simple, quantitative approach to in vitro cytotoxicity and genotoxicity testing by using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. This approach can also be sen sitive and repeatable in an inter-laboratory setting, a prerequisite for routine testing of compounds suspected of having genotoxic properties. In the present study, cytotoxicity was evaluated by the parameter of mitotic index (MI). Genotoxicity {{is measured by the}} chromosome aberration (Abs) assay as described by Armstrong et al 3 using CHO cells. The basic analytic principles proposed were extended to include human lymphocytes. Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) analysis was used to establish an additional endpoint. Mito mycin C (MMC), an established <b>clastogen,</b> was used as the model compound for protocol validation. Dose response curves for MI and Abs in CHO cells were found to be consistent with those reported by Armstrong et al. 3 Results from our extended study on lymphocytes and using SCE analysis were analo gous. Our experience is that this standardized approach is indeed sensitive and reliable and can serve as a basis for an inter-laboratory testing program...|$|E
40|$|The {{mammalian}} Rad 51 {{protein is}} involved in homologous recombination and in DNA damage repair. Its nuclear distribution after DNA damage is highly dynamic, and distinct foci of Rad 51 protein, distributed throughout the nuclear volume, are induced {{within a few hours}} after γ irradiation; these foci then coalesce into larger clusters. Rad 51 -positive cells do not undergo DNA replication. Rad 51 foci colocalize with both replication protein A and sites of unscheduled DNA repair synthesis and may represent a nuclear domain for recombinational DNA repair. By 24 h postirradiation, most foci are sequestered into micronuclei or assembled into Rad 51 -coated DNA fibers. These micronuclei and DNA fibers display genome fragmentation typical of apoptotic cell death. Other repair proteins, such as Rad 52 and Gadd 45, are not eliminated from the nucleus. DNA double strand breaks in repair-deficient cells or induced by the <b>clastogen</b> etoposide are also accompanied by the sequestering of Rad 51 protein before cell death. The spindle poison colcemid causes cell cycle arrest and Rad 51 -foci formation without directly damaging DNA. Collectively, these observations suggest that mammalian Rad 51 protein associates with damaged DNA and/or with DNA that is temporarily or irreversibly unable to replicate and these foci may subsequently be eliminated from the nucleus...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous and clastogen-induced {{chromosomal}} {{instability in}} a high-risk group (i. e, 33 patients with rectal carcinomas) was investigated using peripheral blood lymphocytes as target cells. In {{addition to the}} analysis of spontaneous and clastogen-induced chromosome aberrations, this study also included classical karyotype analysis and scoring of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) in some of the patients. Diepoxybutane (DEB), 4 -nitroquinoline- 1 -oxide (NQO), and bleomycin were used as standard <b>clastogens.</b> Lymphocytes of healthy control individuals were studied in parallel with each cancer patient. While only slight but significant differences could be detected of the average spontaneous, DEB- and bleomycin (G 2) -induced chromosome breakage between patient and control lymphocytes, individual patients and two of the control individuals showed a more distinct increase in the frequency of the studied end points. These increases were documented by a variegated mosaicism of karyotypic changes and by an increased breakage rate induced by the <b>clastogens.</b> Neither the bleomycin-exposure in the G 1 phase nor SCE was capable of detecting differences between the patients and controls. Of particular interest in the sense of high-risk individuals were seven patients and two control persons whose lymphocytes exhibited increased chromosomal sensitivity under more than one of the studied experimental conditions...|$|R
40|$|If mouse {{bone marrow}} {{preparations}} {{are treated with}} a classical C-banding procedure, {{it may be possible}} to distinguish between micronuclei with or without centromeres. This allows discrimination between micronuclei originating from chromosome breakage and those originating from chromosome loss. Thus, using C-banding, the micronucleus test can be used not only for the detection of <b>clastogens</b> but also aneugens. In this way, more exhaustive methods such as immunological staining using antikinetochore antibodies may not be necessary. © 1988 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.
