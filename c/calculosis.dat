40|$|Fibromyalgia, {{a chronic}} {{syndrome}} of diffuse musculoskeletal pain and somatic hyperalgesia from central sensitization, is very often comorbid with visceral pain conditions. In fibromyalgia patients with gallbladder <b>calculosis,</b> this study assessed {{the short and}} long-term impact of laparoscopic cholecystectomy on fibromyalgia pain symptoms. Fibromyalgia pain (VAS scale) and pain thresholds in tender points and control areas (skin, subcutis and muscle) were evaluated 1 week before (basis) and 1 week, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after laparoscopic cholecystectomy in fibromyalgia patients with symptomatic <b>calculosis</b> (n = 31) vs <b>calculosis</b> patients without fibromyalgia (n. 26) and at comparable time points in fibromyalgia patients not undergoing cholecystectomy, with symptomatic (n = 27) and asymptomatic (n = 28) <b>calculosis,</b> and no <b>calculosis</b> (n = 30). At basis, fibromyalgia+symptomatic <b>calculosis</b> patients presented a significant linear correlation {{between the number of}} previously experienced biliary colics and fibromyalgia pain (direct) and muscle thresholds (inverse) (p< 0. 0001). After cholecystectomy, fibromyalgia pain significantly increased and all thresholds significantly decreased at 1 week and 1 month (1 -way ANOVA, p< 0. 01 -p< 0. 001), the decrease in muscle thresholds correlating linearly with the peak postoperative pain at surgery site (p< 0. 003 -p< 0. 0001). Fibromyalgia pain and thresholds returned to preoperative values at 3 months, then pain significantly decreased and thresholds significantly increased at 6 and 12 months (p< 0. 05 -p< 0. 0001). Over the same 12 -month period: in non-fibromyalgia patients undergoing cholecystectomy thresholds did not change; in all other fibromyalgia groups not undergoing cholecystectomy fibromyalgia pain and thresholds remained stable, except in fibromyalgia+symptomatic <b>calculosis</b> at 12 months when pain significantly increased and muscle thresholds significantly decreased (p< 0. 05 -p< 0. 0001). The results of the study show that biliary colics from gallbladder <b>calculosis</b> represent an exacerbating factor for fibromyalgia symptoms and that laparoscopic cholecystectomy produces only a transitory worsening of these symptoms, largely compensated by the long-term improvement/desensitization due to gallbladder removal. This study provides new insights into the role of visceral pain comorbidities and the effects of their treatment on fibromyalgia pain/hypersensitivity...|$|E
40|$|In {{patients}} with gall bladder <b>calculosis,</b> the complication as {{common bile duct}} stones (CBDS) occurs in 10 %- 12 % of cases and represents a serious disease which has to be recognized and treated in time. Diagnostic procedure that verifies the presence of CBDS is intraoperative cholangiography (IOC). Despite simplicity and safety of this method, solving technical and organizational details before its usage is required, and some percentage of failure and complications tend to occur. Hence, {{there is still a}} controversy whether this procedure should be used non-selectively or selectively. The aim of our study was to examine in which cases of gall bladder <b>calculosis</b> IOC has to be used. In a retrospective study, 150 patients operated for CBDS were analyzed. We formed a simple and unique scoring system with five parameters for prediction of this disease: diameter of common bile duct > 8 mm, gall bladder <b>calculosis</b> < 5 mm, high serum level of bilirubin, elevated levels of ALP and ALT in serum. The value of scoring system was confirmed in a prospective group of 100 patients, operated for gall bladder <b>calculosis</b> and subjected to IOC. After scoring, all patients were divided into three risk groups for CBDS presence: low, medium and high. Comparison of results for suspected CBDS (confirmed by scoring) and existing CBDS (confirmed by IOC) has demonstrated a high level of scoring system precision and its practical usage value in the election of {{patients with}} gall bladder <b>calculosis</b> who need IOC...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Biliary <b>calculosis</b> {{is rare in}} children. It occurs {{associated}} with different haemolytic and non-haemolytic disorders, which are sometimes also combined. Case Outline. A 15 -year-old male was hospitalized due to biliary <b>calculosis</b> and non-conjugated hyper-bilirubinemia. A mild non-conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, without anaemia and other symptoms of liver dysfunction, was registered at age 8 years, and 7 years later cholelithiasis with transitory choledocholithiasis. The finding of ellyptocytes in blood smear, which was also verified in mother, normal haemoglobin count {{and the absence of}} diseases followed by secondary dysmorphic erythrocytes of this type, indicated a clinically milder (compensated) hereditary ellyptocytosis, while more than a double increase of non-conjugated serum bilirubin fracture after a three-day hypocaloric diet (400 kcal per day) showed the concurrent presence of Gilbert’s syndrome. In the laparascopically removed gallbladder a larger number of small pigmented calculi were disclosed. Conclusion. Gilbert’s syndrome is an essential precipitating factor of biliary <b>calculosis</b> in patients with chronic haemolytic condition. Thus, in all cases of biliary <b>calculosis</b> and non-conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with absent clinical and laboratory parameters of liver disorders and anaemia, except in compensated haemolytic disease and Gilbert’s syndrome as isolated disorders, a possibility of their association should be taken into consideration...|$|E

40|$|Urinary colics from <b>calculosis</b> are {{frequent}} and intense forms of pain whose current pharmacological treatment remains unsatisfactory. New {{and more effective}} drugs are needed to control symptoms and improve stone expulsion. Recent evidence suggested that the Nitric Oxide (NO) / cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) /phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE 5) system may contribute to ureteral motility influencing stone expulsion. We investigated if PDE 5 inhibitors and sGC stimulators influence ureteral contractility, pain behaviour and stone expulsion in a rat model of ureteral <b>calculosis.</b> We investigated: a) the sex-specific PDE 5 distribution in the rat ureter; b) the functional in vitro effects of vardenafil and sildenafil (PDE 5 inhibitors) and BAY 41 - 2272 (sGC stimulator) on induced ureteral contractility in rats and c) the in vivo effectiveness of vardenafil and BAY 41 - 2272, alone and combined with ketoprofen, vs hyoscine-N-butylbromide alone or combined with ketoprofen, on behavioural pain indicators and stone expulsion in rats with artificial <b>calculosis</b> in one ureter. PDE 5 was abundantly expressed in male and female rats' ureter. In vitro, both vardenafil and BAY 41 - 2272 significantly relaxed pre-contracted ureteral strips. In vivo, all compounds significantly reduced number and global duration of "ureteral crises" and post-stone lumbar muscle hyperalgesia in <b>calculosis</b> rats. The highest level of reduction of the pain behaviour was observed with BAY 41 - 2272 among all spasmolytics administered alone, and with the combination of ketoprofen with BAY 41 - 2272. The percentage of stone expulsion was maximal in the ketoprofen+BAY 41 - 2272 group.

We reviewed 5 patients (1 male and 4 females, mean age 48. 6 years), with a history of urinary tract infection, renal pain or haematuria. All patients underwent renal ultrasonographic assessment in both clinostatic and orthostatic position. Three patients underwent intravenous pyelography before ultrasound. Ultrasonography showed a sonolucent "levelled" image with a posterior acoustic shadow inside a hydro-caliceal dilation (2 pts.) or caliceal diverticulum (3 pts.); the persistence of the "level" in both clinostatic and orthostatic position allowed an immediate diagnosis in all patients. Intravenous pyelography performed before renal ultrasound showed no abnormality in 1 patient and was misleading in two; it otherwise confirmed the diagnosis when performed after renal ultrasonography. Three patients underwent surgery, two patients refused therapy; sonographic follow-up showed no evolution of the morphologic picture. Once considered as exceptional, liquid renal <b>calculosis</b> still remains rare pathology and accounts for 0. 6 % of all the urinary lithiasis diagnosed by ultrasound in our series.

From 1888 when Tizzoni and Foggi performed the first orthotopic derivation on animals, and 1913 when Lemoin declared the first orthotopic derivation in humans {{there has been a}} constant improvement and modification of orthotopic urinary diversion after radical cystectomy which significantly decrease the number and severity of postoperative complications. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare complications regarding the direct and antireflux ureter-neobladder anastomosis. Methods. This retrospective study included 79 selected patients operated over the last ten years having medical records available. Previously, we excluded the patients with prior radiation therapy, systemic illness, diabetes mellitus, previous history of <b>calculosis</b> and metabolic disorders etc. Hautmann orthotopic technique was used in almost 70 % of the patients. We analyzed complications regarding direct and antireflux ureter-neobladder anastomosis with a median follow-up period of 4, 72 years. We followed-up the appearance of unilateral and bilateral hydronephrosis, forming of renal stones in the patients without previous history of renal <b>calculosis,</b> and renal insuficiency caused by stenosis on the site of anastomosis. We used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Mann-Whitney U test, Student's t test i χ² test for statistic analysis. Results. The median age of the patients was 68, 2 years. Totally 88. 61 % of the patients were male and 11. 39 % were female. The direct anastomotic technique secundum Wallace was used in 43. 03 % of the operated patients and antireflux technique secundum Le Duc in 56. 97 %. Renal deterioration caused by stenosis on the site of the ureter-neobladder anastomosis was statistically significantly higher in the antireflux anastomosis compared to direct anastomosis (χ²= 4. 71, p = 0. 0299). No one of the patients with direct anastomosis had poucho-ureteral reflux higher grade than gr III. Conclusion. In our study, complication as renal deterioration as a result of stenosis on the site of the ureter anastomosis was significantly more common in the group of patients exposed to antireflux technique...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: In {{this paper}} we report our {{results in the}} {{treatment}} of renal staghorn stones by percutaneous lithotripsy (PCNL) with or without extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). METHODS/RESULTS: Over a period of 5 years, 244 patients with renal <b>calculosis</b> were treated by PCNL in our Department. Seventy-four of these were cases of renal staghorn calculosis: 44 presented a partial staghorn stone and in 30 cases the stone formation completely occupied the pyelocalieal cavity. We performed first a PCNL via a rigid nephroscope. Stones were crushed using an ultrasonic lithotrite; an electrohydraulic probe was used when the calculus was resistant to ultrasound. The patients were submitted to one or more percutaneous treatments followed by extracorporeal lithotripsy to complete the operation, when required. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of stone: the first group comprised 59 patients with a partial or complete simple staghorn stone and the second comprised 15 patients with a complete complex staghorn stone. Complete resolution was achieved in 55 of the 59 cases (93. 2...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{incidence}} of symptomatic urinary lithiasis in pregnancy is low, it is potentially serious in that it can cause serious renal damage, systemic sepsis or even endanger the pregnancy. Spurious <b>calculosis</b> in pregnancy must be a very unusual occurrence but does pose significant difficulties in diagnosis and management. A high index of clinical suspicion and analysis of calculi produced by the patient, should lead to the diagnosis. Case report: A 26 year old female was admitted in the 25 th week of her second pregnancy {{with a history of}} severe right loin pain and vomiting. She was apyrexic and tender in the right iliac fossa. She passed a small calculus on the following day, which on analysis consisted of calcium oxalate. As the right iliac fossa pain did not subside after passage of the stone, a limited film intravenous urogram was performed and showed a normal pelvicalyceal system, mild dilatation of the right ureter, but no further stones. Because of continuing severe pain and the finding of ureteric dilatation, in the absence of infection, ureteroscopy wa...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of urinary tract <b>calculosis</b> continuously progresses. The triggering {{event in the}} process of stone formation is decreased urinary level of crystallizing inhibitors. The aim of our study was to investigate whether the existing stone or applied therapeutic procedure - extracorporeal shock waves lithotripsy (ESWL) - has effect to urinary levels of Mg, citrate and pyrophosphate. Study included 128 patients with the upper urinary tract stones. ESWL using the Lithostar (Siemens) device was used as a mode of treatment. Out of all patients, 76 (59 %) were free of stone particles before 1 month, while 52 (41 %) had residual stone fragments even 3 months after ESWL. Mg, citrate and pyrophosphate were measured in 24 hurine specimens: before, between days 2 and 3, as well as 1 and 3 months after ESWL. The analysis of the results revealed that stone itself had no effect on urinary crystallizing inhibitors. Detected increased urinary levels of Mg, citrate and pyrophosphate after ESWL, compared with pre-treatment values, could be attributed to applied therapeutic procedure...|$|E
