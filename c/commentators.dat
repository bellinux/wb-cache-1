5|$|During the 18th century, {{appreciation}} of Bashō's poems grew more fervent, and <b>commentators</b> such as Ishiko Sekisui and Moro Nanimaru {{went to great}} length to find references in his hokku to historical events, medieval books, and other poems. These <b>commentators</b> were often lavish in their praise of Bashō's obscure references, {{some of which were}} probably literary false cognates. In 1793 Bashō was deified by the Shinto bureaucracy, and for a time criticizing his poetry was literally blasphemous.|$|E
