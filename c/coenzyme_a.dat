5|$|The acetyl group, {{formally}} {{derived from}} acetic acid, {{is fundamental to}} all forms of life. When bound to <b>coenzyme</b> <b>A,</b> it {{is central to the}} metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. Unlike longer-chain carboxylic acids (the fatty acids), acetic acid does not occur in natural triglycerides. However, the artificial triglyceride triacetin (glycerine triacetate) is a common food additive and is found in cosmetics and topical medicines.|$|E
5|$|Examples of biologically {{important}} {{fatty acids}} include the eicosanoids, derived primarily from arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, that include prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes. Docosahexaenoic acid {{is also important}} in biological systems, {{particularly with respect to}} sight. Other major lipid classes in the fatty acid category are the fatty esters and fatty amides. Fatty esters include important biochemical intermediates such as wax esters, fatty acid thioester <b>coenzyme</b> <b>A</b> derivatives, fatty acid thioester ACP derivatives and fatty acid carnitines. The fatty amides include N-acyl ethanolamines, such as the cannabinoid neurotransmitter anandamide.|$|E
5|$|Pyruvate {{molecules}} {{produced by}} glycolysis are actively transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane, {{and into the}} matrix where they can either be oxidized and combined with <b>coenzyme</b> <b>A</b> to form CO2, acetyl-CoA, and NADH, or they can be carboxylated (by pyruvate carboxylase) to form oxaloacetate. This latter reaction ”fills up” the amount of oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle, and is therefore an anaplerotic reaction, increasing the cycle’s capacity to metabolize acetyl-CoA when the tissue's energy needs (e.g. in muscle) are suddenly increased by activity.|$|E

50|$|PLP is {{the active}} form of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine or pyridoxal). PLP is a {{versatile}} catalyst, acting as <b>a</b> <b>coenzyme</b> in <b>a</b> multitude of reactions, including decarboxylation, deamination and transamination.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Coenzyme</b> M is <b>a</b> <b>coenzyme</b> {{required}} for methyl-transfer reactions in the metabolism of methanogens. The <b>coenzyme</b> is <b>an</b> anion with the formula [...] It is named 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate and abbreviated HS-CoM. The cation is unimportant, but the sodium salt is most available. Mercaptoethanesulfonate contains both a thiol, {{which is the}} main site of reactivity, and a sulfonate group, which confers solubility in aqueous media.|$|R
5|$|Some non-proteinogenic {{amino acids}} are {{not found in}} proteins. Examples include 2-aminoisobutyric acid and the {{neurotransmitter}} gamma-aminobutyric acid. Non-proteinogenic amino acids often occur as intermediates in the metabolic pathways for standard amino acids– for example, ornithine and citrulline occur in the urea cycle, part of amino acid catabolism (see below). A rare exception to the dominance of α-amino acids in biology is the β-amino acid beta alanine (3-aminopropanoic acid), which is used in plants and microorganisms in the synthesis of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), a component of <b>coenzyme</b> <b>A.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} set of catabolic {{reactions}} in animals can be separated into three main stages. In the first stage, large organic molecules, such as proteins, polysaccharides or lipids, are digested into their smaller components outside cells. Next, these smaller molecules are taken up by cells and converted to smaller molecules, usually acetyl <b>coenzyme</b> <b>A</b> (acetyl-CoA), which releases some energy. Finally, the acetyl group on the CoA is oxidised to water and {{carbon dioxide in the}} citric acid cycle and electron transport chain, releasing the energy that is stored by reducing the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) into NADH.|$|E
5|$|Coenzymes {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} {{that can be}} loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another. Examples include NADH, NADPH and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Some coenzymes, such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), and tetrahydrofolate (THF), are derived from vitamins. These coenzymes cannot be synthesized by the body de novo and closely related compounds (vitamins) must be acquired from the diet. The chemical groups carried include the hydride ion (H−) carried by NAD or NADP+, the phosphate group carried by adenosine triphosphate, the acetyl group carried by <b>coenzyme</b> <b>A,</b> formyl, methenyl or methyl groups carried by folic acid and the methyl group carried by S-adenosylmethionine.|$|E
50|$|Coenzyme F420 or 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin is <b>a</b> <b>coenzyme</b> {{involved}} in redox reactions in methanogens, in many Actinobacteria, and sporadically in other bacterial lineages.

5|$|Proteins {{based on}} {{cobalamin}} use corrin {{to hold the}} cobalt. Coenzyme B12 features a reactive C-Co bond that participates in the reactions. In humans, B12 has two types of alkyl ligand: methyl and adenosyl. MeB12 promotes methyl (-CH3) group transfers. The adenosyl version of B12 catalyzes rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine. Methylmalonyl <b>coenzyme</b> <b>A</b> mutase (MUT) converts MMl-CoA to Su-CoA, {{an important step in}} the extraction of energy from proteins and fats.|$|E

25|$|Pantothenic acid {{is used in}} the {{synthesis}} of <b>coenzyme</b> <b>A</b> (CoA). <b>Coenzyme</b> <b>A</b> may act as an acyl group carrier to form acetyl-CoA and other related compounds; {{this is a way to}} transport carbon atoms within the cell. CoA is important in energy metabolism for pyruvate to enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) as acetyl-CoA, and for α-ketoglutarate to be transformed to succinyl-CoA in the cycle. CoA is also important in the biosynthesis of many important compounds such as fatty acids, cholesterol, and acetylcholine. CoA is incidentally also required in the formation of ACP, which is also required for fatty acid synthesis in addition to CoA.|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{experiments}} {{point to}} fatty acyl <b>coenzymes</b> <b>A</b> (acyl-CoAs) rather than {{unesterified fatty acids}} as the small-molecule ligands regulating DNA binding by the FadR protein of Escherichia coli. To provide an in vivo test of this specificity, unesterified fatty acids were generated within the cellular cytosol. These fatty acids {{were found to be}} efficient modulators of FadR action only when the acids could be converted to acyl-CoAs...|$|R
50|$|Pyridoxal {{phosphate}} (PLP, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, P5P), {{the active}} form of vitamin B6, is <b>a</b> <b>coenzyme</b> in <b>a</b> variety of enzymatic reactions. The Enzyme commission has catalogued more than 140 PLP-dependent activities, corresponding to ~4% of all classified activities. The versatility of PLP arises from {{its ability to}} covalently bind the substrate, and then {{to act as an}} electrophilic catalyst, thereby stabilizing different types of carbanionic reaction intermediates.|$|R
30|$|To {{investigate}} the pH stability, the recombinant AcCR was incubated at 4  °C in varying pHs from 4.5 to 9.5 and tested the reduction activity using NADH as <b>coenzyme.</b> <b>As</b> shown in Fig.  5 c, the optimal storage pH was 6.5, at which pH almost 80 % relative activity remained after 96  h. Almost 70 % relative activities remained at both pH 7.0 and 7.5 after 96  h, {{as well as}} at pH 6.0 after 75  h. The results showed that the recombinant AcCR had broad pH tolerant scope and excellent pH stability.|$|R
25|$|Arsenic's {{toxicity}} {{comes from}} the affinity of arsenic(III) oxides for thiols. Thiols, {{in the form of}} cysteine residues and cofactors such as lipoic acid and <b>coenzyme</b> <b>A,</b> are situated at the active sites of many important enzymes.|$|E
25|$|Once {{inside the}} cell long-chain-fatty-acid—CoA ligase catalyzes the {{reaction}} between a fatty acid molecule with ATP (which is broken down to AMP and inorganic pyrophosphate) {{to give a}} fatty acyl-adenylate, which then reacts with free <b>coenzyme</b> <b>A</b> to give a fatty acyl-CoA molecule.|$|E
25|$|The mevalonate pathway {{serves as}} the basis for the {{biosynthesis}} of many molecules, including cholesterol.

25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that histidine residue His122 of serotonin N-acetyl transferase is the catalytic residue that deprotonates the primary amine of 5-hydroxytryptamine, which allows the lone pair on the amine to attack acetyl-CoA, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. The thiol from <b>coenzyme</b> <b>A</b> serves as a good leaving group when attacked by a general base to give N-acetylserotonin.|$|E
25|$|The enzyme {{works by}} {{cleaving}} the adenosylcobalamin C-Co(III) bond, giving the carbon and cobalt (III) atoms each an electron. The cobalt then fluctuates between its two oxidation states: Co(II) and Co(III). In {{this way the}} adenosylcobalamin works as a reversible free radical generator. The cobalt therefore donates an electron back to the methylmalonyl-CoA backbone in order to transfer the <b>coenzyme</b> <b>A</b> group.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} myelin damage {{resulting from}} B12 deficiency, {{even in the}} presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem. It has been connected to B12 most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl <b>coenzyme</b> <b>A</b> into succinyl <b>coenzyme</b> <b>A.</b> Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal fatty acid synthesis, or it will be incorporated into fatty acids itself rather than normal malonic acid. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is subacute combined degeneration of the central nervous system and spinal cord. Whatever the cause, it is known that B12 deficiency causes neuropathies, even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.|$|E

Reduced DPN+ and reduced analogs of DPN+ exist predominantly with the B side of the dihydropyridine ring folded against the adenine moiety. (The oxidized coenzymes appear to exist in the same folded structure.) Furthermore, the ribose protons undergo very little conformational change upon reduction of the pyridine ring; this observation strongly suggests a considerable similarity between the folded forms of the oxidized and reduced <b>coenzymes.</b> <b>A</b> model of the folded structure is presented...|$|R

25|$|Cholinergic neurons—acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is {{released}} from presynaptic neurons into the synaptic cleft. It {{acts as a}} ligand for both ligand-gated ion channels and metabotropic (GPCRs) muscarinic receptors. Nicotinic receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels composed of alpha and beta subunits that bind nicotine. Ligand binding opens the channel causing influx of Na+ depolarization and increases the probability of presynaptic neurotransmitter release.
