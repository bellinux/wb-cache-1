5|$|Bus {{services}} are provided to numerous stations. Most bus services provide feeding to the metro system where possible, {{and then do}} not <b>continue</b> <b>into</b> town. However, since the metro operates solely into town, instead of across it, many buses operate between stations on different lines, or provide alternative routes across town.|$|E
50|$|Craig {{was famous}} {{for a number of}} annual musical concerts. His first annual Christmas {{reception}} occurred in 1880 and <b>continued</b> <b>into</b> the early 1900s. Similarly, in 1880 he presented his first Annual May Festival which also <b>continued</b> <b>into</b> the 1900s. Possibly the most well renowned annual concert was his pre-lenten reception which took place at Palm Garden in New York and <b>continued</b> <b>into</b> the 1910s.|$|R

5|$|The alpine meadows <b>continue</b> <b>into</b> {{the harsh}} alpine tundra zone, where poor soil, heavy snowfall, cold temperatures, {{and a very}} short growing season {{discourage}} all but the hardiest sedge grasses, heathers, and lichens.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} {{was expected}} to <b>continue</b> <b>into</b> October 19 east of the Appalachians, however, extensive cloud cover prevented any significant severe storms from developing although several wind reports were reported in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Massachusetts.

5|$|Carless {{makes an}} {{impressive}} speech in Persian {{to convince the}} drivers to <b>continue</b> <b>into</b> Nuristan. They climb an extremely indistinct track to the pass. They descend into Nuristan: it grows hot. Men run to meet them: they are told {{they are the first}} Europeans ever to cross the pass (Newby doesn't believe this). They are given ice-cold milk to drink.|$|E

5|$|Many {{of the new}} routes {{terminated}} at the Anacostia Station {{rather than}} <b>continue</b> <b>into</b> downtown Washington, as they once had. WMATA officials admitted that fares for most Anacostia residents would rise an average of 50 percent, and that Anacostia residents {{would be forced to}} pay more and travel farther to access the services (such as doctors) and shopping that most District residents can readily access. To help mediate the impact of the total fare increase on Anacostia residents, WMATA reduced basic bus fares for many routes in the area from $1 to 35 cents.|$|E
5|$|NY78 and Transit Road remain four lanes, passing several {{commercial}} {{businesses and}} entering an intersection with NY33 (Genesee Street) and crossing over Ellicott Creek. The route crosses over a former railroad grade, soon intersecting with CR324 (Aero Drive). Just after CR324, NY78 and Transit Road enter an intersection with the feeder roads to exit49 of the New York State Thruway (I-90). NY78 and Transit Road <b>continue</b> <b>into</b> {{the town of}} Clarence. After crossing Wehrle Drive (CR290 and CR275), the four-lane boulevard crosses into the town of Amherst.|$|E
5|$|Some American {{settlers}} {{claimed that}} smallpox could be prevented through the ingestion of lettuce, and an Iranian belief suggested {{consumption of the}} seeds when afflicted with typhoid. Folk medicine has also claimed it {{as a treatment for}} pain, rheumatism, tension and nervousness, coughs and insanity; scientific evidence of these benefits in humans has not been found. The religious ties of lettuce <b>continue</b> <b>into</b> the present day among the Yazidi people of northern Iraq, who have a religious prohibition against eating the plant.|$|E

5|$|Cully and his thugs arrive as the McCoys try to leave. A violent gunfight ensues in the halls, stairwell, and {{elevator}}; all Cully's men {{are killed}} but one, who Doc allows to run away. Cully himself dies when Doc shoots the cables {{of the elevator}} he is in and it crashes {{to the bottom of}} the shaft. Rudy comes to his senses, follows Doc and Carol outside onto a fire escape, and shoots at them. Doc returns fire and kills him. With the police on the way, the couple hijack a pickup truck and force the driver, a cooperative old cowboy, to take them to Mexico. After crossing the border, Doc and Carol pay the cowboy $30,000 for his truck. Overjoyed, the cowboy heads back to El Paso on foot, while the couple <b>continue</b> <b>into</b> Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In mid-October, Rushâ€™s son, Huey, was murdered, leading Obama {{to put his}} {{campaign}} on hold. Governor George Ryan called the Illinois Legislature to a special session to re-enact a package of gun-safety bills, a pet issue of Rush, which had been overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court. Obama supported the package, but the session dragged on towards Christmas. Obama annually spent the Christmas vacation in Hawaii with his family visiting his grandmother, who raised him. Obama left Illinois, expecting the session would <b>continue</b> <b>into</b> January. However, a crucial vote took place earlier than expected, failing by five votes with Obama and others absent. Obama came under fire for missing the vote though {{he said he would}} have flown back sooner, but his 18-month-old daughter was sick. Meanwhile, Rush received an outpouring of sympathy that aided {{his campaign}}.|$|E
5|$|Major {{restoration}} {{work was}} carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 1860s, funded by the rector, Charles Kemble. The work included the installation of fan vaulting in the nave, which was not merely a fanciful aesthetic addition but a completion of the original design. Oliver King had arranged for the vaulting of the choir, to a design by William and Robert Vertue. There are clues in the stonework that King intended the vaulting to <b>continue</b> <b>into</b> the nave, but that this plan was abandoned, probably for reasons of cost. In addition a stone screen between the choir and nave was removed. Scott's work was completed by his pupil Thomas Graham Jackson in the 1890s including work on the west front.|$|E

5|$|The Pulaski Skyway {{ends at the}} Tonnele Circle with US 1/9 Truck and Route 139, and US 1/9 {{continue}} north along at-grade Tonnelle Avenue toward North Bergen, {{where the}} road intersects Route 3 and Route 495. Crossing into Bergen County, Broad Avenue carries US 1/9 through Fairview and Ridgefield before heading into Palisades Park. Here, the two routes join US 46, and the combined road heads north into Fort Lee. US 1/9/46 come to an interchange with I-95, US 9W, and Route 4, where it joins I-95 to head east to the George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River. At this point, US 46 ends and I-95 and US 1/9 <b>continue</b> <b>into</b> Manhattan, New York City on the Trans-Manhattan Expressway.|$|E
5|$|The {{short-term}} use of benzodiazepines adversely affects multiple {{areas of}} cognition, {{the most notable}} one being that it interferes with the formation and consolidation of memories of new material and may induce complete anterograde amnesia. However, researchers hold contrary opinions regarding the effects of long-term administration. One view {{is that many of}} the short-term effects <b>continue</b> <b>into</b> the long-term and may even worsen, and are not resolved after stopping benzodiazepine usage. Another view maintains that cognitive deficits in chronic benzodiazepine users occur only for a short period after the dose, or that the anxiety disorder is the cause of these deficits.|$|E
5|$|US 46 {{continues}} southeast as a four-lane freeway, {{with the}} US1-9 ramps following the route {{a short distance}} before merging into the route. At this point, US1-9 become concurrent with US 46 and the freeway makes a sharp turn to the north-northeast. The road has an interchange to the 5th Street and 6th Street frontage roads, which parallel the freeway through residential areas and provide access to CR 501. US1-9/ US46 <b>continue</b> <b>into</b> Fort Lee, where it has access to a couple commercial areas via RIRO before encountering the northern terminus of Route 63 at a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. From here, the highway becomes a surface road that continues past more businesses and homes with RIRO access, angling northeast as it comes to an exit for Main Street. Immediately past this point, the road turns east and encounters a complex interchange with I-95, the eastern terminus of Route 4, and the southern terminus of US 9W. Here, US1-9/ US46 all join I-95 (although US46 is unsigned east of this interchange) and continue to the southeast along a multilane freeway with local-express lane configuration consisting of four local lanes and four express lanes in each direction, passing numerous high-rise buildings. The road has an interchange with Route 67 at GWB Plaza {{before coming to the}} eastbound toll plaza for the George Washington Bridge. Past the toll plaza, there is an interchange for the Palisades Interstate Parkway. After the Palisades Interstate Parkway, the road crosses the Hudson River on the George Washington Bridge, which has eight lanes total on the upper deck (formed from the express lanes) and six lanes total on the lower deck (formed from the local lanes). At the New Jersey/New York border on the bridge, US46 ends while I-95 and US1-9 <b>continue</b> <b>into</b> the borough of Manhattan in New York City on the Trans-Manhattan Expressway.|$|E
50|$|Route 51 is {{a highway}} in southeastern Missouri.

5|$|US20A joins NY64 here, {{following}} the latter for about , allowing US20A to terminate at its parent, US20, here concurrent with NY5, at an intersection in East Bloomfield. At this point, NY64 turns west onto US 20 and NY 5. The three routes head westward across mostly open fields, meeting the southern terminus of NY444 {{south of the}} former village of Holcomb. Past the junction, which once served as the eastern terminus of NY20C, US 20, NY 5, and NY 64 <b>continue</b> <b>into</b> the village of Bloomfield before NY64 breaks from NY5 and US20 and turns northward toward Rochester once again.|$|E
5|$|While the SSG {{secured the}} ground floor of the mosque, they {{continually}} received fire from the mosque's minarets. This slowed the operation's progress. On the mosque roof, militants had piled sandbags {{at the base of the}} minarets, which they now used as steps to shoot at troops below. After the minarets were taken, the SSG progressed deeper into the complex, and the militants threw gasoline bombs in an unsuccessful attempt to set fire to the mosque and stop the assault. Once {{the ground floor}} was secured, the SSG attempted to enter the Jamia Hafsa madrasah adjoining the mosque but were delayed by booby traps, which had to be disabled before they could <b>continue</b> <b>into</b> the complex.|$|E
5|$|With {{the exodus}} of several {{manufacturing}} companies, the area's industrial economy began to decline during the early 20th century. By the 1920s, competition from the South and Midwest, followed by the Great Depression, led {{to the collapse of}} the three main industries in Massachusetts: textiles, shoemaking, and precision mechanics. This decline would <b>continue</b> <b>into</b> the later half of the century; between 1950 and 1979, the number of Massachusetts residents involved in textile manufacturing declined from 264,000 to 63,000. The 1969 closure of the Springfield Armory, in particular, spurred an exodus of high-paying jobs from Western Massachusetts, which suffered greatly as it de-industrialized during the last 40 years of the 20th century.|$|E
