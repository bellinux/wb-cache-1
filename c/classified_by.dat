40|$|While the {{clinical}} syndrome of melanoma was described {{during the nineteenth}} century, the pathology, aetiology and classification of the tumour remained controversial well into the twentieth. For instance, {{the debate about the}} type of tumour, its aetiology, classification and the relationship between pigmented moles and melanoma were common. This debate was widely regarded as settled by the 1960 s, and we are now accustomed to think of melanoma as a single pathological and aetiological entity, with a number of possible clinical manifestations. A number of systems of classification are in common use. We may <b>classify</b> <b>by</b> site. So melanoma may occur on the skin (cutaneous), on the palms, soles and under the nails (acral) or on mucosal surfaces (mucosal). We may <b>classify</b> <b>by</b> tumour morphology – so tumours may be superficial spreading or nodular. Or we may <b>classify</b> <b>by</b> combinations of site and morphology. There are problems for these unificatory classifications, however. For instance, certain types of tumour (acral in particular) have widely varying incidence by race. A more significant challenge arises from recent research findings, especially the discovery that various genetic mutations (notably c-KIT and BRAF) seem to correlate with particular sub-types of melanoma. Their aetiological role i...|$|R
