5|$|Hospice {{care in the}} United States is a {{type and}} {{philosophy}} of end-of-life care which focuses on the palliation of a terminally ill patient's symptoms. These symptoms can be physical, emotional, spiritual or social in nature. The concept of hospice {{as a place to}} treat the incurably ill has been evolving since the 11th century. Hospice care was introduced to the United States in the 1970s in response to the work of <b>Cicely</b> Saunders in the United Kingdom. This part of health care has expanded as people face a variety of issues with terminal illness. In the United States, it is distinguished by extensive use of volunteers and a greater emphasis on the patient's psychological needs in coming to terms with dying.|$|E

5|$|On 11 November 1916, Howell {{was among}} a group of 200 Australian {{applicants}} selected for a transfer to the Royal Flying Corps to undergo flight training. Shipped to the United Kingdom, he was posted to No.1 Royal Flying Officers' Cadet Battalion at Durham for his initial instruction. On graduating as a pilot, he was formally discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 16 March 1917 and commissioned as a probationary second lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps the following day. Howell was posted to No.17 Reserve Squadron in April, where his rank was made substantive. Appointed a flight officer on 25 July, he was attached to the Central Flying School for duties. On 12 September, Howell wed <b>Cicely</b> Elizabeth Hallam Kilby in a ceremony at St Stephen's Anglican Church, Bush Hill Park.|$|E
5|$|The first hospices are {{believed}} to have originated in the 11th century, when {{for the first time the}} terminally ill were permitted into places dedicated to treatment by Crusaders. In the early 14th century, the order of the Knights Hospitaller of St. John of Jerusalem opened the first hospice in Rhodes, meant to provide refuge for travelers and care for the ill and dying. The hospice practice languished until revived in the 17th century in France by the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul and, later, by the Irish Sisters of Charity, who opened St Joseph's Hospice in London, England in 1902. In the 1950s at St. Joseph's, <b>Cicely</b> Saunders developed many of the foundational principles of modern hospice care. She later founded St Christopher's Hospice in London.|$|E
25|$|Rebecca West {{was born}} <b>Cicely</b> Isabel Fairfield in 1892 in Kerry {{and grew up}} in a home full of {{intellectual}} stimulation, political debate, lively company, books and music. Her mother, Isabella, a Scotswoman, was an accomplished pianist but did not pursue a musical career after her marriage to Charles Fairfield. The Anglo-Irish Charles had been a Confederate stretcher-bearer at the siege of Richmond in the U.S. Civil War, had returned to the UK to become a journalist of considerable reputation but financial incompetence, deserted his family when <b>Cicely</b> was eight years old. He never rejoined them and died impoverished and alone in a boarding house in Liverpool in 1906, when <b>Cicely</b> was 14. The rest of the family moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, where <b>Cicely</b> was educated at George Watson's Ladies College. She had to leave school in 1907 due to a bout of tuberculosis. <b>Cicely</b> did not have any formal schooling after the age of 16, due to lack of funds.|$|E

6000|$|Perhaps {{it might}} be done at a price--that of <b>Cicely's</b> jewels, of which she alone knew the hiding-place, and with them a deed of {{indemnity}} against her persecutors. Emlyn was not minded to give either. Moreover, she guessed that {{it might be}} in vain. Once outside those walls, they knew too much to be allowed to live. And yet within those walls <b>Cicely's</b> child {{would not be allowed to}} live--the child that was heir to all. What, then, could loose them and make them safe? ...|$|R

Sanger's father converted to Quakerism soon after his two sons were born and brought up the children as Quakers. Sanger's mother was the daughter of a wealthy cotton manufacturer and had a Quaker background, but was not a Quaker.|$|E
