6000|$|... "No; I'm in here," [...] came in {{the voice}} of Tubbs. [...] "And--I'm almost frozen to--to--death." [...] The last words with a <b>chattering</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> that told only too plainly how the rich youth was suffering.|$|E
60|$|During {{his walk}} a violent <b>chattering</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> {{in a glass}} case on the {{sidewalk}} seemed at first to draw his attention (with a qualm), to a restaurant before which it was set; but a second glance revealed the electric letters of a dentist's sign high above the next door.

60|$|Our sufferings {{from cold}} and wet were far greater than our sufferings from hunger. We managed to keep the child warm; but, I doubt if any one else among us ever was warm for five minutes together; and the shivering, and the <b>chattering</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth,</b> were sad to hear. The child cried a little at first for her lost playfellow, the Golden Mary; but hardly ever whimpered afterwards; and when {{the state of the}} weather made it possible, she used now and then to be held up in the arms of some of us, to look over the sea for John Steadiman's boat. I see the golden hair and the {{innocent}} face now, between me and the driving clouds, like an angel going to fly away.|$|E
6000|$|But {{before long}} both Fynes became frightened. After {{a period of}} immobility {{in the arms of}} Mrs Fyne, the girl, who had not said a word, tore herself out from that {{slightly}} rigid embrace. She struggled dumbly between them, they did not know why, soundless and ghastly, till she sank exhausted on a couch. Luckily the children were out with the two nurses. The hotel housemaid helped Mrs Fyne to put Flora de Barral to bed. She was as if gone speechless and insane. She lay on her back, her face white like a piece of paper, her dark eyes staring at the ceiling, her awful immobility broken by sudden shivering fits with a loud <b>chattering</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> in the shadowy silence of the room, the blinds pulled down, Mrs Fyne sitting by patiently, her arms folded, yet inwardly moved by the riddle of that distress of which she could not guess the word, and saying to herself: [...] "That child is too emotional-- much too emotional to be ever really sound!" [...] As if anyone not made of stone could be perfectly sound in this world. And then how sound? In what sense--to resist what? Force or corruption? And even in the best armour of steel there are joints a treacherous stroke can always find if chance gives the opportunity.|$|E

6000|$|The others waited, two vague shapes nearly mingled {{together}} {{in the darkness of}} the veranda, from which issued a sudden <b>chattering</b> <b>of</b> Mr. Jones's <b>teeth,</b> directly suppressed, and a slight shuffle of Ricardo's feet.

60|$|They fled, {{groping for}} their usual shelter--it might be almost called their home--in the old calaboose; came drenched into its empty chambers; and lay down, three sops of humanity, {{on the cold}} coral floors, and presently, when the squall was overpast, the others could hear in the {{darkness}} the <b>chattering</b> <b>of</b> the clerk's <b>teeth.</b>|$|R

5000|$|When {{communicating}} vocally, {{they have}} four {{different types of}} whistles, differing in this from their close relatives, the hoary marmot and the Vancouver Island marmot. The Olympic marmot's whistles include flat calls, ascending calls, descending calls, and trills; {{all of these are}} in a small frequency range of about 2,700 Hz. Flat, ascending, and descending calls are most often voiced singly. The ascending call has a duration of about half a second, starting with a [...] "yell" [...] on one note and ending with a [...] "chip" [...] on a higher note; it is often used as a distress or warning call for unfamiliar smells and noises. These same [...] "yips" [...] are heard when Olympic marmots are play fighting, along with low growls and <b>chattering</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth.</b> The descending call ends on a lower note than the one on which it started. The trill, which sounds like multiple ascending calls put together as one longer sound, consists of multiple ranging notes and is voiced as an alarm call to communicate to other marmots in the area that danger may be approaching and they should return to their burrows. Females with young have the responsibility to watch out for their young and other relatives near the burrow, and therefore voice the trill more often than other Olympic marmots. If marmots are not accustomed to human contact in a certain area, they may also sound a trill when seeing a person, in order to alert other marmots. At places like Hurricane Ridge, where seeing humans is a frequent occurrence, most marmots will not acknowledge human presence at all.|$|E
60|$|Little {{by little}} the fierce <b>chattering</b> <b>of</b> her <b>teeth</b> began to abate as {{the warmth of}} her {{surroundings}} stole through her. I also felt, even in this strangely awakening position, {{the influence of the}} quiet; and sleep began to steal over me. Several times I tried to fend it off, but, as I could not make any overt movement without alarming my strange and beautiful companion, I had to yield myself to drowsiness. I was still in such an overwhelming stupor of surprise that I could not even think freely. There was nothing for me but to control myself and wait. Before I could well fix my thoughts I was asleep.|$|R
5000|$|This fury, {{which was}} called berserkergang, {{occurred}} {{not only in}} the heat of battle, but also during laborious work. Men who were thus seized performed things which otherwise seemed impossible for human power. This condition is said to have begun with shivering, <b>chattering</b> <b>of</b> the <b>teeth,</b> and chill in the body, and then the face swelled and changed its colour. With this was connected a great hot-headedness, which at last gave over into a great rage, under which they howled as wild animals, bit the edge of their shields, and cut down everything they met without discriminating between friend or foe. When this condition ceased, a great dulling of the mind and feebleness followed, which could last for one or several days.|$|R
5000|$|Actor Nicholas Vince {{lived near}} creator Clive Barker, who liked his work. Barker {{suggested}} they work together, {{resulting in a}} collaboration on Hellraiser. As Chatterer, Vince wore a one-piece mask that rendered him blind. A fake set <b>of</b> <b>chattering</b> <b>teeth</b> were fitted {{in his mouth and}} were triggered when he bit down. Because of the difficulty in eating and the drooling associated with the design, the chattering teeth were redesigned to be removable. [...] The design was changed in the sequel to give Chatterer eyes so Vince could see.|$|R
5000|$|Furthermore, Wang Jia's (c. 370) Shiyi ji says Zhang Hua made lethal jiǔyùn chūnjiǔ 九醞春酒 [...] "nine {{fermented}} spring wine" [...] or xiāochángjiǔ 酒腸消 [...] "gut-rotting wine" [...] using {{a special}} ferment and grain he {{obtained from the}} Five Barbarians. This wine [...] "causes <b>chattering</b> <b>of</b> the <b>teeth</b> and apparent drunkenness without shouting or laughter, injuring the liver and intestines" [...] (Needham et al. 1980: 152).When Zhang Hua had attained high office, one of his companions from his childhood came to pay a visit upon him. Hua and his childhood friend drank Nine-fold fermented wine, and caroused with a will. In the evening they both became quite drunk and fell asleep. Hua was accustomed to drinking this wine, and after becoming inebriated, he had his attendants roll him {{from side to side}} while he slept until he woke up. In this way one could consume this wine without coming to harm. However on this occasion, he forgot make arrangements for his friend. Hua's attendants, as usual, rolled him from side to side, but there was no-one who did this to his friend. The following morning, when his friend did not arise, Hua groaned and said, [...] "He must be dead!" [...] and sent someone to see. The wine had indeed oozed out from the man's intestines and had trickled down onto the floor beneath the bed. (tr. Greatrex 1987: 23) ...|$|R
40|$|Machining is an {{industrial}} {{process in which}} parts are shaped by removal of unwanted material in the forms of chips. Manufacturing industry today demands shorter production times and high quality parts at competitive cost. Increased MRR (material removal rate) in milling and turning may provide high productivity but elevated forces and vibrations are still major obstacles to fulfill these requirements. Chatter vibrations may limit the full potential of machining productivity. In this thesis, <b>chatter</b> stability <b>of</b> multi delay systems is investigated. As examples of multi delay systems, variable tooth spacing tools such as variable pitch and helix milling cutters and parallel milling operations are investigated. Although there are few studies about the <b>chatter</b> stability <b>of</b> variable <b>tooth</b> spacing tools, no work has been reported on optimum design for a given cutting condition. Optimization studies are carried out to determine the optimum variable tool geometry and a new design methodology is presented. Moreover, for parallel milling operations, an analytical solution methodology {{which is based on}} frequency domain analysis is proposed to solve the chatter stability {{for the first time in}} the literature. Optimum cutting conditions are identified and effects of process parameters and workpiece dynamics on the <b>chatter</b> stability <b>of</b> parallel milling are shown. Since the operation contains single time delay, optimization studies are carried out to determine the optimum cutter dynamic properties in parallel turning. Simulated conditions are verified by time domain and experimental tests...|$|R
6000|$|I {{was frightened}} by her vehemence, and {{imagined}} some mistake in her incoherent tale; but I no longer hesitated to obey her. She had come by {{herself from the}} Castle, three long miles, at midnight, through the heavy snow; we must reach Englefield Green, {{a mile and a}} half further, before we could obtain a chaise. She told me, that she had kept up her strength and courage till her arrival at my cottage, and then both failed. Now she could hardly walk. Supporting her as I did, still she lagged: and at the distance of half a mile, after many stoppages, shivering fits, and half faintings, she slipt from my supporting arm on the snow, and with a torrent of tears averred that she must be taken, for that she could not proceed. I lifted her up in my arms; her light form rested on my breast.--I felt no burthen, except the internal one of contrary and contending emotions. Brimming delight now invested me. Again her chill limbs touched me as a torpedo; and I shuddered in sympathy with her pain and fright. Her head lay on my shoulder, her breath waved my hair, her heart beat near mine, transport made me tremble, blinded me, annihilated me--till a suppressed groan, bursting from her lips, the <b>chattering</b> <b>of</b> her <b>teeth,</b> which she strove vainly to subdue, and all the signs of suffering she evinced, recalled me to the necessity of speed and succour. At last I said to her, [...] "There is Englefield Green; there the inn. But, if you are seen thus strangely circumstanced, dear Idris, even now your enemies may learn your flight too soon: were it not better that I hired the chaise alone? I will put you in safety meanwhile, and return to you immediately." ...|$|R

5000|$|When {{creating}} a burrow, they use both their forepaws and hind feet {{to assist in}} the work - the forepaws scrape away the soil, which is then pushed out of the way by the hind feet. If there are any stones in the way, the alpine marmot will remove them with its teeth provided that the stones aren't too large. [...] "Living areas" [...] are created {{at the end of a}} burrow, and are often lined with dried hay, grass and plant stems. Any other burrow tunnels that go nowhere are used as toilet areas. Once burrows have been completed, they only host one family, but are often enlarged by the next generation, sometimes creating very complex burrows over time. Each alpine marmot will live in a group that consists of several burrows, and which has a dominant breeding pair. Alpine marmots are very defensive against intruders, and will warn them off using intimidating behavior, such as beating of the tail and <b>chattering</b> <b>of</b> the <b>teeth,</b> and by marking their territory with their scent. One can often see an alpine marmot [...] "standing" [...] while they keep a look-out for potential predators or other dangers. Warnings are given, by emitting a series of loud whistles, after which members of the colony may be seen running for cover.The mating season for alpine marmots occurs in the spring, right after their hibernation period comes to a close, which gives their offspring the highest possible chance of storing enough fat to survive the coming winter. Alpine marmots are able to breed once they reach an age of two years. Dominant females tend to suppress reproduction of subordinates by being antagonistic towards them while they are pregnant which causes stress and kills the young. Once the female is pregnant, she will take bedding materials (such as grass) into the burrow for when she gives birth after a gestation period of 33 - 34 days. Each litter consists of between one and seven babies, though this number is usually three. The babies are born blind and will grow dark fur within several days. The weaning period takes a further forty days, during which time the mother will leave the young in the burrow while she searches for food. After this period, the offspring will come out of the burrow and search for solid food themselves. Their fur becomes the same colour as other alpine marmots by the end of the summer, and after two years they will have reached their full size. If kept in captivity, alpine marmots can live up to 15 - 18 years.|$|R
