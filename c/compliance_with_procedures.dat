25|$|Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs is {{the name}} of two cases of the Singapore courts, a High Court {{decision}} delivered in 1989 and the 1990 judgment in the appeal from that decision to the Court of Appeal. The cases were concerned with the constitutionality of amendments made to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore and the Internal Security Act ("ISA") in 1989. The latter statute authorizes detention without trial on security grounds. These amendments had the effect of changing the law on judicial review of executive discretion under the ISA by re-establishing the subjective test enunciated in the 1971 High Court decision Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs which had been overruled in 1988 by Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs, and limiting the right of judicial review to ensuring <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>procedures</b> specified in the ISA. In other words, the amendments were intended to render the exercise of power by the President and the Minister for Home Affairs under the ISA to detain persons without trial not justiciable by the courts. Both the High Court and Court of Appeal found that these amendments were constitutional because Parliament had done nothing more than enact the rule of law relating to the law applicable to judicial review. Thus, the amendments validly operated to deprive the applicant Teo Soh Lung of the ability to apply to the courts for judicial review.|$|E

50|$|Another {{factor that}} covaries with {{leadership}} style {{is whether the}} person is male or female. When men and women come together in groups, they tend to adopt different leadership styles. Men generally assume an :agentic leadership style. They are task-oriented, active, decision focused, independent and goal oriented. Women, on the other hand, are generally more communal when they assume a leadership position; they strive to be helpful towards others, warm in relation to others, understanding, and mindful of others' feelings. In general, when women are asked to describe themselves to others in newly formed groups, they emphasize their open, fair, responsible, and pleasant communal qualities. They give advice, offer assurances, and manage conflicts {{in an attempt to}} maintain positive relationships among group members. Women connect more positively to group members by smiling, maintaining eye contact and respond tactfully to others' comments. Men, conversely, describe themselves as influential, powerful and proficient at the task that needs to be done. They tend to place more focus on initiating structure within the group, setting standards and objectives, identifying roles, defining responsibilities and standard operating procedures, proposing solutions to problems, monitoring <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>procedures,</b> and finally, emphasizing the need for productivity and efficiency in the work that needs to be done. As leaders, men are primarily task-oriented, but women tend to be both task- and relationship-oriented. However, {{it is important to note}} that these sex differences are only tendencies, and do not manifest themselves within men and women across all groups and situations.|$|E

The theoretical approach in this thesis is based on an MTO perspective in regards to assessing factors that may influence leadership, competence, responsibility, contractors and compliance. <b>Compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>procedures</b> is regarded as safety critical behavior, and the relationship between leadership, competence, responsibility, contractors and compliance has been discussed in light of the data collected and theory found on the subject. A qualitative approach has been used to answer the research problems in the thesis, and nine informants have been interviewed using semi-structured interviews. The informants have, between them, covered a large amount of roles and positions from within the organization where the study was conducted. Important findings in the study include support to the assumption that leadership, competence, responsibility and contractors are all connected to, and affect, <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>procedures.</b> Leadership will affect competence through leaders’ influence on training and development, and their responsibility to ensure a worker has the right competence. In the same way leaders affect compliance through keeping a focus on compliance and involving employees, as well as leading by example. It seems to be important to keep a balance between a worker’s responsibilities and authority, which can be considered to be a leadership task. Also leaders should ensure involvement, inclusion and follow-up of the contractors in order to facilitate compliance. <b>Compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>procedures</b> was considered impossible without some sort of competence, and it seems important that workers feel a responsibility for what they do, in order to improve compliance.

40|$|Campylobacter {{remains the}} most {{commonly}} reported zoonotic agent worldwide. Reducing the concentration of Campylobacter on chicken meat {{is seen as the}} most efficient strategy to diminish the number of human campylobacteriosis cases. Analysis of risk factors related to characteristics of broiler batches and processing conditions could, however, not fully explain differences in impact of processing on contamination levels between slaughterhouses. Our study aimed at investigating whether compliance of food handlers with procedures on setting and controlling evisceration process parameters could explain differences in microbial concentrations on carcasses between slaughterhouses. The study was conducted in two commercial broiler chicken slaughterhouses. Analysis of documentation provided insight in the adequacy of procedures, and observational studies revealed insight in <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>procedures</b> by using a set of criteria for evisceration control. The frequency of carcasses with visible faecal contamination was counted and Escherichia coli concentrations on carcasses classified based on visible contamination was analysed. E. coli was found to be a valid indicator for Campylobacter during evisceration. Food handlers' knowledge, attitude and practices related to evisceration control tasks were analysed based on a validated questionnaire. Documentation analysis revealed obvious differences in the procedures between slaughterhouses. The observation study revealed that in the slaughterhouse with advanced procedures, the food handlers more often complied with these procedures and a lower frequency of carcasses with visible faecal contamination was observed. Carcasses contaminated with visible faecal spots, even at a low level, carried significantly higher concentrations of E. coli than visibly clean carcasses. Food handlers in both slaughterhouses revealed a good knowledge level. The attitude of food handlers differed between slaughterhouses. In one slaughterhouse, where food handlers complied more frequently with procedures their attitude was at a good level, and practices at good and moderate levels. In the other slaughterhouse the attitude of food handlers was at moderate level and practices at moderate and poor levels. In conclusion, the results from our case study suggest that management factors like availability of adequate monitoring procedures and food handlers' compliance with these procedures may influence the bacterial concentrations on carcasses. Our study demonstrated that <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>procedures</b> differed between slaughterhouses, and might be associated with faecal contamination of carcasses and thus with higher bacterial concentrations. These results suggest that managerial improvements, supervising and motivating food handlers could be an important control point. To validate the observed relation between <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>procedures</b> and contamination of carcasses, an intervention study is needed. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{regulatory}} mechanisms and arrangements {{for public service}} organisations have become increasingly complex. In this paper we develop a theoretical framework that emphasises the potential importance of the following regulatory problems: regulatee resistance, ritualistic compliance, regulatory capture, performance ambiguity, and absence of performance data. This framework is applied to arrangements for the regulation of direct labour and direct service organisations in Scotland and Wales prior to the 'Best Value' regime. The results support the practical relevance of the analytical framework. Furthermore, whereas conventional perspectives suggest {{that the source of}} regulatory problems is the behaviour of regulatees, our evidence shows that the behaviour of regulators can also lead to regulatory failure; for example, through ritualistic <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>procedures.</b> The evidence also reveals a previously unidentified problem concerning a 'fear of regulation' on the part of regulators. ...|$|E

In recent decades, new alternative views have expanded the perimeters of accident analyses and opened the way to questioning the assumption of the {{traditional approach}} to the concepts {{of the human being}} and work. These new approaches help to highlight the sterile results of traditional practices: blaming and punishing victims, recommending training, and proposing norms without changing the systems in which the accidents took place.

The authors conclude that despite the unknowns associated with new andmore rigorous public scrutiny of special education outcomes, emerging evidence suggests that the changes will result in better educational outcomes for stu-dents with disabilities as well as a new, more integrated model for special education...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores how {{formalization}} {{of employee}} selection {{procedures for the}} purpose of ensuring equality of opportunity can become so extensive that the intended outcome of fairness is undermined. Drawing on empirical evidence from a large media organization, the analysis reveals the detrimental impact of formalization in relation to the recruitment of ethnic minority staff. While the existing literature describes how, during recruitment of employees, the circumvention of formal equality procedures can occur through managerial neglect and manipulation, the analysis in this paper shows that, paradoxically, circumvention can also occur through <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>procedures.</b> This new category takes three forms (robotic, defensive and malicious) and appears under conditions of excessive formalization ??? the term hyper-formalization is coined to describe this.
