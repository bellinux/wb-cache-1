5|$|Hospice Medical Director: The hospice medical director, a physician, often {{provides}} the most support to the clinical staff providing care to the patient and family. The medical director may also provide medical <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> primary physician is unavailable or if the patient {{does not have a}} primary care provider. The hospice medical director is also required under Medicare to recertify patients.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, certain {{costs are}} {{difficult}} to avoid and are shared by everyone, such as the costs of housing, pensions, education and health <b>care.</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> state does not provide these services, then for those on lower incomes, the costs must be borrowed and often those on lower incomes {{are those who are}} worse equipped to manage their finances. Secondly, aspirational consumption describes the process of middle income earners aspiring to achieve the standards of living enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts and one method of achieving this aspiration is by taking on debt. The result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability.|$|E
25|$|For the {{remainder}} of the 1960s, Presley made films that relied heavily on exotic locations and mundane songs, and he was tied into contracts that he could not escape. Parker did not <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> films were good or bad but only about the profits. When Presley complained to him that he wanted better scripts, Parker reminded him of his lavish lifestyle and that risking $1 million a year for doing practically no work was dangerous. Presley's career stagnated while artists like the Beatles, the Supremes, the Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan dominated the charts. Parker admitted in 1983 that after 1966, the income from Presley films and soundtracks was dramatically reduced.|$|E

25|$|Adoption {{was very}} common, {{especially}} when the father (or mother) was childless or had seen all his children grow up and marry away. The child was then adopted {{to care for the}} parents' old age. This was done by contract, which usually specified what the parent had to leave and what maintenance was expected. The natural children, if any, were usually consenting parties to an arrangement that cut off their expectations. In some cases they even acquired the estate for the adopted child who was to relieve them of <b>care.</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> adopted child failed to carry out the filial duty, the contract was annulled in the law courts. Slaves were often adopted, and if they proved unfilial, were reduced to slavery again.|$|E
25|$|The act, as {{currently}} structured, does not cut present Medicare benefits. It reduces projected future increases in Medicare spending such as inpatient hospital service payments and ambulatory care payments {{that would otherwise}} undergo annual re-adjustments. These changes would save $196 billion from Medicare over 10 years and removing wasteful subsidies to insurers for Medicare Advantage plan would save a further $156 billion according to the CBO. Gail Wilensky, a deputy assistant to President Bush Snr advising him on health and welfare issues from 1992–1993 and previously a director of Medicare and Medicaid has expressed concern that this might affect seniors access to health <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> changes are made too quickly, while other activists such as Stuart Guterman of the Commonwealth Fund argue that Medicare Advantage plans cost the taxpayer $1,000 per policyholder more than if the person had been insured through traditional fee for services.|$|E

Some Dodger players insinuated they would sit out rather than play alongside Robinson. The brewing mutiny ended when Dodgers management took a stand for Robinson. Manager Leo Durocher informed the team, [...] "I do not <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra.

500|$|Upon its release, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 {{received}} critical acclaim. Despite the game's praise, journalists {{heavily criticized}} {{the content of}} [...] "No Russian". Marc Cieslak of BBC News was saddened by the level, as he felt it disproved his theory that the video game industry had [...] "grown up". Rock, Paper, Shotgun Kieron Gillen chastised the level for failing {{to live up to}} expectations. He found the plot to be illogical, criticized the skip feature for rendering an artistic statement as [...] "laughably pathetic", and ultimately summarized the level as [...] "dumb shock". Writing for PC World, Matt Peckham questioned why the gunmen would not <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> player did not shoot, and felt that not informing the player of {{what was about to happen}} until the last possible moment was [...] "creating a kind of plausible emotional deniability by removing all the dramatic impetus that ought to surround it". Several prominent British religious leaders condemned [...] "No Russian": Alexander Goldberg of the London Jewish Forum was worried that children would play the level; Fazan Mohammed of the British Muslim Forum described the level as an intimate experience of enacting terrorism; and Stephen Lowe, the retired Bishop of Hulme, felt that the level was [...] "sickening".|$|E
500|$|Intense media {{interest}} in the opinions and private lives {{of the royal family}} during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true. As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: [...] "Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true—so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards." [...] Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: [...] "The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> stories are true or not." [...] It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation. Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party – Thatcher's political opponents. Thatcher's biographer John Campbell claimed [...] "the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making". Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen, and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift – membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter – to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Elizabeth was a [...] "behind the scenes force" [...] in ending apartheid.|$|E

Now these gates had been rudely torn away from their sockets, the iron had been sold {{for the benefit of}} the ever-empty Treasury, and no one <b>cared</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> homeless, the starving, or the evil-doer found shelter under the porticoes of the houses, from whence wealthy or aristocratic owners had long since thought it wise to flee.|$|R

2500|$|A {{distinction}} is generally made between medical and non-medical care, care provided {{by people who}} are not medical professionals. The latter is much less likely to be covered by insurance or public funds. [...] In the US, 67% of the one million or so residents in assisted living facilities pay for care out of their own funds. The rest get help from family and friends and from state agencies. Medicare does not pay unless skilled-nursing care is needed and given in certified skilled nursing facilities or by a skilled nursing agency in the home. Assisted living facilities usually do not meet Medicare's requirements. However, Medicare does pay for some skilled <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> elderly person meets the requirements for the Medicare home health benefit.|$|E

Because she was overdubbing her vocals, Page's name would be listed on the Pop charts as a group name.

2500|$|The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 {{originally}} {{only allowed}} an occupier {{to exclude the}} common duty of <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> property is used for business purposes. Several organisations, including the National Farmers Union and the Country Land and Business Association, argued that this was forcing landowners to exclude people completely {{for fear of being}} sued, thus hindering educational and recreational purposes as well as business ones. In response to this, Section 2 of the Act amends the 1977 Act to say that [...] "breach of an obligation or duty towards a person obtaining access to the premises for recreational or educational purposes ... is not a business liability of the occupier unless granting that person such access for the purposes concerned falls within the business purposes of the occupier". This permits landowners to allow educational and recreational bodies access to their land without the risk of liability.|$|E
