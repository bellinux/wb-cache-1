5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is {{large quantities of}} intravenous fluids. Other treatments may include dialysis or hemofiltration in more severe cases. Once urine output is established sodium bicarbonate and mannitol are commonly used but they are poorly supported by the evidence. Outcomes are generally good if treated early. Complications may include high blood potassium, low blood calcium, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and <b>compartment</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Compartment</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a {{clinical}} diagnosis, i.e., no diagnostic test conclusively proves its presence or absence, but direct {{measurement of the}} pressure in a fascial compartment, {{and the difference between}} this pressure and the blood pressure, may be used to assess its severity. High pressures in the compartment and a small difference between compartment pressure and blood pressure indicate that the blood supply is likely to be insufficient, and that surgical intervention may be needed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Compartment</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is treated}} with surgery {{to relieve the}} {{pressure}} inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E

5|$|In humans, bites {{from this}} species can produce severe local and {{systemic}} symptoms. Based {{on the degree}} and type of local effect, bites {{can be divided into}} two symptomatic categories: those with little or no surface extravasation, and those with hemorrhages evident as ecchymosis, bleeding and swelling. In both cases there is severe pain and tenderness, but in the latter there is widespread superficial or deep necrosis and <b>compartment</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Serious bites cause limbs to become immovably flexed as a result of significant hemorrhage or coagulation in the affected muscles. Residual induration, however, is rare and usually these areas completely resolve.|$|E
5|$|The swollen, {{inflamed}} muscle may directly compress {{structures in}} the same fascial compartment, causing <b>compartment</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The swelling may also further compromise blood supply into the area. Finally, destroyed muscle cells release potassium ions, phosphate ions, the heme-containing protein myoglobin, the enzyme creatine kinase and uric acid (a breakdown product of purines from DNA) into the blood. Activation of the coagulation system may precipitate disseminated intravascular coagulation. High potassium levels may lead to potentially fatal disruptions in heart rhythm. Phosphate binds to calcium from the circulation, leading to low calcium levels in the blood.|$|E

40|$|Rhabdomyolysis {{can lead}} to fatal hyperkalaemia, acute renal failure and <b>compartment</b> <b>syndromes</b> in renal {{transplant}} patients. The most common cause for rhabdomyolysis in these patients is a drug interaction between statins and ciclosporin A [1].

Some argue that the safest statins for transplanted patients are those whose elimination is independent of the P 450 system, e. g. pravastatin. Flouroquinolones have become widely used anti-biotics.

50|$|The loss {{of fluid}} {{out of the}} {{capillaries}} has similar effects on the circulation as dehydration, slowing both the flow of oxygen delivered to tissues and organs {{as well as the}} output of urine. Urgent medical attention in this phase consists of fluid resuscitation efforts, mainly the intravenous administration of saline solution plus hetastarch or albumin and colloids (to increase the remaining blood flow to vital organs like the kidneys), as well as glucocorticoids (steroids like methylprednisolone, to reduce or stop the capillary leak). However, it is important to avoid overly aggressive intravenous fluid administration during this leak phase, because it may cause massive swelling of the extremities and thus serious collateral damage because of induced <b>compartment</b> <b>syndromes.</b>|$|R

Shallow breathing from pain can lead to lung collapse. Pancreatic enzymes may attack the lungs, causing inflammation.

500|$|Zakuani {{scored two}} goals {{and had two}} assists in his first six {{appearances}} of the 2011 season. On 22 April 2011, a harsh challenge by Brian Mullan led to Zakuani fracturing his tibia and fibula three minutes into {{a game against the}} Colorado Rapids. He was airlifted to hospital and underwent surgery the same day. During recovery, doctors feared that his leg would require amputation because of <b>compartment</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The concern was caused by a lack of blood flow that hurt the nerves connecting the area to his foot. Mullan initially defended the tackle, saying he would make the challenge again. He later apologized in the face of increasing scrutiny and received a 10-game suspension (matching the longest ban in MLS history to date) and a $5,000 fine. Nelson Rodriguez, an executive vice president of MLS, {{said in a statement that}} the disciplinary committee “felt the egregious nature” of Mullan’s foul justified the punishment. 'Mullan’s tackle is the type of play we need to eliminate from our game, and the level of discipline is consistent with our efforts to do so.' [...] Zakuani missed the remainder of the season, and this injury marked the beginning of the end of his career as a starter in pro soccer.

We wish to report our experience with an upper arm compartment syn-drome in a high school athlete. CASE REPORT A 17 -year-hold high school cornerback sustained a contusion to his right upper arm while making a tackle during a football game. He completed the game but presented to the emer-gency room 3 hours after the injury with an exquisitely painful, tensely swollen arm just above the volar crease at the elbow. The arm was held in partial flexion; passive extension intensified the pain. Motor and sensory neural function were intact. The brachial pulse could not be felt because of the swelling, and the radial pulse, although pres-ent, was noticeably weaker than the left radial pulse. Roentgenograms of the humerus, radius, and ulna were negative for fracture. An arteriogram was then obtained which showed no arterial injury, but the brachial artery was displaced by the massive amount of swelling (Fig. 1). Surgical exposure was obtained by a 10 cm longitudinal incision on the medial aspect of the upper arm. The biceps was markedly contused and edematous, an an epimysiotomy was performed. In addition, a substantial amount of blood was present in the anterior compartment of the arm between the biceps and triceps. The blood was evacuated with obvious immediate relief of the compartment turgidity. No active bleeding sites were identified and there was no reaccumu-lation of blood. Three days later, the skin was closed and the patient was able to resume his athletic activities a few weeks later. Figure 1.
