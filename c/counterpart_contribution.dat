The technique allows the computation of the broad band circuital response of arbitrarily shaped cavity filters. The coaxial excitation {{of this kind of}} filters is rigorously modeled by taking into account the high order modes on the coaxial aperture. A singular decomposition algebraic procedure has been implemented in order to obtain the solenoidal and non-solenoidal <b>counterparts</b> <b>contributions</b> of the electric current density inside the cavity needed by the BI-RME formulation.

40|$|Background : Research on {{fertility}} differentials between {{eastern and}} western Germany after German reuniﬁcation in 1990 {{has focused on the}} fertility of women. Trends in the fertility of men are rarely studied due to data constraints and methodological challenges. Objective : This paper aims to close this gap by analyzing fertility differentials between {{eastern and western}} German males over the period 1991 - 2013. We consider different approaches to estimate male fertility and investigate variation in fertility trends, levels, and timing. Methods : We use German birth register data to estimate age-speciﬁc fertility rates and total fertility rates. As the paternal age is unknown for a non-negligible proportion of births, we compare imputation techniques and conduct sensitivity analyses. For the population at risk we employ adjusted numbers that attempt to account for the overcount in the population of childbearing age in the 1990 s and the 2000 s. Results : The trends and differences in the fertility of eastern and western German men are roughly similar to those observed among women. However, male fertility levels are lower, and male and female fertility vary in terms of timing. The total fertility rate of eastern German males in 1994 of 0. 74 is likely to represent a record low. Whereas the fertility levels of eastern German women recently surpassed those of western German women, the fertility levels of eastern German men are still lower than those of their western German <b>counterparts.</b> <b>Contribution</b> : We compare methods to estimate male fertility trends...|$|R

The static and dynamic scattering properties of polystyrene-latex samples {{and of a}} critical sample of the system 3 -methyl-pyridine/water/NaBr were investigated. The scattering experiments were performed using a 3 D-cross-correlation setup. Samples of high to low transmissions were investigated. In highly turbid samples multiply scattered light contributes to the scattering intensities and correlation functions. An evaluation using traditional light scattering theory, valid for transparent samples and single scattering, leads to erroneous results. Therefore it was reasonable to precisely estimate the contribution of multiply scattered light to the scattering intensities and the correlation functions. The {{first part of this}} work describes light scattering experiments of latex samples. The detector deficiencies were determined by evaluating the dependence of the amplitudes of the auto correlation functions of the polarized scattered light on the countrates. Thus it was possible to convert the experimental countrates and correlation functions into their ideal <b>counterparts.</b> The <b>contributions</b> of single and multiple scattering to the scattering intensities were calculated from the amplitudes of the 3 D-cross-correlation functions.

Whether a similar form of pre-patterning exists in mammals is currently under hot debate in mice. This study investigated this issue {{for the first time}} in ovine as a large mammal model. Microsurgical trisection of unfertilized MII-oocytes revealed that cortical cytoplasm around spindle (S) contained significant amounts of total maternal mRNAs and proteins compared to matched cytoplast hemispheres that were located either near (NS) or far (FS) -to-spindle. RT-qPCR provided striking examples of maternal mRNA localized to subcellular substructures S (NPM 2, GMNN, H 19, PCAF, DNMT 3 A, DNMT 1, and STELLA), NS (SOX 2, NANOG, POU 5 F 1, and TET 1), and FS (GCN) of MII oocyte. Immunoblotting revealed that specific maternal proteins DNMT 3 A and NANOG were asymmetrically enriched in MII-spindle-half of the oocytes. Topological analysis of sperm entry point (SEP) revealed that sperm preferentially entered via the MII-spindle-half of the oocytes. Even though, the topological position of first cleavage plane with regard to SEP was quite stochastic. Spatial comparison of lipid content revealed symmetrical distribution of lipids between 2 -cell blastomeres.

Questionnaires were completed by 1559 middle-school adolescents from north-eastern France including various risk factors, SI, SA, and their first occurrence over adolescent’s life course (except SI). Data were analyzed using logistic regression models for SI and Cox regression models for SA (retaining only school, behavior, and health-related difficulties that started before SA). Immigrant adolescents had a two-time higher risk of SI and SA than their native counterparts. Using nested models, the excess SI risk was highly explained by socioeconomic factors (27 %) and additional school, behavior, and health-related difficulties (24 %) but remained significant. The excess SA risk was more highly explained by these issues (40 % and 85 %, respectively) and became non-significant. These findings demonstrate the risk patterns of SI and SA and the prominent confounding roles of socioeconomic factors and school, behavior, and health-related difficulties. They may be provided to policy makers, schools, carers, and various organizations interested in immigrant, adolescent, and suicide-behavior problems...|$|R
40|$|Summary Possible {{causes of}} the genetic erosion that occurs during the {{fragmented}} phases of the tree-improvement delivery system are reviewed. The impacts of intentional and uninten-tional directional selection during phenotypic selection, seed production (with its associated reproductive-phenology asyn-chrony, fecundity differential and varying propensity to in-breeding), seed processing and storage, and seedling production are evaluated. In general, genetic diversity and heterozygosity parameters of seed orchards are higher or simi-lar to those observed in their natural-population <b>counterparts.</b> However, parental <b>contribution</b> to the resultant seed orchard seed crops is consistently asymmetrical, {{and this is a}} major cause of genetic erosion. In most cases, less than 20 % of an orchard’s clones contribute 80 % of the cone crop, thus reducing the effective population size. Because seed germination of coniferous tree species is under strong maternal genetic con-trol, the combined effects of differences in reproductive output and germination, as well as of management practices (e. g., simulated long-term storage of seed showed that loss of viabil-ity during storage is genotype specific), cause unintentional directional selection during seedling production. This review confirms the need for genetic monitoring of each phase of the tree-improvement delivery system, so that practical solutions can be developed to alleviate genetic erosion...|$|R
