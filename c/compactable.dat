It is more commonly seen {{in the south of}} England and at National Trust properties. The material is aesthetically suited to older properties and is lower maintenance than gravel alone since it does not need regular raking. Once laid, the surface is somewhat permeable to water and therefore does not easily hold puddles or generate rapid surface runoff. The material is increasingly being used at domestic properties as a low cost and environmentally friendly alternative to concrete and block paving in paths and driveways.|$|E
50|$|People use net {{for many}} {{different}} occupations. Netting {{is one of}} the key components to fishing in mass quantities. This textile is used because of its sturdy yet flexible origin, which can carry weight yet, still be lightweight and <b>compactable.</b> Fisherman use netting when trawling, because it is sturdy enough to carry large amounts of weight as fish are trapped, pulled, then lifted out of water. Oftentimes, the filaments that make up the yarn are coated with wax or plastic. This coating adds a waterproof component to the textile that provides even more reliability. Net is also used in medical practices to provide fabric insulation and wrapping under an industry standard sling. In the medical practice, netting provides cushion and protection, when used in layers, but still allows the skin to breathe under the fabric. Depending on what the netting is being used for, a different wax or plastic coating can be applied in order to cover the filaments that use up the yarn. Filaments can be made from synthetic or natural fibres, but that is all up to the manufacturer when deciphering what the textiles future entails. When netting is going to be exposed to water or heat often, manufacturers consider that and apply what best fits that textile.|$|E

Dentritic and cubic sodium chloride were chosen as plastically deforming, dicalcium phosphcte and sugar as fragmentary and styrocell, homopolymer and copolyrinier as non-compactable materials. The uniaxial compaction of the materials was continuously followed by measurement. of 1 -. h e applied force, the force transmitted radially to the die wall and the upper punch displacement. The data obtained was presented {{in the form of}} Mohr circles, stress pathways (shear-mean compaction stress planes) and a three dimensional representation in mean compaction stress, shear stress and volume change.

The unloading stress profiles were however more informative. All unloading shear-mean compaction stres's curves of the <b>compactable</b> materials cross the mean compaction stress axis to give negative values of shear stress and reach a minimum value of T min' which was material and compaction p.,- essure dependent.

40|$|Numerical {{models were}} used to {{investigate}} the effects of differential compaction on strain development and early fracturing in an early cemented high-relief Triassic carbonate platform prograding onto basinal sediments, whose thickness increases basinward. Results show that basinal sediment compaction induces stretching of internal platform and slope strata in prograding platforms. When sediments are early cemented, such extensional strain is accommodated by the generation of syndepositional fractures. The amount of stretching is predicted to increase from the oldest to the youngest layers, due to the thickening of the <b>compactable</b> basinal sequences towards the external parts of the platform. Stretching is also controlled by {{the characteristics of the}} basin: the thicker and the more <b>compactable</b> the basinal sediments, the larger will be the stretching. Numerical modelling has been applied to the LadinianEarly Carnian carbonate platform of the Esino Limestone (Central Southern Alps of Italy). This case study is favourable for numerical modelling, as it is well exposed and both its internal geometry (inner platform, reef and prograding clinostratified slope deposits) and the relationship with the adjacent basin can be fully reconstructed, as the Alpine tectonic overprint is weak in the study area. Evidence for early fracturing (fractures filled by fibrous cements coeval with the platform development) is described and the location, orientation and width of the fractures measured. The fractures are mainly steeply dipping and oriented perpendicularly to the direction of progradation of the platform, mimicking local platform-margin trends. The integration of numerical models with field data gives the opportunity to quantify the extension triggered by differential compaction and predict the possible distribution of early fractures in carbonate platforms of known geometry and thickness, whereas the interpretation of early fractures as the effects of differential compaction can be supported or rejected by the comparison with the results of ad hoc numerical modelling...|$|E

Changes in the oxidation state of Fe in the constituent clays of compacted clay barriers may degrade the hydraulic conductivity of these structures because other properties related to hydraulic onductivity, such as swelling, gel microstructure, and particle size, are greatly altered by the oxidation state.

This study is intended to assist in consistently assessing MSWI bottom ash compaction by means of the Proctor method. This test is routinely applied to address unbound road materials and suggests two methods. Compaction parameters show a marked procedural dependency due to the particle morphology and weak particle strength of ash. Re-compacting a single batch sample to determine Proctor curves is a common practise that turns out to overvalue optimum moisture contents and maximum dry densities.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the stress field can vary with depth, even within a {{homogeneous}} tectonic setting, as documented for the active Mirandola fault-related fold along the buried front of the northern Apennines. Analyses of borehole breakouts and other well data, integrated with seismological information and field evidence, show that extension perpendicular to the fold axis, above approximately 1200 m, changes to a strike-slip stress field and finally to compression near the main detachment at depth. Similar along-depth strain variations recognized in non-active anticlines are usually explained by invoking tangential longitudinal strain folding (i. e., stretching above and shortening below a neutral surface) or gravitational instabilities. However, in this study, we propose that differential compaction may play a significant and generally overlooked role. With the aid of numerical modeling, it is shown that where fold limbs are onlapped by highly <b>compactable</b> deposits (as in the Mirandola area), differential compaction induces stretching at shallow (< 1 - 2 km) depths. The amount of stretching {{is a function of}} the shape of the fold and of the thickness of the syn-tectonic sediments.

40|$|Knowledge of {{the stress}} {{sensitivity}} of elastic-wave velocities in sedimentary rocks with different consolidation is important for several geophysical applications such as seismic pore pressure prediction, time-lapse seismic analysis and not least in seismic exploration. Since clays or shales are more <b>compactable</b> than sand or sandstones they often experience large plastic deformation causing both clay platelet orientation and porosity reduction {{of the order of}} 50 % or more. The interplay between stress and porosity effects may mask the stress sensitivity of velocities in clays or shales. The porosity loss occurring in sandstones during mechanical compaction is generally slower and hence the stressinduced velocity changes are better preserved at least prior to the onset of grain cementation. Small amounts of contact cement, 1 to 2 % of the total rock volume, can have a dramatic effect on velocities and their corresponding stress dependence. We demonstrate this reduction in stress sensitivity of elastic-wave velocity between sandstones of different consolidation through comparison of rock physics contact model-predictions of compressional to shear velocity ratio (V p /V s), with similar estimates obtained from time-lapse seismic amplitude versus offset (AVO) data from two oil producing fields. Furthermore, modified contact models are proposed to investigate the role of the combined effects of intergrain contact friction, increasing differential stress and stress ratio in relation to the propagation direction of the elasticwaves in granular media. Model-predictions are compared with ultrasonic measurements obtained from experimental compression tests on unconsolidated sands.

This is based upon DNA and amino acids-based structure to the core of the ciphering process. In the proposed scheme we have three phases.

This technique can be done on any type of data and for applying this technique we have to convert the data into binary form. And to get the original information decrypt it by reversing the process.

The petroleum industry is currently involved in efforts to revegetate and remediate the tailings sand. One approach used is revegetation of the reclamation sites with Frankia-inoculated alders. Alders are primary succession trees that have the ability to grow in nutrient poor and waterlogged environments, in part because they form a symbiotic relationship with the nitrogen-fixing Actinobacteria, Frankia.

The effect of Frankia-inoculated alders on soil quality was evaluated by monitoring the chemical and microbiological characteristics of the soil. The impact on the indigenous microbial community was also studied using hydrocarbon mineralization assays, and molecular approaches, such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Plant parameters (biomass, nitrogen content) were measured to evaluate the impact of Frankia on alder health and growth.

The liquid loading factors for such liquid vehicles were calculated to obtain the optimum amounts of carrier and coating materials necessary to produce acceptable flowing and compactible powder admixtures viable to produce compacts. The ratio of carrier to coating material was kept constant in all formulations at 20 to 1. The formulated liquisolid tablets were evaluated for post compaction parameters such as weight variation, hardness, drug content uniformity, percentage friability and disintegration time. The in-vitro release characteristics of the drug from tablets formulated by direct compression (as reference) and liquisolid technique, were studied in two different dissolution media. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier- Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) were performed. The results showed that all formulations exhibited higher percentage of drug dissolved in water (pH 6. 4 – 6. 6) compared to that at acidic medium (pH 1. 2).

Data was compiled for these four generators from 1988 to the present for analyses. Prior waste minimization efforts have focused on identifying waste stream processes and performing source materials substitutions or reductions where applicable. In this historical survey, the generators surveyed included an accelerator facility, the plutonium facility, a chemistry and metallurgy research facility, and a radiochemistry research facility. Of particular interest in waste minimization efforts was the composition of suspect low level waste in which no radioactivity is detected through initial survey. Ultimately, this waste is disposed of in the LANL low level permitted waste disposal pits (thus filling a scarce and expensive resource with sanitary waste). Detailed analyses of the waste streams from these 4 facilities, have revealed that suspect low level waste comprises approximately 50 % of the low level waste by volume and 47 % by weight. However, there are significant differences in suspect waste density when one considers the radioactive contamination. For the 2 facilities that deal primarily with beta emitting activation and spallation products (the radiochemistry and accelerator facilities), the suspect waste is much lower density than all low level waste coming from those facilities. For the 2 facilities that perform research on transuranics (the chemistry and metallurgy research and plutonium facilities), suspect waste is higher in density than all the low level waste from those facilities.

ODTs were mechanically robust, however this limited disintegration to within 3 mins, with mannitol fragmentation being a major limitation. Polymeric film coating was devised as a potential technique to enhance ODT mechanical properties. Due to high attrition during fluidisation a novel stationary coating technique was developed as a proof of concept. ODTs coated in this way, coupled with a postcoating curing step, demonstrated an increase in hardness of almost double and essentially zero friability. This novel coating technique could prove hugely beneficial in the formulation of high dose or poorly <b>compactable</b> drugs. The application of ODTs for FDCs was tested with four model drugs: amlodipine (5 mg), atorvastatin (10 mg), isoniazid (50 mg) and rifampicin (75 mg). ODT formulations for single and FDCs showed rapid disintegration and good mechanical properties. Comparison of single and FDC dissolution profiles was performed using FDA recommended f 1 and f 2 testing. Bioavailability from ODTs was assessed using in vitro Caco- 2 permeability and dissolution data and in silico physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling. Bioequivalence was demonstrated between single and FDC for each drug in both fed and fasted states, whilst atorvastatin showed a positive food effect (enhanced peak plasma concentration and area under the curve), due to reduced metabolism by CYP 3 A 4...|$|E
40|$|Coatings {{are very}} {{important}} in pharmaceutical formulation for taste masking, drug protection, and drug release modification. Most film coatings are applied using polymer solutions {{but the use of}} organic solvents implies some disadvantages, like solvent exposure, solvent disposal and product contamination by residual. Furthermore, such solvents are flammable and toxic for operators and their use cannot be considered pollution-free. Although the use of water as a coating-solvent eliminates many of these disadvantages, it could lead to other problems like processing time increase and long-term stability issues for some products. Among the various solventless processes, compression coating retains some importance, for example to delay or to control drug release, to associate incompatible drugs in the fixed dose combination, to target two drugs in different areas of the gastrointestinal tract, to obtain a pulsatile time-dependent release and to incorporate poorly <b>compactable</b> materials in the core. This coating procedure has been shaded by the difficulty to develop a manufacturing process able to localize the core {{in the center of the}} coated tablet. In the last years different manufacturing methods have been proposed to overcome this inconvenient. In particular a one-step dry-coating tablet manufacturing method implemented by Ozeky et al. is noteworthy for producing thinner coatings. Recently we have developed a thermal procedure to obtain, from a direct compression (DC) tablet containing a cross-linked polycarboxylic acid and a cellulose derivative, a bioadhesive matrix able to control the drug release. The mechanism controlling drug release is based on the formation of a non-erodible water-swellable matrix, whose behaviour can be modulated on the basis of thermal procedure and excipient composition. The unique features of this procedure make it also applicable to the manufacturing of coated tablets. Here we illustrate the preliminary experimental evidence gathered using this matrix in compression-coated tablets...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMicrofiltration (0, 1 μm) {{was used}} to {{fractionate}} casein (d 50, 3 = 180 nm) micelles from whey proteins (2 - 6 nm). The casein fraction forms a deposited layer on the membrane surface. Little {{is known about the}} structure of these layers and how transmembrane pressure affects their structure. In order to assess the properties, casein micelle deposits were characterized by dead-end microfiltrations. Casein micelle deposits of constant composition were formed following a standardized layer build up (permeate mass, pressure, pH). Then protein free milk serum was filtered through the deposit. Thus, the impact of compressive forces and protein-protein interactions on physical cake properties during constant solid height filtrations could be determined by stepwise variations of transmembrane pressure and pH without further deposition of proteins. It was found that the casein micelle deposits became more <b>compactable,</b> when their surface charge was lower. Specific cake properties were related to hydrophilic repulsion between casein micelles, whereas the influence of electrostatic interactions between micelles was negligible. The observed cake material properties obtained from dead-end filtrations provide valuable insights into deposit layer build-up and structure. Results obtained for dead-end filtrations were used to describe cross-flow filtrations. For this purpose a new method was developed to assess the specific cake resistances by the evaluation of the kinetic of flux decrease due to deposit layer build-up at the start of filtrations. For the first time it could be shown that deposits consisting of casein micelles during cross-flow filtration were thin layers (1 - 3 μm), resulting in high specific resistances (up to 20 • 10 - 15 m/kg). The specific cake resistance was pressure dependent and increased when the hydrophilic repulsion between casein micelles was reduced at a pH beyond the isoelectric point...|$|E
40|$|The {{introductory}} {{chapter of}} this doctoral thesis {{provides an overview}} of the salient properties of pharmaceutical excipients, chitin, metal silicates and sugar alcohols in order to give a scientific background/context to the research subject matter reported in subsequent chapter of the thesis. When chitin is used in pharmaceutical formulations processing of chitin with metal silicates is advantageous, from both an industrial and pharmaceutical perspective, compared to processing using silicon dioxide. Unlike the use of acidic and basic reagents for the industrial preparation of chitin-silica particles, co-precipitation of metal silicates is dependent upon a simple replacement reaction between sodium silicate and metal chlorides. When co-precipitated onto chitin particles, aluminum, magnesium, or calcium silicates result in non-hygroscopic, highly <b>compactable,</b> and disintegrable compacts. Disintegration and hardness parameters for co-processed chitin compacts were investigated and found to be independent of the particle size. Capillary action appears to be the major contributor to both water uptake and the driving force for disintegration of compacts. The good compaction and compression properties exhibited by the chitin–metal silicates were found to be strongly dependent upon the type of metal silicate co-precipitated onto chitin. In addition, the inherent binding and disintegration abilities of chitin–metal silicates are useful in pharmaceutical applications when poorly compressible and/or highly non-polar drugs need to be formulated. The influence of the lubricant magnesium stearate (MgSt) on the powder and tablet properties of chitin-Mg silicate co-precipitate was examined and compared with lubricated Avicel® 200 and Avicel-Mg silicate co-precipitate. Crushing strength and disintegration-time studies were conducted in order to evaluate tablet properties at different compression pressures. Lubrication of chitin-Mg silicate powder with MgSt was evaluated using a high speed rotary tablet press. The compactability and disintegration time of chitin-Mg silicate are unaffected by the possible deleterious action of up to 2...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{conceptual}} explorations in {{the design}} of modular smart health care facilities have been sought for. A new approach towards the modular design of distantly connected built environments has been introduced that can serve {{to improve the quality of}} health care services. The results of this research led to developing a new concept for an engineering product that can have diverse use cases. The proposed healthcare unit concept can be used as a single patient room in hospitals or in patient’s home and can create a <b>compactable,</b> clean, sanitized, customized, and relaxing space for patients or for the elderly who need special care, making it possible to monitor their status and vital signals remotely and helping to reduce infection rates in hospitals. The user requirements for the product, the product design and development methods, manufacturing methods, and management and lifecycle issues were considered during the concept design. In the course of design, while many established product development and engineering design methodologies were used, new engineering design methodologies were also developed for measuring resource effectiveness of the design solutions. The newly developed measures can be utilized in a variety of design practices. The validity of the newly introduced methodologies was checked with the designed product as a case study and with the help of workshops and other case studies. This thesis can be looked into as a sample of a systematic design decision making for designing buildings and structures and the results of such a design can be a revolutionary view towards connected modular facilities. Engineering design principles such as Structure Sharing, Affordance, Prototyping, Design Engineering, QFD Analysis, Modularization, etc. and design and manufacturing technologies such as Direct Digital Manufacturing(DDM), 3 D Printing, CNC Laser Cutting, CAD and 3 D Modeling, MCAD and Simulations, Rendering and Visualizations, Virtual Reality (VR), etc. were reviewed and utilized in the course of this Master’s thesis...|$|E
40|$|Most {{departments}} of transportation, including Indiana, currently use the Superpave mixture design method to design asphalt mixtures. This method specifies that the optimum asphalt content {{for a given}} gradation be selected at 4 percent air voids. During construction, these mixtures are typically compacted to 7 - 8 percent air voids. If mixtures were designed to be more <b>compactable</b> in the field they could be compacted to the same density as the laboratory mixture design, which would increase pavement durability by decreasing the in-place air voids. The objective {{of this research was}} to optimize the asphalt mixture design in order to increase in-place asphalt pavement durability without sacrificing the permanent deformation characteristics of the mixture. Three asphalt mixtures were designed using the standard Superpave design method at 100 gyrations of the Superpave Gyratory Compactor, suitable for traffic levels of 3 to 30 million Equivalent Single Axle Loads. Each mixture was then used as a starting point to design three additional mixtures using 70, 50, and 30 gyrations, with optimum binder content chosen at 5 percent air voids, rather than the currently specified 4 percent. The effective asphalt content was held constant for the original and redesigned mixtures. Permanent deformation characteristics of the sets of four mixtures were determined by measuring the dynamic modulus and flow number. The results suggest that the mixture designs produced using 70, 50, and 30 gyrations had permanent deformation characteristics equal to or better than the original 100 -gyration mixtures. Based on the laboratory test results, two field trials were placed evaluate the design method, ease of construction and to compare the construction results of the re-designed and original mixtures. Samples from both projects were collected during construction, test specimens compacted, and additional physical testing completed. The field trial results suggest {{that it is possible to}} place a mixture at 5 percent air voids and that mixtures designed at 5 percent air voids should have equivalent performance to those designed at the conventional 4 percent air voids...|$|E
40|$|Anatomical breast {{density is}} an {{independent}} risk factor for breast cancer, where women with larger amounts of dense fibroglandular tissue (FGT) {{are more likely to}} develop breast cancer. Clinical models that consider personal information about a woman (age, family history, and genetics) to predict her risk for breast cancer can help her customize their own screening options or consider preventative measures. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to quantitatively measure the FGT volume, its high-cost makes it impractical to implement. Optical methods provide an appealing alternative, where the systems are low-cost and easily <b>compactable,</b> which makes clinical implementation easier. Optical tomography can spatially resolve and measure the concentration of relevant chromophores within the breast: water, lipid, oxy and deoxyhemoglobin. We have investigated the use of structured-light diffuse optical tomography (SL-DOT) in imaging the breast volume. In SL-DOT, spatially modulated light is illuminated and collected from the breast through the use of two digital micro-mirror devices (DMDs). Through both simulations and phantom studies, we found that SL-DOT is suitable for predicting the percentage of FGT when taking into consideration both the volume segmented from the chromophore maps and the recovered chromophore concentrations. A second independent risk factor in which we are interested is the functional breast density. After intravenous injection of a MRI contrast agent, the intensity of the FGT is enhanced to varying degrees among patients, referred to as background parenchymal enhancement (BPE). It has been shown that BPE is also correlated with breast cancer incidence, most likely due to the higher perfusion of nutrients in blood to the FGT. Because BPE is an indication of blood flow, we believe the hemoglobin content measured from SL-DOT will be correlated to the BPE seen in MRI; therefore, our technique can potentially measure two independent risk factors for breast cancer. Once clinically translated, SL-DOT can be used to measure both the anatomical and functional breast density inexpensively and quickly, allowing women to make informed decisions about their breast cancer screening...|$|E
