40|$|The <b>creaseability</b> test {{according}} to DIN 55 437 is - {{on account of}} its standardized visual method - not suitable {{for the evaluation of}} the technical quality of creasings. This was demonstrated in tests with twelve different carton boards. Qualitative indications are given by the force/deformation-diagramm during the erecting. Curves not too flat and not to steep and a hardly perceptible curve bend for the moment of the ply separation indicate a technically satisfactory creasing. Quantitative indications are given by the stiffness ratio. According to the investigations made in the past, it can be expected that MD-creasings with values from 0, 2 to 0, 6 and CD-creasings with values from 0, 1 to 0, 4 meet the technical requirements for the opening of the folding carton during machine-packaging as well as the optical requirements {{according to}} DIN 55 437. Definitive details concerning the limiting values in relation to practice can only be obtained by machine tests...|$|E
