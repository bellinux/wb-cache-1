40|$|Introduction The {{emergence}} of evidenced-based medicine (EBM) {{has led to}} an ever-increasing plethora of guidelines to follow in order to best deliver this high standard of care. Compliance with such guidelines remains sub-optimal and novel methods of guideline dissemination have become popular. Two patient safety areas of major morbidity and, potentially, mortality for patients are venous thromboembolism (VTE) and sepsis. Prophylaxis is available to minimise risk of VTE and early resuscitation bundles for sepsis, such as Sepsis Six have become widely promoted. Both of these areas have local guidelines that should be followed but compliance is poor. At the start of this period of research Sepsis Six had not yet been rolled-out in the surgical department at the RAH, Paisley. This provided a golden opportunity to look at guideline dissemination for one area, using a variety of modalities. Smartphone technology has become ubiquitous in the past few years. The reasons for this are examined and the role for smartphones, and their applications (apps) in delivering assistance to doctors involved in front-line care is discussed. Potential regulatory issues are reviewed. Aims The aims of this thesis are: To assess prevalence of smartphones in the doctor population in a three-site hospital board area and these doctors’ attitudes to smartphone technology for clinical uses. To design and implement novel apps for thromboprophylaxis and Sepsis Six as a supplemental modality for guideline dissemination. To assess the impact of the introduction of these apps on guideline compliance, including assessing for fatiguing of interest. Materials and Methods A SurveyMonkey questionnaire was emailed to all 456 doctors across the three hospitals in the GGC Clyde sector asking about smartphone ownership and usage and their views on the roles of apps for clinical care. Native smartphone apps were designed and developed for both iPhone and android platforms for both VTE prophylaxis and Sepsis Six. Once these had been field-tested, and pre-app audit of current guideline <b>compliance</b> <b>undertaken</b> they were manually deployed to the surgical junior doctors at the Royal Alexandra Hospital, Paisley. Concurrently, while the Sepsis Six app was being developed the concept of Sepsis Six was rolled out using standard posters, presentations and tutorials. After each modality introduction for both VTE prophylaxis and Sepsis Six audit was undertaken both early, and some time later, to try and assess possible fatiguing of interest and compliance. Results There was a good response to the survey, revealing very high smartphone ownership levels at virtually 90...|$|R
40|$|This study * {{of joint}} capsular <b>compliance</b> was <b>undertaken</b> {{in an attempt}} to assess objectively the effect of {{rheumatoid}} arthritis on the integrity of the joint capsule and associated ligaments. Joint instability and subluxation in progressive rheumatoid disease may result from damage to these structures through granulomatous invasion and distension by intra-articular effusion. Alteration in the compliance of the joint capsule and associated ligaments might be important as being early evidence of significant tissue damage. Changes in the properties ofjoint tissues which can be related to joint symptoms are of theoretical importance. Urayama (1956) investigated the relationship between pressure and volume after saline was injected into the knee joints of 162 patients and normal volunteers. He found significant differences between normaljoints and thosejoints with symptoms arising from injury or disease.

40|$|The {{management}} of risk within {{a nursing home}} environment is widely viewed as an undertaking perfom 1 ed by the owners or managers of nursing homes. The residents of these homes are reliant upon the owners and managers to keep them safe, {{due in part to}} a traditional belief that they are the experts and have a greater understanding of risk. To establish risk it is first a requirement to have an understanding of levels of risk and risk management techniques. Risk appreciation is often influenced by heuristic representativeness, as well as social and cultural influences.

40|$|The {{residents}} of aged care nursing homes are reliant upon {{the owners and}} managers for their safety. However, there are issues that support fire and life safety non-compliance, such as government funding of nursing homes linked with self assessed assurance. In addition, most aged nursing homes are facility managed by on-site care personnel as a secondary role, emergency agencies no longer complete scheduled audits, auditing by government funding agencies is restricted, and fire and life safety are not considered {{by the majority of}} residents or visitors. The higher level of risk within a nursing home environment is due to the demographic of the residents. Such increase in risk places a greater importance on risk mitigation systems, with fire and smoke doors being a pivotal component. The study measured fire and smoke door maintenance <b>compliance</b> by <b>undertaking</b> a statistical random audit of 160 doors in 22 nursing homes in Western Australia, demonstrating a non-compliance level of 87 % on the audited doors with a total of 935 failures identified.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{an urgent}} need to develop prehospital {{research}} capability {{in order to improve}} the care of patients presenting to emergency medical services (EMS). The Prehospital Randomised Assessment of a Mechanical compression Device In Cardiac arrest trial, a pragmatic cluster randomised trial evaluating the LUCAS- 2 device, represents the largest randomised controlled trial conducted by UK ambulance services to date. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify and analyse factors that may influence paramedic attitudes to, and participation in, clinical trials. METHODS: Personal and organisational experience from this trial was assessed by feedback from a workshop attended by collaborators from participating EMS and a survey of EMS personnel participating in the trial. A work systems model was used to explain the impact of five interwoven themes-person, organisation, tasks, tools & technology and environment-on trial conduct including gathering of high-quality data. RESULTS: The challenge of training a geographically diverse EMS workforce required development of multiple educational solutions. In order to operationalise the trial protocol, internal organisational relationships were perceived as essential. Staff perceptions of the normalisation of participation and ownership of the trial influenced protocol <b>compliance</b> rates. <b>Undertaking</b> research was considered less burdensome when additional tasks were minimised and more difficult when equipment was unavailable. The prehospital environment presents practical challenges for undertaking clinical trials, but our experience suggests these are not insurmountable and should not preclude conducting high-quality research in this setting. CONCLUSIONS: Application of a human factors model to the implementation of a clinical trial protocol has improved understanding of the work system, which can inform the future conduct of clinical trials and foster a research culture within UK ambulance services.

40|$|This report, {{prepared}} by the Secretariat of the OECD {{was the basis for}} a peer review examination of Chinese Taipei at the OECD’s Global Forum on Competition on 9 February, 2006. Competition law in Chinese Taipei has been an important element of the program of economic reforms that moved the economy from centrally directed emphasis on manufacturing and exports to a market-driven emphasis on services and high technology. The competition law follows mainstream practice about restrictive agreements, monopolies and anticompetitive mergers, with a particularly clear statutory basis for concentrating enforcement attention on horizontal collusion. The rules about market deception and unfair practices connect the competition law to consumer interests. There is a risk, though, that rules based on a cultural tradition of fairness might lead to interventions to correct differences in bargaining power, which could dampen competition rather than promote it. The competition enforcement agency, the Fair Trade Commission (FTC), is now a stable, experienced administrative agency. It followed an appropriate sequence in introducing competition policy, emphasising transparency and guidance to encourage <b>compliance</b> before <b>undertaking</b> stronger enforcement measures. General reforms are in process that would clarify the independence of the FTC. To improve enforcement against hard-core cartels, a leniency programme should be adopted, and the special treatment for agreements among small businesses should be limited. Some other aspects of the enforcement tool-kit should be revised, such as the cap on fines and the use of market share as a merger notification test. The most visible regulatory reforms to promote competition have been in telecoms, although an independent regulator for that sector is just now being set up. The government retains holdings in privatised firms that could have implications for market competition, so FTC vigilance about the risk of cross-subsidy or other distortion remains warranted. ...|$|R
40|$|Study Design: Cross-sectional case-control study. Objectives: To {{identify}} {{risk factors}} and clinical presentation of individuals with cervical arterial dissection. Background: Cervical arterial dissection is a common cause of stroke in young people and has in rare cases been associated with cervical manipulative therapy. The mechanism is considered to involve pre-existing arterial susceptibility and a precipitating event, such as minor trauma. Identification of individuals at risk or early recognition of a dissection in progress could help expedite medical intervention and avoid inappropriate treatment. Methods: Participants were individuals 55 {{years of age or}} younger from the Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia with radiologically confirmed vertebral or internal carotid artery dissection and an age- and sex-matched comparison group. Participants were interviewed about risk factors, preceding events, and clinical features of their stroke. Physical examination of joint mobility and soft tissue <b>compliance</b> was <b>undertaken.</b> Results: Twenty-four participants with cervical arterial dissection and 21 matched comparisons with ischemic stroke but not dissection were included in the study. Seventeen (71 %) of the 24 participants with dissection reported a recent history of minor mechanical neck trauma or strain, with 4 of these 17 reporting recent neck manipulative therapy treatment. Cardiovascular risk factors were uncommon, with the exception of diagnosed migraine. Among the participants with dissection, 67 % reported transient ischemic features in the month prior to their admission for dissection. Conclusion: Recent minor mechanical trauma or strain to the head or neck appears to be associated with cervical arterial dissection. General cardiovascular risk factors, with the exception of migraine, were not important risk factors for dissection in this cohort. Preceding transient neurological symptoms appear to occur commonly and may assist in the identification of this serious pathology...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of social {{compliance}} audits in the supply chain of multinational companies (MNCs). Particularly, we explore {{the use of}} such audits in assessing and managing the working conditions of factory workers in the garment industry in a developing nation. Through a range of interviews with MNCs’ internal auditors, with commissioned external auditors and with representatives of the suppliers in Bangladesh, this study finds that social compliance audits become ritual strategies and are not a primary means of advancing workers’ rights. Drawing on the concept of surrogate accountability, the study suggests that to create real change in workers’ conditions and in order to hold MNCs and their suppliers accountable, some form of surrogate (government, NGOs or media) intervention is necessary. This is, we argue, preferable to leaving it in the hands of ‘markets’ and simply waiting for another major incident such as Rana Plaza to stir public concern.

He was disappointed, however, in them all. The blindness continued unchanged. At last, however, he found the wife of a peasant, whose bathing produced the effect. The monarch's sight was suddenly restored. The king rewarded the peasant woman, whose virtuous character was established by this indisputable test, with the highest honors. The others he collected together, and then shut them up in one of his towns. When they were all thus safely imprisoned, he set the town on fire, and burned them all up together.|$|R

Municipal solid waste (MSW), chemical waste and clinical waste incinerators, cement kilns, sinter plants and sewage sludge incinerators were the source categories monitored and reported here. Based on this monitoring programme, the previous national UK emission estimates by Eduljee and Dyke (1) of 560 – 1100 g I-TEQ a− 1 for 1993 have been revised downwards to 220 – 660 g I-TEQ a− 1. Despite source reduction measures, MSW incinerators remain a significant source of PCDD/Fs to the atmosphere, contributing between 30 – 50 % of the ΣPCDD/F I-TEQ emission, rather than the 80 % they were estimated to contribute in 1993. 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted PCDD/F congener profile data are presented for some of the source categories and generally support the view that differences in the mixtures (‘fingerprints’) of PCDD/Fs emitted from different sources are observed. New data on the dioxin-like PCB emissions are presented for cement kilns and sinter plants. These show that TEQ-rated PCBs can make an important contribution to the I-TEQ emitted from certain combustion sources.

The Commissioner of Taxation outlined that in 2002 - 03 approximately $ 3. 8 billion flowed from Australia to tax havens.

40|$|Federal {{and state}} {{contracting}} authorities more frequently are including Most Favored Customer (MFC) clauses in contracts for procurement of privately manufactured products. These clauses seek {{to ensure that}} the contracting authority (typically a federal or state agency) receives at least as favorable pricing as other customers making similar purchases. For example, the government agency may request that the contractor warrant that the prices it charges under the contract will be as favorable as those offered to other parties purchasing similar products of similar quantity under similar terms and conditions. In theory, the request to be treated equally to others making similar purchases is reasonable. In practice, however, it is challenging to satisfy MFC clauses because they often contain ambiguous comparative terms that make MFC <b>compliance</b> an onerous <b>undertaking.</b> Specifically, in a world of complex products and services, it often is difficult—if not impossible—to identify “similar” products sold pursuant to “similar” terms and conditions. Making compliance even more challenging are those MFC clauses that do not define the subset of purchasers (basis of award customers) who are to be compared for purposes of determining whether a price adjustment is necessary to satisfy the contractor’s MFC obligations. Some MFC clauses are not limited to any subset of purchasers, effectively requiring the contractor to search all U. S. -based sales to ensure compliance with the clause.

40|$|Compliance {{mechanisms}} can {{be found}} in treaties regulating such diverse issues as human rights, disarmament law, and environmental law. In this bibliography, the focus will be on compliance mechanisms of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs). Compliance with norms of international environmental law, in particular those included in MEAs, has been of interest for many years, both from a theoretical and practical point of view. Compliance with MEAs is a matter that differs greatly from compliance with domestic environmental rules. In relation to compliance with the norms of environmental agreements, the focus of this article is on sovereign countries. There are a number of theories that attempt to address the complex issues involved in the legal basis of compliance as well as the best methods to ensure it, ranging from facilitative to compulsory techniques. The theory of compliance comprises the debate on the extent of functions of the organs established by MEAs (such as the compliance committees Conference of the Parties [COPs] and/or Meeting of the Parties [MOPs]). There are already a great number of diverse compliance procedures attached to various MEAs, such as in the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (see United Nations Environment Programme 2000],cited under Montreal Protocol) and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (see United Nations 1998, cited under Kyoto Protocol). It should be kept in mind that MEAs and noncompliance procedures do not exist in a normative vacuum. Compliance theories are linked with general international law; for instance, in terms of the question of the use of countermeasures in compliance control and material breach of treaties. Even nonbinding norms may have a role in promoting <b>compliance</b> with obligations <b>undertaken</b> under MEAs. In practice, environmental compliance and the gradual evolution of compliance procedures in international environmental law is one of most vibrant and stimulating subject matters in international law and is still evolving...|$|R

Furthermore, a true constitutional democracy emphasises and advocates the notion of service leadership that nurtures public participation and engages with citizens in a positive manner. Ethical conduct in the public sector earns public trust; it is hence a key principle in good governance. Yet, in the years since the advent of democracy in South Africa, the government has been plagued by rampant corruption and maladministration by public officials and politicians in leadership positions. The external control measures passed by government in an attempt to ensure ethicality and accountability within the public sector include codes of ethics, rules of conduct and the enactment of legislation. These are intended to shape the mindset of members of the public sector, with the ultimate aim of an efficient, effective, ethical and responsive public service. The purpose of the current study is to analyse non-compliance with external control measures within the public sector by means of selected case studies and to present the reasons for this occurrence. The three cases selected are: the South African Arms Deal, the corruption trial of Jackie Selebi, and the investigation of Bheki Cele regarding irregularities in the procurement of SAPS assets, the latter two who served as National Commissioners of the South African Police Service but were each dismissed from that post. The reasons for non-compliance with external control measures in the public sector as well as recommendations based on the findings to improve <b>compliance</b> will be <b>undertaken.</b> The three case studies demonstrate the experience and impact of corruption and/or maladministration, which have contributed to the increasing loss of confidence in political leadership in the country as elsewhere in the world. A qualitative methodology of inquiry, including a review of literature covering the theories applied to the case studies will be employed. Owing to the subject nature of the current study, the findings will be validated by an independent source, which has been identified as the Office of the Public Protector...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} issues of market design for emissions trading schemes by focusing on penalty designs and initial allocation mechanisms. Penalty design is {{defined in terms of}} penalty types and levels and the allocation mechanism compare free allocation with auctioning. The first essay employs a theoretical model to examine compliance incentives and market efficiency under three penalty types: the fixed-penalty rate (FPR), the make-good provision (MGP), and the mixed penalty design. Using a simple two-period model of firm&# 146;s profit maximisation, we analyse compliance decisions and the efficient penalty level under each penalty type. Our findings indicate that the penalty type does not affect compliance decisions provided that the efficient penalty level is applied. Market efficiency is retained regardless of penalty types. These findings are used as the hypotheses for the second essay. The behavioural implications of penalty designs on market performance are investigated in the second essay using an experimental method. Three penalty types and two penalty levels are enforced in a laboratory permit market with auctioning wherein subjects make <b>compliance</b> decisions by <b>undertaking</b> irreversible abatement investment decisions or by buying permits. In contrast to theory, we find that penalty levels serve as a focal point that indicates compliance costs and affects compliance strategies. The MGP penalty provides stronger compliance incentives than the other penalty types. Most importantly, a trade-off between investment incentives and efficiency is observed. Using a laboratory experiment, the third essay studies how the initial distribution of permits through free allocation or auctioning, may affect price discovery, allocative and static efficiency under the presence of three penalty designs. Price discovery is not influenced by the initial allocation mechanism. Permit prices remain above the efficient level due to the presence of irrational bidding and trading behaviour as well as risk aversion. Uncertainty regarding permit prices results in a modest allocative efficiency as over-investment prevails. Auctioning evidently generates higher static efficiency due to stronger price signals. This result supports the majority of literature which argues for auctioning. An appropriate auction design is crucial to avoid the risk of overbidding which will inflate the auction price and diminish efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Civil society {{participation}} {{has become}} a buzzword in {{the debate about the}} legitimacy and accountability of international governance. Many organizations, prominently among them the World Trade Organization (WTO), have come under considerable pressure to open up their policy-making process towards non-state actors. Although the WTO has become more transparent in recent years, direct stakeholder access to its policy making is still denied. This situation is often contrasted with that at the United Nations (UN), where there is (allegedly) much more formally regulated and more substantial participation of civil society. In this paper, we compare the patterns of participation in these two organizations and seek to identify some common dynamics. We present a general framework for analysis based on a model of the policy cycle that allows us to distinguish ‘push’ and ‘pull’ factors that determine cooperation in different phases of policy making. In our empirical study, we find that in the WTO, there are few incentives for the organization itself to pull civil society actors into its policy-making process. Agendasetting is the task of governments; research and analysis is delivered by the Secretariat; <b>compliance</b> control is <b>undertaken</b> jointly by the organization and its members. To push the door to trade policy making open, civil society can only rely on public shaming, that is, threatening to undermine the organization’s legitimacy as it violates widely accepted standards of good governance. In the UN system, there is in fact more cooperation, but it remains largely limited to the policy phases of agenda-setting, research and analysis and compliance control. Quite like the WTO, the UN protects an intergovernmental core of policy making in which cooperation with civil society remains at the discretion of state parties. Evidence for this are informal and ad hoc ways of collaboration and a lack of participatory rights for non-state actors in the Security Council and the General Assembly. We conclude that studying civil society participation in international public organizations through the lens of the policy cycle can give us a fine-grained picture of cooperative arrangements and enables us to identify potentials for cooperation as well as exclusion. Yet, we also observed two other factors at work that were not really grasped by the model of the policy cycle. First, the institutional culture of organizations can be more or less amenable to civil society. Second, organizations are susceptible to campaigns for ‘good governance’ that invoke standards of due process and may open the door to nonstate actors...|$|R
40|$|This audit {{assessed}} the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service 2 ̆ 7 s {{administration of the}} Tariff Concession System. Audit objective and criteria The objective of the audit {{was to assess the}} Australian Customs and Border Protection Service 2 ̆ 7 s administration of the Tariff Concession System. To form a conclusion against the objective, the audit adopted the following high-level criteria: 	an appropriate governance framework to support the effective operation of the system was established; 	a consistent, accountable and transparent assessment process for TCO applications has been implemented; 	processes and systems for the ongoing management, review and eventual revocation of TCOs are effective; and 	the approach to managing compliance with TCO requirements was sound. Overall conclusion Imposing duty on certain imported goods is designed to influence the flow of trade by regulating their value to protect Australia’s local economy and industry. In 2013 – 14, goods to the value of 338  billion were imported into Australia, with 9. 3  billion in customs duty collected. There are, however, a number of ways that importers can obtain duty-free entry of imported goods to Australia, including through accessing duty concession schemes, such as the Tariff Concession System (TCS). To receive a duty concession under the TCS, an imported good must be covered by a current Tariff Concession Order (TCO) made by Customs. A TCO consists of a tariff classification and text describing the good. As at October 2014, there were over 15   000 current TCOs available for use by importers. Under the TCS, around 1. 8  billion in revenue to the Commonwealth was forgone in 2013 – 14. Customs is responsible for administering the TCS, including assessing TCO applications, objections and revocations. In 2013 – 14, Customs received 941 applications for, and 133 objections to, TCO applications, made 770 TCOs, refused 79 TCOs and revoked 327 TCOs. Customs is also responsible for managing compliance with TCS requirements and providing assurance that importers applying a TCO to reduce customs duty are eligible to do so. The TCS is supported by mature administrative arrangements that provide a generally sound basis for the assessment and management of TCOs, including the processing of TCO applications, objections, revocations, as well as the management of TCOs that are in use. There are, however, aspects of Customs’ administrative arrangements that could be further improved, including by: 	developing a communications strategy for the TCS to maximise the effectiveness of communications and awareness raising activities, with a particular focus on local manufacturer engagement; and 	more clearly documenting TCO application assessment activities, in particular the basis on which applications are assessed as meeting legislative requirements, to provide greater assurance regarding the integrity of the assessment and decision-making process. Within the context of Customs’ broader compliance responsibilities, the limited resources assigned to TCS compliance are allocated on a risk basis and, overall, the small number of targeted <b>compliance</b> activities <b>undertaken</b> has identified TCO misuse. Nevertheless, Customs is not well placed to determine whether its activities directed at managing TCS compliance, including education and awareness activities through to enforcement action, are effectively addressing the risks arising from TCO misuse. This is primarily due to the: manner in which Customs collects and stores its compliance data, which makes it difficult to verify the number, scope and outcome of compliance activities; and absence of an appropriate set of performance measures against which an assessment of the effectiveness of compliance activities can be undertaken. To further improve Customs’ administration of the TCS and strengthen compliance monitoring arrangements, the ANAO has made three recommendations designed to: enhance engagement with key stakeholders; provide greater assurance regarding the assessment and decision-making process; and improve the monitoring and reporting of compliance activities...|$|R
40|$|Malaria is more {{prevalent}} {{today and the}} death toll is on the increase annually. It {{is one of the}} leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide and most of these deaths are in the poorest regions of the world. About 500 million cases are reported annually with more than 2 million deaths, and most are children. It is the major killer in the tropics and a major public health problem in developing countries and Papua New Guinea (PNG) is no exception. Resistant strains have been reported. This may be enhanced by inappropriate human behaviour in the use of anti-malarial drugs. Human factors include inappropriate prescribing and patient behaviour in using anti-malarial drugs. Despite the establishment of the standard treatment guidelines for malaria in PNG, three out of every four patients have chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria and malaria remains a major health problem. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of an education program on patients carers' understanding and effective use of anti-malarial drugs for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in children in general health clinics in PNG. The trial design involved a pre-post intervention study with a control group. The study was undertaken in the National Capital District. Papua New Guinea using one Clinic as the intervention site and another as the control site. The two clinics were similar in characteristics as confirmed in the study by demographic data where there were no significant differences observed. The data collection took placed over the period February to April 2002. It included observation of drug provision at study sites and interviews of patient carers on the first day at the clinic and a follow up seven days later. Three questionnaires were developed to evaluate the process and outcomes of malaria drug treatment in the above health facilities. Prescribing data were collected from prescriptions and patient carers' interviewed prior to the intervention program. Following the provision of drug information to patient carers. similar drug information and <b>compliance</b> questioning was <b>undertaken.</b> Differences in the pre-post elements of the study and in the control group over the study period were evaluated using Chi-Squared, Kruskal-Wallis, Fisher's Exact or Student's t-tests as appropriate. In excess of 100 patients in the pre- and in the post intervention phases were evaluated for their understanding and effective use of the anti-malarial drugs. In addition, 100 clients were in the control group at another clinic. Patients had attended the clinic up to 8 times in the previous year with a median of 2 visits. Amodiaquine, Fansidar, albendazole and paracetamol made up a total of 60 % of the drugs prescribed. The use of medicines was strongly supported with 94. 4 % indicating no problems with the medication. Only 3 % of patients received herbal or local remedies for malaria treatment. 1 n patients 10 years or less or their carers, it was found, there was a significant improvement in the carers understanding of the medications. There was a statistically significant improvement in patient outcomes from 57. 9 % to 92. 3 % reported as cured following the intervention program. The study has also identified low levels of appropriate administration of antibiotic suspensions in children by patient carers. For example, incorrect responses recorded for amoxycillin suspension were 80. 8 % (143). Septrim tablets 92 % (23), Septrim suspension 86 % (123), erythromycin suspension 100 % (26), and chloramphenicol suspension 84. 4 % (38). In this study the face to face (one-to-one) education program was used to influence patient carers understanding and effective use of drugs. The intervention program involved advising, informing, encouraging, and counselling the patient carers verbally on the appropriate and effective use of medicines. The verbal message was reinforced by a suitable label typed in English and Pidgin-English where instructions were clear, simple and unambiguous. The label was then attached to the envelopes or containers containing the drugs. On feedback, the information on the understanding and effective use of drugs was re-emphasized to the carers to reinforce their understanding for future references. Results showed that the intervention program made an impact in improved patient carers understanding and effective use of drugs and children's health outcomes. In conclusion, it is evident that a patient intervention program designed to improve the dosages and frequency of administration of anti-malarial drugs in PNG had no statistically significant outcome. This may be because the current level of understanding was quite high (> 70 %) and the study experienced a ceiling effect. However, as shown in the results, the patient carers understanding on the appropriate and effective use of drugs was lower during the pre-intervention and control group. When compared clinic-pre with clinic-post, there was a significant difference (P 0. 05) in the cured group. Therefore, the study identified an improvement in patient outcomes with respect to malaria. Hence. the simple intervention program in influencing patient carers understanding of the appropriate and effective use of medications led to a marked improvement in patient outcomes...|$|R
40|$|This report {{details the}} results of a NIOSH {{investigation}} on the ability of the Coal Dust Explosibility Meter (CDEM) to accurately predict the explosibility of samples of coal and rock dust mixtures collected from underground coal mines in the U. S. The CDEM, which gives instantaneous results in real time, represents a new way for miners and operators to assess the relative hazard of dust accumulations in their mines and the effectiveness of their rock dusting practices. The CDEM was developed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and successfully underwent national and international peer review. The intention of the device is to assist mine operators in complying with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) final rule 30 CFR* 75. 403, requiring that the incombustible content of combined coal dust, rock dust, and other dust be at least 80 % in underground areas of bituminous coal mines. As a final step towards commercialization of the CDEM, and to evaluate the performance of the device as a potential <b>compliance</b> tool, NIOSH <b>undertook</b> an extensive cooperative study with MSHA. This study, completed in 2009 - 2010, involved field use of the CDEM within MSHA's 10 bituminous coal districts. As part of their routine dust compliance surveys in these districts, MSHA inspectors collected sample coal and rock dust mixtures, field testing these samples for explosibility with the CDEM. Samples were then sent to the MSHA National Air and Dust Laboratory at Mt. Hope, WV, for parallel testing, first using a drying oven to determine the moisture followed by the traditional low temperature ashing (LTA) method. The LTA method determines explosibility of a coal and rock dust sample in a laboratory by heating the mixture to burn off the combustible material. The results, when combined with the moisture, are reported as total incombustible content (TIC). If the TIC is. 80 %, the sample is deemed to be nonexplosible and compliant with 30 CFR 75. 403. In the field component of this study, MSHA's use of the CDEM indicated that 30 % (175) of the 591 samples collected were explosible. NIOSH was able to obtain and remeasure 297 samples, and 97 % of those identified by the CDEM as being explosible (27 % of samples) or nonexplosible (73 % of samples) correlated with {{the results of}} the subsequent lab analysis using the LTA method. Of the remaining 3 % where there were differences between the field and laboratory methods, subsequent NIOSH evaluation attributed these differences to the variability (incomplete mixing, inadequate drying of the sample, the particle size of the rock dust and/or coal dust) of the samples being analyzed, the retained moisture in those samples, and the inherent ash in the coal. In considering these results and comparing the CDEM field measurements to the LTA laboratory measurements, {{it is important to understand}} the fundamental distinctions between the two methods. The determination of TIC by the LTA method is not itself a direct measure of explosibility, but a surrogate that calculates a single parameter associated with full-scale experimental results. This method is not based on particle size and treats all particles equally regardless of the size. In contrast, the CDEM utilizes a different approach, using optical reflectance to determine the ratio of rock dust to coal dust in a mixture, with full-scale experiments on flame propagation having already demonstrated the effects of varying the coal dust particle sizes and incombustible concentrations on the explosible vs. nonexplosible dust mixtures. A final important distinction between the two methods is that the CDEM offers real-time measurements of the explosion propagation hazard within a coal mine entry, allowing for immediate identification and mitigation of the problem, while the results from the traditional LTA method are not known for days or weeks after a sample is collected, allowing for the deficiency in rock dust to continue. The conclusions of this study strongly support the field use of the CDEM to measure the explosibility of coal and rock dust mixtures, to more effectively improve the onsite adequacy of rock dusting for explosion prevention. Mine operators could use the CDEM on a regular basis to ensure that their rock dusting practices are achieving inertization requirements and meeting the intent of 30 CFR 75. 403. MSHA inspectors could use the CDEM as a tool to immediately identify onsite explosibility hazards and initiate corrective action. A critical issue to both the LTA and the CDEM analysis methods is that the results are dependent on representative samples being collected for analysis.
