A {{reduction}} in <b>colour</b> contrast <b>sensitivity</b> in the tritan colour confusion axis, an early manifestation of blue cone photoreceptor injury by the high energy photons of the laser, has been demonstrated and has prompted a reappraisal of laser safety in ophthalmology. Argon laser is also frequently used in scientific research, often at higher power output and for longer periods than is used in clinical practice. The scientists operating these lasers are at risk of developing similar phototoxic retinal injury. METHODS [...] The <b>colour</b> contrast <b>sensitivity</b> of 18 scientists who regularly use short wavelength argon laser was investigated. RESULTS [...] Eye protection was infrequently used and individuals had been subjected to between 580 and 7200 hours of cumulative laser exposure during the course of their research.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to measure and evaluate colour vision in patients with HIV infection or AIDS. <b>Colour</b> contrast <b>sensitivity</b> tests were performed on 75 patients (150 eyes) in different stages of HIV infection. A highly sensitive computer graphics system was used to measure tritan, deutan, and protan colour contrast thresholds. Patients were classified into three clinical groups: (a) asymptomatic HIV infection, (b) lymphadenopathy syndrome or AIDS-related complex, and (c) AIDS. Overall, tritan (p < 0. 0001), deutan (p = 0. 003), and protan (p = 0. 009) <b>colour</b> contrast <b>sensitivities</b> were significantly impaired in patients with HIV infection compared with normal controls. Colour thresholds in patients with asymptomatic HIV infection (mean tritan threshold: 4. 33; deutan: 4. 41; protan: 3. 97) were not impaired compared with normal controls. Colour vision was slightly impaired in patients with lymphadenopathy syndrome or AIDS-related complex (tritan: 6. 25 (p < 0. 0001); deutan: 4. 99 (p = 0. 02); protan: 4. 45 (p = 0. 05)). In patients with AIDS the impairment was even more marked (tritan: 7. 66 (p < 0. 0001); deutan: 5. 15 (p < 0. 0009); protan: 4. 63 (p = 0. 004)). Analysis of covariance controlling for age demonstrated a close association between impairment of tritan <b>colour</b> contrast <b>sensitivity</b> and progression of HIV disease (p < 0. 0001). Following Köllner's rule, our study suggests that neuroretinal dysfunction occurs in patients with symptomatic HIV infection or AIDS. This is emphasised by the finding that the relative impairment in tritan vision compared with deutan/protan vision might reflect the difference in the number of cones or receptive fields.

John Joly independently reinvented the concept in 1894 and attempted to commercialise it, but the first successful product based on this idea, the Autochrome plate, did not reach the market until 1907. Several competing mosaic colour screen plate products soon appeared, including Louis Dufay's Dioptichrome plate, but the Autochrome plate remained by far the most popular. A film-based version of Autochrome was introduced in 1931, shortly before the first Dufaycolor product appeared.|$|E
50|$|Before digital chroma keying, bluescreening was {{accomplished}} using film. The camera colour negative was printed onto high-contrast {{black and white}} film, using either a filter or the <b>colour</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of {{the black and white}} film to limit it to the blue channel. Assuming this film was a negative it produced clear where the bluescreen was, black elsewhere, except it also produced clear for any white objects (since they also contained blue). Removing these spots could be done by a suitable double-exposure with the colour positive, and many other techniques. The end result was a clear background with an opaque shape of the subject in the middle. This is called a female matte, similar to an alpha matte in digital keying. Copying this film onto another high-contrast negative produced the opposite 'male matte'. The background negative was then packed with the female matte and exposed onto a final strip of film, then the camera negative was packed with the male matte was double-printed onto this same film. These two images combined together creates the final effect.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} detect flow is the most crucial aspect of an {{ultrasound}} (US) system because, if flow cannot be detected, no other aspect of performance matters. The objectives {{of this study were}} to validate a Doppler “sensitivity performance index,” a figure of merit, and to determine if it could be used to differentiate <b>colour</b> Doppler <b>sensitivity</b> performance in scanners of varying complexity. The sensitivity performance index was developed to give a combined measure of related aspects of sensitivity, such as the lowest detectable velocity, the vessel size and the penetration depth. The <b>colour</b> Doppler <b>sensitivity</b> was evaluated objectively as the lowest detectable velocity signal from the deepest achievable point within the Doppler sensitivity phantom free from extraneous noise in a small diameter vessel (3. 2 mm inner diameter). The effect of vessel size and mean velocity on the sensitivity performance index were investigated and {{it was found that the}} index was not proportional to vessel size, but this may be accounted for by considering the effect of the acoustic properties of the vessel material, the clutter filter and beam shape. The results obtained using flow phantoms with vessel sizes different from those used in this study are, therefore, not directly comparable to the results found in this study; however, a similar trend should be found in the results for the effect of control settings and a similar range of US scanners. It was found that the Doppler sensitivity performance index was a robust challenging test because none of the US scanners evaluated was capable of achieving the highest sensitivity performance index score, which would be limited by the lowest pump velocity and the deepest point of the vessel within the flow phantom. Therefore, this suggests that this method of determining Doppler sensitivity performance is valuable in the absence of other suitable methods, despite the fact that the relationship between the sensitivity performance index and vessel size is not proportional. Furthermore, use of the Doppler sensitivity performance index for the evaluation of a range of scanners demonstrated that curvilinear transducers have higher sensitivity performance indices than higher-frequency linear transducers, due to the higher achievable penetration depth. The effect of instrument settings was assessed for two transducers, the 4 C 3 curvilinear general-purpose transducer (Aspen) and the PVM 375 AT curvilinear general-purpose transducer (Nemio). The <b>colour</b> Doppler <b>sensitivity</b> performance was found to be significantly dependent on the clutter filter setting and the output power setting for both transducers tested.

50|$|The four spectrally {{distinct}} cone pigments {{are derived}} from the protein opsin, linked to a small molecule called retinal, which {{is closely related to}} vitamin A. When the pigment absorbs light the retinal changes shape and alters the membrane potential of the cone cell affecting neurons in the ganglia layer of the retina. Each neuron in the ganglion layer may process information from a number of photoreceptor cells, and may in turn trigger a nerve impulse to relay information along the optic nerve for further processing in specialised visual centres in the brain. The more intense a light, the more photons are absorbed by the visual pigments; the greater the excitation of each cone, and the brighter the light appears.By far the most abundant cone pigment in every bird species examined is the long-wavelength form of iodopsin, which absorbs at wavelengths near 570 nm.

Statistical significant difference was found between CSMO and NPDR eyes for protan colour contrast threshold (p = 0. 01). Statistical significance was found between CSMO and NPDR eyes for tritan colour contrast threshold (p = 0. 0002). Sensitivity and specificity for screening of CSMO using pass-fail criterion for age matched TCCT results achieved 71 % (95 % confidence interval: 53 – 85 %) and 70 % (95 % confidence interval: 60 – 78 %), respectively.
