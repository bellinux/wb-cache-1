40|$|A novel {{method for}} {{learning}} characteristic decision trees {{is applied to}} the problem of learning the decision mecha-nism of <b>coin-sorting</b> <b>machines.</b> Decision trees constructed by ID 3 -like algorithms are unable to detect instances of cat-egories not present in the set of training examples. Instead of being rejected, such instances are assigned to one of the classes actually present in the training set. To solve this problem the algorithm must learn characteristic, rather than discriminative, category descriptions. In addition, the abil-ity to control the degree of generalization is identified as an essential property of such algorithms. A novel method us-ing the information about the statistical distribution of the feature values that can be extracted from the training exam-ples is developed to meet these requirements. The central idea is to augment each leaf of the decision tree with a sub-tree that imposes further restrictions on the values of each feature in that leaf. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{start by}} making a {{distinction}} between mind and cognition, and by positing that cognition is an aspect of mind. We propose as a working hypothesis a Separability Hypothesis which posits that we can factor off an architecture for cognition from a more general architecture for mind, thus avoiding a number of philosophical objections {{that have been raised}} about the "Strong AI " hypothesis. We then discuss different positions that have been taken about how biological a theory of intelligence or cognition needs to be. Using a <b>coin-sorting</b> <b>machine</b> as an example, we discuss a range of positions on representations, and argue that for many purposes, the same body of matter can be interpreted as bearing different representational formalisms. We adopt the view that one way to understand the diversity of architectural theories is to make a distinction between deliberative and subdeliberative architectures. We propose that symbolic architectures, especially those based on logic or problem spaces, are essentially modeled on intuitions about deliberation, while connectionist and other architectures are inspired by phenomena that occur below deliberation. Much of the discussion and arguments in the field are not so much about "facts of the matter " as they are about analytic stances. Thus the search for an architectural level which will explain all the interesting phenomena of cognition is likely to be futile. There are a number of level...|$|R
