40|$|This paper applies Gestalt {{psychology}} and associative network theory {{to examine the}} effect of eclipsing in celebrity endorsement on consumer attitude towards the endorsed brand. Eclipsing occurs when the celebrity overshadows the endorsed brand by dominating in an advertisement and diminishing the associative link between the <b>celebrity</b> <b>and</b> endorsed brand. Three studies take into account match-up, celebrity attachment, brand familiarity, and the moderating role of eclipsing, through manipulating two levels of eclipsing in advertising: (1) high eclipsing, when the celebrity is the focus, and (2) low eclipsing, when both the <b>celebrity</b> <b>and</b> brand are emphasized. Consumers who have a weak attachment to the celebrity endorser report a more positive brand attitude when they see the <b>celebrity</b> <b>and</b> endorsed brand both emphasized in an advertisement (low eclipsing) than when the <b>celebrity</b> overshadows <b>and</b> dominates the brand (high eclipsing), irrespective of whether consumers perceive the <b>celebrity</b> <b>and</b> brand to match or mismatch. For consumers with strong celebrity attachment, high eclipsing enhances brand attitude, regardless of whether they perceive the <b>celebrity</b> <b>and</b> brand to either match or mismatch. The findings of these studies have significant implications for advertisers and brand managers in the execution of their advertisements featuring endorsements. 11 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of celebrity–charity {{co-branding}} fit on perceived celebrity philanthropy (celanthropy), attitude towards the <b>celebrity</b> <b>and</b> charity, as well as donation intention. We manipulate celebrity–charity functional fit through a 2 (celebrity: comedian vs athlete) [*]×[*] 2 (charity: comedy related vs sports related) factorial design whilst controlling for celebrity credibility (attractiveness, trustworthiness and expertise). Results show that a functional fit between the <b>celebrity</b> <b>and</b> charitable organisation encourages positive altruistic attributions in terms of perceptions of <b>celebrity</b> social responsibility, <b>and</b> egoistic attributions, with regards to <b>celebrity</b> <b>and</b> charity attitudes, and donation intention. Finally, results demonstrate that celebrity–charity fit (athlete (comedian) with sports related (comedy related) charity) can promote positive attitudes towards a <b>celebrity</b> <b>and</b> charity brand, as well as donation intention, with these relationships mediated by perceptions of celebrity social responsibility or philanthropy. Findings from this research are able to aid nonprofit organisations <b>and</b> <b>celebrity</b> brand managers {{in the creation of}} effective and persuasive co-branding alliance...|$|R

40|$|In this essay, David Andrews {{examines}} the intriguing nexus of <b>celebrity</b> <b>and</b> {{race in the}} context of mediated sport. As a suggestive, rather than comprehensive examination of the study of sport, <b>celebrity,</b> <b>and</b> race, the treatment attempts to illuminate the derivation, complexities, and absences within this field of intellectual inquiry. After a brief discussion of why the relationship between communication and sport matters in social and cultural terms, insight is given to the author’s engagement with celebrity- and race-focused research. This is followed by a brief overview of the <b>celebrity</b> <b>and</b> race research, highlighting its genesis, major themes, and foci. Paying particular attention to the U. S. -based studies, this discussion provides a rationale for the intensification of sport, <b>celebrity,</b> <b>and</b> race research in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, draws attention to studies representative of the major strands of inquiry, and highlights heretofore understudied areas. Finally, the prospects and directions for further inquiry on the nexus of <b>celebrity</b> <b>and</b> race {{in the context of}} mediated sport are briefly considered...|$|R

When the comic book was announced, many media outlets noted in their headlines that the new title was not a joke.|$|E
