25|$|CCT is {{required}} {{in order to ensure that}} folding takes place correctly. CCT is a group II cytosolic molecular chaperone (or <b>chaperonin,</b> a protein that assists in the folding of other macromolecular structures). CCT is formed of a double ring of eight different subunits (hetero-octameric) and it differs from other molecular chaperones, particularly from its homologue GroEL which is found in the Archaea, as it does not require a co-chaperone to act as a lid over the central catalytic cavity. Substrates bind to CCT through specific domains. It was initially thought that it only bound with actin and tubulin, although recent immunoprecipitation studies have shown that it interacts with a large number of polypeptides, which possibly function as substrates. It acts through ATP-dependent conformational changes that on occasion require several rounds of liberation and catalysis in order to complete a reaction.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{recognition}} sub-units {{are used}} for actin or tubulin although there is some overlap. In actin the subunits that bind with prefoldin are probably PFD3 and PFD4, which bind in two places one between residues 60-79 and the other between residues 170-198. The actin is recognized, loaded and delivered to the cytosolic <b>chaperonin</b> (CCT) in an open conformation by the inner end of prefoldin’s [...] "tentacles” (see the image and note). The contact when actin is delivered is so brief that a tertiary complex is not formed, immediately freeing the prefoldin.|$|E

40|$|AbstractType I <b>chaperonins</b> play an {{essential}} role in the folding of newly translated and stress-denatured proteins in eubacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Since their discovery, the bacterial <b>chaperonins</b> have provided an excellent model system for investigating the mechanism by which <b>chaperonins</b> mediate protein folding. Due to the high conservation of the primary sequence among Type I <b>chaperonins,</b> it is generally accepted that organellar <b>chaperonins</b> function similar to the bacterial ones. However, recent studies indicate that the chloroplast and mitochondrial <b>chaperonins</b> possess unique structural and functional properties that distinguish them from their bacterial homologs.

50|$|<b>Chaperonins</b> are {{a special}} class of chaperones that promote native state folding by {{cyclically}} encapsulating the peptide chain. <b>Chaperonins</b> {{are divided into}} two groups. Group 1 <b>chaperonins</b> are commonly found in bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria. Group 2 <b>chaperonins</b> are found in both the cytosol of eukaryotic cells {{as well as in}} archaea. Group 2 <b>chaperonins</b> also contain an additional helical component which acts as a lid for the cylindrical protein chamber, unlike Group 1 which instead relies on an extra cochaperone to act as a lid. All <b>chaperonins</b> exhibit two states (open and closed), between which they can cycle. This cycling process is important during the folding of an individual polypeptide chain as it helps to avoid undesired interactions as well as to prevent the peptide from entering into kinetically trapped states.|$|R
50|$|More {{information}} on the various types and mechanisms of a subset of chaperones that encapsulate their folding substrates (e.g. GroES) {{can be found in}} the article for <b>chaperonins.</b> <b>Chaperonins</b> are characterized by a stacked double-ring structure and are found in prokaryotes, in the cytosol of eukaryotes, and in mitochondria.|$|R
50|$|For example, the prefoldin {{that is used}} in the {{formation}} of actin also transfers α or β tubulin to a cytosolic <b>chaperonin.</b> The prefoldin, however, does not form a ternary complex with tubulin and <b>chaperonin.</b> Once the tubulins are in contact with the <b>chaperonin,</b> the prefoldin automatically lets go and leaves the active site, due to its high affinity for the <b>chaperonin</b> molecule. Once the prefoldin is in contact with the <b>chaperonin</b> protein, it loses its affinity for the unfolded target protein.|$|E

50|$|The exact {{mechanism}} by which chaperonins facilitate folding of substrate proteins is unknown. According to recent analyses by different experimental techniques, GroEL-bound substrate proteins populate an ensemble of compact and locally expanded states that lack stable tertiary interactions. A number of models of <b>chaperonin</b> action have been proposed, which generally focus on two (not mutually exclusive) roles of <b>chaperonin</b> interior: passive and active. Passive models treat the <b>chaperonin</b> cage as an inert form, exerting influence by reducing the conformational space accessible to a protein substrate or preventing intermolecular interactions e.g. by aggregation prevention. The active <b>chaperonin</b> role is in turn involved with specific chaperonin-substrate interactions that may be coupled to conformational rearrangements of the <b>chaperonin.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{pathogen}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis expresses two <b>chaperonins,</b> one (Cpn 60. 1) dispensable and one (Cpn 60. 2) essential.

We show here that the Cpn 60. 2 homologue from Mycobacterium smegmatis also fails to oligomerize under standard conditions. However, we also show that the Cpn 60. 2 proteins from both organisms can replace the essential groEL gene of Escherichia coli, and that they can function with E.  coli GroES cochaperonin, as well as with their cognate cochaperonin proteins, strongly implying that they form oligomers in vivo. We show that the Cpn 60. 1 proteins, but not the Cpn 60. 2 proteins, can complement for loss of the M.  smegmatis cpn 60. 1 gene. We investigated the oligomerization of the Cpn 60. 2 proteins using analytical ultracentrifugation and mass spectroscopy. Both form monomers under standard conditions, but they form higher order oligomers in the presence of kosmotropes and ADP or ATP. Under these conditions, their ATPase activity is significantly enhanced. We conclude that the essential mycobacterial <b>chaperonins,</b> while unstable compared to many other bacterial <b>chaperonins,</b> do act as oligomers in vivo, and that there has been specialization of function of the mycobacterial <b>chaperonins</b> following gene duplication...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{heuristic}} model for chaperonin-facilitated protein folding, the iterative annealing mechanism, based on theoretical descriptions of "rugged" conformational free energy landscapes for protein folding, and on experimental evidence that (i) folding proceeds by a nucleation mechanism whereby correct and incorrect nucleation lead to fast and slow folding kinetics, respectively, and (ii) <b>chaperonins</b> optimize the rate and yield of protein folding by an active ATP-dependent process. The <b>chaperonins</b> GroEL and GroES catalyze the folding of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase {{at a rate}} proportional to the GroEL concentration. Kinetically trapped folding-incompetent conformers of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase are converted to the native state in a reaction involving multiple rounds of quantized ATP hydrolysis by GroEL. We propose that <b>chaperonins</b> optimize protein folding by an iterative annealing mechanism; they repeatedly bind kinetically trapped conformers, randomly disrupt their structure, and release them in less folded states, allowing substrate proteins multiple opportunities to find pathways leading to the most thermodynamically stable state. By this mechanism, <b>chaperonins</b> greatly expand the range of environmental conditions in which folding to the native state is possible.

40|$|<b>Chaperonins</b> are double-ring protein {{assemblies}} with {{a central}} cavity that provides a sequestered environment for in vivo protein folding. Their reaction cycle is thought to consist of a nucleotide-regulated alternation between an open substrate-acceptor state and a closed folding-active state. The cavity of ATP-charged group I <b>chaperonins,</b> typified by Escherichia coil GroEL [1], is sealed off by a co-chaperonin, whereas group II <b>chaperonins</b> - the archaeal thermosome and eukaryotic TRIC/CCT [2] - possess a built in lid [3 - 5]. The mechanism of the lid's rearrangements requires clarification, as {{even in the absence}} of nucleotides, thermosomes of Thermoplama acidophilum appear open in vitrified ice [6] and dosed in crystals [4]. Here we analyze the conformation of the thermosome at each step of the ATPase cycle by small angle neutron scattering. The apo-chaperonin is open in solution, and ATP binding induces Its further expansion. Closure seems to occur during ATP hydrolysis and before phosphate release, and represents the rate limiting step of the cycle. The same closure can be triggered by the crystallization buffer. Thus, the allosteric regulation of group II <b>chaperonins</b> appears different from that of their group I counterparts. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. [References: 21...|$|R
