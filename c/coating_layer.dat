Both the hardness and abrasion-resistant characteristics of the coating originate from the high strength of aluminium oxide, yet the porous <b>coating</b> <b>layer</b> produced with conventional direct current anodizing procedures is within a 60-70 Rockwell hardness C range [...] which is comparable only to hardened carbon steel alloys, but considerably inferior to the hardness of natural and synthetic corundum.

The ceramic <b>coating</b> <b>layers</b> are comprised of SiO 2 nanoparticles and polyvinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene (PVdF-HFP) binders. In comparison to the dense structure of conventional nanocomposite <b>coating</b> <b>layers,</b> the ceramic <b>coating</b> <b>layers</b> are featured with close-packed SiO 2 nanoparticles, which affords a well-developed porous structure. i. e. highly connected interstitial voids formed between the nanoparticles.
