25|$|Tentative {{constraints}} are available, {{with the}} <b>current</b> <b>loss</b> mostly due to low gravity and solar wind aided by photolysis. The loss of Titan's early atmosphere {{can be estimated}} with the 14N–15N isotopic ratio, because the lighter 14N is preferentially lost from the upper atmosphere under photolysis and heating. Because Titan's original 14N–15N ratio is poorly constrained, the early atmosphere may have had more N2 by factors ranging from 1.5 to 100 with certainty only in the lower factor. Because N2 is the primary component (98%) of Titan's atmosphere, the isotopic ratio suggests {{that much of the}} atmosphere has been lost over geologic time. Nevertheless, atmospheric pressure on its surface remains nearly 1.5 times that of Earth as it began with a proportionally greater volatile budget than Earth or Mars. It is possible that most of the atmospheric loss was within 50million years of accretion, from a highly energetic escape of light atoms carrying away {{a large portion of the}} atmosphere (hydrodynamic blow off event). Such an event could be driven by heating and photolysis effects of the early Sun's higher output of X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) photons.|$|E
50|$|If {{the applied}} voltage is normal voltage then normal flux {{will be set}} up. Since iron loss is a {{function}} of applied voltage, normal iron loss will occur. Hence the iron loss is maximum at rated voltage. This maximum iron loss is measured using the wattmeter. Since the impedance of the series winding of the transformer is very small compared to that of the excitation branch, all of the input voltage is dropped across the excitation branch. Thus the wattmeter measures only the iron loss. This test only measures the combined iron losses consisting of the hysteresis loss and the eddy <b>current</b> <b>loss.</b> Although the hysteresis loss is less than the eddy <b>current</b> <b>loss,</b> it is not negligible. The two losses can be separated by driving the transformer from a variable frequency source since the hysteresis loss varies linearly with supply frequency and the eddy <b>current</b> <b>loss</b> varies with the square.|$|E

First, multi-scale homogenization {{is demonstrated by}} a multi-scale approach {{in the context of}} an electrostatic problem.

Two multi-scale approaches for the magnetic vector potential have been derived to simulate the eddy <b>current</b> <b>losses</b> of a laminated iron core in 2 D efficiently and accurately. A rather coarse finite element grid suffices to approximate the homogenized solution of laminated media accurately.

5000|$|According to astrobiologists Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee {{in their}} book The Life and Death of Planet Earth, the <b>current</b> <b>loss</b> rate is {{approximately}} one millimeter of ocean per million years, but this rate is gradually accelerating as the sun gets warmer, to perhaps as fast as one millimeter every 1000 years. Ward and Brownlee predict {{that there will be}} two variations of this future warming feedback: the [...] "moist greenhouse" [...] where water vapor dominates the troposphere while water vapor starts to accumulate in the stratosphere, and the [...] "runaway greenhouse" [...] where water vapor becomes a dominant component of the atmosphere that the Earth starts to undergo rapid warming that could send its surface temperature to over [...] as the atmosphere will be totally overwhelmed by water vapor, causing its entire surface to melt and killing all life, perhaps in about three billion years' time. Either way, the loss of oceans will inevitably turn the Earth into a primarily desert world with the only water left being a few evaporating ponds scattered near the poles, and huge salt flats around what was once the ocean floor, much like the Atacama Desert in Chile or Badwater Basin in Death Valley, where the last life may remain for a few billion more years. Ironically, because of this, in the former case the loss of oceans will actually save the last life instead of destroying it completely. However, complex life like plants and animals will be long extinct before this happens, as the loss of oceans will cause plate tectonics to come to halt; water is a lubricant for tectonic activity and the loss of all water will make the crust too hard and dry to be subducted, therefore causing the carbon cycle to cease altogether (there would be no more volcanoes to return CO2 [...] back into the atmosphere).|$|E

Many times electrokinetics remediation will be coupled with other remediation forms to handle site specific issues. At a Danish Wood Perseveration copper was a heavy metal that polluted the soil in two forms; ionic solution with different complexes within the soil or a crystal lattice of soil minerals. For this site soil pH was a parameter of great importance because of an increased amount of copper present as ionic solution. By creating active barriers or exchange membranes that prevent ions from traveling from the electrode compartment into the soil. The separation of the soil from the electrode is designed to deter the acidification of the cathode and the <b>current</b> <b>loss</b> as highly mobile ions pass from electrode site through the soil. [...] In 1995 at the Paducah site, in Kentucky, USA a new technique was developed for removing heavy metals from soils.

Admixtures like sorbents, catalytic reagents, buffering solutions, oxidizing agents in this system are applied through a vertical system with the anode near the bottom and the cathode near the top. [...] The orientation of vertical anode and cathode system make recycling of fluid and system treatment easier. The formation of the lasagna layers is due to fracturing in over-consolidated clays because of horizontal electrodes. Coupling of the horizontal electrodes with a vertical pressuring system make this method especially effective in removing contaminants from deeper layers of the soil. The first test of this process proved 98% effective of removing trichloroethylene from the Paducah site.|$|E
5000|$|Roughly speaking, at the {{distance}} of Saturn, solar insolation and solar wind flux are sufficiently low that elements and compounds that are volatile on the terrestrial planets tend to accumulate in all three phases. Titan's surface temperature is also quite low, about 94 K. [...] Consequently, the mass fractions of substances that can become atmospheric constituents are much larger on Titan than on Earth. In fact, current interpretations suggest that only about 50% of Titan's mass is silicates, with the rest consisting primarily of various H2O (water) ices and NH3·H2O (ammonia hydrates). NH3, {{which may be the}} original source of Titan's atmospheric N2 (dinitrogen), may constitute as much as 8% of the NH3·H2O mass. Titan is most likely differentiated into layers, where the liquid water layer beneath ice Ih may be rich in NH3. [...] Tentative constraints are available, with the <b>current</b> <b>loss</b> mostly due to low gravity and solar wind aided by photolysis. The loss of Titan's early atmosphere can be estimated with the 14N-15N isotopic ratio, because the lighter 14N is preferentially lost from the upper atmosphere under photolysis and heating. Because Titan's original 14N-15N ratio is poorly constrained, the early atmosphere may have had more N2 by factors ranging from 1.5 to 100 with certainty only in the lower factor. Because N2 is the primary component (98%) of Titan's atmosphere, the isotopic ratio suggests that much of the atmosphere has been lost over geologic time. Nevertheless, atmospheric pressure on its surface remains nearly 1.5 times that of Earth as it began with a proportionally greater volatile budget than Earth or Mars. It is possible that most of the atmospheric loss was within 50 million years of accretion, from a highly energetic escape of light atoms carrying away {{a large portion of the}} atmosphere (hydrodynamic blow off event).
