30|$|The {{finer grain}} of {{information}} is the CommitInfo, which represents each <b>commit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> topology. A <b>commit</b> is identified by a hash code (hash attribute) and refers to its parents (except for <b>the</b> first <b>commit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> repository, which {{does not have any}} parent). As each commit may not exist in all clones of the topology, we store the list of clones where each commit can be found (foundIn association end). We also store the committer, the commit message (shortMessage attribute), and whether the commits belong to tracked or non-tracked branches (tracked attribute).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we first}} {{demonstrate}} {{a gap between}} the se-curity of verifiably <b>committed</b> signatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two-party setting and the security of verifiably <b>committed</b> signatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> multi-party set-ting. We then extend the state-of-the-art security model of verifiably <b>committed</b> signatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two-party setting to that of multi-party setting. Since there exists trivial setup-driven solutions to multi-party verifiably committed signatures (e. g., two-signature based solutions, we propose solutions to the multi-party stand-alone verifiably <b>committed</b> signatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> setup-free model, and show that our implementation is provably secure under the joint assumption that the underlying Zhu’s sig-nature scheme is secure against adaptive chosen-message attack, Fujisaki-Okamoto’s commitment scheme is statistically hiding and computation-ally binding and Paillier’s encryption is semantically secure and one-way as well as the existence of collision-free one-way hash functions...|$|R

5|$|Bradley {{did much}} to {{advance the cause of}} blacks in Kentucky. He denounced racially {{motivated}} lynchings and demanded that county officials prosecute racial violence. He called a special legislative session in March 1897 to consider an anti-lynching bill that imposed penalties including a fine of up to $500 and removal from office for any peace officer who did not prevent a lynching or mob violence. It further empowered peace officers to recruit able-bodied men to help protect prisoners and fined them for failing to do so, if necessary. Despite the politically divided legislature, the bill quickly passed both houses of the General Assembly and Bradley signed it on May 11, 1897. In January 1898, Bradley accepted an invitation to speak before the Anti-Mob and Lynch Law Association in Springfield, Ohio. During Bradley's four-year term, twenty-five lynchings were <b>committed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state, down from fifty-six during the term of his predecessor.|$|E
5|$|Francis {{spends most}} of the season as the newly {{appointed}} Vice President of the United States. In early episodes Frank vanquishes reporters on the trail of a murder he <b>committed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous season. However, the drama soon shifts to tensions involving Frank, President Walker, the Chinese government, and the wealthy Raymond Tusk, eventually culminating in a bitter political war between Frank and Tusk. Frank's wife Claire publicly reveals that she was raped in college by a prominent general and pursues anti-rape legislation. The most significant new character is Jackie Sharp, Frank's successor as House Whip, who soon finds herself embroiled in Frank's plans. As the war between Frank and Tusk consumes the Presidency, things culminate in a scandal that leads to Walker resigning, Tusk being arrested, and Frank ascending to the Oval Office.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008, Croatia indicted Božidar Vučurevićthe {{mayor of}} Trebinje and Bosnian Serb leader in eastern Herzegovina {{at the time}} of the offensivefor attacks against the {{civilian}} population of Dubrovnik. Jokić confirmed that he received orders from both Strugar and Vučurević. On 4 April 2011, Vučurević was arrested in Serbia and Croatia requested his extradition. He was released on bail on 17 June. In September, the extradition request was approved but Vučurević left Serbia and returned to Trebinje, avoiding extradition. In 2009, Croatian authorities filed charges against ten JNA officers, including Cokić, Ružinovski, Strugar, Jokić, Zec and Kovačević. They were charged with war crimes <b>committed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area of Dubrovnik prior to or after 6 December 1991, which were not covered by the ICTY indictments. The charges were made after the ICTY supplied documents collected during its investigation. In 2012, Croatia indicted the commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion of the JNA 5th Motorized Brigade and charged him with arson for burning 90 houses, businesses and public buildings in Čilipi from 5 to 7 October 1991.|$|E

5|$|Instead of an {{immediate}} return to France, the Western Allies staged offensives in the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations, where British troops were already stationed. By mid-1943 {{the campaign in}} North Africa had been won. The Allies then launched the invasion of Sicily in July 1943, and subsequently invaded Italy in September the same year. By then, Soviet forces were on the offensive and had won a major victory at the Battle of Stalingrad. The decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion {{within the next year}} was taken at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943. Initial planning was constrained by the number of available landing craft, most of which were already <b>committed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean and Pacific. At the Tehran Conference in November 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill promised Stalin that they would open the long-delayed second front in May 1944.|$|E
5|$|Little Bee is {{detained}} {{and quickly}} deported back to Nigeria, where she believes {{she will be}} killed. Lawrence uses his Home Office connections to track Little Bee's deportation details, and Sarah and Charlie are able to accompany her back home.

During a trip to the same beach where they first encountered one another, soldiers arrive to take Little Bee away. Despite being captured, Little Bee is not dispirited, and instead is ultimately hopeful at the sight of Charlie playing happily with a group of Nigerian children.|$|E
5|$|On Monday, April 4, U.S. Attorney Garret S. Cannon {{took over}} the {{prosecution}} and moved that Jackalow {{be transferred to the}} U.S. Marshall in the Essex County Jail. Voorhies again objected to jurisdiction, arguing that if the alleged murder was <b>committed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Long Island Sound it could only be tried in New York. Vroom on the other hand held that a showing of probable cause had been made. Further, he argued that he had jurisdiction {{on the grounds that the}} murder was committed between the state of New York and the Norwalk Islands, and Jackalow's robbery had in any case continued until his arrival in Barnegat. Jackalow was remanded to Newark to await the decision of the grand jury.|$|E

5|$|Attendees at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943 {{took the}} {{decision}} to launch a cross-Channel invasion within the next year. Churchill favoured making the main Allied thrust into Germany from the Mediterranean theatre, but his American allies, who were providing {{the bulk of the}} men and equipment, over-ruled him. British Lieutenant-General Frederick E. Morgan was appointed Chief of Staff, Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC), to begin detailed planning. The initial plans were constrained by the number of available landing-craft, most of which were already <b>committed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean and in the Pacific. In part because of lessons learned in the Dieppe Raid of 19 August 1942, the Allies decided not to directly assault a heavily defended French seaport in their first landing. The failure at Dieppe also highlighted the need for adequate artillery and air support, particularly close air support, and specialised ships able to travel extremely close to shore. The short operating-range of British aircraft such as the Spitfire and Typhoon greatly limited the number of potential landing-sites, as comprehensive air-support depended upon having planes overhead for as long as possible. Morgan considered four sites for the landings: Brittany, the Cotentin Peninsula, Normandy, and the Pas de Calais. As Brittany and Cotentin are peninsulas, the Germans could have cut off the Allied advance at a relatively narrow isthmus, so these sites were rejected.|$|E
