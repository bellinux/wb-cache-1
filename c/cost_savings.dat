30|$|The {{cooperative}} {{techniques are}} used to fairly assign the <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> to {{each member of the}} coalition such that all the players (owners) might receive more than they could individually get on their own. The fair allocation is recognized according to the amount that is added by each member to a coalition. Thus, depending on the amount that each player adds to a coalition they receive a percent of <b>cost</b> <b>saving.</b> A number of sharing mechanisms of <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> are suggested based on the economic models including Shapley value, Core, the τ value and ECSM.|$|R

5|$|BAE Systems {{announced}} that, in December 2013, {{the company}} had test flown a Tornado equipped with parts that were made with 3D printing equipment. The parts included a protective cover for the radio, a landing-gear guard and air-intake door support struts. The test demonstrated the feasibility of making replacement parts quickly and cheaply at the air base hosting the Tornado. The company claimed that, {{with some of the}} parts costing less than £100 per piece to manufacture, 3D printing already resulted in savings of more than £300,000 and would offer further potential <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> of more than £1.2million through 2017.|$|E
5|$|Acting on {{recommendations}} from Beckham's commission, legislators helped offset the lost {{revenue from the}} sales tax by raising excise taxes; of particular import was the tax on whiskey, which {{was made possible by}} the repeal of Prohibition in 1935. Legislators also enacted the state's first income tax during the session. Chandler further proposed to achieve savings through the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1936. The bill realized significant <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> by restructuring the state government, reducing the number of boards and commissions in the executive branch from 133 to 22. Critics pointed out that the act also centralized more {{power in the hands of}} the governor and accused Chandler of ulterior motives in supporting it.|$|E

40|$|Hospitals {{are using}} more {{sophisticated}} and comprehensive management information systems to implement multiple strategic policies towards water <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> and water quality enhancement. However, they do not always achieve the intended strategic goals. This paper analyzes how managerial styles interact with sophisticated management information systems to achieve different water strategic priorities. How proactive vs. reactive managerial styles moderate the effects of management information systems on water <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> and water quality enhancement is analyzed. Relationships are explored using data collected from 122 general services directors in Spanish public hospitals. The findings show a positive effect of sophisticated management information systems on the achievement of water policies focused on <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> and quality enhancement. Results also show a different moderated effect of managerial styles; thus, sophisticated management information systems with a proactive managerial style facilitate managers to achieve better water quality policies rather than water <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> policies...|$|R

5|$|In 1948, GMAW was {{developed}} by the Battelle Memorial Institute. It used a smaller diameter electrode and a constant voltage power source developed by H. E. Kennedy. It offered a high deposition rate, but the high cost of inert gases limited its use to non-ferrous materials and prevented <b>cost</b> <b>savings.</b> In 1953, the use of carbon dioxide as a welding atmosphere {{was developed}}, and it quickly gained popularity in GMAW, since it made welding steel more economical. In 1958 and 1959, the short-arc variation of GMAW was released, which increased welding versatility and made the welding of thin materials possible while relying on smaller electrode wires and more advanced power supplies. It quickly became the most popular GMAW variation.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developing}} world, birth control increases economic growth due to there being fewer dependent children {{and thus more}} women participating in the workforce. Women's earnings, assets, body mass index, and their children's schooling and body mass index all improve with greater access to birth control. Family planning via the use of modern birth control {{is one of the}} most cost-effective health interventions. For every dollar spent, the United Nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved. These <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses. While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the MTO {{undertook}} an engineering review of the entire route in search of cost inefficiencies. Highways 416 and 407 were constructed during a recession in the mid-1990s. Highway407 became a tolled highway {{and for a time}} it was mentioned in legislative debates that Highway416 would also be tolled, but ultimately this never happened. Instead, a hiatus in construction allowed engineers to evaluate inefficiencies in bridge and cross-section designs, as well as sensitive clay soils near Ottawa. This initiative led to a <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> of over C$7 million and several of the unique design features located {{along the length of the}} freeway.|$|E
30|$|The {{traditional}} APP {{models have}} often been studied for analyzing the production planning of one production plant. This paper presented a new mathematical programming model for APP problems of multiple cooperating plants. We quantified the cost-saving opportunity of the cooperation of plants caused by decreases in inventory and workforce levels. It {{was found that the}} job security and satisfaction of workers can be dramatically raised because of plants’ cooperation. Several methods of CGT including Shapley value, τ-value, the least core and equal <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> methods were utilized for assignment of <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> to cooperating plants. We found that fair allocation of cooperation <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> can ensure the production plants satisfaction.|$|R

30|$|Once {{the total}} <b>cost,</b> <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> and synergy are {{computed}} for all coalitions {{of the production}} plants, the problem is addressing this question “how to distribute the <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> of the cooperation among different plants?” This {{is not a simple}} problem because {{it is not clear how}} much the contribution of each plant to the <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> of a coalition is. Thus, we require a theoretically grounded approach and the one most appropriate and well-known would be CGT (Reinhardt and Dada 2005; Bartholdi and Kemahlıoglu-Ziya 2005; Lozano et al. 2013; Asgari et al. 2013; Frisk et al. 2010; Hafezalkotob and Makui 2015; Mohammaditabar et al. 2016). For this purpose, some basic definitions and concepts related to CGT are briefly reviewed first; then, we will use these solution concepts in Co-APP. Even though several CGT solution concepts exist, we will focus here only on some of them including the Shapley value, the equal <b>cost</b> <b>saving</b> method (ECSM), the minmax core and the τ-value.|$|R
5|$|Many fixed-speed {{motor load}} {{applications}} that are supplied direct from AC line power can save energy {{when they are}} operated at variable speed by means of VFD. Such energy <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> are especially pronounced in variable-torque centrifugal fan and pump applications, where the load's torque and power vary with the square and cube, respectively, of the speed. This change gives a large power reduction compared to fixed-speed operation for a relatively small reduction in speed. For example, at 63% speed a motor load consumes only 25% of its full-speed power. This reduction is in accordance with affinity laws that define the relationship between various centrifugal load variables.|$|E
5|$|Meteorologists use the {{location}} {{of some of the}} jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting. The main commercial relevance of the jet streams is in air travel, as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against, which results in significant fuel and time <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> for airlines. Often, the airlines work to fly 'with' the jet stream for this reason. Dynamic North Atlantic Tracks are one example of how airlines and air traffic control work together to accommodate the jet stream and winds aloft that results in the maximum benefit for airlines and other users. Clear-air turbulence, a potential hazard to aircraft passenger safety, is often found in a jet stream's vicinity, but it does not create a substantial alteration on flight times. These are a narrow belt.|$|E
5|$|The Air Force's 1997 {{rejection}} of re-engining was subsequently disputed in a Defense Science Board (DSB) report in 2003. The DSB urged the Air Force to re-engine the aircraft without delay, saying {{doing so would}} not only create significant <b>cost</b> <b>savings,</b> but reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase aircraft range and endurance; these conclusions were {{in line with the}} conclusions of a separate Congress-funded study conducted in 2003. Criticizing the Air Force cost analysis, the DSB found that among other things, the Air Force failed to account for the cost of aerial refueling; the DSB estimated that refueling in the air cost $17.50 per gallon, whereas the Air Force had failed to account for the cost of fuel delivery and so had only priced fuel at $1.20 per gallon.|$|E

5|$|The ACA {{includes}} {{provisions to}} take effect between 2010 and 2020, although most took effect on January 1, 2014. Few areas of the US health care system were left untouched, making it the most sweeping health care reform since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. However, some areas were more affected than others. The individual insurance market was radically overhauled, {{and many of the}} law's regulations applied specifically to this market, while the structure of Medicare, Medicaid, and the employer market were largely retained. Most of the coverage gains were made through the expansion of Medicaid, and the biggest <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> were made in Medicare. Some regulations applied to the employer market, and the law also made delivery system changes that affected most of the health care system. Not all provisions took full effect. Some were made discretionary, some were deferred, and others were repealed before implementation.|$|E
5|$|Bob Ayling's {{leadership}} {{led to a}} <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> of £750m and {{the establishment}} of a budget airline, Go, in 1998. The next year, however, British Airways reported an 84% drop in profits in its first quarter alone, its worst in seven years. In March 2000, Ayling was removed from his position and British Airways announced Rod Eddington as his successor. That year, British Airways and KLM conducted talks on a potential merger, reaching a decision in July to file an official merger plan with the European Commission. The plan fell through in September 2000. British Asia Airways ceased operations in 2001 after BA suspended flights to Taipei. Go was sold to its management and the private equity firm 3i in June 2001. Eddington would make further workforce cuts due to reduced demand following 11 September attacks in 2001, and BA sold its stake in Qantas in September 2004. In 2005 Willie Walsh, managing director of Aer Lingus and a former pilot, became {{the chief executive officer of}} British Airways. BA unveiled its new subsidiary OpenSkies in January 2008, taking advantage of the liberalisation of transatlantic traffic rights between Europe and the United States. OpenSkies flies non-stop from Paris to New York's JFK and Newark airports.|$|E
5|$|Some sections, such as Metro, {{are only}} {{found in the}} editions of the paper {{distributed}} in the New York–New Jersey–Connecticut Tri-state area {{and not in the}} national or Washington, D.C. editions. Aside from a weekly roundup of reprints of editorial cartoons from other newspapers, The New York Times does not have its own staff editorial cartoonist, nor does it feature a comics page or Sunday comics section. In September 2008, The New York Times announced that it would be combining certain sections effective October 6, 2008, in editions printed in the New York metropolitan area. The changes folded the Metro Section into the main International / National news section and combined Sports and Business (except Saturday through Monday, when Sports is still printed as a standalone section). This change also included having the name of the Metro section be called New York outside of the Tri-State Area. The presses used by The New York Times allow four sections to be printed simultaneously; as the paper had included more than four sections all days except Saturday, the sections had to be printed separately in an early press run and collated together. The changes will allow The New York Times to print in four sections Monday through Wednesday, in addition to Saturday. The New York Times announcement stated that the number of news pages and employee positions will remain unchanged, with the paper realizing <b>cost</b> <b>savings</b> by cutting overtime expenses.|$|E
