A protein that is in cells, called TRIM21, can attach to the antibodies {{on the surface of}} the virus particle.

5|$|Acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid, {{and very}} little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell {{membrane}} in the acidic conditions of the stomach. The increased pH and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionised. Owing {{to the formation of}} concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and plasma concentrations <b>can</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.|$|E

Up to three additional human players can join in the single-player. Players initially choose between four teams, though 13 total are unlockable. Teams begin with four players with no alternates for substitution, and fight their way from fourth place in the Rookie Division to first place against each team in between. Players <b>can</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> take challenges within the division before irrevocably {{moving on to the next}} division.|$|E
5|$|Djungarian hamsters {{are common}} as pets in Europe and North America, and exhibit greater {{variance}} in their coats than {{those found in}} the wild. They reproduce often—more so than Syrian hamsters, and as they have no fixed breeding season, <b>can</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> produce large numbers of offspring all year round. Young pups act aggressively to one another, while breeding females may show similar aggression to males.|$|E
5|$|In {{adults and}} adolescents, {{hypothesized}} causes generally fall {{into one of}} either category: habit-induced, and trauma-induced. Habit-induced individuals generally have a history of bulimia nervosa or of intentional regurgitation (magicians and professional regurgitators, for example), which though initially self-induced, forms a subconscious habit that <b>can</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> manifest itself outside the control of the affected individual. Trauma-induced individuals describe an emotional or physical injury (such as recent surgery, psychological distress, concussions, deaths in the family, etc.), which preceded the onset of rumination, often by several months.|$|E

During his time in the Organization, Roxas develops a calm personality as a result of having no memories of a previous life, unlike other Nobodies.|$|E

In 2014 the airport served 7,629 passengers, 1,272 aircraft movements and handled 0.2 tonnes of cargo.

5|$|A further three CH-47Fs {{were ordered}} in December 2015 for $US150 million, {{including}} spare parts, related equipment and some support costs. The ADF {{had intended to}} expand the CH-47F fleet at a later date, but the order was placed at short notice to use an under-spend on other Defence capabilities. All three helicopters were delivered in June 2016, two and half months earlier than planned. During the year the CH-47s were also approved to operate from the Canberra class vessels after trials proved successful. The 2016 Defence White Paper and its supporting documentation stated that the CH-47Fs will receive modifications to better enable them to perform aeromedical evacuation tasks by the 2025–26 financial year, {{and that it is}} intended to regularly upgrade the helicopters so that they <b>can</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> be supported through the US military's logistics system.|$|E
5|$|Blackleg is a {{fungal disease}} of canola {{that results in}} major yield loss in {{affected}} crops. It overwinters on infected stubble (leftover crop residue) that is left on farm fields, and <b>can</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> produce spores, infecting future crops, until the stubble is buried or broken down completely. The observation that C.olla grows and fruits on canola stubble has led to research on the potential of this fungus to degrade canola stubble, and {{reduce the incidence of}} stubble-borne diseases like blackleg and blackspot. In a study of its lignin-degrading abilities, C.olla was shown to colonize canola, wheat, and barley residue, but appeared to have a preference for the woody taproots of canola as compared to the cereal residue.|$|E

There is also a function called Magical Academy Assist, in which NPCs named after members of the game's production team are summoned into battle to assist the cadets.|$|E

After initial research showed the blades did provide an advantage, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) changed their rules to ban the use of technical devices that provide an advantage and ruled him ineligible to compete. Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2008, meaning that he <b>can</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> run in non-disabled meets {{as long as he}} uses the equipment that was studied in the research.|$|E
5|$|Neverwinter Nights 2 {{went into}} {{development}} in July 2004. This sequel was designed with the Aurora Engine, also used by its predecessor, and the game's toolset {{was included in}} the game's release for players to use in designing their own adventures. The game's design team drew upon older role-playing video games, and decided that the player character would have to earn the respect of others by the things the character does. The game was also designed to be playable with other players online in a cooperative fashion. The game was released in October and November 2006. Official multiplayer support for the game was suspended in December 2012. In response, the Neverwinter Nights 2 community developed several initiatives by which players <b>can</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> play the game online.|$|E
