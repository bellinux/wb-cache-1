5|$|The <b>chachalacas,</b> guans and {{curassows}} are {{birds in}} the family Cracidae. These are large birds, similar in general appearance to turkeys. The guans and curassows live in trees, but the smaller <b>chachalacas</b> are found in more open scrubby habitats. They are generally dull-plumaged, but the curassows and some guans have colorful facial ornaments.|$|E

25|$|Vegetation on the {{limestone}} and other sedimentary soils ranges from lowland rainforest to grasslands to scrub brush in more arid areas. In forested areas, the trees include oaks, pines, white cedar, strawberry trees and oyamels. In the drier areas, {{there are also}} mesquite trees with some other desert plants including cactus. In the lowest elevations there are tropical hardwoods such as red cedar, Montezuma cypress and a tree called the “parota.” Wildlife mostly consists of birds and mammals such as doves, quails, <b>chachalacas,</b> eagles, roadrunners, and some waterfowl. Mammals include squirrels, rabbits, armadillos, white-tailed deer, foxes, coyotes, wild boar, pumas, raccoons, skunks, and opossums. There are some reptiles such as rattlesnakes and coral snakes.|$|E
5000|$|The plain <b>chachalaca</b> {{is related}} to the West Mexican <b>chachalaca</b> and the white-bellied <b>chachalaca,</b> and both of these were {{formerly}} considered a subspecies of the plain <b>chachalaca</b> [...] Today all major authorities recognize them as separate species.Their ranges slightly overlap in Mexico, but hybrids have not been reported between them. The white-bellied <b>chachalaca</b> may be more closely related to the little <b>chachalaca</b> than the plain <b>chachalaca.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{isolated}} {{population in}} Costa Rica {{is assigned to}} the nominate race of the plain <b>chachalaca,</b> but has also been assigned to the white-bellied <b>chachalaca</b> and may in fact represent a new subspecies of the plain <b>chachalaca</b> - its plumage is close to this species than the white-bellied.|$|R

2500|$|Nukak are expert hunters. The men hunt using blowguns, with darts {{coated with}} curare [...] "manyi", a poison made from {{different}} plants (curares). They specially hunt {{several species of}} monkeys (Alouatta spp., Cebus spp., Saimiri sp., Lagothrix spp., Ateles sp., Saguinus spp., Callicebus torquatus), and birds (Muscovy duck, <b>chachalacas,</b> guans, curassows, grey-winged trumpeter and toucans). Also they use javelins of Socratea exorrhiza palm wood to hunt two species of peccaries (Tayassu pecari and T. tajacu) and spectacled caimans, whose eggs they consume too. Nukak neither hunt nor eat brocket deer, [...] Odocoileus virginianus and tapirs (Tapirus terrestris); these animals are considered by {{them as part of}} the same group of origin as human beings.|$|E

50|$|The Colombian <b>chachalaca</b> (Ortalis columbiana) is {{a species}} of bird in the Cracidae family. It is endemic to the forests and {{woodlands}} in the inter-Andean valleys in Colombia. It was formerly treated as a subspecies of the speckled <b>chachalaca.</b>|$|R

50|$|Hunting of {{the plain}} <b>chachalaca</b> is {{restricted}} to subsistence hunting, for example by the Mayan people in southern Mexico. The plain <b>chachalaca</b> population is 500,000-5,000,000 (2006 IUCN Red List). It is not threatened. However the subspecies from Útila Island, O. v. deschauenseei, has sometimes been listed as extinct, but recent surveys have confirmed that it still survives.|$|R

50|$|The blue-billed curassow (Crax alberti) or {{blue-knobbed curassow}} is {{a species of}} bird in the Cracidae family, which {{includes}} the <b>chachalacas,</b> guans, and curassows.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chachalacas</b> {{are mainly}} brown galliform birds from the genus Ortalis. These birds {{are found in}} wooded {{habitats}} in far southern United States (Texas), Mexico, and Central and South America. They are social, can be very noisy and often remain fairly common even near humans, as their relatively small size makes them less desirable to hunters than their larger relatives. They somewhat resemble the guans, and the two have commonly been placed in a subfamily together, though the <b>chachalacas</b> are probably closer to the curassows.|$|E

50|$|Cracids {{are large}} birds, similar in general {{appearance}} to turkeys. The guans and curassows live in trees, but the smaller <b>chachalacas</b> {{are found in}} more open scrubby habitats. Many species are fairly long tailed, which may be an aide to navigating their largely arboreal existence. They are generally dull-plumaged, but the curassows and some guans have colourful facial ornaments. The birds in this family are particularly vocal, with the <b>chachalacas</b> taking their name {{from the sound of}} their call. Cracids range in size from the little chachalaca (Ortalis motmot), at as little as 38 cm and 350 g, to the great curassow (Crax rubra), at nearly 1 m and 4.3 kg.|$|E
50|$|Flora include Pochote, Mesquite and Tepehuaje. Fauna include wild boar, coyote, badger, rabbit, armadillo, <b>chachalaca</b> and buzzard.|$|R

50|$|The grey-headed chachalaca is less noisy than plain or rufous-vented <b>chachalacas.</b> It has a peeping white, white, white contact {{call and}} {{a chorus of}} raucous kraaak sounds, but does not give the chachalaca call of its relatives.|$|E
50|$|Higher {{lands are}} {{inhabited}} by such mammals as the gray brocket, capybara, peccary, howler monkey and puma; birds include <b>chachalacas</b> and rails. The maned wolf {{can be found}} in the lowlands, along with such birds as the greater rhea and seriemas.|$|E
50|$|The band-tailed guan (Penelope argyrotis) is {{a species}} of bird in the Cracidae family, the <b>chachalacas,</b> guans, and curassows. It is found in Colombia and Venezuela. Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests and heavily degraded former forest.|$|E
50|$|The plain <b>chachalaca</b> (Ortalis vetula) {{is a large}} bird in the <b>chachalaca,</b> guan and curassow family Cracidae. It breeds in {{tropical}} and subtropical environments from mezquital thickets in the Rio Grande Valley in southernmost Texas, United States to northernmost Costa Rica. In Central America, this species occurs in the Pacific lowlands from Chiapas, Mexico to northern Nicaragua and as a separate population in Costa Rica, where its range is separated by a short distance, as a disjunct population.|$|R
50|$|It was {{considered}} a subspecies of the little <b>chachalaca.</b> In fact, some taxonomic authorities still consider it conspecific, including the American Ornithological Society.|$|R
50|$|This species frequents dry {{and moist}} forests, {{especially}} where interspersed with scrub and savanna. Usually found {{in groups of}} up to 15 birds, the plain <b>chachalaca</b> is furtive and wary and prefers to escape from danger by running swiftly {{on the ground or}} leaping and gliding through brushy tangles. The plain <b>chachalaca</b> feeds in trees or on the ground on fruit (figs, palms, Sapotaceae), seeds, leaves, and flowers. It is sometimes a pest of crops such as tomatoes and cucumbers.|$|R
