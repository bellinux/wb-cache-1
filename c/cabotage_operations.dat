The productivity of the logistic system of these companies {{is based on the}} ports that represent the main element of the supply chain. The port performance, either the TUP - Terminais de Uso Misto Privativo and the Public Port in Manaus, are as in the following, related to the national average. This article seeks to identify the main attributes of standstill and its influence over the productivity in the <b>cabotage</b> of portuary <b>operation.</b> The expression attribute of standstill refers to the motive in which the ship stopped its operation in the terminal, these standstills correspond to 46 % of the raw time of operation. The result obtained, from the importance of the attribute, indicates that the shipowner (48 %) is the responsible for the standstills in the operation and the line of regression shows that the index of the attribute changes linearly the behavior of the productivity in the operation...|$|R
