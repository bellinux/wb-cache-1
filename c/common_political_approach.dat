However, on 16 January 2006 the European Commission [...] "launched a public consultation on how future action in patent policy to create an EU-wide system of protection can best take account of stakeholders' needs." [...] The Community patent {{was one of the}} issues the consultation focused on. More than 2500 replies were received. According to the European Commission, the consultation showed that there is widespread support for the Community patent but not at any cost, and [...] "in particular {{not on the basis of}} the <b>Common</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Approach</b> reached by EU Ministers in 2003".|$|E
40|$|This article {{introduces}} the emergence {{and development of}} political and economic relations between New Zealand and the EU since the mid XX century till present. The progressive strengthening of the mutual cooperation has the positive effect on the market liberalization in YUTR and allows New Zealand to focus not only on the Asian market, but also become a reliable field for investment for Western partners. Today, relations between New Zealand and the European Union (EU) are based on the principles set in the Joint Declaration on the development of relations and cooperation, signed in Lisbon on 21 September 2007 in addition to the Joint Declaration of 1999 and the Plan of joint actions in 2004 entitled “Priorities for future cooperation”. Political contacts at the highest level between the EU and New Zealand, as well as practical steps taken by the European Union, such as enlargement of the Permanent Mission in New Zealand in 2014 and the strengthening of trade and economic relations, may testify in favor of the further intensification of relations between them in the foreseeable future. However, the result of this convergence will largely depend on the situation within the European Union, which currently faces serious problems related to a number of factors, including admission of new members with weak economies, the systemic crisis of the EU economies, the issue of debt of Greece, the lack of a <b>common</b> <b>political</b> <b>approach</b> of the participants to the important international issues, regulation of the market of agricultural products etc...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThis thesis aims {{to compare}} BEE with the {{economic}} empowerment strategies of Afrikaner nationalism in order to root discussion around Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment within a context of economic nationalism. This approach avoids narrow critiques of BEE as affirmative action and provides a fresh historical perspective to the ANC’s efforts at transformation and redress. The comparison allows for insight to the different levels of success achieved by the economic nationalist strategies of Afrikaner empowerment and Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment. This thesis explores micro-studies to illustrate the complex issues raised by empowerment policies of Afrikaner (post 1924) and African nationalism (post 1994). In particular this serves to offer an alternative perspective the more <b>common</b> broad <b>political</b> <b>approaches</b> to BEE and highlights the policy’s effect at a micro-level...|$|R
40|$|The Nordic {{countries}} are all established welfare states, {{and there has}} for some time existed a notion of a distinctive Nordic or Scandinavian welfare state. Considerable differences seem to exist between for example the psychiatric services within, as well as between, the Nordic countries {{when it comes to}} history, mental health acts and allocation of resources. Some argue that it is not even possible to speak of a <b>common</b> Nordic <b>political</b> <b>approach</b> to public health, since all programs contain contradictory policies and ideological statements regarding the emphasis on individual behavior versus choice and living conditions and political responsibilities. Lately, the Nordic countries have performed well in comparative research of health policy in European countries but also regarding health care system in OECD countries. While it appears that the case for the existence of a Nordic model is strong there is actually no consensus of the precise specification of the feature that defines the model. Despite similarities in health care and health policy performance the Nordic countries seem to be quite diverse regarding the prevalence of depression (and the information provided) and sales of antidepressants...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFor over 20 years {{researchers}} have urged international managers to take culture into account. Focussing on culture raises {{the problem of}} using relevant units of analysis. This article advocates that national cultures should be considered even in the global economic context. First, analysis on the national scale makes sense when it is grounded in a <b>political</b> <b>approach</b> to culture. Second, {{the relevance of the}} national level is illustrated by the case of Switzerland. If at first sight, Switzerland is a country with multiple internal cultures and borders, a closer analysis shows that the Swiss people share a <b>common</b> <b>political</b> culture based upon attachment to local communities and institutions, to government through consensus and to conflict solving by resorting to arbitration and pragmatism. In the Swiss case, the article shows that management practices are embedded in national political cultures. Validity of the national <b>political</b> culture <b>approach</b> beyond the Swiss case is examined and implications for managers working in cross-cultural environments are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{will focus}} on our {{understanding}} of the nature of concepts within political theory. We will begin by noting that our possession of a functional conceptual model is a vital, perhaps essential, prerequisite for rich and useful theorizing about political concepts. We will then hypothesise that the model of the concept common to political study is not fully functional, but problematic, and a likely source of some of the difficulties political theorists have in offering useful definitions of key political concepts. In the first chapter we shall seek to uncover and document a <b>common</b> <b>political</b> <b>approach</b> to the concept. This will be achieved by focusing on a case-study - the debates over the meaning of the term freedom. Using the works of a number of scholars, but particularly Isaiah Berlin, we will attempt to explicate a common conceptual model that these contributors presuppose. With this achieved we will then draw upon the conceptual theory of both the disciplines of analytical philosophy and the cognitive sciences, in order to mount a critique of this conceptual model. Having done so, we will attempt to construct an alternative conceptual account, which addresses the shortcomings of current approaches, and also takes into account the particular nature of political terms. In the final section we will assess the potential of such an approach as a tool for future conceptual research. We will document how it has the capacity to both offer a richer account of political concepts, and moderate the contestation which is often characteristic of political terms. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|Current growing {{interest}} in mining in Solomon Islands warrants critical reflection on the centrality of natural resources in the post-colonial formation of state-society interactions, in particular, {{as they have been}} shaped by decades of forestry resources extraction. Since independence in 1978 waves of Malaysian, Taiwanese, Korean, Australian and Japanese investors have developed natural resource extraction projects. Not only have these projects been poorly regulated, they have entwined politicians, leaders and landholders with the state as an economic agent with its own base of economic power. As a result, wealth in Solomon Islands is highly politicised and dependent on the bargaining position of the state and foreign investors (Bennett 1987, 2002). Instead of looking at the failures of the state, as is <b>common</b> in <b>political</b> science <b>approaches</b> to Solomon Islands, we draw on case studies in forestry, mining, and customary land dealings on the island of Malaita and on the Weathercoast of Guadalcanal to highlight the kinds of social networks that enable agreements over the use of natural resources. Challenging common assumptions about the division between state and society, we show that leaders in rural regions of Solomon Islands behave like landlords, that brokers from the communities see themselves as actors equalling the state, and that the state performs like a capitalist actor. 16 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary {{philosophy}} {{of human rights}} is dominated by two seemingly opposed approaches. This dissertation {{is concerned with the}} choice between them. The traditional approach to human rights is characterized by the belief that human rights are moral rights that all human beings possess simply in virtue of their humanity. The <b>political</b> <b>approach</b> to human rights is characterized by the belief that human rights are those rights that possess an essential <b>political</b> function. Each <b>approach</b> faces a unique challenge, and attending to how each challenge is met reveals that the two approaches are more similar than first supposed. However, there remains an important difference between the two approaches regarding the concept of a human right. I argue that the conceptual claim made by the <b>political</b> <b>approach</b> is false. In Chapter One I focus on the traditional approach to human rights. It has an unclear connection to the existing international political discourse and practice of human rights. I call the challenge for the traditional approach the demand of taking the practice seriously. I argue that the traditional account can do so in at least three important ways that demand might be understood. In satisfying this demand, the traditional approach is shown to be in agreement with the <b>political</b> <b>approach</b> in an important way. In Chapter Two I focus on the <b>political</b> <b>approach</b> to human rights. In focusing on the existing political practice of human rights, the <b>political</b> <b>approach</b> can appear overly descriptive in nature. Its challenge is to account for the distinctive moral authority of human rights. (cont.) I call this challenge the normativity challenge and I argue that the <b>political</b> <b>approach</b> has an effective answer to this concern. However, that answer is indistinguishable from that offered by the traditional <b>approach.</b> Thus, the <b>political</b> <b>approach</b> is shown to be in agreement with the traditional approach in an important way. However, there is an important difference between the two <b>approaches.</b> The <b>political</b> <b>approach</b> ties the concept of a human right to a distinctive political function. The traditional approach rejects this conceptual claim. In Chapter Three I argue that the <b>political</b> <b>approach's</b> conceptual claim is false. by Sean Jamison Holland. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The present master thesis {{deals with}} European {{identity}} {{as an important}} aspect for the further development of the European Union. Several theories regarding identity in general and political collective identity in particular are applied to the European Union as a citizen based community. Conditions, which are needed {{for the development of}} a common identity among citizens of the European Union, are elaborated. Therefore data of the statistical poll “Eurobarometer” are used to asses the European citizen’s feelings, expectations and attitudes regarding the important identity issues. The main result shows that a European identity could not only be based on shared values or attitudes. Especially for a <b>common</b> <b>political</b> identity a real European political community, an effective European political civil society and one <b>common</b> European <b>political</b> public arena has to be established by the European citizens. Thereby a <b>common</b> <b>political</b> project, comparable with the European peace project, is considered as the main starting point for the future development of a shared European “We-feeling”...|$|R
