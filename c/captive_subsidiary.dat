The definitive version is available at: [URL] technology (IT) development in global organisations relies heavily on the transfer of tacit and complex knowledge from onshore units to offshore subsidiaries. A central concern of such organisations is the development of social capital, which is known to facilitate the smooth transfer of knowledge. However, only a few studies in IS research have explicitly examined the role of social capital for knowledge transfer in an IT offshoring context. In this paper, we argue that such knowledge transfer mechanisms can be understood better by considering social capital in concert with knowledge senders' efficacy and outcome expectations, two of the potentially keymotivational drivers of knowledge transfer. We develop our arguments through a qualitative case study of a large German multinational company. German IT developers in this firm provided in-depth accounts of their experience with offshore colleagues in an Indian <b>captive</b> <b>subsidiary</b> unit. Drawing on our analysis, we develop a model that depicts the influence of social capital, efficacy and outcome expectations on onshore IT developers' ability and willingness to transfer knowledge to offshore colleagues. Through the model, we also explain how social capital, efficacy and outcome expectations are interrelated and generate three interlocked, self-reinforcing circles of knowledge transfer success in IToffshoring relationships...|$|E
40|$|Why do manufacturer-owned car lessors lose so {{much money}} on leases, despite having {{proprietary}} information unavailable to other lessors? This paper explores how conflicts in organizational focus within vertically integrated firms can hurt subsidiary performance. To examine this, I identify {{the differences between the}} reaction of the <b>captive</b> leasing <b>subsidiaries</b> of automobile manufacturers to product and market characteristics and the reaction of their independent leasing competitors. While independent lessors write contracts that reflect risk from obsolescence and durability concerns, captives clearly pursue a second agenda from their corporate parents—the use of lease subsidization to sell unwanted vehicles. And while intentional lease subsidization may ultimately benefit the manufacturer, the organizational focus of car manufacturers on sales and market share has the additional effect of hindering the <b>captive</b> <b>subsidiary’s</b> ability to account for risk in lease contracts even when subsidization is unnecessary. I find evidence that unlike their independent competitors, captive lessors fail to adjust lease terms to variation i...|$|R
40|$|Williamson's {{theory of}} {{hierarchy}} {{is used to}} show that the widespread and, before now, unexplained corporate practice of establishing <b>captive</b> finance <b>subsidiaries</b> may be understood as an instance of multidivisonal-form reorganization. It is argued that such reorganization enhances internal efficiency and eases the monitoring task of lenders, thus facilitating borrowing. The debt ratios of firms in five U. S. industries are examined and the evidence, while not conclusive, provides support for the hypothesis. Thinking of <b>captive</b> finance <b>subsidiaries</b> in terms of the theory of hierarchy is consistent with the rationale for finance subsidiaries presented by corporate officers. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Risk matters when {{corporate}} debt {{has a positive}} probability of default. Lenders have traditionally used covenants to protect their property rights because the financing and operating decisions of firms can reduce {{the value of the}} firm’s outstanding debt. We examine the use of <b>captive</b> finance <b>subsidiaries</b> and special purposed entities (SPEs) to partition default risk within the firm. A more complex arrangement of property rights within the firm allows the parent firm to retain operating flexibility while offering lenders better protection. We conclude that capital structure is a relevant decision variable for corporate managers because firms are able to obtain leveraged finance at a lower cost when risk is partitioned using separate legal structures within the firm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Two recent Department of Labor (DOL) {{decisions}} have {{cleared the way}} for <b>captive</b> insurance <b>subsidiaries</b> to insure the employee benefits of their parent firms. This paper examines whether using captives for this purpose is beneficial for employ-ees and whether employee benefit premiums should be tax deductible in this case. We conclude that under the DOL’s conditions, the practice is advantageous for employees. Furthermore, we conclude that unless outside risk and outside premiums are added to the pooling arrangement, there’s no basis for permitting premiums to be tax deductible. The analysis suggests the Internal Revenue Service’s treatment of employ-ee benefit risk as “outside risk ” when insured by the parent company’s captive insurer is incorrect.

Using a sample for fourteen firms with publicly-traded debt, she computes and tests the statistical significance of abnormal returns to shareholders, bondholders, and the firm when captives are incorporated. She finds that shareholders gain 14. 9 percent, bondholders lose 2. 3 percent, and firm value increases a significant 10. 4 percent. The results are inconsistent with wealth expropriations and {{lend support to the}} importance of reputation to firms. Copyright 1989 by American Finance Association. ...|$|R

50|$|Rather than a co-op, as {{each of the}} {{previous}} sections has described, a <b>captive</b> is a <b>subsidiary</b> created to provide benefits to its parent company or companies - although when a captive is offered {{by more than one}} employer, the captive is a form of co-op. Captives present risk-management resources for employers who provide self-funded health plans to their respective employees. As is the case with all self-funding arrangements, when a self-funded health plan is offered by a captive, the captive, as opposed to any one particular employer, bears the risk.|$|R
40|$|Much {{resources}} have been expended {{over the years}} debating the tax treatment of insurance versus self insurance. This article reviews and analyzes the principal concepts and inconsistencies that have evolved {{in dealing with the}} issue of premium tax deductibility. The Internal Revenue Service considers market insurance as the only visible means of risk shifting and therefore the only one worthy of tax deductibility. It is argued that other forms of risk reduction can be equally effective in reducing risk. The social cost associated with the present tax policy that favors market insurance over other forms of pre-loss risk financing are evaluated and depicted. The implicit objective of the article is to'shift the debate by refocusing on the question of an appropriate tax policy concerning risk financing, one that maximizes social welfare. On July 27, 1989, the U. S Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit Court rendered its decision in the case of Humana Inc. versus Commissioner (No. 88 - 1403), upholding the lower court's decision that premiums paid by a parent company to its <b>captive</b> insurance <b>subsidiary</b> shall not be deductible for incom...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} captive {{offshoring}} of new product development (NPD), i. e., relocating projects or project phases to foreign-based, wholly-owned, multinational corporation (MNC) <b>subsidiaries</b> (<b>captive</b> offshore units) {{to benefit from}} cost and efficiency advantages and/or from access to complementary technological resources and capabilities. Adopting a host country perspective, we theorize why different forms of local collaboration may complement or conflict with efficiency-seeking or arbitrage strategies and may thus influence why captive offshore units receive new product development orders from other MNC units located abroad. Using a sample from Brazil and applying structural equation modeling with partial least squares (PLS), we find that local NPD outsourcing constitutes a complementary relationship, while local cooperation with clients creates a trade-off relationship with captive offshoring. That these relationships are moderated by the captive offshore unit’s cost position within the MNC suggests that arbitrage effects transcend the headquarter-subsidiary relationship into the sphere of MNC subsidiaries’ local collaborations. Our findings imply that arbitrage in multinational contexts affects the interdependence between resources and transaction costs. Dirk M. Boeh...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{performance}} implications of service activities offshoring, meant as the delocalization of business services in foreign countries. Data {{have come from the}} Offshoring Research Network (ORN) and have been analysed using an Exploratory Factor Analysis to aggregate variables first and then through a two-stage approach to control for the potential endogeneity problem arising from the self-selection bias in the regression models. Through these models we investigate the relationship between the motivations leading to choose a specific offshoring location (i. e. strategic location drivers: low cost, resources availability, cultural proximity, and the presence of local networks) and both operational and strategic performance of the offshoring firm. Provided that offshoring may occur either through a wholly-owned <b>subsidiary</b> (<b>captive</b> offshoring) or by outsourcing the service activity (offshore outsourcing), we provide a contribution by investigating the moderating role of the governance model on the relationship between location drivers and performance. Our results show that both operational and strategic performance are affected positively by low cost and resources availability, while local networks has a positive impact on strategic performance and negative one on operational performance. Moreover, offshore outsourcing strengthens the effect of resources availability and local networks on operational performance, as well the effect of cultural proximity and resource availability on strategic performance, while captive offshoring strengthens the effect of low cost and local networks on strategic performance...|$|R
40|$|Scholars from {{a variety}} of {{research}} traditions have provided interesting insights into offshoring. For instance, international business (IB) scholars have documented the movement of production operations to overseas locations (e. g. Dunning, 1988), and management scholars have investigated global sourcing strategies focusing on the outsourcing of components to vendors (Kotabe and Omura, 1989; Kotabe and Murray, 1990). Scholars commonly distinguish between relocation of economic activities to foreign <b>subsidiaries,</b> <b>captive</b> offshoring, and relocation to external independent suppliers, offshore outsourcing (Lewin and Peeters, 2006; Doh et al., 2009). With this special issue of Industry and Innovation, we focus upon a particular type of offshoring: that of intangibles. Offshoring of intangibles refers to the “process of sourcing any business task, process, or function supporting domestic and global operations from abroad, in particular from lower cost emerging economies” (Manning et al., 2008 : 35). Over the last years, this practice has targeted increasingly higher value-adding activities related to a firm’s core business, such as research and development (R&D), engineering services and product design (von Zedtwitz and Gassmann, 2002; Bardhan, 2006; Chakrabarty et al., 2006; Couto et al., 2006; Manning et al., 2008). Offshoring of intangibles appears to be driven not only by cost saving, but also by a global sourcing-of-knowledge rationale, and must be seen as a novel type of internationalization (Maskell et al., 2007). In the early 2000 s (Lewin and Cuoto, 2007), the percentage of firms experimenting with offshoring of intangibles rapidly rose from around 5 percent to more than 30 percent, mostly involving services such as engineering design, data processing and analysis, software development, R&D and web hosting (Zaheer et al., 2009) ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} solvency risk, underwriting risk, investment incentives and tax management objectives on the reinsurance demand by a sample of UK-based liability insurance companies. In addition, the effects of firm-specific factors including firm size and firm profitability on the reinsurance decision of the sample of UK liability insurance companies is tested. Due {{to the fact that}} the demand for reinsurance is measured by the reinsurance claims ratio which should be restricted to the unit interval of zero to one, the sample panel data of 2103 firm/year observations is divided into two separate groups. One group includes the UK liability insurers with reinsurance claims ratios defined on the open interval of zero to one and the other group includes the UK liability insurance firms with reinsurance claims ratios equal to the boundary values of zero and/ or one. In group one, it is observed that underwriting risk and firm size are important determinants of the level of the reinsurance purchased by the UK liability insurance companies. Additionally, it is shown that firm size, firm profitability and solvency risk impact the amount of reinsurance purchased by the UK liability insurers in group two. As it is proved that firm size is an important determinant of the reinsurance demand, it should be investigated why it has opposite impacts on the UK liability insurers’ reinsurance decisions in the two separate groups of this study. It is shown that the sample of UK liability insurers mostly constitutes of large insurance companies which are engaging in reinsurance activities contrary to our prediction as they are providing reinsurance internally through their <b>captives</b> or their <b>subsidiaries.</b> On the other hand, the small to normal sized UK liability insurance companies are engaging in reinsurance activities consistent with our prediction and the smaller ones have higher reinsurance demands.
