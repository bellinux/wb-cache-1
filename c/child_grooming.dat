2500|$|Pedophilia {{is not a}} legal term, {{and having}} a sexual {{attraction}} to children is not illegal. In law enforcement circles, the term pedophile is sometimes used informally to refer to any person who commits one or more sexually-based crimes that relate to legally underage victims.

One unit of the United Kingdom's Child Abuse Investigation Command {{is known as the}} [...] "Paedophile Unit" [...] and specializes in online investigations and enforcement work. Some forensic science texts, such as Holmes (2008), use the term to refer to offenders who target child victims, even when such children are not the primary sexual interest of the offender. FBI agent Kenneth Lanning, however, makes a point of distinguishing between pedophiles and child molesters.|$|E

50|$|Following the Sexual Offences Act 2003 which {{introduced}} {{new legislation}} into England and Wales, there were calls by {{politicians and the}} police for similar laws to come into force in Scotland.

Some people suspected of grooming children over the internet for sex abuse had been charged with breach of the peace or lewd and libidinous practises.

40|$|The primary {{argument}} {{this chapter}} makes {{is that the}} existing law may inadvertently underplay or even increase the potential risk of harm from Online <b>Child</b> Sexual <b>Grooming</b> (OCSG), as the OCSG process is not criminalised by the so called ‘grooming offence’ under section 15 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (s. 15 offence). The history of <b>child</b> sexual <b>grooming</b> is difficult to put into context because it has only recently been recognised, not only academically, but legally, as a distinct stage {{of the process of}} child sexual abuse. Online grooming has proved similarly difficult to define. This chapter explores the phenomenon of OCSG alongside current understandings of the grooming process to illustrate how OCSG allows a groomer to progress through the stages of grooming more quickly because, for example, personal information is readily available on social networking sites, and enables the groomer to target several children at once. The internet is a site of vulnerability {{not only because of the}} potential it offers to access children across national boundaries but also because of the relative anonymity it affords to the groomer. Groomers who target adolescents online are better able to conceal their identities than ‘face-to-face’ groomers, and can entice adolescents into ‘virtual relationships’. The online groomer’s development of trust and compliance may involve sexually explicit communications and the exchange of sexually explicit images of the child, a valuable tool to ensure further compliance and secrecy due to the threat of the material being publicly released. Having analysed the phenomenon of OCSG, the chapter then turns to its central focus: the way in which the law tackles OCSG and the limitations of the current s. 15 offence. Despite the absence of a common definition of the phenomenon and ambiguity surrounding what constitutes grooming behaviour, it received significant attention by the legislature several years ago, leading to the announcement and enactment of the s. 15 offence (which relates to meeting with a <b>child</b> following <b>grooming).</b> Notwithstanding the law’s acknowledgment of the dangers the internet poses to <b>children,</b> online <b>grooming</b> behaviour and ‘meetings’ in the virtual world that occur as a part of OCSG are excluded from the s. 15 offence, despite amendments made in 2008 that were directly aimed at providing a greater level of protection to children by intervening in the grooming process at an earlier stage. This chapter concludes that the vagueness of what counts as grooming behaviour in the legislation encourages misconceptions about the dangers and risks OCSG poses to children and the circumstances in which grooming and online meetings could occur. This could result in children being offered less effective protection from sexual abuse...|$|R
50|$|A recent {{empirical}} {{study by}} Seinenu Thein-Lemelson (University of California, Berkeley) utilized an ethological approach to examine cross-cultural differences in human grooming {{as it pertains}} to caregiving behaviors. Naturalistic data was collected through video focal follows with children during routine activities and then coded for grooming behaviors. This cross-cultural comparison of urban families in Burma and the United States indicates that there are significant cross-cultural differences in rates of caregiver-to-child grooming. Burmese caregivers in the sample <b>groomed</b> <b>children</b> more often than caregivers in the United States. Additionally, children in the United States have short instances of concentrated grooming predominantly during daily activities that are structured explicitly around hygiene goals (bath time), in contrast to the Burmese <b>child,</b> whose <b>grooming</b> is distributed more evenly within and across daily activities. The Burmese parents maintained a constant vigilance with regard to risk of infection. The study is significant because it is the only study of human grooming to utilize naturalistic data.|$|R

It makes it easier to get access to <b>children,</b> to <b>groom</b> them and viciously entangle him/her in a promiscuous relationship.
