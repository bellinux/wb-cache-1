40|$|A previsível escassez de petróleo aliada a uma consciência ecológica está levando pesquisadores a procurar novas fontes de energia e processos de combustão mais eficientes e menos poluentes. Entre os combustíveis menos poluentes está o gás natural, cujo consumo aumenta ano a ano. Os motores de combustão interna são transformadores de energia que têm baixa eficiência de conversão. Este trabalho avaliou um motor Diesel, bicombustível, movido a Diesel e gás natural. Nesse motor, a energia provém, basicamente, da combustão do gás natural. O Diesel tem a função de produzir o início da combustão do gás, que é o combustível principal. Assim, haverá uma substituição parcial de óleo Diesel por gás natural, aumentando o rendimento da combustão. Inicialmente, foi feito um ensaio-testemunha, somente com óleo Diesel e após foram feitos ensaios, com três repetições, para variadas proporções de óleo Diesel, gás natural e ângulos de avanço da injeção. O melhor desempenho foi obtido para 22 % de óleo Diesel em relação ao máximo débito da bomba injetora e 13 L min- 1 de gás natural com ângulo de avanço de injeção {{original}} (21 º). Nesse caso, a potência média aumentou 14 %, e o consumo específico (medido em valores monetários) diminuiu 46 % em relação ao ensaio-testemunha. The foresight of a petroleum shortage and {{an ecological}} conscience is moving scientists {{to look for}} new sources of energy and to develop more efficient combustion processes and reduced emissions. Natural gas is a reduced emission fuel, whose consumption increases every year. The present work evaluates a dual fuel compression ignition engine. The major portion of the fuel burned is natural gas. The Diesel fuel acts as <b>combustion</b> <b>starter,</b> which ignites under the compression heat. Diesel fuel is used only as an ignition source. The partial substitution of Diesel fuel by natural gas increases the combustion efficiency and achieves significant emission reduction, because the combustion of natural gas produces less emission than the combustion of Diesel fuel. Initially, it was made a reference test using only Diesel fuel for comparison with following tests. There were made tests with varied proportions of Diesel fuel and natural gas, and with variable injection angles. There were made three repetitions for each test, including the reference test. The best performance was obtained with 22 % of Diesel fuel and 13 L min- 1 of natural gas, and with the engine original injection angle (21 º). In this case, the average power was 14 % above the standard engine {{and the cost of}} consumption was 46 % lower than the reference test...|$|E
50|$|Chargers for car {{batteries}} come {{in varying}} ratings. Chargers that are rated {{up to two}} amperes {{may be used to}} maintain charge on parked vehicle batteries or for small batteries on garden tractors or similar equipment. A motorist may keep a charger rated a few amperes to ten or fifteen amperes for maintenance of automobile batteries or to recharge a vehicle battery that has accidentally discharged. Service stations and commercial garages will have a large charger to fully charge a battery in an hour or two; often these chargers can briefly source the hundreds of amperes required to crank an internal <b>combustion</b> engine <b>starter.</b>|$|R
50|$|Versions of the Rolls-Royce Avon {{turbojet}} engine used a geared turbine starter motor that burned isopropyl nitrate as the fuel. In military service this monofuel had the NATO designation of S-746 AVPIN. For starting a measured amount of fuel {{was introduced to}} the <b>starter</b> <b>combustion</b> chamber then ignited electrically, the hot gases spinning the turbine at high revolutions with the exhaust exiting overboard.|$|R
50|$|An {{electric}} car is an automobile that is propelled {{by one or}} more electric motors, using electrical energy stored in rechargeable batteries. The first practical {{electric car}}s were produced in the 1880s. Electric cars were popular in the late 19th century and early 20th century, until advances in internal <b>combustion</b> engines, electric <b>starters</b> in particular, and mass production of cheaper gasoline vehicles led to a decline in the use of electric drive vehicles.|$|R
