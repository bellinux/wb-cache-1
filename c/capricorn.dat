5|$|The Allman Brothers Band is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band the Allman Brothers Band. It was {{released}} in the United States by Atco Records and <b>Capricorn</b> Records on November 4, 1969 and produced by Adrian Barber. Formed in 1969, the Allman Brothers Band came together following various musical pursuits by each individual member. Following his session work in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, Duane Allman moved to Jacksonville, Florida where he led large jam sessions with his new band, one he had envisioned as having two guitarists and two drummers. After rounding out the lineup {{with the addition of}} his brother, Gregg Allman, the band played free shows in public parks and moved to Macon, Georgia, where they were {{to be one of the}} premiere acts on <b>Capricorn.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{engravings}} {{resemble the}} finds in Teyjat; {{they are very}} delicate and approach a nearly photographic realism. Like in Teyjat, depictions of deer and reindeer clearly dominate (about 50%), followed by horses (about 30%), aurochs, bisons and <b>capricorns.</b> Even two bears and the already mentioned fox are represented.|$|R
5|$|Coconut crabs {{live in the}} Indian Ocean and {{the central}} Pacific Ocean, with a {{distribution}} that closely matches that of the coconut palm. The western limit {{of the range of}} B. latro is Zanzibar, off the coast of Tanzania, while the tropics of Cancer and <b>Capricorn</b> mark the northern and southern limits, respectively, with very few population in the subtropics, such as the Ryukyu Islands. There is evidence that the coconut crab once lived on the mainlands of Australia and Madagascar and on the island of Mauritius, but it no longer occurs in any of these places. As they cannot swim as adults, coconut crabs must have colonised the islands as planktonic larvae.|$|E
5|$|Eat a Peach is {{the third}} studio album by American rock band the Allman Brothers Band. Produced by Tom Dowd, the album was {{released}} on February 12, 1972, in the United States by <b>Capricorn</b> Records. Following their artistic and commercial breakthrough {{with the release of}} the live album At Fillmore East (1971), the Allman Brothers Band got to work on their third studio album. Many in the band were struggling, however, with heroin addictions, and checked into rehab to confront these problems. Shortly after leaving rehab, group leader and founder Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident in the band's home of Macon, Georgia thus making it the final album to feature the guitarist.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and {{the rest}} of the {{excursion}} party attempt to reach the bridge but are repeatedly attacked by the ship's Angel Hosts, androids resembling angels who were programmed to supply information but are now eliminating all passengers and crew. Morvin falls off of a ledge into the ship's engine, {{and the rest}} of the group are surrounded by Angel Hosts. Bannakaffalatta reveals that he is a cyborg, and uses his internal EMP device to disable the Hosts. The EMP burst drains the Zocci's power cells and he dies. Mr. Copper takes the EMP device, saying that if they can manage to recharge it, they can use it against the Hosts again. A lone Angel Host attacks them again, and Foon ties herself to it and throws them both into the ship's engine. The Doctor separates from the rest and attempts to reach Deck 31, where he hopes to find the controls for the Heavenly Hosts. He convinces the Hosts that he is a stowaway - neither passenger nor crew and thus not in the Hosts' kill mandate - and the confused androids take him to see their operator, Max <b>Capricorn.</b> Max explains that he planned the Titanics inevitable collision with Earth to bankrupt the company that voted him out. To save the Doctor, Astrid uses a forklift to ram Max <b>Capricorn</b> and push him into the ship's engine. The forklift falls into the engine on top of him, seemingly killing Astrid as well.|$|E
50|$|The marine board found {{evidence}} of violation of various navigation laws on the parts of <b>Capricorns</b> master and pilot. There were similar findings {{on the part of}} Blackthorns commanding officer and officer of the deck. These matters were referred to the commanders of the Seventh and Eighth Coast Guard Districts for further investigation and appropriate action.|$|R
50|$|<b>Capricorns</b> (sometimes stylized as CAPRICORNS) is an {{instrumental}} progressive metal band from London, United Kingdom mixing various elements of doom metal, sludge metal and math rock guitars. The band's lineup consisted of guitarist Nathan Dylan Bennett, guitarist Kevin Williams, bassist Dean Berry and drummer Nathan Perrier. They {{have been inspired}} by Italian horror and they feature ex-members of Orange Goblin and Iron Monkey.|$|R
50|$|The {{outer walls}} of the temple are richly ornamented with the friezes of elephants, horses, scrolls, scenes from epics, <b>capricorns,</b> swans {{and a number of}} gods and goddesses with their attendants. The scenes from the epics depict stories from Ramayana, Mahabharata and Bhagavata. The figures of Yoga-Madhava, Dhanvanthri, Dakshinamurthy, dancing Saraswathi, Kalinga-Mardhana, Para-Vasudeva, dancers and musicians are highly {{appealing}} to the eye.|$|R
5|$|Middle {{latitude}} glaciers {{are located}} either between the Tropic of Cancer and the Arctic Circle, or between the Tropic of <b>Capricorn</b> and the Antarctic Circle. Both areas support glacier ice from mountain glaciers, valley glaciers and even smaller icecaps, {{which are usually}} located in higher mountainous regions. All are located in mountain ranges, notably the Himalayas; the Alps; the Pyrenees; Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast Ranges of North America; the Patagonian Andes in South America; and mountain ranges in New Zealand. Glaciers in these latitudes are more widespread and tend to be greater in mass the closer they are to the polar regions. They are the most widely studied over the past 150 years. As with examples located in the tropical zone, virtually all the glaciers in the mid-latitudes {{are in a state}} of negative mass balance and are retreating.|$|E
5|$|The axial tilt of the Earth is {{approximately}} 23.439281° with {{the axis of}} its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies {{over the course of}} the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and winter taking place when the Tropic of <b>Capricorn</b> in the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.|$|E
5|$|The band carried on, {{adding new}} members Chuck Leavell on piano and Lamar Williams on bass. Brothers and Sisters was largely {{recorded}} {{over a period}} of three months at <b>Capricorn</b> Sound Studios in Macon, Georgia. Lead guitarist Dickey Betts assumed the role of band leader, and many of his compositions reflected a more country-inspired sound. Session musicians Les Dudek and Tommy Talton sat in to play guitar on several songs. The album was being produced {{at the same time as}} vocalist/organist Gregg Allman's solo debut, Laid Back, and features many of the same musicians and engineers. The front album cover features a photograph of Vaylor Trucks, the son of drummer Butch Trucks and his wife Linda. The back cover features a photograph of Brittany Oakley, the daughter of Berry Oakley and his wife, Linda.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2013, Plant {{hinted that}} he was open to a Led Zeppelin reunion in 2014, stating {{that he was}} not the reason for Led Zeppelin's {{dormancy}} for the <b>Capricorns</b> (Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones) [...] "are quite contained in their own worlds and leave it to him", adding that he was [...] "not the bad guy" [...] and that he had [...] "got nothing to do in 2014".|$|R

5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{appears to}} be {{generally}} sedentary within its range, especially {{in much of the}} Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales. However, in many places (generally south of the Tropic of <b>Capricorn),</b> populations may be present or absent at different times of the year, although this appears to result from nomadic rather than seasonal migratory movements. Around Wellington in central New South Wales, birds were recorded over winter months, and were more common in autumn around the Talbragar River. Birds were present all year round near Inverell in northern New South Wales, but noted to be flying eastwards from January to May, and westwards in June and July. In Jandowae in southeastern Queensland, birds were regularly recorded flying north and east from March to June, and returning south and west in July and August, and were absent from the area in spring and summer.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{there is}} often a need to correct for the {{apparent}} movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a spinning top. Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble. The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today. Nor did the stars rotate around Polaris as they do now. In the case of the Egyptian pyramids, it has been shown they were aligned towards Thuban, a faint star in the constellation of Draco. The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation <b>Capricorn.</b> In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in Sagittarius due to the precession of the equinoxes.|$|E
5|$|With Max <b>Capricorn</b> dead, the Heavenly Host divert to {{the next}} highest authority, the Doctor, and aid him in quickly {{reaching}} the bridge. Together with Midshipman Frame, he uses {{the heat from the}} entry into the Earth's atmosphere to restart the ship's auxiliary engines. The ship stabilises and narrowly avoids a collision with Buckingham Palace. The Doctor then realizes that Astrid was wearing a teleport bracelet when she fell into the engine. In an emergency, the teleport bracelets were programmed to hold a person's molecular pattern in stasis until it can be recovered. The Doctor frantically attempts to retrieve Astrid's pattern, but the machine is too badly damaged. The Doctor reluctantly allows the ghostly remains of Astrid's atoms to dissipate into space. As the surviving passengers wait for rescue, the Doctor and Mr. Copper, who would otherwise be sent to prison for committing fraud {{in order to get a}} job with the company, teleport to Earth and find that the TARDIS has landed unharmed in an snowy field, thrown from the ship after the collision. Mr. Copper is left to live on Earth with a credit card preloaded with £1,000,000, thanks to the Doctor.|$|E
