His observations were confirmed by the observatory of Christopher Clavius and he received a hero's welcome when he visited Rome in 1611. Galileo continued to observe the satellites over the next eighteen months, and by mid-1611, he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods—a feat which Kepler had believed impossible.|$|E

5|$|Researchers at Farmitalia soon {{discovered}} that changes in biological activity could be made by minor changes {{in the structure of}} the compound. A strain of Streptomyces was mutated using N-nitroso-N-methyl urethane, and this new strain produced a different, red-colored antibiotic. They named this new compound Adriamycin, after the Adriatic Sea, and the name was later changed to doxorubicin to <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> established naming convention. Doxorubicin showed better activity than daunorubicin against mouse tumors, and especially solid tumors. It also showed a higher therapeutic index, yet the cardiotoxicity remained.|$|E

5|$|The Pictish {{relationship}} with Rome {{appears to have}} been less overtly hostile than their Caledonian predecessors, at least in the beginning. There were no more pitched battles and conflict was generally limited to raiding parties {{from both sides of the}} frontier until immediately prior to and after the Roman retreat from Britannia. Their apparent success in holding back Roman forces cannot be explained solely with reference to the remoteness of Caledonia or the difficulties of the terrain. In part it may have been due to the difficulties encountered in subjugating a population that did not <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> strictures of local governance that Roman power usually depended on to operate through.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{standard}} {{is a set}} of guidelines which are used to ensure that the animals produced by a breeder or breeding facility <b>conform</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> specifics of the standardized breed.

A judge in a show will judge the cattle against a provided breed standard.|$|E

Hitler was deeply affected by the death of his younger brother Edmund, who died in 1900 from measles. Hitler changed from a confident, outgoing, conscientious student to a morose, detached boy who constantly fought with his father and teachers.|$|E
