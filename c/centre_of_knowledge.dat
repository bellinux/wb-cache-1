This paper addresses the clustering of new biotechnology firms around <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> production, {{by focusing on}} the role played by social networks in terms of access to scientific and technological knowledge. Our approach takes into consideration the impact of various forms of proximity – geographical, social, cognitive and organisational – upon the development of key relationships, as well as upon their use for knowledge acquisition. It enables us to assess the relative importance of local and distant knowledge sources, and to interpret the decisions taken by entrepreneurs with respect to network mobilisation. The empirical operationalisation of this approach is then discussed based on a suggested methodology that makes it possible to reconstruct social {{networks and}} to measure different types of proximity...|$|R
50|$|The Portuguese {{economy had}} benefited from its {{connections}} with neighbouring Muslim states. A money economy was well enough established for 15th century {{workers in the}} countryside {{as well as in}} the towns to be paid in currency. The agriculture of the countryside had diversified to the point where grain was imported from Morocco (a symptom of an economy dependent upon Portugal's), while specialised crops occupied former grain-growing areas: vineyards, olives, or the sugar factories of the Algarve, later to be reproduced in Brazil (Braudel 1985). Most of all, the Aviz dynasty that had come to power in 1385 marked the semi-eclipse of the conservative land-oriented aristocracy (See The Consolidation of the Monarchy in Portugal.) A constant exchange of cultural ideals made Portugal a <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> and technological development. Due to these connections with Islamic kingdoms, many mathematicians and experts in naval technology appeared in Portugal. The Portuguese government impelled this even further by taking full advantage of this and by creating several important research centres in Portugal, where Portuguese and foreign experts made several breakthroughs in the fields of mathematics, cartography and naval technology. Sagres and Lagos in the Algarve become famous as such places.|$|E

With the Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate based in Konya taking over the Beylik of Danishmend in the late 12th century, Malatya became part of their realm. Under Danishmend and Seljuk rule, Malatya became a <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> as many Persian and Arabic {{scholars}} took residence in the city. The Seljuk Sultanate also undertook an extensive development of the city. After being ruled by the Ilkhanids for around 50 years {{at the end of}} the 13th century, the Muslim population of the city invited the Mamluk Sultanate to Malatya in 1315. On 28 April 1315, the Mamluk army entered the city; this was followed by the looting of the city by the army. The Eretna Dynasty gained sovereignty over the city for some time, but in from 1338 onwards the Mamluks secured its control. However, for the latter part of the 14th century, the control of the city fluctuated between the Mamluks and the Dulkadirids. The city was captured by the Ottoman army led by Yavuz Sultan Selim on 28 July 1516 and remained under Ottoman rule until the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. Under the Ottomans, the city lost the quality of being on the frontiers, as well as the allure it held in the Middle Ages. It was plagued between the 16th and 18th centuries by successive rebellions.|$|E

This talk series has gained reputation due to constancy, punctuality and commitment towards the society. To enhance the range of this activity run constantly for elders and children since 15 years, the library has started arranging such talk series for youth and women since 2003.The city of Navsari is well known for literature, arts, music, culture and learning. Shri Sayaji Vaibhav Sarvajanik Library - {{regarded as one of the}} best libraries in Gujarat - is a unique ornament of the civilized affluent city of Navsari. In appreciation of its commendable work for the excellent library services and wide extension of knowledge, this library has been awarded Shri Motibhai Amin Granthalay Seva Paritoshik certificate by the Government of Gujarat for five times i.e. in 1983-83, 1993-94, 2001-02, 2006-07 and 2007-08, which is a matter of pride for the library.This library was established in 1898 by the prosperous Maharaja Sayajirao Gayakwad of Vadodara. Before that a small library named “Sarvajanik Reading Room” had started in 1878. In 1898, both these were amalgamated at the Laxman Hall and jointly “Shri Sayaji Vaibhav Sarvajanik Pustakalaya” was established. In 1907, on the appeal of the then Suba Rao Bahadur Govindbhai Hathibhai Desai, Maharaja Sayajirao Gayakwad allotted the fund surplus from Maharaja Sayajirao’s silver jubilee celebration fund. The library was built in 1910 at the cost of Rs.8100 on the land given by the inheritors of Gokaldas Narsinhdas Parekh, Khushaldas Narsinhdas Parekh and Ramdas Shivdas Modi. The library was declared open for the readers in 1911. Years ago, a branch of this library was run in a school on Bandar Road (Raychand Road).In 1910, the old building of the library was built. Thereafter, a new hall was built on the occasion of 75 years celebration of the institution.In 1973, 3100 sq. ft. construction was done on the occasion of the 75 years celebration of the institution. A part of the north-east side of the library was damaged in the earthquake in 2001.
