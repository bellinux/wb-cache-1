50|$|In 1953, Youngdahl {{dismissed}} perjury {{charges against}} Owen Lattimore, a professor {{who had been}} charged with lying before a Senate Committee when he testified that he was unsympathetic to Communism. Youngdahl found that the indictment was too vague and that the prosecution would hinder free speech. In 1955, after new charges had been brought against Lattimore, Youngdahl again dismissed the <b>charges</b> on First <b>Amendment</b> grounds. After the United States Court of Appeals affirmed Youngdahl's decision, the case was dropped.|$|R

25|$|The {{coalition}} government vowed {{to amend the}} 2007 constitution which they called undemocratic, prompting PAD to resume protests against the constitutional amendment plan after having suspended its movement after the 2006 coup. PAD <b>charged</b> that the <b>amendment</b> was aimed at revoking charges against Thaksin and election fraud charges by PPP executive members. The Samak government suspended its amendment plan, yet PAD vowed to continue their protest, calling for Samak Sundaravej's resignation, noting that during his election campaign, he had declared himself a nominee of Thaksin. Tensions escalated when PAD seized Government House.|$|R

She said that empowering federal authorities to enforce a constitutional right for women to vote in the South could lead to similar enforcement of the constitutional right of African Americans to vote there, a right that was being evaded, and, in her opinion, rightly so. Her committee was too small to seriously affect the NAWSA's direction, but her public condemnation of the proposed amendment, expressed in terms of vehement racism, deepened fissures within the organization.|$|R

50|$|When booking {{through a}} hotel {{consolidator}} or from hotel consolidator’s retailer {{you can either}} get the least appealing room in the hotel, or {{you can get a}} surprising free upgrade to a higher class room if all other standard rooms have been sold out. The key advantage of booking a hotel room through a hotel consolidator is that just one call or just one website visit can get you a room at a 20 to 35% discounted price. The key disadvantage is that prices are not negotiable and the cancellation and <b>amendment</b> <b>charges</b> can be pretty harsh. Additional benefit of hotel consolidators is that they have rooms available when all other hotels are sold out during conventions and trade fairs.|$|R
50|$|That September, a fifth {{amendment}} {{was passed in}} response to recommendations from the Constitutional Court, the European Commission and the Venice Commission. Approved by Fidesz parliamentarians, it was opposed by LMP and the Socialists, while Jobbik abstained. The provision granted the National Bank oversight of financial markets; eliminated a provision allowing judicial cases to be transferred from one court to another, {{as well as one}} allowing taxes to be raised for financing fines charged to the Hungarian state by international court rulings; clarified the recognition of religious communities and allowed political campaign ads to be aired on public as well as commercial television and radio free of <b>charge.</b> Following the <b>amendment's</b> adoption, Jagland praised the fact that the government had made an effort to address international criticism.|$|R
50|$|The {{district}} court ruled in Schempp's favor, and {{struck down the}} Pennsylvania statute. The school district appealed the ruling, and while that appeal was pending, the Pennsylvania legislature amended the statute to allow children to be excused from the exercises upon the written request of their parents. This change did not satisfy Schempp, however, and he continued his action against the school district, <b>charging</b> that the <b>amendment</b> of the law did not change its nature as an unconstitutional establishment of religion. Because {{of the change in}} the law, the Supreme Court had responded to the school district's appeal by vacating the first ruling and remanding the case to the {{district court}}. The district court again found for Schempp. The school district appealed to the Supreme Court again, and, on appeal, the case was consolidated with a similar Maryland case launched by Madalyn Murray.|$|R
40|$|In November, 1975, {{the voters}} of Clallam County passed a {{proposition}} creating a board of Freeholders whose <b>charge,</b> according to <b>Amendment</b> 21 of the Washington State Constitution, was to write a "Home Rule " Charter to submit to {{the voters of}} Clallam County for their approval or rejection. Fifteen Freeholders were elected, three of whom subsequently resigned. Those three were Howard V. "Mike " Doherty, Jr., who resigned when his appointment in March 1976 by Governor Evans to the office of Clallam County Commissioner caused a conflict of interest; John Swingle, who became ineligible in August upon moving out of the district in which he was elected; and Fred Sindars, who resigned in August over a disagreement with a majority decision of the board. The Freeholders undertook a comprehensive study of the existing form of Clallam County government.

50|$|NAWSA's {{strategy}} {{at that point}} was to gain suffrage for women on a state-by-state basis until it achieved {{a critical mass of}} voters that could push through a suffrage amendment at the national level.In 1913, the Southern States Woman Suffrage Committee was formed in an attempt to stop that process from moving past the state level. It was led by Kate Gordon, who had been the NAWSA's corresponding secretary from 1901 to 1909.Gordon, who was from the southern state of Louisiana, supported women's suffrage but opposed the idea of a federal suffrage <b>amendment,</b> <b>charging</b> that it would violate states' rights.

5000|$|HCJ 5304/15 Israel Medical Association v. Israel Knesset of September 11, 2016: Rubinstein, {{joined by}} other justices on the High Court, denied {{petitions}} {{on behalf of}} Palestinian hunger strikers imprisoned on terrorism-related <b>charges,</b> challenging an <b>amendment</b> to the law that permits their force-feeding by physicians. Declaring the amendment constitutional, Rubinstein, writing for the Court, declared that a hunger striker [...] "is not an ordinary patient but a person who knowingly and willingly places himself in a dangerous situation as a protest or a means of attaining a personal or public goal." [...] He also noted that laws in France, the United States, Australia, Germany, and Austria enable forced artificial feeding under exceptional cases that vary from country to country. Moreover, he argued, relevant decisions of the European Court of Human Rights do not completely prohibit forced feeding. Although security considerations by themselves do not justify the use of forced treatment, Rubinstein stated, such considerations may be weighed when a treating physician has already determined that the prisoner’s medical status is grave {{and that there is}} a real danger to his or her life or that lack of treatment will expose the prisoner to an irreversible serious handicap.|$|R
5000|$|Gallegly {{argued that}} Plyler imposed an unfunded federal mandate on the states. [...] "Come to America for opportunity. Do {{not come to}} America to live off the law-abiding American taxpayer," [...] he said. Emotions ran high during early House debate: Representative Gary Ackerman (D-NY) commented, [...] "After I got over my initial reaction, I {{decided not to go}} out and commit any crimes of violence," [...] with other Democrats {{describing}} the amendment as [...] "hideous." [...] Nevertheless the amendment was supported by Speaker Newt Gingrich, who stated, [...] "There is no question that offering free taxpayer goods to illegals attracts more illegals...It is wrong for us to be the welfare capital of the world." [...] In comparison, Gingrich had not favored a full federal version of Proposition 187 during its passage, which was a complete ban and contained no option of merely <b>charging</b> tuition. The <b>amendment</b> was also supported by Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, who welcomed the prospect of a veto by President Clinton that would demonstrate that Clinton was not serious about immigration reform and aid Dole's run for president. Dole stated the amendment would free up $1.8 billion and allow either the hiring of 51,000 new teachers or the purchase of 3.6 million new school computers.|$|R
5000|$|Shapiro's {{change of}} heart {{came at a time}} when tabloids were {{immersed}} in controversy due to the mysterious death of Diana, Princess of Wales, who died during a paparazzi chase in Paris on August 31, 1997. British journalism professor Michael Tracey, who was teaching mass media at the University of Colorado convinced Shapiro that continuing to work for the tabloids would be immoral since Shapiro believed the stories accusing John Ramsey were false. Shapiro felt compassion for the people his editors were targeting, and he telephoned John Ramsey to apologize for his participation in the tabloid journalism world. Soon thereafter, Shapiro reported his editors to the FBI for conspiring to blackmail lead Boulder Detective Steve Thomas for sealed grand jury evidence, and revealed how his editors engaged in commercial bribery and illegal information brokering. The FBI was unable to refer the case to the United States Attorney, but criminal charges were filed by Colorado prosecutors. A grand jury was convened by the Jefferson County District Attorney's Office and the [...] "Globe" [...] challenged the <b>charges</b> on First <b>Amendment</b> grounds. The Colorado Supreme Court ruled against the tabloid, and Globe editors pledged to donate $100,000 to the University of Colorado journalism ethics studies program and publicly admit they had acted [...] "unethically" [...] in exchange for a dismissal of all charges.|$|R
40|$|Jurisdiction {{stripping}} {{is the new}} constitutional amendment, and the Exceptions Clause is the new Article V. But despite legal academia’s long-running obsessions {{with the}} meaning of constitutional amendment and the limits (if any) on Congress’s power to control federal jurisdiction, we still lack even {{a basic understanding of}} how these two forms of constitutional politicking interact. As legislators increasingly propose and pass jurisdiction-stripping legislation and pursue politically <b>charged</b> constitutional <b>amendments,</b> these constitutional processes have begun to step off of the pages of law reviews and into the halls of Congress. The looming collision between them makes it all the more essential that each be understood. This Article advances that understanding by exploring the connections between the amendment process and the Exceptions Clause, illuminating the meaning, impact, and limits of each. In order to properly identify constraints on the Exceptions Clause, courts and scholars must first have a robust understanding of how constitutional amendments impact and alter provisions of the existing Constitution. Part I of this Article thus begins by describing the impact of constitutional amendment, arguing that amendments—very few of which refer to the specific provisions of the Constitution they are meant to change—are not simply additions. They can (and generally do) alter the meaning of the original Constitution, including the Exceptions Clause. Building from the text and history of the Constitution and the amendments themselves, this Part argues that properly interpreting amendments requires courts to identify what, if anything, an amendment “amends. ” Part I concludes by suggesting how courts and scholars can better accomplish that interpretive task. The second Part of the Article applies this amendment theory to the Exceptions Clause, analyzing the degree to which subsequent amendments have implicitly altered the power it gives Congress over federal jurisdiction. Although scholars have long sensed the existence of internal and external “constraints” on congressional power under the Clause, none have systematically incorporated a robust theory of constitutional amendment to explain these limitations. By doing so, this Article thickens and supports the external constraints theory of Congress’s Exceptions Clause power, and may help shed light on two of legal academia’s central quests: clarifying the meaning of constitutional amendment and finding limits on the Exceptions Clause...|$|R

Advocates of the <b>amendment</b> <b>charged</b> that the political pressure on legislators {{on the part of}} Governor Deval Patrick and legislative leaders included job offers and trading votes on other issues. Opponents of the amendment cast the vote as one of conscience and personal rather than political lobbying.

40|$|Particle size {{analysis}} {{was carried out}} on the microaggregate fraction (< 53 µm) of spent mushroom compost (SMC) amended pyritic lead-zinc tailings using laser diffraction. A randomized factorial greenhouse trial of six-month duration was established using tailings originating from the surface (20 to 30 cm) of the partially vegetated 76 -ha tailings management facility (TMF) in Gortmore, Silvermines, Co. Tipperary, Ireland. SMC was incorporated at application rates of 0, 50, 100, 200 and 400 t ha- 1 and Lolium perenne sown {{at a rate of}} 200 kg ha- 1. Following trial dismantlement, the effects of SMC treatment on the microaggregate fraction of the tailings was investigated using optical laser diffraction on a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 ®. At SMC applications of 200 t ha- 1 and 400 t ha- 1 an increase in clay dispersion was observed as represented by low d(0. 10) values, while a reduction in clay dispersion was noted at SMC applications of 50 t ha- 1 and 100 t ha- 1. Furthermore, microaggregate stability generally decreased with increasing SMC application as noted by a decrease in d(4, 3) values. This is probably explained by the change in surface <b>charge</b> following SMC <b>amendment,</b> the low clay concentration and the mineralogy of the lead zinc-tailings, all of which did not prove favorable in the stabilization of the microaggregates present in pyritic lead-zinc tailings. Laser diffraction gave rapid, reliable and consistent results {{and for the most part}} showed a shift in particle size distribution between each SMC treatment...|$|R
