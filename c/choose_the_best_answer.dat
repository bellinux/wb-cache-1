5000|$|There is a {{trade-off}} between {{the amount of}} time spent figuring out the best query plan and the quality of the choice; the optimizer may not <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>answer</b> on its own. Different qualities of database management systems have different ways of balancing these two. Cost-based query optimizers evaluate the resource footprint of various query plans and use this as the basis for plan selection. These assign an estimated [...] "cost" [...] to each possible query plan, and choose the plan with the smallest cost. Costs are used to estimate the runtime cost of evaluating the query, in terms of the number of I/O operations required, CPU path length, amount of disk buffer space, disk storage service time, and interconnect usage between units of parallelism, and other factors determined from the data dictionary. The set of query plans examined is formed by examining the possible access paths (e.g., primary index access, secondary index access, full file scan) and various relational table join techniques (e.g., merge join, hash join, product join). The search space can become quite large depending on the complexity of the SQL query. There are two types of optimization. These consist of logical optimization—which generates a sequence of relational algebra to solve the query—and physical optimization—which is used to determine the means of carrying out each operation.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{effectively}} and efficiently finding the global optimum of a function by using evolu-tionary algorithms is current and pertinent, {{and two of the}} evolutionary techniques that have received significant attention in the literature are Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Differential Evolution (DE), as well as their numerous variants. One way of taking advantage of the many good PSO and DE variant algorithms that have appeared in the literature is to run them all for a particular optimization problem and <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>answer</b> provided. This approach, referred to as the Naive Approach (NA) is time consuming. In this paper, we are using the naive approach with a suite of algorithms for each function minimization problem and we run the algorithms, in the suite, for a specific number of function evaluations (typically much smaller than the number of function evaluations needed for each specific algorithm to converge to a solution) and decide, using appropriate performance measures of merit, which one of these algorithms will continue running until convergence; the rest of the algorithms, deemed as algorithms that will eventually produce inferior solutions, are aborted. We refer to our methodology, for obvious reasons, as the Winner-Take-All (WTA) methodology. Using this methodology we introduce WTA algorithmic variants that are efficient and effective solvers of global optimization problems.

40|$|Abstract Collaborative {{questioning}} and answering (CQA) {{sites such as}} Stack Overflow are the placement in which community members can ask and answer questions as well as interact with questions and answers. A question may receive multiple answers, and only one may be selected as the best answer, which means that this answer is more suitable for the given question. For the purpose of effective information retrieval, it will be beneficial to automatically predict and select the best answer. This thesis carried out and presented a study to evaluate content quality in CQA site by using logistic regression and features extracted from questions, answers and users’ information. By reviewing previous researches, all features {{which can be used}} to evaluate and predict the quality of content in the research case were identified. Stack Overflow was chosen as the research case and a sample of questions and answers has been extracted for further analysis. The human rated question score was done with the assistance of three people working in the field of information technology. Various features from questions, answers, and owners’ information were modelled and trained into classifiers to <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>answer</b> or high quality question. The results indicate that the models built in this research for evaluating answer quality have high predictive ability and strong robustness. While the models for evaluating question quality have low predictive ability in this study. In addition, it is demonstrated that several features from questions, answers, and owners’ information can be valuable component in evaluating and predicting content quality, such as owner’s reputation points, and questions’ or answer score, but human rated question score has no significant influence on evaluating answer quality. This research has contributions to science and implications for practice. For example, one main contribution is that based on the models built in this study, CQA sites can automatically suggest to their users the best answers, which is a time-saving solution for users looking for help from CQA sites...|$|E
40|$|We {{have seen}} several {{randomized}} approximation algorithms before. Recall {{that for the}} MAX-CUT and MAX- 3 SAT problems we proved that choosing any solution uniformly at random gives a constant factor approximation in the expectation. For MAX-CUT the approximation factor was 2. For MAX- 3 SAT, a random assignment of truth values to a variable satisfies a given clause with probability 7 8. In the case of MAX- 3 SAT, {{it is possible to}} derandomize the algorithm and get a deterministic performance guarantee of 8 7. Furthermore, this approximation is tight as {{it has been shown that}} finding a better approximation is NP-Hard. Today, we will look at two other problems where flipping coins allows us to get a good approximation in the expectation. Specifically, we will be looking at VERTEX-COVER and RENT-OR-BUY. In each of these we will have to be more clever with our randomness than we were for MAX-CUT and MAX- 3 SAT. 11. 2 Two flavors of Performance Guarantee for Randomized Approximations In many cases, we may find that we desire a randomized algorithm that performs well with high probability rather than simply in the expectation. In such cases we want an algorithm A with a guarantee of the form A(I) ≤ ρOP T (11. 2. 1) with high probability (on the order of 1 − 1 poly(n)) for all instance I. In general, approximation algorithms that do well in the expectation can be converted to algorithms that do well with high probability. That is, given ɛ> 0, it possible to convert algorithm A with guarantee into an algorithm A ′ with performance guarantee E[A(I) ] ≤ ρOP T (11. 2. 2) A ′ (I) ≤ ρ(1 + ɛ) OP T (11. 2. 3) with high probability. The method is simply to run the algorithm that does well in the expectation several times and <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>answer.</b> Let t be the number of times we run the algorithm to get a good answer.

40|$|Shifting the {{emphasis}} from {{a model to}} a modelling task, which involves both a computer model and a modeller, we ask what makes a problem complex. We propose that a modelling task {{can be seen as}} a set of questions-and-answers, nested at multiple levels. The role of the modeller then lies in posing <b>the</b> questions and <b>choosing</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> procedure to <b>answer</b> them, while the role of the model lies in answering the questions, via algorithmic, thus logically simple, procedures. Within this framework, complexity is broadly related to the number of question-answer levels involved in the process and the nature of the questions posed. Addressing this complexity depends crucially on the ingenuity and creativity of the modeller, both of which are fundamentally nonalgorithmic processes. This may lead to a view of complexity which is no more observer-independent, nor computable, but rather accounts for both historical and cultural development, as well as for the context of the problem at hand. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the use and {{acceptance}} of information technology (IT) in Slovenian public healthcare institutions. To our knowledge, this is the first national survey to estimate the willingness of employees to welcome new technology into their work routine. Methods: The survey was based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) methodology, according to which we designed a questionnaire. It consisted of 37 closed-ended questions and participants were asked to <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> single <b>best</b> <b>answer</b> to each. Out of one hundred public healthcare institutions across the country, 52 replied. We received 1, 575 validly completed questionnaires. The results were statistically analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression. Statistically significant value of p was set at < 0. 05. Results: The data revealed a high degree of acceptance and use of IT among healthcare professionals. Health IT use showed the highest degree of coincidence with previous IT experience (p< 0. 001). Respondents graded highly the usefulness of IT (4. 50 of 5) and their own IT skills (4. 28). They were slightly less content with the performance of their workplace IT and the availability of technical help in case of difficulty (both 3. 57). Conclusions: The results show a positive attitude toward IT among Slovenian healthcare professionals. These findings are especially relevant in view of the fact that all types of healthcare professionals from all kinds of public healthcare institutions across the country were included in the survey...|$|R
