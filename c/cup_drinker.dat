40|$|Detailed {{information}} on the pigs 2 ̆ 7 temporal drinking patterns is essential when delivering water based health products {{because there is a}} risk that not all pigs will visit the drinker adequately and hence, may not have received sufficient vaccine or antibiotics required to protect the animal. Limited research has evaluated drinking visits and water disappearance in nursery pigs. Recent work has begun to investigate the pig to water resource ratio and the placement and type of water delivery systems.;This thesis covers the areas of: (1) drinking behavior of seven week old pigs when water is either withheld for a period of 15 h or provided ad libitum and (2) drinking behavior, aggressive interactions, water bowl preference, and performance measures between seven week old nursery pigs when provided a 1 : 25, 1 : 12, or 1 : 8 drinker to pig ratio.;In the first study a total of 194 seven week old PIC (USA) pigs, weighing 22. 98 +/- 5. 38 kg were housed in single sex pens in a commercial nursery facility. Two treatments were compared; treatment one; withheld (WH; n = 4) pigs did not have access to water for 15 h and treatment two, control (CONT; n = 4) pigs had continuous ad libitum access to water. Drinking behavior was recorded from 0700 to 1300 h over two consecutive days. The acquisition of drinking behavior (defined as the pig having its head in the nipple-cup drinker for 5 s or longer) was obtained. Total number of visits, visit lengths and water disappearance were analyzed.;This study found that manipulating water access for a period of 15 h affected the number and length of drinking visits to the nipple <b>cup</b> <b>drinker</b> over a 6 h period, with WH pigs spending longer at the water resource and visiting more often than their CONT counterparts. Upon breaking each hour down respectively the differences (P = 0. 0001) were noted in the first hour (0700) after water was restored with the control group making fewer visits (1. 96 vs. 4. 46 +/- 0. 26) and spending less time (18. 08 +/- 4. 04 vs. 64. 44 +/- 4. 02) at the nipple <b>cup</b> <b>drinker</b> when compared to the withholding group. After 60 min of water restoration there were no differences in the number of visits or length of time spent at the nipple <b>cup</b> <b>drinker</b> between treatments. In addition, water disappearance over the observational period was greater for pigs that had water withheld compared to pigs that were in the control treatment.;In the second study a total of 225 crossbred (21 +/- 4 d) gilts weighing 5. 38 +/- 2. 65 kg were used. Nine pens were used for behavioral and performance measures (average daily gain [ADG]), and three treatments were compared. Treatment one (TRT 1; n = 3) was defined as one water bowl drinker per pen. Treatment two (TRT 2; n = 3) was defined as two water bowl drinkers per pen and treatment three (TRT 3; n = 3) was defined as three water bowl drinkers per pen. Drinking behavior, aggressive interactions and water bowl preference were recorded from 0700 to 1300 h over two consecutive days. The acquisition of drinking behavior (defined as the pig having its head in the water bowl drinker for 5 s or longer) was obtained. The total number of drinking visits and visit lengths, number of aggressive interactions and duration, water bowl preference, in regards to the length of time spent at each drinker, and performance measures were analyzed.;When offered more places to drink, pigs visited the water bowl drinker more often (P = 0. 0209) which tended (P = 0. 06) to increase ADG in nursery aged pigs. In addition, pigs displayed a water bowl drinker preference with the alley location being the least favored. Additional {{information on}} placement of key resources within a pen to enhance the drinking behavior for the pig is a useful tool for the swine industry and stakeholders when designing water delivery systems to enhance pig well-being and overall profitability.;Water functions, water quality, and water requirements are all essential to the well-being of the individual pig. It has been stated by numerous authors that water is the 2 ̆ 2 forgotten nutrient. 2 ̆ 2 Yet, information regarding water requirements for all stages of pig production, the specifics to optimize water delivery to the pig, water resource location within the home pen and the ratios of pigs to the drinking resource are to date limited. This research provides new information on water management manipulation and water bowl placement within a nursery pen that may affect the drinking patterns of the individual pig...|$|E

40|$|Distributions {{of lesser}} mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), in litter of a {{compacted}} earth floor broiler house in southeastern Queensland, Australia, were studied over two flocks. Larvae were the predominant stage recorded. Significantly low densities occurred in open locations and under <b>drinker</b> <b>cups</b> where chickens had complete access, whereas high densities were found under feed pans and along house edges where chicken access was restricted. For each flock, lesser mealworm numbers increased at all locations {{over the first}} 14 d, especially under feed pans and along house edges, peaking at 26 d and then declining over the final 28 d. A life stage profile per flock was devised that consisted of the following: beetles emerge from the earth floor {{at the beginning of}} each flock, and females lay eggs, producing larvae that peak in numbers at 3 wk; after a further 3 to 4 wk, larvae leave litter to pupate in the earth floor, and beetles then emerge by the end of the flock time. Removing old litter from the brooder section at the end of a flock did not greatly reduce mealworm numbers over the subsequent flock, but it seemed to prevent numbers increasing, while an increase in numbers in the grow-out section was recorded after reusing litter. Areas under feed pans and along house edges accounted for 5 % of the total house area, but approximately half the estimated total number of lesser mealworms in the broiler house occurred in these locations. The results of this study will be used to determine optimal deployment of site-specific treatments for lesser mealworm control...|$|R
40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{effective}} means {{to clean and}} disinfect affected premises is needed by the poultry industry. Commercially available foaming disinfectants and cleaners applied via a compressed air foam system (CAFS) {{may be used to}} significantly reduce aerobic bacteria in a commercial caged layer complex. Using a variety of agricultural products against bacterial species may also provide information on which products are most efficacious against specific microorganisms on cage floors. In the first study, six field trials were conducted to evaluate current industry cleaning and disinfection protocols and the proposed CAFS application. A commercially available chlorinated alkaline cleaner (CHL/ALK) in trials 1 & 2 was applied by CAFS to one half of the house, and {{the other half of the}} house was not treated. The entire house was then washed with a high pressure water rinse (HPWR). A commercially available peroxyacetic acid (PAA) in trials 3 & 4 or a 14 % glutaraldehyde (HI GLUT) / 2. 5 % quaternary ammonia (QAC) blended disinfectant in trials 5 & 6 was applied by CAFS to one half of a washed house. The remainder of each house was treated with 7 % (LO GLUT) / 26 % QAC, which was the spray application applied to cages by the integrator. Environmental swabs of <b>drinker</b> <b>cups</b> and cage floors were collected pre and post treatment to determine if aerobic bacteria levels were reduced. The HPWR and the CHL/ALK treatments did not consistently reduce aerobic bacteria on treated surfaces. Significant differences were observed with each of the CAFS applications of the PAA, HI GLUT/QAC, and LO GLUT/QAC product. The objective of the second study was to determine the efficacy of commonly used products on soiled layer cages. Trial one was conducted in a small layer barn at the Texas A&M University Poultry Science Research, Teaching, and Extension Center. Trial two was performed at a commercial pullet house. In each trial, treatments were applied by a garden sprayer and six samples per treatment were collected. All products were mixed according to the manufacturer?s recommendations. Treatments consisted of a negative control, a low pressure water rinse (LPWR, garden hose), a high pressure water rinse (HPWR, pressure washer), a soap, a chlorinated alkaline cleaner, a QAC, a glutaraldehyde, a peroxyacetic acid, a phenolic, a potassium peroxymonosulfate, a hydrogen peroxide, and a QAC/glutaraldehyde blend product. Swabs of cage floors were collected post treatment to determine if bacterial loads were reduced as compared to the appropriate controls. Aerobic bacteria, coliforms, Staphylococcus spp., and Pseudomonas ssp. were enumerated to evaluate the efficacy of the treatments. Aerobic bacterial colonization was significantly reduced by the oxidizer, peroxyacetic acid, aldehyde, and QAC disinfectants in trial one and by all seven disinfectants in trial two against the HPWR control. No treatment, in the first trial, significantly decreased coliforms or Staphylococcus spp. when compared to controls of nothing and the HPWR. However, reduction (P < 0. 05) of coliforms and Staphylococcus spp. were observed with all disinfectants in trial two. The aldehyde and QAT disinfectant products in trial one, and all disinfectant products except the hydrogen peroxide and QAT/glutaraldehyde compound in trial two significantly reduced the levels of Pseudomonas spp. These data suggest that characteristics of cleaning and disinfection regimens can vary significantly...|$|R
40|$|In Australia, {{the lesser}} mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), {{is a common}} insect pest of earth floor broiler houses, where it often occurs in large numbers in the bedding {{material}} or litter that is used on the floors. Lesser mealworms are reservoirs for several avian pathogens, parasites and food borne diseases. In addition, larvae damage broiler house structures by actively tunnelling into insulation and earth floors. Despite being a common and ubiquitous broiler house pest in Australia, until now, little was known of its ecology in earth floor broiler houses or its susceptibility to registered broiler house insecticides. To determine {{the factors that influence}} their localised abundance and distribution in litter, populations of lesser mealworm in several earth-floor broiler houses in sub-tropical Queensland were intensively sampled, experiments were undertaken and life tables constructed. Lesser mealworm larvae were the predominant stage recorded in all litter samples. Life table parameters used stage durations based on a mean broiler house temperature of 31. 3 °C. Within the broiler houses, substantial horizontal movement of larvae in litter to under feed pans was recorded and this behaviour was supported by life table analyses, which showed atypical lesser mealworm survivorship, suggesting movement by all larval ages. This movement results in large and significant aggregations of larvae under feed pans and along house edges, where chicken access is restricted. Significantly lower larval densities occurred in open locations and under <b>drinker</b> <b>cups,</b> where chickens had complete access. Small larvae appeared to aggregate predominately {{at the beginning of the}} flock but continued to move during most of the flock time. In addition, the experimental manipulations in open areas of the broiler house showed that lesser mealworms substantially increased in number inside caged areas without feed pans and under uncaged empty feed pans. Lesser mealworms under similar empty feed pans but enclosed with metal barriers did not increase in the same manner; these barriers significantly restricted their movement. Aggregated populations of lesser mealworms were found to be localised and independent of chicken-feed, manure, and the normally high adult beetle numbers that occur under permanent existing feed pans. Total broiler bird weight in the brooder section during the flock time was considered a driving factor for larval movement, and together with relatively high litter temperatures, a potential source of mortality across larval stages. At almost all types of locations within a broiler house, including experimental treatment locations, numbers of lesser mealworms typically increased over the first 14 d of the flock time, especially in more protected areas such as under feed pans and along house edges, peaked at ≈ 26 d, and then declined over the remainder of the flock time. In these protected areas or refuges, larvae peaked in numbers, and then left the litter environment to pupate in the earth floor prior to the end of the flock time. This behaviour seemed unrelated to density as the same temporal pattern of abundance was observed under pans within metal barriers, where much fewer insects occurred. It was not observed in uncaged open areas where chickens had complete access. As larvae move away from chickens to refuges, it is likely that populations fail to establish in open areas, but fluctuate in numbers and suffer high rates of mortality. Therefore a typical life stage profile in earth floor broiler houses consists of beetles that emerge from the earth floor at the start of each flock time, lay large numbers of eggs that produce larvae that peak in numbers at ≈ 21 d, and after a further 21 - 28 d leave the litter and pupate in the earth floor. These pupae produce adult beetles that begin to emerge prior to the end of the flock time. Removing and replacing litter in the brooder section at the completion of a flock time appeared to inhibit rises in numbers of lesser mealworms over the subsequent flock in the brooder section. In contrast, reusing litter in the grow-out section caused an increase in lesser mealworm numbers in the grow-out over the subsequent flock time. Areas under feed pans and along house edges accounted for 5 % of the total house area, but approximately half the estimated total number of lesser mealworms in the broiler house occurred in these locations. Because a high proportion of larvae move to under pan locations and aggregate, this behaviour could be exploited to better manage lesser mealworms by targeting applications of residual control agents at the commencement of the flock to areas under feed pans, which could maximize the efficiency of these agents, and in doing so, reduce the overall quantity of insecticide required to treat a broiler house. The most common practice used for management of lesser mealworm is the treatment of broiler house floors or bedding with insecticides. In Australia fenitrothion, cyfluthrin and spinosad are currently registered for broiler house application, and another insecticide, γ-cyhalothrin, is under consideration. Overall, the most commonly used insecticide throughout eastern Australia is the pyrethroid, cyfluthrin. Because of control failures using this chemical, resistance to cyfluthrin was suspected in Australian broiler farm populations of lesser mealworm. Consequently the responses of several field populations of beetles collected from broiler farms in different Australian states and an insecticide-susceptible reference population to cyfluthrin, spinosad and γ-cyhalothrin were measured in topical application bioassays. In addition, the susceptibility of six Australian broiler house beetle populations and the insecticide susceptible population to several pyrethroids (cyfluthrin, β-cyfluthrin, γ-cyhalothrin & deltamethrin) was measured to determine patterns of cross resistance. The importance of metabolic mechanisms of resistance in these field populations was investigated using similar assays and the synergist piperonyl butoxide. Beetle populations from eastern Australia were first tested with cyfluthrin and resistance (resistance ratios of up to 22 -fold at the LC 50) was found in almost all of them; with the degree of resistance in a given population directly proportional to the number of cyfluthrin applications it had received. Dose-mortality data showed that 0. 0007 % cyfluthrin (the LC 99. 9 of the susceptible population) could be used as a convenient discriminating dose to identify resistant populations. In addition, comparisons of cyfluthrin LC 50 values of three broiler populations and a susceptible population, collected and then assayed over a four year interval, indicated that values from all three broiler populations had increased over this time. For spinosad, comparisons of dose-response curves showed that all populations, including the insecticide-susceptible population, were equivalent in their response to spinosad, indicating no pre-existing spinosad resistance. Two of these field populations, including a resistant reference population, had confirmed cyfluthrin/fenitrothion-resistance, but showed no cross-resistance to spinosad. A discriminating concentration of 3 % spinosad (just above the highest recorded LC 99. 9 value of 2. 45 %) was set to separate resistant and susceptible individuals. For γ-cyhalothrin, baseline studies of beetle populations from most Australian states indicated that it was roughly twice as toxic as cyfluthrin, with a discriminating concentration of 0. 005 % γ-cyhalothrin chosen to detect any future changes in susceptibility. These same beetle populations were tested with the cyfluthrin discriminating dose to identify possible cross-resistance. Across all populations, there was a significant linear relationship between the γ-cyhalothrin LC 50 value and mortality induced by the cyfluthrin discriminating dose. In addition, repeat testing and regression analysis of specific beetle populations to γ-cyhalothrin showed that topical application was a very reliable and repeatable testing method. The γ-cyhalothrin study suggested that cyfluthrin can confer cross-resistance to γ-cyhalothrin in A. diaperinus, but the magnitude of this resistance is not predictable. The susceptibility of beetle populations to four pyrethroids with and without piperonyl butoxide showed that almost all populations, when compared to the reference susceptible population, demonstrated very low susceptibility to cyfluthrin, with some reduced susceptibility to β-cyfluthrin, deltamethrin and γ-cyhalothrin; cross-resistance patterns varied considerably between populations. Adding piperonyl butoxide had no effect on the susceptibility of the susceptible population to any of the insecticides, but it consistently increased the susceptibility of each of the five cyfluthrin-resistant populations to cyfluthrin, β-cyfluthrin and γ-cyhalothrin. The addition of piperonyl butoxide to deltamethrin had inconsistent effects on susceptibility. In general, adding piperonyl butoxide to the four pyrethroids did not completely restore susceptibility to these compounds in resistant populations, indicating the presence of other resistance mechanisms in addition to microsomal-monooxygenase and esterase based metabolic resistance mechanisms. The relative importance of these metabolic resistance mechanisms in each beetle population varied widely between pyrethroids, and the future addition of piperonyl butoxide to these pyrethroids might not necessarily improve their efficacy in the field. Following the laboratory toxicity testing of cyfluthrin and spinosad, field efficacy assessments of these two insecticides and diatomaceous earth, were made on two farms in south eastern Queensland. Diatomaceous earth is known to have insecticidal properties so it was chosen to assess its potential as a natural litter treatment on one farm. Insecticide treatments|$|R
