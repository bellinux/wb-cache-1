40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{investigations of}} the performance of vertical refrigerated display cabinets. Such cabinets are in widespread use and account for a considerable proportion of the energy used in shops. The open front is important for the shop-owner, who wants the chilled items in the cabinet to be well exposed and easily accessible. The purpose of the work has been to analyse the energy flows in display cabinets and subsequently analysing the possibilities to reducing the cabinets' energy requirements while retaining or improving their performance. The work has involved controlled investigations in a climate chamber in order to determine how the ambient climatic conditions and other factors affect energy use. The results show that the energy requirement of a display cabinet is linearly proportional to the difference in specific enthalpy between that of the ambient air and that of the cold air in the cabinet. This means that the cooling power requirement for any arbitrary climate can be determined from measurements of the energy requirements of two different ambient climates. An analysis of energy flows shows that infiltration provides the greatest inward heat leakage in a display <b>cabinet.</b> <b>Radiation</b> and illumination also have a relatively substantial effect in comparison with other possible heat inputs, as they act on the most poorly cooled products in the cabinet. The overall energy requirement of a display cabinet is determined by the ambient climate and the temperature of the warmest item in the cabinet, which therefore in turn determines the mean temperature level in the entire cabinet. Results from experimental measurements and CFD calculations show that the performance of an open vertical display cabinet with cold air blown in through the back is affected by how it is loaded and by how the perforations in the back-plate are arranged. The conclusion is that cold air input through the back-plate is not the best method of cooling the foodstuff packages, as the cold air is supplied where the need for cooling is least. The air curtain is required to provide good enclosure, and also to cool the foodstuffs {{at the front of the}} shelves, all with the least input of energy. The results from the modelling show that it is not possible to achieve the same efficiency and function with air curtains having the same height/width ratio but with different heights. If the air curtain is to cool items at the front of shelves, while at the same time being stable, a shorter air curtain is more efficient than a longer air curtain for the same height/width ratio. The overall conclusion is therefore that a single long air curtain should be replaced by a number of shorter air curtains, and that a thick air curtain is more efficient than a thin air curtain...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a modular packaging system for logistics {{that can be}} reconfigured into internal outfitting for a lunar outpost, including desks, chairs, partitions, <b>cabinets,</b> and <b>radiation</b> shielding. Logistics include clothes, equipment, food, and other consumables needed to sustain the crew {{for the duration of}} the mission. A significant mass penalty is required for the packaging and handling of logistics for re-supply of short to long-term space missions that must be brought out of the gravity well on a launch vehicle. Once the supplies have been exhausted, the packaging material is typically of no further use and is discarded. If a scheme can be developed that reuses the logistics packaging, the mass penalty can be reduced. In this research, a modular packaging system has been devised as a kit-of-parts that can be used for both handling logistics supplies, and then reconfigured into desks, chairs, partitions, <b>cabinets,</b> and <b>radiation</b> shielding. The system is derived from a standard International Space Station (ISS) -type Cargo Transfer Bag (CTB), using soft, unfoldable box-like containers with stiff metal inserts. The empty hydrogen-impregnated CTBs can be used as-is for cabinets, opened up for use as partitions, or draped over the habitat as layers of radiation shielding. Stiff metal inserts can be reconfigured into desks and other useful outfitting...|$|R
40|$|Disclosed is {{an image}} {{recording}} apparatus (5) for automatically generating a computed tomographic image of a component (7). The image recording apparatus (5) comprises a radiation source (10) {{which is designed to}} emit electromagnetic radiation (35), wherein the electromagnetic radiation (35) has a radiation path (40) which comprises the component (7) or at least a section of the component (7) and a radiation detector (15). The image recording apparatus (5) further has the radiation detector (15) which is designed to receive the electromagnetic radiation (35) of the radiation source (10) and to detect the image of the component (7) or the image of the section of the component (7) which is in the radiation path (40). The radiation source (10) and the radiation detector (15) are located in a <b>radiation</b> protection <b>cabinet</b> (20) which is designed to shield the electromagnetic radiation (35) inside the <b>radiation</b> protection <b>cabinet</b> (20) from the environment. The image recording apparatus (5) further comprises a robot (25) located outside the <b>radiation</b> protection <b>cabinet</b> (20), wherein a robotic arm (45) of the robot (25) is designed to guide the component (7) into the <b>radiation</b> protection <b>cabinet</b> (20) through an opening (50) in the <b>radiation</b> protection <b>cabinet</b> (20). A <b>radiation</b> escape prevention device (30) is designed to prevent radiation (35) escaping through the opening (50) when the component (7) is guided into the <b>radiation</b> protection <b>cabinet</b> (20) through the opening (50) by the robotic arm (45) ...|$|R
40|$|The Stationary Low Power Reactor No. 1 is a three Mw {{boiling water}} reactor {{designed}} to demonstrate the feasibility of a nuclear reactor to supply electrical power and space heat for remote sites. In addition to performance evaluation the facility provides training for military personnel. The reactor was operated for 1159 hr during the quarter for a total core burnup of 20. 3 %. Power generation was 103. 7 Mwd for a total power accumulation of 466. 9 Mwd. Eight malfunctions occurred during the quarter for a total unscheduled downtime of 40 hr 44 min, As a result of malfunctions, aluminum keys will be installed on the control rod drives, instrument well covers were removed, and an order has been placed for a station auxiliaries breaker with a higher temperature rating. Data were taken on seven tests during the quarter. Four of these {{are expected to be}} completed during the next quarter. All equipment items on order for the SL- 1 power extrapolation expansion program are scheduled to be delivered before June 15, 1960. Although condenser dampers and damper controls, process instrumentation, equipment <b>cabinets,</b> and the <b>radiation</b> monitoring equipment have not yet been ordered, construction will not be delayed. The two tie-ins to the existing reactor piping which were required have been made. The engineering and decontamination buildings are nearing completion and will be ready for occupancy in early May. An SL-l operational cost analysis for March of electrical power generated, based on military personnel only, indicated a mil rate of 107. (auth...|$|R
