Christ is naked except for a transparent veil, with some of his pubic hair visible.

His arms strain under the weight of his upper body, and in his final agony, his jaw has fallen slack; his mouth is open with his teeth exposed in the grimace of death. In the mid-ground, {{at the base of the}} cross, Longinus, on horseback, wearing a fur-trimmed hat and green tunic, guided by an assistant, stretches to pierce Jesus' side with a lance, as deep-red blood pours from the wound. To the right of Longinus, a mostly obscured Stephaton holds high a sponge soaked with vinegar on the tip of a reed.|$|R

From ten female Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs (five 1 day aged and ten 90 days aged) the Authors have utilized the vertebral column divided in cer-vical, thoracic, lumbar, sacro-coccygeal blocks. For light microscopy 10 µm cross seri-ally cut sections were stained with toluidine blue and a modification of Heidenhain method. For electron microscopy ultrathin <b>cross</b> sections <b>stained</b> with 2 % uranyl acetate and lead citrate were utilized. Cylindrical ependymal cells lined the central canal {{for most of its}} extent at P 1 (new-born subjects). At P 90 (adult subjects) these cells became cubical. At P 1 the ependymal canal, which was oval at cervical level, showed a slit aspect from thoracic and lumbar levels to sacral one. At P 90 the central canal maintained its oval shape. At the level of the terminal ventricle of the medullar cone the wall was reduced to thin layer formed by both ependymal cells and tanycytes (more evident in P 1), whose basal processes divid-ed bundles of axons and contributed to the formation of the stratum marginale gliae.

METHODS: Neonatal C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were divided randomly into three groups: normoxic control group, physiological saline injection of OIR group and adiponectin injection of OIR group. The mice of the latter two groups were exposed to 75 %± 2 % oxygen from 7 d(P 7) ～P 12 to induced OIR. Recombinant APN(rAPN) was injected intraperitoneally(i. p., 3. 0 μg/g) in a mice model of OIR from P 7 ～P 15. Another set of mice model of OIR were received a similar treatment with physiological saline. All eyes were collected at P 17.
