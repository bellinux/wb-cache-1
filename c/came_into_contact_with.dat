5|$|Hamilton's birthplace on {{the island}} of Nevis had a large Jewish community, constituting one quarter of Charlestown's white {{population}} by the 1720s. He <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> Jews on a regular basis; as a small boy, he was tutored by a Jewish schoolmistress, and had learned to recite the Ten Commandments in the original Hebrew.|$|E

5|$|As rain {{continued}} to fall, the slightly acidic rainwater dissolved the limestone. As limestone wore away, the groundwater <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the land surface {{and created a}} massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, weathering of the limestone created slight valleys and plateaus in some areas. These plateaus rise and fall only a few inches, but on the subtle South Florida topography these small variations affect both {{the flow of water}} and the types of vegetation that can take hold.|$|E

5|$|Conroy {{effectively}} barred Victoria {{from anyone}} other than the Duchess or his relatives and the princess was prevented from becoming close to her extended family. The enforced isolation meant the only companions of her own age whom she frequently <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> were Conroy's daughters, who included Victoire, a girl a few months older than Victoria. Victoria {{does not appear to}} have been fond of either Conroy sister as there is little positive comment in her personal journals.|$|E
5|$|In 1787, he <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> Thomas Clarkson and a {{group of}} anti-slave-trade activists, {{including}} Granville Sharp, Hannah More and Charles Middleton. They persuaded Wilberforce to take on the cause of abolition, and he soon became one of the leading English abolitionists. He headed the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for twenty years until the passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807.|$|E
5|$|Memories of {{the sack}} of Rome by Celtic tribes from Gaul in 390/387 BC, {{had been made}} into a legendary account that was taught to each {{generation}} of Roman youth, were still prominent despite their historical distance. In 121 BC, Rome <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the Celtic tribes of the Allobroges and the Arverni, both of which they defeated with apparent ease in the First Battle of Avignon near the Rhone river and the Second Battle of Avignon, the same year.|$|E

5|$|After {{the liberation}} of Belgium in September 1944, there was a boom of new {{magazines}} for the youth, both in French and Dutch. Many of those tried to mix American comics with local artists. Vandersteen worked in these early years for countless publications. He continued publishing in Bravo, with the medieval gags of Lancelot. Having moved to the suburbs of Brussels to avoid the bombardments of Antwerp, he <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> some French language editors. French language magazines he contributed to included Franc Jeu, Perce-Neige, and Le Petit Monde. Two of the comics he created for Franc Jeu were also published in albums. By 1947, all these magazines had disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano {{completed}} his first {{studies at the}} San Carlos school, where he learned Latin, philosophy, logic, physics, metaphysics, and literature; he graduated in 1786. Domingo had sufficient success as merchant to send his two sons Francisco and Manuel to study in Europe. He expected them to study commerce, but Manuel decided to study law. Belgrano was so successful and attained such prestige that Pope Pius VI allowed him to study forbidden literature, even books deemed as heretical, excepting only the astrological and obscene books. In this way he <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> authors like Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Filangieri, who were forbidden in Spain.|$|E
5|$|Composite bows {{were soon}} adopted and adapted by civilizations who <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> nomads, {{such as the}} Chinese, Assyrian, and Egyptian. Several {{composite}} bows {{were found in the}} tomb of Tutankhamun, who died in 1324 BCE. Composite bows (and chariots) are known in China from at least the Shang Dynasty (1700–1100 BCE). We have strong indications to believe that Bronze Age Greek Cultures like the Minoans and the Mycenaeans were using composite bows in a large scale. By the 4th century BCE, chariotry had ceased to have military importance, replaced by cavalry everywhere (except in Britannia where charioteers are not recorded as using bows).|$|E

5|$|Eusebio Joaquín González {{was born}} on August 14, 1896 in Colotlán, Jalisco. At a young age, he joined the Constitutional Army during the Mexican Revolution. While he was on leave in 1920, he met Elisa Flores, whom he later married. While {{stationed}} {{in the state of}} Coahuila in 1926, he <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> Saulo and Silas, two ascetic preachers from the Iglesia Cristiana Espiritual. Their teachings forbade their followers to keep good hygiene and wear regular clothes. After being baptized by the two itinerant preachers, González resigned from the army, and along with his wife became domestic workers to the two preachers.|$|E
5|$|Hertfordshire. She was the {{daughter}} of Richard Jennings (or Jenyns), a Member of Parliament, and Frances Thornhurst; her paternal grandfather was Sir John Jennings, father, by his wife Alice Spencer, of an extraordinarily large family. Her uncle (Martin Lister) was a prominent naturalist. Richard Jennings <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> James, Duke of York (the future James II, brother of King Charles II), in 1663, during negotiations for the recovery of an estate in Kent (Agney Court) that had been the property of his mother-in-law, Susan Lister (nee Temple). James's first impressions were favourable, and in 1664 Sarah’s sister, Frances, was appointed maid of honour to the Duchess of York, Anne Hyde.|$|E
5|$|In 121 BC, Rome <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> two Celtic tribes (from {{a region}} in modern France), {{both of which}} they {{defeated}} with apparent ease. The Cimbrian War (113–101 BC) was a far more serious affair than the earlier clashes of 121 BC. The Germanic tribes of the Cimbri and the Teutons migrated from northern Europe into Rome's northern territories, and clashed with Rome and her allies. At the Battle of Aquae Sextiae and the Battle of Vercellae both tribes were virtually annihilated, which ended the threat.|$|E

5|$|In May 1923 {{he visited}} {{continental}} Europe, journeying to the museums in Lausanne, Bern and Zürich to study their prehistoric artefact collections; that year {{he became a}} member of the Royal Anthropological Institute. In 1925, the Institute offered him one of the only archaeological jobs then available in Britain, and he became their librarian, in doing so cementing connections with scholars across Europe. This job meant that he <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> many of Britain's archaeologists, of whom there were relatively few during the 1920s; he developed a great friendship with O. G. S. Crawford, the Archaeological Officer to the Ordnance Survey, influencing the latter's move toward socialism and Marxism.|$|E
5|$|Lê Duẩn {{was born}} as Lê Văn Nhuận in Bich La village, Triệu Đông, Triệu Phong, Quảng Trị Province on 7 April 1907 (although some sources cite 1908) to a poor family with 5 children. Locals from his {{generation}} say that Duan's parents were metal scrap collectors and blacksmiths. The {{son of a}} railway clerk, he became active in revolutionary politics as a young man. He received a French colonial education before working as a clerk for the Vietnam Railway Company in Hanoi during the 1920s. Through his job, he <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> several Communists. In this period he became a Marxist.|$|E
5|$|Not {{much detail}} {{is known about}} Bhimsen Thapa's early life. At the age of 11, Bhimsen {{possibly}} <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the Nepalese Royal Palace when his bratabandha ceremony was held together with the Crown Prince Rana Bahadur's in Gorkha in 1785. In 1798, his father took him to Kathmandu and enrolled him as a bodyguard to the king. In Kathmandu, Bhimsen took up residence at Thapathali Durbar, after which he lived in Bagh Durbar near Tundikhel after becoming a kaji (equivalent to a minister).|$|E

It was at Pres where O'Gara first <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> Declan Kidney, who was head of rugby at the school. Kidney would later go on to coach O'Gara with both Munster and Ireland. He attended University College Cork and won an All-Ireland Under-20 medal in 1996. He graduated with a B.A. and a master's degree in Business Economics in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after commissioning, New York became {{flagship}} for the United States {{occupation of}} Veracruz in 1914.

She twice <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> German U-boats, and {{is believed to have}} accidentally sunk one.
