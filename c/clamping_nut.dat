50|$|The {{damping force}} of a {{friction}} shock absorber is adjusted with the central pivot and clamping bolt. A star-shaped spring applies a force to the stack of disks. The damping force is roughly proportional to this force and the <b>clamping</b> <b>nut</b> is provided with a pointer arm to indicate the approximate setting.|$|E
40|$|A failed oxygen-charging valve of an {{aircraft}} was analyzed. Evidences suggest that fire was caused due to leakage in the valve. Analysis {{shows that the}} leakage was due to failure of the sealing in the valve. This had resulted in sudden movement of the spindle in the axial direction. The movement appears to have caused frictional heating at the threaded region of the spindle. The heat thus generated resulted in ignition of aluminium {{in the presence of}} high-pressure oxygen. Following this, the hand-wheel along with the spindle had popped out of the valve by fracturing the <b>clamping</b> <b>nut...</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{key length}} of the {{workpiece}} (for example screws, <b>nuts,</b> <b>clamps)</b> is nominally {{the same as that}} on the tool.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a static}} {{restraint}} i.e. {{it is designed}} to withstand tensile load only (no compression load should be exerted on it, in such case buckling may take place). It is rigid vertical type support provide from top only. It consists of <b>clamp,</b> eye <b>nut,</b> tie rod, beam attachment. Selection of rod hanger depends on pipe size, load, temperature, insulation, assembly length etc. As it comes with hinge and clamp, no substantial frictional force comes into play.|$|R
40|$|An {{electrical}} generator has been integrated with a locally produced, biomass-fed clay cooking stove in rural Malawi. The generator produces {{small amounts of}} electricity based on the thermoelectric effect. Five demonstrator stoves were deployed into a rural community in the Balaka district for up to 6 months. This study investigates the power generation performance of the devices over the first 80 days of the field trial. It was determined that the users were able to charge mobile phones, lights and radios from the generator stoves. The power generating performance of the stoves deteriorated slightly over the 80 day period. The {{was due to the}} effects of thermal cycling on the generator system as a whole which caused eventual drying out of the thermal paste and a loosening of the <b>clamping</b> <b>nuts</b> which reduces <b>clamping</b> pressure and power output. One stove failed due to a mechanical problem. It was found that the power produced significantly exceeded the power consumed in most cases, which indicates an over-supply. It appears that 3 W h is sufficient to meet the average daily electrical power requirements for the participants in this study. The data obtained from the field trial has been used to inform a redesign of the device for a second field trial...|$|R
40|$|Results of {{measurements}} on silverized teflon, {{heat shrink tubing}} and nylon tie downs on the wire harness <b>clamps,</b> silvered hex <b>nuts,</b> and contamination deposits are presented. We interpret the results {{in terms of our}} microenvironments exposure model and locations on the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF). Distinct changes in the surface properties of FEP were observed as a function of UV exposure. Significant differences in outgassing characteristics were detected for hardware on the interior row 3 relative to identical hardware on the interior row 3 relative to identical hardware on nearby rows. The implications for in service performance are reviewed...|$|R
50|$|The body {{is small}} {{with a deep}} double cutaway similar to the Fender Swinger. The tuning {{machines}} are found on the upper edge of the triangular headstock and a locking <b>nut</b> <b>clamps</b> the strings behind a plastic nut, as typically found on Fender guitars. The rosewood fretboard has 24 jumbo frets and features a locking nut. The bridge is a floating System I tremolo. The controls have inset rubber grips, the tuning heads have fully enclosed gears, and the jack socket is an enclosed, not 'skeleton', type, in contrast to many other Fender products with 'economy' hardware. A variety of metallic poly finishes were available including a sunburst pattern (non-metallic).|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} optimisation of overhead conductors {{depends on}} the systematic investigation of the fretting fatigue mechanisms in the conductor/clamping system. As a consequence, a fretting fatigue rig was designed and a limited range of fatigue tests was carried out at the middle high cycle fatigue regime in order to access an exploratory S-N curve for a Grosbeak conductor, which was mounted on a mono-articulated aluminium clamping system. Subsequent to these preliminary fatigue tests, {{the components of the}} conductor/clamping system, such as ACSR conductor, upper and lower <b>clamps,</b> bolt and <b>nuts,</b> were subjected to a failure analysis procedure in order to investigate the metallurgical free variables interfering on the fatigue test results, aiming at the optimisation of the testing reproducibility. The results indicated that the rupture of the planar fracture surfaces observed in the external At strands of the conductor tested under lower bending amplitude (0. 9 mm) occurred by fatigue cracking (I mm deep), followed by shear overload. The V-type fracture surfaces observed in some At strands of the conductor tested under higher bending amplitude (1. 3 mm) were also produced by fatigue cracking (approximately 400 mu m deep), followed by shear overload. Shear overload fracture (45 degrees fracture surface) was also observed on the remaining At wires of the conductor tested under higher bending amplitude (1. 3 mm). Additionally, the upper and lower Al-cast clamps presented microstructure-sensitive cracking, which was folowed by particle detachment and formation of abrasive debris on the clamp/conductor tribo-interface, promoting even further the fretting mechanism. The detrimental formation of abrasive debris might be inhibited by the selection of a more suitable class of as-cast At alloy for the production of clamps. Finally, the bolt/nut system showed intense degradation of the carbon steel nut (fabricated in ferritic-pearlitic carbon steel, featuring machined threads with 190 HV), with intense plastic deformation and loss of material. Proper selection of both the bolt and nut materials and the finishing processing might prevent the loss in the clamping pressure during the fretting testing. It is important to control the specification of these components (<b>clamps,</b> bolt and <b>nuts)</b> {{prior to the start of}} large scale fretting fatigue testing of the overhead conductors in order to increase the reproducibility of this assessment.
