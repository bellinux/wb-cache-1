The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for discussion about {{the language}}'s development; specific issues {{are discussed in the}} Roundup bug tracker maintained at python.org.

5|$|The Heartbeat Extension for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) {{protocols}} {{was proposed}} {{as a standard}} in February 2012 by RFC 6520. It provides a way to test and keep alive secure communication links without the need to renegotiate the connection each time. In 2011, one of the RFC's authors, Robin Seggelmann, then a Ph.D. student at the Fachhochschule Münster, implemented the Heartbeat Extension for OpenSSL. Following Seggelmann's request to put {{the result of his}} work into OpenSSL, his change was reviewed by Stephen N. Henson, one of OpenSSL's four core developers. Henson failed to notice a bug in Seggelmann's implementation, and introduced the flawed code into OpenSSL's source <b>code</b> <b>repository</b> on December 31, 2011. The defect spread with the release of OpenSSL version 1.0.1 on March 14, 2012. Heartbeat support was enabled by default, causing affected versions to be vulnerable.|$|E

Most vendors use only stable and tested versions of GNOME, and provide it in the form of easily installed, pre-compiled packages. The source code of every stable and development version of GNOME is stored in the GNOME git source <b>code</b> <b>repository.</b> Interested users can always obtain a snapshot of the _master_ development branch or any other branch/tag and build a cutting-edge version for their own use.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to developers, FreeBSD has thousands of [...] "contributors". Contributors are also volunteers {{outside of the}} FreeBSD project who submit patches for consideration by committers, as they don't have direct access to FreeBSD's source <b>code</b> <b>repository.</b> Committers then evaluate contributors submissions and decide what to accept and what to reject. A contributor who submits high-quality patches is often asked to become a committer.|$|E
500|$|On 27 January 2006, the {{developers}} responsible {{for maintaining the}} ReactOS <b>code</b> <b>repository</b> disabled access after a meeting was held to discuss the allegations. When approached by NewsForge, Microsoft declined to comment about the incident. Since ReactOS is a free and open-source software development project, the claim triggered a negative reaction by the free software community; in particular, Wine barred several inactive developers from providing contributions and formal high level cooperation between the two projects remained difficult [...] Contributions from several active ReactOS developers have been accepted post-audit, and low level cooperation for bug fixes still occurs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Much of {{the data}} about free, libre, and open source (FLOSS) {{software}} development comes from studies of <b>code</b> <b>repositories</b> used for managing projects. This paper presents a method for integrating data about open source projects by way of matching projects (entities) and deleting duplicates across multiple <b>code</b> <b>repositories.</b> After {{a review of the}} relevant literature, a few of the methods are chosen and applied to the FLOSS domain, including a simple scoring system for confidence in pairwise project matches. Finally, the paper describes limitations of this approach and recommendations for future work. ...|$|R

2500|$|The first NetBSD source <b>code</b> <b>repository</b> was {{established}} on March 21, 1993 {{and the initial}} release, NetBSD 0.8, was made in April 1993. [...] This was derived from 386BSD 0.1 plus the version 0.2.2 unofficial patchkit, with several programs from the Net/2 release missing from 386BSD re-integrated, and various other improvements. [...] In August 1993, NetBSD 0.9 was released, which contained many enhancements and bug fixes. This was still a PC-platform-only release, although by this time work was underway to add support for other architectures.|$|E
2500|$|After {{stealing}} the customers' data, cyber-thieves also accessed Adobe's source <b>code</b> <b>repository,</b> likely in mid-August 2013. Because hackers acquired {{copies of the}} source code of Adobe proprietary products, they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security, computer experts warned. Security researcher Alex Holden, chief information security officer of Hold Security, characterized this Adobe breach, which affected Acrobat, ColdFusion and numerous other applications, as [...] "one of the worst in US history". Adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of Photoshop, which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques and {{would make it easier}} to pirate Adobe's expensive products.|$|E
40|$|<b>Code</b> <b>repositories</b> play {{a central}} role in the reuse and mining of {{existing}} assets when engineering large, complex software systems. It is, therefore, essential that database support be extended to new programming paradigms as and when they emerge. This paper proposes an approach to support the storage, reuse and mining of aspects - constructs used in Aspect- Oriented Programming (AOP) to separate crosscutting concerns - in AspectJ (an aspect language for Java) using a relational database. The approach is based on mapping an aspect’s anatomy to the relational model hence allowing finegrained queries to be composed. This results in greater flexibility during search and retrieval in contrast with most existing <b>code</b> <b>repositories</b> which store the code as BLObs complemented by meta-data about the code...|$|R

2500|$|In August 2011, Linus Torvalds {{said that}} [...] "eventually Android and Linux {{would come back}} to a common kernel, but it will {{probably}} not be for four to five years". In December 2011, Greg Kroah-Hartman announced the start of Android Mainlining Project, which aims to put some Android drivers, patches and features back into the Linux kernel, starting in Linux 3.3. Linux included the autosleep and wakelocks capabilities in the 3.5 kernel, after many previous attempts at merger. The interfaces are the same but the upstream Linux implementation allows for two different suspend modes: to memory (the traditional suspend that Android uses), and to disk (hibernate, as it is known on the desktop). Google maintains a public <b>code</b> <b>repository</b> that contains their experimental work to re-base Android off the latest stable Linux versions.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1994, De Raadt {{was asked}} to resign his {{position}} as a senior developer {{and member of the}} NetBSD core team, and his access to the source <b>code</b> <b>repository</b> was revoked. The reason for this is not wholly clear, although there are claims that it was due to personality clashes within the NetBSD project and on its mailing lists. De Raadt has been criticized for having a somewhat abrasive personality: in his book, Free for All, Peter Wayner claims that De Raadt [...] "began to rub some people the wrong way" [...] before the split from NetBSD; while Linus Torvalds has described him as [...] "difficult". Many have different feelings: the same interviewer describes De Raadt's [...] "transformation" [...] on founding OpenBSD and his [...] "desire {{to take care of his}} team," [...] some find his straightforwardness refreshing, and few deny he is a talented hacker and security [...] "guru".|$|E
