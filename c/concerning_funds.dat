40|$|ABSTRACT From 2005 to 2015, {{the total}} assets managed by open private pension funds {{increased}} more than six times in Brazil, where the Free Benefit Generating Plan (PGBL) and the Free Benefit Generating Life (VGBL) represent 90 % of these assets. However, private pension institutions are characterized by the collection of high management fees, thus keeping for themselves much of the benefits offered by the government as incentive for investment in this modality. High management fees are justified only when there is active management of these funds, theoretically generating higher performance: this study indicates {{that this is not}} the case in this market segment. Similar problems have been faced in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden, which filed investigation <b>concerning</b> <b>funds</b> that charge high management fees for active management, while they actually provide management that may be regarded as passive. This demonstrates the scale and relevance of this issue, which has been surveyed and addressed by this study. To do this, dynamic style analysis was performed, through rolling regressions, followed by Kalman filter analysis in funds from the top-five private pension institutions in Brazil. Analyzing the exposure evolution of these funds to various asset classes and the R 2 generated, passivity traces were found, mainly in composite variable income funds. Such funds are precisely those that should be more actively managed, as they charge the highest management fees. This article also demonstrates it is possible to build a passive portfolio, having a very similar style and returns without statistically significant differences, but at a lower management fee (and aligned with passive funds) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} {{conditions}} one could hardly expect a rapid establishment {{and development of}} investment funds investing in real estate in Poland, not only {{due to the lack}} of relevant legal regulations. Among some further causes there are some technical obstacles in dealing in real estate as well as an often unclear legal status of real property. Besides, the high minimal allowed asset value is an additional deterrent. Currently, this minimal value is 0. 5 billion zl for an investment of 30 - 40 million zł. This condition follows the requirement to maintain an appropriate level of investment diversification in order to reduce the risks involved. The only specialist closed investment fund that has ever attempted to invest in real estate in Poland failed to collect even 10 % of the amount. Another obstacle in developing specialist closed investment funds investing in real estate is also the relatively short time of keeping shares by Polish investment fund shareholders (in Germany the median of keeping open investment fund shares being 7 years). This can impede selling off specialist closed investment fund shares and in the case of open funds it also implies the need to maintain a high share of liquid securities (especially T-bonds) with a view to securing possible obligations involved in share redemption. This can in consequence reduce the investment return rate. When drafting legislation <b>concerning</b> <b>funds</b> investing in real estate (especially open ones) one should focus in particular upon their investment target. Transparency of the real estate market is veiy limited, as there is no full information on the deals handled on this market; also, the object of the deals, i. e. real estate ownership, is atypical. On the market it is dealt in ownership rights, which are highly individualized and which are priced on the basis of a number of factors, such as the location, legal and physical condition, or local land development plan, all of which add up to the individual value of each property. One should therefore consider limiting the investment target of future open real estate funds only to managing and reaping profits from owned real property rather than allow speculative transactions, which should be allowed only for specialist closed investment funds. Collective real estate investment institutions are an important element of developed capital markets. It is hard not to appreciate their impact upon the development of real estate market and due to a relatively low risk involved in investing in this market, such institutions are a significant long-term saving instrument (especially toward pension). One should hope that the legislator will soon give a green light to the investments in question not only for smaller investors (for whom open real estate funds will be available) but also to e. g. open pension funds. Under the current law open pension funds are banned from investing not only directly in real estate but also in specialist closed investment fund shares...|$|E
