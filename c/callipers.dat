Inside it features Nappa leather on the seats. The braking system on the Senator comes with ABS with twin-piston front <b>callipers</b> and grooved discs. The specially designed rear suspension has a self-levelling feature, so if the Senator was towing a trailer, instead of the weight forcing the back down and causing {{the front of the}} car to go up, the rear suspension would harden itself and therefore keeping the car levelled and aerodynamic. This feature is also on the current E-series Senator Signature and has been optioned on Holden models as far back as WH Caprice in 1999.|$|E
25|$|The R32 Skyline {{debuted in}} May 1989. It was {{available}} {{as either a}} 2-door coupe or 4-door hardtop sedan, all other bodystyles were dropped. The R32 featured several versions of the RB-series straight-6 engines, which had improved heads (the twelve port inlet was gone) and used the ECCS (Electronically Concentrated Control System) injection system. Also available was an 1,800 cc 4-cylinder GXi model. Most models had HICAS four-wheel steering, with the rear wheels being hydraulically linked to the front steering. The 2.5-litre GTS-25 {{became one of the}} first Japanese production cars to feature a 5-speed automatic transmission. The GTS-t came in standard and Type M configurations, with the Type M having larger five-stud 16-inch wheels, four piston front <b>callipers</b> and twin piston rears plus other minor differences. ABS was optional (except for the GT-R and GTS-4), mechanical LSD was standard on the GTR and viscous LSD was standard on all turbo models and optional on all but the GXi. Nissan also produced 100 Australian models of the R32. In addition, there was a 4WD version of the GTS-t Type M, called the GTS-4.|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{describe}} {{a new technique}} of suturing a tear in the anterior capsulorhexis. Methods: Continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC) with lens removal was done in five fresh cadaver eyes. The diameter of the CCC was measured with a <b>calliper.</b> Using the same <b>calliper</b> a tear of the CCC was created while opening the <b>calliper’s</b> arms. The distance between the <b>calliper’s</b> arms needed to tear the CCC was documented. Using 9 - 0 Ethilon 9011, CS 160 - 6 sutures in two eyes, 9 - 0 Prolene, D- 8229, CTC- 6 L sutures in two eyes, and 10 - 0 Prolene, 9090, CTC- 6 suture in one eye, the tears were sutured. A tear in the CCC was created again {{in the same way}} as the first tear. The distance between the <b>calliper’s</b> arms needed to tear the CCC was documented again. Results: Suturing of the tear restored some of the strength...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{material}} selection and design selection of high performance floating brake <b>calliper.</b> The main function of brake {{system is to}} decelerate or stop a car. Disc brake system consist of brake rotor, brake pads and brake <b>calliper.</b> Most of the commercial vehicles use brake <b>calliper</b> made of Gray cast iron which possess heavy weight results in high fuel consumption. Another major problem is <b>calliper</b> being deflection during clamping action, known as “bending of bridge” will results in extended pedal travel since additional braking fluid volume is required to compensate for deflections, reduce comfort, driving feelings and safety of vehicle. The demand of Metal Matrix Composites (MMC) is greatly increased in automotive industry since it having a lower density, higher strength and comparable modulus of elasticity as compared to Gray cast iron. The objective of this thesis is to study the advantages of Magnesium hybrid MMC to replace conventional brake <b>calliper</b> and proposed few innovative design alternatives for automotive industry. This is done by creating an original brake <b>calliper</b> and validate for appropriate material using Finite Element Analysis (FEA), followed by select optimum design. In design selection, Quality Function Deployment (QFD) approach was used to rank the design parameters, few alternative designs were created using CatiaV 5 R 17 and analyzed for static structural analysis using FEA. In the end, best floating brake <b>calliper</b> design among those alternative designs was selected using Super Decision software. For further research, these fresh designs could be act as benchmark for further developed and tested for automotive applications...|$|R
500|$|Storylines for a {{potential}} series had been drafted by writer Mike Bullen during production of the pilot. When production on the series began, producer Christine Langan worked with him to create detailed plots for all six episodes, also acting as a script editor to redraft Bullen's work. Many of the plots were drawn from his own life; Pete and Jenny bringing up their new baby paralleled Bullen and his wife, whose first child was born in late 1997. The scenes where Pete and Jenny attend the antenatal classes were written from Bullen's memory, {{when he and his}} wife were [...] "given <b>callipers,</b> forceps and a suction cup to play with". The conclusion of the fourth episode, in which Pete's father dies on the way to his grandson's christening, was suggested by Harries, whose own experience of the death of his father taught him that people rarely have the opportunity to say goodbye to loved ones in real life. Not all storylines were based on real life: For Karen and David's marriage guidance scenes in Episode 5, Bullen consulted the relationship support charity Relate. Actors and directors also had input into the scripts; Bullen's original script for the marriage therapy scenes ended with David shouting and apparently using a fire extinguisher as an offensive weapon. Bathurst was not convinced that was something that his character would do, as David is [...] "too much of a coward to do anything overtly" [...] and would not leave himself so [...] "exposed": ...|$|E

The first comprehensive {{account is}} given by Mme Delusse in her article [...] "Gravure en lettres, en géographie et en musique" [...] in Diderot's Encyclopedia. The technique involved a five-pointed raster to score staff lines, various punches in the shapes of notes and standard musical symbols, and various burins and scorers for lines and slurs. For correction, the plate was held on a bench by <b>callipers,</b> hit with a dot punch on the opposite side, and burnished to remove any signs of the defective work.

60|$|In a week I {{obtained}} no {{less than}} twenty-four species of birds, which I had {{not found in the}} east of the island, and in a fortnight this number increased to forty species, almost all of which are peculiar to the Javanese fauna. Large and handsome butterflies were also tolerably abundant. In dark ravines, and occasionally on the roadside, I captured the superb Papilio arjuna, whose wings seem powdered with grains of golden green, condensed into bands and moon-shaped spots; while the elegantly-formed Papilio coön was sometimes to be found fluttering slowly along the shady pathways (see figure at page 201). One day a boy brought me a butterfly between his fingers, perfectly unhurt. He had caught it as it was sitting with wings erect, sucking up the liquid from a muddy spot by the roadside. Many of the finest tropical butterflies have this habit, and they are generally so intent upon their meal that they can be easily be reached and captured. It proved to be the rare and curious Charaxes kadenii, remarkable for having on each hind wing two curved tails like a pair of <b>callipers.</b> It was the only specimen I ever saw, and is still the only representative of its kind in English collections.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{every man}} who has searched his heart knows that this {{formulation}} of [...] "criminality" [...] as a specific quality is a stupidity, he knows {{himself to be a}} criminal, just as most men know themselves to be sexually rogues. No man is born with an instinctive respect for the rights of any property but his own, and few with a passion for monogamy. No man who is not an outrageously vain and foolish creature but will confess to himself that but for advantages and accidents, but for a chance hesitation or a lucky timidity, he, too, had been there, under the ridiculous <b>callipers</b> of witless anthropology. A criminal is no doubt of less personal value to the community than a law-abiding citizen of the same general calibre, but it does not follow for one moment that he is of less value as a parent. His personal disaster {{may be due to the}} possession of a bold and enterprising character, of a degree of pride and energy above the needs of the position his social surroundings have forced upon him. Another citizen may have all this man's desires and impulses, checked and sterilized by a lack of nervous energy, by an abject fear of the policeman and of the consequences of the disapproval of his more prosperous fellow-citizens. I will frankly confess that for my own part I prefer the wicked to the mean, and that I would rather trust the future to the former strain than to the latter. Whatever preference the reader may entertain, there remains this unmistakable objection to its application to breeding, that [...] "criminality" [...] is not a specific simple quality, but a complex that may interfuse with other complexes to give quite incalculable results in the offspring it produces. So that here again, on the negative side, we find a general expression unserviceable for our use. [Footnote: No doubt the home of the criminal and social failure is generally disastrous to the children born into it. That is a question that will be fully dealt; with in a subsequent paper, and I note it here only to point out that it is outside our present discussion, which is concerned not with the fate of children born into the world, but with the prior question whether we may hope to improve the quality of the average birth by encouraging some sorts of people to have children and discouraging or forbidding others. It is of vital importance to keep these two questions distinct, if we are to get at last to a basis for effective action.] ...|$|E

6000|$|Anthropology {{has been}} {{compared}} to a great region, marked out indeed as within the sphere of influence of science, but unsettled {{and for the most part}} unsubdued. Like all such hinterland sciences, it is a happy hunting-ground for adventurers. Just as in the early days of British Somaliland, rascals would descend from nowhere in particular upon unfortunate villages, levy taxes and administer atrocity in the name of the Empire, and even, I am told, outface for a time the modest heralds of the government, so in this department of anthropology the public mind suffers from the imposition of theories and assertions claiming to be [...] "scientific," [...] which have no more relation to that organized system of criticism which is science, than a brigand at large on a mountain has to the machinery of law and police, by which finally he will be hanged. Among such raiding theorists none at present are in quite such urgent need of polemical suppression as those who would persuade the heedless general reader that every social failure is necessarily a [...] "degenerate," [...] and who claim boldly that they can trace a distinctly evil and mischievous strain in that unfortunate miscellany which constitutes [...] "the criminal class."
