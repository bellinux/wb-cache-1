50|$|Light shelves {{may not be}} {{suitable}} for all <b>climates.</b> They are generally used in mild <b>climates</b> and not in tropical or desert <b>climates</b> due to the intense solar heat gain.

5000|$|Wine {{regions with}} {{maritime}} <b>climates</b> are characterised by their {{close proximity to}} large bodies of water (such as oceans, estuaries and inland seas) that moderate their temperatures. Maritime <b>climates</b> share many characteristics with both Mediterranean and continental <b>climates</b> and are often described as a [...] "middle ground" [...] between the two extremes. Like Mediterranean <b>climates,</b> maritime <b>climates</b> have a long growing season, with water currents moderating the region's temperatures. However, while Mediterranean <b>climates</b> are usually very dry during the growing season, maritime <b>climates</b> are often subject to the viticultural hazards of excessive rain and humidity which may promote various grape diseases, such as mold and mildew. Like continental <b>climates,</b> maritime <b>climates</b> will have distinct seasonal changes, but they are usually not as drastic, with warm, rather than hot, summers and cool, rather than cold, winters. Maritime <b>climates</b> also exist in some wine-growing areas of highlands of subtropical and tropical latitudes, including the southern Appalachian Mountains in the USA, eastern Australian highlands, and central highlands of Mexico.|$|R

5|$|<b>Climate</b> {{forecasting}} {{is a way}} by {{some scientists}} are using to predict <b>climate</b> change. In 1997 the prediction division of the International Research Institute for <b>Climate</b> and Society at Columbia University began generating seasonal <b>climate</b> forecasts on a real-time basis. To produce these forecasts an extensive suite of forecasting tools was developed, including a multimodel ensemble approach that required thorough validation of each model's accuracy level in simulating interannual <b>climate</b> variability.|$|E
5|$|Cook's {{education}} {{includes a}} background in physics. Prior to {{his work on the}} book, Cook founded the website Skeptical Science, which compiles peer-reviewed evidence of <b>climate</b> change. He placed on the site the most common assertions made by individuals arguing against the scientific consensus for <b>climate</b> change, with evidence to refute each point they made. After the publication of <b>Climate</b> Change Denial: Heads in the Sand, Cook coauthored another book on the subject, <b>Climate</b> Change Science: A Modern Synthesis: Volume 1– The Physical <b>Climate</b> (2013). In 2015, Cook served as the <b>climate</b> communication fellow at the University of Queensland.|$|E

5|$|GCC did not fund {{original}} {{scientific research}} and its <b>climate</b> claims relied largely on the World <b>Climate</b> Review and its successor the World <b>Climate</b> Report edited by Patrick Michaels and funded by the Western Fuels Association. GCC promoted the views of <b>climate</b> skeptics such as Michaels, Fred Singer, and Richard Lindzen. In 1996, GCC published a report entitled Global warming and extreme weather: fact vs. fiction written by Robert E. Davis.|$|E
5|$|GCC's {{advocacy}} activities included lobbying government officials, grassroots lobbying through {{press releases}} and advertising, participation in international <b>climate</b> conferences, {{criticism of the}} processes of international <b>climate</b> organizations, critiques of <b>climate</b> models, and personal attacks on scientists and environmentalists. Policy positions advocated by the coalition included denial of anthropogenic <b>climate</b> change, emphasizing the uncertainty in climatology, advocating for additional research, highlighting the benefits and downplaying the risks of <b>climate</b> change, stressing the priority of economic development, defending national sovereignty, and opposition to the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E

5|$|Northwest Argentina is {{predominantly}} dry, hot, and subtropical. Owing to its rugged topography, {{the region is}} climatically diverse, depending on the altitude, temperature, and distribution of precipitation. Consequently, vegetation differs within these different <b>climate</b> types. In general, the <b>climate</b> {{can be divided into}} two main types: a cold arid or semi-arid <b>climate</b> at the higher altitudes, and warmer subtropical <b>climate</b> in the eastern parts of the region. Under the Köppen <b>climate</b> classification, the region has 5 different <b>climate</b> types: semi–arid (BS), arid (BW), temperate <b>climate</b> without a dry season and with a dry season (Cf and CW respectively), and an alpine <b>climate</b> at the highest altitudes.|$|E

50|$|Oceanic <b>climates</b> {{can have}} much storm {{activity}} {{as they are}} located in the belt of the stormy westerlies. Many oceanic <b>climates</b> have frequent cloudy or overcast conditions due to the near constant storms and lows tracking over or near them.
