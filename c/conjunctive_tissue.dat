50|$|Reinke {{began his}} medical studies in 1883 at the University of Goettingen and Kiel and {{received}} his medical degree on March 28, 1891 with a specialization in anatomy. His doctoral thesis, Untersuchungen über das Verhältnis der von Arnold beschriebenen Kernformen zur Mitose und Amitose (Investigations {{into the relationship}} of the nuclear forms described by Arnold to mitosis and amitosis), was an in-depth study of cell division. Upon graduation, Reinke completed a 6-month internship at the Pathology Institute of the University of Zurich. There, he studied under Edwin Klebs. Reinke developed a collegial relationship with Otto Lubarsch, who at that time was an assistant in the Institute. On completion of his internship, Reinke served as a ship's doctor on the passenger liner Weiland bound for Brazil where he visited some members of his family. He returned to Germany in 1893 to complete a second internship as a junior physician in Dahmen, Mecklenburg. Subsequently, Professor Albert von Brunn offered Reinke the position of first demonstrator at the Anatomical Institute of the University of Rostock, perhaps through the intercession of Dr Lubarsch. There he achieved his habilitation, or Venia Legendi, a postdoctoral qualification common to many European academic systems that entitles the holder to supervise doctoral candidates and is thus essential for an academic career. His habilitation thesis, reviewed and defended before committee, was entitled Zellstudien (Cellular Studies), an investigation of the cell structure in the germ layer of the human skin. Specifically, he investigated leukocytes, the cells of the <b>conjunctive</b> <b>tissue,</b> collagenous and elastic fibers, pigment, and cell differentiation.|$|E
50|$|Typically, the {{build-up}} of {{a natural}} pearl consists of a brown central zone formed by columnar calcium carbonate (usually calcite, sometimes columnar aragonite) and a yellowish to white outer zone consisting of nacre (tabular aragonite). In a pearl cross-section such as the diagram, these two different materials can be seen. The presence of columnar calcium carbonate rich in organic material indicates juvenile mantle tissue that formed during the early stage of pearl development. Displaced living cells with a well-defined task may continue to perform their function in their new location, often resulting in a cyst. Such displacement may occur via an injury. The fragile rim of the shell is exposed and is prone to damage and injury. Crabs, other predators and parasites such as worm larvae may produce traumatic attacks and cause injuries in which some external mantle tissue cells are disconnected from their layer. Embedded in the <b>conjunctive</b> <b>tissue</b> of the mantle, these cells may survive and form a small pocket in which they continue to secrete calcium carbonate, their natural product. The pocket is called a pearl sac, and grows with time by cell division. The juvenile mantle tissue cells, according to their stage of growth, secrete columnar calcium carbonate from pearl sac's inner surface. In time, the pearl sac's external mantle cells proceed {{to the formation of}} tabular aragonite. When the transition to nacre secretion occurs, the brown pebble becomes covered with a nacreous coating. During this process, the pearl sac seems to travel into the shell; however, the sac actually stays in its original relative position the mantle tissue while the shell itself grows. After a couple of years, a pearl forms and the shell may be found by a lucky pearl fisher.|$|E

40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Biologia (Genética), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências, 2012 Mutations in the GJB 2 gene are {{responsible}} for a considerable proportion of nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSSHL), in several populations. This gene {{is a member of}} a gene family coding for connexins, the subunits of the hemichannels (connexons) which form the intercellular channels of the gap junctions existing in the vertebrates and tunicates. Connexin- 26 (Cx 26), encoded by the GJB 2 gene, is expressed in several tissues, including specific epithelial and <b>conjunctive</b> <b>tissues</b> of the cochlea, the auditory organ which is localised to the inner ear. In the cochlea, Cx 26 is co-expressed with connexin- 30 (Cx 30), encoded by the GJB 6 gene, in several cell types. Two large GJB 6 deletions are involved in several hearing loss (HL) cases, as well, being most of these cases due to compound heterozygosity with a GJB 2 mutation. Given the relevance of both GJB 2 and GJB 6 genes to the HL etiology in several populations, the molecular diagnosis of NSSHL cases with probable genetic cause is usually initiated by the analysis of the GJB 2 coding region (in which most pathogenic mutations have been found), followed by the investigation of the presence of the GJB 6 deletions in the cases where none or only one GJB 2 mutation is found. In some cases, attributing the cause of the HL to the GJB 2 /GJB 6 genotype is complicated because some GJB 2 mutations are of unclear or controversial pathogenicity, due to either lack of genetic evidence (evident segregation of the mutation with the HL) or contradictory genetic data (same genotype occurring in both normalhearing and hearing-impaired individuals). In those cases, functional studies constitute an adequate approach for the investigation of the putative pathogenicity of such mutations, several of which have already been studied in this way. One of the aims of this work consisted {{in the study of the}} coding region and acceptor splice site of the GJB 2 gene in Portuguese individuals presenting with NSSHL. We have further extended the analysis of the gene to noncoding regions (basal promoter and about 700 bp immediately upstream, exon 1, donor splice site and the whole 3 ’UTR). These noncoding regions have rarely been studied. Nonetheless, two pathogenic noncoding mutations had previously been identified, both in the donor splice site. Initially, we analysed the basal promoter, exon 1 and donor splice site in some patients who only harboured one coding mutation. We then found a novel mutation (c. - 259 C>T) in the basal promoter, in one of the binding sites for Sp 1 /Sp 3 transcription factors. This mutation was found in a profoundly hearing-impaired patient, in trans with p. Val 84 Met, that we had identified as a novel mutation, in a previous work. Later, we analised all the fore mentioned noncoding regions in a larger sample, including monoallelic patients and also those harbouring no mutation in the GJB 2 coding region (n= 89) as well as 91 controls who reported to have normal hearing. The obtained data revealed that the c. [* 168 A>G(+) * 931 C>T] double heterozygous genotype, regarding the rs 55704559 and rs 5030700 SNPs (both localised to the 3 ’UTR), respectively, is overrepresented in the patients. In silico analysis predicts that the c. * 168 A>G variant (regardless of the fact that in position c. * 931 is a cytosine or a thymine) causes an alteration of mRNA folding. Thus, our data suggest that the c. * 168 G allele might be associated with HL. Other aim of this work was to investigate the effects of the mutations c. - 259 C>T and p. Val 84 Met, mentioned above, and the mutation p. Met 163 Leu, also identified for the first time in a previous work, in other Portuguese family. The available genetic data regarding these mutations were insufficient to prove their pathogenicity, and thus we have performed functional studies on the three mutations. The obtained results suggest that the three mutations are indeed pathogenic, exerting their effect in distinct ways. The c. - 259 C>T mutation decreases very significantly the basal promoter activity. As regards the coding mutations, p. Val 84 Met alters the ionic and molecular permeability properties of the intercellular channel, which may compromise their function in vivo, while p. Met 163 Leu leads to cell death, possibly by a mechanism other than the malfunctioning of undocked hemichannels (already described in the literature), and has a partial dominant-negative effect on wild-type Cx 26 (wtCx 26) and Cx 30 (wtCx 30).

In the cochlea, Cx 26 is co-expressed with connexin- 30 (Cx 30), encoded by the GJB 6 gene, in several cell types. Two large GJB 6 deletions are involved in several hearing loss (HL) cases, as well, being most of these cases due to compound heterozygosity with a GJB 2 mutation. Given the relevance of both GJB 2 and GJB 6 genes to the HL|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- As a {{research}} material {{we have used}} the hypophyses of 14 Holstein bulls aged of 3 - 8 years. The samples have been fixed in Orth, Carnoy, and Helly, led up to paraffin, and serially sectioned at 5 µm. We have finally obtained 420 serial sections stained through the methods Novelli, PAS, Papanicolau, MH 2, Fontana, Steedman-Mowry, Bielschowsky, Bodian and Holmes. The intermediary lobe is well developed in the bull. It is always adjacent to the posterior lobe of the bull hypophysis, and separated from it by a discontinuous layer of <b>conjunctive</b> <b>tissue.</b> The follicular structures (110 - 360 µm), containing colloid in the lumen, {{were found in the}} intermediary lobe of 14 bull hypophysis. A thin <b>conjunctive</b> <b>tissue</b> separated these follicular structures. They formed cysts, which contained colloid. The colloid is a pale-staining material, PAS-positive, and is surrounded by simple squamous or cubical epithelium. The colloid consists in a glycoprotein in the Steedman-Mowry stain. The intermediary lobe of the hypophysis makes a hormone MSH (Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone), which is responsible for the expansion of melanocytes from the animals ’ skin.

40|$|Asthma is an {{inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} airways clinically characterised by recurrent bronchial obstructions at least partially reversible. Recent epidemiologic data suggest that asthmatics have an increased rate of decrease of their expiratory volumes during life. This irreversible lung function impairment is associated with fundamental structural changes of the bronchial wall in terms of <b>conjunctive</b> <b>tissue</b> and smooth muscle composition. We describe these changes and explore the different mechanisms proposed to explain these structural modifications. We also review their consequences in terms of bronchial physiology and their potential influence on bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{evaluated}} {{the response of}} subcutaneous connective tissue of isogenic mice to calcium hydroxide-based pastes with chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX). Seventy isogenic male BALB/c mice aged 6 - 8 weeks and weighing 15 - 20 g {{were randomly assigned to}} 8 groups. The animals received polyethylene tube implants as follows: Groups I, II, and III (n= 10) - Calen® paste mixed with 0. 4 % CHX (experimental paste; Calen/CHX) for 7, 21, and 63 days, respectively; Groups IV, V, and VI (n= 10) - UltraCal&# 8482; paste mixed with 2 % CHX (experimental paste supplied by Ultradent Products Inc.; Ultracal/CHX) for 7, 21, and 63 days, respectively; and Groups VII and VIII (n= 5) : empty tube for 7 and 21 days, respectively. At the end of the experimental periods, the implants were removed together with the surrounding tissues (skin and subcutaneous connective tissue). The biopsied tissues were subjected to routine processing for histological analysis. Using a descriptive analysis and a four-point (0 - 3) scoring system, the following criteria were considered for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the tissue around the implanted materials: collagen fiber formation, tissue thickness and inflammatory infiltrate. A quantitative analysis was performed by measuring the thickness (µm), area (µm²) and perimeter (µm) of the reactionary granulomatous tissue formed at the tube ends. Data were analyzed statistically by the Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn's post-test (&# 945;= 0. 05). Calen/CHX showed biocompatibility with the subcutaneous and reactionary tissues, with areas of discrete fibrosis and normal <b>conjunctive</b> fibrous <b>tissue,</b> though without statistically significant difference (p> 0. 05) from the control groups. In Groups I to III, there was a predominance of score 1, while in Groups IV to VI scores 2 and 3 predominated for all analyzed parameters. UltraCal/CHX, on the other hand, induced the formation of an inflammatory infiltrate and abundant exudate, suggesting a persistent residual aggression from the material, even 63 days after implant placement. In conclusion, the Calen paste mixed with 0. 4 % CHX allowed an adequate tissue response, whereas the UltraCal paste mixed with 2 % CHX showed unsatisfactory results...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a intensidade das reações inflamatórias do tecido conjuntivo subcutâneo de ratos, ao implante dos cimentos Sealer 26 e óxido de zinco e eugenol protegidos ou não com 2 diferentes tipos de própolis. Foram utilizados 39 ratos, nos quais, após anestesia geral e tricotomia da região dorsal foram {{realizadas}} duas incisões longitudinais. Após divulsão do tecido subcutâneo, foram implantados 3 tubos de polietileno, sendo 2 na região anterior 1 na região posterior, com uma distância de 5 cm entre eles. Cinquenta e quatro tubos foram preenchidos com cimento de óxido de zinco e eugenol consistente. Desses 54 tubos, 36 sofreram aplicação de própolis em suas extremidades recobrindo a área do cimento. Em 18, foi aplicada a própolis BRP 1 e nos restantes a própolis MAR. Os demais tubos não sofreram tratamento nas extremidades. Outros 54 tubos foram preenchidos com Sealer 26, também consistente. Identicamente aos do grupo anterior, 36 deles tiveram as extremidades recobertas com própolis sendo metade com a própolis BRP 1 e a outra com a própolis MAR. Os outros 18 não receberam aplicação da própolis. Os períodos experimentais foram de 7, 30 e 60 dias com 13 animais em cada período, sendo 12 com 3 tubos com os materiaisexperimentais e um que foi usado como controle, a que recebeu 4 tubos, 2 com guta-percha e 2 vazios. Após a morte dos animais, preparo das peças e obtenção dos cortes foram analisados os eventos microscópicos estipulando escores a cadasituação apresentada. A aplicação das própolis recobrindo os cimentos não alterou o comportamento dos mesmos, a própolis tipo MAR mostrou resultados mais favoráveis do que a BRP 1, porém, sem diferença estatística significante entre elas, o óxido de zinco e eugenol apresentou melhor comportamento biológico do que o Sealer 26. Os cimentos quando permaneceram nos tubos comportaram se melhor do que quando extravasados. This research aims {{to evaluate}} the intensity of inflammatory reaction in <b>conjunctive</b> subcutaneous <b>tissue</b> of rats to the sealer 26 and zinc-oxide-eugenol either sheltered or not with two different sorts of propolis. Two incisions were performed in 39 rats after anesthesia and trichotomy of the dorsal region. Three polyethylene tubes were implanted within five centimeters from each other. Fifty-four tubes were filled with zinc-oxide-eugenol sealer consistently. Thirty-six out of these fifty-four tubes were also spread with propolis in their borders sheltering the sealer area. The BRP 1 propolis was sheltered in eighteen of them and MAR propolis was spread on the remaining tubes. The other tubes were not spread on their borders. Other fifty-four tubes were also filled with Sealer 26 consistently. Like the other group, thirty-six tubes were covered with propolis in their borders where half BRP 1 propolis was used and the remaining tubes were covered with MAR propolis. The other eighteen tubes were not spread on their borders. The experimental periods were 7, 30 and 60 days with thirteen animals in each period which twelve animals had three tubes with experimental materials and one animal had four tubes which two tubes were filled with gutta-percha and two empty tubes considered as a control group. After the animalsd́eath, biopsy was performed removing the tubes. The tissues were prepared histologically and after obtaining the cut off, these were analyzed to the microscopic events specifying score. The application of propolis covering the sealers did not change their behavior. MAR propolis showed better results than the BRP 1 propolis, notwithstanding they showed no statistic significant difference. Zinc-oxide-eugenol showed a better biologic behavior than Sealer 26. Both sealers behaved better when kept in the tubes than then they spilled out...|$|R

40|$|Trypanosoma cruzi. The aim of {{this work}} was to analyze histologically and histometrically the sublingual gland of mice {{infected}} with the RAL strain of T cruzi, according to the sex. Swiss mice (Mus musculus) were inoculated with 2 x 10 (4) blood trypomastigotes of the RAL strain of T cruzi. In {{the peak of the}} parasitemia (12 th day) the mice were sacrificed, and the sublingual glands were fixed in ALFAC. HE-stained histological sections were evaluated histometrically. The parasitemia was higher in females. Histopatologically, acini of the infected animals were smaller, with scanty production of secretion, and smaller striated ducts. The nuclei of the demilunes were smaller and showed amastigote nests in the cytoplasm. Karyometrically, nuclei of the acini, demilunes and striated ducts were smaller in the infected mice. Stereologically, it was observed that relative volumes of acini and ducts were smaller and, inversely, relative volumen were greater for the <b>conjunctive</b> <b>tissue</b> in the infected males. The surface densities of acini and ducts were bigger and the diameter and thickness of the wall were smaller in this group. On the other hand, relative volume of acini was smaller and those of the ducts and <b>conjunctive</b> <b>tissue</b> were bigger in the infected females. The diameter and thickness of the wall of acini were smaller, and those of the striated ducts were bigger in this group. The RAL strain of T cruzi caused general atrophy in the sublingual gland, with numerous nests of parasites in the glandular parenchyma...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the existing differences in the pubic symphysis of female rats and mice, pregnant and non pregnant, describing the morphological alterations occurred in the joint and understanding the movements shown during pregnancy. The pubic symphysis were collected from female pregnant mice on the 6 th, 12 th and 18 th days of pregnancy, and from rats with 18 days of pregnancy. They were fixed in paraformoldehyde and following decalcificated with Morse's solution. The samples were then, included in paraffin. Seven micrometers slices were made and stained with Picrosirius and Resorcin-Fuchsin. The Picrosirius staining had shown, in virgin female mice, the presence of thick collagen fibers different from the other groups of mice, which presented thin fibers. The analysis of elastic fibers showed that, with the progress of pregnancy there is an increase in their thickness and number. In rats with 18 days of pregnancy, an appearance of fibrous <b>conjunctive</b> <b>tissue</b> on the hyaline cartilage disc was observed, enlarging the inter-pubic space and modifying the synchondrosis structure found in the virgin animals. It was also observed an increase in diameter and amount of elastic fibers comparing to virgin rats. We conclude that the pregnant female mice's joint undergoes transformations in structure, quality and amount during the pregnancy. In pregnant rats, besides the increase of elastic fibers and the distance between the hip's bone, the joint had differred by the appearance of fibrous <b>conjunctive</b> <b>tissue,</b> thus making the birth easier...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} {{integration}} of keloid heterograft in hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) cheek pouch. METHODS: The sample is formed by 18 male hamsters, heterogenic ones, aged between 10 and 14 weeks. Keloid fragments were obtained from keloid scars of the breast region of adult female mulatto patient. Each hamster received keloid fragments into both of its pouches, {{in a total of}} 36 grafted fragments. Animals were distributed into 6 groups for having their grafts assessed in the days 5, 12, 21, 42, 84, and 168. A macroscopic assessment is performed by comparing the pouch containing the grafted fragment, at each time point, with the same pouch in the immediate post surgical moment through a comparison of standardized photographs. Under microscope, the presence of blood vases is considered within the <b>conjunctive</b> <b>tissue</b> of the grafted fragment, as a criterion of its integration. Other events, as keratin secretion, the presence of cellular infiltrated, epithelium and keloid collagen fibers aspects are also analyzed. RESULTS: Macroscopy reveals intensive vascularization of the pouch up to 12 days from the transplantation and the presence of constant dark brown pigmentation on the grafted keloid fragments. In microscopy, {{the integration of}} keloid fragments is considered by the presence of blood capillary vases within <b>conjunctive</b> <b>tissue.</b> The presence of intensive cellular inflammatory type infiltrated up to 12 days is also observed, as well as the remaining of keloid epithelium up to 21 days, and the appearing of melanocytes from the day 42.
