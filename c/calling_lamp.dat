50|$|In {{the days}} when light came from burning oil in lamps, a vessel at sea needed crewmen to {{constantly}} care for the lamps. This care involved trimming the wick, which drew the oil up from the storage reservoir, so that the flame would be clean and bright. Lamp trimmers also refilled the reservoirs, which held enough oil for several hours of burning, {{but not enough to}} start a major fire if the lamp were to be knocked down or damaged somehow. As vessels became larger, the number of lamp trimmers increased significantly, because the only lighting below decks came from lamps. The position of lamp trimmer was so entrenched into marine tradition that electricians were <b>called</b> <b>lamp</b> trimmers for years after oil lamps had been completely replaced.|$|R
50|$|Clay diyas {{are often}} used {{temporarily}} as lighting for special occasions, while diyas made of brass are permanent fixtures in homes and temples. Diyas are native to India and Nepal often used in Hindu, Sikh, Jain and Zoroastrian religious festivals such as Diwali or the Kushti ceremony. A similar <b>lamp</b> <b>called</b> a butter <b>lamp</b> is used in Tibetan Buddhist offerings as well. Diyas, also known as deepam in Tamil Nadu, can be lighted, especially during the Karthikai Deepam.|$|R

5000|$|Camphine was {{the trade}} {{name of a}} {{purified}} spirit of turpentine formerly used for lamps, generally prepared by distilling turpentine with quicklime. Camphine gives a very brilliant light when burned in a lamp, but, to prevent smoking, the lamp must {{have a very strong}} draught. To achieve this special <b>lamps</b> were constructed, <b>called</b> Vesta <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{temperature}} of the arc in an arc lamp can reach several thousand degrees Celsius. The outer glass envelope can reach 500 degrees Celsius, therefore before servicing one must ensure the bulb has cooled sufficiently to handle. Often, if these types of lamps are turned off or lose their power supply, one cannot restrike the lamp again for several minutes (<b>called</b> cold restrike <b>lamps).</b> However, some lamps (mainly fluorescent tubes/energy saving lamps) can be restruck {{as soon as they}} are turned off (<b>called</b> hot restrike <b>lamps).</b>|$|R

All the lanterns are lit in celebration on the fifteenth day of the month.|$|R
5000|$|Born {{one year}} apart, Wright and Lamp shared a June 8 birthday. Following a schoolyard fight in 1879 {{based in part}} on ethnic difference, Lamp being of German and Wright of Welsh ancestry, they became boyhood chums, {{frequently}} went boating together, and even put out a juvenile newspaper jointly. What one historian has termed their [...] "bromance" [...] endured until Lamp's premature death at age 49. <b>Lamp</b> joshingly <b>called</b> Wright [...] "Quaker Oats" [...] because of his distinctive headwear, and Wright <b>called</b> <b>Lamp</b> [...] "Pinky" [...] or [...] "Ruby" [...] because of his red hair, nicknames he would also use for the youngest of his four sons, David Wright.Five years after leaving Madison for Chicago in 1887, Wright designed for Lamp a lakefront cottage and boat landing called Rocky Roost (destroyed by fire in 1934). [...] Ten years after that, Lamp asked Wright to design a house for him. A common denominator of the two building projects is their unprepossessing locations, sites developed virtually out of nothing.|$|R

50|$|Heat lamps are {{commonly}} used in shower and bathrooms to warm bathers and in food-preparation areas of restaurants to keep food warm before serving. They are also commonly used for animal husbandry. Lights used for poultry are often <b>called</b> brooding <b>lamps.</b> Aside from young birds, other types of animals which can benefit from heat lamps include reptiles, amphibians, insects, arachnids, and the young of some mammals.|$|R
50|$|The first {{lighters}} {{were converted}} flintlock pistols that used gunpowder. One {{of the first}} lighters was invented by the German chemist named Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner in 1823 and was often <b>called</b> Döbereiner's <b>lamp.</b> This lighter worked by passing flammable hydrogen gas, produced within the lighter by a chemical reaction, over a platinum metal catalyst which in turn caused it to ignite and give off {{a great amount of}} heat and light.|$|R
40|$|A murine {{monoclonal}} anti-DNA antibody, PME 77, with specificity for double-stranded DNA, {{has previously}} been shown to react with a protein(s) present at the surface of such cells involved in lupus pathogenesis as human glomeruli, T and B lymphocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets. Mild elastase treatment of lymphoid cells from non-autoimmune (CBA/ca or BALB/c) mice releases a series of crossreactive polypeptides (34, 33, 17, 16, and 14 kDa) recognized by PME 77. These polypeptides are not formed after treatment of the same cells with papain or trypsin. When lymphoid cells from autoimmune [MRL-lpr/lpr or (NZB X NZW) F 1 B/W] mice are treated with elastase, trypsin, or papain, PME 77 detects, in all supernatants, a single polypeptide of about 55 kDa. Antibodies present in the sera of autoimmune MRL-lpr/lpr and B/W mice and IgG eluted from kidneys of MRL-lpr/lpr mice react with the same polypeptides. Neither sera nor eluted IgG of normal BALB/c mice react with these polypeptides. These results suggest that an altered cell-surface protein(s), which we <b>call</b> <b>LAMP</b> [for lupus-associated membrane protein(s) ], {{may be involved in}} lupus pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} work, a murine monoclonal anti-DNA antibody (PME 77) with specificity for double-stranded DNA {{has been}} found to bind five polypeptides (34, 33, 17, 16, and 14 kDa) that are expressed at the surface of several human cell types involved in lupus pathogenesis. To determine more precisely the nature of the antigens recognized by the PME 77 monoclonal antibody, and to release cell-surface-accessible fragments, we used a mild, controlled elastase treatment. We isolated several of these polypeptides by immunoaffinity chromatography. A polyclonal antibody was prepared by immunizing a rabbit with a mixture of these polypeptides (17, 16, and 14 kDa) adsorbed on nitrocellulose. This antibody was shown to react with 17 -, 16 -, and 14 -kDa polypeptides. This antibody does not bind to double-stranded DNA, suggesting that most of the immunogenic determinants of these polypeptides are not shared by double-stranded DNA. Of six human systemic lupus erythematosus sera tested, all contained antibodies that recognized this cell-surface protein(s) and crossreacted with double-stranded DNA. We suggest that this protein(s) be <b>called</b> <b>LAMP</b> [lupus-associated membrane protein(s) ]...|$|R
