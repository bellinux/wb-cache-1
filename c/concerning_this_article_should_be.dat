40|$|The {{meaning of}} {{employee}} engagement is ambiguous among both academic researchers and among practitioners {{who use it}} in conversations with clients. We show that the term is used at different times to refer to psychological states, traits, and behaviors {{as well as their}} antecedents and outcomes. Drawing on diverse relevant literatures, we offer a series of propositions about (a) psychological state engagement; (b) behavioral engagement; and (c) trait engagement. In addition, we offer propositions regarding the effects of job attributes and leadership as main effects on state and behavioral engagement and as moderators of the relationships among the 3 facets of engagement. We conclude with thoughts about the measurement of the 3 facets of engagement and potential antecedents, especially measurement via employee surveys.

40|$|Within {{the context}} of the 50 th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and specif-ically as it {{pertains}} to the tenets of Title VII, Lindsey, King, Dunleavy, McCausland, and Jones (2013) state: ”This focal article raises and addresses critical issues regard-ing a yet unanswered question: How can organizational researchers and practitioners contribute to the ultimate goal of eradicat-ing employment discrimination ” (p. 391). We argue that in {{the context of}} employment testing and selection, at least as per the dis-parate impact theory of discrimination, this question is the wrong one—certainly as framed by Lindsey et al. To the contrary, instead of holding up the ”eradication of employment discrimination ” as our ultimate goal, perhaps we should continue to focus on the development, implementation, and support of the best (i. e., most job-related and valid) employment practices possible. This is because employment discrimina-tion, as per the disparate impact theory of discrimination, pertains to the use of employment devices that in the presence of adverse impact, are not job related. More-over, we believe Lindsey et al. ’s treatment of this issue suffers from a lack of scien-tific and technical precision that clouds Correspondence <b>concerning</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>should</b> b...|$|R

40|$|The central {{premise of}} <b>this</b> <b>article</b> is that {{organizations}} have {{social and economic}} interests in building policies and practices that support lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered (LGBT) workers. This argument is based on empirical evidence that (a) LGBT workers continue to face discrimination at work from which they are not protected under federal law, and (b) discrimination has negative consequences for individual’s mental and physical health, and on reasoning that (c) organizations share responsibility for the social good of the communities in which they operate. We offer practical suggestions for creating LGBT-supportive organizations and propose that industrial–organizational psychologists have an ethical obligation to support such efforts. The United States has enacted federal leg-islation prohibiting discrimination in the workplace {{on the basis of}} a variety of demo-graphic factors. The United States has been slow, however, to enact legislation pro-hibiting discrimination against those who identify themselves as lesbian, gay, bisex-ual, or transgendered (LGBT). A substan-tial body of evidence has accumulated demonstrating that LGBT individuals face unequal treatment on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity in employment practices, and that the expe-rience of such discrimination has conse-quences for well-being and organizational outcomes. Our contention is that, even in the absence of federal legislation protecting Correspondence <b>concerning</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>should</b> b...|$|R
40|$|The aimof {{this study}} is to test the {{differences}} in quality and frequency of conflictmanagement behavior {{as a function of the}} interaction between task and communication medium, and practice time in continuing groups that work over two different media: computer mediated communication (CMC) and face to face communication (FTF). Conflict management behavior is studied through observed behavior and categorized by experts. Two conflict management behavior categories are differentiated: positive and negative conflict manage-ment behavior. A laboratory experiment was carried out comparing 12 groups of 4 members each, working over two communication media (6 groups FTF and 6 groups over CMC). Groups performed three types of tasks (idea-generation tasks, intellective tasks, and mixed-motive tasks) during weekly sessions over a 2 -month period. Results obtained for the idea-generation task show that negative conflict management is significantly higher in CMC than in FTF. For the groups working on intellective tasks, positive conflict management is signifi-cantly higher in FTF than in CMC. Conversely, negative conflict management is signifi-cantly higher in CMC than in FTF. No significant differences appear in positive or in nega-tive conflict management on the mixed-motive task. The effect of time on conflict management behaviors in both communication media, and for intellective tasks, does not follow the hypothesized direction. In fact, in CMC, positive conflict management decreases 481 AUTHORS’NOTE:We gratefully acknowledge the help of Gloria Gonzalez in performing the statistical analyses and the useful comments from the anonymous referees who reviewed a previous version of <b>this</b> <b>article.</b> Correspondence <b>concerning</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>should</b> b...|$|R
40|$|Malfeasant {{behaviors}} {{on tests}} may takeone of two forms—cheating or response distortion. Cheating {{is associated with}} ability and knowledge tests, and response distortion is associated with noncognitive/personality measures. Pursuant to the cheating and response distortion-related questions posed by Tippins (2009), {{the objective of the}} present article is to present a summary of the perti-nent results of a study (i. e., Arthur, Glaze, Villado, & Taylor, 2008) that was designed to (a) investigate the efficacy of using a speeded test format to address concerns about cheating on an unproctored Internet-based cognitive ability test and (b) docu-ment {{the extent to which the}} magnitude of response distortion on two unproctored Internet testing (UIT) personality measures was similar to or different from that reported for proctored personality measures in the extant literature. Cheating on Cognitive Ability Tests It is not unreasonable to assume that cheat-ing can and does occur in employment test-ing. Although we were unable to locate any published empirical studies on the preva-lence of cheating in employment testing, the prevalence of cheating in educational settings seems to be quite widespread. For example, reviews by Cizek (1999) and Whitley (1998) indicate that approximately half of all college students reported cheating on an exam at least once during their college education. Furthermore, it seems reasonable that the prevalence of cheating is likely to be exacerbated with the use of UIT because proctoring is the primary means by which cheating is curtailed. Several techniques to prevent and detect cheating are noted by Tippins. As yet another potential technique, Arthur et al. (2009) investigated the efficacy of the use of speeded tests that, by virtue of their time constraints, may serve to curtail the anticipated cheating behaviors. Of course, this is predicated on the assumption that a speeded administration is consonant Correspondence <b>concerning</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>should</b> b...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{increased}} response effort on levels of hand mouthing, leisure engagement, and adaptive elbow flexion were investigated with 2 {{individuals who had}} been diagnosed with profound disabilities. Arm restraints designed to alter the amount of physical effort necessary to engage in hand mouthing were used. Results indicated that the treatment strategy reduced levels of hand mouthing but produced only small to moderate reductions in levels of leisure engagement and adaptive elbow flexion. At follow-up, the effects of increased response effort on hand mouthing and leisure engagement were maintained for both participants; however, the restraints were associated with substantial reductions in adaptive elbow flexion for 1 participant. DESCRIPTORS: hand mouthing, self-injurious behavior, response effort, restraint Hand mouthing is a behavior problem observed in about 17 % of individuals with mental retardation, with the highest preva-lence occurring in individuals who have been diagnosed with profound disabilities (Rast & Jack, 1992). Chronic hand mouth-ing can produce a variety of injuries includ-ing tooth loss and infection of the hands and mouth (Rast & Jack). Functional analyses of chronic hand mouthing suggest that the be-havior frequently is maintained by nonsocial (i. e., automatic) sources of reinforcement (Goh et al., 1995). Behaviors maintained by automatic rein-forcement present unique treatment chal-lenges because of the difficulty in identify-ing, manipulating, and controlling the spe-cific reinforcer produced by the response.
