5|$|Formal {{schooling}} did {{not start}} in Hungary {{until the age of}} ten. Instead, governesses taught von Neumann, his brothers and his cousins. Max believed that knowledge of languages other than Hungarian was essential, so the children were tutored in English, French, German and Italian. By the age of 8, von Neumann was familiar with differential and integral calculus, but he was particularly interested in history, reading his way through Wilhelm Oncken's 46-volume Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen. A copy was contained in a private library Max purchased. One of the rooms in the apartment was converted into a library and reading room, with bookshelves from <b>ceiling</b> <b>to</b> floor.|$|E
5|$|Méliès's film studio, {{which he}} had built in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis in 1897, was a greenhouse-like {{building}} with glass walls and a glass <b>ceiling</b> <b>to</b> let in as much sunlight as possible, a concept used by most still photography studios from the 1860s onward; it was built with the same dimensions as Méliès's own Théâtre Robert-Houdin (13.5×6.6m). Throughout his film career, Méliès worked on a strict schedule of planning films in the morning, filming scenes during the brightest hours of the day, tending to the film laboratory and the Théâtre Robert-Houdin in the late afternoon, and attending performances at Parisian theaters in the evening.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of gold on the shields, {{in contrast to}} its absence {{on the rest of}} the ceiling, serves to link the <b>ceiling</b> <b>to</b> some extent with the frescoes around the walls. In the latter, gold leaf has been applied lavishly to many details and in some of the frescoes, notably those by Perugino, has been most expertly used not just to detail the robes but to highlight the folds by subtle graduation in the density of golden flecks. It is this technique that Michelangelo has picked up on and carried a step further, inspired also perhaps by the medallions that appear on a Roman triumphal arch in Botticelli's episode from the Life of Moses, showing the Punishment of the Rebels.|$|E
50|$|The {{verandah}} <b>ceilings</b> <b>to</b> {{the upper}} level are raked, with timber boarding with exposed eaves rafters; the western and eastern ends of the ceilings are finished with triangular panels with vertical battens. The verandahs have ripple iron <b>ceilings</b> <b>to</b> the ground floor.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} frontage has timber verandahs {{giving access}} to first level classrooms, with squared sheeted spandrel panels, and supported on paired columns with foliate capitals. The verandahs have battened balustrades, raked timber <b>ceilings</b> <b>to</b> {{the upper level}} and ripple iron <b>ceilings</b> <b>to</b> ground level. Part of the verandah to the east has been closed in with fibre cement sheeting.|$|R
50|$|Over the years, the {{original}} building was renovated many times. The 20 foot <b>ceilings</b> were dropped <b>to</b> 8 and 9 foot <b>ceilings</b> <b>to</b> accommodate {{air conditioning and}} had multiple uses throughout its history.|$|R
5|$|The {{interior}} of the 1883 room has been restored to its original appearance. The red oak floor is trimmed by nine inches of mop board and quarter-round, decoratively accented. The two curved and semi-circular front walls mark the two coat rooms in the original, one-room building. The rounded walls hold a chair rail and are wainscoted below the blackboards. Blackboards cover available space on the north, east, and south walls. Pressed tin extends over the ceiling and {{is used as a}} crown molding around the room on the walls from the <b>ceiling</b> <b>to</b> the top of the blackboards.|$|E
5|$|Dagen awakens {{in a cage}} in an {{abandoned}} asylum and is told that his wife Joyce will die if he doesn't save her within one hour. Joyce is chained at the neck to a steel platform that gradually pulls her down as she watches Dagen's progress. After he escapes the cage, which dangles over a floor of spikes, he begins searching for Joyce. Along the way, he finds Nina, his publicist, in a fish hook trap; Suzanne, his lawyer, in a piercing wheel; and Cale McNamara, his best friend and co-conspirator, in a hanging trap. They represent the three wise monkeys and are killed despite Dagen's efforts to save them. After removing his upper wisdom teeth to obtain the combination for a security door, Dagen finds Joyce and is forced to reenact the trap {{he claimed to have}} survived: he must drive hooks through his pectoral muscles and hoist himself up to the <b>ceiling</b> <b>to</b> deactivate her trap. He fails nonetheless, and is forced to watch as a brazen bull capsule closes around Joyce and incinerates her to death.|$|E
5|$|Spending {{and loan}} {{guarantees}} from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department {{authorized by the}} Bush and Obama administrations totaled about $11.5trillion, but only $3trillion was spent {{by the end of}} November 2009. Obama and the Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010 budget deficit would be $1.5trillion or 10.6% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4trillion or 9.9% of GDP. For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit will shrink to $1.34trillion, and the 10-year deficit will increase to $8.53trillion or 90% of GDP. The most recent increase in the U.S. debt <b>ceiling</b> <b>to</b> $17.2trillion took effect in February 2014. On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings. By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.|$|E
30|$|The DINDs {{should move}} {{on the walls and}} <b>ceilings</b> <b>to</b> avoid {{interference}} with the movement of human users.|$|R
5000|$|Weight {{may cause}} <b>ceilings</b> <b>to</b> sag if the {{material}} is very heavy. Professional installers know how to avoid this, and typical sheet rock is fine when dense-packed.|$|R
50|$|Digital still {{cameras are}} now being made with in-built {{wireless}} connectivity, so that no USB cable is required; images are simply transmitted wirelessly through walls or <b>ceilings</b> <b>to</b> the computer.|$|R
5|$|The bridge {{ceiling was}} redesigned, with Michelson taking {{structural}} inspiration from a jet engine fan. Minor built a central bubble for the <b>ceiling</b> <b>to</b> give the bridge a human touch. Ostensibly, the bubble {{functioned as a}} piece of sophisticated equipment designed to inform the captain of the ship's attitude. Most of the bridge consoles, designed by Lee Cole, remained from the scrapped television series. Cole remained on the motion picture production and was responsible for much of the visual artwork created. To inform actors and series writers, Lee prepared a USS Enterprise Flight Manual as a continuity guide to control functions. It was necessary for all the main cast to be familiar with control sequences at their stations as each panel was activated by touch via heat-sensitive plates. The wattage of the light bulbs beneath the plastic console buttons was reduced from 25watts to 6watts after the generated heat began melting the controls. The seats were covered in girdle material, used because of its stretching capacity and ability to be easily dyed. For the science station, two consoles were rigged for hydraulic operation so that they could be rolled into the walls when not in use, but the system was disconnected when the crew discovered {{it would be easier to}} move them by hand.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{began with a}} stare down. Luger gained the early {{advantage}} and managed to knock Yokozuna down by kicking the ring ropes into Yokozuna's groin. Luger tried to bodyslam Yokozuna, but the sumo wrestler's weight was too much. Yokozuna knocked {{him out of the}} ring and choked him. Yokozuna had his manager, Mr. Fuji, throw him a salt bucket, which he used to attack Luger. Yokozuna wore Luger down, and after a brief comeback by the all-American, hit a leg drop on Luger and pulled him to the corner for a Banzai Drop. After Yokozuna missed, Luger succeeded in bodyslamming Yokozuna, and he attacked Mr. Fuji when the manager tried to get involved. Luger knocked Yokozuna out of the ring with a forearm smash, and followed this up by attacking Jim Cornette. Yokozuna was counted out, but he retained the title because championships change hands only by pinfall or submission. Several faces came to the ring to celebrate with Luger as red, white and blue balloons fell from the <b>ceiling</b> <b>to</b> celebrate the victory.|$|E
25|$|Fifty tramcars {{were made}} {{available}} for operation through the tunnel. They possessed a -long and -wide all-steel superstructure with double-sided semi-open entrances at the ends. Power was drawn from an iron rail on the <b>ceiling,</b> <b>to</b> which the car roof's -high pantograph would attach. The cars were also fitted with rod pantographs for street operation.|$|E
50|$|Dropped {{ceilings}} and ceiling tiles {{were being used}} in Japan for aesthetic reasons {{as early as the}} Muromachi Period (1337 to 1573). Blackfriars Theater in London, England, built in 1596, had dropped <b>ceilings</b> <b>to</b> aid acoustics.|$|R
50|$|Finally, hallway transom {{windows in}} each {{classroom}} (put {{in place for}} ventilation when the campus had no air conditioning) will be removed. This will allow the hallway <b>ceilings</b> <b>to</b> be lowered and lighting to be improved and upgraded.|$|R
50|$|The tavern is {{also known}} for its {{tradition}} of placing cardboard shamrocks {{on the walls and}} <b>ceilings</b> <b>to</b> memorialize the names of its favored customers. Among the famous names with shamrocks are Tommy Lasorda, Kiefer Sutherland, Ronald Reagan and Cary Grant.|$|R
25|$|During {{the time}} the F-102A was in service, several new wing designs were used to {{experiment}} with the application of increased conical camber to the wings. Ultimately, a design was selected that actually increased elevon area, reduced takeoff speed, improved the supersonic L/D ratio and increased the aircraft's <b>ceiling</b> <b>to</b> 56,000ft (17,069m). A modification was required to the landing gear doors due to the wing redesign.|$|E
25|$|The only {{openings}} in the lower level were two iron barred windows, two feet wide and six inches (152mm) high, and {{an opening in the}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>to</b> the upper room with a heavy wooden door. The upper room had two larger iron barred windows, two feet wide by one foot tall, along with a heavy oak door. Outside the door was a small platform with a stairway down to ground level.|$|E
25|$|The Federal District {{does not}} have a constitution, like the states of the Union, but rather a Statute of Government. As part of its recent changes in autonomy, the budget is {{administered}} locally; it is proposed by the head of government and approved by the Legislative Assembly. Nonetheless, it is the Congress of the Union that sets the <b>ceiling</b> <b>to</b> internal and external public debt issued by the Federal District.|$|E
50|$|Wirepe, {{designed}} by M.B. Halligan for architect Walter Traill, used deep verandahs and high <b>ceilings</b> <b>to</b> elicit a homestead atmosphere, with fine corbelled chimneys and cedar shingles. The brickwork is of Colonial Bond design, {{and the house}} sits {{at the heart of}} the Ku-ring-gai heritage precinct on Hastings Road.|$|R
5000|$|The Life Safety Code (NFPA 101) and Section 803.1 of the International Building Code limit {{finishes}} for {{interior walls}} and <b>ceilings</b> <b>to</b> materials in three classes (A, B, or C, with A being the lowest flame spread and C being the highest) and gives greater restrictions for certain rooms: ...|$|R
50|$|The Condos feature: Gas Stoves, Fireplaces, 9 ft - 12 ft <b>ceiling</b> heights, Floor <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> windows, Spacious balconies, HVAC, deeded {{parking and}} storage.|$|R
25|$|Other {{areas of}} the museum contain {{repositories}} of life from thousands and millions {{of years in the}} past. The Whale Bone Storage Room is a cavernous space in which powerful winches come down from the <b>ceiling</b> <b>to</b> move the giant fossil bones about. The museum attic upstairs includes even more storage facilities, such as the Elephant Room, while the tusk vault and boar vault are downstairs from the attic.|$|E
25|$|By the 1980s, {{the ceiling}} was {{obscured}} by decades of what {{was thought to be}} coal and diesel smoke. Spectroscopic examination revealed that it was mostly tar and nicotine from tobacco smoke. A 12-year restoration effort, completed in autumn 1996, restored the <b>ceiling</b> <b>to</b> its original design. A single dark patch above the Michael Jordan Steakhouse was left untouched by renovators to remind visitors of the grime that once covered the ceiling.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Linda Atiyeh {{acquired}} the historic property and began extensive renovations, including removing a drop <b>ceiling</b> <b>to</b> uncover original skylights, un-bricking original windows, installing new electrical, heating/cooling and lighting systems, painting and restoring the exterior storefront, and uncovering and restoring the original wood floor using vintage floor planks reclaimed from a historic building in Kentucky. Gallery 30 opened for {{business in the}} newly restored building at 26-28 York Street in 2013.|$|E
50|$|Each flat has {{decorative}} plaster <b>ceilings</b> <b>to</b> most rooms, and multi-paned French {{doors open}} {{from the main}} bedroom to the enclosed sleep-out. Doors, architraves and skirtings are finished in varnished timber, with plate rails to the living room. Internal walls are plastered, with paint or paper finish, and the kitchen has been refitted.|$|R
5000|$|Priests or ministers, and choirs wear red vestments, and {{in modern}} times, the custom has {{extended}} to the lay people of the congregation wearing red clothing in celebration as well. Red banners are often hung from walls or <b>ceilings</b> <b>to</b> symbolize the blowing of the [...] "mighty wind" [...] and the free movement of the Spirit.|$|R
40|$|In most {{developed}} countries, {{regulators have}} imposed loan <b>ceilings</b> <b>to</b> subsidized microfinance institutions (MFIs). Micro-entrepreneurs {{in need of}} above-ceiling loans are left with the co-financing option, which means securing the aboveceiling share of the loan with a regular bank, and getting a ceiling-high loan from the MFI. Co-financing is attractive to MFIs because {{it allows them to}} free-ride on the regular banks' screening process. Therefore, loan ceilings can have the perverse effect of facilitating the co-financing of large projects at the expense of micro-entrepreneurs who need below-ceiling loans only. This is the gist of our theoretical model. We test the predictions of this model by exploiting the natural experiment of a French MFI that became subject to the French EUR 10, 000 loan ceiling in April 2009. Difference-in-differences probit estimations confirm that imposing loan <b>ceilings</b> <b>to</b> MFIs can have unexpected and socially harmful consequences. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
25|$|An {{upper level}} {{was added to}} the cloister between 1350 and 1360, reached by a monumental stairway. The {{builders}} added a wooden <b>ceiling</b> <b>to</b> the lower level and decorated the brightly painted panels with biblical scenes, fantastic animals, and scenes of daily life. Only half of the paintings remain today, and the bright colours have been faded by oxidation, but they provide a remarkable look at medieval life and the medieval imagination.|$|E
25|$|In the {{renovation}} of the 1980s Quinlan Terry introduced large Doric order columns to this room in the door surrounds and designed a very large Palladian overmantel for the fireplace with small double Doric columns on each side with the royal arms above. Terry also added an ornate gilded <b>ceiling</b> <b>to</b> give the rooms a more stately look. Carved into the plasterwork above the door leading to the Pillared Room {{is a tribute to}} Margaret Thatcher: a straw-carrying 'thatcher'.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{roof trusses}} are four arch-braced roof trusses forming the four bays in {{the centre of}} the Church. At the west end, above the gallery, further trusses were altered in the 17th or 18th centuries and are divided by a collar-beam truss. At the chancel end the roof is {{panelled}} over with a barrel shaped <b>ceiling</b> <b>to</b> provide a 'canopy of honour' of 15th century design, although most of the fabric of this is now of later date.|$|E
50|$|Polished plaster {{is mainly}} used internally, on walls and <b>ceilings,</b> <b>to</b> give a finish {{that looks like}} {{polished}} marble, travertine, or limestone. Such plasters are usually applied over a primer and basecoat base, from one to four layers. They are finished (burnished) with a specialised steel trowel to a smooth glass-like sheen. Polished plaster is usually sealed with a protective layer of wax.|$|R
50|$|The {{property}} {{has been}} continuously occupied and has changed hands several times since 1948, {{with very little}} structural upkeep until renovations began in 2007. Along with necessary safety installations (pipes replaced, fire extinguishers installed) the Linden Centre added glass <b>ceilings</b> <b>to</b> protect original artwork from the wind, rain, and sun damage, re-levelled floors and walkways, and restored the original living spaces.|$|R
50|$|The stairs lead to {{a generous}} foyer on the upper floor which links the two wings of rooms, and has pressed metal ceilings. Arched timber double doors {{to the south of}} the foyer {{lead to a}} {{corridor}} with a delicately patterned plaster ceiling. The corridor gives access to small rooms, each with similar <b>ceilings</b> <b>to</b> the corridor, and metal ceiling roses.|$|R
