The O <b>chromosomal</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> of Drosophila subobs-cura have been monitored at a southern Palearctic locality experiencing sustained climate warming since the mid- 1970 s.

These findings are consistent with results from another population of D. subobscura, which is also undergoing climate warming, and are in accord with what would be expected from latitudinal and seasonal patterns of the various inver-sions.

The karyotype of the house mouse normally consists of 40 telocentric chromosomes, but in certain regions in Europe, mice with karyotypes containing fewer than 40 chromosomes can be found. The reduction in chromosome number is due to centric fusion (Robertsonian translocation) of two telocentrics into a single metacentric. Klein’s group found populations with metacentric chromosomes in different regions of Europe, but concentrated its effort on the system of metacentrics in southern Germany. An in-depth study of these populations revealed subdivision into subpopulations, which correlated with that established by the studies of H2 polymorphism.|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence regarding {{the role of}} chromosomal inversions in relevant biological processes such as local adaptation and speciation. A {{classic example of the}} adaptive role of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> is given by the clines of inversion frequencies in Drosophila subobscura, repeatable across continents. Nevertheless, not much is known about the molecular variation associated with these polymorphisms. We characterized the genetic content of ca. 600 individuals from nine European populations following a latitudinal gradient by analysing 19 microsatellite loci from two autosomes (J and U) and the sex chromosome (A), taking into account their chromosomal inversions. Our results clearly demonstrate the molecular genetic uniformity within a given chromosomal inversion across a large latitudinal gradient, particularly from Groningen (Netherlands) in the north to Málaga (Spain) in the south, experiencing highly diverse environmental conditions. This low genetic differentiation within the same gene arrangement across the nine European populations is consistent with the local adaptation hypothesis for th evolutionof <b>chromosomal</b> <b>polymorphisms.</b> We also show the effective role of chromosomal inversions in maintaining different genetic pools within these inverted genomic regions even in the presence of high gene flow. Inversions represent thus an important barrier to gene flux and can help maintain specific allelic combinations with positive effects on fitness. Consistent patterns of microsatellite allele-inversion linkage disequilibrium particularly in loci within inversions were also observed. Finally, we identified areas within inversions presenting clina...|$|R

40|$|<b>Chromosomal</b> {{inversion}} <b>polymorphism</b> play a {{major role}} in the evolutionary dynamics of populations and species because of their effects on the patterns of genetic variability in the genomic regions within inversions. Though there is compelling evidence for the adaptive character of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>polymorphisms,</b> the mechanisms responsible for their maintenance in natural populations is not fully understood. For this type of analysis, Drosophila subobscura is a good model species as it has a rich and extensively studied <b>chromosomal</b> inversion <b>polymorphism</b> system. Here, we examine the patterns of DNA variation in two natural populations segregating for chromosomal arrangements that differentially affect the surveyed genomic region; in particular, we analyse both nucleotide substitutions and insertion/deletion variations in the genomic region encompassing the odorant-binding protein genes Obp 83 a and Obp 83 b (Obp 83 region). We show that the two main gene arrangements are genetically differentiated, but are consistent with a monophyletic origin of inversions. Nevertheless, these arrangements interchange some genetic information, likely by gene conversion. We also find that the frequency spectrum-based tests indicate that the pattern of nucleotide variation is not at equilibrium; this feature probably reflects the rapid increase in the frequency of the new gene arrangement promoted by positive selection (that is an adaptive change). Furthermore, a comparative analysis of polymorphism and divergence patterns reveals a relaxation of the functional constraints at the Obp 83 b gene, which might be associated with particular ecological or demographic features of the Canary island endemic species D. guanch...|$|R

Thus, using both in the analysis it is possible to increase the sample size. However, it is important to verify whether there are significant differences between both groups or not. The aim of this research has been to statistically compare the results of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>polymorphism</b> of both groups. We have used data from Avala Mountain (Serbia) where D. subobscura flies were collected from the 30 th May to the 5 th June 2011. Avala is located 18 km south of Belgrade and the trapping place is a forest with polydominant communities of Fagetum submontanum Table 1.

Attempts have been made to correlate the frequencies of these polymorphisms with certain demographic variables, information about which was collected from the participants using questionnaires. Other genetic markers, detectable from blood samples, have also been studied, with a view to comparing the patterns of variability shown by these in the population, with those of the less well studied chromosome variants. Demoaraphic information was collected from each person concerning his or her age, sex, occupation and geographic origins. Parental ages and birth order data were also collected in the case of newborn infants. No consistent correlations were observed between any of the chromosome variants and any of the demographic factors. However, there were indications of an association {{of the total number of}} variants found per individual karyotype with sex and with age. The results obtained in this study have been compared with those of published reports of chromosome variability. The conclusion drawn from this comparison is that, although there is evidence that a degree of similarity of frequency exists between populations, the extent of such similarity is extremely difficult to quantify objectively. Information concerning the molecular nature of chromosomes, and their polymorphisms, has been reviewed with the intention of revealing any theoretical basis there may be for an adaptive significance of the variants. The incidence of other chromosomal variations in human populations has also been described, in order to detect any evidence that may exist for a biological or evolutionary significance of any type of chromosomal variability.
