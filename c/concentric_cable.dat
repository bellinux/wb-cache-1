5000|$|In {{single-ended}} single-phase systems {{where the}} Earth and neutral are combined (TN-C, and {{the part of}} TN-C-S systems which uses a combined neutral and earth core), {{if there is a}} contact problem in the PEN conductor, then all parts of the earthing system beyond the break will rise to the potential of the L conductor. In an unbalanced multi-phase system, the potential of the earthing system will move towards that of the most loaded line conductor. Such a rise in the potential of the neutral beyond the break is known as a neutral inversion. Therefore, TN-C connections must not go across plug/socket connections or flexible cables, where there is a higher probability of contact problems than with fixed wiring. There is also a risk if a cable is damaged, which can be mitigated by the use of <b>concentric</b> <b>cable</b> construction and multiple earth electrodes. Due to the (small) risks of the lost neutral raising 'earthed' metal work to a dangerous potential, coupled with the increased shock risk from proximity to good contact with true earth, the use of TN-C-S supplies is banned in the UK for caravan sites and shore supply to boats, and strongly discouraged for use on farms and outdoor building sites, and in such cases it is recommended to make all outdoor wiring TT with RCD and a separate earth electrode.|$|E
40|$|The {{optimization}} of a HTS {{cable design}} {{with respect to}} AC-losses is of crucial importance for the economic viability of the respective concept. However the experimental determination of AC-losses is not straightforward since for short cable samples the distribution of current among the super-conducting tapes is mainly determined by the contact resistances of the individual tapes. The resulting inhomogeneous current distribution definitely falsifies the results. To solve this experimental problem we present a new experimental technique. The setup is a 2 m-long three phase <b>concentric</b> <b>cable</b> model for which, within each phase, the superconducting tapes (up to 30) are connected in series. The Cu-braid backwards conductors were assembled in a rotational symmetric cage type arrangement, such that their self fields at the cable cancel. If experimental peculiarities of this setup, as the strong inductive coupling between the phases and the suitable positioning of the voltage contact leads, are correctly taken into account, the currents can be controlled independently and the electrical properties of the cable can be measured unambiguously. In this paper preliminary results are presented. The work {{is part of the}} German government funded cable project AMPACITY (1 km / 20 kV/ 2 kA...|$|E
40|$|Proposed {{actuator}} handle comprises two normally <b>concentric</b> rings, <b>cables,</b> and pulleys arranged {{such that}} relative displacement of rings from concentricity results in pulling of cable and consequent actuation of associated mechanism. Unlike conventional actuator handles like levers on farm implements, actuated {{from one or}} two directions only, proposed handle reached from almost any direction and actuated by pulling or pushing inner ring in any direction with respect to outer ring. Flanges installed on inner ring to cover gap between inner ring and housing to prevent clothing from being caught...|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, in bicycles, shifter cables are {{anchored}} on the shifter {{with a small}} cylindrical nipple, <b>concentric</b> {{with the}} <b>cable.</b> Bicycle brake nipples however, vary between mountain bikes (MTB), with straight handlebars, and road bikes, with drop-handlebars. MTB bikes use a barrel-shaped (cylindrical) nipple to anchor the brake cable at the brake lever, while road bikes have a pear-shaped nipple. Some replacement brake cables for bicycles come with both styles, one on each end. The unneeded end is cut off and discarded upon installation.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{electrical}} {{properties of the}} proximal tubule of the in vivo Necturus kidney were investigated by injecting current (as rectangular waves) into the lumen or into the epithelium of single tubules and by studying the resulting changes of transepithelial (VL) and/or cell membrane potential (V c) at various distances from the source. In some experiments paired measurements of VL and Vc were performed at two abscissas x and x'. The luminal length constant of about 1, 030 pm was shown to provide a good estimate of the transepithelial resistance, specific resistance (Ra'E = 420 ~. cm 2) and/or per unit length (ram = 1. 3 X 104 ~. cm). The apparent intraepithelial length constant was subject to distortions arising from concomitant current spread in the lumen. The resistances of luminal membrane (rL), basolateral membrane (rs), and shunt pathway (rs) were estimated by two independent methods at 3. 5 • 104, 1. 2 • 104, and 1. 7 X 104 ~. cm, respectively. The corresponding specific resistances were close to 1, 200, 600, and 600 ~. cm 2. There are two main conclusions of this study. (a) The resistances of cell membranes and shunt pathway are of the same order of magnitude. The figure of the shunt resistance is at variance {{with the notion that}} the proximal tubule of Necturus is a leaky epithelium. (b) A rigorous assessment of the conductive properties of <b>concentric</b> cylindrical double <b>cables</b> (such as renal tubules) requires that electrical interactions arising from one cable to another be taken into account. Appropriate equations were developed to deal with this problem...|$|R
