The research evaluated the means in which mild variations in the polymer properties could be modified during the mixing process so that the final mixed compound met the desired rheological parameters. The initial work developed a model to measure the viscosity of the material in the internal mixer during the mixing process. The model assumed the mixer could be treated as two <b>concentric</b> <b>rotary</b> viscometers. The model had a rotor speed dependence which {{was caused by the}} assumption not being valid. However, this led to the work continuing in a modified form. It was felt that at a given rotor speed and temperature the torque measured on the rotors would be proportional to the viscosity of the material. This was found to be correct and therefore work continued using this principle. Programs were developed for internal mixers with variable speed rotors and fixed speed rotors. The programs were evaluated using natural rubber with different viscosities and were found to be capable of modifying the polymers to obtain a final mixed compound to a target viscosity. The control program was also used to mix a series of batches at different processing conditions. The rheological properties of these batches were compared to a similar group mixed to a specification based on unit work. The result was the control system gave more rheologically uniform material...|$|R

Five different horizontal and three <b>rotary</b> <b>screening</b> devices were tested using five different screen hole diameters (3. 15, 8, 16, 45, 63 mm, round holes).

Highest conformity with the reference values is given for measurements with an image analysis system, whereas for all machines with horizontal screens the median value of the size distribution only reached between one-third to half of the reference median value for the particle length distribution.

40|$|Researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory {{have been}} {{developing}} {{a method for}} measuring color quality in textile products using a tri-stimulus color camera system. Initial results of the Imaging Tristimulus Colorimeter (ITC) were reported during 1999. These results showed that the projection onto convex sets (POCS) approach to color estimation could be applied to complex printed patterns on textile products with high accuracy and repeatability. Image-based color sensors used for on-line measurement are not colorimetric by nature and require a non-linear transformation of the component colors based on the spectral properties of the incident illumination, imaging sensor, and the actual textile color. Our earlier work reports these results for a broad-band, smoothly varying D 65 standard illuminant. To move the measurement to the on-line environment with continuously manufactured textile webs, the illumination source becomes problematic. The spectral content of these light sources varies substantially from the D 65 standard illuminant and can greatly impact the measurement performance of the POCS system. Although absolute color measurements are difficult to make under different illumination, referential measurements to monitor color drift provide a useful indication of product quality. Modifications to the ITC system have been implemented to enable the study of different light sources.

30|$|The entire OPV device stack can be {{directly}} printed into any kind of two-dimensional shape using mass-manufacturing printing technologies, namely gravure, flexography and screen printing [2, 13]. These printing methods and the materials used for printing however set some technical boundary conditions for the layout design, which are especially important for the electrical performance of the modules. In this work, the technical boundaries for the custom-shaped OPVs were determined by the processing method, the used equipment and materials. First, the overall feature size was defined to be 120 by 130  mm. This was limited by the engraved area of the gravure printing plate {{and the size of}} the evaporation mask. Secondly, the dimensions of the individual OPV cells were influenced by the electrode materials. The length of the cell was limited to 50  mm due to the thermal evaporating process of LiF/Al where the fine features of the shadow mask are prone for bending, and the width of the cells were fixed into 5  mm due to the sheet resistance of ITO [5]. Additionally, the precision of the printed image is influenced by the dimensional accuracy of the printed layer i.e. the shrinking/spreading of the ink thus the dimensions of the test prints were compared with the layout. In R 2 R <b>rotary</b> <b>screen</b> printing of ITO, the dimensions in machine (MD) and cross-machine direction (CD) perpendicular to the direction of printing deviated + 0.2 % (MD) and + 0.1 % (CD).

However, the evaporation phases can be replaced with wet deposition methods such as printing especially when an inverted device stack is used. In that case, for instance PEDOT:PSS and silver inks can be printed as hole transport layer and hole contact layers using screen printing and flexography printing [7, 9, 19]. Here, sputtered ITO was patterned in R 2 R <b>rotary</b> <b>screen</b> printing process, and PEDOT:PSS and P 3 HT:PCBM were gravure printed using lab-scale printer. Currently, various suitable electrode and interlayer materials have been introduced for wet-chemical processing [19]. Furthermore, the alternative active materials have reached efficiencies close to 11 % [20]. The record cells with novel active materials are typically small and fabricated with non-scalable processing techniques under inert conditions whereas P 3 HT:PCBM-based modules have been widely processed under ambient conditions [19]. However, some materials that are scalable and suitable for wet-deposition under ambient air might still be prone to cause reduction of efficiency if for instance the desired layer thickness/morphology is difficult to produce in a reproducible manner. Successful demonstration made by Berny et al. shows the reduction of efficiencies from 9.3 to 4.5 % when the substrate, electrode and interlayer materials were replaced with the materials that are scalable [16]. From the fabrication point of view, it is also crucial that materials obtain uniform quality, sufficient stability and availability in larger quantities for the optimization of the printing inks and processes.

The plant is designed for 5000 person equivalent (p. e.) in winter and 8200 p. e. in summer; it is made of primary treatments (screen, sand and grit removal, buffer tank, <b>rotary</b> drum <b>screen),</b> predenitrification (220 m 3), oxidation (370 m 3) with ferric chloride dosage, membrane tank (250 m 3) equipped with Kubota plane membrane (total filtration area 3600 m 2), deoxygenation tank (115 m 3), disinfection with sodium hypochlorite, sludge thickening and dewatering by centrifugation. In 2012, on average basis the plant treated 733 m 3 d- 1 wastewater with 442 mgL- 1 COD, 253 mgL- 1 BOD, 38. 1 mgL- 1 TKN; removal efficiencies were 86 % for COD, 96 % for BOD, 93 % for TKN and 74 % for total nitrogen. Permeate flux varied in the range 4 – 24 Lm- 2 h- 1 and negative pressure in the range 85 – 300 mbar; membranes were backwashed with sodium hypochlorite once a month...|$|R
40|$|Resort Improvement District (hereafter “Discharger”) {{owns and}} {{operates}} the WWTF. 2. The WWTF includes a sewer collection system, an activated sludge treatment unit, a chlorine disinfection system, four high density polyethylene geomembrane lined storage Ponds 1 through 4, and a 60 -acre spray field. Ponds 2, 3 and 4 are new storage ponds. The disinfected secondary wastewater {{is applied to the}} spray field. 3. The Discharger proposes to make major improvements to the WWTF, including replacement of manual bar <b>screen</b> with a <b>rotary</b> drum <b>screen,</b> replacement of the activated sludge treatment unit with a membrane bioreactor package treatment system, construction of a concrete sludge drying bed, and expansion of Pond 1. Proposed WDRs Amendment 4. Approximately six acres of oak woodland were removed for the construction and expansion of the storage ponds. The removed oak woodland represents riparian habitat and habitat connectivity to upstream and downstream resources. Tree replacement is required to meet requirements of California Department of Fish and Wildlife, Bureau of Reclamation, Army Corps of Engineers, and Californi...|$|R
