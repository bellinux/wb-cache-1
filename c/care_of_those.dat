5|$|The {{process of}} {{repatriation}} {{did not end}} there, though. Upon their return to Australia the effort shifted towards placing the returned soldiers into employment, or education and taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> that were too badly injured to work. In order to meet these needs the Commonwealth established the Repatriation Department, tasked with managing the placement of returned soldiers into employment, training, education, housing. Eventually this also included the colossal task of managing the provision of war pensions, managing repatriation hospitals and convalescent homes and administering the Soldier Settlement Scheme. The total cost of these provisions was considerable, and in June 1935 it was estimated to have cost approximately £238,000,000 which {{was more than the}} total amount spent on defence during the war.|$|E
25|$|Nephrology {{concerns}} {{the diagnosis and}} treatment of kidney diseases, including electrolyte disturbances and hypertension, and the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> requiring renal replacement therapy, including dialysis and renal transplant patients. Many diseases affecting the kidney are systemic disorders not limited to the organ itself, and may require special treatment. Examples include acquired conditions such as systemic vasculitides (e.g. ANCA vasculitis) and autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus), as well as congenital or genetic conditions such as polycystic kidney disease.|$|E
25|$|Existing {{patients}} are often discharged without sufficient preparation or support. A {{greater proportion of}} people with mental disorders become homeless or go to prison. Families can often {{play a crucial role}} in the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who would typically be placed in long-term treatment centres. However, many mentally ill people are resistant to such help due to the nature of their conditions. The majority of those who would be under continuous care in long-stay psychiatric hospitals are paranoid and delusional to the point that they refuse help, believing they do not need it, which makes it difficult to treat them.|$|E

500|$|In other countries, {{there may}} not be the same distinctions made between <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with {{terminal}} illnesses and palliative care in a more general setting. [...] In such countries, the term hospice is more likely to refer to a particular type of institution, rather than specifically to care in the final months or weeks of life. End-of-life care {{is more likely to be}} included in the general term [...] "palliative care".|$|E
500|$|The fifth commandment forbids {{suicide and}} the mercy killing {{of those who}} are dying, even to {{eliminate}} suffering. The ordinary <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> facing an imminent death may not morally be withheld, according to the Church. [...] "Ordinary care" [...] refers to food, water and pain relief, and does not include [...] "extraordinary care", which refers to the use of respirators or feeding tubes that are considered discretionary. Allowing a terminally ill person to die, using painkillers that may shorten their life, or refusing extraordinary treatment to the terminally ill such as chemotherapy or radiation, are considered morally acceptable and not a violation of the fifth commandment, in accordance with the principle of double effect.|$|E
500|$|The Act for the Relief of the Poor of 1601 made parishes legally {{responsible}} for the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> within their boundaries who, through age or infirmity, were unable to work. [...] The Act essentially classified the poor into one of three groups. [...] It proposed that the able-bodied be offered work in a house of correction (the precursor of the workhouse), where the [...] "persistent idler" [...] was to be punished. [...] It also proposed the construction of housing for the impotent poor, {{the old and the}} infirm, although most assistance was granted through a form of poor relief known as outdoor relief– money, food, or other necessities given to those living in their own homes, funded by a local tax on the property of the wealthiest in the parish.|$|E

500|$|Among other {{theories}} about the case, early speculation was that the girl could have been murdered {{by a member of}} her family. A criminologist stated that it did not seem likely that she would have been [...] "murdered by a stranger," [...] according to statistics of [...] similar cases. The fact that she had been disposed of along with personal items reinforced this theory. The fact that there were not yet any tips from relatives with information about the child supported the idea that family members were involved with the disposal of the body—and possibly with her death. Investigators feared for other children who may have been in the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> that disposed of the body, as they could be in danger. A different theory held that the child's family members might also be deceased, having faced a similar demise.|$|E
2500|$|Paul, {{was asked}} a {{hypothetical}} question at a Tea Party debate by CNN host Wolf Blitzer about how society should respond if a healthy 30-year-old man who decided against buying health insurance suddenly requires intensive care for six months. Paul said it shouldn't be the government's responsibility. [...] "That's what freedom is all about, taking your own risks," [...] Paul said. Paul mentioned {{he does not}} believe society should let the aforementioned hypothetical man die but emphasized that churches and communities – rather than governments – should take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> in need.|$|E
2500|$|Mt. Juliet {{was formed}} in 1835 and {{incorporated}} as a city in 1972. According to the Mt. Juliet Chamber of Commerce, {{the name of the}} town has two possible explanations. [...] One theory is that the town was named for Julia Gleaves, a person who was renowned for taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> in need within the community. [...] The most widely accepted story is that Mt. Juliet is named for the Mount Juliet Estate, a manor house in County Kilkenny, Ireland. It is the only U.S. city with this name.|$|E

2500|$|The modern word [...] "immunity" [...] {{derives from}} the Latin immunis, meaning {{exemption}} from military service, tax payments or other public services. The first written descriptions {{of the concept of}} immunity may have been made by the Athenian Thucydides who, in 430 BC, described that when the plague hit Athens: [...] "the sick and the dying were tended by the pitying <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who had recovered, because they knew the course of the disease and were themselves free from apprehensions. For no one was ever attacked a second time, or not with a fatal result". The term [...] "immunes", is also found in the epic poem [...] "Pharsalia" [...] written around 60 B.C. by the poet Marcus Annaeus Lucanus to describe a North African tribe's resistance to snake venom.|$|E
