Castellated beams were integrated into the structure to reduce the weight of steel used and to encourage air movement. [...] The exposed concrete slab was polished and used as the finish floor surface. The castellated steel beam structure, chosen for strength, lower cost, and reduced material was left exposed and painted white, allowing light, air and services to circulate. The metal <b>cable</b> <b>tray</b> system corrals electrical and data cabling also serve as the support for the light fixtures. Ceiling mounted acoustical panels double as light reflectors. Acoustical wall panels provide additional noise damping and a place to pinup sketches.|$|E

5000|$|Ferrous <b>cable</b> <b>trays</b> expand {{with the}} {{increasing}} heat from accidental fire. This has been proven by the German Otto-Graf-Institut Test Report III.1-80999/Tei/tei [...] "Supplementary Test On The Topic Of Mechanical Force Acting On Cable Penetration Firestop Systems During The Fire Test", dated 23 October 1984, to dislodge [...] "soft" [...] firestops, such as those made of fibrous insulations with rubber coatings. This also applies to any silicone foam seals, but is easily remedied {{through the use of}} firestop mortars of sufficient compression strength and thickness, as shown above. Also, some building codes mandate that penetrants such as <b>cable</b> <b>trays</b> are installed in such ways so as to avoid their contribution to the collapse of a firewall.|$|R

5000|$|Each {{of these}} test {{procedures}} have very similar fire endurance regimes and heat transfer limitations. Differences include the hose-stream tests, which {{are unique to}} Canada and the United States, whereas Germany includes a very rigorous impact test during the fire for firewalls. Germany is unique in including heat induced expansion and collapse of ferrous cable trays into account for firestops, resulting in the favouring of firestop mortars, which tend to hold the penetrating <b>cable</b> <b>tray</b> in place, whereas [...] "softseals", typically made of rockwool and elastomeric toppings, have been demonstrated in testing by Otto Graf institute to be torn open and rendered inoperable when the <b>cable</b> <b>tray</b> expands, pushes in and then collapses. Spin-offs from these basic tests cover closures, firestops and more. Furnace operations, thermocoupling and reporting requirements remain uniform within each country.|$|E
