5000|$|The buses that {{provided}} the service were old, secondhand transit buses or highway coaches that were modified inside, with almost all passenger seats removed and replaced by beds. They lacked bathrooms. [...] In 1977, the schedule included two San Francisco-New York-Boston trips per week in each direction, and the journey took three or four days. There were weekly departures from the Bay Area north to Vancouver, B.C. and south to Los Angeles. As of 1977, the company had four ticket outlets in the Bay Area. [...] In addition to its low fares, about half those of Greyhound, another feature that attracted some riders was the casual atmosphere found on the Grey Rabbit and other [...] "hippie bus" [...] lines of the 1970s, in which conversation and interaction between riders who were strangers before boarding was welcomed in a way not commonly seen on <b>conventional</b> <b>long-distance</b> bus services.|$|E

50|$|The {{purchase}} of White Trucks in 1980 {{turned out to}} be a very good step for Volvo. Suddenly, Volvo's trucks could be marketed throughout the United States, in parallel with a tailor-made programme of modern American heavy-duty trucks. When Volvo took over the truck assets of White, the White/Autocar/Western Star product programme consisted of the Road Boss (conventional) truck, the Road Commander 2 (cab-over engine) truck, the low-built Road Xpeditor 2 (cab-over engine) truck, the Autocar DC (heavy duty construction) truck, the Road Constructor 2 (construction) truck and the Western Star (<b>long-distance</b> <b>conventional</b> and cab-over engine) trucks.|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{incidence of}} follicular lymphoma (FL) compared with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCL) {{is low in}} Chinese. This {{may be due to}} a lower incidence of t(14; 18) -mediated disease, a rapid transformation of FL to DLCL, or a lower incidence of FL-prone genetic polymorphisms (e. g., bcl- 6 G 397 C). Using a <b>conventional</b> and <b>long-distance</b> polymerase chain reaction technique, we showed that 93 % (43 / 46) of Chinese FL cases are t(14; 18) related and are molecularly indistinguishable from Caucasian cases. The translocation was uncommonly found in Chinese DLCL cases (8 / 58, 14 %). Furthermore, the incidence of bcl- 6 hypermutation in FL and DLCL cases appeared to be comparable. These data do not suggest a high incidence of transformation from FL to DLCL in Chinese. Sequencing study also did not show an increased incidence of G 397 C polymorphism (heterozygote+homozygotes) in FL compared to a population with Chinese background or DLCL cases (25 + 5 % vs 30 + 4 % vs 22 + 3 %). The reasons for the lower incidence of FL in Chinese remain unanswered. © Springer-Verlag 2005. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
30|$|The lowest costs (and the cost-meeting fares) in the figure, in {{the case}} of 216 {{services}} per day, are € 0, 30 {{in the case}} of solid soil along the whole route, € 0, 36 {{in the case of}} 50 % solid soil and 50 % weak soil, and € 0, 40 in the case of 50 % solid soil, 40 % weak soil, and 10 % tunnel. A comparison with the fares of alternative modes is difficult because there is generally a wide range of fares for the same route because of revenue management. Based on the experiences of De Decker [33], the most common fares for high-speed trains would be between € 0, 15 and € 0, 25 per km, and those for <b>conventional</b> <b>long-distance</b> trains about half the HSR fares. The fares for low-cost airlines are also significantly lower than the HSR fares.|$|E
40|$|This {{communication}} {{reports the}} first ever use of the over ocean evaporation duct to implement a high-capacity radio link from the Australian mainland to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), North Queensland, Australia. <b>Conventional</b> <b>long-distance</b> radio communication techniques such as high-frequency (HF) radio, satellite, or cell phone are either too slow or too expensive to operate continuously in this situation. A microwave radio link overcomes these problems but would generally not be viable due to the limited range possible with a standard line-of-sight microwave link. This communication shows that by properly choosing the antenna height and operating frequency though, {{it is possible to}} trap signals in the ocean evaporation duct and substantially extend the propagation range. A 78 -km link that operates at a frequency of 10. 6 GHz and provides a data rate of 10 Mb/s as been established to verify the technique. The communication also provides preliminary results of the measured performance of this link and a comparison with existing radio propagation models...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBattery {{electric}} vehicles (BEVs) could reduce CO 2 emissions from {{the transport sector}} but their limited electric driving range diminishes their utility to users. The effect of the limited driving range can be reduced in multi-car households where users could choose between a BEV and a <b>conventional</b> car for <b>long-distance</b> travel. However, {{to what extent the}} driving patterns of different cars in a multi-car household’s suit the characteristics of a BEV needs further analysis. In this paper we analyse the probability of daily driving above a fixed threshold for conventional cars in current Swedish and German car driving data. We find second cars in multi-car households to require less adaptation and to be better suited for BEV adoption compared to first cars in multi-car households as well as to cars in single-car households. Specifically, the share of second cars that could fulfil all their driving is 20 percentage points higher compared to first cars and cars from single-car households. This result is stable against variation of driving range and of the tolerated number of days requiring adaptation. Furthermore, the range needed to cover all driving needs for about 70 % of the vehicles is only 220 km for second cars compared to 390 km for the average car. We can further confirm that second cars have higher market viability from a total cost of ownership perspective. Here, the second cars achieve a 10 percentage points higher market share compared to first cars, and to cars in single-car households for Swedish economic conditions, while for Germany the corresponding figure is 2 percentage points. Our results are important for understanding the market viability of current and near-future BEVs...|$|R
