50|$|<b>Croatia-Italy</b> {{relations}} {{refer to}} the bilateral relationship between Croatia and Italy. Diplomatic relations among two countries were established on January 17, 1992 following Croatia's independence from SFR Yugoslavia.|$|E
50|$|Blue Line International is a ferry company {{owned by}} the Croatia-based SEM Maritime Company (SMC). It {{operates}} two car/passenger ferries between Croatia and Italy. The Blue Line brand was established in 2003 as a marketing name for SMC's <b>Croatia—Italy</b> services, coinciding with {{the purchase of the}} MV Ancona.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{globalization}} and remnants of historical significance (i.e. <b>Croatia-Italy</b> relations, Illyrian Provincial nationalism, etc.) {{many people in}} Croatia have American, French, Swedish, Finnish, German, Italian and English first names (given names). However due to the alphabetical limitation of the Croatian language many names take on new pronunciations, are respelled, or are restructured {{to comply with the}} country's naming customs. Uncharacteristic names are never declined in the Croatian language, and by nationality of origin include: (American): Thomas, Charles, Max, Jacob, William, Isabella, Emma, Madison, Matthew, Alexander; (German): Hans, Peter, Stephan, Gerhard, Edith, Gabriele, Monika, Wolfgang, Dennis; (French): Jean-Louis, Lucus, Marie, Clément, Camille, Baptiste, Léonie, Julien, Françoise, Jeanne; (Italian): Alessandro, Andrea, Alessia, Claudia, Christian, Riccardo, Luca, Matteo, Leonardo, Sofia...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 208 {{polycyclic}} aromatic compounds and their substituted homologues were investigated on eight stations along <b>Croatia-Italy</b> transect in the Middle Adriatic. PAC concentrations {{were higher in the}} coastal area than in the open sea area. The highest PAC concentrations were measured {{in the vicinity of the}} industrial harbor of Split while the lowest concentrations were observed on stations located in the open sea area. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were dominant group of compounds on each investigated station with contributions in total PAC concentration of more than 85 %. S-PAH concentrations were higher than O-PAH concentration in each sample and tend to decrease as the distance from the coast increased. Contributions of O-PAH in total PAC concentrations were higher in the open sea sediments while S-PAH contributions were higher in the coastal sediment, indicating a different origin of O-PAH. Grain size analysis of the investigated sediments shows the dominance of fine fraction in sediments in the coastal area whereas sandy particles were a dominant fraction in the open sea sediments. TOC concentrations were higher in the open sea area where lower PAH concentrations were observed, indicating a different origin of PAC and TOC. PAH origin was evaluated by application of diagnostic ratios. Pyrogenic origin was determined only on one station whereas dominance of petrogenic PAHs was observed on the most of the stations in the open sea area. Marine traffic was suspected to be the main source of pollution in the open sea area...|$|E
