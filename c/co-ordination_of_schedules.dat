A commercial fishery faces uncertainty mainly from variation in catch rate, which may be due to weather, and other environmental factors. The firm tries to manage this uncertainty through planning <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> fishing trawler <b>scheduling,</b> catch quota, processing and labour allocation, and inventory control. Scheduling must necessarily be done over some finite planning horizon, and the trawler schedule itself introduces man-made variability, which in turn induces inventory in the processing plant. This induced inventory must be managed, complicated by the inability to plan easily beyond the current planning horizon. We develop a surprisingly simple innovation in inventory, which we have not seen in other papers on production management, which of requiring beginning inventory to equal ending inventory. This tool gives management a way to calculate a profit-maximizing safety stock that counter-acts the man-made variability due to the trawler scheduling. We found that the variability of catch rate had virtually no effects on the profitability with inventory. We report numerical results for several planning horizon models, based on data for a major New Zealand fishery...|$|R

5000|$|In Australia, {{the common}} {{building}} contracts in use {{also have a}} [...] "Superintendent". This {{is a person who}} represents the owner or principal and administers the contract terms and conditions. The responsibilities include: assessing and certifying claims for payment, extensions of time and variations to the contract. The Superintendent is also responsible for confirming the builders compliance with the requirements of the building contract and for answering queries in relation to contract matters or other matters related to the construction. The Superintendent in a building contract usually comes from an architectural, quantity surveying or engineering background. As a particular note, in Australia in building projects, the Superintendent is not the party responsible for <b>co-ordination</b> and <b>scheduling</b> <b>of</b> the trades & work of the contract, this {{is the responsibility of the}} head contractor who will usually employ a site manager, overseen by a project manager, overseen by a construction manager / director.|$|R

It concludes that with the Pact for Stability and Growth, the framework for <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> fiscal policies has by and large been completed. As regards <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> structural policies the implementation and review process should be strengthened. The optimal form <b>of</b> policy <b>co-ordination</b> in this field will differ from case to case.

40|$|Recent {{molecular}} dynamics (MD) results for (Na 2 O) (x) (SiO 2) (1 -x) and (CaO) (x) (SiO 2) (1 -x) glasses show that <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> bridging oxygen (O-b) by modifiers (M) {{is a normal}} structural feature. This can be explained {{as a consequence of}} the limitation on oxygen co-ordination in network oxides, a common rule of thumb being that total <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> oxygen by (Si + M) is mv, then there is bonding Of Ob to modifiers, i. e. N-ObM > 0. This is the case in alkali and alkaline earth silicate crystals (apart from Be and Mg), and is predicted to be a feature of glasses in these systems. An illustration of the influence <b>of</b> oxygen <b>co-ordination</b> is given from MD models of (CaO) (0. 33) (SiO 2) (0. 67) glass at pressures of 5 and 10 GPa. The main effect of densification is to increase the <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> Ca by O-b. This can be understood because at 0 GPa the <b>co-ordination</b> <b>Of</b> O b by Ca is already high, with N-OnbCa similar to 2. 7, but the <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> O-b by Ca is less high, with N-ObCa similar to 1, and so can more easily increase...|$|R

40|$|Quality of life {{of nursing}} home {{residents}} is a critical consideration in international health care policies and health care decisions. Yet, there is little relevant research to support decisions about client-tailored and effective nursing care for this population. Because of the permanency of their stay, the care received affects the quality of daily life. This study investigated the quality <b>of</b> <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> care {{and the way it}} is related to gaps between needs and care supply, the quality of life and health status of residents living in Dutch nursing homes. To assess the perceived quality of life and experienced discrepancies between needs and care supply, 337 residents of 10 different nursing homes were interviewed. The quality <b>of</b> <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> nursing care was assessed by judgements of the residents and nurses and by analysing the care documents. The results showed a relation between the <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> care and care discrepancies; the higher the quality <b>of</b> <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> care, the fewer the gaps between residents' needs and the care they received. The psycho-social aspects in particular showed a gap between the needs and care supply. As regards the relation between <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> care and quality of life, the strongest positive relations were found between taking case histories, patient allocation and dimensions of quality of life. No direct relations were found between the <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> care and care discrepancies {{on the one hand and}} the health status of the residents on the other. In conclusion, this study showed that the quality <b>of</b> <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> care can affect the perceived quality {{of life of}} nursing home residents. To meet the residents' needs it is important to assess their physical and psycho-social needs accurately. More research focusing on this assessment is needed in order to improve the quality of life of nursing home residents. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
