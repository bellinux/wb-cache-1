50|$|<b>Cyclopentamine</b> {{acts as a}} {{releasing}} agent of the catecholamine neurotransmitters norepinephrine (noradrenaline), epinephrine (adrenaline), and dopamine. Its effects on norepinephrine and epinephrine mediate its decongestant effects, while its effects on all three neurotransmitters are responsible for its stimulant properties. When ingested orally in sufficient quantities, <b>cyclopentamine</b> produces similar effects to amphetamine, methamphetamine, and propylhexedrine.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cyclopentamine</b> (trade names Clopane, Cyclonarol, Cyclosal, Cyklosan, Nazett, Sinos, among others) is a {{sympathomimetic}} alkylamine, {{classified as}} a vasoconstrictor. <b>Cyclopentamine</b> was indicated {{in the past as}} an over-the-counter (OTC) medication for use as a nasal decongestant, notably in Europe and Australia, but has now been largely discontinued possibly due to the availability, effectiveness, and safety of a structurally similar drug, propylhexedrine.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} the acyclic part of the molecule, both <b>cyclopentamine</b> and {{propylhexedrine}} {{are the same as}} methamphetamine, all three molecules containing the 2-methylaminopropyl side-chain. The difference between them is that whereas methamphetamine is an aromatic molecule containing a phenyl group, <b>cyclopentamine</b> and propylhexedrine are entirely aliphatic and contain no delocalized electrons at all. The effect that this has on potency is that the reduced alicyclic-alkylamines are weaker than unsaturated (meth)amphetamine.|$|E
50|$|Cycloalkylamines are {{chemical}} compounds featuring a cycloalkyl group and an amine. Some examples include propylhexedrine, <b>cyclopentamine,</b> cypenamine, and tranylcypromine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyclopentamine</b> is the {{cyclopentane}} homolog of propylhexedrine, differing only {{in terms}} of the contracted ring size of a cyclopentane, containing one —CH2— unit less than the cyclohexyl group.|$|E
40|$|IN RECENT YEARS, {{numerous}} publica-tions {{have appeared}} emphasizing the use-fulness of mephentermine during {{various forms of}} anesthesia {{as a means of}} maintaining an adequate blood-pressure level. 1 " 3 Lundy 4 has employed mephentermine successfully as an effective antidote against narcotic drugs. Pharmacological studies of sympathomimetic drugs on pulmonary circulation have shown mephentermine to be a pulmonary vasodila-tor. 5 The object {{of the present study was}} to in-vestigate the respiratory effects of mephenter-mine systematically, and to test in humans the cardiovascular actions of this drug on the pul-monary circulation, in view of the scant infor-mation existing at present on these actions in man. Methods The present study comprised two groups of patients. Chronic Pulmonary Disease Group This group included 14 patients, 12 of whom were suffering from chronic pulmonary emphy-sema with varying degrees of fihrosis. The re-maining two patients had asthma. Complete spiro-metrical studies were performed in 11 of these patients, both in the semireeumbent and sitting-up positions, at rest, and were repeated after intra-muscular administration of 23 mg. of mephenter-mine (total). Average body surface in this group was 1. 63 M. 2. Immediately after these studies were completed, an aerosol with a known bronehodilator (<b>cyclopentamine)</b> was given and the maximum breathing capacity was determined when its bronehodilator effects were considered to be maximal. A Collins 9 -L. respirometer without valves was used for these studies...|$|E
