5|$|A map of Kintzheim in Alsace from 1348 {{contains}} the text zu dem Russelinge, {{but it is}} not <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> reference is to the grape variety. However, in 1477, Riesling was documented in Alsace under the spelling Rissling. In Wachau in Austria, there is a small stream and a small vineyard both called Ritzling, which are claimed locally to have given Riesling its name. However, {{there seems to be no}} documentary evidence to back this up, so this claim is not widely believed to be correct.|$|E
5|$|According to {{contemporary}} accounts in the Annales Piacentines the College of Cardinals {{was divided into}} adherents of Charles d'Anjou (pars Caroli) and the Imperial party (pars Imperii), but the exact reconstruction of these parties is very difficult. It is almost <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> account is inaccurate when it claims that pars Caroli had six (or seven, in another place in that account) members, including Giovanni Gaetano Orsini and Ottobono Fieschi, while pars Imperii had eleven (or ten) members, Riccardo Annibaldi, Ottaviano Ubaldini and Uberto Coconati among them. Certainly five cardinals, namely Ottobono Fieschi, Guillame de Bray, Anchero Pantaleone, Simon Monpitie de Brie and Odo of Châteauroux belonged to the Angevin faction. But if Giovanni Gaetano Orsini was really one of their leaders, then his relatives Matteo Orsini Rosso and Giacomo Savelli should also be added here, and since Henry of Segusio {{is also likely to}} have belonged to this faction, its true size would have amounted to nine cardinals. Imperial party, on the contrary, could not have had more than ten members, including two who had died during sede vacante.|$|E

25|$|Leosthenes (Greek: Λεωσθένης; died 323 BC) was an Athenian who was {{commander}} of the combined Greek army in the Lamian War. Leosthenes is usually identified {{as the son of}} that Leosthenes who had suffered exile in 362/1 BC and who had fled to the court of Philip II. It is unknown by what means he had obtained the high reputation he had when he first makes his appearance in history. It has been generally inferred, from a passage in Strabo, that he had first served under Alexander the Great in Asia; but it now seems <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is a mistake, and rather the reference should have been to Leonnatus.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} long after Every's disappearance, another flag was {{ascribed}} to him: a white skull in profile wearing a kerchief and an earring, above a saltire of two white crossed bones, {{on a black}} field. The original source in which this flag first appears is not known, {{but it does not}} appear in publications until the 1920s or early 1930s. If the flag is genuine, it contradicts the generally accepted belief that French pirate Emanuel Wynn was the first to use the skull and crossbones motif, in 1700. Furthermore, earrings and bandanas were generally not associated with pirates until the artwork of Howard Pyle in the 1880s, so it is almost <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> flag is a 20th-century invention.|$|E
25|$|Wansdyke {{consists}} of two sections, 14 and 19kilometres (9 and 12mi) long with some gaps in between. East Wansdyke is an impressive linear earthwork, consisting of a ditch and bank running approximately east-west, between Savernake Forest and Morgan's Hill. West Wansdyke is also a linear earthwork, running from Monkton Combe south of Bath to Maes Knoll south of Bristol, but less impressive than its eastern counterpart. The middle section, 22kilometres (14mi) long, is {{sometimes referred to as}} 'Mid Wansdyke', but is formed by the remains of the London to Bath Roman road. It used to be thought that these sections were all part of one continuous undertaking, especially during the Middle Ages when the pagan name Wansdyke was applied to all three parts. However, it is not now considered <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is so.|$|E

25|$|The {{first and}} chief article is this: Jesus Christ, our God and Lord, died for our sins and was raised again for our {{justification}} (Romans 3:24–25). He alone is the Lamb of God who takes away {{the sins of}} the world (John 1:29), and God has laid on Him the iniquity of us all (Isaiah 53:6). All have sinned and are justified freely, without their own works and merits, by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, in His blood (Romans 3:23–25). This is necessary to believe. This cannot be otherwise acquired or grasped by any work, law or merit. Therefore, it is clear and <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> faith alone justifies us...

25|$|In 1682 he was, at {{more than}} sixty years of age, {{recognized}} as one of the foremost men of letters of France. Madame de Sévigné, one of the soundest literary critics of the time, and by no means given to praise mere novelties, had spoken of his second collection of Fables published in the winter of 1678 as divine; and it is pretty <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the general opinion. It was not unreasonable, therefore, that he should present himself to the Académie française, and, though the subjects of his Contes were scarcely calculated to propitiate that decorous assembly, while his attachment to Fouquet and to more than one representative of the old Frondeur party made him suspect to Colbert and the king, most of the members were his personal friends.|$|E

On several occasions Straw reiterated his position that the decision to invade was in his opinion the right thing to do, but said he did not 'know' for <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the case. He said he understood why public opinion on several matters might differ from his own—a Newsnight/ICM poll showed over 70% of respondents believed the war in Iraq to have increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks in Britain, but Straw said he could not agree based on the information presented to him.|$|E

25|$|The 1856 'Name Book' of the OS {{states that}} part of the house of Chapelton (NS 395 441) is {{believed}} to have been a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Though parts of the building are of great age, it is not <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the chapel; it may have been the residence of the chaplain, while the chapel stood near Chapel Hill. This Chapel Hill is a circular artificial hill. About 1850, Mr. J McAlister raised it to its present height by taking the earth etc. that had slid from its sides, and putting it on the top. While doing this, a quantity of human bones was found near the base on the S and E sides, and also some stones which from their appearance Mr. McAlister thought had been exposed to fire, suggesting that the old chapel was destroyed by fire. Mr. R Miller, a former proprietor, stated that when the present road past Chapel Hill was being made, a quantity of bones was found, giving the idea that there had been a burial ground here.|$|E

No prior missions had attempted such a flyby. Galileo was launched into orbit by the Space Shuttle Atlantis mission STS-34 on 18 October 1989. Changing Galileo's trajectory to approach Ida required that it consume [...] of propellant. Mission planners delayed the decision to attempt a flyby until they were <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would leave the spacecraft enough propellant to complete its Jupiter mission.|$|E
500|$|At the Coroner's Inquest {{into the}} death of the Princess, on 13 February 2008, {{speaking}} by video-link from France, Tomlinson conceded that, after the interval of 16 or 17 years, he [...] "could not remember specifically" [...] whether the document he had seen during 1992 had in fact proposed the use of a strobe light to cause a traffic accident as a means of assassinating Milošević, although use of lights for this purpose had been covered in his MI6 training. On being told that no MI6 file on Henri Paul had been found, Tomlinson said that it [...] "would be absurd after 17 years to say I can positively disagree with it, but... I do not think the fact that they did not manage to find a file rules out anything either". He said he believed MI6 had an informant at the Paris Ritz but he could not be <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> person was necessarily Henri Paul.|$|E

[...] James Axtell, who edited the most comprehensive edition of Locke's educational writings, has explained that although [...] "he was writing for this small class, this does not preclude the possibility that many of the things he said about education, especially its main principles, were equally applicable to all children" [...] (Axtell's emphasis). This was a contemporary view as well; Pierre Coste, in his introduction in the first French edition in 1695, wrote, [...] "it is <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> Work was particularly designed for the education of Gentlemen: but this does not prevent its serving also for the education of all sorts of Children, of whatever class they are." ...|$|E
500|$|Bret buys a new cup for $2.79 {{so that he}} and Jemaine {{no longer}} have to share one cup. A month later, they find out that their check for the phone bill bounced because their account was short $2.79.

Immediately after finding this out, their power goes off. Bret ends up selling his guitar to pay the bills, and he performs on stage with Jemaine while playing air guitar and making guitar sounds. Murray writes up his negative opinion of the show in the New Zealand consulate newsletter, giving them [...] "two stars out of 100". When Bret asks Murray for some of the emergency band fund, Murray tells him that he invested the money with a Nigerian man named Nigel Seladu who contacted him over the internet.

Jemaine and Bret are <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is merely a scam.|$|E
500|$|To {{what extent}} Mint Assistant Engraver (later Chief Engraver) George T. Morgan should be {{credited}} {{for work on}} the half dollar and quarter eagle is uncertain; Mint officials and employees were not consistent on this point. [...] Assistant Director Mary M. O'Reilly said in 1936 that the bureau's records indicated that Barber was the designer. [...] Later the same year, she forwarded a statement by an unnamed Philadelphia Mint employee stating that by {{the very nature of}} Barber's and Morgan's long association (Morgan was Barber's assistant for 37 years), the two engravers would have conferred frequently, and that Morgan's technique is [...] "very obvious on both sides of both coins". The employee concluded that [...] "no mistake could be made, in my opinion, in crediting both men with the execution of these two coins. [...] I am <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is correct." [...] Q. David Bowers, in his book on commemoratives, mentions the dispute, credits Barber on the obverses of both coins, and gives both men credit on the reverse of the half dollar.

500|$|Much of Einarr's {{story in}} the sagas appears {{to be derived from}} the five skaldic verses {{attributed}} to Einarr himself and it is not <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> account Einarr's conquest is historically accurate. Though the Historia Norvegiæ, written {{at the same time as}} the sagas but from a different source, confirms that Rognvald's family conquered the islands, it gives few details. The scene in the sagas where Einarr's father scorns him is a literary device which often figures in Old Norse literature. After Hallad's failure in [...] Orkney the dialogue between the father and his sons has been interpreted as being about Rognvald's desire to cement his own position as Earl of Møre and an allusion to the early history of Iceland, where the sagas were written. Thorir is [...] a compliant son who Rognvald is happy to keep at home. Hrolluag is portrayed as a man of peace who will go to Iceland. [...] Einarr is aggressive and a threat to his father's position so can be spared for the dangers of Orkney. In the Landnámabók version the equally aggressive Hrolfr is also present, and his destiny is anticipated to be in conveniently far-away Normandy.|$|E
500|$|However, {{whether this}} {{regionalisation}} of the legions was partnered by {{a drop in}} the professionalism of the troops is contested. Antonio Santosuosso argues that the strict discipline and high motivation of the days of Marius had lapsed, but Andrew Alfoldi states that the Illyrian troops were both valiant and warlike, and Tacitus described German recruits as being natural mercenaries (Latin: vivi ad arma nati). It seems that discipline in the legions did slacken, with soldiers granted permission to live with wives outside of military lodgings and permitted to adopt a more lavish and comfortable lifestyle, in contrast to the strict military regimen of earlier years. However, {{it is by no means}} <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> led to any reduction in the effectiveness of the legions, due to the greater ferocity and stature of the barbari recruits. [...] The flavour of the Roman military, however, was now dictated by the increasing number of regional recruits, leading to a partial barbarisation of Rome's military forces beginning in this period. The barbarisation of the lower ranks was paralleled by a concurrent barbarisation of its command structure, with the Roman senators who had traditionally provided its commanders becoming entirely excluded from the army. By 235AD the Emperor himself, the figurehead of the entire military, was a man born outside of Italy to non-Italian parents.|$|E

It was the hardest crack climb in Colorado at the time and there were only one or two harder ones in Yosemite. Long was amazed by her feat. He has said [...] "that's when I knew for <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> woman had extraordinary talent". The regional guidebook credits Long with the first free ascent of the route; Hill speculates {{the reason for this is}} that at the time she was an unknown climber and known only as Long's partner and protege. In her autobiography, Hill explains that it was during this climb that she realized it is not a person's size or strength but ability to be creative on the rock that is important: [...] "The big lesson for me... was to realize that despite what appeared to be a limitation due to my small stature, I could create my own method of getting past a difficult section of rock. John's size and power enabled him to make long reaches and explosive lunge moves that were completely out of my range. I, on the other hand, often found small intermediate holds that John couldn't even imagine gripping... Short or tall, man or woman, the rock is an objective medium that is equally open for interpretation by all." ...|$|E
