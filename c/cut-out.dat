5|$|During {{the early}} 19th century, the {{collection}} of 15th- and 16th-century Netherlandish <b>cut-out,</b> as miniatures or parts for albums, became fashionable amongst connoisseurs such as William Young Ottley, leading {{to the destruction of}} many manuscripts. Originals were highly sought after, a revival that helped the rediscovery of Netherlandish art in the later part of the century.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by the FBI's presence, Zero visits Oswald at {{his home}} that night; a drunk and rowdy Oswald dismisses Zero's worries and summons {{lightning}} to strike down nearby cattle. The lightning strikes him instead, but he appears unharmed. The next day, the agents visit the scene and find a melted shoe print in the ground, linking it to Oswald. Meanwhile, Oswald uses his abilities to manipulate local traffic lights, causing a car accident. The agents visit Oswald's home and find a <b>cut-out</b> picture of Sharon Kiveat, Oswald's former high school teacher, inside a porn magazine.|$|E
40|$|Every {{aircraft}} fuselage has <b>cut-outs</b> due to many reasons. Some {{of those}} <b>cut-outs</b> feature non-load-carrying covers respectively doors. In those cases the surrounding structure carries the load. This circumstance leads to structural reinforcements around the <b>cut-outs</b> {{which in turn}} lead to a stiffness (re-) distribution which {{must be taken into}} account for proper structural analysis. This report refers to the modeling and analysis tools on the preliminary aircraft design team of DLR-BT. The definition of <b>cut-outs</b> in CPACS is explained and how the generation of the <b>cut-outs</b> was implemented in the modeling tools FDESIGN and ROFUMA. Examples of both, definition and generation of <b>cut-outs</b> are shown and current limitations of the methodologies are mentioned...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Orthotropic decks are {{commonly}} used in high-speed railway bridges. Finite-element model is established by ANSYS for orthotropic steel bridge deck in this paper. Taking the standard PDL ZK live load as the train load, the local stress of the rib-to-deck joint, the rib-to-crossbeam joint, and the <b>cut-outs</b> of the crossbeam are analyzed respectively. Analysis {{results show that the}} stress concentration of bridge deck mainly appears at the intersecting part of the U-shaped rib, crossbeam, and bridge deck. In the whole bridge deck, the local stress level of the <b>cut-outs</b> in crossbeam is almost the highest, and the <b>cut-outs</b> is distorted seriously; the maximum stress of crossbeam <b>cut-outs</b> is mainly concentrated at the lower arc of the <b>cut-outs,</b> {{which is one of the}} positions prone to fatigue failure...|$|R
5000|$|In Great Britain {{the postal}} use of <b>cut-outs</b> was banned under the Post Office Act of 1870. This {{prohibition}} was in force until 31 December 1904. In 1905, Herbert L'Estrange Ewen published a booklet [...] "The Unadhesive Postage Stamps of the UK" [...] meaning postal stationery <b>cut-outs.</b>|$|R
5|$|Roy of the Rovers Annuals were {{produced}} {{every year from}} 1958 until 1994, and again in 2000. A number of tie-in books were also published, including a handful of paperback prose storybooks in 1977 and 1993, and two football quiz books in 1978 and 1979. Roy of the Rovers never made the leap from page to screen, although he did make an appearance on the BBC comedy sports quiz They Think It's All Over in 1999, {{in the form of}} a cardboard <b>cut-out.</b> on 10 October 2006.|$|E
5|$|By July Bellerophon {{was part}} of a {{squadron}} commanded by Captain Thomas Byam Martin of HMS Implacable. They were off Percola Point on 7 July when a flotilla of eight Russian gunboats was sighted. A boat party led by Lieutenant Hawkey of Implacable made an attempt to <b>cut-out</b> the vessels that evening. Hawkey was killed in the attempt, but Bellerophons Lieutenant Charles Allen took over command, and six of the gunboats were captured, and a seventh destroyed, with 12 craft containing stores for the Russian Army also being taken. Bellerophon made several cruises {{during the rest of the}} year, visiting the Åland Islands and Karlskrona, before returning to Britain with a convoy in November 1809.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing and leaning {{on a table}} in an almost Napoleonic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus seems to be on his groin rather than his face. It is obvious that Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier <b>cut-out</b> version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.|$|E

5|$|The film {{included}} several technical errors. <b>Cut-out</b> cardboard pieces {{were used to}} depict military aircraft during battle scenes in the film, and one film critic said viewers were almost {{able to identify the}} threads attached to the cardboard cut-outs. Footage of a digital watch was spliced into the film, though this technology would not be invented for twenty-five years after the film's time period. There were other problems. Jacqueline Bisset developed laryngitis during the film's production. A set-piece for the film included a re-created version of a lighthouse at Incheon, but this was obliterated by a typhoon. The death of David Janssen during production called for extensive reshoots.|$|E
5|$|The show's {{style of}} {{animation}} {{is inspired by}} the paper <b>cut-out</b> cartoons made by Terry Gilliam for Monty Python's Flying Circus, of which Parker and Stone have been lifelong fans. Construction paper and traditional stop motion cutout animation techniques {{were used in the}} original animated shorts and in the pilot episode. Subsequent episodes have been produced by computer animation, providing a similar look to the originals while requiring a fraction of the time to produce. Before computer artists begin animating an episode, a series of animatics drawn in Toon Boom are provided by the show's storyboard artists.|$|E
5|$|Emerald and Seahorse chased Anemone inshore, {{where she}} {{anchored}} {{in shallow water}} out of their reach. When they launched their boats to <b>cut-out</b> Anėmone, her crew cut the anchor cable and their ship drifted on to the shore; as the Frenchmen were attempting to escape along the coast, hostile Arabs captured them and stripped them of their clothes, shooting those who resisted. A heavy surf prevented the British boats from landing, so a midshipman from Emerald, the young Francis Fane, swam ashore with a line and empty cask to rescue the commander and seven others who had escaped naked to the beach. Anėmone had a crew of 60 men {{under the command of}} Enseigne de Vaisseau (Ensign) Garibou, and was also carrying General Camin and Citoyen Valette, Aide-de-Camp to General Napoleon Bonaparte, with dispatches from Toulon. Camin and Valette were among those the Arabs killed. Emerald remained stationed off Alexandria {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{theoretical}} {{analysis of the}} curvature effects on the stress distribution around circular <b>cut-outs</b> in monolithic isotropic cylinders is extended to a theory for the calculation of the stress distribution in sandwich cylinders with <b>cut-outs.</b> The stresses in the facings of a sandwich cylinder are determined for two loading cases, namely a uniformly distributed axial load and internal pressurization. The effect of core height variation on these stresses will be examined. It appears {{that the effect of}} the intrinsic bending stiffness on the stress distribution around circular <b>cut-outs</b> in sandwich shells is determined by the sandwich curvature parameter.

25|$|In 1948, Matisse {{began to}} prepare {{designs for the}} Chapelle du Rosaire de Vence, which allowed him to expand this {{technique}} within a truly decorative context. The experience of designing the chapel windows, chasubles, and tabernacle door—all planned using the <b>cut-out</b> method—had the effect of consolidating the medium as his primary focus. Finishing his last painting in 1951 (and final sculpture the year before), Matisse utilized the paper <b>cut-out</b> as his sole medium for expression up until his death.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the paper}} <b>cut-out</b> was Matisse’s major medium {{in the final}} decade of his life, his first {{recorded}} use of the technique was in 1919 during the design of decor for the Le chant du rossignol, an opera made by Igor Stravinsky. Albert C. Barnes arranged for cardboard templates {{to be made of}} the unusual dimensions of the walls onto which Matisse, in his studio in Nice, fixed the composition of painted paper shapes. Another group of cut-outs were made between 1937 and 1938, while Matisse was working on the stage sets and costumes for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. However, it was only after his operation that, bedridden, Matisse began to develop the <b>cut-out</b> technique as its own form, rather than its prior utilitarian origin.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} {{independently}} conceived <b>cut-outs</b> steadily increased following Jazz, and {{eventually led to}} the creation of mural-size works, such as Oceania the Sky and Oceania the Sea of 1946. Under Matisse’s direction, Lydia Delectorskaya, his studio assistant, loosely pinned the silhouettes of birds, fish, and marine vegetation directly onto the walls of the room. The two Oceania pieces, his first <b>cut-outs</b> of this scale, evoked a trip to Tahiti he made years before.|$|R
