5|$|The thick {{shell and}} rounded shape of {{bivalves}} make them awkward for potential predators to tackle. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} different creatures include them in their diet. Many species of demersal fish feed on them including the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), which is being used in the upper Mississippi River to try to control the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). Birds such as the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) have specially adapted beaks which can pry open their shells. The herring gull (Larus argentatus) sometimes drops heavy shells onto rocks in order to crack them open. Sea otters feed on a variety of bivalve species and have been observed to use stones balanced on their chests as anvils on which to <b>crack</b> <b>open</b> the shells. The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) {{is one of the main}} predators feeding on bivalves in Arctic waters. Shellfish have formed part of the human diet since prehistoric times, a fact evidenced by the remains of mollusc shells found in ancient middens. Examinations of these deposits in Peru has provided a means of dating long past El Niño events because of the disruption these caused to bivalve shell growth.|$|E

The Seabees used backhoes to <b>crack</b> <b>open</b> the still-burning plane to rescue survivors and erected mortuary tents for first responders. There was confusion over the administration of the effort; the crash occurred on land owned by the United States Navy but civil authorities initially claimed authority. The hull had disintegrated, and jet fuel in the wing tanks had sparked a fire which was still burning eight hours after impact.|$|E

An enraged Hulk {{was able to}} <b>crack</b> <b>open</b> Onslaught's shell. However, Onslaught {{remained}} as pure psionic energy, separated Hulk and Banner, planning to spread across the planet. Thor Odinson plunged into Onslaught, trying to contain him. The Fantastic Four, {{the majority of the}} Avengers, and the Hulk-less Banner followed in short order, with Doom being forced to join the sacrifice when Iron Man tackled the villain into the energy mass. Thanks to this sacrifice, the X-Men finally managed to destroy Onslaught. Doom, the Fantastic Four, and the Avengers and Banner were believed dead but were instead saved by Franklin, who created a pocket dimension called Counter-Earth to keep them safe. After several months away, the missing heroes returned from Counter-Earth, except for Doom, who remained there for a time. Doom uncovers the secret power {{at the heart of the}} planet, an avatar of his arch-foe Reed Richards' son, Franklin, the super-powered youth who conjured this globe and left a bit of himself behind to guide it from within. Doom managed to convince the little boy to relinquish control of this world with little more than a few errant promises of a better life.|$|E
500|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} and Baudin's black cockatoo {{were once}} known collectively as the white-tailed black cockatoo (C. [...] baudinii) until formally classified as separate species. In a 1933 {{report on the}} birds of Lake Grace, Western Australian naturalist Ivan Carnaby wrote of a distinctive population of white-tailed black cockatoos that he named mallee black cockatoos. These birds lived in mallee and sandplains, using their large bills to <b>crack</b> <b>open</b> woody seed pods; the typical form had a long narrow bill it used to extract eucalyptus seeds from red gum seed pods. He classified it as a subspecies of the white-tailed black cockatoo in 1948, giving it the name Calyptorhynchus baudinii latirostris. The epithet latirostris is from the Latin latus [...] "wide" [...] and rostrum [...] "bill". The holotype specimen is from Hopetoun, Western Australia.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a continuum inelasticity-damage-based model. The aim is to describe the behavior of plain and reinforced concrete under monotonic and cyclic loading. We consider that inelasticity is due to micro-crack openings, and that the material recovers its original elastic modulus when all micro-cracks are closed. We make the hypothesis that the displacement ﬁeld, due to micro-crack openings, remains consis- tent with a strain called Unitary <b>Crack</b> <b>Opening.</b> The damage is described by a simple scalar which is taken as a multiplier of the Unitary <b>Crack</b> <b>Opening</b> tensor. Hence, the crack closure effects are directly described, the material recovers its original elasticity when micro- cracks are closed. Damage variable multiplied by the Unitary <b>Crack</b> <b>Opening</b> tensor gives a good description of anisotropy. Nonlinearity occurs when both damage and Unitary <b>Crack</b> <b>Opening</b> strains exist. Firstly, the thermodynamic and mathematical basis of the model are explored. Elementary tests are ﬁrstly considered for validation. Furthermore, the single edge notched beam and a beam subjected to cyclic loading are tested...|$|R

500|$|The {{skull of}} the spotted hyena {{differs from that}} of the striped hyena by its much greater size and {{narrower}} sagittal crest. For its size, the spotted hyena {{has one of the most}} powerfully built skulls among the Carnivora. The dentition is more dual purposed than that of other modern hyena species, which are mostly scavengers; the upper and lower third premolars are conical bone-crushers, with a third bone-holding cone jutting from the lower fourth premolar. The spotted hyena also has its carnassials situated behind its bone-crushing premolars, the position of which allows it to crush bone with its premolars without blunting the carnassials. Combined with large jaw muscles and a special vaulting to protect the skull against large forces, these characteristics give the spotted hyena a powerful bite which can exert a pressure of 80kgf/cm2 (1140 lbf/in²), which is 40% more force than a leopard can generate. The jaws of the spotted hyena outmatch those of the brown bear in bonecrushing ability, and free ranging hyenas have been observed to <b>crack</b> <b>open</b> the long bones of giraffes measuring 7cm in diameter. A [...] spotted hyena is estimated to have a bite force of 565.7 newtons at the canine tip and 985.5 newtons at the carnassial eocone. One individual in a study was found to exert a bite force of 4,500 newtons on the measuring instruments.|$|E

2500|$|There are few {{reports of}} gorillas using {{tools in the}} wild. Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) have been {{observed}} using sticks to apparently measure the depth of water and as [...] "walking sticks" [...] to support their posture when crossing deeper water. An adult female used a detached trunk from a small shrub as a stabilizer during food gathering, and another used a log as a bridge. One {{possible explanation for the}} absence of observed tool use in wild gorillas is that they are less dependent on foraging techniques that require the use of tools, since they exploit food resources differently from chimpanzees. Whereas chimpanzees and orangutans feeding involves tools such as hammers to <b>crack</b> <b>open</b> nuts and sticks to fish for termites, gorillas access these foods by breaking nuts with their teeth and smashing termite mounds with their hands.|$|E
2500|$|Oystercatcher mussel feeding {{provides}} an example of how the optimal diet model can be utilized. [...] Oystercatchers forage on mussels and crack them open with their bills. The constraints on these birds are the characteristics of the different mussel sizes. While large mussels provide more energy than small mussels, large mussels are harder to <b>crack</b> <b>open</b> due to their thicker shells. This means that while large mussels have a higher energy content (E), they also have a longer handling time (h). The profitability of any mussel is calculated as E/h. [...] The oystercatchers must decide which mussel size will provide enough nutrition to outweigh the cost and energy required to open it. In their study, Meire and Ervynck tried to model this decision by graphing the relative profitabilities of different sized mussels. They came up with a bell-shaped curve, indicating that moderately sized mussels were the most profitable. However, they observed that if an oystercatcher rejected too many small mussels, the time it took to search for the next suitable mussel greatly increased. This observation shifted their bell-curve to the right (Figure 4). [...] However, while this model predicted that oystercatchers should prefer mussels of 50–55mm, the observed data showed that oystercatchers actually prefer mussels of 30–45mm. Meire and Ervynk then realized the preference of mussel size did not only depend on the profitability of the prey, but also on the prey density. After this was accounted for, they found a good agreement between the model's prediction and the observed data.|$|E
