The floor slabs prevent {{the necessity of}} corner columns thus allowing the building to be fitted with large corner windows. The three ornate entrances face Central Park West, 62nd, and 63rd Streets. During the 1980s the building held 410 apartments, {{ranging in size from}} one to eight bedrooms; 52 of the apartments had large terraces. The main lobby, on the ground floor, houses professional offices.|$|E
50|$|George Poland House is a {{historic}} home located near Bahama, Durham County, North Carolina. It was designed by noted architect George Matsumoto and built in 1956 in the International Style. It was originally located at 3929 Arrow Drive in Raleigh, North Carolina and moved to its present location in 2001. It is a rectangular, one-story, flat-roofed dwelling on a full basement. The house features <b>cantilevered</b> <b>floor</b> and ceiling beams, a front entry platform, a full-facade covered rear porch, and an open elevated wraparound walkway.|$|E
5000|$|In total, {{there are}} 47 levels above ground, of which 42 are cantilevered. The lowest <b>cantilevered</b> <b>floor</b> is {{designated}} Level 1, but {{is in fact}} the fourth level above ground. The cantilevered floors are designed as three segments, or leaves, which approximately correspond to the three chevrons of the NatWest logo when viewed in plan. The two lowest cantilevered levels (1 and 2) are formed of a single [...] "leaf"; and the next two (3 and 4) are formed of two leaves. This pattern is repeated at the top, so that only levels 5 to 38 extend around the whole of the building.|$|E

5000|$|The {{layout of}} the Butterfly house set a new {{standard}} for holiday houses in Australia. A stone plinth holds the main living and private spaces to emphasize {{the view of the}} bay. [...] The Children Bedroom and laundry are located on the ground floor, allowing the main active spaces such as the lounge room to have priority access to the views. The connection to the exterior was strengthened through the open plan living, removing the strict separation of the traditional dining area, lounge and exterior lounge. This provides a more relaxed and free flowing movement within the house, complimenting the associated lifestyle of beach-side living. Due to the increased availability of family cars, a sheltered parking space is included underneath the <b>cantilevered</b> <b>floor</b> resulting in ease of access for residents.|$|E
5000|$|The {{simple and}} {{innovative}} design {{was based on}} principles of twisting square-shaped floor plates with vertical structural RC frame supported by a central core and  8 columns in the octagon arrangement with continuous beams and 4 spiraling columns at the corners. The proposed structural scheme with cantilevered continuous RC beams and <b>cantilevered</b> <b>floor</b> slabs, picking up the overhangs from the twisted floor plates, appeared to be simple, efficient and economical, so after the first presentations and publications since 2006 this structural scheme was immediately copied by few twisting towers that are now under construction, though some other twisters have much more complex structures including the famous truss-supported Turning Torso tower in Malmo, Sweden, that was a first of that kind. In Evolution Tower case the simplicity of a fully RC tower structure with no outrigger levels {{saved a lot of}} time and money for the construction budget. However, with the floor slab layout changing 52 times (52 floors twisting by 3 degrees each level) pouring the concrete presented a certain logistical challenge. Nevertheless the solution was found: the innovative formwork system by PERI provided that core walls and floor slabs are concreted in one pour with each floor divided into three sections. Four hydraulic self-climbing (ACS) units have been used to make large working platforms, where the top three floors under construction are tightly enclosed with a rail-climbing protection panel also providing the wind protection and formwork for the 4 twisting corner columns. The units climb the constant twist of the building in an inclined position, propelled by hydraulics, where the installed rail-guided system (with inclined rails connected to the building frame by slab shoes) ensured a fast and safe climb in inclined positions. Landing platforms climb on rails hydraulically with the help of mobile climbing devices (without a crane). On the sides of the building, rail-climbing landing platforms (RCS) provide temporary storage areas and move loads. This bespoke self-climbing formwork system allowed to achieve the impressive maximum speed of RC frame construction of 6 days per floor with 7 days per floor as an average speed.|$|E

This field investigation {{was designed to}} compare three insulation strategies commonly used in residential cantilevered floors. The first objective is to determine floor surface temperatures above insulated cantilever cavities, with respect to occupant thermal comfort. The second objective is to determine moisture behavior within insulated cantilever cavities, with respect to durability. The experimental set-up was installed in the <b>cantilevered</b> <b>floor</b> of an existing Minnesota home. The {{first six months of}} investigation, from mid-summer into early winter, provided data for analysis and discussion presented in this thesis. Investigation results support the view that <b>cantilevered</b> <b>floor</b> cavities open to adjacent conditioned space have warmer floor surfaces above them. Condensation and wetting in some cantilever cavities during colder weather suggests that durability risks are increased in cavities where there is air movement through the thermal insulation. Further investigation is expected to provide a more comprehensive representation of the annual hygrothermal cycle...|$|E

25|$|For the <b>cantilevered</b> <b>floors,</b> Wright and {{his team}} used {{upside-down}} T-shaped beams integrated into a monolithic concrete slab which formed both {{the ceiling of the}} space below and provided resistance against compression. The contractor, Walter Hall, also an engineer, produced independent computations and argued for increasing the reinforcing steel in the first floor’s slab. Wright refused the suggestion. While some sources state that the contractor quietly doubled the amount of reinforcement, others say that Kaufman's consulting engineers – at Kaufman's request – redrew Wright's reinforcing drawings and doubled the amount of steel specified by Wright.|$|R

25|$|The Central Library {{consisted}} of two elements: the extrovert lending library and the introvert reference library. The lending library was designed for heavy use and short visits. It formed a wing to the reference library and was of three storeys with a curved façade facing the Town Hall. The reference library was an eight-storey square block designed around an open atrium above a public square {{that was designed to}} be entered from four sides. Above the square floated the <b>cantilevered</b> <b>floors</b> of the library in a distinctive inverted ziggurat formation. The designers drew inspiration for the design from Antonio Sant'Elia's drawings of Casa a gradinata, and Marcel Breuer's 1928 scheme for a hospital at Elberfeld, Indiana; while another source of inspiration was Leslie Martin's Bodleian Law Library in Oxford. It has also been suggested that they were influenced by the similar design for Boston City Hall, but a member of Madin’s design team said they had only seen this design after the library was complete.|$|R
50|$|Directly south across 58th Street from Robie House is the Charles M. Harper Center of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Designed by the Uruguayan-born {{architect}} Rafael Viñoly {{and completed}} in 2004, the building both respects {{the scale of}} the Robie House and contains elements that echo Wright's contributions to the vocabulary of modern architecture. “The massing was considered with that of the surrounding buildings of the campus and the neighborhood,” Viñoly said. More specifically, Viñoly selected the linear limestone and <b>cantilevered</b> <b>floors</b> with the Robie House in mind. In addition, built-in planters edge the second floor balconies and surround the entranceway terrace, echoing those found on the Robie House balconies and porches. The entranceway terrace itself provides visitors with a panoramic view of the south elevation of the Robie House. Viñoly acknowledged that these elements of his design were intended to pay homage to Wright and his architectural vision.|$|R

50|$|Slim and Romero {{discussed}} {{the design of}} the building extensively, even going over details of the planned construction during family gatherings. Before being selected as project architect Romero had won several international architecture awards. Each of the six floors of the museum are distinctly shaped. The weight of the building is held by an exoskeleton of 28 vertical curved steel columns and seven beams encircling the structure built by a Slim-owned company that manufactures offshore oil rigs. In addition, the roof is kept stable through its suspension from a <b>cantilever.</b> The <b>floors</b> are made of high quality marble that was imported from Greece.|$|R

25|$|At a {{time when}} monumentality {{was seen as an}} {{appropriate}} attribute for governmental architecture, the architects sought to create a bold statement of modern civic democracy, placed within the historic city of Boston. While the architects looked to precedents by Le Corbusier, especially the monastery of Sainte Marie de La Tourette, with its <b>cantilevered</b> upper <b>floors,</b> exposed concrete structure, and its similar interpretation of public and private spaces, they also drew from the example of Medieval and Renaissance Italian town halls and public spaces, {{as well as from the}} bold granite structures of 19th-century Boston (including Alexander Parris' Quincy Market immediately to the east).|$|R
50|$|The facade is five bays {{wide and}} four bays deep, with central doorways crowned by fanlights {{on the first}} and second floors of the front. The central three bays of the front facade are fronted by a monumental tetrastyle Doric portico, with a full-width <b>cantilevered</b> second <b>floor</b> balcony. The Greek Revival portico was added after the {{completion}} of the main house, which was originally built in the Federal style. The original octagonal detached kitchen was destroyed in a fire around 1900. Another octagonal dependency, with a tent-like flared roof, was then moved and connected to the rear porch of the main house to serve as a kitchen. The rear porch was enclosed in 1978.|$|R
5000|$|Pitts' Folly is {{a two-story}} wood frame {{structure}} with wooden clapboarding. The roof is gabled {{on the east}} and west sides, with a flat roof over the portico. The front and eastern elevations feature a two-story portico with fourteen masonry Doric columns, nine across the front and five on the east side. A <b>cantilevered</b> second <b>floor</b> balcony wraps both sides of the house under the portico. The interior is divided on both floors by a central hallway. Several rooms feature decorative plasterwork. [...] The house and grounds were surveyed in 1935 and 1936 by the Historic American Buildings Survey. [...] It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.|$|R
25|$|In 2002, the {{structure}} was repaired permanently using post-tensioning. The living room flagstone floor blocks were individually tagged and removed.
