The following treatments of chicken thighs were used: Air-packaging control samples, control vacuum-packaging samples, vacuum-packaging with EDTA solution 1. 50 % w/w, control samples, vacuum-packaging with Menthae crispae aetheroleum essential oil at concentrations 0. 2 % v/w and vacuum-packaging with <b>Coriandri</b> <b>aetheroleum</b> essential oil at concentration 0. 2 % v/w. The quality assessment of all samples was established by microbiological analysis. The microbiological parameters as the total viable count, Enterobacteraceae genera counts, lactic acid bacteria and Pseudomonas spp. were detected. The results of this present study suggest the possibility of application the essential oil of <b>Coriandri</b> <b>aetheroleum</b> and Menthae spicata aetheroleum as natural food preservatives and potential sources of antimicrobial ingredients for food industry...|$|E
