The trainsets were mothballed at Amtrak's main maintenance facility in Beech Grove, Indiana. A contributing factor to the withdrawal was the spike in fuel prices after the Yom Kippur War.|$|E

25|$|In the 1800s {{the island}} became {{the site of}} the Boston and Albany Railroad's (B) {{passenger}} depot, shops, freight houses, round house, and <b>coach</b> <b>yard.</b> The island was the site of transfers between trains of the New York Central and the B The island became known as the Boston and Albany Island, or just Boston Island. A ferry transported people to and from the island and downtown Albany at Maiden Lane. The railroad changed the shoreline of the island by building docks for receiving coal and grain and by dredging an east-west channel splitting the island in half. In 1871 the Maiden Lane Bridge was built replacing the ferry. When the NY Central and the B merged in 1900 the island's activities became less important, though a new round house and <b>coach</b> <b>yard</b> was built even as many buildings were demolished. In 1903 the channel that separated the island from the mainland was filled in with sand dredged {{from the bottom of the}} Hudson River. Also in 1903 the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad purchased outright the island from the van Rensselaer family for $6,000.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, some {{stations}} {{have been abandoned}} or closed, and some {{characteristics of the line}} have changed. The Columbus Avenue station in Mount Vernon was closed in the Penn Central era, due to its proximity to Mt. Vernon station and the expense of converting it to high-level platforms. It had previously been a transfer station to the overhead viaduct station of the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway; an impressive ruin remains and is easily visible from passing trains. Other stations abandoned along the mainline include Devon, at the junction of the Waterbury Branch, and Norwalk, replaced by South Norwalk. The changeover from catenary to third rail was moved from Woodlawn to just west of Pelham in the early 1990s. There is an abandoned <b>coach</b> <b>yard</b> just east of Port Chester station.|$|E
25|$|Ivy City {{is a small}} {{neighborhood}} in Northeast Washington, D.C., in the United States. About half the neighborhood is industrial or formerly industrial, dominated by warehouses. The Ivy City Yard, a railroad <b>coach</b> <b>yard</b> and maintenance facility for the passenger railroad Amtrak, is situated northwest across New York Avenue NE. Ivy City was laid out as a suburban development for African Americans in 1873. Development was slow. From 1879 to 1901, the neighborhood hosted the Ivy City Racetrack, a major horse racing facility in the District of Columbia. Construction on the rail yard began in 1907 and was complete within a year, {{although much of the}} facilities there were demolished in 1953 and 1954 as railroads switched from coal-fired locomotives to diesel-fueled or electric engines. The Alexander Crummell School, a major focal point of the community, opened in 1911. After some years of enrollment decline, it closed in 1972 but has not been demolished. The area has undergone some gentrification in the 21st century, although people living in the residential core of Ivy City remain very poor and unemployment is high.|$|E

50|$|With weight {{split between}} powered and {{unpowered}} axles the S motors were never completely satisfactory at pulling long heavy trains at high speed. The 1907 accident only made matters worse with additional unpowered axles being added and new speed restrictions imposed. Finally in 1913 the {{new class of}} T-Motors arrived, displacing the S Motors from first line service. For the next 60 years the S-motors were assigned to short local commuter trains and empty equipment movements between Grand Central and the <b>Coach</b> <b>Yards</b> at Mott Haven. They were later re-numbered into the 1100 series and ultimately the 100 series with some examples surviving the Penn Central merger. The combination of the New Haven's new 60 unit strong electro-diesel FL-9 to handle short commuter trains and the drastic reduction in long distance passenger trains using the Mott Haven <b>coach</b> <b>yards</b> eventually ended these niche applications as well. Their final assignment was switching service in the underground yards of Grand Central Terminal. The last S motor, #115, was finally retired from Conrail commuter operations in 1981 after 75 years in service, being replaced by GE E-10 steeplecab units purchased second hand from the Niagara Junction Railroad.|$|R

25|$|To {{accommodate}} ever-growing {{rail traffic}} into the restricted Midtown area, Wilgus {{took advantage of}} the recent electrification technology to propose a novel scheme: a bi-level station below ground. Arriving trains would go underground under Park Avenue, and proceed to an upper-level incoming station if they were mainline trains, or to a lower-level platform if they were suburban trains. In addition, turning loops within the station itself obviated complicated switching moves to bring back the trains to the <b>coach</b> <b>yards</b> for servicing. Departing mainline trains reversed into upper-level platforms in the conventional way. New track infrastructure allowed maximum train speeds of , as well as a massive four-floor, 400-lever signal tower to control the suburban trains.|$|R

50|$|The Pennsylvania Railroad's class DD1 were semi-permanently coupled {{pairs of}} third rail direct current {{electric}} locomotives {{built for the}} railroad's initial New York-area electrification. They operated between Manhattan Transfer and Pennsylvania Station in New York City, {{and from there to}} the <b>coach</b> <b>yards</b> at Sunnyside Yard in Queens, New York. Some also operated on the PRR-owned Long Island Rail Road's extensive third rail network. They had a wheel arrangement of 4-4-0+0-4-4 in the Whyte notation; in other words, two 4-4-0 locomotives coupled back-to-back, hence its class letter, as the Pennsylvania listed all 4-4-0s under Class D. In the AAR wheel arrangement notation, this is described as 2B+B2. Each half-locomotive contained one large electric motor mounted in the body and driving via a jackshaft and side rods. Those electric motors gave the DD1 a potential top speed of 85 mph, though PRR/LIRR timetables never allowed more than 65 mph. The simplicity and reliability of these locomotives allowed it to outlast its potential replacement model, the PRR L5.|$|R
