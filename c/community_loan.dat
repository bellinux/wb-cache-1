50|$|In the 1980s, ICE began popularizing a new {{notion of}} the CLT, {{applying}} {{the model for the}} first time to problems of affordable housing, gentrification, displacement, and neighborhood revitalization in urban areas. From 1980-90, Chuck Matthei, an activist with roots in the Catholic Worker movement and the peace movement, served as Executive Director of ICE, then based in Greenfield, MA and now an affiliate of the National Housing Trust and located in Washington, DC. ICE pioneered the modern community land trust and <b>community</b> <b>loan</b> fund models. During Matthei's tenure, the number of community land trusts increased from a dozen to more than 100 groups in 23 states, creating many hundreds of permanently affordable housing units, as well as commercial and public service facilities. With colleagues Matthei guided the development of 25 regional loan funds and organized the National Association of Community Development Loan Funds, later known as the National Community Capital Association. From 1985-90, Matthei served as a founding Chairman of the Association and from 1983-88 he served as a founding board member of the Social Investment Forum, the national professional association in the field of socially responsible investment. Matthei also launched an effort in the early to mid-1980s to address many of the legal and operational questions about CLTs that were arising as banks, public officials and others encountered the growing effort to create such community-based organizations around the country.|$|E

40|$|As {{stated in}} the thesis project, "For the past two years, {{concerned}} community organizations in Ottawa-Carleton have been meeting to discuss {{the establishment of a}} <b>Community</b> <b>Loan</b> Fund in the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton(RMOC). In early 1993, the Community Enterprise Centre(CEC) released funding to assist in the financing of the fund's development. The CEC is a community based organization which promotes and supports activities that improve the economic health and sustainability of local communities through partnerships, advocacy and demonstrated leadership on community economic development (CED) issues. The CEC struck a steering committee to develop a loan fund and contracted the Social Investment Organization(SIO) to facilitate the development of a model for the fund through a process which included several consultations over a two-month period with community stakeholders. In June, the steering committee issued a press release announcing the creation of the Ottawa-Carleton <b>Community</b> <b>Loan</b> Fund(OCCLF) and committed the fund to begin lending operations in the fall of 1993. At {{the same time that the}} CEC was working on setting up the OCCLF, the Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs(MMA) was circulating a discussion paper on establishing a provincial <b>Community</b> <b>Loan</b> Fund Guarantee Program. In August 1993 the model developed by SIO and the MMA's discussion paper were presented at a meeting of community stakeholders. The meeting endorsed the work to done to date and agreed to strike a working group with broad representation and appropriate skills to establish the OCCLF and to qualify as one of thirty five <b>community</b> <b>loan</b> funds to be supported by the MMA program when the appropriate legislation was passed. The Community Economic Development Act was passed in the Ontario legislature in December 1993. The legislation earmarked $ 10 million to guarantee the principal of loans made by a proposed 35 <b>community</b> <b>loan</b> funds in Ontario over the next five years. The proposed MMA process envisioned that sponsors of <b>community</b> <b>loan</b> funds would express their interest in being selected for participation in this program through a request for proposals. These proposals would include a business plan with such outlines as: a financial management plan, a long-term marketing plan, sources of investment capital, technical support, etc. The community groups who were selected would be eligible to receive financial assistance of $ 15, 000 to move into the start-up phase which included: incorporation, the development of bylaws, an offering statement to investors, registration, etc. " (Library-derived description) Brown, G.
