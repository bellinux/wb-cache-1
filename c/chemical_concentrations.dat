2500|$|Due to its advantages, TKTD models {{may be more}} {{powerful}} than the traditional dose-response models because of their incorporation of <b>chemical</b> <b>concentrations</b> as well as temporal dimensions. [...] Toxicodynamic modeling (such as TKTD models) {{has been shown to be}} a useful tool for toxicological research, with increasing opportunities to use these results in risk assessment to permit a more scientifically based risk assessment that is less reliable on animal testing. [...] Overall, these types of models can formalize knowledge about the toxicity of toxicants and organism sensitivity, create new hypotheses, and simulate temporal aspects of toxicity, making them useful tools for risk assessment.|$|E
2500|$|A 2002 {{study by}} the U.S. Geological Survey found {{detectable}} quantities {{of one or more}} chemicals in 80 percent of a sampling of 139 susceptible streams in 30 states. The most common pharmaceuticals detected were [...] nonprescription drugs; detergents, fire retardants, pesticides, natural and synthetic hormones, and an assortment of antibiotics and prescription medications were also found. A 2006 study found detectable concentrations of 28 pharmaceutical compounds in sewage treatment plant effluents, surface water, and sediment. The therapeutic classes included antibiotics, analgesics and anti-inflammatories, lipid regulators, beta-blockers, anti-convulsant, and steroid hormones. Although most <b>chemical</b> <b>concentrations</b> were detected at low levels (nano-grams/Liter (ng/L)), there are uncertainties that remain regarding the levels at which toxicity occurs and the risks of bioaccumulation of these pharmaceutical compounds. [...] A study published in late 2014 reported a spike in the levels of ecstasy, ketamine, caffeine and acetaminophen in nearby rivers coinciding with a Taiwanese youth event attended by around 600,000 people. Besides the identified input from human medicine there appears diffuse pollution for example from pharmaceuticals used in agriculture, too. Investigations in Germany, France and Scotland showed traces of PPCPs upstream of waste water treatment plant effluents to rivers, too.|$|E

50|$|A {{concentration}} cell generates electricity from {{the reduction in}} the thermodynamic free energy of the electrochemical system as the difference in the <b>chemical</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the two half-cells is reduced. The same reaction occurs in the half-cells but in opposite directions, increasing the lower and decreasing the higher concentration. The energy is generated from thermal energy that the cell absorbs as heat, as the electricity flows. This generation of electricity from ambient thermal energy, without a temperature gradient, is possible because the convergence of the <b>chemical</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the two half-cells increases entropy, and this increase more than compensates for the entropy decrease when heat is converted into electrical energy.|$|E
50|$|The Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) is {{a series}} of remote sensing {{satellite}} instruments used to study the chemical composition of earth's atmosphere. Specifically, SAGE has been used to study the Earth's ozone layer and aerosols at the troposphere through the stratosphere. The SAGE instruments use solar occultation measurement technique to determine <b>chemical</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the atmosphere. Solar occultation measurement technique measures sunlight through the atmosphere and ratios that measurement with a sunlight measurement without atmospheric attenuation. This is achieved by observing sunrises and sunsets during a satellite orbit. Physically, the SAGE instruments measure ultraviolet/visible energy and this is converted via algorithms to determine <b>chemical</b> <b>concentrations.</b> SAGE data has been used to study the atmospheres aerosols, ozone, water vapor, and other trace gases.|$|E

The next experiment we did was to use a more realistic model by having an environment composed of concentration gradients and by adding input current noise to all neurons. We used a realistic model of diffusive noise and showed that it could improve the agent???s behaviour if used within a certain range.
