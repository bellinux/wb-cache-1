25|$|In 1892, Francis Bellamy created {{what was}} known as the Bellamy salute. It started with the hand outstretched toward the flag, palm down, and ended with the palm up. Because of the {{similarity}} between the Bellamy salute and the Nazi salute, which was adopted in Germany later, the US Congress stipulated that the hand-over-the-heart gesture as the salute to be rendered by civilians during the Pledge of Allegiance and the national anthem in the US would be the salute to replace the Bellamy salute. Removal of the Bellamy salute occurred on December 22, 1942, when Congress amended the Flag <b>Code</b> <b>language</b> first passed into law on June 22, 1942. Attached to bills passed in Congress in 2008 and then in 2009 (Section 301(b)(1)of title 36, United States <b>Code),</b> <b>language</b> was included which authorized all active duty military personnel and all veterans in civilian clothes to render a proper hand salute during the raising and lowering of the flag, when the colors are presented, and during the National Anthem.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2015, {{during a}} video conference {{to promote the}} {{documentary}} Terminal F about Edward Snowden, Bolivia's ambassador to Russia, María Luisa Ramos Urzagaste, accused Assange of putting the life of Bolivian president Evo Morales at risk by intentionally providing the United States with false rumours that Snowden was on the president's plane when it was forced to land in Vienna in July 2013. [...] "It is possible that in this wide-ranging game that you began my president did not play a crucial role, but what you did was not important to my president, but it was to me and the citizens of our country. And I have faith that when you planned this game you took into consideration the consequences", the ambassador told Assange. Assange stated that the plan [...] "was not completely honest, but we did consider that the final result would have justified our actions. We weren't expecting this outcome. The result {{was caused by the}} United States' intervention. We can only regret what happened." [...] Later, in an interview with Democracy Now!, Assange explained the story of the grounding of Morales' plane, saying that after the United States cancelled Snowden's passport, WikiLeaks thought about other strategies to take him to Latin America, and they considered private presidential jets of those countries which offered support. The appointed jet was that of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, but Assange stated that [...] "our <b>code</b> <b>language</b> that we used deliberately swapped the presidential jet that we were considering for the Bolivian jet [...] and in some of our communications, we deliberately spoke about that on open lines to lawyers in the United States. And we didn’t think much more of it. [...] We didn’t think this was anything more than just distracting." [...] Eventually, the plan was not pursued and, under Assange's advice, Snowden sought asylum in Russia.|$|E

40|$|Computer {{programs}} {{for the analysis of}} human behaviour captured in multimedia data format commonly provide mechanisms to describe the behaviour recorded. Yet these programs do not satisfactorily fulfil the need for a description mechanism which allows the production of rich descriptions of behaviour in a flexible way and which facilitates the correct and complete retrieval of descriptions according to their meaning. In this paper a new <b>coding</b> <b>language</b> for the natural language like description of human behaviour, the Flexible Structured <b>Coding</b> <b>Language</b> (FSCL) is introduced.
