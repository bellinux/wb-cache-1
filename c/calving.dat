5|$|Pilot whales {{have one}} of the longest birth {{intervals}} of the cetaceans, <b>calving</b> once every three to five years. Most matings and calvings occur during the summer for long-finned pilot whales. For short-finned pilot whales of the Southern Hemisphere, births are at their highest in spring and autumn, while in Northern Hemisphere, the time in which <b>calving</b> peaks can vary by population. For long-finned pilot whales, gestation lasts 12–16 months, and short-finned pilot whales have a 15-month gestation period.|$|E
5|$|The {{advancing}} and retreating {{characteristics of}} the glaciers in the Glacier Bay are explained in simple terms as a steady state of snow getting converted into ice on the hills. Ice, as a lens {{of water on the}} base of bedrock, slides by gravity downwards. The good moraine of rock and rubble insulates it from water erosion. As a result, during freezing temperatures that exists all the year, the glacier advances. When the insulation and erosion effect of the hills gets reduced erosion sets in and along with rising temperatures the glaciers start retreating. Another unpredictable phenomenon that is observed in many glaciers in the Glacier Bay is that of <b>calving.</b> <b>Calving</b> is a process in which blocks of ice get detached or break off from the glacier, irrespective of weather conditions, all the year round, and crash into the sea with thundering noise creating a boiling like turbulence.|$|E

The location of winter breeding areas is still unknown, since these whales tend to migrate in the open ocean.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess in vivo blood oxygen binding in double-muscled <b>calves</b> {{and dairy}} <b>calves</b> with {{conventional}} muscle conformation. ANIMALS: 58 dairy and 48 double-muscled <b>calves.</b> PROCEDURE: <b>Calves</b> {{were classified as}} neonatal (24 hours old) or older <b>calves</b> (2 to 26 days old). Venous and arterial blood samples were collected, and hemoglobin concentration, pH, PCO 2, and PO 2 were determined. Blood oxygen equilibrium curves (OEC) under standard conditions were constructed, and the oxygen exchange fraction (OEF) {{and the amount of}} oxygen released at the tissue level by 100 ml of blood (OEF Vol%) were calculated. RESULTS: In each breed, partial pressure of oxygen at 50 % saturation of hemoglobin (P 50) under standard conditions was significantly higher in older than in neonatal <b>calves,</b> indicating a right shift in OEC with age. Venous P 50 was significantly lower in neonatal double-muscled <b>calves</b> than in neonatal dairy <b>calves,</b> but arterial and venous P 50 were significantly higher in older double-muscled <b>calves</b> than in older dairy <b>calves.</b> In double-muscled, but not in dairy, <b>calves,</b> OEF was significantly higher in older than in neonatal <b>calves.</b> In neonatal <b>calves,</b> OEF Vol% was not significantly different between breeds, but OEF Vol% was significantly higher in older double-muscled <b>calves</b> than in older dairy <b>calves.</b> CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The lower OEF in neonatal double-muscled <b>calves,</b> compared with dairy <b>calves,</b> could contribute to the higher sensitivity of double-muscled <b>calves</b> to hypoxia.

Thirty-two newborn Holstein–Friesian <b>calves</b> were grouped into 7 experimental groups of 4, consisting of 2 inoculated (IN) <b>calves,</b> and 2 contact-exposed (CE) <b>calves,</b> and 1 control pen with 4 non-exposed <b>calves.</b> <b>Calves</b> were group housed for 3  months, with fecal samples were collected 3 times per week, blood and environmental samples weekly, and tissue samples at the end of the trial. The IN <b>calves</b> exited the trial after 3  months of group housing, whereas CE <b>calves</b> were individually housed for an additional 3  months before euthanasia. Control <b>calves</b> were group-housed for the entire trial. All CE and IN <b>calves</b> had MAP-positive fecal samples during the period of group housing; however, fecal shedding had ceased at time of individual housing.

Hydration and signs of depression were scored. Venous and arterial blood samples were collected, and 2, 3 -diphosphoglycerate, ATP, chloride, inorganic phosphate, lactate, pyruvate, total protein, albumin, and hemoglobin concentrations, and Hct, pH, Pco 2, and PO 2 were determined. Oxygen equilibrium curves (OEC) were constructed under standard conditions, and oxygen extraction ratios were calculated. RESULTS: Recumbent <b>calves</b> of both breed-types were more dehydrated and had more severe signs of depression than ambulatory affected <b>calves.</b> In both breed-types, hemoglobin oxygen affinity was increased in <b>calves</b> with diarrhea, compared with healthy <b>calves,</b> as indicated by a decrease in standard partial oxygen pressure (P 50). Diarrhea induced hypocapnia and hypothermia in the most severely affected <b>calves,</b> which counteracted the acidosis-induced right shift in arterial and venous OEC. Arterial and venous P 50 were significantly less in double-muscled <b>calves</b> with diarrhea than healthy <b>calves,</b> whereas P 50 for affected dairy <b>calves</b> {{were similar to those}} of healthy <b>calves.</b> Except in the most severely affected dairy <b>calves,</b> oxygen extraction ratio was significantly less in <b>calves</b> with diarrhea, compared with healthy <b>calves.</b> CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Release of oxygen from blood may be impaired in <b>calves</b> with diarrhea, depending on the effect of the disease on certain blood biochemical variables.

Since hunting of the {{southern right whale}} ceased, stocks are estimated to have grown by 7% a year.

5|$|Killer {{whales are}} apex predators {{throughout}} their global distribution, and {{can have a}} profound effect on the behavior and population of prey species. Their diet is very broad and they can feed on many vertebrates in the ocean including salmon, rays, sharks (even white sharks), large baleen whales, and nearly 20 species of pinniped. The predation of whale calves may be responsible for annual whale migrations to <b>calving</b> grounds in more tropical waters, where the population of killer whales is much lower than in polar waters. Prior to whaling, it is thought that great whales were a major food source; however, after their sharp decline, killer whales have since expanded their diet, leading to the decline of smaller marine mammals. A decline in Aleutian Islands sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed a decline in harbor seal and Steller sea lion populations, the killer whale's preferred prey, which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now reduced by industrial whaling.|$|E

One-half of the <b>calves</b> in each treatment were provided with ad libitum cut perennial ryegrass herbage. Grass intakes and time spent eating grass were greater for grouped <b>calves</b> than for individual <b>calves.</b> Providing grass reduced concentrate intake of grouped <b>calves</b> and reduced the time that all <b>calves,</b> but particularly individual <b>calves,</b> spent eating straw bedding. Ruminating time was increased by offering grass to grouped <b>calves</b> compared with individual <b>calves.</b> Grass reduced the frequency of <b>calves</b> licking their buckets and their pen, vocalizing, and investigating their pen.

5|$|Limousins {{have become}} popular {{because of their}} low birth weights (ease of <b>calving),</b> higher than average {{dressing}} percentage (ratio of carcase to live weight) and yield (ratio of meat to carcase), high feed conversion efficiency, {{and their ability to}} produce lean, tender meat. A major multi-breed study reported that Limousins converted feed into saleable meat more efficiently and significantly faster than popular British breeds, and marginally faster than other popular continental European cattle breeds. Conversely, the other cattle breeds produced proportionally more low-cost by-product and waste, which resulted in their live weight growth being faster than Limousins.

5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is preyed on by lions, leopards, African {{wild dogs}} and hyenas and predation {{is the main}} cause of death. They are also prone to outbreaks of disease which may also lead to a decline in numbers. Major human-related factors affecting populations include large-scale deforestation, the drying up of water sources, the expansion of settlements and poaching. Diseases of domestic cattle such as sleeping sickness can be transmitted to the animals and take their toll. The erection of fences that interrupt traditional migratory routes between wet and dry-season ranges have resulted in mass death events when the animals become cut off from water sources and the areas of better grazing they are seeking during droughts. A study of the factors influencing wildebeest populations in the Maasai Mara ecosystem revealed that the populations had undergone a drastic decline of around 80% from about 119,000 individuals in 1977 to around 22,000 twenty years later. The major cause of this was thought to be the expansion of agriculture, which led to the loss of wet season grazing and the traditional <b>calving</b> and breeding ranges. Similarly, drastic declines have recently occurred in the Tarangire wildebeest migration.|$|E
5|$|The {{golden jackal}} often hunts alone, and {{sometimes}} in pairs, but rarely hunts in a pack. When hunting alone, it trots around an area and occasionally stops to sniff and listen. Once prey is located, the jackal conceals itself, quickly approaches its prey and then pounces on it. Single jackals hunt rodents, hares, and birds. They hunt rodents in grass by locating them with their hearing before leaping {{into the air and}} pouncing on them. In India, they can dig Indian gerbils out from their burrows, and they can hunt young, old, and infirm ungulates up to 4–5 times their body weight. Jackals search for hiding blackbuck calves throughout the day during the <b>calving</b> period. The peak times for their searches are the early morning and the late evening. When hunting in pairs or packs, jackals run parallel to their prey and overtake it in unison. When hunting aquatic rodents or birds, they will run along both sides of narrow rivers or streams and drive their prey from one jackal to another.|$|E
5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} is a gregarious {{animal with}} a complex social structure comprising three distinct groups : firstly, the female herds, consisting of adult females and their young; secondly, the bachelor herds, consisting only of yearlings and older males; thirdly, the territorial bulls. The number of females per herd is variable, generally ranging from 14 to 32, but is {{highest in the}} densest populations and also increases with forage density. There is a strong attachment {{among members of the}} female herd, many of whom are related to each other. Large herds often get divided into smaller groups. While small calves stay with their mothers, the older ones form groups of their own within the herd. These herds have a social hierarchy, and the females are rather aggressive towards others trying to join the group. Young males are generally repelled by their mothers before the <b>calving</b> season starts. Separation of a young calf from its mother can be a major cause of calf mortality. While some male yearlings stay within the female herd, the others join a bachelor herd. These are usually loose associations and, unlike the female herds, the individuals are not much attached to each other. Another difference between the female and bachelor herds is the lesser aggression {{on the part of the}} males. These bachelor herds move widely in the available habitat and act as a refuge for males that have been unsuccessful as territorial bulls, and also as a reserve for future breeding males.|$|E

40|$|Thirty-six dairy <b>calves</b> were {{observed}} {{for four months}} {{to determine the effect}} of three housing methods, group, individual and isolated on body weight gain, feed consumption, age when started to consume grain, daily activity patterns, open field test of behavior and social rank. Six <b>calves</b> were assigned to each of the three treatments in two separate trials of eighteen <b>calves.</b> These <b>calves</b> were raised in their treatment for approximately two months and then weaned and placed together in a group of eighteen for two more months. Treatments ranked in order from high to low according to least squares means for weight gain over four months were: group, individual and isolated. The differences were, however, not significant (P 3 ̆e. 05). There was a significant difference in weight gain from weaning until four months between the group <b>calves</b> and the isolated <b>calves,</b> with the group <b>calves</b> gaining weight faster during this weaned period (P 3 ̆c. 05). Group <b>calves</b> began consuming grain at a younger age (P 3 ̆c. Ol) than the <b>calves</b> on the other two treatments, but total feed consumed over the first 10 weeks was not significantly different (P 3 ̆e. 05). Isolated <b>calves</b> tended to spend a greater portion of the time lying down than <b>calves</b> in the other two treatments but the difference was not significant (P 3 ̆e. 05). In the open-field test isolated <b>calves</b> entered more squares than the group or individual <b>calves,</b> but the group <b>calves</b> were the most vocal of the <b>calves</b> in the three treatments (P 3 ̆c. Ol). The group <b>calves</b> placed higher in the social order and won a higher percentage of encounters (P 3 ̆c. Ol) than the individual or isolated <b>calves</b> during the weaned period...|$|R
40|$|Bull {{and steer}} <b>calves</b> of mixed breed type were shipped from Newport, Tennessee to Manhattan, Kansas. Bull <b>calves</b> were {{castrated}} on arrival at Manhattan. <b>Calves</b> were classified into four breed-types as follows: (1) black, polled, medium-frame, number one muscling; (2) white-faced, feather-necked, medium-frame, number one muscling; (3) black or red with white face, medium frame, number one muscling; and (4) large-frame, mixed-color <b>calves.</b> The <b>calves</b> were in transit for 24 hours. <b>Calves</b> purchased and transported as steers outgained those purchased as bulls and castrated upon feedlot arrival by 26 lbs during the receiving phase and by 13 lbs on pasture. Fewer steer <b>calves</b> died than castrated bulls (7. 7 % vs. 13. 2 %). Steer <b>calves</b> had higher BVD antibody titers than bulls. Medium-frame, number one muscled, white-faced <b>calves</b> {{had a higher}} mortality rate (18. 4 %) than the average of other breed types (7. 4 %). The large-frame, number one muscled, mixed-color <b>calves</b> had the highest total gain...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the performances of <b>calves</b> fed acidified milk replacer (AMR) or sweet (regular) milk replacer (SMR) at 8 % of birth weight. Twenty-one <b>calves</b> (10 males, 11 females) were offered replacers reconstituted to 12 % of dry matter over 5 weeks. In the group fed AMR, daily body weight gains of <b>calves</b> at the different stages of growth were comparable to those for <b>calves</b> fed SMR. In the preweaning period, <b>calves</b> offered AMR had similar dry matter intakes from starter, milk replacer and dry hay as well as total intake as those fed SMR. In the postweaning phase, total dry matter intakes of <b>calves</b> offered AMR and SMR were not statistically different. The overall feed efficiency ratios of AMR-fed <b>calves</b> were better (P < 0. 05) than those of SMR-fed <b>calves.</b> Calf faecal consistency score (P < 0. 05) and percent days with scours (P < 0. 01) of <b>calves</b> offered AMR were significantly lower than those fed SMR for days 4 to 17. AMR-fed <b>calves</b> needed a longer time (P < 0. 01) to consume the daily amount of replacer than SMR-fed <b>calves.</b> The <b>calves</b> fed AMR also took a significantly (P < 0. 05) greater number of days to learn to drink milk replacer from an open pail without help than <b>calves</b> consuming SMR. In conclusion, it is suggested that the growth performance and feed efficiency characteristics of <b>calves</b> reared under the new feeding system with AMR were not adversely affected, but the incidence of scours of the young <b>calves</b> was dramatically reduced...|$|R
