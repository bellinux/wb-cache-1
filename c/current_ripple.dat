40|$|This study {{presents}} the small scale bedform states found off the South-Holland coast during a 31 + days field observation of seabed acoustic imagery {{and near the}} bed velocities. Six main bed states were encountered: <b>current</b> <b>ripples</b> (C), wave ripples (W), combined wave-current <b>ripples</b> (WC), <b>current</b> <b>ripples</b> with subordinate wave ripples (Cw), wave <b>ripples</b> with subordinate <b>current</b> <b>ripples</b> (Wc) and poorly developed ripples (P). Direct visual detection of the bed state from the images showed good agreement with a simple predictor based on the mobility number. The most frequent type of bedform was C which is governed by the tidal <b>currents.</b> Wave <b>ripple</b> prevailed only during a storm with waves higher than 2 m. The combined Cw, WC and Wc types comprised 22 % of the occurrences. Poorly developed ripples {{were associated with the}} neap tide during fair weather conditions...|$|R

50|$|Classic, low-density turbidites are {{characterized}} by graded bedding, <b>current</b> <b>ripple</b> marks, climbing ripple laminations, alternating sequences with pelagic sediments, distinct fauna changes between the turbidite and native pelagic sediments, sole markings, thick sediment sequences, regular bedding, and an absence of shallow-water features (Fairbridge, 1966). A different vertical progression of sedimentary structures characterize high-density turbidites.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Current</b> <b>ripple</b> marks, {{unidirectional}} ripples, or asymmetrical {{ripple marks}} are asymmetrical in profile, {{with a gentle}} up-current slope and a steeper down-current slope. The down-current slope is the angle of repose, which depends on {{the shape of the}} sediment. These commonly form in fluvial and aeolian depositional environments, and are a signifier of {{the lower part of the}} Lower Flow Regime.|$|E
5000|$|The {{switching}} {{frequency of the}} transistors is not constant. However, by controlling {{the width of the}} tolerance bands the average {{switching frequency}} can be kept roughly at its reference value. This also keeps the current and torque ripple small. Thus the torque and <b>current</b> <b>ripple</b> are of the same magnitude as with vector controlled drives with the same switching frequency.|$|E

The fragmentary material is diagonally cross-bedded agreed with the dip of the distal slope. Irrespective {{of the age of}} the ridges (normally, it is the time of the last late- and post-glacial age) the sediments are loose and dry, fragments are not hardened with loamy and silt.|$|E
5000|$|The GTO {{thyristor}} achieves this by [...] "chopping" [...] {{the supply}} voltage {{in order to}} drive a sinusoidal current in the motor windings (pulse width modulation), creating the characteristic whine associated with the stock and with the Class 465 Networker trains that share its traction drive system. The sound changes as the pulse length changes. The noise is produced by the switching frequency <b>current</b> <b>ripple</b> and the resulting torque pulsation experienced by the rotor of the induction machine.|$|E

A decoupling term {{is sometimes}} {{added to the}} controller output to improve control performance to mitigate cross coupling or big and rapid changes in speed, current and flux linkage. PI-controller also sometimes need low-pass filtering at the input or output to prevent the <b>current</b> <b>ripple</b> due to transistor switching from being amplified excessively and destabilizing the control. However, such filtering also limits the dynamic control system performance. High switching frequency (typically more than 10 kHz) is typically required to minimize filtering requirements for high-performance drives such as servo drives.|$|E

50|$|The H-1 {{flexible}} Heliac is a three field-period helical axis stellarator {{located in}} the ANU Research School of Physics and Engineering at Canberra, Australia. Optimisation of the H-1 power supplies for low <b>current</b> <b>ripple</b> allows precise control of the ratio of secondary (helical, vertical) coil to primary (poloidal, toroidal) coil currents, resulting in a finely tunable magnetic geometry. Slight variation in the current ratio between shots (plasma discharges) in a sequence corresponds to a high resolution parameter scan through magnetic configurations (i.e.: rotational transform profile, magnetic well). The programmable control system allows for repetition rates of around 30 shots per hour, limited by data acquisition time and magnet cooling time.|$|E

50|$|The second CSI {{modulation}} category, SHE is also {{similar to}} its VSI counterpart. Utilizing the gating signals developed for a VSI {{and a set}} of synchronizing sinusoidal current signals, results in symmetrically distributed shorting pulses and, therefore, symmetrical gating patterns. This allows any arbitrary number of harmonics to be eliminated. It also allows control of the fundamental line current through the proper selection of primary switching angles. Optimal switching patterns must have quarter-wave and half-wave symmetry, as well as symmetry about 30 degrees and 150 degrees. Switching patterns are never allowed between 60 degrees and 120 degrees. The <b>current</b> <b>ripple</b> can be further reduced with the use of larger output capacitors, or by increasing the number of switching pulses.|$|E

40|$|Recently, reduced {{common-mode}} voltage (CMV) pulsewidth modulation (RCMV-PWM) {{methods have}} been proposed to reduce the leakage current in three-phase transformerless photovoltaic (PV) systems. However, most of these studies only focus on leakage current elimination and neglect the overall performance of the PV systems {{on issues such as}} cost, voltage linearity, dc-link <b>current</b> <b>ripples,</b> and harmonic distortion. In this paper, a three-phase transformerless inverter, adapted from the single-phase H 5 topology, is investigated. Since the H 5 topology has been conventionally developed for a single-phase system, its adaptation to the three-phase system requires the development of corresponding three-phase modulation techniques. Hence, modulation techniques are proposed based on conventional PWM. The performances of the proposed PWM, in terms of CMV, leakage current, voltage linearity, output <b>current</b> <b>ripples,</b> dc-link <b>current</b> <b>ripples,</b> and harmonic distortion are studied and discussed via simulation and experiment. It is proven that the proposed topology is able reduce the leakage current without sacrificing the overall performance of the system...|$|R
