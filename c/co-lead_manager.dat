40|$|The paper investigates analyst {{recommendations}} for internet firms that went public during 1997 - 2000. Our {{contribution to the}} literature is that we match {{recommendations for}} the same firm issued by different investment banks that have published the recommendations in an interval around the same date. By examining paired recommendations all characteristics (observed but also unobserved) will be the same. The latter analyses offer empirical results that are different from analyses that do not control {{for the possibility that}} different types of investment banks issue recommendations for different firms. Furthermore, our empirical results provide evidence that an investment analyst recommendation is more favorable when the NASDAQ stock market is surging, the number of shares in the offering as percentage of the shares outstanding is greater and the analyst affiliation is from a <b>co-lead</b> <b>manager...</b>|$|E

Key for this paper is whether the affiliation of the analyst (lead manager, <b>co-lead</b> <b>manager</b> or unaffiliated brokerage firm) plays a role in the recommendation. Also, we have examined the relation between the analyst recommendation and the prestige of the investment bank. Furthermore, we have run regressions to analyze the relation between the analyst recommendations and both firm-specific and equity market characteristics. Finally, we examine to which extent the analyst recommendations for the same firm around a specific date are qualitatively similar. Our findings provide evidence that the type of investment bank does matter. In general, regardless the periods of time examined the recommendations of the unaffiliated brokerage firms have significantly lower ratings compared to those of each of the other two types of investment banks. The outcome from the regressions shows that analyst recommendations are a decreasing function of the number of shares offered as a percentage of total shares after IPO: the higher this percentage, th...|$|E
