From the binary, ternary, quaternary and quinary mixed guests of B, T, E, O, M and P, the order of preference in the NMe 3 Et+-host is B≫T＞P≒O≒M and E＞O≫P≒M; in the NMeEt 3 +-host is T＞B＞P≫O≒M and E＞P≫M＞O; in the NEt 4 +-host is B≫T≒O≒M≒P. However, the NEt 4 +-host complexes of E, O, M and P mixed-guests were not obtained. These inclusion selectivities were compared to our previous results of the NMe 4 +-host; T＞B＞P≫M＞O and E＞P≫M＞O. Key words: inclusion selectivities, <b>cyanocadmate</b> host complexes, ammonium oniums, aromatic guest molecules Supramolecular chemistry has been {{of great interest to}} chemists because of the potential applicabilities such as the media of molecular recognition, separation, self-assembly and self-organization, etc. 1 Especially, th...|$|E
