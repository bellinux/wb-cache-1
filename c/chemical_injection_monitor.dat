30|$|The RPI {{describes}} the variation {{range of the}} ratio of the injection pressure to the injection rate. However, the injection efficiency is related not only to the variation range of injection pressure and injection rate but also to the variation rate of injection pressure and injection rate.

50|$|There {{are three}} primary {{techniques}} of EOR: gas injection, thermal <b>injection,</b> and <b>chemical</b> <b>injection.</b> Gas injection, which uses gases such as natural gas, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide (CO2), accounts for nearly 60 percent of EOR {{production in the}} United States. Thermal injection, which involves the introduction of heat, accounts for 40 percent of EOR production in the United States, with most of it occurring in California. <b>Chemical</b> <b>injection,</b> which can involve the use of long-chained molecules called polymers to increase the effectiveness of waterfloods, accounts for about one percent of EOR production in the United States. In 2013, a technique called Plasma-Pulse technology was introduced into the United States from Russia. This technique can result in another 50 percent of improvement in existing well production.|$|R

40|$|To realize {{site-specific}} and variable-rate {{application of}} agricultural pesticides, accurately metering and controlling the <b>chemical</b> <b>injection</b> rate is necessary. This study presents {{a prototype of}} a direct nozzle injection system (DNIS) by which chemical concentration transport lag was greatly reduced. In this system, a rapid-reacting solenoid valve (RRV) was utilized for injecting chemicals, driven by a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal at 100 Hz, so with varying pulse width the <b>chemical</b> <b>injection</b> rate could be adjusted. Meanwhile, a closed-loop control strategy, proportional-integral-derivative (PID) method, was applied for metering and stabilizing the <b>chemical</b> <b>injection</b> rate. In order to measure chemical flow rates and input them into the controller as a feedback in real-time, a thermodynamic flowmeter that was independent of chemical viscosity was used. Laboratory tests were conducted to assess the performance of DNIS and PID control strategy. Due to the nonlinear input–output characteristics of the RRV, a two-phase PID control process obtained better effects as compared with single PID control strategy. Test results also indicated that the set-point chemical flow rate could be achieved within less than 4 s, and the output stability was improved compared to the case without control strategy...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of methane hydrate dissociation {{in the presence}} of thermal stimulation, <b>chemical</b> <b>injection,</b> and thermal stimulation in conjunction with <b>chemical</b> <b>injection</b> method were investigated by molecular dynamics simulation. The effect of the injection of liquid water (WTR) and 30 wt% ethylene glycol (EG) solution at 277 K and 340 K on methane hydrate dissociation was studied. The results showed the hydrogen bonds between WTR molecules and the water molecules on the hydrate surface were formed,which destroyed the original hydrogen bond balance of the hydrate. Therefore, the clathrate structure of hydrate collapsed, and the hydrate dissociated. The hydrogen bonds was formed obviously between hydroxyl groups of EG molecules and the water molecules on the hydrate surface; this caused the original stable clathrate structure of the hydrate to be destroyed and collapse, and, furthermore, promoted the dissociation of the methane hydrate and the release of methane gas. Compared with the effects of injecting WTR and 30 wt% EG solution at 277 K and 340 K on the dissociation of methane hydrate, the effectivences was found to be: EG (340 K) > WTR (340 K) > EG (277 K) > WTR (277 K).

30|$|To reduce {{residual}} oil saturation, polymer-augmented alkaline injection was initiated in the Almy Sands at Isenhour Unit in Wyoming in 1985.

A cationic and anionic polyacrylamide spreadhead preceded {{the addition of the}} alkaline agent which was Na 2 CO 3. A tripolyphosphate-anionic polymer blend was injected for long-term wettability control and alkaline slug stability.

40|$|AbstractThe {{technology}} of sealing {{sand and gravel}} by <b>chemical</b> <b>injection</b> has been known and used for a long time. Chemical grouting is however expensive and sometimes the use of cement {{does not lead to}} the desired effect. That is why we are trying to find new materials and methods of injection. Clay and cement are added to a mixture save chemical products. Clay-cement mixes are used not only because they are better quality, but also because these mixtures have a tendency to penetrate better into incoherent sediments that would need an additional sealant of a <b>chemical</b> <b>injection.</b> In order to reduce cost in future, ordinary clay is replaces in the mixture secondary raw materials can be a suitable substitute for ordinary clay to a certain extent. This is true above all for fly ash. This paper deals with the appropriateness of using fly ash (secondary raw material), cement and lime (binders) and liquefying additives and examining their properties in the mixture. The aim of the paper is to propose the optimal injection mixture for additional sealing of earth dams...|$|R
