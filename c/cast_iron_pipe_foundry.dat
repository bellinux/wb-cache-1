50|$|<b>Cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> is a pipe {{which has}} had {{historic}} use as a pressure pipe for transmission of water, gas and sewage, and as a water drainage pipe during the 19th and 20th centuries. It comprises predominantly a gray <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> tube and was frequently used uncoated, although later coatings and linings reduced corrosion and improve hydraulics. <b>Cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> was superseded by ductile <b>iron</b> <b>pipe,</b> which is a direct development, with most existing manufacturing plants transitioning to the new material during the 1970s and 1980s.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{corrosion}} is the predominant mechanism for the deterioration of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes,</b> leading to the reduction of pipe capacity and ultimate collapse of the pipes. In order to assess the remaining service life of corroded <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes,</b> it is imperative to understand the mechanisms of corrosion over a long term and to develop models for pipe deterioration. Although many studies have been carried out to determine the corrosion behavior of <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> little research has been undertaken to understand how <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> behave over a longer time scale than hours, days, or weeks. The present paper intends to fill the gap regarding the long-term corrosion behaviour of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> in the absence of historical data. In this paper, a comprehensive experimental program is presented in which the corrosion behaviour of three exservice pipes was thoroughly examined in three simulated service environments. It has been found in the paper that localised corrosion is the primary form of corrosion of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> water <b>pipes.</b> It has also been found that the microstructure of <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> is a key factor that affects the corrosion behaviour of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes.</b> The paper concludes that long-term tests on corrosion behaviour of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> can help develop models for corrosion-induced deterioration of the pipes for use in predicting the remaining service life of the pipes...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cast</b> <b>iron</b> {{was used}} in the water {{industry}} prior to 1970 and a large number of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> still remain as trunk mains. These pipes have been subjected to different levels of corrosion and variety of loading conditions. This leads <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> to fail in the field without prior warning. Water utilities are seeking solutions to optimise <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> renewal and rehabilitation programs for critical water mains (diameter ≥ 300 mm). A new experimental set-up has been developed at Monash University in order to perform burst testing of large diameter <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> (diameter ≥ 300 mm). A section of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipe,</b> extracted during maintenance in Sydney, was laser scanned to determine the remaining thickness of the pipe (minimum of 7 - 8 mm at the most critical patches). Although the pipe was pressurised to 3. 6 MPa, catastrophic failure did not occur. Water leakage from the two critically corroded patches was observed at around 3. 25 - 3. 45 MPa internal pressure. Strain results on the outer pipe surface were greater than the strain measured during tensile testing of the same pipe material. A 3 -D finite element model using the scanned pipe dimensions was able to predict the maximum pressure at pipe failure (~ 3. 7 MPa) within the range of leaking water pressure level observed in the experiment...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cast</b> <b>iron</b> was the {{dominant}} material for buried pipes for water networks {{prior to the}} 1970 s in Australia and overseas. At present, many water utilities still have {{a significant amount of}} ageing <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes.</b> <b>Cast</b> <b>iron</b> is a brittle material and when large diameter <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> (diameters above 300 mm) further deteriorate, the consequences of failure can be substantial. Focusing on the likelihood of failure to assist risk assessment, this paper examines the performance of large-diameter <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> using probabilistic analysis, incorporating uncertainties of governing variables. Finite element analysis is first conducted to study the physical mechanism of buried pipes subjected to complex environmental conditions. The deterioration of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> due to corrosion is considered on the basis of recent research. The uncertainties of governing variables, such as the physical properties of soil, <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> water pressure and corrosion patterns, in pipe failure risk assessment are considered. Using probabilistic physical modelling, the lifetime probability of failure is derived and a time-dependent sensitivity analysis is presented. The results of this probabilistic physical modelling are compared with cohorts of failure data from two Australian water utilities to examine the underlying trends from both physical modelling and statistical analysis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of pipe characteristics on the bacteriological composition of material mobilised from a drinking water distribution system (DWDS) {{and the impact of}} biofilm removal on water quality. Hydrants in a single UK Distribution Management Area (DMA) with both polyethylene and <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> sections were subjected to incremental increases in flow to mobilise material from the pipe walls. Turbidity was monitored during these operations and water samples were collected for physico-chemical and bacteriological analysis. DNA was extracted from the material mobilised into the bulk water before and during flushing. Bacterial tag-encoded 454 pyrosequencing was then used to characterize the bacterial communities present in this material. Turbidity values were high in the samples from <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes.</b> <b>Iron,</b> aluminium, manganese and phosphate concentrations were found to correlate to observed turbidity. The bacterial community composition of the material mobilised from the pipes was significantly different between plastic and <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> sections (p <  0. 5). High relative abundances of Alphaproteobacteria (23. 3 %), Clostridia (10. 3 %) and Actinobacteria (10. 3 %) were detected in the material removed from plastic pipes. Sequences related to Alphaproteobacteria (22. 8 %), Bacilli (16. 6 %), and Gammaproteobacteria (1. 4 %) were predominant in the samples obtained from <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes.</b> The highest species richness and diversity were found in the samples from material mobilised from plastic pipes.
